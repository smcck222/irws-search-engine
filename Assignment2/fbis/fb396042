  [Text] Brasilia -- On 25 March, Brazil and Cambodia 
normalized relations when representatives from the two countries 
met at United Nations headquarters in New York and signed a 
joint communique. 
  Brazil first established diplomatic relations with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia in 1961, establishing representation in 
Phnom Penh concurrent with the Brazilian Embassy in New Delhi, 
India. Afterward that representation became concurrent with the 
Brazilian Embassy in Bangkok. According to the Brazilian 
Foreign Ministry, the representation in Phnom Penh was closed 
down in 1966, but not because relations had been broken between 
the two countries. Following the internal pacification of 
Cambodia under the leadership of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, which 
was endorsed by Brazilian diplomacy, the Brazilian Government 
suggested the normalization of bilateral relations, which was 
confirmed on 25 March with the joint communique. Brazil will 
open an embassy in Phnom Penh concurrent with the embassy in 
Bangkok.

  [Text] Investigations by the Attorney General's Office have 
linked General Alvaro Velandia to the disappearance and murder 
of a former M-19 [19 April Movement] member. The evidence found 
links Velandia to the arrest, disappearance, and murder of Nidia 
Erica Bautista, a woman who was an M-19 member. Several men 
arrested Nidia on a Bogota street the day her son made his first 
communion in August 1987. 
  [Begin Janet Bautista, Nidia's sister, recording] The 
deposition given by former Officer Bernardo Alfonso Garzon, who 
was then an active member of the 13th Counterintelligence 
Brigade, is very clear. He said the brigade commander at the 
time, Velandia, knew of and approved the plan to murder Nidia. 
[end recording] 
  Based on several testimonies, the guerrilla's body appeared 
at the Guayabetal Cemetery three years later. The Attorney 
General's Office is saying today Velandia, who was a colonel and 
the commanding officer of the Chavez Solano Intelligence 
Battalion at that time, knew of and authorized those events. 
  [Begin Erick Arellana, Nidia's son, recording] This is the 
first step we have seen after waiting for so long and suffering 
so much. I feel it is important, because for so many years 
nothing was done. [end recording] 
  The investigation has also implicated Sergeant Julio Roberto 
Ortega in this case. It is charged he played an active role in 
Nidia Bautista's disappearance. Now, the soldiers will be able 
to present their defense, which will be evaluated by the 
Attorney General's Office before giving its final assessment.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Mar (DPA) -- Following his 
election yesterday as OAS secretary general, Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria today returned to his usual activities, quashing a 
"mini-crisis" in his cabinet with the appointment of Jose Elias 
Melo, a lawyer, as his new labor minister. 
  Melo, 34, replaces Luis Fernando Ramirez, who resigned after 
announcing that he had been chosen to run for vice president by 
opposition Conservative Party presidential candidate Andres 
Pastrana. The new minister, Banking Superintendency chief until 
today, is a member of the Conservative Party, so Gaviria thus 
maintains the political structure of his cabinet, in which 
members of the ruling Liberal Party prevail. 
  The resignation of Ramirez, 35, is the only one that has 
occurred in the wake of the intensive political campaign now 
under way in Colombia for the upcoming 29 May presidential 
elections. Insistent rumors in the press asserted that 
Government (Interior) Minister Fabio Villegas would tender his 
resignation in order to take an important post in the Liberal 
Party's leadership, but this did not happen. Likewise, other 
speculation held that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin would also 
resign and accept the nomination for vice president on 
Pastrana's ticket. But this was ruled out by the foreign 
minister herself, who might be running for president in 1998.

  [Text] The Electoral Law did not pass muster last night at 
the Constitutional Court. Only four of the 24 articles passed 
the constitutionality test. The remainder were declared 
unconstitutional. 
  The Court declared unconstitutional the article that fixed 8 
May for the first round of presidential elections and 19 June 
for the runoff. 
  The Court dismissed Law 84 of 1993. Therefore the old 
Electoral Code enters in force. 
  The Court concluded that the 21 articles declared 
unconstitutional can only be adopted within a statutory law and 
not within a regular law. 
  The Court struck down the regulations that fixed the 
electoral timetable and that blank votes should not be taken 
into account at the time of determining the electoral ratio. 
  At the same time, the Court also struck down the regulations 
that exempt former congressmen from resubmitting their 
qualifications for election when they register as candidates for 
Congress. 
  The Court's ruling took place in an atmosphere of heated 
debate that divided the Court into blocs of five and four 
justices respectively. 
  The Court's majority indicated that Law 84 contradicts what 
is mandated in Article 152, Paragraph C. 
  Specifically, this provision provides that the organization 
and the regulation of political parties and movements -- 
internal voting for mayor and governors, for example -- cannot 
be included within a regular Electoral Law. 
  At the same time the Court left without legal force the 
prohibition on candidates and political parties engaging in 
publicity, giving interviews, or participating in media 
reporting 24 hours before and during the day on which elections 
are held. 
  Through this, the Court revived the use of all kinds of 
mobile or audio propaganda, and the use of t-shirts, flags, 
hats, and similar items related to the elections. 
  In the opinion of the majority of the justices, propaganda 
restrictions can only be fixed through a statutory law, not 
through a regular law. 
  The Court also dismissed the norms that prohibit the media 
from conducting and publicizing polls or public opinion 
inquiries on political or electoral preferences. 
  This was indicated by the Constitutional Court when it 
settled the appeal filed against the Electoral Law (Law 84 of 
1993). 
  The decision handed down yesterday is the result of a 
three-week study, at the end of which four justices dismissed 
the ruling when they decided that these electoral process 
regulations should be fixed through a statutory law, not through 
a regular law. 
  The justices who abstained were Jorge Arango Mejia, 
Vladimiro 
Naranjo Mesa, Carlos Gaviria Diaz, and Jose Gregorio Hernandez. 
  Meanwhile, Justices Hernando Herrera Vargara, Eduardo 
Cifuentes Munoz, Alejandro Martinez, Fabio Moron Diaz, and 
Antonio Barrera Carbonell supported the ruling. 
  According to the plaintiffs, the Electoral Law establishes 
provisions that contradict the Constitution due to errors in 
procedures or nonobservation of formalities. In addition, 
electoral actions can only be regulated through a statutory law. 
  As was said, the Court also concluded that blank votes 
should 
be taken into account. 
  One justice said: "If this is not done, it would imply 
disregard for the voting process." 
  The Court deemed that the blank votes allow gauging of 
trends 
for support or nonsupport of the proposals of the various 
candidates. 
  With regard to regulations that exempt former congressmen 
from resubmitting their qualifications for election when they 
register, the Court said that these prerogatives not only impair 
citizens' equal rights but also impair the guarantee of election 
and being elected established in the Constitution. 
  The ruling (Article 22) that makes possible the election as 
president or vice president of the Republic of senators and 
representatives without application of the qualifier that no one 
can be elected to more than one public corporation or post, 
suffered the same fate. 
  In the Court's view, the provision contradicts Article 179 
of 
the Constitution, according to which "no one can be elected to 
more than one public corporation or post, nor to a corporation 
and a post, if the respective period coincides in time, even if 
only partial." 
  On Justices Eduardo Cifuentes and Hernando Herrera's 
positions, the Court supported provisions that authorize the 
government to adopt budgets for the 1994 elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Camilo Chaparro] </F>
  [Text] With a new approach, the Attorney General's Office 
is beginning to develop the monitoring of human rights and 
maintaining checks on the Armed Forces. Traditionally, the 
Attorney General's Office has only exerted disciplinary control 
over servicemen and policemen, punishing almost exclusively 
flaws in service and abuse of power. Based on a critical 
self-analysis, the office concluded this is not sufficient. 
  That is why now, under the guidance of Deputy Attorney 
General Mauricio Echeverri Gutierrez, the Public Order 
Commission [Comission de Orden Publico] of that office is 
beginning a new strategy to try to exert a more preventive and 
immediate control. The bases of this new control program are 
the regional diagnostics on the public order situation in 
specific zones and the performance pacts in which citizens, the 
Armed Forces, and watchdog organizations participate directly. 
  At the disciplinary level, the novelty of this program is 
that the Attorney General's Office is not only going to punish 
those responsible for an illegal action but also those who by 
omission allowed the illegal action to take place. So far, the 
Attorney General's Office has analyzed the public order 
situation in Santander's Middle Magdalena region, Uraba, south 
of Cesar, and Arauca. 
  In Middle Magdalena, for example, said office conducted a 
study of the complaints against the police and found that most 
of them are related to irregularities during raids, arbitrary 
arrests, abuse during interrogations, flaws in intelligence 
reports, and harassment of civilians. "That analysis allows us 
to identify problems and recommend solutions to the police and 
Army so no more complaints are filed. The guarantee that our 
observations are heeded is that we do a follow-up every three 
months on the police in specific zones," Echeverri indicated. 
  Among the recommendations suggested by the Attorney 
General's 
Office to the Armed Forces are: not to touch the scenes of 
battles where there are dead or wounded; notify immediately the 
appropriate authorities about the arrest of alleged offenders 
and raids; and allow the control corps to inspect the operations 
log. 
  In the medium-term, the Attorney General's Office is going 
to 
insist that a national statute to conduct intelligence reports 
be drafted. "We cannot continue to conduct military or police 
operations based on rumors. That is why we must establish clear 
guidelines to prepare these kinds of documents," the official 
added. 
  According to Echeverri, the new human rights protection 
program, which has an interinstitutional nature since control 
and security organisms participate in it, entails periodic 
checks. If citizens' complaints of abuses by soldiers go down 
that means the suggestions by said office are being heeded. 
  "To avoid the distortion of the complaints, the Attorney 
General's Office pledges to evaluate and follow up every 
complaint to establish whether or not it is justified," 
designated Human Rights Ombudsman Hernando Valencia Villa said. 
  Echeverri affirmed another of the virtues of this program is 
that permanent, direct, and immediate communications exist 
between the police and Army and control organizations to prevent 
problems. "The Army, for instance, has pledged to keep watchdog 
organizations informed of its operations. If they make an 
arrest or conduct a raid they pledged to report it immediately," 
the deputy attorney general noted. 
  Echeverri and Valencia define this program as "a pact on a 
commitment between the Attorney General's Office and the Armed 
Forces." Another of the virtues of the new monitoring approach, 
according to Echeverri, is that the work by the watchdog 
organisms is decentralized because centralization has proven 
highly flawed. "The idea is to bring all the commands closer in 
a region and establish operations and control guidelines. We 
cannot talk here of an Attorney General's Office syndrome or of 
hampering military operations, but of all of us avoiding future 
problems for the Armed Forces," Echeverri added. 
  The official indicated the program has been so effective 
that 
on the eve of the recent elections the Army, police, and 
Administrative Department of Security conducted a large-scale 
operation in Yopal because of reports the guerrillas were 
preparing a guerrilla offensive from there to hamper the 
elections. "The police," Echeverri noted, "in coordination with 
the Prosecutor General's Office and the Attorney General's 
Office conducted 50 raids, and only one complaint was filed 
involving a minor irregularity in the procedure."

<F P=106> [Interview with Luis Fernando Ramirez, Colombian </F>
Conservative Party vice presidential candidate, by Bibiana 
Mercado; place and date not given; first paragraph is EL TIEMPO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Luis Fernando Ramirez, Andres Pastrana's running 
mate, is today taking enormous steps to recover from the 
distress brought about by his father's kidnapping and 
confronting the ordeals of occupying public office. In an 
interview with EL TIEMPO he explores his political future and 
says that he and Andres are both endowed with the essential 
qualities to beat [Ernesto] Samper and Humberto De la Calle. 
  [EL TIEMPO] There are those who say that your nomination to 
the vice presidency does not add, but on the contrary, could 
represent a setback to Andres Pastrana... 
  [Ramirez] No. We are a young team that represents this 
country's future. The Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is not merely an 
election maneuver that intends to fall back on party principles 
and platforms as has occurred in other cases. What we have here 
is an affinity of opinions; there is a program we both share and 
no fissures. The vice president does not criticize the 
presidential candidate, nor is the vice president to the 
presidential candidate as water is to oil. What takes 
precedence here is both our interest in having a coherent and 
viable platform. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Concretely, you as a technocrat without any 
broad 
grass-root followers, how can you benefit Andres Pastrana? 
  [Ramirez] Success no longer depends on any specific 
traditional politician but on the performance of those officials 
in public service. I believe that Andres Pastrana and I are 
both perceived as persons who do not speak much but execute a 
lot. What we have promised we have honored. That has been a 
constant throughout Andres' career: his word is sacred. That 
has also been my line of conduct. We promised we would carry 
out social security reforms and we did. This law will allow a 
more balanced and fair income distribution. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Yet the reform has been somewhat controversial 
and the law has created dissatisfaction. Don't you believe that 
this could prove to be a disadvantage to Pastrana's campaign? 
  [Ramirez] This is the most substantial social reform that 
has 
taken place in Colombia in the last 50 years. This reform 
guarantees wide-ranging health service coverage. The law 
provides a retirement pension, and provides senior citizens as 
well as the homeless with half of the minimum wage... This is 
something that has never been seen in Colombia. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What specific support will you contribute to 
Andres Pastrana? 
  [Ramirez] It would be worthwhile keeping in mind that I have 
been a public official for the past 14 years, and despite being 
young, I still have more experience than many older persons in 
the government. I have been working shoulder to shoulder since 
1986 with persons such as President Gaviria. I was part of the 
president's economic team and took part in the economic, foreign 
trade, and labor reforms. In other words, we participated in 
those reforms that brought about institutional changes. We took 
part in decisions that benefited the country. 
  We are evidently devoted to progress and willing to bet on 
this country's future. I am a person who likes to work and that 
has been a constant throughout my life. I come from a low 
income household; a son of farmers currently living in Santander 
and from that perspective I represent that department. I am not 
a product of the oligarchy or the aristocracy. 
  [EL TIEMPO] It is being said that your father's kidnapping 
could benefit Andres Pastrana's campaign. What can you say 
about that observation? 
  [Ramirez] The kidnapping and the campaign are two completely 
separate issues. Most naturally, the kidnapping has affected my 
attitude and it is something I will have to overcome. This type 
of experience prompts one to want to make good decisions; the 
ones leading to critical changes that will ensure that it does 
not happen to any other family. The experience does have an 
effect, and it is in terms of earnestly seeking for Colombian 
society to be more egalitarian. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What are the most positive qualities you see in 
your strongest opponent, Humberto De la Calle? 
  [Ramirez] I have the best opinion of Mr. De la Calle and 
agreed with most of the things he said. During the past eight 
months he continuously explained why we should not vote for 
Ernesto Samper. He said that Samper is a populist, and I agreed 
with that. He has indicated that the Samper-De la Calle ticket 
is like water and oil and I agreed with that. Now the country 
can't understand why he suddenly changed his mind and became a 
populist. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What are the most significant differences 
between you and Humberto De la Calle? 
  [Ramirez] We never relinquish our convictions or abdicate 
our 
government programs for the sake of election objectives. The 
Pastrana-Ramirez ticket is a ticket where there is symmetry in 
opinions and no splits. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What do you consider to be the biggest blunder 
of 
the Samper-De la Calle slate? 
  [Ramirez] To believe that an election is simply a matter of 
adding up votes. If they are merely interested in votes, then 
many of them will now lose. The people who were backing Samper 
are now dissatisfied as a result of having handed over their 
platform to De la Calle, and those who supported De la Calle are 
also dissatisfied because of the same reason. 
  [EL TIEMPO] You have suggested a public debate with Humberto 
De la Calle. What would be the primary topic of that debate? 
  [Ramirez] We would do it based on each ticket's government 
platform. Voters want to examine the programs being suggested 
by each candidate, to evaluate which is more convincing and to 
decide on which is more loaded with election promises. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In case of winning, are you prepared to take 
over 
as president if Pastrana is forced to be absent for whatever 
reasons? 
  [Ramirez] I will give you one clue. I have held many 
positions, and I have probably been involved in government 
service more than Mr. De la Calle. Without any doubt I am quite 
prepared to handle the government issues this country needs. I 
have been part of the Executive Branch during the past three 
administrations. I am quite clear on the changes that have been 
taking place during the past decades. I have also worked 
closely with congress. While a minister affiliated with the 
Conservative Party, I led a reform program in a congress 
controlled by the liberals.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] This year began with signs of uncertainty and a 
certain lack of confidence on the part of the country's 
businessmen. 
  Many of them are expecting that sales will show little 
dynamism and that employment and investment will decline. 
However, a majority hope that inflation will continue to 
decline, or will at least stabilize. 
  These expectations were revealed in the results of a survey 
of the private businessmen in various zones of the country 
published in the local journal EKOS. In addition, the report 
notes that these are indications that the economic program of 
the government has reached a key point--one from which it could 
either advance or retreat. 
  The chart shows some of the indicators of the expectations 
of 
the businessmen as determined by the survey published in the 
journal in question. 
  The atmosphere of pessimism among the nation's private 
businessmen with regard to the economic prospects of Ecuador for 
this year, which might mean that the nation has reached a key 
point in its stabilization process, was revealed by the results 
of the survey of 80 executives in the industrial, trade, and 
banking sectors throughout our national territory. 
  While inflation was regarded as the most serious national 
problem until six months ago, economic growth and employment are 
beginning to emerge as the main concerns today. That is what was 
shown by the survey carried out by the journal EKOS, which 
published its first issue a few days ago in Quito under editor 
Pablo Lucio Paredes. He had served previously as the secretary 
of the CONADE [National Council for Development] under the 
current government. 
  None of the businessmen indicated a level of optimism of 
more 
than 50 points, while more than 70 percent of them gave their 
optimism a rating of between 0 and 35 percent. 
  From the survey, one can conclude that 82 percent of the 
businesses plan investment at levels that will increase their 
assets by as much as 10 percent. This figure will merely serve 
to maintain the current level of installed capacity if 
technological and physical depreciation are taken into account. 
  In this connection, the survey shows, 1993 was a better year 
than 1994 will be, although the difference between the two years 
is not a major one, meaning that investments seem "not to have 
awakened from their prolonged lethargy." 
  According to the results of the survey, the textile sector 
represents an exception. After having seen major growth in sales 
in 1993, this sector is planning a recovery in 1994, although 
the year will be characterized by an acceleration in the process 
of reducing personnel and incremental price reductions. A 
similar exception is made where automotive enterprises are 
concerned, as they take an optimistic view of their future. 
  On the other hand, the survey notes, the metal-mechanical 
sector reveals negative growth, a decline in employment, and a 
small increase in prices as a result of competition. 
<H5>  Unemployment Persists </H5>
  In the job sector, the survey warns that 45 percent of those 
questioned plan personnel reductions, and only 16 percent have 
planned to increase the number of employees by more than 5 
percent. 
  In conclusion, stabilization continues to be accompanied by 
dwindling employment, the survey notes. 
  Where the foreign-exchange market is concerned, the survey 
indicates that 25 percent of those surveyed expect the rate to 
rise to more than 2,500 sucres; about 50 percent believe that it 
will reach that level; 30 percent maintain that the dollar will 
not exceed 2,400 sucres; and another third believe it will not 
exceed 2,300 sucres. 
  As to the active interest rates, 72 percent of those 
surveyed 
believe that they will not exceed 40 percent. 
  The weighted average of this indicator in 1993 was 41 
percent, while that anticipated for 1994 is 36 percent. This 
means that there is a clear expectation of a decline in 
financial costs, according to the analysis. 
  The report comments that the movement from stabilization 
toward growth is necessary from the point of view of social 
balance, but it cautions that the tremendous fragility involved 
in the early stages of a process of this nature must be borne in 
mind. More profound modernization and structural reforms are 
recommended.

  [Text] It is not only the illiterate who are the victims of 
unemployment and underemployment. Large groups of professional 
workers, recent graduates, and government employees whose 
resignations have been purchased have been added to the problem. 
  According to the CEPAR [expansion not given], the labor 
supply in the country is growing at an average annual rate of 
2.8 percent. The working age population has increased at a 
percentage higher than that of population growth. As a result, 
it has been predicted that the young economically active 
population (EAP) will increase by 26 percent, while the feminine 
EAP will increase by 31 percent. 
  This situation is of concern to analysts. According to the 
most recent report of the CEPLAES [expansion not given], the 
rate of employment declined 9.1 percent in 1993. 
  The financial difficulties being experienced by businesses 
and the uncertainty they are feeling have aggravated the effects 
of the reduced labor demand. 
  The public and private productive sectors are seeking to 
invest, and thus to provide more stable jobs. The result of this 
process is an increase in unemployment, to which is added the 
decline in the purchasing power of the wage earners. 
  Alberto Acosta warns in an article in the periodical CORREO 
POBLACIONAL of the lack of planning of a political and 
industrial nature that would lead to the creation of jobs. "It 
is hoped that the market, on its own, will generate businesses 
and jobs, but there is no structural policy oriented toward this 
goal." 
  He notes that the lack of reliable information on the 
employment factor is an indication that those responsible for 
economic management regard it as a second-category variable. 
  And on the basic level, there is further symptomatic lack of 
concern about the errors being committed in the training of 
professional workers. The result has been serious difficulty in 
securing job placements. 
  On the basis of these predictions and the current economic 
determinations, it is estimated that it will be necessary to 
absorb an additional labor supply of 981,000 workers in the 
cities and 257,000 in the rural sector in the next 10 years if 
the rates of open unemployment (14.7 percent) and 
underemployment (55 percent) are to be prevented from increasing. 
  These figures show that 124,000 jobs, 79 percent of them in 
the cities, will have to be created every year. 
  The International Labor Organization recommends that the 
increases in social allocations and consumption subsidies be 
reduced, while investments in human capital and training must be 
increased. 
  This organization also regards the establishment of 
subsidies 
to improve nutrition and preventive medical care as necessary. 
  According to the International Labor Organization, the trend 
toward increased unemployment rates, even in the industrialized 
countries, is alarming because of the magnitude of the risk it 
entails. 
  In fact, this factor leads to many consequences, including 
the erosion of national income and the citizens' standard of 
living, thus aggravating the problems of promoting development 
and alleviating poverty. 
  Unemployment also increases the public-budget deficit and 
macroeconomic instability, and it absorbs resources that could 
otherwise be allocated for the purchase of productive equipment, 
education, training, and the provision of aid services to the 
most neglected sectors. 
  Many are of the opinion that the state is no longer the main 
force in the battle against unemployment, poverty, and 
underdevelopment, but rather the basic cause of these problems 
because of the distorting effect of its interventions on the 
market. 
  However, the philosophy oriented toward the market economy 
that gained ground in the decade of the 1980's still has not, in 
practice, produced convincing solutions, at least on a large 
scale. This is evidenced by the job deficit accompanying the 
current economic recovery.

  [Text] It is forest resources (timber) that both the 
private and public sectors who are involved in this activity 
believe might well constitute the most suitable substitute for 
oil, although they do not minimize the potential importance of 
tourism and other productive sectors. 
  The government is apparently aware of this, and this could 
be 
the reason it has been decided to invest between $180 million 
and $200 million in a project designed to reach a level of 
600,000 hectares planted to trees within the next 30 years. If 
this goal is achieved, Ecuador could export timber worth about 
$500 million annually. 
  Exports of sizable volume would begin at the end of about 
five years for balsa wood and about seven years for wood pulp. 
<H5>  Exports Are Increasing </H5>
  Ecuador's exports of timber have seen a gradual increase 
throughout the years, although in 1992 there was a significant 
drop. This trend was reversed in 1993, when the figure almost 
tripled. 
  We see that in 1985, for example, the income obtained from 
timber exports came to $8.798 million, that for 1986 to 
$236,000, that for 1987 to $582,000, and that for 1988 to 
$11.766 million. The figure for 1989 was $12.036 million, that 
for 1990 $11.584 million, that for 1991 $12.158 million, and 
that for 1992 $5.845 million. And finally, by November of 1993, 
the total for the year had reached $14.823 million. 
<H5>  Very Interesting Prospects </H5>
  The prospects for growth in the industrial sector that 
processes timber are very interesting, particularly when such 
major heavy-demand markets as those in Japan, North America, and 
the EEC itself are taken into account. The experts believe that 
in the next century, Japan will become the leading world 
importer of timber, eucalyptus in particular. This is a species 
on which major work is being done in Ecuador with a view to 
improving production and quality. 
  At present the country has about 4 million hectares of 
forests in natural parks, about 6 million hectares of usable 
tropical forest land, about 5 million hectares of unusable 
tropical forest land, and between 60,000 and 70,000 hectares of 
forest plantings. 
<H5>  A Source of Foreign Exchange and Jobs </H5>
  Jorge Barba Gonzalez, the executive director of the 
Ecuadoran 
Forest, Natural Areas, and Sylvan Life Institute (INESAN) 
believes that Ecuador has all of the conditions required in 
order for it to become one of the leading timber-exporting 
countries in the world. 
  He maintains that the situation at present is very clear, 
and 
he says that the existence of a Master Afforestation Plan today, 
the country's first, is the proof. It has been designed to cover 
the next 30 years, and it calls for the afforestation of 600,000 
hectares. 
  This official explains that with 600,000 hectares of forest 
land, Ecuador can earn $500 million annually from the export of 
the products of timber exploitation. This would provide work, 
directly and indirectly, for at least 30,000 individuals. One of 
the goals of the master plan, among others, he says, is to 
safeguard biodiversity. It also calls for an investment total in 
the first few years of about $8 million. The World Bank has 
approved $6.7 million of this sum, and the state will cover the 
difference through the INESAN. 
  Currently, forest resources are generating thousands of jobs 
throughout the country, both directly and indirectly. In all of 
the cities, however small they may be, one can readily see 
sawmills, establishments for the manufacture and sale of chairs, 
beds, other furniture, doors, plywood, etc. 
<H5>  Afforestation Plan Launched </H5>
  This official announced that the INESAN has already 
initiated 
the PLANFOR [Program To Encourage Forest Replanting], through 
which some 240,000 sucres per hectare is being given to the 
farmers or peasants participating in the plan in the mountain 
region, with a slightly larger sum being provided in the coastal 
region. The Forestry Engineers' College is overseeing this 
process, and the funds are being handed over four months after 
the trees are planted. 
  Barba emphasized that there is also a plan for improving the 
nation's forestry resources, in which a Brazilian expert will 
participate. To begin with, eucalyptus and pine will be 
involved. The 11 best species of trees in the country have 
already been chosen, and clones (of eucalyptus) will be 
developed. The same will later be done with other species of 
trees. 
  This official concluded with the statement that the future 
in 
terms of forest resources is undoubtedly encouraging. However, 
he warned that in order to be successful, the Master 
Afforestation Plan must be maintained, and if possible, it 
should be strengthened. 
<H5>  A Substitute for Oil </H5>
  The president of the Ecuadoran Timber Industrialists' 
Association (AIME), Nicanor Fabara, also says that the timber 
sector could provide the best substitute for oil, since Ecuador 
is a prominent afforested country, as foreign experts have noted. 
  We must educate all of the citizens of Ecuador about the 
ecological and economic importance to the country of our 
forestry resources, he stressed. "We executives in the timber 
industry are dedicated to achieving sustainable management of 
the forests, or in other words the cutting of only the trees 
that are absolutely required, while at the same time replanting 
trees and engaging in organized reforestation in order to 
exploit the timber in an organized fashion as well," he added. 
<H5>  Education About Forests Planned </H5>
  Fabara announced that the timber industry sector will go 
forward with a plan called "Forest Culture." It will involve a 
campaign to develop a national understanding of afforestation as 
a measure that is indispensable not only for ecological 
development, but for good business as well, although its fruits 
will not be seen immediately, but only after a number of years. 
  This campaign will be pursued in all of the media, and some 
will participate as promoters. Millions will be invested in this 
effort. The financing will basically come from the resources of 
the AIME (in the initial phase) and foreign funds, as well as 
from entities like the San Francisco University. 
  The timber-processing industry is aware that forest 
resources 
have been exploited without any planning, Fabara said. In 
conclusion, he indicated that the important thing is that there 
is time to correct this, and in order to do so, we must raise 
the consciousness of the citizens of Ecuador. We must begin by 
teaching children the importance of planting trees, and teaching 
the farmers and settlers to make rational and proper use of this 
resource, since 70 percent of the timber being cut is being 
wasted due to ignorance and failure to protect the wood.

<F P=106> [Article by Noemi Ulloa: "Investment for Life"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Instead of "a loaf of bread under his arm," each 
child born in Ecuador now bears the burden of more than $1,000 
(2 million sucres) in foreign debt. 
  Perhaps for this reason, among many others, the citizens of 
Ecuador today want fewer children than was the case in the past. 
The decline in population growth from 3.1 percent in 1974 to 2.1 
percent per year in 1992 is the most important change in the 
demographic development of the country. 
  About 300,000 children are born in Ecuador every year, and 
approximately 15,000 die before they reach the age of one year. 
  Both the mortality rate and the birthrate have been 
gradually 
declining for about 10 years. According to the figures of the 
National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), the 
birthrate is 18.2 per thousand inhabitants on the national level. 
  Ecuador is among the countries with average birthrates, 
although it continues to have a high rate of infant mortality, 
at 37.9 per thousand live births. 
  According to Plutarco Naranjo, the former minister of 
health, 
respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are the leading 
causes of infant deaths, followed by diarrhea, infectious 
diseases, and parasitic diseases. 
  Naranjo expressed regret that there is no serious long-term 
plan in the country to begin as of now to resolve the major 
problems of infancy. 
  He expressed the view that under the present circumstances 
in 
Ecuador, there is neither enough time being devoted, nor enough 
other resources such as experience, capability, and adequate 
projections for the future being allocated, to be able to plan 
for the future over the long run. 
  But not everything is gloomy. The successes achieved in 
Ecuador in the realm of education place it in a vanguard 
position among the Andean nations. 
  The illiteracy rate (10 percent) is the lowest in this 
subregion, and public expenditure on education as a segment of 
the gross domestic product (GDP) (3.5 percent) ranks second only 
to the figure for Venezuela. 
  To this progress one must add the approval of the new 
Minors' 
Code, which introduces the concept developed in the Convention 
on the Rights of Children that imposes greater responsibility 
for children on society and the family. 
  Despite the advances made, the children in Ecuador will 
enter 
the 21st century at high risk in terms of mortality and 
malnutrition. The basic reasons for this situation are the level 
of poverty in which their mothers are living and the 
unsatisfactory quality and quantity of the health, environmental 
protection, and educational services being offered. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Martini] </F>
  [Text] Some blunders like appointing Bacon Duarte Prado as 
an adviser or avoiding the implementation of serious measures at 
the IPS [Social Security Institute] are factors that reduce the 
credibility of the executive branch's political management. If 
we add to this Decree No. 2780 on promotions and transfers in 
the judicial branch, the lack of enthusiasm with which [Colorado 
Party Deputy] Bernardino Cano Redil -- the government's main 
intellectual operator -- champions some government positions, 
and the Colorado Party's sensible silence last month, we 
recognize an increasingly isolated president at Lopez Palace. 
Even [Colorado Party Senator] Juan Carlos Galaverna seemed out 
of place this week. 
  It is not possible to ask the government to solve in less 
than one year of administration the problems of the oligarchic 
agrarian structure bequeathed by numerous decades of wealth 
concentration. It is also not possible to ask the government to 
work a miraculous economic swap that will allow a large GDP 
growth rate. It is not possible to ask the government to affect 
the international prices for soybean or cotton, and, with the 
assistance of a saint, conclude the military's reform within 
eight months. It is not possible to ask the government to 
abruptly improve the quality and scope of education. No one is 
asking Engineer Wasmosy to perform these miracles. 
  The problem is that there are not even favorable signs of a 
political line allowing us to guess that we have a government 
management that seeks to overcome these and other serious social 
and economic deficits. The Social Development Council 
represents an attempt to find a solution to the growing social 
crisis. And, as a general framework, we must mention a policy 
of basic agreements sought through discussions among various 
parties or directly through agreements on concrete issues. And 
the "democratic compromise" is a sign of the latter method. 
  Bearing in mind the new political arena, involving an 
increased balance of forces, a broad conciliatory policy has 
been sought. And even though the National Encounter, the 
[Colorado Party leader Luis] Argana supporters, and the [Hermes 
and Miguel] Saguier supporters uphold a critical stance toward 
[opposition leader] Domingo Laino, they are actually 
implementing a moderate opposition and have signed the 
"democratic compromise." In a nutshell, President Wasmosy has a 
potentially favorable arena to achieve a broad spectrum of basic 
agreements that might represent a contribution to the 
credibility of President Wasmosy's government. Nevertheless, for 
reasons that we cannot entirely understand, the president 
sometimes seems to be his government's main opponent. The last 
measure taken on the judicial issue violates the spirit and 
letter of the "democratic compromise." In addition, the 
president has not taken drastic measures on the IPS issue or 
agrarian problems. It seems to be a government that does not 
take any initiatives. 
<H5>  Wasmosy's Men </H5>
  The selection of his advisers reflects a president's 
political bias. It is hard to believe that a figure like Duarte 
Prado can contribute anything to the government's democratic 
credibility. It is also not possible to trust in Engineer 
Wasmosy's effective willingness to advance with all the 
democratic segments in the improvement of justice with actions 
like those taken this week. 
  Therefore, the question of who are the men governing with 
Wasmosy arises. We assume that they are not the main 
shareholders and directors of the companies that allowed him to 
accumulate wealth recently. We trust [Army Commander Division] 
General [Lino] Oviedo is not one of them. The Colorado Party 
leadership does not have a clear position on the social 
problems. And since the ANR [National Republican Association -- 
Colorado Party] already is involved in its primary campaign, 
some of its main leaders are reviving their traditional 
language, with the exception of Education Minister Nicanor 
Duarte Frutos. 
  The UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] is withdrawing its 
support. The trade unions are calling a general strike. The 
president should -- at least -- attempt to keep fluent 
communications with his moderate opposition. And he does not do 
it. Therefore, who is or are advising him? What is the 
president's political strategy team? It is worrisome. We still 
believe that the first civilian president since 1954 must be 
successful. And that he is still in time to change the course.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Alberto Fujimori by unidentified </F>
correspondent "in Santiago, during the Chilean presidential 
inauguration"] 
  [Text] [ESTRATEGIA] You have said you favor signing a 
complementary economic agreement with Chile. Will your 
government promote the appropriate negotiations? 
  [Fujimori] I believe in the future of integration. We must 
take concrete steps and not merely deliver speeches because this 
time is over. There is rapprochement with Chile in every field, 
and so it would also be a good step. We are ready. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In what areas are Chile and Peru complementary? 
  [Fujimori] We must study the details, but I believe trade 
relations could grow enormously, for example, in the 
agro-industrial and mining-metallurgical areas. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Will bilateral border problems influence the 
political decision of promoting an agreement with Chile? 
  [Fujimori] Not at all. We must overcome all these relics. 
We require a bit more communication and dialogue before we can 
overcome the inactivity and the arms race which caused so much 
damage. As I said at the Rio de Janeiro summit, Peru has taken 
concrete steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust and we 
have removed entire battalions from the Chilean border. I do 
not believe border problems will prevent development between the 
two countries. The trauma is being overcome. In high schools, 
a lot was taught about Tarapaca, but now Arica is being 
mentioned. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Will Peru seek entry into NAFTA? 
  [Fujimori] Yes, we are preparing for that. Compared with 
other Latin American countries, our economy is quite open 
because we have made huge progress. During the past two years, 
our industries have been transforming at a speed never seen 
before. We believe we will soon be ready to join and be fully 
competitive with large blocs. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Does your administration favor joining large 
trade blocs like the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]? 
  [Fujimori] Unfortunately, there are various degrees of 
progress in the economic field. Despite various years of 
backwardness, I believe Peru has achieved rapid advancement in 
the past two years. We have removed all subsidies. We have 
imposed a 15 percent tariff and our economy is totally open. We 
have surpassed some Andean Pact members and thus had to cancel 
our participation temporarily. We have achieved bilateral 
agreements with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, and we also hope 
to achieve one with Chile. I first want to consider Latin 
America as a group, like Mercosur, and then join NAFTA. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Chilean entrepreneurs have complained of some 
problems in investing in Peru, specifically in the private 
pensions area. What progress has been made to solve these 
problems? 
  [Fujimori] We have profited from the Chilean experience and 
have removed negative features. Nevertheless, there are some 
differences involving the Peruvian AFP's [Pension Fund Managing 
Companies] that we have been attempting to correct. One is the 
difference between the percentage contributed by the state 
social security and the percentage contributed by the AFP. The 
difference involves about 7 percent of salaries. We are 
studying this issue so that the AFP and the State Social 
Security will be on the same level. It is obviously more 
advantageous for a company whose workers are contributing to the 
state social security to have them under such a state system 
because its cost is 7 percent less. Nevertheless, I believe 
there are ways to correct this situation. 
  There has been a delay in the entry of state workers into 
the 
AFP system. This has been overcome through a legal mechanism 
and the reentry of state workers into the AFP has already been 
allowed with the employer-state contributions delayed until May. 
This situation, however, will not represent a problem for the 
AFP. 
  There is another problem involving the jurisdiction of the 
AFP. The problem involves its investments, which will be 
overcome through the issuance of Treasury bonds. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What is the current situation of labor unions 
in Peru? 
  [Fujimori] They are certainly relevant, and we give them the 
importance they deserve. The labor movement is currently 
non-politicized. Most workers do not accept a political 
affiliation. Of course there are movements that demand better 
labor and salary conditions, but they do not maintain a 
political stance. I can assure you we have a labor law that 
guarantees investments and labor movement will not be 
obstructive. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Given a strong inflow of money as a result of 
the privatizations, you have said your government will 
reconsider its economic management but without changing the 
current program. What changes will be made? 
  [Fujimori] Our economic program has certain macroeconomic 
goals in the field of inflation, monetary expansion, and growth. 
We foresaw an income of about $1 billion from the 
privatizations, part of which would go to the national budget. 
But the situation has changed suddenly and we will obtain more 
than $3 billion. This probably means long- and medium-term 
investments could be financed with funds from the Treasury 
without resorting to costly bank loans. This is small change we 
are introducing into the economic program. 
  But the rules of the game remain the same; we are 
considering 
ways to inject this inflow of dollars into our economy. One way 
is through medium- and long-term investments in hydroelectric 
plants or paved highways. We will seek investments with a 
greater proportion of imported components because we do not want 
a monetary mass that can exert inflationary pressures. We have 
enough reserves as result of all these privatizations. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Privatizations have been your main economic 
accomplishment, but some criticize that they were carried out 
too slowly and that sale prices were below the real value of the 
assets. 
  [Fujimori] It is interesting that the government was right 
when it established an agenda of privatizations. We were not 
willing to privatize at the speed some economists demand because 
we did not know the real value of our public companies. The 
prices of our public companies are increasing so we will sell 
them at the appropriate moment. I am sure that a year ago we 
would have not obtained the price that was finally paid for CPT 
[Peruvian Telephone Company] and Entel [National 
Telecommunications Enterprise]. We also have companies for 
which no one would have paid anything, like Centromin-Peru 
[Central Peru Mining Enterprise]. Several important groups now 
want to buy it. I can tell you more: a cement factory, for 
example, whose base price was $30 million was finally sold for 
$67 million. Our public companies now have a real value, there 
is interest, security, guarantees, and a legal framework to 
guarantee investments. Above everything, there is an atmosphere 
of total internal security. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What economic results do you expect for 1994? 
  [Fujimori] We have established two important parameters: 
Annual inflation will not be greater than 25 percent and 
economic growth will be greater than 5 percent; we also expect 
social investments to be 40 or 50 percent greater than in 1993, 
that is, about $800 million. Economic growth was 7 percent last 
year, the greatest in the American continent, and inflation was 
below 40 percent. We almost complied with our goal which was 
something like 35 percent. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What other problems is the Peruvian economy 
confronting? 
  [Fujimori] I believe we have overcome most of our problems, 
although we are, certainly, still at a recessionary level, 
because of the dollar being underrated -- not because of 
economic problems, but because of drug trafficking -- and 
because of the relatively high interest rates. We want to 
uproot those problems. Concerning the exchange rate, we are 
doing more efficient work, concentrating in antinarcotics 
actions all the efforts that were previously made in the 
antiterrorist fight. We hope to significantly stem the flow of 
narcodollars. Some $1 billion might be currently entering Peru, 
and this is far too much to be absorbed. 
  Concerning interest rates, we hope privatization of 
Interbanc 
and Continental Bank -- two sound enterprises -- will make 
interest rates drop. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What reforms do you expect to implement to 
modernize the economy even further? 
  [Fujimori] Over the next few months there will be no major 
measures. We will promote farming with measures aiming at 
stabilizing farm product prices. This entails the adoption of 
flexible tariffs, so that Peruvian food products like wheat, 
rice, corn, and milk -- which are also the main imported food 
items -- remain stable. We want farmers to capitalize. At the 
same time, we will take care of pacification. Even though it is 
true that no liberal policy has yet been enforced for the 
agricultural area, we hope to design one in 1996. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] In a hypothetical case, if you do not run for 
reelection, don't you think the economic program might be 
endangered? 
  [Fujimori] (Smiles.) It would be difficult to go backward 
after the progress we have made. Even though there are always 
risks, all social sectors support the government policy -- 
especially the economic policy. The entire reform program that 
we enforced over a record period has had massive support in the 
poorer zones of the country. What the government should now do 
is enforce a social program to end poverty, in order to 
consolidate all the reforms. This will then guarantee that 
people will not choose a president who will bring retrogression. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Some analysts believe that your country is very 
well, but they wonder: What will come after Fujimori? 
  [Fujimori] The best guarantee is the position of the 
Peruvian 
people, who will not agree to retrogression or to a populist or 
paternalistic policy in the style of previous administrations. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] But if we consider the results of the previous 
plebiscite, in which the government position won by a small 
margin... 
  [Fujimori] There were distorting factors that did not 
reflect 
the support for the government work. For example, on the death 
penalty there were negative votes, even if voters were 
government supporters, or because there was a campaign that 
distorted some concepts, and this reduced the difference of 
votes. Yet all polls reveal a majority support, an average of 
two-thirds, for the president's work, despite the fact that very 
drastic measures have been enforced. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Are you going to run in next year's 
presidential elections? 
  [Fujimori] I have not made up my mind yet, even though the 
Constitution and the people have called on me to do so. I 
should make a decision at the beginning of October. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] Could you name your political heirs? 
  [Fujimori] I would rather not talk about heirs, but it is 
possible to see a wide range of candidates on the political 
scene, even though they are not yet fully consolidated. In all 
likelihood the names of some candidates will be known in the 
forthcoming months. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] There are those who have been mentioning the 
name of one of your sons... 
  [Fujimori] (He breaks into a hearty laugh) For 2015; Kenji, 
who is 14 years old, accompanies me on all my trips to the 
interior and abroad. Some caricatures of him were done at one 
time, calling him the deputy foreign minister. A public opinion 
poll conducted by Apoyo among 1,000 entrepreneurs showed that 
Kenji ranks seventh as the most influential person in the 
country, followed by the chairman of the Council of Ministers. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What are the advantages and drawbacks of your 
administration? 
  [Fujimori] There are no drawbacks. The advantages are that I 
have party values. There is a leadership, a clear direction; 
there is no tug of war between political parties. We can thus 
pursue our political, social, and economic policy without 
encountering major setbacks. There is no such thing as the 
typical attacks made by politicians. We can tackle problems 
rationally, objectively, and in a strictly technical way. This 
leads to better results, because political considerations do not 
always prevail over technical ones. The nonexistence of a party 
structure, therefore, expedites the decisionmaking process. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] What laws that have not been enacted would you 
have liked Congress to pass? 
  [Fujimori] With regard to the previous Congress, the 
economic 
reform would not have prospered, because if it was not Congress, 
it was the judiciary that kept changing it; or else, the 
Constitutional Court did it. There is still much to be done at 
Congress -- articles, laws, legal principles must be reviewed. 
  [ESTRATEGIA] To conclude, what message would you like to 
send 
to Chilean investors? 
  [Fujimori] Peru is a country with a future. It can be one of 
the superstars in the next years. There are good guarantees for 
making business; we have great natural resources, a growing 
market that is unexplored. I think that it has enormous 
possibilities. I would like to tell Chilean companies that our 
government policy is at present trying to enhance productivity 
conditions by improving infrastructure. My message is that they 
become acquainted with our reality, that they embark on new 
business ventures in Peru, including investments and tourism. 
This is not just my personal opinion; it is a fact.

  [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Bomb attacks were carried out 
here today against a bank and a Peruvian Telephone Company (CPT) 
office in the wake of an unsuccessful attempt to cause a 
blackout in the Peruvian capital. This new, weak terrorist act 
caused only damage. 
  The attacks caused heavy damage, which has yet to be 
assessed, to a Credit Bank office in the Victoria district and 
to the CPT office located in the San Luis district. 
  Several blasts, which were initially believed to be bombs, 
were also heard simultaneously in several points of the city. 
These blasts, however, turned out to be dynamite sticks that 
went off in the air. 
  Shortly before the attacks, there was a power surge 
apparently caused by an unsuccessful attempt to sabotage the 
power transmission line that supplies Lima. 
  Terrorist attacks have declined markedly since Shining Path 
leader Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992 and have declined 
further since Guzman admitted his defeat and sought to negotiate 
with the government in September 1993.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Mar (EFE) -- According to a report 
published today by the news magazine "SEMANA ECONOMICA," 
Industry, Commerce, Tourism, and Integration Minister Liliana 
Canale will announce in Caracas next week that Peru is to rejoin 
the Andean Group. 
  In August 1992 Peru temporarily relinquished -- first until 
31 December 1993, and then until 30 April 1994 -- the economic 
obligations it had under the external common tariffs agreement 
and the Andean liberalization program. 
  Canale will apparently submit on 4 and 5 April in Caracas -- 
during the next meeting of the Commission, which is the Andean 
Pact's top organ -- a proposal for a transition program with a 
single 15 percent tariff that will be reduced gradually. 
  The Andean Group currently has four types of tariffs -- of 
5, 
10, 15, and 20 percent -- but they are not yet in force because 
the tariff levels for some products have not yet been 
established. 
  According to the Peruvian magazine, Peru cannot return to 
the 
Andean Pact all of a sudden, "because this might affect the 
enterprises of the sectors in which distortions remain in the 
other Andean Pact countries," which are Bolivia, Ecuador, 
Colombia, and Venezuela. 
  Peruvian Exporters Association (ADEX) representative Eduardo 
Irigoyen, a member of the Metal Mechanical Committee, has said 
that it is essential to return to the Andean Group because his 
sector and the chemical, lumber, and fishing sectors have great 
comparative advantages with respect to the other Andean Group 
nations.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, </F>
leader of the 200 Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, by Carlos 
Fernandez, in Caracas; date not given; from the "24 Hours" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Fernandez] Listeners of the 24 Hours program: We 
are here with Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez Frias. There is no 
need for preambles or introductions. We wish to thank Lt. Col. 
Chavez for this exclusive interview with the 24 Hours program. 
  My first question is: What have you learned as a result of 
the 4 February and 27 November movements? 
  [Chavez] Thank you, Carlos. We thank you for inviting us 
here and allowing us to continue in our effort to contact the 
Venezuelan and Latin American people. The media play a very 
important role in this. 
  What did we learn? Let us talk about priorities. Now that I 
am here, now that I have seen the people gathered outside the 
Athenaeum -- this is something that truly encourages a person to 
strive to further identify oneself with Venezuela -- I would say 
that this is the most important thing I have learned. I told my 
fellow countrymen who have gathered out there that there are 
people who stood up, flag in hand, for their dream of a nation 
in the future. I believe that is the most important thing I have 
learned about this historic time in which we are living. 
  [Fernandez] Do you believe all of them know what you fought 
for during the 4 February and 27 November movements? It is 
said, and very few will deny this, that after the 4 February and 
27 November movements an important change occurred within the 
democratic structure of our country. However, I seem to sense 
that Hugo Chavez Frias has his doubts. What does Hugo Chavez 
think? What will he do? 
  [Chavez] I do not believe the traditional Venezuelan 
politician understands what has happened in Venezuela since 4 
February 1992. We see this in the National Congress. It 
continues to be a redoubt for groups and the party inner circles 
who reach agreements behind the backs of the people and against 
the interests and hopes of the people. 
  [Fernandez] However, you have seen that important changes 
did 
take place after 4 February. The historic sum is tremendous. 
In some way the Venezuelan democratic structure was moved. I 
would say that the results we saw on 5 December 1993 are, in 
some way, the result of something that began with the 4 February 
movement and ended with the 27 November movement. 
  [Chavez] There have been some changes. I must admit that 
there have been some changes in the country. However, as I said 
earlier, Carlos, and I reiterate it to all the Venezuelan people 
who are watching at this moment, the changes are only 
superficial. The Venezuelan crisis is so deep that it calls for 
deep solutions. We must go very deep to find solutions. The 
economic structures and the political structures remain 
unchanged. They were shaken, they were cracked, but they are 
still there. I believe that one of the biggest responsibilities 
the new sectors have is to continue digging the graves for those 
structures. They must be crushed and new economic and social 
structures built if we want to see real changes. If the 
structures are not changed, then there can be no real change in 
the situation. We must not let ourselves be fooled, fellow 
country. 
  [Fernandez] Do you know how strong you are? Are you aware of 
your political responsibility? 
  [Chavez] We are trying to gauge this. 
  [Fernandez] It is not easy. 
  [Chavez] No, no, no, this is not easy. Remember that.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] You are very strong. 
  [Chavez] Yes Carlos, and it truly commits us. I wish you 
could have visited us while we were in jail so that we could 
have talked to the people. After more than two years in jail, 
after our shaken nation experienced four governments, we are now 
seeing the faces of the children and the people. We can now see 
what is happening. We can talk to you freely, and we can listen 
to the people and tell them about our ideas. Now is when we are 
truly beginning to gauge the results of our actions in every 
sense. 
  [Fernandez] You have said that the political factors remain 
unchanged. However, since 5 December there has been a 
readjustment of forces within the National Congress, as well as 
a readjustment of the people's awareness. This is very 
important. This is why I insist on asking whether you are sure 
of the path you are undertaking. Are you sure of the ground you 
are stepping on? Are you aware of the obstacles, barriers, and 
enemies you are confronting? 
  [Chavez] Let us say that we are not totally clear on that 
because there is a terrible, tremendous darkness surrounding us. 
Since you have insisted, I will tell you that I do not believe 
important changes have occurred in the composition of the 
political forces. Some progress has been made among the 
so-called different sectors, but, for example, what kind of 
decisions has the National Congress made in these past two 
months? What decisions has it made to show us that it wants to 
change the current situation? What we are seeing are things that 
did not exist before. We are seeing assemblies during which the 
party inner circles reach agreements to remove governors. We 
are headed for national anarchy; this is even more worrisome. 
  [Fernandez] There are those who say that Caldera's victory 
rides on the 4 February and 27 November movements and that the 
readjustment of forces seen within the National Congress and the 
support the Radical Cause Party got during the elections also 
ride on these movements. What do you think of that? 
  [Chavez] That is a good description of the changes, but the 
changes are still superficial. However, we have to admit that 
changes have been made and that the people's awareness has also 
changed. The people are aware that we are in a labyrinth and 
that we must find a way out. A sector, a minority sector, tried 
to do this, but just look at what a fraud the elections were. 
They were a mortal blow to the people's hopes of finding 
solutions along that path. 
  [Fernandez] [Words indistinct] a big fraud? 
  [Chavez] Yes, they were. We still have a Supreme Electoral 
Council in the hands of the traditional parties, from the 
highest office to the lowliest organization in the most distant 
municipality. If the system and the leaders do not understand 
that this must be changed, then social unrest will continue in 
the country. I hope this will not occur. 
  [Fernandez] Why not? Because of the violence? 
  [Chavez] Not necessarily. I will only say I hope this will 
not occur. We have been sending out a message and I wish to 
repeat it. We believe that one of the few ways to attain peace 
is a Constituent Assembly, not one handled by the political 
parties. Please. It should not be a Constituent Assembly 
handled by the traditional parties, but one handled by people 
outside the framework of political parties and the traditional 
sectors. 
  [Fernandez] Do you not feel that political tension in our 
country has somewhat lessened following the 5 December 
elections? Do you not believe there is more trust among the 
people and that the people have placed their hopes on the new 
government? 
  [Chavez] Listen: Generally, when a government begins there 
are many hopes, regardless of its legitimacy or the number of 
votes received. The legitimacy of the current government is 
there, but it is very low. This must be recognized; we must not 
deceive ourselves. Regardless of the government's legitimacy or 
political support, normally when a government begins the people 
have a great deal of expectation. 
  Carlos, five years ago I was working at Miraflores Palace 
when Perez came to power. I did not serve in the military 
detachment there but as an aide for the Defense and Security 
Secretariat. I witnessed the people's joy when Perez won in 
Caracas. I remember that a truck packed with Perez supporters 
crashed into the gate of Miraflores Palace and there was a 
serious problem. I was there that evening. In other words, 
there was a great deal of expectation over Perez' victory, but 
look at what happened in less than a month. All the 
expectations collapsed. 
  [Fernandez] Do you not think Perez' proposal was perhaps 
deceiving? 
proposed to break with the IMF, and a month later, in the most 
hypocritical and shameless manner, an agreement with the IMF was 
announced that established fuel increases, etc. We all know 
that story. 
  [Fernandez] Now, on the position that you are going to 
assume as a political movement with Caldera's government: How 
are you going to organize yourselves. What is your opinion of 
Caldera's government? Do you believe that the first steps being 
taken could serve as a point of reference to attempt to correct 
the nation's crisis? 
  [Chavez] It may be possible for Caldera's government to take 
an important step toward a road for significant changes. Up 
until now I personally have not seen any strong decision to lead 
the nation on that road. Nevertheless, look here, the 
president.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] He did not even have an economic 
plan set out.... 
  [Chavez, interrupting] I was just going to make reference to 
precisely that. All of us know about the Sosa Plan, but there 
is no strategic plan to recover the nation from this dramatic 
economic situation. A plan is fundamental to being able to 
recover from and end this [word indistinct] chaos. To sum it up, 
it will depend on the Caldera government's political actions. I 
must say it; I must confess it; I am concerned, because up until 
now we have not seen this. We have not perceived this in a 
little over a month -- which is a short but decisive time. 
Remember the 100-day factor. [words indistinct] 
  [Fernandez] These [first 100 days] are crucial for a 
government's development. 
  [Chavez] I think that is true, because after that time the 
government loses some of its motivation, the people's support, 
and initiative. It then falls into inactivity. In my opinion, 
Caldera's government has remained in a state of exasperating 
inertia. I invite the government to leave behind that state of 
inertia. 
  [Fernandez] An important initiative has been presented by a 
[word indistinct] political party which is the Special Powers 
Law that could serve as a support. This could be political 
parliamentary support for the government to start making 
decisions. Commander Chavez, do you think that this Special 
Powers Law could be used to take emergency or special measures 
in the financial and economic sectors? 
  [Chavez] This could be, but no one can guarantee that the 
Special Powers Law will assure that the most appropriate 
measures will be taken. 
  We must recall that a Special Powers Law was available to 
Carlos Andres Perez, and all he did with it was cut off all of 
Venezuela's chances -- despite all the resources available to 
him -- to be led into a true national project. Subsequently, 
what was implemented was the Great Venezuela plan, which led us 
to the most tragic chapter in Venezuelan history. 
  [Fernandez] Commander Chavez, I would like to talk about the 
ideological inspiration of the Bolivarian movement. Obviously, 
great national inspiration permeates from the thoughts of 
Bolivar and other heroes, but is there, in any way, an 
international inspiration to the Bolivarian movement? 
  [Chavez] Well....[pauses] 
  [Fernandez] I am asking you this because at some time, 
around 
4 February, a series of speculations and conjectures arose. 
Namely, Bolivar was compared to Argentina's Painted Faces and 
other military movements all over Latin America. You did 
respond to those speculations, but there are some who still 
believe that there is somewhat of an international inspiration 
involved. 
  [Chavez] Yes, unavoidably, there are people who believe and 
will continue to believe that. We have been linked to extreme 
rightist sectors -- that is where I believe the Argentine 
Painted Faces came up -- and we have also been linked with 
extreme leftist sectors such as the [words indistinct], the 
Third Path, and Cuba's Castroism. In other words, this 
association depends on who is making the associations, their 
ideologies, and the interests involved in establishing links 
between us and other movements. We have talked about the 
reemergence of an ideology, which indeed has international 
undertones, or, as I prefer to say, it has international 
repercussions. At this moment, I believe that the ideological 
weight represented by the Mayan Indians in Mexico.... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] [Words indistinct] of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army? 
  [Chavez] That is right. There is a relation there that we 
would have to take apart carefully and analyze with documents 
regarding the proclamations and the demands behind the discourse 
of the Zapatists. However, my instinct tells me that an 
ideological connection exists there, without the existence of a 
previous agreement. 
  Now, I want to reiterate the essence of our national 
project. 
Currently, what we have is a national [word indistinct] 
Bolivar-Zamora-Rodriguez. This is not about us putting a 
hundred -- just to give a figure -- national heroes in a box and 
deciding to pick three out of it. No, no, no. We in the Army 
conducted a study on the political, social, and pedagogical 
ideas of these three Venezuelan heroes. Simon Rodriguez 
represented an original path for Latin America. Rodriguez urged 
Venezuelans and Latin Americans to finish the political 
revolution Bolivar started with, for instance, an economic 
revolution. He had designed a thorough plan for popular 
education, which conveyed the idea that Latin America must 
follow original models, plans, and governments. Back in 1842, 
Rodriguez warned Latin Americans to avoid deceptions and argued 
that there were no republics in America because there were no 
peoples, and the former could not exist without the latter. 
This shows the ideological weight that existed back then. 
Bolivar called Rodriguez the Socrates from Caracas. Rodriguez 
joined forces with Bolivar, who presented two constitutional 
drafts and proposed the idea of a moral and electoral power. It 
was also Bolivar that claimed that the people were sovereign and 
ordered the military to take up their swords to defend social 
guarantees. He was the one who joined Rodriguez, his mentor, and 
Ezequiel Zamora, the general of the sovereign people who 
instilled a high social content in the Bolivarian project. 
  [Fernandez] Is that what marks the difference between the 
Bolivarian movement and the remainder of the political 
organizations of our country? 
  [Chavez] I believe that is one of the basic factors that 
makes it different. Why? Because I believe none of the 
political organizations in Venezuela have a clear ideological 
banner. If you make a distinction between Democratic Action and 
COPEI [Social Action Party].... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] Could we then say that you had 
some 
international inspiration in the socialist movement, in the 
Bolshevik movement of the early century? In other words, we 
could then look back into all of that and reach some conclusion 
to that effect. Could we also point out that the Bolivarian 
movement will be an autochthonous movement in the political 
movement from now on? 
  [Chavez] Yes, I believe it is autochthonous. Nonetheless, 
through reading, experience [two-second break in transmission] 
premilitary if you wish, in military youth, in contacts with 
other countries, we could say it is seeking, it is attaining 
ideological impact from an individual point of view. However, as 
a group our creation in the National Army now offers the country 
and -- why not -- Latin America an autochthonous ideological 
project. 
  [Fernandez] Friends, that was an interview with Commander 
Hugo Chavez Frias. We thank Commander Chavez Frias for allowing 
us this interview, this contact, this exclusive dialogue for "24 
Hours."

  [Excerpt] Paramaribo -- During the recapture of the Afobaka 
Dam, the Surinamese Army deliberately gave all the rebels from 
the Suriname Liberation Front (SLF) the chance to flee. Nobody 
from the SLF was killed or wounded by the Army, said A. Bappa, 
one of the rebels involved in the occupation of the dam and the 
hostage-taking of 30 employees from the bauxite company Suralco. 
  This statement directly contradicts the Army's official 
statement, which said that five rebels were killed while fleeing 
during the recapture mission. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Rafael Medina and Roberto Melendez] </F>
  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 27 Mar -- Maria del 
Socorro Lopez, Jesus Romero Magana, and Ali Reibel Arista 
Chavez, officials of the Federal Attorney General's Office, have 
been able to determine from the investigation they are 
conducting the motive behind the assassination of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio [Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, presidential 
candidate], that Mario Aburto Martinez belongs to the Cardenist 
Front for National Reconstruction Party [PFCRN], and that he 
traveled to Chiapas in early January. This is according to 
statements made by the alleged assassin's girlfriend, Graciela 
Gonzalez Diaz, age 16. 
  Meanwhile, in another booth on the third floor of the 
Attorney General's Office [PGR] in this city, another detainee 
had to testify after being fingered as the "heavy man," who 
opened up room in the crowd for Mario Aburto Martinez to fire 
his gun only a few centimeters from Colosio's head. According to 
our correspondents, his name is Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, 
allegedly hired -- among many others -- by the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party to protect the candidate during the rally 
held at Lomas Taurinas neighborhood. 
  In giving further details to a representative of the Federal 
Attorney General's Office and without being pressured, Graciela 
Gonzalaz Diaz, who was accompanied by her uncle, Isidoro 
Gonzalez Reyes, said that Mario Aburto had proudly told her that 
he belonged to the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], 
that he had been appointed "eagle knight," and that he had been 
given a special mission. Martinez, who was also her fellow 
worker, however, had never revealed the mission to her. 
Likewise, according to the documents drafted in triplicate 
containing the statements made by Graciela Gonzalez Diaz, she 
explained that Mario Aburto was very reserved about the 
activities he carried out within his party, and "to show off" he 
told her that he had traveled to Chiapas during the uprising. 
Gonzalez Diaz said: "He told me he had traveled to Chiapas on 
previous occasions." 
  After Sanchez Venegas was fully identified, the authorities 
played a videocassette which clearly shows how he opened up room 
for Mario Aburto Martinez so that he could shoot at the 
politician from Sonora State. Likewise, in photographs of the 
same rally prior to the attack, it can be seen that Sanchez 
Venegas never took his eyes off Mario Aburto, who was only a few 
meters away. 
  Based on photos and the videocassette, federal prosecutors 
asked Aburto Martinez's alleged collaborator about this 
participation, but, rejecting all charges despite the evidence, 
he just kept saying, "it is all a coincidence." The 
videocassette shows how, after the PRI candidate appeared, 
Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas draws near and pushes General Domiro 
Roberto Garcia Reyes to one side of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
enabling Aburto to approach the candidate from the right side 
and shoot him. He is also observed to step back when the shot 
is fired. He then disappears. 
  The agents investigating the case have yet to determine who 
passed himself off as Aburto at Aburto's place of employment on 
the day of the attack. According to Gonzalez Diaz, this person 
drove a late model blue sports car with white license plates 
from the border area of the state. The place where Aburto spent 
the night prior to the attack has not been determined. He did 
not stay with his mother, Maria Luisa Martinez Pinones, at No. 
20150 Santa Rosalia Street, Block No. 54, Lot 7, Buenos Aires 
Sur neighborhood; or with his aunt at No. 20842 Mexicali Street, 
also in the Buenos Aires neighborhood. Neighbors of Aburto's 
mother, who refused to give their names, told reporters that he 
only visited his mother on rare occasions and that sometimes 
they "argued" loudly about money. Aburto's mother lives with her 
two daughters, Karina and Elizabeth. To earn extra money, they 
rent a room to two youths from Michoacan who were also arrested 
for questioning, but who were later released. Maria Luisa lives 
in a black two-story cement and brick building. A plastic Santa 
Claus face hangs from one of the windows on the second floor. 
  Adrian Carrera, director of the Federal Judicial Police, and 
Juan Alberto Carbajal, director of preliminary investigations, 
arrived in this city last night apparently to widen their 
investigations. Carbajal returned to Mexico City at 0700 today 
aboard a special PGR flight. Sanchez Venegas' legal situation is 
unknown, but it seems he will not be released until his role in 
the case is established. Federal agents sent from Mexico City 
and those stationed here are looking for the owner of the 
vehicle described by Gonzalez Diaz, who is also "a key figure" 
in solving this case.

  [Text] Mexico City, 28 Mar (EFE) -- A government source 
close to the investigation has told EFE that Tranquilino Sanchez 
Vega, whom a Mexican newspaper today implicated as an alleged 
accomplice of Luis Donaldo Colosio's murderer, has no ties with 
the presidential staff. According to the source, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], government ruling party 
since 1929, hired Sanchez Vega in Tijuana to assist in "crowd 
control" the same day Colosio was shot. Sanchez Vega was one of 
many men hired by the party to work as assistants in Colosio's 
campaign event in Tijuana, a city on the border with the United 
States. This hiring is done everywhere the party candidates hold 
events as part of their campaigns. 
  The source said also that Sanchez Garcia [name as received] 
does not work directly with nor is related to General Domiro 
Garcia Reyes, who had been charged by the presidential staff 
with Colosio's protection. The source said the PRI candidate's 
assassination was not the result of a plot, as determined by the 
investigations thus far. The attorney general is still studying 
the episode and the available videotapes of the murder. 
  Today, the Mexican newspaper EL UNIVERSAL said Colosio could 
have been the victim of a plot by some of his security members. 
The paper points to Sanchez Vega as one of the murderers' 
accomplices because in several videotapes available Sanchez Vega 
is seen clearing a path for the murderer. The investigations 
point to Mario Aburto Martinez as Colosio's confessed murderer 
and so far do not support the participation of other people in 
the assassination.

<F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Attorney General's Office has issued a 
bulletin explaining the charges filed against Mario Aburto 
Martinez and what will happen to him in terms of legal 
proceedings. Here is a report by Jesus Casasola: 
  [Begin Casasola recording] Mario Aburto Martinez has been 
formally arraigned without bail on charges of being responsible 
for the homicide of Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, candidate of 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Judge Alejandro Ortiz, 
First District criminal judge of Mexico State, made the official 
announcement at Almoloya de Juarez Prison, where newsmen were 
not allowed access. The judge said Aburto Martinez is accused of 
carrying a weapon without a license, which means he could be 
sentenced to more than 55 years, considering the maximum 
sentence for homicide is 50 years. Aburto Martinez's lawyer has 
three working days to appeal the judge's decision to allow the 
normal course of the trial to continue. [sentence as heard] 
  The Attorney General's Office indicated that other charges 
could be brought against him as the investigations progress. The 
Attorney General's Office has also released reports on Aburto 
Martinez's medical and drug tests. A report on the 
reconstruction of the crime and an inspection of the crime scene 
was compiled on the same day and includes 163 photos. In 
addition, the ballistic and forensic report noted that the 
wounds were caused by a .38-caliber revolver. 
  According to preliminary statements by Aburto Martinez, he 
was not studying to be a priest, but he was to become a priest. 
He said he did not belong to any political party or group and 
that some people nicknamed him "Gentleman Eagle" [Caballero 
Aguila] because of a ring he wore on his left hand. 
  Another important aspect is the testimony of Marcelina Ortiz 
Martinez, who said that a few days before the killing the 
suspect told her he was about to make a good deal of money in 
the next few days. She added that he showed her a revolver, 
which was the same .38-caliber revolver he used to kill Colosio. 
It was also reported that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, arrested 
in Tijuana, Baja California, on Sunday, was not a member of 
Colosio's security guards headed by General Domiro Garcia Reyes.

<F P=106> ["Public statement" by Deputy Attorney General Miguel Montes </F>
Garcia on 28 March; place not given; from the "24 Hours" 
newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Having been granted leave 
from my post as magistrate of the Supreme Court of Justice and 
with the approval of the Permanent Commission of the Congress, I 
hereby assume the responsibility of conducting the 
investigations that will lead to clearing up the murder of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] presidential candidate. With full awareness, I accept 
this responsibility that the president has entrusted upon me in 
the full exercise of his powers. According to our juridical 
system, the president is the only person who may grant such a 
responsibility. 
  Due to the seriousness of the action, everyone is aware of 
the importance of the task ahead. In order to comply with this 
delicate mission, I will act with an open mind, in a firm and 
serene manner. I will respond to those who have appointed me so 
that the law will be the main protection of society and the main 
instrument of justice. 
  As you will recall on the afternoon that the president 
announced his decision, he explained he was doing this at the 
specific request of Mrs. Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio [Luis 
Donaldo Colosio's widow], among other reasons. In fact, Mrs. 
Riojas de Colosio called me directly and honored me with her 
confidence. I am aware of the magnitude of the investigation 
that has been entrusted to me. My public commitment is with the 
truth. My method of work will strictly adhere to the juridical 
norms and the scientific techniques of an investigation that 
will lead us to solve a murder. 
  I am calling on the most distinguished Mexicans from the 
various areas that will be required for this task. I have 
designed a strict method of selection that will be applied 
indiscriminately to all those who will form part of the 
investigating team. I am demanding they present their resumes 
in order to analyze them. In the absence of even one 
requirement from those we feel are indispensable, they will be 
excluded. This method includes everyone, from the directors 
general to -- and with much more reason -- to the administrative 
staff, and -- of course -- the technical staff. In due time, we 
will announce the resumes of the team members who form part of 
this Office of the Deputy Attorney General. 
  The action of justice which allowed the immediate arrest of 
the perpetrator of the homicide as well as the profuse 
testimonies and other sources of information relevant to this 
case, make it possible for me to begin my work with an important 
database. As for the investigative matters, we are absolutely 
autonomous. The investigation process is the exclusive 
responsibility of this Office of the Deputy Attorney General, 
with no other limits but those established by the law. All 
investigations of this type have their own dynamics and strict 
logic. 
  I share the widespread concern for this to be carried out 
as soon as possible. I will seek through means established by 
law, new useful information. I ask anyone who has any 
information that can contribute to clearing up this event to 
make it known to me. I accept the people's demand to speed up 
these investigations, however, the very nature of the 
investigation determines that it not be subjected to a fixed 
timetable. 
  Neither in Mexico, nor anywhere in the world, should 
deadlines be set to conclude an investigation. It will last 
however long is necessary; we will strive for it to be brief. 
We will investigate and analyze all the possible hypotheses, 
even the smallest. We will try to report on the progress 
because we know that the Mexican people are waiting for this. 
An important part of this public responsibility's success 
depends on the fact that anticipated conclusions or versions are 
not generated without foundations. I know how to remain calm. 
My tool is my attachment to the truth and the law. We must be 
very careful not to distort the investigation's goal. I will 
also ask everyone to be calm and objective in the handling of 
this case, which has significant consequences for the nation. 
  The investigation cannot be subjected to foreign pressures, 
only to its logical and natural development. Every clue 
followed up, every witness' deposition, every piece of 
information received, can open multiple roads to follow. On 
several occasions, information has been made public that has led 
to inaccurate or mistaken conclusions. I will request from the 
media their support and responsibility so that the conclusions 
reached on the event be duly founded on the event. I am certain 
the media will responsibly report corroborated facts. To help 
them report, we will of course design a method so that 
periodically and officially they receive news on the work being 
carried out. We will never give out information that can hamper 
the ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, we will always make 
public whatever we have fully corroborated and which, I insist, 
will not hamper the ongoing investigation, or the honor, or 
reputation of innocent parties. 
  I feel the first moral duty is not to contribute to 
uncertainty with reports lacking precision that only foster an 
environment contrary to the spirit of truth and justice. This 
spirit is the superior demand undoubtedly expressed by all 
Mexicans at this time. 
  As of tomorrow I will be in Tijuana to personally take over 
this task the majority of leads and data to be substantiated are 
located there. I will conduct the investigation to the end with 
responsibility and without prejudice. Mexican society demands 
that this crime not remain unpunished. Mexican society will 
have the truth on the incident. I will establish responsible 
coordination and cooperation with the Baja California 
authorities. I will remain totally open to any cooperation; I 
reiterate, from the public and the media. I stress that the 
very sensitive nature of the case forces all of us to act 
responsibly and ethically. 
  I understand I am assuming an immense commitment to the 
nation; I will contribute with all my capacity. I conclude by 
saying once again that my commitment is only with the truth, so 
that out of the truth and only from the truth can justice be 
made. Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [From the "Upon Awakening" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] The PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] has 
issued several press bulletins. One of the press bulletins is 
on the meeting in Tijuana, Baja California, on the day Luis 
Donaldo Colosio was assassinated; another one on the activities 
being carried out to choose the new PRI presidential candidate; 
and the third issued last night by the PRI National Political 
Council. [passage omitted on details of bulletin on incidents in 
Tijuana covered by referent item] 
  The second press bulletin states that the PRI continues to 
maintain unity among its sectors, organizations, and members. It 
adds that the party is continuing with the various tasks that it 
must conduct as a political party. The PRI reiterates that it 
has yet to establish the date and hour for a meeting of the 
National Executive Committee or the National Political Council 
to begin the internal procedures to choose a new presidential 
candidate. The press bulletin adds that as soon as the National 
Executive Commission decides to begin the internal procedures 
for the selection of a new candidate, the people will be 
informed through the media. These bulletins were released 
yesterday. 
  Members of the National Political Council issued a third 
press bulletin. In the bulletin, the members state that: In 
light of the rumors regarding hypothetical changes and reforms 
to Article 82 of the Constitution and postponing the date for 
the federal elections, we publicly express our disagreement to 
said changes. In other words, the PRI National Political Council 
bulletin states that they are opposed to possible changes to 
Article 82 of the Constitution or other articles dealing with 
the possibility of postponing the date of the federal elections 
scheduled for 21 August. The bulletin adds: We reiterate our 
determination that the electoral process under way be conducted 
according to the Constitution and the law in the hopes that the 
state of law and the democratic principles that encourage us 
will be respected. The members of the National Political Council 
add in their bulletin: Once again, we reiterate our firm 
determination that the party, despite the sorrow it experiences, 
will maintain its obligation and unity to the commitments made 
by Luis Donaldo Colosio and supports the Mexican people's 
demands that justice be done. Those are the three press 
bulletins released yesterday by the PRI.

<F P=106> [Speech by Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the Mexican </F>
Institutional Revolutionary Party National Executive Committee, 
at the party's national headquarters in Mexico City; broadcast 
in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ...a document that contains a decision by the 
president of the National Executive Committee [CEN], of which I 
have already given an account to the CEN itself. As a member 
and especially as a leader of the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] my ethical responsibility and personal 
convictions have forced me to make the following statement: 
  It is the fundamental responsibility of the president of the 
PRI-CEN to maintain the PRI's unity and guide its forces in 
accordance with the fundamental principles and values that we 
have always maintained. Under such circumstances, any conduct 
motivated by personal ambitions could cause divisions within the 
party. To allow this would be very serious and irresponsible, to 
encourage it would betray the party's traditional order. 
  The death of our friend and comrade, Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
has generated unprecedented conditions for the party. Luis 
Donaldo was an exemplary member of the PRI; his pledges will 
continue to be ours. His proposals of change with security and 
responsibility will continue to be our political undertaking. 
Nothing better than this undertaking to keep his democratic 
example and his guiding presence alive. Thus, I consider it my 
unavoidable duty to say that as the PRI national leader I do not 
aspire to be nominated as a candidate to the presidency of the 
Republic. To aspire to such a nomination from the position I 
hold within the party would be disloyal to the political 
institution to which I owe unwavering adherence and fidelity. To 
do that would be to take advantage of a situation and it would 
thus be unacceptable. Such an aspiration would also violate my 
personal convictions and the pledge I made when I took the oath 
as president of the party's CEN. 
  No action is minor in the effort to strengthen and fortify 
our party. The PRI's traditional roots and basic elements 
demand that each of its members and leaders zealously fulfill 
their duty to keep the party solid and strong. Any dispersion of 
the PRI's forces will constitute a serious risk to the party's 
unity and stability, especially now, when it is absolutely 
necessary for us to close ranks around our principles, 
loyalties, institutions, laws, and President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. Nothing is more important for a member of the PRI -- 
and more so for the president of the PRI -- than to preserve and 
strengthen the value that the party's unity has always held for 
us. The president of the PRI must not lean in anyone's favor, 
let alone in his own favor. That is all, gentlemen. Thank you 
very much.

[CEN] of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] issued six 
clarification points regarding the organization and development 
of the rally presided over by Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio at 
the Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Baja California. 
  [Station announcer] This is probably in response to 
newspaper 
reports on the disorganization and lack of security surrounding 
the PRI candidate. 
  [Ahuactzin] That is correct. According to the PRI-CEN, this 
explanation is aimed at clarifying events. They expressed their 
willingness to provide more information if it is requested by 
judicial authorities. We will now proceed to read the six 
clarification points: 
  1. The rally with residents was held in accordance with the 
program. The aim was to have the best possibilities for contact 
between the candidate and citizens. 
  2. Luis Donaldo Colosio addressed residents from a stand 
on a pickup truck so the participants could have better 
visibility. 
  3. Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, general coordinator of 
Colosio's campaign, did not attend the Baja California rally 
because his participation in state visits was not deemed 
necessary. 
  4. Candidate Colosio was transferred immediately to the 
Tijuana General Hospital, which is close to the area of the 
attack. 
  5. Colosio was initially transferred to a blazer truck 
because it was close to the place where the tragedy took place. 
  6. From this truck, he was transferred to the assisting 
ambulance which was part of the rally's organization. 
  These are the six clarifications made by the PRI-CEN. 
Obviously, the PRI-CEN expressed its willingness to provide 
whatever information is necessary in order to clarify these 
tragic events.

  [Text] Lima, 28 Mar (DPA) -- In statements given to a 
Peruvian television station and reported by Lima newspapers, a 
youth leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said 
that Luis Donaldo Colosio, the assassinated governmental 
presidential candidate, would have fallen "victim to a 
conspiracy that the highest power spheres plotted." 
  Ramiro de la Rosa, the PRI representative who heads the 
Youth 
Secretariat of the Latin American Parliament, blamed some 
government officials, whom he refused to name, for the "climate 
of conspiracy that surrounded the assassination." He told 
"Panamericana Television Network" that the Mexican media has 
virtually ignored him, adding that President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari will exploit Colosio's death to "promote a candidate 
that lacks the support of the PRI's rank and file and that fails 
to meet the expectations of the Mexican people." He said: "We 
and the Mexican people are demanding that President Salinas not 
be involved in the selection of the presidential candidate for 
the upcoming elections." 
  The youth leader also accused the president of "having 
endorsed and encouraged the ambitions of the PRI's dubious 
leader Manuel Camacho Solis." De la Rosa added that the 
government has used Camacho to create specific political 
situations. 
  The Lima newspaper LA REPUBLICA published de la Rosa's 
statements today by running a front-page headline that reads: 
"It Was a Plot." This report differs from that of assassin 
Mario Aburto, which also received ample coverage. Aburto 
maintained that he worked alone and followed no one's orders. 
  In his interview with the "Panorama" talk show, however, de 
la Rosa expressed optimism for the PRI's future: "There is a 
large sector that maintains a position of democracy, openness, 
and renewal. I am not alone; there is a growing democratizing 
current."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with former Interior Secretary </F>
Fernando Gutierrez Barrios by SIEMPRE! General Director Beatriz 
Pages Rebollar; place and date not given: "In Light of Mexico's 
Difficult Transition, `A Political Agreement Is Necessary'"] 
  [Text] In light of a confused and tense national scenario 
marked by an armed uprising that on 1 January shook the 
foundations of the system and in light of the confrontation 
between the three most important presidential candidates and the 
clouds of violence that may unleash their fury following the 21 
August federal elections, SIEMPRE! set out to find a serene 
thought capable of untangling the puzzling scenario left from 
the latest events. 
  Fernando Gutierrez Barrios broke his customary silence and 
decided to speak about the most sensitive topics of the moment: 
guerrillas, elections, democracy, political parties, 
negotiations in Chiapas, social peace, crisis in the system, 
participation of the clergy in politics, and the controversial 
personality of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  With his prudent but also energetic style, Fernando defined 
concepts, marked routes, and warned about the dangers that may 
affect the country's stability if no serious political agreement 
is reached with all national forces, "not only with the parties, 
but also the different representative organizations that take 
part in Mexico's life." 
  A man of institutions, principles, and values and a man of 
unquestionable moral righteousness and deep nationalism, 
Gutierrez Barrios commented and made remarks with the authority 
bestowed upon him by his vast knowledge of the Mexican political 
system. 
  "Beatriz, before starting this interview," Fernando 
Gutierrez 
Barrios explained, "I first wish to thank you for your kind 
presence here, as well as for giving me the opportunity to have 
an open and cordial dialogue with a person whom I respect and 
admire. I am at your disposal." 
  [Pages] Fernando, what are, in your opinion, the elements 
that characterize the Zapatist National Liberation Army compared 
to other guerrilla movements in Latin America? 
  [Gutierrez] To answer your question, one would have to 
analyze in detail different Latin American societies in each 
historical period and later understand the specific conditions 
of the guerrillas. 
  The armed struggle in the form of guerrillas has an old 
tradition in Latin America which dates back to even before the 
Cuban Revolution which, due to its proximity, is the most 
well-known. All guerrilla movements had varied ideological 
inspiration, ranging from radical liberals to nationalists to 
even Marxists. 
  Cuban revolutionary theory, the best example of which was 
Ernesto "Che" Guevara, can be summarized in a few points. 
First, "armed struggle" as the only way to reach power; second, 
"continental" projection of the revolution due to the similarity 
of "objective conditions" in Latin American countries; third, 
the socialist character of the revolution; fourth, the thesis 
that peasants, and not the working class, were the segment of 
society with higher revolutionary potentiality; and fifth, the 
concept of a vanguard composed of intellectuals, professionals, 
and students. 
  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), where 
father Camilo Torres briefly served, acted with that same 
orientation. 
  We must also mention that the Poor People's Guerrilla Army 
of Guatemala is also of Cuban inspiration and also includes 
Indians in its ranks. The other Guatemalan guerrilla group: 
Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA) also 
placed great emphasis on the Indians. 
  The leading guerrilla movements of the late sixties and 
seventies separated themselves from Cuban theory, especially by 
focusing on nationalism rather than socialism as well as by 
their urban origin and influence. The 19 April Movement [M-19] 
of Colombia, the Montoneros of Argentina, the Tupamaros of 
Uruguay, the National Liberation Army of Carlos Marighella of 
Brazil, famous for his Minimanual of the Urban Guerrillas, are 
examples. The first two groups -- the M-19 and the Montoneros 
-- have in common that they are organized by populist forces and 
struggled for a true democracy as their main demand. 
  The Sandinist National Liberation Front of Nicaragua ruled 
the country as the government after its victory, and today it is 
acting within the framework of democracy. The Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front of El Salvador, after the peace 
agreements, is seeking power through elections today. 
  Finally, we must mention the Shining Path, a unique Peruvian 
organization, which despite the serious defeats it has 
sustained, continues to harass the government. 
  The ones I have mentioned are only a few of the nearly 100 
guerrilla movements in Latin America from the days of Carlos 
Prestes in Brazil in the 1920's to now. You can, therefore, see 
that the elements that must be analyzed are extensive. 
  The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army" has taken 
heterogeneous elements from the aforementioned experiences, and 
its unprecedented character consists of the way it reunites 
these experiences. The overwhelming Indian presence shows an 
identification with the Guatemalan movements, and the emphasis 
placed on democratic demands, social justice, and land ownership 
as well as its flexible ideological inclinations, identifies it 
with the M-19 and the Montoneros. The spectacular actions, on 
the other hand -- bearing in mind the difference of scenarios -- 
identify it with those of the Tupamaros and the MIR [Movement 
of the Revolutionary Left] of Chile. The participation and 
influence of certain sectors linked to the Church is an element 
that coincides with those of certain groups from El Salvador -- 
especially the FPL [Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces] 
-- Colombia, and Argentina. In sum they are carrying the banner 
of poverty, ideological syncretism, and of the work to persuade 
Indian communities, as well as the skillful use of psychological 
warfare and its expression in political propaganda. As for 
their military capability, it appears to be reduced and limited 
to a certain geographical area. Their activities are conducted 
with the tactic of guerrilla focus. That is why it is not 
accurate to establish a mechanical analogy with other Latin 
American movements. 
  [Pages] What is your opinion of the government's reaction 
with regard to the guerrillas? Was it not paralyzed at the 
beginning? 
  [Gutierrez] A fundamental element of the guerrillas is the 
element of surprise. If the guerrillas lose the initiative to 
attack where it is most advisable for them, it will not proceed 
according to its own nature. It is evident that they took 
advantage of this element in addition to the skillful use of 
information and psychological warfare, as well as its effects on 
national and international public opinion. We should be pleased 
to see that the government's response was one of great maturity. 
Prudence and composure and civilized dialogue instead of the 
temptation to harden the government's positions and react 
violently prevailed. The government declared a unilateral 
cease-fire, an amnesty was offered, and cabinet changes were 
made without demands being made. Even though what has happened 
is the result of an accumulation of unsolved problems, mistakes 
were honestly recognized, the state's governor was changed, 
multiparty commissions were created, and the National Human 
Rights Commission, in the fulfillment of its duties, visited the 
area of conflict. They have all been political solutions of 
conciliation. A peace commission for Chiapas was even 
appointed. The president of the Republic held a dialogue in 
Tuxtla Gutierrez with the leaders of the different ethnic 
groups. This is how the government has irreproachably responded 
within the framework of the state of law by supporting the 
actions of the Mexican Army and avoiding situations of armed 
pressure against the country's institutions given that the 
political times of the end of the current six-year period and 
the proximity of the federal elections could be used against the 
government both by the guerrillas themselves as well as by 
heterogeneous groups, which, stimulated by the presence of the 
so-called "Zapatist army," could try to take advantage of the 
opportunity to make innumerable demands through different forms 
of pressure. 
  [Pages] Don't you think that the big loser in this 
conflict has been the Army? 
  [Gutierrez] The Army is strictly carrying out the orders it 
receives as stated in the Constitution. It is undeniable that 
circumstances have been difficult. Efforts have been made to 
irresponsibly discredit the Army. The Army went from being 
attacked to being the aggressor, with the obvious manipulation 
of ideological change, which is another form of propaganda of 
ideological warfare. The National Army is an exemplary 
institution with a revolutionary and popular origin. Its 
sacrifice and service to the Republic, inseparable in its role 
as guarantor of the country's sovereignty, cannot be questioned 
by an obviously biased campaign of discredit. The Mexican Army 
has once again proven its serenity, maturity, discipline, and 
institutionalism. 
  [Pages] What would be the alternatives for solving the 
conflict in Chiapas? 
  [Gutierrez] I think that the ideal solution would be a 
dignified negotiation for both sides. Priority attention must 
be given to the just and reasonable demands made by the rebels 
who must end this conflict by turning over their weapons. There 
can be no ambiguities on this point. If a serious, just, and 
dignified negotiation cannot be conducted because of dogmatic 
intransigence, the problem would prolong itself, most certainly, 
until 21 August came with elections subjected to a perverse 
pressure. If law and order is not restored in that area of the 
country and the conflict continues, it will be a negative burden 
on the electoral process, the transfer of power, and the 
country's tranquility. 
  [Pages] How do you think violence in Chiapas will affect the 
upcoming electoral process? 
  [Gutierrez] Objectively speaking, no one can deny that the 
country was upset, as was the political situation. Worried 
about Chiapas, the social forces demand a clean electoral 
process and thus new reforms to Federal Code of Electoral 
Institutions and Procedures, something that will certainly be 
accomplished during the special period of sessions. 
Psychologically, citizens have been subjected to different 
influences. A large portion of the population has been affected 
as to their political preference. Citizens will study their 
vote more carefully. Consequently, it is important that the 
parties and their candidates face social problems through more 
updated, redeeming, and honest speeches. It is indispensable to 
have more social sensitivity and political keenness. The 
citizens have been exposed to unpredictable reactions, caused by 
actions that are foreign to them, such as that which occurred in 
Chiapas, and which move them to profound meditation. 
  [Pages] How do you view the panorama of political parties? 
  [Gutierrez] Politics, it has been said, is the art of the 
possible, but it is an art of imagination to see beyond what is 
immediate. Political parties are going through a crisis of 
representation and credibility throughout the world. This is 
evident in the voters' rejection and abstention. I think that 
political speeches must be better drafted, making them more 
accessible, specific, and comprehensible. Today's Mexicans 
deserve to be spoken to with a simple language of great truths, 
respecting their intelligence and dignity. Old formulas must be 
pushed aside, alliances must be sought, the political space must 
be widened, and we must include, not exclude. This must be done 
here and now. Those with the lowest standard of living and the 
worst jobs require special attention. I think that it must be 
emphasized that without social justice and commitment to 
specific situations, democracy becomes an abstraction without 
any relation to the country, the social sector, or the people of 
flesh and blood. We must take care of those who have not as 
well as the middle class, because the delicate balance between 
order and freedom cannot be subjected to the dangerous extremes 
of opulence and misery. 
  [Pages] What specifically is your opinion of the PRI? 
  [Gutierrez] As a member of the party, although somewhat 
distanced from active politics, I would venture to say that 
because of the strength of its structures and traditional 
organization, the PRI has managed to reach the people and 
maintain its position as a ruling party. The great civic 
awakening among the people, however, has affected it. No longer 
can a candidate to any given office be selected arbitrarily, 
either because of friendship or popularity. Dialogue has 
replaced monologue. Within this new open and pluralist society 
-- a society whose influence is becoming increasingly strong -- 
the PRI defines its ideals by nurturing itself from the 
ever-present principles of the Mexican Revolution. These are 
the principles that identify the party and its supporters; these 
principles comprise its raison d'etre. The pluralist society, 
which is ever more knowledgeable and critical, has taught us 
hard lessons through its credibility, honesty, and knowledge of 
reality. Nowadays, in order to win we must first convince the 
voters, because votes do indeed count and are indeed counted. 
As I said before, nowadays we need dynamic, open campaigns -- 
campaigns that challenge the people, address the problems that 
grieve us, and offer solutions. We must continue to consult the 
people on a broad in-depth basis to enable them to express their 
social concerns, make their demands, and, consequently, receive 
an answer. This is the new policy. It is consistent with our 
times and with the current circumstances. I believe the PRI 
will have to reaffirm its doctrine; strengthen its 
organizations, rank-and-file, and electoral structures; and 
basically revitalize its convictions and winning spirit to 
effectively support its candidates and lead them to victory. 
  Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio is carrying out an 
enthusiastic campaign in which he is giving all of himself. It 
is a dynamic campaign, consistent with the current circumstances 
and with the political, economic, and social requirements of the 
specific stage the country is in. His proposals as outlined in 
his speeches have received a warm welcome among the people -- 
especially those regarding PRI autonomy and the reform of power, 
which is understood to be a greater balance among various 
powers, as well as those that address social justice, 
sovereignty, human rights, democracy, and freedom with respect 
for the Constitution and the laws of the state. 
  [Pages] What is your opinion of the candidates from the 
other 
parties? 
  [Gutierrez] I know all of the candidates, because I met some 
while I was interior secretary and others some years before that 
during my long political career. All deserve my greatest 
respect, whether or not I agree with their political positions. 
They are all good Mexicans who think of the higher values and 
interests of the nation before their personal or partisan 
interests. Despite their political differences, they all agree 
that democracy, and not violence, is what can bring about change 
with stability, change with social justice and freedom, and 
change that should emanate from society itself. 
  [Pages] There are three candidates from three, let us say, 
strong political parties, who will face each other in the 
presidential race. In general terms, what does each one 
represent to the nation? 
  [Gutierrez] They represent a historic opportunity. Partisan 
institutions are the expression of democracy. They will have to 
debate with civility and discuss the alternatives and programs 
each contender has to offer. Mexico gains by this. Debate is 
the best way to put the strength of any political party's ideals 
to the test. The Mexico of today comprises a pluralistic society 
that brings together various ideologies and trends represented 
by the different political parties. The unchanging nature of 
democracy is that the majority rules, but the minorities also 
have their place in the country's everyday life. That is the 
country's future. 
  [Pages] What is your view regarding the role played by the 
media in the elections? 
  [Gutierrez] The media are the loyal conveyors of the 
political situation. The media will play a pivotal role in the 
1994 electoral process. They will allow society to obtain 
information on the candidates, their programs, and leadership 
capabilities. That is exactly what the new Mexico implies. 
Once more, the media's responsibility will be decisive, and 
this can only be achieved in a country such as ours, where 
freedom of expression is respected. 
  [Pages] The opposition has indicated that there could be a 
popular uprising if the election results are not respected. 
What do you think about violence? 
  [Gutierrez] I am convinced that social peace is based on 
respect for the individual, life, and liberty, without allowing 
the exercise of our rights to impinge on other people's rights. 
The Mexican people reject violence. No one can live amid 
anarchy and chaos just as peace cannot be imposed with 
authoritarian measures. The Mexican Government, in addition to 
the legal norms that rule the institutions, wields one of the 
best weapons: dialogue, reason, and law, because moving away 
from it would be the worst path to follow. The political 
parties, even with their ideological differences and their 
projects, have a common goal -- to achieve the advancement of 
Mexico and the benefit of the majorities as well as to preserve 
the de jure state. Even when the debates are at times harsh, 
which is normal considering the emotions political campaigns can 
stir, today a higher level of maturity on the part of the 
parties and society as a whole is perceived. This higher 
maturity, combined with a respect for electoral laws and the 
individual right to vote, will lead to a peaceful transfer of 
power. 
  [Pages] Do you believe that what has been called the Mexican 
political system is still in effect? 
  [Gutierrez] The Mexican political system is still in effect; 
it is on its own a revolutionary project and not a rhetorical 
abstraction. It constitutes a project that includes all 
political trends -- left, right, and center; professional groups 
from the social and business sectors; organizations of young 
people, women, and intellectuals; political parties; urban 
popular movements; and so on, all of whom participate in the 
political arena in the manner they deem most appropriate. It is 
fundamental to point out that all of the country's political 
parties have freedom of expression. No one is denied the right 
to fight for Mexico. We are not a monolithic society. The 
revolution has given birth to several trends, and it welcomes 
those who represent them. 
  Nevertheless, excessive pluralism is not desirable because 
it 
divides and ideologically confuses the population. I believe 
the course for Mexico is that of a moderate pluralism with the 
respectful coexistence of our current political and ideological 
groups so that they can contribute to the country's progress. 
  [Pages] What is your view regarding the dialogue taking 
place 
in San Cristobal de las Casas? 
  [Gutierrez] As I told you before, this dialogue is positive. 
A mature dialogue leads to peace and harmony. While a dialogue 
is held, the cannon remains silent, but what is important is to 
move from dialogue to negotiation. A negotiation could become 
stagnant if it lacks the will and understanding of all to seek 
solutions with honesty and realism. This stage is a civilized 
and worthwhile chance to find peace. The deliberate confusion 
between politics and the spiritual aspect must be avoided. The 
baseless presumption that the "Zapatist National Liberation 
Army" can be maintained as a pressure group until the August 
elections and is allowed, because of this, to assume a higher 
role than the de jure state to supervise the legality and the 
purity of the elections must be overcome through dialogue and 
negotiation. In turn, it is vital to separate the Chiapas 
conflict from the presidential elections; strive to make the 
latter trustworthy, convincing, and irreproachable; and prevent 
the post-electoral period from becoming troublesome. 
  [Pages] According to the difficult times the country is 
experiencing, what should be next? 
  [Gutierrez] It is difficult to state one's opinions when one 
is not responsible and, above all, does not have total and 
objective information of the national problems. However, the 
situation can be summed up in the following basic aspects: 
adequate and honorable negotiations with the "Zapatist army," a 
task aimed at strengthening what unites us all and the 
construction of better bridges between society and the 
government; a political agreement based on strong foundations 
accepted by all with the country's political forces, not just 
the parties, but the different representative organizations that 
participate in the country's life. 
  [Pages] Regarding the clergymen's intervention in politics, 
which becomes more evident each passing day, and which you 
addressed as interior secretary, what is your viewpoint now? 
  [Gutierrez] My opinion is the same. The important thing is 
that Mexican clergymen do not behave as clergymen do elsewhere 
on this continent, where their intervention and influence is key 
to government actions. That is why the wise decision of 
President Juarez separating church and state, leaving each 
sector with its legal and spiritual responsibilities, becomes 
important these days. 
  [Pages] What is your opinion about the political personality 
of Manuel Camacho Solis and regarding his latest statements? 
  [Gutierrez] Camacho Solis is fulfilling, as it has been 
said, 
the responsibility entrusted upon him by President Salinas to 
overcome the conflict in Chiapas. Regarding Camacho's political 
opinions, he made use of his freedom to express his ideas, as 
all Mexicans can do. However, at this moment what our country 
-- which is immersed in political confusion that generates 
financial instability and social problems such as poverty, 
sometimes extreme in some regions -- needs is to avoid useless 
confrontation, confusion, division, and skepticism. This will 
permit us to achieve peace and harmony among Mexicans, so as to 
preserve the political stability which is the foundation of our 
progress and development. 
  [Pages] Which are the main issues that should be addressed 
in 
the next six-year term? 
  [Gutierrez] Undoubtedly, the economic program of President 
Salinas has yielded satisfactory results, particularly insofar 
as the macroeconomic indicators. However, emphasis must be 
given to the social demands of poor sectors, without 
disregarding the fight against inflation, which has been 
successful. Emphasis must also be placed on continuing the 
economic reactivation to allow the broadening of the job base 
and offer decent jobs to all Mexicans. Without job 
opportunities, it would be illusory to think of social welfare. 
  Another public general demand that must be heeded, because 
it 
is a priority, is public security, as well as protection of 
persons and properties. This necessarily entails an in-depth 
reform in the police corps, professionalizing them and making 
them really serve the community. 
  Tied to the previous point, the fight against corruption in 
all its forms must be strengthened. Said forms of corruption 
range from corruption against citizens on the streets to the 
more complex forms such as inexplicable enrichments and 
inefficiency, which is another form of corruption. Within this 
framework, we must include the basic topics of social justice, 
health, education, justice administration and implementation, 
housing, and roads. 
  To conclude, I would tell you that aware of the difficult 
problems the country is facing at this moment, Mexico has a 
challenge for the future but we must have confidence in our 
abilities and fundamentally human resources. It is evident that 
we have come a long way in the post-revolutionary decades, but 
we must be aware of the fact that there is still much to be 
done. The policy of paying the social debts we have with the 
have-nots in the country and the city must not be overlooked. 
However, we also know, without eluding responsibility for 
neglect or deficiencies, that it will be a long time before we 
can definitely resolve these long-time problems. The resources 
and the economic capacity of the Mexican State are limited and 
are subject to internal factors, among them demographic growth 
that demands each day more health centers, more schools, more 
housing, as well as external factors that do not depend on our 
will. 
  [Pages] You once predicted the end of the era of the 
vertical power structure. Luis Donaldo Colosio is now proposing 
"a power reform." Is there compatibility? 
  [Gutierrez] We agree on the need for change in the face of 
hegemonical ambitions and the complex social, political, and 
economic problems of our times. We are approaching the third 
millennium amid political, economic, and social convulsion in a 
world where something collapses and something else emerges each 
day. We are witnesses to ideological collapses, the presence of 
religious, ethnic, and nationalist fundamentalisms, and the 
birth of a globalization process from which we cannot separate 
ourselves. We will persist in maintaining our nationalism and 
on safeguarding our culture, traditions, customs, and identity. 
We must, however, realize that what is described as a 
paternalistic and centralized policy is a thing of the past. 
  [Pages] The IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] recognized 
that the hegemony of the PRI was lost and that the alternation 
of power is feasible. What is your opinion? 
  [Gutierrez] In fact, the end of the single party system was 
predicted. The end of the PRI's prevalence was also predicted. 
There are some people, however, who think the opposite based on 
the legacy of social peace and development achieved in its 65 
years of life, without denying the failures and mistakes that 
were made. Let us view this as follows: alternation of power 
as mandated by electoral preference is as feasible and 
legitimate as the efforts [atigencia] that the PRI rank and file 
is making to adjust to a changing society. A PRI based on 
caudillo origins is not the same as a party that has adjusted to 
national mobility. That is precisely the key to its survival: 
nonparalyzation of its strategies and programs and its 
permanent attempts to adjust to national reality. 
  [Pages] It is said that certain states of the republic are 
at the brink of social explosion. How can the discontent of the 
citizens be moderated? How have we failed? Is the government's 
prevalence over? 
  [Gutierrez] An old saying on democracy by Francisco Bulnes 
[Mexican politician and sociologist] comes to mind. He said: 
"When people say at noon that night has come upon us, we must 
start turning on the street lamps." Today the country's 
transformation, the construction of the new Mexico, the Mexico 
of the 85 million citizens with its shortages that could lead us 
to desperation, makes us see the need for unity with equality 
that can bring about change with the participation of all 
political forces as well as the consolidation of a state in 
which solutions can be implemented without trauma, excesses, or 
any messianic role-playing. 
  [Pages] The third millennium is approaching. The world has 
changed. What are the challenges for our country? 
  [Gutierrez] The challenges are visible. Civil society, 
increasingly perceptive, marks the changes. In the social 
field, the demands are self-evident; in the political field, 
society demands an opening toward pluralism; and in the economic 
field, it demands the need to strengthen the well-being of our 
families to achieve development. 
  The world is changing today. Mexico seeks to be consistent. 
We are moving along a difficult path that can be overcome with 
the observance of the law and with the support of dialogue and 
concerted effort. I believe that is the path. Our national 
fate is at stake. The best heritage of the nation should be 
based on stability with social peace, democracy, social justice, 
unity, harmony, and composure. It seems repetitive, but in 
Mexico we must change -- not in order to stop existing but to be 
better. 
  [Pages] What can we expect from the 21 August elections with 
an increasing and violent opposition? 
  [Gutierrez] Fatalism or manifest destinies do not function 
in 
Mexico. We do not expect the 21 August elections to be easy. 
We expect them to be intense and participatory. Today more 
than 40 million Mexicans have the right to vote and, without a 
doubt, it will be the best demonstration that democracy has been 
ratified. The electoral framework has been created, and 
political offers are visible. Now the important thing is to 
settle the electoral process through the polls and not through 
violence. 
  Experience shows us that disorder and violence only benefit 
the hegemonic forces promoting backwardness. I am sure that 
social peace is based on respect for the human being, life, and 
freedom without the exercise of our rights having to adversely 
affect the rights of others.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcos Chavez M.] </F>
  [Text] Although in the current six-year term, financial 
savings [ahorro financiero] increased in an extraordinary manner 
-- it went from 31 percent to about 45 percent of GNP between 
1988 and 1993 -- such resources have not produced a significant 
increase in domestic savings and capital accumulation as was 
expected. 
  Domestic savings are stagnant at 6.5 percent of GNP, that 
is, 
10 percent under the highest level reached in 1979. This has 
become a serious structural obstacle to achieving self-financing 
[financiamiento autonomo] of the economy. This will demand a 
growing foreign debt to reach high growth rates as long as 
financial reform does not mature. 
  Although investment as a ratio of GNP recovered slightly 
between 1986 and 1993, it is still about 7 percent under the 
1982 figure, according to information issued by the Bank of 
Mexico and Nacional Financiera and the Fifth Government Report, 
which EL FINANCIERO reviewed. 
  Jose Luis Calva, researcher for the Economic Research 
Institute of the UNAM [National Autonomous University of 
Mexico], thinks that the launching of the neo-liberal model was 
based on the diagnosis that insufficient domestic savings was 
among the "main causes" of the foreign debt crisis. This was 
provoked by the so-called "financial repression" that limited 
the expansion of investment, maintained negative real interest 
rates, promoted the inefficiency of local intermediaries, and 
restricted an efficient allocation of resources. It was argued 
that domestic financial deregulation and the opening of foreign 
markets would promote domestic savings and investment. 
  Calva thinks that the problem was that only financial 
savings 
(M4 minus bills and coins in circulation) grew while domestic 
savings "collapsed" and investment, which has not managed to 
return to the levels reached in the early 1980's despite a heavy 
inflow of foreign capital. [sentence as published]. Thus, at 
present there is heavy dependence on foreign savings [ahorro 
externo] to maintain the rhythm of expansion with the risks that 
financial dependence entail. 
  Financial savings increased from 32 to about 45 percent of 
GNP between 1982 and 1993. This situation stemmed from the fact 
that real interest rates were unusually higher than foreign 
interests rates. This and increases in the value of assets in 
the stock market afforded foreign investors significant profits 
in the money market. 
  Financial savings, however, are not in line with domestic 
savings and investment because -- paradoxically -- part of the 
foreign capital has been used to increase the central bank's 
international reserves, to increase the demand for imported 
goods -- which was repressed for 80 years for affecting the 
balance of payments on the current accounts -- and to increase 
savings and financing of private investment abroad. 
  Domestic savings, however, have moved the opposite way. 
Although they improved, relatively speaking, between 1988 and 
1989, by 1993 they had dropped to 6.5 percent of GNP, the lowest 
figure of any six-year period and 10 percent lower than the best 
year, 1979. In fact, the expost effective domestic savings 
[ahorro local efectivo expost] appears insensitive to the high 
real passive rates [altas tasas pasivas reales] paid. The gap 
between savings and investment has become a "bottleneck" for the 
economy, especially for companies that have no access to foreign 
financing and stay away from bank credit. 
  Bank savings (M2) also dropped between 1987 and 1993. They 
went from 24.5 percent of GNP to about 20 percent in 1993. This 
shows that the so-called "bank modernization" has not even come 
close to the goals that justified it. 
  Even more serious is the fact that due to the shortage of 
domestic savings, the potential for growth will continue to 
increasingly depend on foreign savings and fluctuations of 
foreign capital (direct financial investment) whose limits could 
be reached anytime. After an apparent absence between 1982 and 
1987, foreign savings as a ratio of GNP reached 6-7 percent in 
1993. 
  Investment is not in line with financial savings either. It 
was 27 percent of GNP in 1980. It was 20.4 percent of GNP in 
1988, and will probably reach 20 percent of GNP in 1993. In 
contrast, capital accumulation was a victim of stabilization 
policies and structural adjustments.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez and </F>
guest Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine; place and date not given 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Good afternoon friends, this is Straight 
Talk. Why is it those who were not invited to the upcoming 
meeting in Havana on the nation and the emigres were not 
included? This is the topic Luis Sexto, a reporter for BOHEMIA 
magazine, and your host, Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE 
will discuss. I turn the time over to my colleague. 
  [Sexto] Osvaldo, we must begin by saying that we still do 
not 
know who is invited and who is not. We still do not have the 
names of those who have been invited or of those who have said 
that they will come to this meeting convened by the 
revolutionary government to discuss relations between Cuba and 
its emigres. I believe that by explaining the aim or the goal of 
the this conference we can explain why there are many people who 
have emigrated but who will not be able to attend this 
conference, which will be held in April. As I was saying, by 
analyzing the goal or the aim, we will be able to understand why 
some, who lament or oppose the observance of this conference 
from abroad, will not attend. In other words, this conference 
will be held to discuss and analyze the relations that exist and 
the normalization of those relations between Cuba and Cuban 
emigrants. 
  [Rodriguez] We must specify that it is not a dialogue. That 
is something....[pauses] Because some people have confused this 
meeting of Cubans on the island with their relatives who 
emigrated abroad, to the United States or any other place, with 
the dialogue that was proposed by opponents to the revolutionary 
project. We must understand that this is not a dialogue. 
  [Sexto] Well, the word dialogue, in a semantic sense, is one 
that connotes cordiality. It is a positive word. But in the 
current political language, the counterrevolution's political 
language, it is a double-edged word. When you talk about 
establishing a dialogue with someone, it is because you 
recognize in that person a belligerency or sufficient power for 
you to dialogue with him, and even to reconcile yourself with 
that person. Dialogue implies establishing agreements and it 
implies a certain reconciliation. That is the reason that in the 
counterrevolution's political language, the language that is so 
commonly used in Miami or Madrid, dialogue has that connotation 
-- as if the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionary government, or 
socialist Cuba, had to dialogue with its opponents abroad. 
  [Rodriguez] Who do not represent any political force. 
  [Sexto] Exactly. They represent only the forces of their own 
interests. We will talk about this in a minute. 
  I believe Cuba is not going to dialogue with its enemies. 
Cuba has called a conference where it will talk with certain 
emigrants, with certain people, on relations with Cuban emigres. 
You know very well that Cuban emigration has been a process. The 
Cuban emigration has been grossly manipulated by the United 
States of America. We must consider how, from the beginning of 
this process in 1959 and in the 60's, human feelings and needs 
have been manipulated to the point that they would serve the 
political interests of the illegitimate sons [espurios] and 
bastards -- excuse me for using such harsh words. 
  Therefore, the Cuban emigration process must be looked at 
with certain objectivity, because emigration is a world 
phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that characterizes today's world. 
It has been rarefied by political interests, political interests 
of interference, ambitious political interests, and illegitimate 
political interests. 
  [Rodriguez] We are talking to Luis Sexto, a reporter for 
BOHEMIA magazine on a topic that is being discussed in Havana 
and other places in the world: the upcoming meeting in Havana of 
the nation and the emigres. We are discussing why those who were 
not included were not included. 
  [Sexto] In other words, why it is that those who will not be 
there will not be there. That would be the appropriate term. 
Because those who will not be, or those who cannot be, at this 
conference are those who demand that the Revolution give up its 
power. It is that group who would like to return to Cuba to 
impose their vision and class interests. That is very clear. 
Those who will come will be emigrants who wish to maintain good, 
stable, and cordial relations with their native country. Just 
recently I wrote an article in BOHEMIA in which I commented on 
the phenomenon of emigration and its history in our country and 
I proposed the hypothesis that emigration generally has two 
sides, especially the Cuban emigration. First, a political 
emigration: an emigration of people who oppose the Revolution or 
who have been affected in a sense by the Revolution. 
  [Rodriguez] In other words, class enemies. 
  [Sexto] Enemies of the Revolution who went abroad to seek 
support with the intent of returning. What distinguishes 
political emigration from economic emigration is the urge to 
return. Then we have the other side, which is the economic 
emigrant. 
  [Rodriguez] Before you talk about the economic emigrant, 
these political emigrants want to return to Cuba and occupy the 
position they once had. 
  [Sexto] Right. 
  [Rodriguez] That is why they ask the Revolution to give up 
its power. 
  [Sexto] Right. The political emigrant goes abroad to prepare 
his return and with his return to reimpose his interests, 
vision, and the supremacy of his class or party. For now, Cuba 
has nothing to talk about with those who, from abroad, conspire 
against the nation. Because, obviously, those political groups 
who, from Miami or Madrid, propose or want a dialogue are 
combating and harassing Cuba. What they want is to take power 
from the Revolution. As a matter of fact, what do some of the 
more moderate members of that political group, that political 
superstructure, propose for Cuba? To solve Cuba's problems? To 
solve them in such a way that would benefit the majority of the 
Cuban people, that would allow the Cuban people to continue 
enjoying the achievements brought about by the Revolution? No! 
  The least moderate of these groups asks for a multiparty 
system, private property, general openings and uncontrolled 
foreign investments, subordination to the United States. Those 
are their demands. I doubt that any Cuban citizen with a 
patriotic conscience would be able to consider the most minute 
possibility of sitting down to discuss those issues with the 
enemies of Cuba. 
  [Rodriguez] You were going to talk about economic emigrants 
when I interrupted you. 
  [Sexto] The economic emigrant is the person who leaves to 
seek better living conditions. He leaves for the purpose of 
starting a new life. For the economic emigrant, what he leaves 
behind does not present a conflict. He is leaving to start a new 
life. He probably does not even want to return because the 
economic emigrant breaks his connections with the past. He has a 
different goal. The economic emigrant is sometimes nostalgic for 
his roots but he does not think about returning. 
  Osvaldo, I am the son and grandson of emigrants. My 
grandparents came from Spain to Cuba. Part of my family, 
especially my parents, emigrated after the triumph of the Cuban 
Revolution; I know the mechanics and the nature of the emigrant 
because I learned about it from my own family. My grandparents 
never talked about returning to Spain. I believe that my 
relatives who left Cuba at the beginning of the Revolution have 
never expressed the desire to reestablish themselves in Cuba. 
  Therefore, I believe that the majority of Cuban emigres 
during these 35 years -- because there was emigration in Cuba 
prior to the Revolution, and in the 50's there was growing 
emigration -- I believe that in some years, such as 1956, more 
than 25,000 Cubans went to the U.S. Interests Section to ask for 
visas to enter the United States, to live and work there. The 
phenomenon of emigration is a bit old in Cuba. It was not caused 
by the Cuban Revolution. It reached its peak with the Revolution. 
  Therefore, the majority of economic emigrants who live in 
the 
United States and other countries around the world, those who 
will come to talk with Cuban authorities, will come to converse 
on how to establish a line of communication with what we could 
call the Cuban diaspora. How to achieve stable and firm ties, 
despite the world situation, with their native land. That is 
what they will come to discuss and that is all that the 
conference will allow to be discussed. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, and in the political sense, I believe the 
United States will no longer be able to use that portion of the 
emigres as a political weapon or as a hostage to its policy. 
  [Sexto] The United States politicized emigration and we did 
too, as a reflection or as a rejection. As an imposition of the 
struggle, we also helped politicize emigration. There was a time 
when we thought that a person who left the country was taking 
sides against the Cuban Revolution and the country; that is not 
true. Practice and experience have demonstrated that that is not 
true and it is time to refocus and change our point of view. 
  [Rodriguez] Why is it those who were not invited to the 
upcoming meeting in Havana on the nation and emigration were not 
invited? Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine has spoken to us on 
this topic.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Miguel Pourier, Netherlands </F>
Antillean prime minister-designate by Stella van Rijn in 
Willemstad; date not given: "`Antilles Will Be Straightened 
Out' -- Netherlands Can Expect `Some Reliability' From New Prime 
Minister Pourier"] 
  [Excerpts] The Antilles have often made agreements just to 
get the Netherlands to stop applying pressure. But that will 
change, according to Miguel Pourier, who is to become prime 
minister next week. He wants to do his utmost to get things 
straightened out so that Netherlands solutions for Antillean 
problems are no longer necessary. 
  "The big change for me came after the referendum. It took me 
days to get used to the idea, but after the results I realized I 
could not get out of going back into politics," said Miguel 
Pourier (54). In a week, he will take over as prime minister of 
the Netherlands Antilles. It is a return for the former 
minister, former interim prime minister and former banker, who 
had in fact been planning to take things at a more leisurely 
pace. Now he has set himself the task of leading the Antilles 
into a new era: That of an efficient and business-like 
government culture, not just internally, but also in relation to 
the Netherlands. 
  In the meantime Pourier is aware that a difficult task is 
awaiting him. He acknowledges that his personality -- he is 
known as honest, friendly, and open -- is the big factor behind 
the success of the Antillean Restructuring Party (PAR), once a 
movement and now a party. The hopes of most of the Antillean 
people are in Pourier personally. [passage omitted] 
  "Our goal is to make autonomy here complete," he said. "We 
will put all, absolutely all our energy into getting things 
straightened out; that applies to every island and every 
organization in the government field. We will work very hard on 
that and we do not want to see a lecturing finger wagging in our 
direction from the Netherlands. I believe that in the kingdom 
we must deal with one another as truly equal partners." Neither 
does he expect any opposition from the Netherlands. "They can 
expect some reliability from me," he said. "No mess, but a 
well-ordered household. The people also expect that of us. How 
could the Netherlands disagree with that?" 
  In recent years the relationship has not been so harmonious, 
as Pourier knows. "Things went wrong on both sides," he said. 
"We often made agreements simply to stop being pressured by the 
Netherlands, but once we came home we just forgot about them. We 
often did not solve our problems ourselves. The Netherlands then 
started to think: We will do it, but that brings other problems 
in its wake. Netherlands standards and solutions were put 
forward for Antillean problems." 
  There is no doubt that the biggest challenge facing the 
Pourier cabinet is finally achieving a new political structure 
after 10 years of interminable talking and arguing. Pourier 
thinks he will have everything ready in a year's time. He sees 
the restructuring as a purely political-administrative problem 
and a question of mentality. "Politicians from the various 
islands were used to just tending their own garden," he said. 
"Everyone followed their own course on their island and felt 
they were the supreme authority there." 
  Pourier wants to put an end to the polarization which 
developed in that way. "Politics is alienated from the people," 
he said. The individual gardens were a problem "because 
everyone has a brother or sister in another garden. For example, 
on St. Martin, there are more people entitled to vote from 
Curacao and Bonaire than from St. Martin itself." Pourier sees 
it as a collective task to get the best for the islands and the 
Antilles as a whole. "With respect for each other's views," he 
said. "If an island, in spite of the possibility of 
cooperation, nevertheless prefers to go on independently, then 
we would respect that." 
  Pourier is still leader of his party and will soon be leader 
of the government, but he will soon transfer the leadership of 
his party. Just three months after it was set up, the PAR is to 
be restructured. Pourier sees danger in his party's 
overwhelming election success. "Anything which arises so 
suddenly brings problems with it," he said. "I also know that 
some people have joined the PAR out of opportunistic reasons, 
they see a profit in it. But these people will be disappointed 
because we are in fact trying to break with the traditional way 
of doing politics, with doing favors, patronage and corruption." 
  The next prime minister does not want to manage everything 
alone. "I think we must act in an educated manner and teach the 
people to be responsible themselves," he said. "That applies to 
families, school boards, trade unions and business, everyone has 
a job. When these responsibilities exceed people's individual 
abilities, then there is space for the government to help. So 
that the help goes where help is really needed." 
  Pourier and his family see the coming prime ministership as 
a 
sort of mission. "It is clear I plays an important role, I could 
not avoid that," he said. "But after 31 years on the front line, 
I wanted to take things more easily. I used to work just five or 
six hours a day and earned between 300,000 and 400,000 a year. 
Now I am going to work 14 hours a day and lead a very busy life 
for a relatively small income."

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] This morning, UN Observers for El Salvador [Onusal] 
presented Venezuelan Enrique Ter Horst, the new Onusal chief who 
will take office on 1 April. Current Onusal Chief Augusto 
Ramirez Ocampo, who has headed the delegation since March 1993, 
stressed that he is leaving El Salvador convinced that democracy 
will continue moving irreversibly forward. According to the 
peace agreements, the only pending issue concerns the full 
deployment of the National Civilian Police [PNC], scheduled for 
22 September, and the dissolution of the current National Police 
on 31 October at the latest. In addition, Ramirez said that 
although there were delays in the land transfer process, it has 
been expedited in the past few weeks, as well as the 
indemnification for former fighters of the Armed Forces. 
  [Begin Ocampo recording] To bid farewell, I have only words 
of gratitude for the Salvadoran people who accepted me with 
generosity, kindness, and cooperation. I must thank President 
Alfredo Cristiani and his government, which I believe has 
reached continental status, for promoting as successful a peace 
process as the Salvadoran peace process. I also want to praise 
the cooperation of and the work done by the Political Committee, 
headed by Coordinator Jorge Shafik Handal, of the FMLN 
[Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front]. It has proven that 
it is deeply committed to peace. This is why I am leaving with a 
clear conscience and with the sense of having accomplished the 
duties and mission assigned. I could predict that peace has 
indeed irreversibly rooted in this country. The parameters that 
shook our America for so many decades have been successfully 
overcome in El Salvador. The dedication, effort, commitment, and 
spirit of dialogue, which prevailed not only during the 28 
months of negotiations that were so complex and difficult, in 
search of such agreements, have followed a similar trend after 
the Chapultepec agreement. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, new Onusal Chief Ter Horst pointed out that he 
already held significant talks with the presidential candidates, 
who will participate in a virtual run-off election, and with 
President Cristiani. They have all promised to comply with the 
agreements that are still pending in El Salvador. His stay in 
the country will be significant not only because of his personal 
experience, but because of the political and diplomatic 
experience he will gain as Onusal chief.

  [Text] According to an Armed Forces plan presented to the 
Congressional Defense Commission yesterday, President Carlos 
Roberto Reina's promise to change military service from an 
obligatory basis to a voluntary and educational basis will cost 
approximately 180 million lempiras. Army Commander General 
Guillermo Paredes Hernandez revealed that studies show that to 
make military service attractive and appealing one need lots of 
money -- approximately 180 million lempiras. He explained that 
new battalions will not be formed, and the present ones one will 
continue to be used. Perhaps, though, some reforms will be 
implemented. He made it clear, however, that this is not 
definite. 
  When asked if Armed Forces Commander General Luis Alonso 
Discua Elvir's statement "voluntarily -- only to the movies" 
denoted a confrontation between the civilian and military 
powers, Paredes said that there is no confrontation nor any 
intention to begin one. "On the contrary, we came here to 
promote a civilized, high-level dialogue so that together we can 
all make the correct recommendations. Moreover, we are setting a 
precedent and an example for the rest of society: that we can 
find the correct solutions to all the problems we face if we 
cooperate, discuss, and talk things over with one another," he 
pointed out. 
  Paredes recalled the problem the Armed Forces are currently 
facing with regard to the number of soldiers. The law stipulates 
that all soldiers who have served two years must be discharged, 
and the number of new recruits does not equal the number of 
soldiers currently in the barracks. Paredes explained that 
during the meeting he presented a study dealing with a large 
number of issues, including the budget increase that would be 
necessary to implement the plan. "The Army is engaged in such 
tasks as fighting forest fires and patrolling the borders where 
international armed groups, who often surpass the capabilities 
of the police, are present," he said. "We are used in these 
tasks and others, like the war against drug trafficking. Among 
other things, we are now getting ready to provide security while 
many people travel outside the city for the weekend," he 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Fernando Naranjo, foreign </F>
minister-designate in the government of President-elect Jose 
Maria Figueres Olsen, by Jose Alberto Briceno; place and date 
not given -- part one of two] 
  [Text] His cold, fixed, unbending, intelligent look reveals 
he is well aware of his mission. He knows the procedures of 
protocol and the details regarding a meeting with ambassadors. 
  If there is one thing of which Fernando Naranjo, the 
incoming 
foreign minister, is sure, it is that the world has changed and 
the country needs a foreign minister with qualities of 
leadership in all areas of foreign policy. "That is my 
mission," he said flatly. 
  The former executive president of the Costa Rican Social 
Security Fund (CCSS) and treasury minister has spoken with LA 
REPUBLICA in his office at the State University for 
Nontraditional Studies (UNED) in Sabanilla de Montes de Oca. 
  With a characteristic of calm, he began our conversation. He 
first explained the main reason why the president selected an 
economist as foreign minister. 
  During the Cold War, he said, diplomacy and politics were 
the 
main part of foreign policy, adding "today's world is very 
different than the past. The future brings us very significant 
challenges." 
  "In addition to maintaining a firm position in defense of 
democracy, civil coexistence, and human rights, there is a new 
trend to follow," he said. "The mission of foreign policy now 
must better respond to the needs of national development." 
  He announced the Foreign Ministry will become a support 
agency, coordinating the work in foreign trade and with 
international financial institutions. 
  According to Naranjo, the exciting thing about his work lies 
in the fact he will be a part of the new type of international 
diplomacy. "Organizations and agencies are becoming more 
flexible. The 1980's were a decade of structural adjustments, 
with a highly economized perspective. The 1990's leave these 
structures behind to explore with more global ties," he said. 
  The job will not only be to aid the process of 
transformation 
in the financial world but also the changes that will arise from 
the creation of economic blocs and commercial opening. 
  To restore the diplomatic corps' role of prominence, Naranjo 
said a team of specialists, whose names he did not disclose, was 
examining closely the applicants who have been presented so far. 
  A second group of experts is examining the names of 
businessmen, people involved in cultural activities, education, 
labor unions, and professional associations who want to occupy 
the various foreign mission posts abroad. The sole purpose of 
this assignment is to "send only the best." 
  These efforts are not limited to the area of personnel 
selection alone. "I am worried our diplomatic installations 
abroad are poorly equipped," he said. "Many do not have a 
facsimile machine or a computer, and communications systems are 
outdated." The second grand mission will be to procure the 
elements the corps will need to do the job properly. 
  The initial expense for these purchases and the salary 
improvements that must be made will come from the cuts to be 
made in the payroll. Each mission will have no more than four 
members. 
  The ministry will create the post of "shuttle ambassador" 
for 
Central Europe and Africa who will visit each country three 
times a year. 
  Regarding payroll distribution, Naranjo said he will make 
every effort to ensure if the ambassador is a politician, the 
second in command will be a specialist in the economic and trade 
fields. 
<H5>  For the Leadership </H5>
  To reach the goals he has set, Naranjo announced the 
creation 
of several new institutions. First he will establish the Human 
Development Agency. This agency, he explains, will coordinate 
more efficiently the international cooperation Costa Rica 
receives and will introduce the country as a model to promote 
regional democracy and human rights. 
  The need for the agency emerged because the cooperation 
currently received "is very fragmented, as many countries help 
us in a variety of sectors. We are going to ask them for more 
cooperation but will attempt to concentrate our efforts to 
specific geographical areas and to channel the cooperation to 
the most depressed places," Naranjo said. 
  Furthermore, it will help open a front of cooperation with 
the remainder of the Central American and Caribbean countries in 
areas where the country has advantages, such as in the fields of 
education, health, environmental protection regulations, and 
telecommunications. "And, of course, in fields where Costa 
Rica, due to its tradition, can help other nations, such as any 
situation related to the democratic system," Naranjo said. 
  Concurrently, a documentary center will be established in 
San 
Jose to gather updated information on Costa Rica's actions in 
the international sphere. The Figueres Olsen administration 
will also establish a diplomatic department to evaluate the work 
done and to help diplomatic missions carry out their assigned 
tasks. 
<H5>  Without Protocol </H5>
  The foreign minister-designate is not ashamed to say he will 
be a "sui generis" foreign minister. "Look at the shirt and 
pants I am wearing now. They are not very elegant," he said and 
smiled when he protested, because he had not been informed a 
photographer would be present at the interview. "Surely, [former 
congressional president] Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto would disown me 
in these clothes," he said. 
  This Pennsylvania University Ph.D. in economics tells us 
unabashedly he will not be a formal foreign minister, rather, a 
functional one who will relate foreign policy to the country's 
internal needs. 
  He admits, however, this is a new activity for him, because 
he has never been in the diplomatic world before. "This is not 
the first time I accept the challenge of working in a field 
different to my speciality. In 1976 President Daniel Oduber 
appointed me executive president of the CCSS [Costa Rican Social 
Security Institute], the country's biggest and most complicated 
institution, because it renders health services," he said. 
  Naranjo was graduated with honors from the University of 
Costa Rica and has taught there for 30 years. He said he has 
traveled extensively and one thing that particularly caught his 
attention was the fact that countries poorer than Costa Rica 
have a more professional, better-equipped diplomatic service, 
and their foreign policy is more defined. His observations 
caused him to think much could be done to further this sector.

  [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force's [FELCN] report has 
provoked a political storm. The report mercilessly tarnished the 
image of former President Jaime Paz Zamora and important 
Movement of the Revolutionary Left [MIR] leaders. As a result, 
Jaime Paz Zamora announced his undeclinable withdrawal from 
political life. 
  The population was surprised by the FELCN report's summary 
of 
conclusions. It obviously had the sharp advise of intelligent 
experts and probably the DEA itself. 
  The document says drug trafficker and Army Captain Isaac Oso 
Chavarria, who was trained as an intelligence officer by the 
Army, used his personal relations with Jaime Paz Zamora and his 
family to create a drug trafficking network within Paz Zamora's 
administration. The MIR leaders involved tried to hide their 
links with Chavarria when the real nature of Chavarria's 
business became known, but Chavarria used that fear to blackmail 
them, the document says. 
  These MIR leaders were involved in illegal activities to 
protect Chavarria against FELCN efforts to uncover his 
activities. Chavarria had legal immunity until the advent of the 
new government. 
  The report says that Chavarria's links with MIR leaders were 
financial as well as personal. Chavarria was a MIR follower and 
had easy access to MIR leaders. We must point out that these 
links were not established by the MIR as a party and most MIR 
followers were unaware of them, the report says, adding that the 
evidence does not incriminate the MIR as a party in Chavarria's 
activities. The MIR cannot be accused of involvement in drug 
trafficking activities. When the report mentions the MIR and its 
links with Chavarria it only refers to the party leadership, the 
document says. 
  When studying the chronology of events, it is clear that MIR 
leaders were willing to accept Chavarria's hospitality, 
financial infrastructure, and resources even before Paz Zamora 
was elected president. Once in power this relationship 
continued, although in a more discreet manner, because MIR 
leaders realized they were politically dangerous, particularly 
after then-Senator Juan Lucio's revelations. 
  During the MIR administration, Chavarria and other drug 
traffickers continued paying bribe money to high-ranking MIR 
leaders, the document says. The bribes were delivered through 
middlemen such as Chavarria employees Edgar Fernandez and Luis 
Capobianco. Paz Zamora's sisters presumably also acted as links 
to carry messages and set up meetings between Chavarria and the 
president, the report adds. 
  The report says that in October 1990, MIR leaders and 
presidential personal secretary Susana Seleme, speaking on 
behalf of the president, prevented a FELCN raid on a house owned 
by Chavarria in Ilpavi and in November 1990 ordered FELCN to 
free Edgar Fernandez, thus interrupting the investigation of 
Chavarria's businesses. 
  In April 1991, acting MIR President Oscar Eid paid 
Chavarria's hospital bills. At that time Chavarria had enough 
money not only to pay his hospital bill but also to buy the 
entire hospital, the report says. 
  In February 1994, MIR leaders threatened fugitive Edgar 
Fernandez' family members to prevent him from revealing anything 
about MIR leaders' links to Chavarria. The report says Chavarria 
conspired to create a drug trafficking network within Paz 
Zamora's administration. The most notable expression of 
Chavarria's influence was the appointment of Colonel Faustino 
Rico Toro to head FELCN. With that appointment Chavarria 
intended to control and neutralize FELCN's struggle against drug 
trafficking. The report says Chavarria considered Faustino Rico 
Toro a drug trafficking partner by at least 1983. 
  The report says Chavarria allegedly pressured President Paz 
Zamora into appointing Rico Toro to the very important and 
delicate post in February 1991. The appointment completed the 
narco-influence network established by Chavarria that included 
presidential aides chief Colonel Jorge Coco Velazquez and Seized 
Goods Director Choco Saucedo. 
  In 1983, Chavarria deposited $1.2 million in a Rico Toro 
account. The two were partners at least as of that date. The 
same year Chavarria purchased Rico Toro's condominium in 
Florida, in the United States. Chavarria received a house that 
belonged to Rico Toro in Ilpadi, La Paz, as payment for a drug 
trafficking debt. Rico Toro tried to repurchase the house when 
he was named FELCN chief, but Chavarria refused to sell it back 
to him. 
  Rico Toro was one of [former military dictator] Luis Garcia 
Meza's assistants. He received $200,000 for his loyalty to the 
regime. The report says Chavarria tried to influence the 
appointment of military officers to important positions through 
presidential aides chief Col. Jorge Coco Velazquez. 
  The report concludes that Seized Goods Director Choco 
Saucedo 
was part of Chavarria's drug trafficking influence network. 
Saucedo sold confidential information on investigations of the 
activities of Colombian drug traffickers to Bolivian drug 
traffickers.

<F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro in Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco yesterday announced that he 
does not intend to prolong the crisis that erupted among the 
three branches of government if the Federal Supreme Court (STF) 
upholds a petition for an injunction filed by the Union of 
Legislative Employees (Sindilegis) against the government. 
Presidential spokesman Fernando Costa said the government will 
comply with any STF ruling on the matter. He noted, however, 
that a ruling against the government would undermine the chances 
of success of the economic stabilization plan launched by 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
  Sindilegis filed a petition for an injunction to force the 
government to transfer the funds required to cover the 10.94 
percent increase obtained by the judicial branch and by Congress 
by converting their salaries to URV's [Real Value Units] on the 
20th instead on the 30th of each month. The government wants 
all salaries to be converted into URV's on the 30th. According 
to the spokesman, if the STF does not pass a ruling on the case 
by 30 March, the government will reissue Provisional Measure 
434, which created the URV and set up guidelines for converting 
salaries into URV's. 
  Franco's major concern now is that an STF ruling in favor of 
Sindilegis could encourage other public servants to file similar 
petitions demanding a 10.94 percent increase. In this case, the 
spokesman said, the government will face serious difficulties 
because it would not have sufficient funds to cover these salary 
increases. Executive branch employees' salaries are converted 
into URV's on the 30th. Ambiguities in Provisional Measure 434 
and different interpretations of the law have caused the STF to 
follow another formula for converting its salaries into URV's, 
thus provoking an impasse. 
  Congress, the government, and the STF have until 30 March, 
when the 30-day period following the issuance of the provisional 
measure expires, to reach an agreement to end this 
confrontation. For instance, Congress may rule that a 
provisional measure establishing that salaries must be converted 
into URV'S on the 30th applies not only to the executive branch 
but to the legislative and judicial branches as well. This 
solution would preclude a re-issuance of the measure by the 
executive branch.

  [Text] Santiago, 28 Mar (EFE) -- Enrico Gimelli, president 
of the Italian Government firm Alenia, has said that Italian 
companies are trying to recover their presence in Chile, which 
was lost after the September 1973 coup that installed a military 
regime that remained for almost 17 years. 
  Gimelli was one of the foreign executives invited to the 
Eighth International Aerospace Fair (FIDAE) in Santiago, which 
closed on 27 March. Delegations from 33 countries attended the 
fair. 
  In today's issue EL MERCURIO published Gimelli's comments 
that the Italian presence at FIDAE was considerable, because 
Italy wanted to show its interest in participating in the 
modernization process of the Chilean Armed Forces. 
  Gimelli was optimistic about future cooperation with the 
Chilean Armed Forces. Regarding the military fields in which 
Alenia works, he said his company could cooperate in systems for 
strengthening naval units, in changing radar systems, and in air 
defense. 
  He added that the best way to invest in Chile is to 
manufacture in cooperation with Chilean companies, in the way 
his company has done in Spain, the United States, and in other 
countries for a long time. 
  He indicated that the level of economic growth and the 
responsibility of Chilean businessmen convey trust. He added: 
"The idea is to exchange our products again. Coming to FIDAE 
was the first step." 
  Alenia is carrying out several technological projects in 
South America, such as construction of the Argentine satellite 
"Nahuel," which will control all communications in that country. 
  Alenia is also working on the "Global Star" system, which 
will interconnect all the world's cellular telephones, while in 
the military sector it produces anti-air systems; radar for 
ships, aircraft, and airplanes; satellites; and helicopters, 
among other military products.

  [Text] Quito, 28 Mar (DPA) -- After an aggressive 
confrontation, filled with accusations and criminal actions, 
between the government and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] 
of Ecuador, a number of talks began today to summon a plebiscite 
on constitutional reforms. The new date was set for 22 May. 
  Carlos Larreategui, minister secretary general of public 
administration, confirmed that the talks will end this week with 
an official call to hold a plebiscite and said that "at least 
there seems to be an agreement on the date." 
  The administration of President Sixto Duran-Ballen proposed 
the plebiscite, made up of eight questions on the political 
regime, but the TSE, controlled by the opposition, refused to 
make the official call for legal and logistical reasons. This 
situation prompted a serious internal conflict. 
  The government emphasized today that the eight questions are 
irrevocable, but it admitted that the plebiscite will not be 
held on 1 May at the same time as the elections to renew 85 
percent of the National Congress, as it was originally planned. 
Larreategui added that "22 May seems to be the right time." 
  The criminal actions filed against the five TSE nonvoting 
members who called off the plebiscite were "frozen" to embark on 
a dialogue, which began today hours before the return of 
Duran-Ballen, who just ended a 16-day visit to Japan, China, and 
the United States. The criminal actions included a petition for 
the precautionary arrest of the five TSE nonvoting members. 
According to the government, these arrests would not have 
hindered the May elections, whose campaign is fully under way. 
  Polls reveal that the two parties that support the Liberal 
Duran-Ballen administration will probably suffer an overwhelming 
defeat in the elections and the hard rightist opposition will 
win by an ample margin.

  [Text] By three votes to one, the First Chamber of the 
Appeals Court has issued the final ruling on the case involving 
Basques. It upheld the extradition of Jesus Maria Lizarralde 
Izaguirre, who was indicted for causing damage and destruction, 
illegal association, and illegally taking hostages. 
  Uruguayan justice has thus granted three extraditions to its 
Spanish counterpart. 
  The Basques who will be extradited are: Jesus Maria 
Lizarralde -- whose extradition was granted yesterday -- Jesus 
Goitia Unzurrunzaga, and Mike Ibanez Oteiza, all of whom are in 
custody at the Central Police Precinct jail. 
  The extradition requests on Pedro Maria Gomez, Jesus Lariz, 
Juan Jose Urrutia, and Amaia Araqustain, was rejected by a 
hearing court and upheld by the Appeals Court. 
  By three votes to one, the Appeals Court rejected Mirem 
Argutzane Delgado Iriondo's extradition, thus overturning a 
ruling by a hearing court. They were released. 
  The extradition of the three Basques who have been charged 
by 
the Spanish Government with belonging to the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] will not take place right now since they 
-- together with the other five who have been released -- have 
pending lawsuits under way here for the use of false documents. 
  Sources close to the Spanish Government last week linked the 
extradition of the Basques with the suspension of King Juan 
Carlos and Queen Sofia's state visit to Uruguay, which gave rise 
to contradictory reports. 
  Asuncion Valdes, the spokesperson of the royal household in 
Madrid, said the invitation to King Juan Carlos de Borbon and 
Queen Sofia to visit Montevideo "has been accepted." 
  Sources close to the Spanish Government and to the Spanish 
Embassy in Montevideo contended previously that Their Majesties' 
visit to Uruguay had been suspended over the stance adopted by 
Uruguayan justice. Carlos Conde Duque, director general of the 
Spanish Police, came to our country several weeks ago to meet 
with Interior Ministry officials. 
  Sources noted that Conde's visit demonstrated that the 
Spanish Government wishes to continue its good relations with 
Uruguay, but that it accomplished very little toward settling 
the requested extraditions. 
  The rejection of the Basques' extradition last year led to 
an 
exchange of letters between governments. 
  Spain lodged a protest about the rejection. This provoked a 
strong response by the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry, which 
underscored the independence of the judicial branch to settle 
this issue.

<F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Enrique Salas Romer, Carabobo State governor, has 
requested support from the various parliamentary wings so that 
the Chamber of Deputies will label as urgent the draft law for 
reforming the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors. 
Raina Rondon reports from Congress. 
  [Begin recording] [Rondon] In the afternoon, Governor Salas 
Romer already had the support of the Democratic Action [AD], 
Copei [Social Christian Party], and MAS [Movement Toward 
Socialism parliamentary wings], support he feels guarantees the 
draft reform will be submitted to Congress within the next few 
days. 
  [Salas Romer] Based on Article 22 of the Constitution--which 
establishes that Congress will issue a law on the election and 
removal of governors--it is possible to establish the conditions 
within which one could go to the extreme of dismissing the 
governor. 
  [Rondon] Meanwhile, Antonio Ledezma has announced Congress 
decided during the session to declare the health sector in a 
state of emergency due to the serious hospital crisis prevailing 
throughout the country and the doctors' conflict. 
  Gustavo Tarre Briceno, chairman of the lower chamber Finance 
Commission said Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom made a 
mistake when he said the Executive Branch would be willing to 
study a draft of a special powers law which will include 
mechanisms for resolving national social and administrative 
issues inasmuch as the Constitution establishes that special 
powers may only include economic and financial issues. 
  [Tarre Briceno] The government had not asked for anything up 
to now. AD comes and makes an offer. The executive branch, 
rather than accepting or rejecting that offer, now proposes, via 
the interior minister, more special powers to include 
administrative and social issues, which is evidently against the 
Constitution. 
  [Rondon] To conclude, Gustavo Tarre Briceno said Congress is 
only waiting for the executive branch to decide what it wants 
regarding the Special Powers law. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 28 Mar (DPA) -- Today, the Mexico City 
press reported the Mexican police have arrested and interrogated 
an alleged collaborator of Mario Aburto Martinez, the confessed 
assassin of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who appears in a video opening 
the way for Aburto to shoot at the presidential candidate at 
point-blank range. According to reports coming from Tijuana 
where the murder took place last Wednesday, this man is 
Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas who was allegedly hired by the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as a member of 
the candidate's security corps. Colosio was murdered last 
Wednesday at the end of an election rally held in Lomas 
Taurinas, a neighborhood in northern Tijuana, on the border. 
  The video, filmed by an amateur and disseminated today by 
Televisa, first shows Sanchez Venegas getting close to the 
candidate and later opening the way for Aburto Martinez. In the 
video, one can see how the assassin raises his arm and puts the 
Taurus .38 caliber just a few centimeters from Colosio's right 
temple, as well as the blast at the moment of the shooting. 
This is the first direct image of the homicide, which even 
registers the exact hour of the shooting, 1912 Mexico City time 
(0112 GMT). 
  Quoting sources close to the investigation, the daily 
EXCELSIOR said, however, that Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas denied 
any link to the attack and pointed out that the fact he was 
there next to Aburto Martinez is a mere "coincidence." Two 
other persons arrested on the day of the murder as witnesses, 
Vicente Mayoral and Jose Antonio Sanchez Ortega, were released 
24 hours after the murder. 
  The Attorney General's Office [PGR] denied reports to the 
effect that Sanchez Ortega tested "positive" in the so-called 
"paraffin test," conducted immediately after the murder to 
determine if he had fired any weapon. The police also arrested 
several relatives and people close to the confessed killer, 
including his mother, Maria Luisa Martinez, and his sisters 
Elizabeth and Karina, ages 17 and 9, the press said today, 
adding that their whereabouts are unknown. 
  According to the PGR, there was only one man, Aburto 
Martinez, and only one weapon, the Taurus .38 caliber gun, 
involved in the attack, but political circles and the local 
media do not rule out a plot. Investigations are now under 
Special Prosecutor Miguel Montes, whose appointment has been 
challenged by the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution 
(PRD), who believe that Montes' pro-government affiliation does 
not guarantee the impartiality necessary for arriving at the 
truth.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The U.S. Pentagon keeps offensive war materiel near 
Cuba. The naval base in Guantanamo illegally occupied by 
Washington, located in the eastern part of the island, is not 
the only source of aggression. 
  The Cuban Parliament's International Relations Department 
has 
issued a report on the extent of U.S. military strength 
maintained near the island of Cuba. The document, publicized by 
PRENSA LATINA, notes that Cuba endures a partial military 
blockade and that the decision to restore the U.S. Homestead Air 
Force Base in Florida is an important part of this. In addition 
to this installation, which has been refurbished after being 
razed by a hurricane, there is an increased presence of 
airplanes and growing air and naval activities in Key West, only 
180 km from Cuba. 
  On the pretext of closely following the crisis in Haiti, the 
Pentagon deployed approximately 60 warships near Cuba's eastern 
tip. During the first two months of 1993 [year as heard] there 
has been increased military surveillance of the island. 
  The U.S. military deployment near Cuba has been going on 
since the triumph of the Revolution. But it is strange that it 
has continued in spite of the events that climaxed in the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. The allegation that Cuba 
represented a threat because Moscow has become as anachronistic 
as the economic blockade, which Washington also maintains in 
spite of much criticism from both within and outside the United 
States. 
  Well-known analysts have recommended an easing of the 
military pressure on Cuba. One of these is (Donald Shultz), a 
national security policy scholar who lectures at the Strategic 
Studies Institute of the U.S. Army's War College. Last year, an 
inter-American magazine that researches global affairs published 
an article in which (Shultz) recommends that the White House 
distance itself from extremist elements of the Cuban immigrant 
community and promote measures, even military measures, that 
display trust. (Shultz') advice has gone unheeded, at least as 
far as the Pentagon is concerned. The same is true of the 
economic blockade, which has been sustained and toughened, in 
spite of growing criticism. 
  No wonder a Cuban parliamentary commission recently declared 
that the way to resolve differences with the United States is to 
create external conditions conducive to the freehanded 
realization of the Cubans' social model.

  [Text] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, elected secretary 
general of the OAS, will have to effect change in this 
organization which, according to observers, no longer has any 
excuse for not attacking the continent's serious problems. 
  In the opinion of Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, 
Gaviria will have to turn the OAS into a more pragmatic 
organization that spends less time making statements; an 
organization that will be able, for example, to attack extreme 
poverty and to make international solidarity a reality. 
  According to the experts, it will fall to Gaviria not only 
to 
devote himself to consolidating democracy on the continent but, 
especially, to leading American integration. The analysts point 
out that it is in connection with Cuba, however, that Gaviria 
could contribute something new to the OAS. They remember that 
Colombia is one of the American countries that has maintained 
the best relations with Cuba in recent years, even with 
formerally ruptured diplomatic ties, and it has gone so far as 
to negotiate the sale of oil to the island in defiance of the 
U.S. embargo. According to observers, for these reasons, from 
his new position in the OAS and with his excellent contacts with 
the United States, Gaviria is in an excellent position to build 
bridges toward the Cuban Government and perhaps achieve Cuba's 
reincorporation into the Pan-American system.

  [Text] The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO has apologized to 
Cuba, a bishop, and its readers for printing false information 
about the Cuban Government and the religious leader, who 
allegedly attended a summit with Colombian guerrillas. The 
newspaper claims it was the victim of a obscure intended set-up, 
the mastermind and objective of which still have not been 
identified. 
  The Colombian newspaper admitted that a professional and 
serious examination of the sources, reconfirmation of the data, 
and a confrontation with those affected would have unmasked the 
sources and prevented the publication of false information. El 
TIEMPO also points out the falsehood of Colombian Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff's statements, which gave the 
information an apparent credibility. The Cuban Government and 
the highest Colombian authorities promptly and repeatedly denied 
Havana's involvement with the alleged so-called guerrilla 
summit. The newspaper goes on to say that the legal editor and 
the head of the editorial staff have tendered their resignations.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Pasquini: "Alert and Vigilant"] </F>
  [Text] Confidential sources have told PAGINA/12 that the 
national government has asked the military intelligence services 
to evaluate the political and social situation in Jujuy 
Province. This confirms that President Carlos Menem is 
resorting to the Armed Forces to control the people's mood. 
Intervention in Jujuy has been on the official agenda for more 
than a week: Intelligence evaluations confirm the existence of 
the basic factors for a social outbreak in that province. 
  Jujuy was the main item on the agenda at the latest weekly 
meeting of the intelligence service chiefs at the Armed Forces 
Joint Command headquarters. The meeting was not held by 
coincidence: The main role is being played by the Army, Navy, 
and Air Force intelligence services despite the presence of 
Secretariat for State Intelligence (SIDE) chief Hugo Anzorreguy 
and the National Border Police and the National Prefecture 
intelligence chiefs. Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf chairs 
the meeting on behalf of the government. 
  The evaluations show that Jujuy has all the symptoms of an 
impending social outbreak and the national government is not 
about to endure another situation like that in Santiago del 
Estero. Beside sending former Deputy Luis "Quito" Martinez as a 
political auditor, the government will reportedly send new 
emissaries: There is talk of sending an Interior Ministry 
official and several Economy Ministry officials, but it is not 
clear if their mission will be to help the administration of 
Peronist Governor Carlos Ficoseco or to study the need for a 
future intervention. 
  Ficoseco is confronting the provincial legislature which 
approved a 50 percent salary increase for public employees. 
Ficoseco is in a difficult situation: If he vetoes the 
increase, the demonstration by the Front of State Workers Union 
scheduled for 29 March could become a repeat of the Santiago del 
Estero drama; if he approves it, the fiscal program will 
collapse. 
  In addition to popular discontent and the political crisis, 
there is the suspicion of generalized corruption. Among the 
intelligence reports are allegations -- impossible to prove -- 
of bribes as high as 50,000 pesos per legislator to vote for the 
Fiscal Pact. These bribes were reportedly paid in 10 
installments of 5,000 pesos. This situation reportedly resulted 
in conflict when on 10 December 1993 the legislative branch was 
renewed and the new legislators demanded similar treatment while 
the outgoing ones demanded payment of the outstanding payments. 
The report, whether true or not, would be laughable if it were 
not staged with an extremely serious social situation as its 
backdrop. 
  Whatever the outcome of the Jujuy crisis, the case confirms 
that the executive branch has decided to charge the Armed Forces 
with the overseeing the mood of the civilian population. 
Government officials this week denied the possibility of 
changing the Defense and Interior Security Laws to legalize this 
situation: they seem to prefer the illegal method. 
  This situation is so real that members of the Armed Forces 
disseminated on 25 March a false version to cover their 
activities: They told the media that the government had asked 
for information on criminal gangs that include former military 
members operating in the great Buenos Aires area. Perhaps this 
same story will be used by the intelligence services chiefs who 
will be summoned by Congress to explain the situation, but it is 
far from the truth. Military sources consulted by PAGINA/12 
explained in simple terms the meaning of the new military role. 
  One high military officer told this daily: "The president 
cannot permit a repetition of what happened in Santiago del 
Estero, when nobody informed him that the provincial government 
was stealing, that public employees were furious, and that the 
provincial police were unwilling to do anything about it. One 
should not make a myth of the word `intelligence.' The 
president wants information on the social situation, he wants to 
know what is happening among the people. He wants the 120th 
Battalion to tell him if public employees want to burn 
everything down." What governor would not like the concurrence 
of the military chiefs? 
  Army and Navy sources told this daily that their 
intelligence 
services were basically dismantled years ago. One source said: 
"We dismantled the internal network in 1983 and 1984. It is 
easier than one thinks: Just cut off the money. This is how the 
network of information and civilian agents was dismantled. Many 
became criminals, for example, Maximo Nicoletti, the leader of 
the super gang." 
  The same source said the intelligence services were 
dismantled because "they were a political weapon, always 
involved in skirmishes between Peronists and Radicals, that 
created more problems than results." Other sources have 
suggested that the Armed Forces never gave up their intelligence 
activities. 
  The source added: "Colonel (Jorge) Mina, the chief of the 
Army Intelligence Service, was about to ask for his retirement 
last year because his unit was to have been cut from 2,200 to 
900 men. With this new policy there will be no reduction and 
Mina will almost certainly be promoted to general." He is 
symbolic of the past: his career is enmeshed in the 601st 
Battalion of Army Intelligence, which was one of the most active 
units of the illegal repression during the military 
dictatorship. It is again holding the watch. 
  The Armed Forces have found another way to become involved 
in 
watching over the provinces: The Interior Ministry has asked the 
Armed Forces Joint Command to form a rapid-deployment force to 
repress eventual social outbreaks. 
  This unit comprises members of the National Border Police, 
the Naval Prefecture, and the Federal Police. The idea emerged 
from the Interior Ministry after President Carlos Menem called 
on the cabinet and all security organizations last January to 
implement greater intelligence activities to detect any sign of 
insurrection. 
  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf asked Lieutenant General 
Mario Candido Diaz, the Armed Forces Joint Command chief, for 
technical assistance in preparing a rapid-deployment force. The 
other security organizations view the request with suspicion. 
One member told a reporter: "They will first advise on the 
formation of the force, they will then intervene in the 
preparation of the plan, and this is how they will take over the 
operation." 
  There are practical reasons to support this belief. Under 
the Interior Security Law, the Armed Forces can and must support 
the security organizations in their functions. The 
rapid-deployment forces will probably be transported in military 
planes and will be fed, housed, and receive medical assistance 
in military garrisons. It is not difficult to imagine that an 
officer of the Armed Forces Joint Command will be in charge of 
coordinating the operations. 
  There is also a political reason: Ruckauf may use it to 
overcome Defense Ministry objections to the creation of the 
rapid-deployment force, which it sees just as a way to buy 
weapons and new equipment for the National Border Police and the 
Prefecture. In other words, the Interior Ministry is taking a 
swipe at the Defense Ministry. 
  The meetings of the intelligence services have more 
political 
importance than practical results. An intelligence meeting is 
more like a poker game in which each participant eyes the other 
and measures how they are lying to him and how much he can hide. 
It also serves to communicate the official decision and to 
maintain the military attention. Each service then sends its 
report to the government through its own channels. 
  A general evaluation can be made right there: The Santiago 
del Estero social outbreak -- which coincided with the armed 
insurrection in Chiapas, Mexico -- lead to the president's 
appeal to military intelligence. It has created an unofficial 
manual of pointers from which to determine where an outbreak 
could occur next. The manual states that outbreaks occur when a 
serious social situation -- like the case of public employees 
who did not get their already low salaries -- is followed by a 
political crisis which allows the population to go out of 
control. This is almost an example of Marxist analysis: the 
late Louis Althusser would have written the formula that the 
crisis came when an economic conflict was "intensified" by a 
political conflict. Perhaps the intelligence agents have not 
read it but the provincial governors should start doing it.

  [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Former de facto president, General 
Jorge Rafael Videla, was acquitted yesterday on charges of 
promoting crime filed against the former head of the military 
dictatorship after he had said that the Armed Forces should have 
been paid, instead of having to pay the price for their actions 
during the Dirty War. 
  According to the verdict issued by Judge Fernando Larrain, 
Videla did not intend to make his opinions public because they 
came in the context of a speech made at a dinner last year in 
front of some 50 retired military officers. 
  The complaint had been filed last November by the government 
through the Human Rights Under-Secretary Alicia Pierini after 
Videla's statements were reproduced by Buenos Aires daily 
CLARIN. Government sources yesterday refused to comment on the 
verdict. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Representatives of the 
132 countries attending the First World Telecommunications 
Development Conference today closed it by approving the Buenos 
Aires Action Plan, which will especially favor lesser-developed 
countries. 
  The action plan is one of the most important issues 
discussed 
during the conference, which opened on 21 March in Buenos Aires. 
It includes three great chapters: a cooperation program between 
the most developed members of the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU), an action plan for the 
Telecommunications Development Office (BDT), and a special 
program for the lesser-developed countries. 
  The initial program contains seven clauses: politics, 
strategies and financing; action and development of human 
resources; development plans, network and frequency management 
planning; integrated rural development; radio broadcasting; 
information services; and the application of new technologies 
for development. 
  These clauses are in the second chapter, in addition to 
others which mainly refer to coordinated activities of regional 
and world interest for assisting individual countries. 
  It is expected that they will be complemented with 
multilateral and bilateral projects carried out and supported by 
the BDT and its co-participants in development. 
  The first chapter deals with upcoming development 
conferences. There will be a world conference in 1998 with at 
least two regional meetings before then. 
  A decision was also made to create two commissions to study 
the development of telecommunications. 
  The third chapter contains a special program for 
lesser-developed countries to be financed with resources of the 
ITU, which specifies that both developing and developed 
countries will benefit from the programs. 
  The BDT action plan emphasizes the need to develop 
telematics 
(technology of telecommunications and informatics) and 
electronic networks to support the remaining proposed programs. 
  It also features a program to handle the specific needs of 
those countries with the lowest incomes and levels of services. 
  It is expected that at least 70 percent of the funds of the 
ITU, a specialized UN organization, will be used to support 
activities for lesser-developed countries. 
  The second chapter of the plan, the largest and most 
specific, emphasizes a proposal to "plan frequency management 
networks" and to help the development of communications 
infrastructure in developed countries. 
  Regarding "integrated rural development," the project seeks 
to extend telecommunications with remote rural communities in 
developing countries to cover rural activities such as 
agriculture, education, transportation, and health. 
  The second chapter also proposes a project for "the 
development of telematics and electrical networks" connected in 
the future by "electronic highways" which will allow developing 
countries access to information, education, and training.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Ines Espeche and Ana Gerschenson: "The </F>
Capital Is Jeopardizing the Pact"] 
  [Text] "The direct election of the mayor and the reform of 
Buenos Aires City: 
  "a) The people of the city of Buenos Aires will directly 
elect their chief of government. 
  "b) The city of Buenos Aires will be granted a special 
constitutional status that will recognize its autonomy and its 
own legislative and jurisdictional powers." 
  (From the Basic Points of Agreement of the pact signed in 
Olivos by President Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin) 
  The measures contained in the Olivos pact have already begun 
to unravel. The bone of contention is none other than the 
autonomy of the Federal Capital and its new legal status. 
Apparently, government officials are trying to "block" the legal 
and economic independence of the city and leave alone only the 
direct election of the mayor at the Constituent Assembly in 
Santa Fe. President Menem himself urged the squabbling factions 
in the Buenos Aires Justicialist Party (PJ) to end their 
fighting and put off decisions on the future plan. 
  The "provincialization" of the Federal Capital would 
inevitably bring with it the creation of new local institutions, 
the drafting of a metropolitan constitution, the formation of a 
local police force (the neighborhood precincts would come under 
the jurisdictions of the city), and a new local judiciary, plus 
the possible replacement of the Deliberating Council by a Buenos 
Aires legislature. 
  But what is especially upsetting to more than one sector of 
the national government, particularly the Economy Ministry, is 
that it will not be able to refuse to turn over the lion's share 
of its funds to a new "city state" with full autonomy. 
  No Buenos Aires politician doubts that this is "the debate 
that will come on the heels of the Constituent Assembly." 
  The leaders of the metropolitan PJ who are part of the 
president's inner circle would be willing to tolerate the 
emergence of a "chief of government" elected by popular vote. 
"What they cannot stomach," claim some former Grossists, "is 
that on top of that, the new mayor would have control of the 
huge budget of the new province." 
  Even Carlos Corach, the number-one candidate to represent 
the 
capital at the Constituent Assembly, told LA PRENSA that he does 
not agree with the formation of a metropolitan judiciary or a 
local police force. "That would result in more useless 
bureaucracy," he declared, expressly contradicting the paragraph 
of the Olivos pact that states: "...the city of Buenos Aires 
will be given a constitutional status that will recognize its 
autonomy and its own legislative and jurisdictional powers." 
  "Here it is evading an internal debate within the PJ," says 
Simon Lazara, spokesman for Raul Alfonsin, when asked about the 
possibility that the Radicals' agreement with Menem may fall 
apart. While it is an open secret that within the Buenos Aires 
PJ there is "an internal power struggle between Corach and 
Ruckauf to control the capital," when it comes to the issue of 
the city's autonomy, the minister agrees with the legal and 
technical secretary that "it is not necessary" for the city to 
have its own police and court system. 
  "What they are forgetting," whispers a former Justicialist 
deputy, "is that they will not be ministers or government 
officials for the rest of their lives; they will not last 100 
years." 
  On the other hand, Alfonsinist Jesus Rodriguez, a deputy who 
favors the pact, promised that at the Constituent Assembly "we 
will defend our neighbors, because I do not trust the Menemists 
when they talk about autonomy." 
  This issue, about which the Justicialists have clearly not 
reached a consensus (although they do not admit that in public), 
will be the subject of a meeting next week between the PJ 
deputies and Constituent Assembly candidates, both those in the 
capital and those in Buenos Aires Province. There they will try 
to forge a united position so that there will be no more 
contradictions, at least not in public. 
<H5>  "The Name Is Mine" </H5>
  It should be noted that Governor Eduardo Duhalde recently 
brought up the "identity crisis" that Buenos Aires residents 
would suffer if the city were to keep its current name. It was 
then that he proposed the name "Santa Maria" for its third 
incarnation, after it has achieved full autonomy. 
  "All the patrol cars that used to say `Buenos Aires 
Provincial Police' now say `Buenos Aires Police,' to get people 
used to the idea of Buenos Aires in the district," the 
distressed governor explained to Buenos Aires PJ Deputy Jorge 
Arguello, author of the first autonomy plan for the capital. 
  Despite the "psychological crisis" the residents of the 
metropolitan area may suffer, on this side of General Paz no 
one, Justicialist or Radical, is willing to give up the label 
"Buenos Aires City," which will inevitably set the stage for 
confrontations here and there in the future. 
  Some suspicious types speculate that what really bothers 
Duhalde is "the emergence of a man who will be as strong as he 
is as governor of what until now has been the country's most 
important province." 
  The chief of government, a title agreed upon by the Radical 
Civic Union (UCR) and the PJ, will be politically and 
economically powerful enough to negotiate on an equal footing on 
issues such as the exodus of "the 6 million people who come into 
the capital each day to be treated at Buenos Aires hospitals." 
  To top it all off, Deputy Enrique Benedetti, a De la Rua 
political operative, did not hesitate to give LA PRENSA this 
diagnosis: "This is another `leak' in the pact. First there is 
Levene, who does not want to give up the [Supreme] Court; now we 
have the autonomy issue. The next thing you know, they will say 
that Menem's reelection will not be for one term, but will be 
good for the rest of his biological existence." 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Everyone Wants To Be "Chief of Government" </H5>
  Being elected top leader of the Federal Capital by popular 
vote is the pinnacle of politics for more than one Buenos Aires 
official, regardless of party affiliation. The matter has 
sparked more than one internal feud. 
  The list includes those who secretly yearn for the office, 
as 
well as those who have already announced it loud and clear. 
  Among metropolitan Justicialists, former Grossists and 
Menemists are fighting over the right to be the elected 
"figure"; everyone from recent PJ acquisition Adelina Dalesio de 
Viola to Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan (PAMI) Director 
Matilde Menendez, and including Legal and Technical Secretary 
Carlos Corach, Public Function Secretary Claudia Bello, and 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, wants to take Bouer's place in 
1995. 
  After the recent elections in the capital and the dimming of 
his presidential prospects, Radical insiders say that Senator 
Fernando de la Rua has expressed a desire to wear the mayor's 
sash. But the man who opposed the pact will not have a smooth 
road ahead of him. Alfonsinist Deputy Jesus Rodriguez has 
already secretly begun pulling his political strings to enter 
the race for the same job. 
  The appearance on the scene of Socialist Councilman Norberto 
Laporta, who swept the metropolitan elections last 3 October, 
has dashed more than one private hope. "El Chichon" [the jolly 
one] has reportedly taken the idea so seriously that many say 
this was the real reason why he declined to enter into an 
alliance with the Great Front. "With the race for the city 
leadership so close at hand, he could not risk having his image 
tarnished," Socialists assert with conviction. 
  There is also optimism in the front. The person who emerges 
as the "best of the candidates" is former Prosecutor and 
Councilman Anibal Ibarra. The opinion polls indicate he is a man 
to be reckoned with, especially since he was so instrumental in 
exposing irregularities in the PAMI. 
  Another person rumored to be vying for a position on the 
list 
of possible candidates is retired Brigadier General Osvaldo 
Cacciatore, who made no secret during his unsuccessful campaign 
for deputy as a member of the metropolitan Democratic Center 
Union (UCeDe) that he would like once again to hold the office 
that was once his. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  Third Incarnation </H5>
  A series of legal steps must be taken before the city can be 
declared "autonomous." 

  -  It must be approved by the National Constituent 
Convention. 
  -  After that the second stage will begin, the local 
constituent process, when limits will be set and terms will be 
defined. 
  -  If Article 3, Paragraph 27 of Article 67, and Paragraph 
3 of Article 86 of the National Constitution are amended at the 
convention, the way will be clear to advance toward 
autonomy. 
  -  Until autonomy is declared and the new institutions of 
Buenos Aires City are installed, Congress will continue to be 
the local legislature. 
  -  After the Constitution is amended, 
Congress will pass a law calling an election for delegates to a 
Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly. 
  -  Each party will have to draw 
up a city model to present to the people, set in motion an 
electoral process, elect delegates to the Constituent Assembly, 
draft the constitution of the autonomous city, and once it is 
approved, set in motion the institutional process. 
  -  The 
Deliberative Council will be replaced by a legislature of the 
new city. 
  -  It will have a special constitutional status. 
  -  It will 
continue to be the nation's capital until Congress passes a law 
transferring that status; it may or may not declare the capital 
to be federal. 
  -  Although there is a general consensus on 
autonomy, the debate will begin with what city model each party 
will offer. Moreover, it will have a direct impact on the 
quality of life of the citizens. This is a foundational stage, 
the most important one since the city was federalized in 
1880.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 28 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today expressed his satisfaction 
with the election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS 
secretary general. 
  Paz told Voz de Honduras radio station in a telephone 
interview from Washington that the nomination of Gaviria "we 
believe was the result of a democratic election in which the law 
of the majority prevailed, which is the fundamental law of 
democracy." "Gaviria won as a result, and we believe he is a 
hemispheric leader who will give proper leadership to the OAS," 
he said. The minister added that among the majority of the OAS 
member countries there is "satisfaction," but he also said "the 
feeling of bitterness, especially that of Costa Rican Foreign 
Minister Bernd Niehaus," is logical. 
  Niehaus made an intense but unfortunate effort because in 
democracy there is always a winner and a loser, according to 
Paz, who pointed out that Gaviria defeated the Costa Rican 
foreign minister in the first round 20 votes to 14. 
  Honduras' position on the election of the OAS secretary 
general was to support the Costa Rican candidate, Bernd Niehaus, 
in the first round and Gaviria in the second round. Paz Aguilar 
said that Honduras promised to support a Central American 
candidacy because it "respects the promises that were made;" 
however, he refused to comment on the change of heart of those 
who had pledged their support for Niehaus.

  [Text] Deputies Joseph Fignole Jean-Louis, Duckens Marc 
Desrosiers, and Guerrier Compere have written to U.S. Ambassador 
William Lacy Swing. Here is what their letter says: 
  We, deputies of the 45th Legislature and signers of this 
letter, acknowledge receiving your invitation asking us to join 
you at your residence on 29 March to commemorate the anniversary 
of the Haitian Constitution, under which we were democratically 
elected on 16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 [date as heard] 
and which we swore to respect and to enforce. 
  These deputies add: We formally acknowledge this initiative. 
Unfortunately, we are sorry, but we are obliged to decline your 
invitation for the following reasons: First, the tragic 
conditions under which our people are struggling (?because of) 
the daily violation of this Constitution and its basic rights do 
not encourage us to party. 
  In addition to this, we would like to be in our respective 
districts, with our voters on the occasion of 29 March. The 
authors of the bloody 30 September 1991 coup d'etat, however, 
block any and all steps in this direction with impunity and 
leave the population no choice other than headlong flight by 
thousands of boat people, turned back mercilessly regardless of 
any international treaties; the wandering of hundreds of 
thousands of refugees in desperate straits from the interior; 
and the most complete lack of security, highlighted every day by 
the bodies thrown to the animals, especially in the shantytowns 
and working-class neighborhoods of our cities, write these 
deputies. 
  On the other hand, we make it a point to assure you, Mr. 
Ambassador, that any invitations that could result in a 
worthwhile solution to the current crisis that has caused so 
many disasters and so much mourning will be received eagerly and 
with gratitude. While waiting for such a greatly desired 
occasion to arise, we remain, yours truly, [signatures]. 
  Such was the content of a letter written by Deputies Fignole 
Jean-Louis of the Mirebalais district; Duckens Marc Desrosiers, 
of Hinche; and Guerrier Compere, of Limonade, and sent to U.S. 
Ambassador William Lacy Swing. 
  These are three National Front for Change and Democracy 
parliamentarians who have declined the U.S. ambassador's 
invitation to attend the anniversary of the Haitian Constitution 
commemoration by the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. It must 
also be said that Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] senators 
have also declined Ambassador Swing's invitation in 
Port-au-Prince.

  [Text] With the attendance of Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro and the compiled results of the thousands of assemblies 
that gathered over 3 million workers at the parliaments in the 
work centers, the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] is holding its 
expanded council for the preliminary analysis of this process 
described as unique for its [word indistinct] result. Those were 
the words of Commander in Chief Fidel Castro when he said that 
in no other country of the world has such a situation been 
discussed publicly. He said this process is unprecedented in the 
political history of the world. Castro added: We are the only 
brave ones who dare to do this and to [words indistinct] and 
discuss it in a way that could not be more open. That is the 
reason we must analyze these things before applying any measure; 
the situation is very complex, complicated even for specialists. 
Fidel went on to say: What would our position be if we had all 
the gas or coal we wanted? This is what forces us to seek other 
feasible means. 
  In evaluating the discussions of the work centers, Fidel 
said: The works in these parliaments suggested many wise and 
intelligent ideas. These meetings that were held for the very 
first time. 
  In his report to the national plenum of the CTC summing up 
the process of the parliaments in the work centers, Pedro Ross, 
secretary general of the CTC, pointed out that we have just 
begun and summarized the principal results of the assemblies. 
  Attending the plenum with Commander in Chief Fidel Castro 
are 
members of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, members 
of the Council of Ministers, and the Presidency of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government.

<F P=106> [From the review of the 29 March issue of GRANMA] </F>
  [Excerpt] Good morning to all our listeners. On its front 
page, GRANMA carries remarks by Pedro Ross Leal, who says the 
response to the Parliaments in the Workplace assemblies cannot 
be just explanations but must be solutions. These assemblies sum 
up the workers' political line and the spirit that must be 
implemented, said Ross Leal at the end of the provincial 
assessment of the recommendations that will be submitted to the 
National Assembly [of the People's Government] by the workers 
movement. 
  The national committee of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] 
will meet this afternoon to analyze the ensemble of proposals 
made by Cuban workers throughout the country. 
  Another GRANMA article reports that the Republic of Cuba 
will 
decorate a group of outstanding youngsters from throughout the 
nation. These young people will receive the Order of Julio 
Antonio Mella and the Abel Santamaria and Jose Antonio 
Echeverria medals. This activity is part of the homage paid on 
the 32d and 33d anniversaries, respectively, of the Union of 
Young Communists [UJC] and Jose Marti Pioneers Organization. 
This ceremony will be held in San Pedro, Havana Province, the 
place where Jose Marti died. 
  Also, the objective of the Zambian foreign minister's visit 
to our country at the invitation of his Cuban counterpart is to 
prepare the forthcoming visit to Cuba by Zambia's president and 
to develop ties of cooperation between the two countries.

  [Text] The INTERFAX press agency reported today that the 
Russian Government has reduced the amount of oil earmarked for 
countries of the former Soviet Union in order to send it to 
Cuba. The source added that due to a request by the Russian 
Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, this year, 2.5 million tons 
of oil will be earmarked for Cuba in exchange for 1 million tons 
of sugar, which will serve partially to meet national needs. 
  On 24 December 1993 in Moscow, Russian and Cuban delegations 
agreed to exchange 2.5 million tons of petroleum for 1 million 
tons of sugar through a joint enterprise in charge of carrying 
out the transaction.

  [Text] The second scientific meeting on Latin American 
integration called Inter-Lat-94 began today at the Cienfuegos 
Superior Technical Institute with the participation of 
approximately 100 delegates, among them Mexican and Ecuadoran 
guests. 
  At the opening session, Dr. Eduardo Cruz Gonzalez, dean of 
Cienfuegos University, said the objective of these meetings, the 
second of which is being held here in coordination with the 
Center for Research of World Economy, is to study how 
universities, in the midst of the difficulties daily affecting 
the world, can contribute to maintaining the concept of support 
to the integrationist process in America. 
  Several working groups are analyzing such topics as Latin 
American integration in history; the Latin American university 
in today's world; research on housing; and science, technology, 
and sustainable development. Two important seminars will close 
the international scientific research meeting on integration 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Last week, the Netherlands-Cuba working group held 
its first plenary session. The business delegation, headed by 
(Coy Stork), was interested in contacting Cuban enterprises for 
research, coastal management and shoreline restoration in Cuba 
and the Caribbean, registration and joint operation of Cuban 
ships, construction in third countries, and joint productions in 
the machine tool, food, and textile industries. In exchange, the 
Netherlanders will supply canned milk, meat, fruit, and 
vegetables to Cuba. 
  In the 1994-95 work program, the group will promote 
possibilities for investment in Cuba and will support the 
efforts of Dutch enterprises established in Havana. The creation 
of joint enterprises and variants of associations of mutual 
benefit and the introduction of the scientific-technical, 
biotechnical, and pharmaceutical industries to the Netherlands 
market were additional aspects considered in the final document, 
which was signed by (Van Vough), head of the Dutch section, and 
Ariel Maso, director of (Cubanique) and head of the Cuban 
section at the meetings.

  [Text] Jaime Crombet, head of the Cuban delegation to the 
91st Inter-Parliamentary Union [IPU] conference and vice 
president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, 
returned to Cuba on 28 March. Upon arriving at Havana's 
international airport, Crombet evaluated that important 
international event. 
  [Begin Crombet recording] The 91st IPU conference held in 
Paris from 21 to 26 March was a big success. There were more 
than 120 foreign parliamentary delegations from all over the 
world and more than 1,000 participants counting both senators 
and deputies, including a U.S. delegation. They arrived a little 
late but they did attend. 
  We can say that a complete consensus was reached regarding 
the environment and the dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes. 
Obviously, following the Rio de Janeiro summit where a universal 
consensus, an international awareness of the need to protect the 
environment was achieved, the whole world is engaged in adopting 
preventive measures against natural disasters and especially 
against the dumping of the most dangerous and toxic wastes. 
  A consensus was also reached regarding the control of 
nuclear 
weapons and the obligations of all countries, those that have 
signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This subject was 
added to the agenda; this was a subject that was added at the 
last minute to the initially prepared agenda, and a good 
document was issued on this matter. 
  The political situation throughout the world was also 
discussed, allowing each country to explain its domestic 
situation. Of course, Cuba also explained the situation in the 
country, the measures being adopted and the development of 
events, pointing out the main positions of other countries and 
stressing the main world events, such as the denunciations of 
the criminal U.S. blockade against our country. Also discussed 
was the role of the United Nations -- as one of the main 
subjects of the conference -- and regional organizations, the 
treatment of regional conflicts, and maintaining peace. Our 
delegation played a very active role in this connection. 
  Of course there were some contradictory positions. While 
certain delegations defended the limited sovereignty theory, 
others accepted the theory of humanitarian action without the 
previous consent of the parties. For us, this is a [word 
indistinct] principle, that is, the primary principle is that of 
nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other countries; 
therefore, the two parties' willingness to accept the 
intervention of UN forces is imperative, even though such 
intervention might fall under the veil of humanitarian action. 
  After strong confrontations, Cuba established its position, 
a 
position that was very clear, and also the need to democratize 
the United Nations and reform the UN Security Council based on 
the agreement of all the chiefs of state from the Americas and 
on the last summit, which was held in Salvador, Bahia [Brazil].

  [Text] The main agreement of the provincial plenum 
committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Santiago de 
Cuba has been able to achieve the maximum effort toward a good 
conclusion of the sugar harvest. 
  This meeting, which was chaired by Esteban Lazo Hernandez, 
Politburo member and first secretary of the PCC's Santiago de 
Cuba provincial committee, stressed the need to place greater 
emphasis on the harvest in order to conclude it in the first 
half of May. Thus, the essential objective is to stabilize the 
economy and to gain efficiency at the various plants. Plant 
production in several Santiago de Cuba agroindustrial complexes 
has been below the established plan.

<F P=106> ["Second of a series of interviews" with Lieutenant Colonel </F>
(Octavio Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of the 
Interior Office by police reporter Alemany; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Alemany] Despite the nation's resource limitations 
resulting from this special period, the Cuban Government is 
making tremendous efforts to harvest almost 3 million quintals 
of potatoes, cabbage, garlic, carrots, and other products. 
Special measures have been adopted in Havana Province to see 
that these products reach their destination, that is, the 
population. Thus, checkpoints have been created, and the trucks' 
itineraries are monitored. So far, these measures have yielded 
satisfactory results. 
  [(Geronez)] All these measures being adopted in the fields 
and in monitoring the trucks on their way to the wholesale 
markets have considerably reduced the diversion and illegal sell 
of agricultural products. We want to point out that last year, 
many trucks used to arrive at the markets and packing plants 
with great weight differences. They also used to have great 
document problems, problems that used to facilitate illegal 
activities, and these problems stem directly from illegal 
actions in the fields or while the trucks are circulating. 
  The practical effect of the checkpoints on the roads and the 
new measures we have taken to identify the itineraries has been 
to prevent the truckers from deviating from their itinerary to 
unload part of the cargo in some particular place or to sell 
these products to people who take advantage of these illegal 
actions to acquire a large amount of products so as to to then 
resell them. 
  [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez), in 1993, these 
trucks used to arrive at the packing plants or wholesale markets 
showing a tremendous difference in weight. 
  [(Geronez)] I want to point out that last year, the 
difference in weight when these trucks arrived at the wholesale 
markets or packing plants was so great that we called them gross 
problems or gross differences. Now, since 28 February when we 
began this harvest campaign, we have had no gross differences 
yet as regards the weight of the trucks. There are some problems 
with the documents, but after the investigations we conducted, 
we found out that these problems are not the result of attempted 
criminal actions but rather normal problems that sometimes 
occur, perhaps through ignorance or negligence on the part of 
certain colleagues or perhaps for certain other reasons, but 
they are not the result of evil intentions. 
  [Alemany] All the Interior Ministry's forces are 
participating in the struggle against the theft of agricultural 
products in Havana, and the population is supporting these 
measures. Government officials have also acted severely, to 
punish those conducting illegal business in agriculture with the 
force of the law. 
  [(Geronez)] Well, these measures have helped reduce theft 
considerably. Last year, during the first week of the campaign, 
the incidence of criminality in this connection and the number 
of people tried in the courts was high. This year we have 
conducted a great publicity campaign and people are aware of the 
measures we are adopting. Moreover, the criminals will be 
punished severely, especially for crimes involving these 
agricultural products, which are meant to provide relief for the 
nation and the population during the current crisis. 
  [Alemany] At the same time tomorrow, we will release the 
last 
part of the interview with Lt. Col. (Geronez) concerning the 
measures adopted to prevent the diverting and stealing of 
agricultural products in Havana Province.

  [Text] Given this past weekend's severe outages, the 
Electric Union advises that efforts to repair breakdowns at 
several power plants had already solved some problems by Sunday 
evening. Breakdowns in the generating units of the Talla Piedra 
and Regla power plants in Havana City, the East Havana power 
plant in Santa Cruz del Norte, as well as the Maximo [words 
indistinct] fuel supply to the Diez de Octubre Power Plant in 
Camaguey caused the elevated deficits that affected the early 
morning hours of Saturday and Sunday. The Electric Union told us 
they will return to the regular schedule in each province once 
the generating level has been recovered.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 26 and 29 March. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 26 March reports that 
Guantanamo 
Province has been one of the most outstanding provinces in 
harvest emulation during the period between 11 and 20 March. 
Guantanamo has been cited in 7 of the 14 aspects rated in the 
harvest emulation, and it also intends to increase sugar 
production and fulfill its plan. 
  In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that 
approximately 13,000 low-cost houses will be built in Sancti 
Spiritus Province by 1996 using local resources. This will help 
triple the number of houses built per year in this province, 
which is experiencing a tremendous shortage of energy, cement, 
and steel. Approximately 2,000 houses are under construction, 
most in 40 high-priority zones. 
  Rebelde adds in the same newscast that the U.S. Conference 
of 
Catholic Bishops has donated 7 tons of medicines worth $2.5 
million to Cuba. 
  Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 28 March report 
that Camaguey canecutters are engaged in a campaign to increase 
production and efficiency. In 80 days they cut 2 million arrobas 
of cane and are talking about cutting another million, if 
necessary. 
  In the same newscast, Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision report 
that as the water shortage continues, farmers are resorting to 
old techniques to provide water to their cattle. One said he is 
using a mule to draw water from a deep well for his milk cows 
because bringing in water tanks costs an arm and a leg. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 28 March reports that a new 
system for selling medicines has been implemented with positive 
results in Holguin Province pharmacies. The pharmacies "have 
been linked" to polyclinics and assistance centers, and 
"pharmaceutical products that used to disappear off the shelves 
in a single day now last up to a month....Doctors at polyclinics 
and assistance centers now know daily what products are 
available." 
  In the same newscast, the radio reports that only 326 of the 
6,751 pieces of medical equipment at Matanzas Province 
assistance centers are currently out of service because they are 
broken. This constitutes a praiseworthy achievement by the 
workers of the provincial electromedical technical services 
center. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 March reports that 
specialists and technicians from the Rayonitro enterprise in 
Matanzas are satisfactorily carrying out tests to obtain 
ammonium dicyanate,"a reagent that is of interest in producing 
meningitis vaccine." Rayonitro engineer Damaso Lopez said there 
is currently a plant that "facilitates production of carbon 
bisulphide, which is raw material for processing the reagent in 
question." Rayonitro can currently make, industrially, some 60 
tons per year of carbon bisulphide, considerably reducing the 
amount Cuba has to import. "Carbon bisulphide is a dense, 
transparent, very volatile liquid. Its cost on the world market 
is between $2,000 and 2,500 per ton, while by employing the 
Matanzas technology, its use is facilitated at a cost of just 
500 pesos the ton." 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 28 March reports that the 
oilworkers of Ciego de Avila Province met 105 percent of their 
plan for the extraction of crude oil for the first quarter of 
1994 by extracting 17,373 tons before the deadline. They also 
drilled 5,005 meters instead of the 2,520 established in their 
drilling program. 
  In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that over the 
past two years, 60 caballerias of cacao have been planted with 
hybrid seeds that have a high genetic potential and are 
resistant to environmental adversity. The seeds were produced by 
the cacao research station located in Baracoa Municipality, 
Guantanamo Province, the municipality that produces the greatest 
number of seeds from plants resistant to pests, disease, and bad 
weather. Guantanamo Province produces close to 80 percent of the 
national cacao crop of between 35,000 and 45,000 quintals yearly. 
  Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 28 March reports that tobacco 
enterprises in Pinar del Rio are picking the capa dura leaves 
which are normally discarded during the harvest. They plan to 
use these leaves in domestic cigarettes and cigars. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 29 March reports that up to 26 
March, the sugar agroindustry had planted 2,740 caballerias of 
sugarcane, 80 percent of the amount scheduled for planting by 
the end of this month. The provinces of Camaguey, Havana, 
Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Guantanamo are outstanding in this 
activity. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 29 March reports that the (Juan 
Jose Berdesi) and Jose Maria Perez brigades have cut 2 million 
arrobas of sugarcane, becoming the first to reach this amount 
during the current harvest in Santiago de Cuba Province. 
  Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 29 March reports that 1 million 
quintals of potatoes have been harvested in Havana Province. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 March reports that a fish 
farm in Los Palacios Municipality has successfully bred a 
Chinese variety known as the (fenca china). In the first tests 
in 10 ponds, 6 million eggs were obtained, of which 4.2 million 
hatched. Radio Rebelde also reports that 46 quintals of 
sunflower seeds have been harvested in Cienfuegos to produce 
cooking oil.

<F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega from the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The shots that ended the life of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI] in Mexico, thwarted the plans of a 
young politician who -- everything seems to indicate -- did not 
randomly select the poorest neighborhood in the border city of 
Tijuana to stage a political event in which he would explain his 
main government proposals. No one will ever be able to criticize 
or applaud Colosio in the future because no one will know if the 
words which were virtually his last might have come true: "I 
want to be president because I want to support the most needy in 
my country." 
  Thus far, while the incredible and forever debatable theory 
of a lone assassin makes the rounds, Colosio's death has upset 
Mexico's political panorama, cast a gloomy shadow over Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's administration, and created uncertainty 
regarding who will be the next presidential candidate for the 
party that has been in power for more than 50 years in Mexico. 
  The assassination has shocked the entire world but it has 
devastated Mexico because, emotions aside, it has created an air 
of instability with regard to the 21 August elections when 
approximately 50 million Mexicans will elect a new president 
under turbulent social conditions. 
  Carefully selected, Colosio graduated in 1972 from the 
Monterrey Technological Institute and studied regional 
development and urban economy at the post-graduate level at the 
University of Pennsylvania. He was an academic researcher in 
Austria and in Mexico he taught classes at several institutions. 
After Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office, Colosio was 
appointed president of the PRI, thus becoming one of the party's 
youngest leaders. Colosio was also a senator for Sonora State, 
secretary of urban development and ecology, and later secretary 
of social development, the post he held until he was appointed 
PRI presidential candidate in November, 1993. 
  Colosio's campaign encountered no problems at the outset but 
following the Zapatist National Liberation Army's uprising on 
New Year's day, he was widely criticized by the opposition and 
factions in his own party for his alleged failure to speak out 
against the crisis and because his team of advisers was 
perceived as weak. It has always been said that Manuel Camacho 
Solis, a former Federal District mayor and former foreign 
minister, was Colosio's chief rival. Quite recently, however, 
Camacho publicly relinquished his presidential ambitions, which 
is why the slain PRI candidate seemed to have a clear path to 
the presidency unless another party won. 
  The dramatic void created by Colosio's death has the PRI in 
suspense because it must appoint a new presidential candidate. 
Many people have mentioned Ernesto Zedillo as a possible 
candidate -- totally dismissing Camacho Solis -- a former 
education minister, a brilliant economist, and also a former 
budget minister, [the latter] a position that had been held by 
Mexico's last two presidents, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari prior to their election. Nevertheless, some 
analysts believe Zedillo is not the politician the PRI needs at 
this time; they need someone who is capable of dealing with a 
growing wave of popular discontent as well as with the as yet 
unresolved conflict in the southern State of Chiapas. 
  Colosio's assassination took place on the very day the 
Mexican Senate approved legislative reforms aimed at making the 
election process more honest. The reforms in question resulted 
from a strong political struggle to make the elections as 
impartial as possible, especially in view of the political 
tension experienced in Mexico during past presidential elections. 
  The PRI is in need of a new party spirit, new work methods, 
and less bureaucracy. Colosio once said it should keep the 
people at the core of its decisions, which should not be made 
from behind a desk. If the armed uprising in Chiapas prompted a 
radical change in Mexico, the assassination of the PRI 
presidential candidate creates renewed uncertainty and 
expectations which will not be easy to fulfill.

  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has said 
that he is a candidate for president of the Republic. Minister 
Cardoso today received the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] leaders. Speaking in the name of his party, PSDB 
President Tasso Jereissati invited Cardoso to become a 
presidential candidate. Jereissati said his party considers 
Cardoso's candidacy indispensable. 
  In his speech to the PSDB leaders, Minister Cardoso said he 
accepted the nomination and would carry the banner of victory 
because, according to him, it is the best way in which the 
economic plan can be complied with. 
  Cardoso said that the country is tired of corruption, 
inflation, and poverty. He told his PSDB colleagues that he 
will officially inform President Itamar Franco of his decision 
to step down from his ministry to become candidate for president 
of the Republic during the cabinet meeting that is taking place 
right now at Planalto Palace.

new finance minister. 
  [Begin Cardoso recording] He has already talked to the 
economic team and he is keeping them all in their positions. 
  We have high esteem for Minister Ricupero; we believe he 
will 
help very much in the implementation of the government action 
plan, which was proposed by me but is the government plan and 
belongs to the entire country. The plan will not be changed. 
[end recording] 
  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will grant a news 
conference later today and then leave for Sao Paulo where he 
will spend the Holy Week holidays. 
  The new finance minister will be installed next week.

  [Text] U.S. Under Secretary of Trade Jeffrey Garten on 28 
March will meet President Itamar Franco and several ministers to 
promote the interests of U.S. enterprises, particularly those in 
the areas of telecommunications, intellectual property rights, 
and supplying equipment for the Sivan/Sipam project for 
monitoring the Amazonas -- whose deadline for presentation of 
financial proposals by the international community expires on 5 
April. 
  Garten, who will arrive in Brazil on 27 March, on 28 March 
will meet Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Cesar Flores, who 
runs the Sivan project; President Franco; the ministers of 
industry, commerce, and tourism, and science and technology; and 
Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, Itamaraty's official in charge of 
economic affairs. 
  The objective of Garten's visit -- he also will visit Sao 
Paulo to meet entrepreneurs and then will leave for Argentina 
and Chile -- is to promote U.S. enterprises' interests within 
the framework of the large emerging markets, like those in the 
countries he will visit. 
  Garten's visit will be made after that of U.S. Vice 
President 
Al Gore, who reiterated to Communications Minister Djalma Moraes 
his country's concern over the alleged difficulties that U.S. 
telecommunications and informatics enterprises face when trying 
to enter the Brazilian market. Garten's visit also will be made 
within the framework of a recent exchange of letters between 
Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas and U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who complained about alleged 
restrictions in the Brazilian telecommunications market. 
  Garten recently provoked a diplomatic incident when he made 
negative references to Brazil. 
  The Brazilian Embassy in the United States immediately sent 
a 
letter to Garten expressing "surprise" over his statements, 
because the next day the World Bank announced that "Brazil has 
made significant progress in his commercial reform." 
  Garten recently announced that the United States is 
designing 
a new commercial strategy aimed at 10 specific developing 
countries: Brazil, China, Mexico, Indonesia, India, the Republic 
of Korea, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, and Turkey. 
  According to Garten, the new commercial policy with those 
countries, which are grouped under the label of "big emerging 
markets," [preceding three words in English] was designed in 
proportion to their economies, to their capacity to expand over 
neighboring economies, and to their potential for U.S. exports. 
Garten recently said that within the next few years, most of the 
U.S. commercial expansion will come from the emerging economies, 
even if Europe and Japan remain the U.S.' main commercial 
partners. U.S. exports to those countries amounted to $102 
billion in 1992, one-fourth of U.S. exports.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Brazilians wear, drive, smoke, eat, and 
drink products manufactured by oligopolists; that is, economic 
groups that control their sector of the market. Because there 
are only a few of them, they control prices. The influence of 
these economic groups on the lives of ordinary citizens goes 
from the cement used for refurbishing a house to the cigarette a 
person smokes with a cup of coffee, and encompasses a spectrum 
from razor blades to sugar-cane firewater. Is this just 
fantasy? Not at all. The above assertion is based on facts. 
  The Votorantim and Joao Santos groups, for example, account 
for 70 percent of cement sales -- worth nearly $2.6 billion 
annually -- on the Brazilian market. Souza Cruz and Philip 
Morris control 98 percent of the cigarette sales while Gilette 
controls 81 percent of razor blade sales. Believe it or not, 
three groups -- Pirassunga 51, Velho Barreiro, and Pitu -- 
control at least 51 percent of the sugar-cane firewater market. 
  Luciano Coutinho is an economist from the State University 
of 
Campinas (Unicamp) who was hired by the government to coordinate 
a study on the competitiveness of Brazilian manufacturing 
companies. The study was recently delivered to the government. 
Coutinho says: The Brazilian economy comprises mainly 
oligopolists. A few companies and brand names control the 
market, leaving only a small segment for their competitors. 
  Even in sectors where there are hundreds of manufacturers, 
only a few are able to set prices. For instance, there are 
between 1,200 and 1,500 textile manufacturers, but their prices 
are closely tied to those set by half a dozen large companies 
such as Hering, Pettenati, and Alcatez. Although there are many 
brands of jeans, Vicunha and Alpargatas-Santista control 72 
percent of the supply of denim, so they control garment 
manufacturers too. 
  The same happens in the area of fibers and synthetic yarns. 
Rhodia, Fibra (Vicunha Group), and Celibras control 75 percent. 
To give an idea of how prices are pushed up, one only needs to 
look at a survey conducted by the Industrial Marketing and 
Studies Institute (IEMI). While garment prices increased by 
81.23 percent this year, textile prices increased by 101.64 
percent. 
  When it comes to electronic equipment, Brazilians are 
controlled by oligopolists. Just four manufacturers -- Sharp, 
Philips, Philco, and Semp-Toshiba -- supply 69 percent of all 
television sets at a total annual cost of nearly $1.1 billion. 
Domestic manufacturers do not have much a choice because only 
RTC-Sharp and Philips supply television tubes. Except when 
produced by autonomous manufacturers, all ice cream comes from 
two companies: Kibon, which accounts for 80 percent of the 
sales; while Nestle accounts for the rest. 
  The Philip Morris group owns Kibon, which operates only in 
oligopolistic sectors. In addition to its undisputed leadership 
in ice cream, Philip Morris also controls 70 percent of the sale 
of powdered soft drinks through its brand name Tang, and 20 
percent of cigarette sales through its brand names Marlboro, 
Galaxy, and L&amp;M. Notwithstanding all this, Clodoaldo 
Celentano 
-- financial director of the Philip Morris group -- contends 
that there is "a tough competition" in each of these three 
sectors. 
  Celentano said: Some oligopolists may reach price agreements 
under certain circumstances, but this is not our case. 
Cigarettes, for instance, face tough competition because the 
government is a majority partner in this sector. The government 
is interested in maintaining its tax revenues, which account for 
73 percent of the price of each pack of cigarettes. 
  Few companies are as closely identified with the word 
oligopoly as Gessy Lever. Although its president, Umberto 
Aprile, recently told O GLOBO he did not understand the meaning 
of the word oligopoly, Gessy Lever -- a subsidiary of the 
British-Dutch group Unilever, one of the world's largest groups 
-- plays a significant role in various concentrated sectors of 
the economy. Among others, it accounts for 72 percent of the 
powdered soap market. It also accounts for nearly 30 percent of 
margarine sales. 
  Gessy Lever, which tomorrow will have to justify its price 
increases in URV's [Real Value Units] before the Finance 
Ministry, is not willing to leave any room for its competitors. 
In addition to controlling 75 percent of the powder soap 
market, it has just invested $56 million in a recently opened 
factory in Minas Gerais State, which will increase its annual 
production to 550,000 tons -- well above the annual domestic 
consumption of 420,000 tons. 
  Other companies operate in concentrated sectors of the 
economy, but they are less noticeable and are thus able to keep 
a lower profile. This is the case of companies manufacturing 
fiber-cement roofing sheets and water tanks. Brasilit and 
Eternit control virtually half of this sector, and their 
factories have been consolidated in the past two years. 
Furthermore, the French group Saint Gobain, the owner of 
Brasilit, owns 17 percent of Eternit shares with voting rights. 
Additionally, these two companies own Sama, the only producer 
of fiber-cement in the country. 
  Carlos William de M. Ferreira, assistant to the chairman of 
Brasilit, said: This does not mean that there is a concentration 
of economic power in this sector. 
  A price survey conducted by the Sao Paulo State Association 
of Civil Construction Industries shows that this concentration 
in no way benefits its customers. Of a list of 65 construction 
materials, fiber-cement roofing sheets registered the highest 
increase in URV's in February -- 38.15 percent -- compared to 
the average increase during the last fourth-month period of 1993.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosie Ahuactzin from the "Radio ACIR News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Pedro Aspe Armella, secretary of finance and public 
credit, was one of the first to congratulate the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, like 
he did last 28 November 1993. After greeting Zedillo and 
wishing him success in his campaign for the Presidency, Aspe 
Armella noted that if in fact it is a day of mourning, it must 
also be a day of hope. Aspe Armella asked reporters to let him 
make some statements. He said he had the privilege of working 
with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon in different areas for 
several years, adding that Zedillo is a man with great talent, 
an intelligent, honorable, decent man, and a man who knows 
perfectly well the program of Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  The secretary of finance and public credit had to wait in 
line like other people who were at the PRI headquarters to greet 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. Fernando Solana 
Morales, secretary of public education, was also there. He said 
that after leaving the Secretariat of Public Education, Zedillo 
was fully devoted to Luis Donaldo Colosio's candidacy, adding 
that this is a guarantee he is a unity candidate. 
  Emilio Lozoya Thalmann, secretary of energy, mines, and 
parastate industry, was also there. He, like his fellow party 
members, rallied for unity and solidarity behind Ernesto Zedillo 
Ponce de Leon. 
  Regrettably, the Zedillo's speech to the members of the 
Political Council and the National Executive Committee was not 
heard by the first groups of supporters who arrived at the PRI 
headquarters to express their support for the nominated 
candidate. There were groups of [words indistinct] small 
businessmen of the State of Mexico and the Federal District. 
  Guillermina Rico, leader the former street vendors, was 
among 
the first to greet Zedillo. Zedillo's speech lasted nearly 20 
minutes, but some people did not hear it. Outside, calls of 
Colosio, Colosio, could be heard. People outside then learned 
from media representatives that the announcement had been made 
official. People then asked for Zedillo come out to the plaza so 
they could see his face. Some people said they wanted to see 
and hear the candidate live and not on television. 
  After this official announcement was made, a master of 
ceremonies presided over the salutation ceremony. Curiously, 
this greeting did not take place outside the PRI headquarters 
but inside a room of the PRI offices. Many people, including 
secretaries of state, waited in line to enter the building. 
Genaro Borrego Estrada, director of the Mexican Social Security 
Institute, was also there. 
  Security around the candidate was tight. A metal fence was 
placed outside to avoid overcrowding. During the reception, 
those who wanted to shake hands with candidate Zedillo proceeded 
in an orderly manner. At the end of the reception, which lasted 
approximately two hours until 1500, Zedillo went up to his 
office on the second floor of Building Two of the PRI National 
Headquarters and that was the end of it. Then the people who 
stood outside the PRI office walked away peacefully. The PRI is 
in mourning, but, like Aspe Armella said, it has new hope in 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armente from the "Radio ACIR News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's nomination as the 
presidential candidate for the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] will guarantee unity in that party, and it represents a 
clear continuity of the project promoted by the late Luis 
Donaldo Colosio. State governors agreed with this opinion. 
  The state leaders attended a PRI national dinner to voice 
their full support for the candidacy of Zedillo Ponce de Leon. 
They said he was unanimously nominated and that their goal will 
be victory on 21 August as was the goal under the leadership of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  Jalisco State Governor Carlos Rivera Acedes described the 
decision by the national PRI leadership to nominate Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon as important. 
  [Begin recording] [Rivera] I think it was important for the 
National Executive Committee to make this decision. As our 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo, we too must continue Colosio's 
campaign and carry on with Colosio's platform. I am sure all 
PRI members will unite around our party and our candidate 
Zedillo, and will work intensely to ensure that Colosio's 
platform is carried on. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there merit to [words indistinct] 
6 May speech to separate the PRI from the government? 
  [Rivera] Yes, I think that this is definitely one of the 
principles that should be reinforced. 
  [Reporter] Is Zedillo the most capable? 
  [Rivera] At this time, he is not only the most capable but a 
person who was close to Colosio. He knew well the principles 
that candidate Colosio was promoting. [end recording] 
  Guerrero State Governor Ruben Figueroa said Zedillo is a 
guarantee for victory. He added that Zedillo is as strong and 
vigorous a horse as Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta was. 
Meanwhile, Maximiliano Silerio Esparza [not further identified] 
assured that the figure of Luis Donaldo Colosio will help the 
new campaign for the Presidency. Esparza added that he knew 
Colosio well, worked very closely with him, and that he has all 
the respect in the world for the person who was once his party's 
presidential candidate. He said there will be a very profound 
campaign and added that he is sure that Colosio will continue 
helping PRI in this new phase of the presidential campaign. 
  Meanwhile, Puebla State Governor Manuel Bartlett Diaz said a 
consultation process took place before Zedillo was nominated. He 
pointed out that Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon was nominated by 
generalized consensus. Veracruz State Governor Patricio Chirinos 
reaffirmed what Bartlett said. He pointed out that Zedillo is a 
unity candidate. Quintana Roo Governor Mario Villanueva, Morelos 
Governor Antonio Riva Palacios, Campeche Governor (Jorge Salomon 
Asad), Tamaulipas Governor Manuel Cabazos, Oaxaca Governor 
(Diegoro Carrasco), Sonora Governor [name indistinct], and 
Tlaxcala Governor Antonio Alvarez Lima, among others, made 
similar statements. The governors were pleased. They agreed that 
Zedillo's nomination is a logical decision for the campaign 
strategy. 
  Mario Moya Palencia, former government secretary and current 
coordinator of the PRI Ideology Commission, pointed out that 
within the PRI there are no groups disputing power. Proof of 
this, he added, is that the PRI was able to nominate a 
replacement, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, six days after the 
death of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Moya Palencia described Zedillo 
as a politician with technical abilities; a man of humble 
origins who will win the trust of Mexico and the international 
community. He said that the presidential candidacy of Zedillo 
will face some risks but they can be overcome. 
  [Begin Moya recording] Presidential candidates run risks. A 
crazy person could now say let us avenge Colosio by killing 
another candidate. That is the danger of a violent atmosphere. 
I think that all of us, especially those involved with the 
media, must contribute to preventing the emergence of an 
atmosphere of distrust, violence, and support for armed 
solutions. [end recording] 
  Mario Moya Palencia also admitted that there will no longer 
be easy campaigns in Mexico. He pointed out, however, that the 
historical, sentimental, political, and leadership legacy of 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, will join Zedillo's campaign. 
  Meanwhile, the PRI labor and peasant sectors pointed out 
that 
they have adapted to their party's decision and have voiced with 
discipline their full support for the presidential candidacy of 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. CTM [Confederation of Mexican 
Workers] President Fidel Velasquez and National Peasant 
Confederation leader Hugo Andres Araujo agreed that the 
candidate who replaces Colosio guarantees PRI unity and that PRI 
will triumph on 21 August. 
  Araujo added that Zedillo is a courageous and energetic PRI 
member who has a great willingness to continue the ideological 
project of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Velasquez agreed with Araujo. 
He said that for the organized labor movement Zedillo represents 
continuity of Colosio's ideas. The CTM leader added that, like 
Colosio, Zedillo will be the candidate of the country's working 
class. 
  These were some of the reactions given at the PRI National 
Headquarters after the PRI national leadership nominated Ernesto 
Zedillo as their presidential candidate.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas and former presidential hopeful -- 
even before the nomination of Luis Donaldo Colosio -- has sent a 
letter to Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the new PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. 
Camacho Solis sent this letter on his personal letterhead. The 
letter reads as follows: 
  The 1993, 1994, and current political options are similar. 
We need to have stability and peace for Mexico to have 
progress, justice, financial stability, and democracy. The 
options for achieving this stability will determine our 
political future. First of all, we might fall prey to the 
illusion that the fastest way to guarantee order is through the 
display of hatred, exclusion, intolerance, and rejection of 
disparate views. On the contrary, we could, from a profound and 
serene recognition of the source of the problems, the 
aspirations of society, and an appropriate perception of the 
nature of the conflicts, reach the conclusion that such a 
climate of stability and peace will only arise from respecting 
individual and human rights, and that in order to produce it we 
need to garner the initiatives of nongovernment and civic 
organizations, respect freedom of expression, and accept 
disparate views. 
  Stability requires the strict implementation of the law, not 
only to control society but also to impose limits on state 
actions. This is required in any democratic and free nation. 
There is increasingly less and less time and room to attempt to 
find a balance by separately taking parts of one political trend 
or another. Faced with the facts, we must wield our options. 
  Manuel Camacho Solis tells Zedillo Ponce de Leon: Your 
responsibility is a very serious one. I urge you to use all 
your intelligence, honesty, and patriotism to place yourself 
above any interests and to focus your initiatives on the path of 
peace, justice, and democracy. It is necessary to consolidate 
the PRI candidacy to prevent the national situation from 
worsening. You have and will have my support as long as a 
republican and democratic government plan is being implemented. 
The democratic option requires national unity; unity that 
involves all the political forces and citizens that strive to 
build a more just Mexico. 
  Signed: Manuel Camacho Solis

  [Text] Mexico City, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party's [PRI] National Political 
Council designated Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon as its new 
candidate for president. Zedillo Ponce de Leon was born in 
Mexico City on 27 December 1951. He is the son of Rodolfo 
Zedillo Castillo and Martha Alicia Ponce de Leon. He is the 
second of six brothers, after Luis. Following him came 
Guadalupe, Lorena, Veronica, and Rodolfo. He is married to 
Nilda Patricia Velasco Nunez and is the father of five children: 
Ernesto, Emiliano, Carlos, Nilda Patricia, and Rodrigo. 
  Zedillo holds a B.S. degree from the National Politechnical 
Institute's Higher School of Economy, where he studied from 
1969-72. He also studied economics at the University of 
Colorado in 1974. He received a master's degree and a doctoral 
degree in economics from Yale University, which he attended from 
1974-78. His doctoral thesis was entitled: "External Public 
Indebtedness in Mexico: Recent History and Future Oil Bounded 
Optical Growth." [thesis title as received in English] 
  He worked as an economic researcher in the Secretariat of 
the 
Presidency's National Directorate for Economic and Social 
Programming from 1971-74, as an economist with the Bank of 
Mexico from 1978-82, and as deputy manager for economic and 
financial research in the same bank in 1982. He was secretary 
for programming and budget from 1988-92. In 1992, he was named 
secretary for public education, a post from which he resigned on 
29 November 1993 in order to join the campaign of the now 
deceased PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
  He was a professor at the Colegio de Mexico from 1981-83. He 
distinguished himself with his economic studies, which in turn 
led to his appointment as secretary for programming and budget. 
He outlined the National Development Plan, which has led to 
important political, economic, and social changes during the 
government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. With the 
motto "Planning Is Prevention," Zedillo outlined the government 
strategies established since 1988 to date and within whose 
framework the government drafted programs to lower inflation by 
reducing spending, resuming growth, and attaining steady 
progress in the economic recovery. 
  As the person responsible for the proposals dealing with 
1989, 1990, and 1991 disbursements, he appeared before the 
Chamber of Deputies and corresponding commissions on several 
occasions, where he mounted an imprtant defense of the budgets 
and the National Solidarity Program. Zedillo also participated 
in laying the groundwork for the national agreements on the 
country's modernization, which led to an increase in several 
special allocations for agriculture and education. 
  While he was secretary for programming and budget, Zedillo 
pursued dialogue, negotiation, and harmony with all governors, 
including those in opposition. Later, when he was secretary for 
public education, he subscribed to the thesis that "the higher 
the education, the greater the wealth," which held that the 
country's modernization was not just "fashionable" but an 
essential requirement in raising the country to the level of 
advanced countries with an eye on the 21st Century. In this 
context, he negotiated and secured approval for changes to 
Article 3 of the Constitution. He had the Congress approve a 
new General Education Law as an essential measure in meeting the 
challenge of the country's education with the new millenium in 
mind. Progress made in education during Zedillo's tenure 
crystallized in a national plan for the modernization of basic 
education, reform providing for free textbooks, and the reform 
of teachers' career tracks.

  [Text] Mexico City, Federal District, 29 Mar (EFE) -- 
Today, the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) 
said the new ruling party presidential candidate, Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon, will give priority to economic issues and 
will relegate social issues. PRD spokesman Julio Ulloa said the 
campaign of the late Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, was characterized by its 
inclination to address social problems such as poverty. "This 
new candidate totally changes the focus of the electoral 
campaign. Colosio had focused on social issues as has the PRD 
government program," he pointed out. The spokesman added that 
because of the post he held in the government, Zedillo's 
campaign will apparently focus on economic issues and their 
social repercussions. 
  Since November 1993, Zedillo had been a coordinator for PRI 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio's campaign, who was assassinated 
on 23 March in Tijuana on the U.S. border. Colosio had realized 
that addressing poverty was a priority of the times, but this 
will most probably be placed in the middle level of importance 
by the new candidate although he will continue the programs of 
the current government. Ulloa added that the new candidate will 
make the differences between the campaigns of the PRI and PRD, 
the country's third electoral force, more evident.

  [Text] Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution] has stated that in view of the country's 
circumstances, it is important for the government to be cautious 
because if it hardens its policy it will be risking the nation's 
social stability. Commenting on the nomination of Ernesto 
Zedillo Ponce de Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party] presidential candidate, the national PRD leader said that 
now more than ever, the political dialogue must be increased to 
guarantee clean elections. 
  [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We hope that there will be no 
hardening of positions. The country's conditions make it 
advisable for the government to be cautious, wise, and tolerant. 
The Chiapas problem is not solved. There is concern and even 
emotional instability in vast areas of the country. We must 
advise the government to be cautious, increase political 
dialogue, and not allow the nomination of a candidate to be put 
on the same level with the appointment of a president. That 
would be the worst mistake that the system could make at this 
point. [end recording] 
  Munoz Ledo added that it is probable that Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas 
will resume his campaign after Holy Week.

  [Text] Mexico City, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Today, the Attorney 
General's Office (PRG) accused former policeman Tranquilino 
Sanchez Venegas of complicity in the murder of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio, PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential 
candidate. The murder occurred on 23 March in Tijuana. 
  Sanchez Venegas was arrested on Saturday. He then gave his 
deposition to the Attorney General's Office. Today, in federal 
court, he was accused of alleged complicity. The suspicion that 
he participated in the murder is based on an analysis of the 
videotape broadcast on television and on graphic material in the 
police's possession where it appears that Sanchez Venegas, while 
watching, opened a path through the crowd for the murderer, 
without acting to prevent it, as confessed murderer Mario Aburto 
Martinez shoots Colosio in the right temple. 
  Various PRG officials, who asked to remain anonymous, 
indicated that the arrest of the former policeman was made after 
a lady friend of Aburto Martinez declared that on 11 March the 
two individuals met in a Tijuana park. According to official 
reports, the former policeman was employed by the Tijuana PRI 
for "crowd control" at the event were Colosio was murdered. 
  Colosio was murdered on 23 March in Tijuana as he was 
concluding an event in his electoral campaign. The candidate was 
shot in the stomach and in the head. This resulted in instant 
brain death. Three hours later he died. The alleged murderer is 
being held at the Almoloya jail in Juarez, Mexico's maxiumum 
security jail. He is expected to be tried in the coming weeks 
once the investigation concludes. The PRG has indicated that for 
now, no one else has been arrested as an accomplice in the 
murder, although several individuals are being investigated.

<F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>
  [Text] The Senate of the Republic -- bunting on the podium, 
silver eagle laid on the presidium -- yesterday observed 
solemnly a minute of silence in memory of Luis Donaldo Colosio, 
senator on sabbatical and murdered PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate. 
  And it approved by 50 votes from the largest political 
forces 
of the country -- including PAN [National Action Party] Senator 
Hector Teran Teran, who did not attend the session in order to 
be part of the honor guard of politicians at Colosio's funeral 
-- reforms to Article 41 of the Constitution of the United 
Mexican States. Upon expanding the autonomy of the electoral 
mechanisms of the country, this reform makes electoral 
mechanisms citizen-oriented. 
  The reforms to Paragraphs 8, 9, 17, and 18 of the 
aforementioned article were approved with the participation of 
49 [number as published] senators -- all dressed completely 
black except Nuevo Leon Senator Maria Elena Chiapas, who wore a 
black and white silk dress. Henceforth, Article 41 shall read 
as follows: 
  "The organization of federal elections is a state function 
that is carried out by an autonomous public agency, furnished 
with legal status and its own resources. It is formed by the 
Executive and Legislative Branches of the union, with the 
participation of national political parties and citizens, as 
established by the law. In exercising such state functions, 
certitude, legality, independence, impartiality, and objectivity 
will be guiding principles." 
  Additionally, "the public agency will handle electoral 
matters, will be professional in its performance, and will make 
its decisions independently; its structure will consist of 
direction, executive, technical, and surveillance mechanisms. 
The higher direction body will be made up of counselors and 
citizen counselors appointed by the Legislative and Executive 
Branches, as well as representatives appointed by the political 
parties. The executive and technical mechanisms will have 
qualified personnel necessary to provide professional electoral 
service. The surveillance mechanisms will consist mostly of 
representatives of the national political parties. The direction 
board of polling stations will be formed by citizens." 
<H5>  Independent Judges and Magistrates </H5>
  The reforms consider that "the Federal Electoral Tribunal 
will organize itself under the terms established by law. For 
carrying out its duties, it will have bodies of magistrates and 
judges, who will be independent and will only respond to the 
mandate of the law. The magistrates of the tribunal must satisfy 
the requirements established by law, which will be no less than 
those established by this Constitution to be a justice of the 
Supreme Court. They will be elected by two-thirds vote of the 
members of the Chamber of Deputies present, after being 
nominated by the president of the Republic. 
  "The citizens counselors of the higher direction organ must 
satisfy the requirements established by law and will be elected 
by receiving two-thirds of the vote of the members of the 
Chamber of Deputies present. The counselors will be elected 
from the lists of nominees proposed by legislative groups in the 
very Chamber. The law will establish the corresponding 
regulation and procedure." 
  The reforms, which presidential candidate Cuahutemoc 
Cardenas 
Solorzano termed insufficient, brought about differences between 
him and Porfirio Munoz Ledo, president of the PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution], it was learned last 18 March at a 
crowded PRD rally in the Central Plaza. 
  Commenting on those differences, Munoz Ledo said yesterday 
"some feel the direct representation of the public powers should 
be entirely out of the electoral organism." 
  He added "that is where the country is likely to head, but 
for now the parties agreed to let the Executive Branch official 
in charge of the country's internal affairs remain the chairman 
of that organism although "now without casting the tie-breaking 
votes, and proposal to formalize a tradition that has been in 
practice until now, namely, to use his right to vote in the 
deliberations of this corps." 
  "Majority and minority representatives from the two 
congressional chambers, where the parties can state their views 
through their representatives," also remain. "I must emphasize 
this because a very important step has been taken, meaning the 
political parties will no longer have the right to vote, only to 
state their views, in the organization. Thus, they will no 
longer be judge and jury in their own favor." 
  Munoz Ledo added: "In our opinion, we abide by the principle 
we adopted by consensus. Unfortunately, this could not be done 
in the 1989 legislative period. According to the principle, no 
formal or informal party or government-party coalition will have 
a predetermined majority in the electoral organization." 
  He said: "Six highly respected and honorable citizens will 
be 
confirmed by two-thirds majority in the Chamber of Deputies. 
These citizens will be elected by consensus among the parties 
and they will be a result of the two chambers' actual 
configuration." 
  Munoz Ledo said he is "certain the reform, which firmly 
points toward the citizens' participation in electoral 
organizations, will allow the operation of subordinate agencies; 
abolish bureaucracy and unfair attitudes; and, if its 
implementation is correct, help increase the citizens' 
confidence in the elections." 
  Carlos Jimenez Macias, directorate board chairman for this 
period of sessions, said that -- with these reforms -- "our 
legislation acquires a modern dimension which places it among 
the most advanced in the world, and among the ones which offer a 
higher degree of certainty." 
  He said: "Within this important debate, legislators 
protected ideological pluralism -- which is characteristic of a 
democracy -- and the lofty dignity which corresponds to their 
investiture." 
  The ceremony ended once the reform was approved, thus ending 
the second special period of congress sessions.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgina Howard] </F>
  [Text] The Financial Opening Committee, which has already 
received requests by four U.S. banks and three Canadian ones to 
open branches in Mexico, said it will closely verify that 
regulations for the establishment of affiliates in the country 
be kept. It also guaranteed they will not give preferential 
treatment to anyone as they will maintain the same treatment 
given to national affiliates. 
  The committee members, which include specialists from the 
Finance Secretariat, Bunco de Mexico, and the national banking, 
securities, insurance, and financial commissions, announced that 
stock market and foreign stock specialists must present a 
program of their participation in intermediary activities and 
must specify the market segments they will attend. 
  Investment and investment management companies, the 
committee 
stated, must explain their participation in the companies they 
are promoting, the sale of shareholders' stock, and the services 
they will render. 
  Insurance and financial companies must report to authorities 
the market sectors they will attend, the specific fields they 
will cover, and the description of the coverage they will offer. 
<H5>  Exact Information </H5>
  In the specific case of stock market affiliates, the 
Financial Opening Committee explained that the intermediaries 
will have to specify their activities in stock, money, 
intermediary, collateral, and financial corporation markets to 
ensure that their activities are carried out in a diversified 
and competitive manner. 
  Furthermore, the stock market affiliates must prepare an 
investment management company program to determine how many 
[branches] will be established; in what field; the amount of 
initial capital paid; market position; risk diversification 
strategy; basis for the implementation of utilities, 
organization, and control; computer systems; and a five-year 
program for the opening of offices. 
  In addition to the above, the program must also provide a 
yearly individual financial forecast based on macroeconomic 
estimates, which must include expected GNP, inflation, interest 
rates, exchange rates, expected company entry into stock market 
and financial system, as well as payment of foreign exchange, 
employment level, infrastructure investment, and expense 
increases. 
  Based on those projections, the commission asserted, the 
stock market companies must make a yearly growth forecast as 
well as ones on market participation; growth in [stock] custody, 
account custody, and employee custody; solvency; liquidity; 
leverage; global capital, utility margin; and net utilities at 
present values. 
  The stock specialists must stipulate the type of values they 
will promote and the services they will offer, specifying the 
amounts and quoted operational margins such as risk 
diversification strategies. They must include macroeconomic and 
company estimates in their projections. 
  As for investment companies, the Financial Opening Committee 
added, they must detail their objectives; stock purchasing and 
selection policies; bases to diversify assets and plans to sell 
stock issued; participation in the companies promoted and sale 
of stockholders' stock policies; name of its controlling 
company; and segments of the market it will attend. 
<H5>  Marketing Is Coming </H5>
  Companies that manage investment companies must present -- 
in 
addition to the aforementioned requirements -- its program to 
promote and distribute stock issued by the investment companies 
they manage to the public; types of investment companies they 
will service; amount of working capital in case they want to 
establish a private company of variable capital; macroeconomic 
and company estimates. 
  For insurance company affiliates, the requirements include 
the operations or fields in which they want to operate; type of 
insurance to be offered in Mexico; financial budget, which 
includes technical and capital reserves; segment of the market 
and geographic position of the area they want to cover; 
description of the coverage they will offer; retention and 
reinsurance policies, as well as policies to attend accidents, 
adjustments, and general claims. 
  The financial companies, concluded the committee, must add 
the description of the finances to be offered, including a 
report on premiums, rates, examples of contracts or clauses; 
policies on deductions, cofinancing, and refinancing, as well as 
their policy on attention to claims and macroeconomic and 
company estimates.

<F P=106> [Report by Leticia Rodriguez Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Ricardo Dajer Nahum, president of the Confederation 
of National Chambers of Commerce, Concanaco, has said that 
Mexico's economic project "has not drifted off course" and that 
continuity of the country's economic policies is essential for 
the population's tranquility. 
  Control of the country has not been lost. The course remains 
the same. The "tragic" event in which presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio lost his life, which intended "to divide us 
and make us confront one another," does not mean that Mexico "is 
going overboard." For this reason, "we must remain calm and 
have Mexico's future clearly before our eyes," he said. 
  The leader of the country's organized commerce said that, 
although violence has increased in Mexico and there is even a 
state of "psychosis" in some states because of kidnappings, the 
possibility of establishing the death penalty in the country is 
a delicate matter that requires a careful analysis and that 
"very nearly requires a national forum." 
  In a news conference, Dajer Nahum said that more federal 
highway police are needed, more training of the Judicial Branch 
is required for this branch to act efficiently, and the 
penalties passed should be "stiff enough" to discourage illegal 
actions. 
  He also said that certain crimes, such as the kidnappings 
that have caused "psychosis" in Sinaloa, Sonora, and Coahuila, 
must be given special attention so they can be avoided and 
resolved. Although, "technically" speaking, these types of 
crimes could discourage investors, the crimes must be resolved, 
not only for economic reasons but for the security to which all 
Mexicans are entitled. 
  Dajer Nahum also said that the store owners' response to a 
call for declaring a partial stoppage and then resuming their 
activities at noon on 28 March has been favorable throughout the 
country. He said this is a country-wide protest against the 
recent violent events and at the same time reaffirms their 
support for the Mexican Government. He added that the financial 
cost of this stoppage will be minimal because stores will remain 
closed only a few hours. 
  He went on to say that the social price is nonexistent 
because the basic services employees have been asked to work 
normally so the country's economic life is not disturbed at all. 
He also said that the partial closure of stores throughout the 
country will serve to repudiate violence and Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's murder and to demand that the state of law, democracy, 
harmony, and justice prevail. 
  Finally, he said he is sure the investigation of Colosio's 
murder will yield results soon and that a clear report will be 
issued so the community "can learn what the situation is."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  In January, the combined effects of more imports and a new 
decline in petroleum revenues generated a 26.9 percent increase 
in the trade deficit over the January 1993 figure, according to 
preliminary reports from the Bank of Mexico. In January, the 
Mexican foreign deficit trade balance -- without including 
figures from assembly plants -- was $1.831 billion, that is, 
29.9 percent higher than January 1993. The Bank of Mexico also 
indicated that imports for January totalled $5.551 billion, that 
is, 20.3 percent higher than same period in 1993. (Mexico City 
LA JORNADA 21 March 94 p 39) 
  The Mexican Employers Confederation has said Mexico is 
currently experiencing its "highest unemployment in history and 
that no immediate solution to this problem seems near." 
Meanwhile, the Private Sector's Center for Economic Studies has 
assured that the drop in employment was practically across the 
board in all activities in 1993, when over 200,000 jobs were 
lost. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 22 March 94 pp 1, 10) 
  Mexican Petroleum (PEMEX) has begun renegotiating credit 
with 
banks in Japan, Europe, and the United States for a total of 
$1.1 billion that will be used to help pay a debt contracted in 
1979. This debt totalled $1.5 billion at the end of 1993. For 
PEMEX, the payment of this debt is of great importance as it 
equals 90 percent of the financial obligations contracted before 
the so-called "debt crisis." (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in 
Spanish 22 March 94 p 8) 
  The Bank of Mexico's international monetary reserves 
increased to $27 billion in January, that is, $4 billion more 
than in December 1993. The Banorte Financial Group indicated 
that the current turbulence in financial markets is locally 
generated by political and not economic factors and from abroad, 
due to the hike in interest rates in the United States and the 
trade conflict in Japan. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 
22 March 94 p 5) 
  On 9 March, outstanding government securities held by 
foreign 
investors totalled 80.3 billion new pesos, a 11.5 billion 
increase over the end of 1993. These figures, according to the 
Bank of Mexico, indicate that foreign participation in the 
purchase of government securities continues to rise, adding that 
the turbulence in the exchange and stock markets is short term. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 7) 
  Mexico and Costa Rica have agreed to eliminate export 
subsidies for agricultural products as of 1999. At that time, 
both countries will renounce both the rights established under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that grant the 
use of export subsidies and any rights that could result from 
multilateral negotiations within GATT. But as of 1 January 
1999, neither of the two nations will be allowed to continue or 
introduce subsidies for the export of its reciprocal trade. 
(Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 23 March 94 p 20) 
  PEMEX's 1993 taxes rose to 55.409 billion new pesos, a 
figure 
that includes both direct and indirect taxes. This represents 
3.7 billion pesos more than in 1992 "under the adoption of a tax 
regime that acknowledges the new organizational structure of 
this institution and its subsidiaries." At the end of 1993, 
PEMEX paid the Treasury a total of 32.945 billion new pesos for 
hydrocarbon extraction rights and in other direct taxes. 
(Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 23 March 94 p 49) 
  Today, the National Bank of Mexico (Banamex) signed a new 
line of credit for $75 million with the Export Development 
Corporation to finance capital goods, equipment, and services 
imported from Canada. Banamex explained that this credit will 
support the reconversion and modernization of the industrial 
sector and the struggle against environmental contamination. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0307 GMT 25 March 94) 
  This year Procampo (Program for Direct Support to the 
Countryside) has earmarked 244 million new pesos for Chiapas 
that will benefit 90,000 families, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, 
secretary of agriculture and hydraulic resources (SARH) has 
reported. During a working tour, the secretary handed out 
44,220 new pesos to 107 producers of basic crops who are 
registered in development district number 02 in San Cristobal de 
las Casas. The SARH secretary indicated that the executive has 
issued instructions that special support be extended to Chiapas 
producers. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 24 March 94 p 9) 
  This year, PEMEX's Exploration and Production Division, with 
an investment of 7 billion new pesos, will undertake a number of 
strategic projects for the incorporation of reserves, 
development of petroleum potential, and the development of new 
production fields. The goal is to maintain existing production 
of hydrocarbons and to add to the nation's proven reserves, 
given that in the past decade these reserves have declined. 
(Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 24 March 94 p 10) 
  Thanks to strict budget discipline, increased internal sales 
and savings in some sectors, and lower operating and investment 
costs, PEMEX generated a primary surplus of 4.149 billion pesos 
in 1993. That figure is 3.2 percent higher than the 1992 amount. 
PEMEX financed its investments with revenues generated 
internally as part of the framework of the payment of direct and 
indirect taxes. This allowed PEMEX to preserve its solid 
financial structure and maintain a satisfactory operational cash 
flow. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 28 March 94 p 31) 
  The National Foreign Trade Bank reports that the opening of 
trade has favored the United States in the last five years to 
the tune of $15 billion with regard to Mexico. Currently over 
80 percent of Mexican exports go to that country, while 71 
percent of imported merchandise is from the United States. 
Changes in foreign trade patterns promoted by this government 
appear to have increased dependency on one market: the United 
States. Only 3 percent of Mexico's exports go to Canada, while 
1.6 percent of Mexico's imports come from that nation. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 28 March 94 p 21) 
  According to the British ambassador to Mexico, the UK plans 
in the short term to increase its investments in Mexico -- 
currently at $2.6 billion -- in the petrochemical, automobile, 
and tourism industries, despite the period "of confusion and 
destabilization that the country is now enduring." The 
ambassador said the murder of Institutional Revolutionary Party 
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio will in no way discourage foreign 
investors or cause capital flight. Meanwhile, the Panamanian 
ambassador said that the current unstable situation will in no 
way affect the signing of new trade agreements. (Mexico City LA 
JORNADA in Spanish 28 March 94 p 2)

<F P=106> [Article by Marcela Angulo from the "Good Morning" column] </F>
  [Text] President-elect Jose Maria Figueres has set his 
foreign trade priorities and consolidated his determination to 
renegotiate the Third Economic Adjustment Program (PAE III) with 
the World Bank. 
  Figueres plans to strengthen relations with the other 
nations 
on the isthmus and to continuously intensify regional trade -- 
with a potential market of 30 million -- with a view to having 
this bloc join NAFTA at some future date. 
  Judging from his statements to the press, Figueres plans to 
effect structural reforms through agreements and credits similar 
to those the current administration made with other cooperation 
organizations in financial and educational matters. 
  Nonetheless, and in spite of the interest that Figueres has 
indicated in attracting foreign investment and technology in 
order to increase the competitiveness of Costa Rican 
enterprises, the macroeconomic and commercial policies his 
administration will promote are still a little vague. 
  As Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas explained recently, 
in order for Costa Rica to prepare for its probable 
incorporation into NAFTA -- this will take from eight to 10 
years -- the national strategy should necessarily include 
opening up the services industry. 
  The main reason for this would be that the United States is 
hoping to improve its position in global trade regarding the 
sale of services and intellectual property. These 
characteristics are already apparent in the bilateral treaty 
signed with Mexico and Canada. 
  The Calderon Administration's PAE III includes reforms that 
are headed in that direction. A change in these would represent 
a setback or impasse for the country; the cost might turn out to 
be too high in the long term. 
  It is not enough to establish a goal -- to become part of 
NAFTA -- one must also adopt changes required to reach it. In 
my opinion, this point is not clear to our economy's future 
strategists.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
29 March. 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales has reported that 
Costa 
Rica's net international reserves totalled $964 million in 
January 1994, while in December 1993 these reserves reached $945 
million. Corrales added that in January the Central Bank 
obtained important amounts of foreign currency through the sale 
of $50 million in bonds issued by the Costa Rican Electricity 
Institute. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 12 March 94 p 11A) 
  Deputy Finance Minister Jose Rafael Brenes has reported that 
Costa Rica's internal public debt increased from 182 billion 
colones in 1992 to 242.7 billion colones in 1993. Brenes 
explained that the debt rose because the government had to make 
heavy payments to clear up its debts with state banks and with 
the Social Security Fund, as well as heavy payments on its 
foreign debt. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 13 March 94 p 
12A) 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas has reported that the 
Mexican companies resident in Costa Rica generate 8 percent of 
the gross domestic product of this Central American country, 
equivalent to approximately $523 million per year. This figure 
will probably grow to nearly 10 percent, some $50 million, once 
the bilateral free trade enters into effect in January 1995. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0905 GMT 16 March 94) 
  The Exports and Investments Promotion Center (Cenpro) has 
reported that Costa Rican exports of edible roots have increased 
at an annual rate of 26 percent from 1990 to 1993. Cenpro 
reported these exports amounted to $30 million in 1993. (San 
Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 13A)

<F P=106> [By Cristina Hasbun de Merino] </F>
  [Text] San Salvador, 25 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The major 
parties, namely, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (right-wing 
Arena), and the leftist coalition, which includes the former 
guerrillas, already know who will support them in the possible 
runoff presidential elections in April. Both parties claim that 
they will win. 
  The decision of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the 
third Salvadoran political force, not to support either 
contender cleared up the new electoral panorama and dispelled 
rumors about a possible alliance with ARENA, of which the PDC 
has been among the staunchest critics. 
  Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the former Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front [FMLN] guerrillas, told ACAN-EFE that 
the PDC decision "creates conditions to increase the coalition's 
possibilities to win over votes." 
  Arena Deputy Rene Figueroa, however, told ACAN-EFE that the 
PDC decision "does not affect us" because his party "is 
supported by a majority of the Salvadorans." 
  The PDC leadership based its decision on the fact that the 
government models of the contenders in the runoff elections -- 
which has not yet been officially announced by the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] -- "fail to meet the aspirations of our 
voters," and this leaves us free to choose "conscientiously." 
  The runoff election will pit ARENA's Armando Calderon Sol, 
the former San Salvador mayor, and Ruben Zamora, vice president 
of the Legislative Assembly. The latter was nominated by the 
former FMLN guerrillas, Democratic Convergence (CD), and 
National Revolutionary Movement (MNR). 
  Rene Figueroa said that, although his party will not ask the 
left wing to give up a runoff election, its leaders "should 
reflect and save us energy and money, because it is clear that 
most Salvadorans want democracy and liberty, this meaning ARENA." 
  Zamora, his partner Francisco Lima, and the leaders of the 
three parties that comprise the coalition yesterday rejected 
rumors that it would not participate in runoff elections and 
demanded that the TSE guarantee the vote of all Salvadorans. 
  The ARENA deputy doubted that the PDC rank and file would 
vote for the left wing, because that party has faced several 
divisions in recent times and "discontented PDC members who 
already voted for the FMLN on 20 March." 
  A visibly happy Villalobos, however, said that the PDC 
decision "improves everything because the PDC rank and file is 
an important element in the runoff election that will be 
decisive, and it will vote for us." Juan Ramon Medrano, also of 
the FMLN, told ACAN-EFE that the minority parties, namely, the 
Unity Movement and National Solidarity Movement, of evangelical 
persuasion, have adopted an attitude that is similar to that of 
the PDC. He pointed out that what is important is "that they 
did not side with ARENA." 
  The only party that decided to support ARENA is the 
conservative National Conciliation Party (PCN). Its secretary 
general and presidential candidate Roberto Escobar Garcia told 
ACAN-EFE that Arena's alliance is "mainly based on our 
ideological line, and obviously, we do not support the FMLN." 
  Calderon Sol and Zamora said they are talking with various 
sectors in search of support for the runoff elections. They are 
also willing to reach a consensus, because they realize that 
governing will be the major problem of the new peace situation. 
  The candidates agree that the TSE must solve serious 
anomalies that were present during last Sunday's elections, in 
which 84 deputies to the Legislative Assembly and 262 mayors 
were elected. The most serious problems were related to the 
voter registration list. Many citizens were unable to vote 
because their names were not on it. There were delays in 
opening voting sites, lack of transportation, and other 
incidents the United Nations described as "minor."

<F P=106> [Report by Julio Amilcar Nuila] </F>
  [Text] There is still tense calm here. Many people are 
outside the local office of the justice of the peace. Hours of 
heavy tension were experienced here. Everything began in the 
morning hours, about mid-morning, when people here accused a 
U.S. citizen of being presumably linked to gangs that are 
stealing babies. 
  There was no special or legal basis on which to make such an 
accusation; however, the rumor was disseminated and the 
population united and tried to lynch the woman on the street. 
Local authorities intervened and managed to give her refuge at 
the local court building. A large number of people surrounded 
the building. We must note that they all used children and 
teenagers as shields to prevent the public forces from using 
greater coercive measures to calm down the people. 
  The situation worsened by the moment. Everyone was demanding 
that U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), 51, come out. She is 
an editor for a U.S. magazine who hails from Florida and is 
residing in Alaska. The woman said she entered the country 
through Huehuetenango, toured El Quiche, arrived in San 
Cristobal Verapaz, and was about to board a bus to head for 
Coban -- she said she had come to see the beautiful carpets of 
the solemn processions that are made here -- but she did not 
imagine what was awaiting her. 
  The situation, I repeat, turned red-hot. I was, from the 
very beginning, the first local reporter covering the situation 
from the courthouse here at San Cristobal Verapaz. We all tried 
to mediate. The volunteer firefighters showed up. They were 
attacked as they pushed their way through the mob. The 
departmental Red Cross also showed up, and its members were 
attacked. The assistant human rights official also tried to 
intervene. The crowd listened to no one. 
  They said they wanted blood and that they would not be 
pleased until they saw blood. After trying to mediate, the 
police -- in an attempt to calm down the population that started 
to smash glass windows and make the situation more violent -- 
threw a can of tear gas, and this, instead of achieving the calm 
that was desired, actually infuriated the mob even more. 
  The situation turned much more difficult. All of us who were 
inside the courthouse gathered in an extremely small room. We 
took refuge there while the rest of the building was being 
destroyed by the mob. We observed a fire. The fire was already 
surrounding the room housing the reporters, Red Cross members, 
firefighters, policemen, the assistant human rights official, 
the local justice of the peace, and the U.S. citizen who was 
being protected in the nearby restroom. 
  The mob, however, nearly lynched every person inside the 
building. We managed to leave, and the U.S. citizen fell into 
the hands of the furious mob. The first report indicated that 
she was completely massacred. However, when the volunteer 
firefighters managed to reenter the building, they realized she 
was badly injured but still alive and breathing weakly. She was 
naked and her skull was partially destroyed. This was a very 
dramatic situation. She was bathed in blood. 
  The 187th Unit of Volunteer Firefighters took her 
immediately 
to the regional hospital. We are quite far away from Coban. At 
this time we do not know whether the U.S. citizen is alive. Her 
prognosis has not yet been disclosed. 
  The presence of the National Army has been requested since 
noon. Regrettably, members of the Army 21st Military Zone showed 
up after all this had transpired. San Cristobal Verapaz is 
currently under military control. 
  We want to give you a last-minute report: Another citizen 
who is identified only as Luis Miguel -- he is called Mike here 
in San Cristobal and resides here -- was called by authorities 
of the local justice of the peace to serve as an interpreter and 
was apparently seriously beaten up. He is being taken to the 
regional [name indistinct] hospital. 
  The local justice of the peace reported that the residence 
of 
a U.S. family residing here in San Cristobal has been closely 
monitored by the population. Rumor has it that they are also 
involved in the stealing of children. The sin then is to be a 
U.S. citizen. They have been branded. The Army is currently 
headed for that residence to persuade them to evacuate this 
place, which is a dangerous place for foreigners.

<F P=106> [Report by Willy Melgar; from the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] repeated reports on an attack 
perpetrated in the country's interior during the past days, the 
[words indistinct] announcement in Puebla, Mexico on agreements 
reached by the government and the guerrillas within the 
framework of the dialogue started in 1991. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio might attend the signing of the 
human rights agreement reached by the Guatemalan Government and 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], according to 
sources in Mexico's Foreign Relations Secretariat. 
  The parties reached preagreement points in the overall human 
rights accord. Among them are promises to: 

  -  Guarantee and protect the basic rules [preceptos]; 
  -  Fight impunity, and for this purpose, promote the necessary 
modifications of the Penal Code; 
  -  Strengthen democratic institutions; 
  -  Attain immediate international verification; 
  -  Institute voluntary military recruitment; 
  -  Fight against any evidence of illegal corps in the country; 
and 
  -  Compensate the victims of human rights violations. 

    It was reported that the URNG invited Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada, conciliator for life of the process, Teresa de [word 
indistinct], and other personalities of Guatemalan civilian 
society to attend this ceremony. It was also reported that in 
this round of talks there was consensus on the establishment of 
a timetable for the agreements reached in Mexico on 26 April 
1991. 
  The Mutual Support Group [GAM] today issued a statement on 
the establishment of a Truth Commission in reaction to the news 
of the agreements reached in Puebla, Mexico, during the last 
round of talks between the government and the guerrillas. The 
GAM document states: Guatemalans are experiencing times of hope 
by knowing that the government, Army, and URNG decided to hold 
talks and find political solutions to the internal armed 
conflict that was produced by the profound inequalities that 
exist in the country. It is evident that we have talked about 
two Guatemalans historically: one of Spanish-Indian descent 
[ladina] and the other Indian. We must definitely learn to 
integrate into a single nation with a [word indistinct] sense, 
while respecting diversity, but working in the same direction 
and with the same objective -- to turn Guatemala into a homeland 
for all. 
  The document adds: [Words indistinct] to the extent that we 
seriously correct the mistakes of the past, which we all 
committed by action or omission. (?This is no time) to analyze 
who is to blame for the systematic and repeated problems that 
led to their accumulation. The truth is that there was a wall 
of silence and this nourished all those who had thoughts that 
went against the state of things. What has been established is 
not necessarily the rule to follow; there are options. 
  It further states: History (?zealously) teaches us, who 
remember it, that those who acted with impunity in the years of 
the repression will continue to do so. They (?built) a strong 
structure, which will be difficult to dismantle, and today are 
deciding the fate of the country at all levels through different 
methods but with the same results. 
  Thus, the document adds, it is imperative and indispensable 
to create conditions for the Truth or Investigative Commission. 
This, however, must not be a pantomime to get out of trouble. 
A document specifying that there will finally be a cease-fire 
should be signed. The Truth or Investigative Commission should 
be precisely that: a commission to deal with the truth 
regardless of the influence that a civilian, soldier, or 
insurgent, who killed defenseless and unarmed citizens with 
impunity, might have. We are therefore not referring to those 
from one party or the other who have fallen in the crossfire. 
  It states: We clearly specify that we are talking about the 
Guatemalans who were kidnapped, murdered, or massacred by 
uniformed paramilitary groups while at home or walking on the 
streets.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio today expressed satisfaction 
over the general [global] human rights agreement his government 
reached with the guerrillas at a meeting in Puebla, Mexico. 
  "I believe all Guatemalans should be pleased with the 
progress made in the negotiations process," the head of state 
said on Radio "Sonora." 
  De Leon explained that he cannot express any opinions 
concerning the agreement because he pledged not to do so during 
the talks. Only the UN moderator, Frenchman Jean Arnault, can 
provide details. 
  Nevertheless, he emphasized that "considerable progress has 
been made" with the signing of the general agreement on human 
rights which excludes the Truth Commission, which was formed to 
investigate violations of individual guarantees throughout the 
34 years of the armed conflict. 
  The president said that he and the Armed Forces High 
Command, 
which he also heads, have been in permanent contact with the 
National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace (COPAZ) 
presided over by Hector Rosada, examining each of the points as 
they were agreed upon. 
  "We have been fully informed, and we ought to be pleased 
because considerable progress has been made," de Leon stressed.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- The agreement 
on human rights reached in Mexico by the Guatemalan Government 
and the guerrillas is the greatest outcome in three years of 
negotiations and opens the possibility for President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio to meet his objective of pacifying the nation. 
  The former human rights ombudsman -- who became Guatemala's 
president on 6 June 1993 in the midst of a terrible political 
crisis originated by ousted President Jorge Serrano's failed 
self-coup -- has paved the way to peace with the signing of an 
overall agreement on human rights with the rebels. 
  The Government Peace Commission (Copaz) and the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity's (URNG) "military command" reached 
this agreement in Puebla (Mexico) after overcoming several 
obstacles throughout three years of conversations. 
  The agreement with the rebels strengthens Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio's administration, which during his 10 months in power has 
lost credibility and the support of the diverse sectors of 
society that demand an end to the conflict and better living 
conditions. People's leaders consulted by ACAN-EFE indicated 
that light can now be seen at the end of the tunnel and that 
even though the agreement has been signed true hope lies in its 
fulfillment and the beginning of the end of the massacre. 
  "The signing of the agreement is a victory for the whole 
community that pressured the government and the guerrillas. It 
is not a voluntary gift, although it fell on Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio," stressed Rosario Pu, leader of the Committee of Peasant 
Unity (CUC). 
  Meanwhile, Rosalina Tuyuc, leader of the National Commission 
of Guatemalan Widows (Conavigua), told ACAN-EFE that a first 
step has been taken for a constitution of civilian communities 
[pueblos civiles] and that this agreement will stimulate and 
support the people. "For us the signing of this accord is very 
important because it opens up a space for society," she 
highlighted. 
  Meanwhile, Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia 
Laguardia said the agreement gives "a new glimmer of hope to the 
population" because the parties have demonstrated their 
democratic calling to reach an understanding. Garcia recognized 
that the work of Frenchman Jean Arnault was a key to reaching 
the accord, with which the incipient democracy will be 
strengthened in the medium- and long-term. For the human rights 
ombudsman now "it is necessary to form a national front of peace 
to discuss an agreement of social conditions as the only way to 
end the instability." 
  Nineth Montenegro, president of the Mutual Support Group 
(GAM), also told ACAN-EFE that after 34 years of war the 
agreement represents "a significant step forward" in the 
attainment of peace. "I am very happy to hear there is talk of 
democratizing and demilitarizing the country," the human rights 
leader remarked. 
  The issue of human rights was the most complex one of the 11 
points on the agenda agreed upon in Mexico in 1991 by the 
government and the URNG under the mediation of Catholic Bishop 
Rodolfo Quezada Toruno. According to Quezada Toruno, who was 
dismissed from the negotiations by de Leon Carpio, who in turned 
requested the UN mediation, under his mediation the parties were 
nearing the signing of an accord, but the foiled coup 
perpetrated by Serrano on 25 May 1993 ruined all the efforts. 
  The peace negotiations became bogged down several times 
during the coupist government of Serrano, and although de Leon 
gave new momentum to the process, it was not until last January 
that his representatives were able to meet for the first time 
with rebel leaders in Mexico. 
  De Leon removed the main players of the government in the 
process and appointed Hector Rosada to head the government 
delegation. Rosada has been charged with exerting pressure to 
force Quezada Toruno's removal and dissolve the National 
Reconciliation Commission. 
  The signing of the human rights accord and its international 
verification mark the end of a 34-year-old armed confrontation 
in Guatemala, the only country in Central America where tension 
remains. The undeclared civil war has left more than 150,000 
people dead, some 250,000 widows, and 45,000 missing persons due 
to political reasons, as well as thousands of refugees.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  Six days after trading at the foreign exchange market began, 
the price of the U.S. dollar price has stabilized. On Monday, 
the exchange rate stabilized at an average of 5.81 quetzales to 
the dollar. The supply of U.S. dollars is exceeding the demand. 
Ana Lucrecia Montes Granai, head of Granai Bank's foreign 
exchange department, has reported that the new flexibility in 
the exchange policy has made it possible for the productive 
sector to buy as many dollars as it wants. (Guatemala City 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 23 March 94 p 88) 
  Antonieta de Bonilla, vice president of the Bank of 
Guatemala, has reported that the system's liquidity increased 
more than 200 million quetzales after the action last week by 
the Bank stopped the public sale of foreign exchange and 
established a flexible bank market. She said that as a result 
of the authorities' decision to decentralize the purchase and 
sale of foreign exchange, the bank no longer needs to put 
Guatemalan currency into circulation. Measures to lower 
interest rates and make the exchange policy more flexible are 
part of the Monetary Board's strategy to keep inflation at 8 
percent and the economic growth rate at 4.5 percent this year. 
Prices and exchange rates have stabilized, she reported.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Ramon Huerta] </F>
  [Text] Wiwili, Jinotega Department -- All the inquiries 
into the death of FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] 
Political Secretary Javier Barahona in this town lead to the 
conclusion that it was a political crime. "It was particularly 
aimed at him because of his quality as a natural leader and not 
just because he is a Sandinist," residents and authorities 
concurred. 
  The climate in this town has turned violent. "Things have 
regressed. Mistrust prevails again, and the hopes of any needy 
persons in the programs Javier was implementing have been 
dashed," Rosa Benavidez, a town resident, said with a broken 
voice. 
  Sergeant Major Faustino Herrera Palacios, the officer in 
charge of the local police, told BARRICADA the case will be 
transferred today at the latest to the judge who will try the 
armed chieftains in absentia. A visibly shaken Herrera Palacios 
went to the place where Barahona had been bound. He found him 
without eyes and tongue, and with a knife embedded in this chest. 
  According to preliminary investigations, Barahona was 
viciously killed. "It was a horrendous murder, preceded by a 
kidnapping. The culprits are Omar [not further identified], 
Jose Davila Reyes, Estrella [not further identified], and Erasmo 
Vasquez Salgado," the authorities affirmed. 
  The police said armed men intercepted a bus with passengers 
between Jinotega and Wiwili, and went straight for Javier 
Barahona. His brother, Cesar Barahona, got off the bus, but was 
told to get back on it. These men took Javier Barahona to Aguas 
Amarillas and killed him near Bola de Cuajada Mountain. "They 
removed his boots, pants, personal effects, and left him there," 
Herrera Palacios stated. 
  "At approximately 1800, I heard four shots and told my son: 
`That sounds bad. They killed Barahona,'" Leonila Castro, a 
resident of the area where the Sandinist leader was found, 
stated. 
  In addition, Herrera Palacios said the armed men carried a 
list of persons with Sandinist affiliation, including persons 
from Wiwili, adding they know their victims well. This opinion 
coincides with that of the area residents who said the armed 
person were tailing Barahona since the previous Sunday. 
  This kind of operation shows these men are the remnants of 
El 
Guapote's group because Omar -- a young man who just a few years 
ago was a child seen on Wiwili's streets -- joined this rebel 
leader and afterward was a member of the 3-80 Northern Front. 
When El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera] began negotiations with 
the government, he and Chele Gringo [not further identified] 
were opposed and left to become active in the area around the 
town. 
  Army troops have been pursuing this group -- estimated at 
between 15 to 20 men -- since noon Wednesday. They have 
disbanded, thus hampering their capture. Until yesterday, there 
had been no contact with them, but "we hope to soon," the 
military source said.

  [Text] Cobija, 15 Mar (ANF) -- According to a "sincere and 
painful confession" made by Colonel Mario Flores Alanez, the new 
Pando Police Department commander who has become the terror of 
drug traffickers and criminals in less than one month, the 
passivity of officials has allowed drug traffickers to 
infiltrate the Pando Police Department. 
  Commenting on recent counternarcotics operations in Trinidad 
-- joint forces operations that took everyone here by surprise 
-- Col. Flores said: "As I have reported to my superiors, I 
must confess that our command did not offer any guarantees. 
Drug traffickers were informed about our actions. I have 
expressly requested the transfer and even discharge of some 
officers charged with specific felonies." 
  According to the police chief, the infiltration of drug 
traffickers has caused the failure of at least two operations in 
recent weeks. In view of this situation, he was compelled to 
make changes in the Police Intelligence Department. Only then 
was he able to arrest eight drug distributors. Nevertheless, 
and despite the adoption of strict measures, at the last minute 
he almost lost his prisoners when some relatives and groups 
hired by drug traffickers promoted a riot to try to free those 
under arrest. 
  Police are looking into this riot against the police, which 
was intended to look like a spontaneous action. Col. Flores 
said that at first even the local civic committee was involved, 
"but fortunately everything has been cleared up." 
  Based mainly on the testimony of those arrested, it has been 
established that in Pando there is an organization operating in 
different circles with the direct or indirect support of groups 
in power that are acting knowingly or unknowingly. 
  The investigation started with the arrest of drug users who 
identified the places where the merchandise was sold and drug 
distributors. After their arrest, the latter in turn supplied 
information on the drug distribution networks and the obtaining 
of supplies from the country's interior. As a result, one of 
the leaders of this group was arrested in Trinidad. He has been 
identified as Desiderio Rodriguez, who two weeks ago transported 
a cocaine shipment from Santa Cruz to Cochabamba. 
  Rodriguez reportedly supplied valuable information on drug 
suppliers and drug trafficking financiers, among whom are 
well-known people in the region. It has been learned that a 
common fund was established to purchase drugs and "huge" profits 
were distributed among the investors who pretend to ignore how 
their money is illegally used." [quotation marks as published] 
  The investigations in Pando will continue in greater depth 
because it has been confirmed that a Special Antinarcotics Force 
unit has been installed in Trinidad.

  [Excerpts] The Special Antinarcotics Fight [FELCN] command 
destroyed on 19 March one of the largest cocaine processing 
laboratories that have been found in the last few years. In an 
operation called "Canaveral" which took place at 1330 on 18 
March, the FELCN found the laboratory located 5 km in a straight 
line west from Viru Viru Airport, near the Sanchez valley. The 
FELCN could not, however, arrest any of those who had been 
processing the drugs until a few minutes before the operation. 
The laboratory had the capacity of processing some 300 kg of 
cocaine per week with a degree of purity that is not common in 
our country. 
  The FELCN had been informed that a cocaine shipment had left 
the laboratory to be sent to Brazil. The FELCN agents 
nevertheless found more than 500 kg of cocaine in various 
processing stages at the site. According to experts, the drugs 
were being processed in accordance with severe norms aimed at 
obtaining an ideal substance for export. The laboratory was 
inside a nearly 20 hectare farm planted mostly with sugarcane. 
The La Belgica sugar mill is 15 km from this laboratory. 
  FELCN District Commander Colonel Hector Frias Cardozo did 
not 
reveal the names of those arrested because of this operation, 
but it has been unofficially reported that at least four 
suspects have been identified. A second stage of this operation 
is still being conducted at the capital of Santa Cruz 
Department, to identify the owner of the farm and those who are 
involved in the illegal activity. Apparently the laboratory has 
been operating at the site for at least one year. [passage 
omitted] 
  Together with the drugs, the FELCN agents burned 90 liters 
of 
ammonia, 13 kg potassium permanganate, two kg caustic soda, 200 
kg calcium chloride, 175 liters of sulphuric ether, 50 liters of 
sulphuric acid, seven kg manitol, and 400 liters of acetone.

  [Text] Chile and seven other countries have made a 
presentation within GATT against the United States. The 
presentation contained claims against U.S. measures affecting 
the sales of tobacco on the U.S. market. 
  This information was released by the Foreign Ministry 
through 
an official communique stating that the Chilean Government and 
the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Thailand, and Zimbabwe have made a joint presentation. 
  The presentation was made before the GATT panel, which has 
canceled the kinds of measures adopted by the United States, 
which affect the import, sale, and use of tobacco on the U.S. 
market. 
  The measure adopted by the United States, the Chilean 
Foreign 
Ministry states, is based on the U.S. budget law, which imposes 
several restrictions on imported tobacco, among them that 
cigarettes should contain at least 75 percent of tobacco 
produced in the United States. Failure to comply with this 
regulation will prompt the imposition of heavy fines, the U.S. 
law sets forth. The U.S. law was approved on 10 August 1993. 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry states that such regulations 
violate GATT agreements, particularly Article No. 3, which 
forbids the enforcement by countries of local regulations, that 
is, regulations compelling the total or partial use of local raw 
materials for any product. 
  Considering that this regulation affects the importation of 
Chilean tobacco, the Foreign Ministry adds, the Chilean 
Government supported the presentation to the respective panel, 
awaiting a favorable decision, which should be made within the 
next few months.

  [Text] A commission of Chilean experts will travel to 
Belgium this week to participate in negotiations for the 
possible purchase of Mirage bar's (Mirsip) [Mirage Safety 
Improvement Program]. This information was released by Under 
Secretary of Aviation Mario Fernandez after attending an 
academic briefing on the subject held at the Political Science 
Institute of the University of Chile. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] As far as I know, a commission 
will be traveling within the next few days. It is part of the 
decisionmaking process. I responsibly said here -- just as 
ex-Defense Minister Patricio Rojas put it before leaving his 
post -- that substantial progress has been made toward making a 
decision on the Belgian Mirages. This does not mean a final 
decision has already been made. Several steps are still to be 
taken, and they are the steps that the Air Force and the Defense 
Ministry are responsibly taking. [end recording] 
  Mario Fernandez added that the purchase of these planes was 
announced at the end of the previous administration by then 
Defense Minister Patricio Rojas, and that this was a gesture of 
political responsibility. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording, in progress] ...because the 
entire process of the examination of various alternatives for 
replacement of the Hunters, which the Chilean Air Force has 
implemented, to some extent reached a conclusion during the 
previous administration. 
  Upon conclusion of the process, it is obvious that the 
government had to make a decision to support this technical 
decision. Before leaving his post, ex-Minister Rojas made the 
decision and announced it. In this regard I believe that the 
proper conclusion of all the proposals or initiatives of an 
administration is a gesture of political responsibility. [end 
recording] 
  If the deal is finally made, the Belgian planes will replace 
the obsolete Hawker Hunters which the Air Force has used since 
the end of the 1960's. Experts have noted the importance of the 
possible purchase of the Mirages, which will give our Air Force 
top offensive power in this part of the world.

  [Text] General Ramon Vega, commander in chief of the 
Chilean Air Force [FACh], has reaffirmed that the FACh is facing 
space challenges and called upon politicians to clearly define 
defense policies that will take these new objectives into 
account. 
  Vega made these remarks during a speech he delivered on 21 
March at El Bosque Air Base to mark the FACh's 64th anniversary. 
  The ceremony was presided over by President Eduardo Frei 
Ruiz-Tagle and attended by Interior Minister German Correa, 
Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma, acting Senate President 
Ricardo Nunez, Army Commander Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, 
Carabineros Director Rodolfo Stange, and Vice Admiral Jorge 
Patricio Arancibia, chief of the National Defense Staff. 
  Also attending the ceremony were four defense ministers from 
friendly countries who had been invited by the FACh to attend 
Fidae '94 [International Aerospace Fair]. They are: Oscar 
Camilion (Argentina), Army General Victor Malca Villanueva 
(Peru), Daniel Hugo Martinez (Uruguay), and Hugo Estigarribia 
(Paraguay). 
  Those defense ministers met on 21 March with their Chilean 
counterpart at the Diego Portales building. 
  Commanding officers from the air forces of Argentina, 
Germany, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, 
China, France, Russia, and Venezuela also were present at El 
Bosque Air Base. They are all attending Fidae '94 too. 
  In his 25-minute speech, Gen. Vega stated that the sphere of 
action and influence of a modern air force must be in keeping 
with national security commitments coherent with the country's 
development and with space challenges facing the institution. 
"From a multipurpose perspective, from the standpoint of FACh 
capabilities regarding space sciences, it is obvious that FACh 
tasks go far beyond the principles and limits of this concept." 
  The FACh chief said that to solve this problem it is 
incumbent upon the highest political level to outline specific 
objectives, scope, doctrines, and purposes. 
  Vega added that ties between the government leadership and 
the FACh leadership must be strengthened to become "a symbiosis 
between politicians and experts" that would be instrumental in 
defining permanent guidelines aiming at higher objectives, "all 
of which must be fully integrated into the nation's overall 
aerospace system." 
  In his speech, Gen. Vega reaffirmed that the FACh is 
committed to meeting the challenges posed by space, "a vital 
resource for a nation that is seeking to go hand in hand with 
modernity." 
  Vega noted that the FACh has worked for two years in this 
endeavor and already has implemented a project to build an 
experimental microsatellite to evaluate four basic experiments: 
the evaluation of the ozone layer, the transfer of 
meteorological data, communications, and search and rescue 
operations. 
  Vega added that the Fasat-Alfa project is an essential first 
step toward acquiring the basic scientific experience required 
to move on to more difficult, complex stages. 
  After the speech, there was a ground parade and an air show. 
For the first time in Chilean history, Peruvian and Argentine 
military aircraft participated in this show.

<F P=106> [Article by Hernan Garcia] </F>
  [Text] The Chilean Air Force (FACH) will put the first 
national satellite into orbit in 1995 from a still undefined 
launch platform. The satellite will be carried by a rocket of 
the "Ariane" project design from the British company "Surrey 
Satellite Technology" of Surrey University. 
  The satellite is called "Fasat-1" and is being developed by 
a 
group of Chilean and British aeronautic engineers. It weighs 50 
kg and has four 80-centimeter sides. Initially, it will be 
placed in a low polar orbit 800 km from earth. It has a useful 
life span of six years. 
  The satellite may be launched from platforms in French 
Guyana, Baykonur in Russia, or PRC platforms in Jiuquan or 
Jichank. 
  According to the agreement signed with the British company 
-- 
which already has launched five similar satellites and 
manufactured two other ones for the ROK and one for Portugal -- 
two models will be manufactured. One will be put into orbit and 
the other will be a prototype to check on the flight design, 
develop the software, and then correct possible mistakes. 
  This microsatellite, as it is defined in accordance with its 
international rank, will carry four experiments: communication 
with remote meteorological sites, aeronautic link with planes 
flying distant routes such as the Santiago-Easter Island route, 
permanent monitoring of emergency signals from planes and ships 
involved in accidents, and experiments with the detection of 
atmospheric ozone. 
  The government plans to decisively incorporate space 
technology into the national community and create a national 
consciousness about the importance of this area as a logical 
prospect for future FACH action. 
  This is why the government plans to stimulate educational 
and 
research organizations to analyze new ways of entering this 
advanced field. Currently, 15 FACH officers who are taking 
postgraduate courses in space sciences are working in this 
program. Three of them are taking a master's course on the 
subject. 
  As a result of the agreement with the British company, the 
program has the two following stages. Immediately after the 
first satellite, "Fasat-2" will be launched. It is a 
constellation comprised of three microsatellites to be put into 
different orbits and will be manufactured in Chile. Finally, the 
"Geosat" will be launched in no more than 15 years. 
  The "Geosat" will ensure a national telecommunications 
service based on two satellites placed in a geostationary orbit 
36,000 km above the earth. 
  To make this initiative available nationwide later on, the 
beginning of the FACH experimental conquest of space will be 
explained at the Technology Pavilion of Fidae '94 [International 
Aerospace Fair), which begins 20 March.

  [Text] The Chilean Army is studying ways to replace its 
oldest armored vehicles, particularly the overhauled Sherman 
tanks that have been in service since the late 1950's. 
  This replacement will probably be made easier following the 
end of the Cold War in Europe and the disarmament treaties 
signed in that continent, which means a large number of very 
good quality tanks are being sold at very low prices or even 
being given away. 
  Like other National Defense branches, the Army is undergoing 
a modernization process that includes the replacement of its old 
armored vehicles, which currently do not surpass 300. Most of 
them are Sherman and M-41 tanks that were in use at the end of 
Second World War. 
  Through agreements with other countries, our country has the 
necessary technology to co-manufacture artillery systems, 
trucks, short-range weapons, and rocket systems like the 
"Lightning." 
  Asked about possible plans to replace Army hardware, General 
Augusto Pinochet, the Army commander in chief, replied that the 
Army neither comments on nor publicizes its acquisitions. 
  "We do not display our things ... we would rather be 
discreet," he noted. 
  It was leaked that a European nation may soon supply Chile 
with a fleet of medium-sized French AMX-30 or German Leopard-1 
tanks in a number comparable to the Sherman tanks that are now 
in service. 
  Meanwhile, the Army has decided that, until a deal is 
finalized, it will refurbish its oldest hardware. 
  Brigadier General Luis Iracabal, the Famae [Army Ordnance] 
director general, has said there have been preliminary talks 
about replacing the tanks but there has not been "a real 
institutional need" to close any deals. 
  He pointed out that "Famae has refurbished several tanks and 
jeeps, fitting them with anti-tank cannons with the help of the 
Army's War Material service." 
  Gen. Iracabal said the only alternative for an Armed Forces 
without large resources at their disposal is to maintain their 
equipment in good condition. 
  "We are now working at full speed on the manufacture of an 
armored personnel carrier -- the Mowak 8 x 8 -- since this 
project is behind schedule," he noted. 
  Asked about the presence of Famae at the FIDAE 
[International 
Aerospace Fair] '94, Gen. Iracabal said Chilean Army's most 
important military manufacturer is exhibiting a new 
anti-aircraft system, which was entirely designed in Chile. 
  The "Lynx" was developed in partnership with Linxtronic [not 
further identified] and consists of a defense radar mounted on a 
truck, which can be fitted with up to 16 different systems of 
anti-aircraft weapons, such as missiles and rapid-firing 
cannons, even of Russian origin. 
  He explained that the system, which is totally computerized, 
can track anything at a distance of 40 km and aim the 
interconnected weapons at the target.

<F P=106> [Article: "War Secrets"] </F>
  [Text] SEMANA reveals unknown details about the 
increasingly obvious two-month-long confrontation between the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the government. 
  At 0830 Saturday morning, Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales, a 
member of the Cauca Valley drug trafficking organization, 
appeared at the Palmira jail to turn himself in. The surrender 
came at a precise time when relations between the government and 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff had reached their most 
critical point. This was not only true because of the flexible, 
accommodating position which the government thinks De Greiff has 
taken on the surrender of the Cali cartel kingpins, but also 
because of explosive revelations made the preceding week at a 
Special Security Council meeting on the criminal activities of 
members of the Medellin Cartel being held at La Picota and La 
Modelo prisons in the capital whom the prosecutor general wanted 
to move to Itagui once again. 
  The situation has reached such a point that the prosecutor 
general has in recent days given serious consideration to the 
possibility of accusing Minister of Justice Andres Gonzalez of 
malfeasance before the Supreme Court. The government promptly 
considered the possibility of accusing De Greiff of 
"collaborating with drug trafficking," SEMANA was told by one 
well-placed source at Casa de Narino. Things were made even 
worse, observers say, by the legal and personal controversy 
involving the prosecutor general and top-ranking government 
officials which is doing serious damage to the image and 
credibility of the institution he represents. 
<H5>  Problem With Cali </H5>
  The wrangling between the prosecutor general and the 
government began even as talks began for the surrender of the 
Cali Cartel organization. De Greiff cast the first stone in the 
United States when speaking at a seminar in Baltimore. He stated 
that the war on drug trafficking had been lost and that 
consequently, the drug business should be legalized. By that 
time, the prosecutor general's talks with the attorneys for the 
Cali Cartel were already off the ground. 
  De Greiff also stated his intention of allowing house arrest 
for members of the cartel, to which the minister of justice 
immediately responded that house arrest was not part of the 
surrender policy. However, the straw that broke the camel's back 
was the meeting which De Greiff held with three recognized drug 
traffickers in the Valley: Helmer Herrera, better known as 
"Pacho Herrera," Jose Olmedo Ocampo, and Juan Carlos Ramirez, 
whom he certified based on Article 369E of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. 
  The confrontation became so obvious that no one is even 
trying to conceal it any longer. When rumors circulated in the 
past concerning such differences, the prosecutor general, 
ministers, attorney general, and president himself hastily 
denied them. When SEMANA divulged these differences for the 
first time a month and a half ago, the prosecutor general sent 
an indignant letter to this periodical and Gaviria told the 
daily newspaper EL TIEMPO that "there are no differences with De 
Greiff." This time, however, not only did the same personages 
not deny the dispute, but they made no effort whatsoever to hide 
it. 
<H5>  Itagui Problem </H5>
  The final break between the prosecutor general and the 
government started at a special Security Council meeting on 
Monday, the 7th, when, based on intelligence reports from DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security], DIJIN [Judicial and 
Investigative Police Directorate], and the National Penitentiary 
Institute (INPEC), an order from De Greiff to transfer Carlos 
Mario Alzate Urquijo, alias "Arete," Luis Carlos Aguilar 
Gallego, alias "El Mugre," Gustavo Adolfo Gutierrez Arrubla, 
alias "Maxwell," Jose Fernando Posada Fierro, and Jorge Pizano 
Santamaria from Bogota to Itagui was rescinded. The Council 
deemed that the transfer of the prisoners to Itagui was highly 
improper in terms of the policy of the surrender to justice 
inasmuch as allowing it meant opening the doors for the 
reunification of the so-called Medellin Cartel. 
  Once the government had decided not to allow the return of 
the five prisoners to Medellin, the prosecutor general went 
after the Security Council. "The inmates have neither the 
intention nor the means to revert to criminal activities," De 
Greiff said, adding that "I do not believe in those intelligence 
reports." The intelligence reports do in fact exist, however, 
saying precisely the opposite of what the prosecutor general 
thinks. 
  During a night inspection in November, INPEC and Police 
officials discovered a jacuzzi in the maximum security block of 
La Picota prison where "Arete" and "El Mugre" were caught at 
2300 by the officials performing the inspection and whom they 
tried to bribe. INPEC ordered another inspection a week later 
and found the prisoners partying. Bottles of liquor and 
marijuana papers were found in their cells. DIJIN and DAS had 
also detected a series of calls between La Picota inmates and 
their contacts in Medellin ordering them to continue their drug 
trafficking. 
  It was also learned that some 40 wardens had been forced to 
resign from INPEC because of threats against their lives. Every 
time they left the maximum security blocks in Bogota or 
Medellin, they encountered signs bearing their names saying "You 
are dead meat!" 
  As if this were not enough, La Modelo prison security 
intercepted a letter apparently addressed to "the Pepes" or the 
Cali Cartel people stating the following: "I want you to know 
that a guy is kidnapping people and dealing from here. He is 
doing it along with the guerrilla Francisco Galan and his 
fiancee. The guerrilla asked all of us to go with a bunch of 
people to kidnap her. The only one that called a halt to it was 
Otto and on 20 January, they kidnapped one Tomas Uribe. Jessica 
was the one who informed Galan in jail." 
<H5>  Permits </H5>
  At the two-hour-long Security Council meeting on Monday, not 
only were the intelligence reports analyzed, but a detailed 
study was made of authorizations issued to private parties by 
the prosecutor general to visit prisoners in the security blocks 
of La Picota and La Modelo prisons in Bogota. 
  The Security Council was struck by the many permits issued 
to 
Pablo Escobar's family to visit John Jairo Velasquez Vasquez, 
alias "Popeye," at La Modelo prison. Escobar's wife visited 
Popeye five days later. On that same day, she also received 
authorization to see "Arete" at La Picota. Two days later, the 
prosecutor general signed an authorization allowing Juan Pablo 
Escobar to enter La Modelo to meet with Popeye, and Escobar's 
son visited Arete that same day. On 3 February, the prosecutor 
general once again issued an authorization allowing Maria 
Victoria de Escobar to enter the maximum security block at La 
Picota prison to meet with Arete. 
  Another authorization that troubled the Security Council 
members was the one which the prosecutor general issued to 
Dagoberto Arturo Recio Chavez. On 14 January, the latter 
appeared at the La Picota administrative office with a permit 
from the prosecutor general allowing him to visit inmates Jose 
Fernando Posada Fierro and Jorge Pizano Santamaria in the 
maximum security section. A subsequent investigation by security 
organizations established that Recio Chavez is an investigator 
for the Prosecutor General's Office who gained admittance to La 
Picota in order to write a report on conditions in the block. It 
was also discovered that the official from the Prosecutor 
General's Office had been arrested on 14 February 1985 and 
charged with forgery. He became inmate number 205593 at Model 
Prison. 
  Among the countless permits issued by the prosecutor general 
is one granted to a former beauty queen for regular visits to 
Roberto Escobar when he was a patient at the Military Hospital 
after the letter bomb incident. 
  Finally, the Security Council took up the matter of 
prosecutor Cruz Helena Aguilar's meeting with Carlos Mario 
Alzate Urquijo, Luis Carlos Aguilar, Gustavo Adolfo Gutierrez, 
and Jose Fernando Posada. It became evident that it was no mere 
legal proceeding, but a meeting between a representative of the 
Cali Cartel named Luis Guillermo Angel Restrepo and the Medellin 
people aimed at clearing up the death of Antioquia Governor 
Antonio Roldan Betancur. 
<H5>  What the Future Holds </H5>
  There are those who thought that Julio Fabio Urdinola's 
presentation on Saturday would be followed by a truce in the war 
between the government and the Prosecutor General's Office. 
However, early statements by the prosecutor general and the 
president made it quite clear that such would not be the case. 
De Greiff hastened to say he hoped that what had happened would 
end "the government's hysteria," while Gaviria said Urdinola's 
surrender was a very good thing to consolidate the policy of 
surrender, but that it would in no way fix things with the 
prosecutor general. 
  Whatever the case, the country can learn several lessons 
from 
what has happened. The first of these is that these things occur 
when legislation is drafted that gives rise to ambiguity, as was 
the case last year with the Code of Criminal Procedure, a matter 
on which both the Prosecutor General's Office and the government 
were in agreement. Ambiguous legislation gives rise to 
interpretations as contradictory as those now made by both the 
Executive Branch and the prosecutor general on standards to be 
applied in the case of the surrender of the Cali Cartel. 
  The second great lesson is that in a country that has 
suffered from drug trafficking for so many years, cooperation 
between government and legal authorities is not only desirable, 
but absolutely necessary, however much the prosecutor general 
may claim that the agency under his tutelage is autonomous and 
that Colombia has a separation of powers. Article 113 of the 
1991 Constitution states that "the different organs of 
government have separate functions, but will cooperate 
harmoniously to achieve their goals." If this must be so in any 
one field, it is in the fight against drug trafficking, where 
victories have been obtained only when the different organs of 
government have worked shoulder to shoulder. That is why, in 
addition to being indispensable, cooperation between the 
government and the Prosecutor General's Office is vital. Two 
entities detached from the government: the Police and DAS, must 
do the work of security and intelligence and the Prosecutor 
General's Office must use that information and make it 
judicially useful. 
  Through INPEC, which falls under the Ministry of Justice, 
the 
government must guarantee that those arrested and convicted must 
go to prison. Other agencies of government are involved in the 
process, however: the Armed Forces as a whole in the seizure of 
shipments; the FAC [Colombian Air Force] and Aerocivil with 
respect to planes used in trafficking; and the Superintendency 
of Banking and Exchange with respect to drug trafficking money 
laundering. 
  For all of these reasons, entrenchment such as that of 
Gustavo de Greiff with respect to the autonomy of the Prosecutor 
General's Office can be valid from the legal standpoint, but 
mistaken in practice. Something similar can be said about 
cooperation with the government of the United States. However 
much it may displease many nationalistic Colombians, Washington 
is Colombia's main partner in the fight against drugs and to 
break with that country can be as costly as doing so in the 
commercial or political fields. 
  Whatever the case, as confirmed by statements made following 
Urdinola's surrender, the confrontation has apparently reached 
the point of no return. It is too early to say which of the two 
camps is ahead in the public opinion polls. The Prosecutor 
General's Office has lost much of the prestige it enjoyed 
several months ago, as shown by recent polls. Even so, however, 
De Greiff continues to enjoy great credibility. If he does not 
want to lose it, he will have to demonstrate that the business 
he proposes with the people of Cali is not only good for that 
city, but right for society. The Prosecutor General's office 
will have to compile proof and reconstruct solid cases against 
those newly surrendering. If it does not do so, not only will 
the prosecutor general and his office lose respectability, but 
the greatest judicial reform of contemporary Colombia, 
establishment of the accusatory system, will be on the verge of 
collapse.

  [Text] The unannounced deployment of tanks and soldiers 
from the regiments in Cerrito (Chaco) on 28 March caused unrest 
among Cerrito residents. The troops conducted exercises on 28 
March for about two hours near the regimental base. 
  In this regard, Colonel Carlos Medina Monjagata, the Armed 
Forces social communications director, reported that the tanks 
from the "Colonel Felipe Toledo" No. 2 Armored Cavalry Regiment 
were mobilized within the framework of a training exercise 
program for new recruits. 
  He explained that citizens were not informed about the 
mobilization because it was scheduled to be held in the vicinity 
of the regiment. He added: "The people are not informed when a 
two-hour exercise is held. They are informed only when tanks 
will cross the Paraguay River so that no one is alarmed." 
  Medina Monjagata stated that normally the recruits 
participate in two training exercises, the first during the 
basic training period and the second during the advanced program.

  [Text] Montevideo, 29 Mar (EFE) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina will begin a diplomatic offensive "seeking to 
reinsert Cuba into Latin America." The tour will start in 
Montevideo on 4 April. New Cuban Ambassador to Uruguay Manuel 
Aguilera de la Paz made this announcement during an interview 
with EFE. 
  Robaina will be in Montevideo from the morning of 4 April to 
the afternoon of 6 April and will meet with the country's main 
political leaders. Robaina will visit Quito [Ecuador], Lima 
[Peru], Asuncion [Paraguay], and Buenos Aires [Argentina]. Its 
"priority is to explain our policies in favor of Latin American 
integration, which includes economic as well as political 
integration," Aguilera de la Paz told EFE. During his meetings 
with Uruguayan politicians, Robaina will discuss the latest 
Cuban Government measures to legalize private economic 
activities and his country's willingness to receive investments 
from Latin American entrepreneurs. 
  While visiting the Latin American capitals, Robaina will 
discuss arrangements for the next Ibero-American summit to be 
held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia) next June. Aguilera de la 
Paz said Cuba believes it is important for this summit to 
reiterate its condemnation of the embargo on trade against Cuba 
maintained by the United States. The previous Ibero-American 
summit held in Salvador, Bahia, (Brazil) last year condemned 
this embargo, but in a very tenuous manner. 
  The Cuban ambassador added: "Latin American support against 
the embargo may be becoming stronger. It will foster Cuba's 
political and economic integration into the hemisphere." He 
added: "Second, as a bloc, it will exert pressure on the U.S. 
Government, convincing it that the embargo is an obsolete policy 
that will lead nowhere." 
  Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle will receive the 
Cuban foreign minister, who will also meet with left-wing 
leaders from the Broad Front, namely Montevideo Mayor Tabare 
Vasquez -- his party's presidential candidate -- and the 
renowned General Liber Seregni. Aguilera de la Paz pointed out 
that Robaina will not be able to meet former President Julio 
Maria Sanguinetti -- who is the social democratic Colorado 
Party's presidential candidate in this year's election -- as he 
will not be in the country at that time. 
  Robaina's visit to Latin America will be followed by another 
tour of other countries in the hemisphere, about which he 
declined to comment. This is part of an overall diplomatic 
offensive launched by Cuba, which has recently taken the foreign 
minister to Asia and which will take him to other European 
nations, including Spain. 
  Aguilera de la Paz explained that Robaina, 38, "has given 
greater impetus to Cuban foreign policy" since he assumed the 
foreign affairs portfolio last year. Aguilera de la Paz, like 
Robaina, comes from the communist youth. He entered the 
diplomatic service under the new foreign minister. 
  Asked if Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's accession to 
the 
OAS General Secretariat would favor Cuba's rejoining this 
organization, Aguilera de la Paz replied that "Cuba is not eager 
to return to the OAS." He said: "We maintain, to a certain 
extent, a passive attitude on this issue. We have not asked to 
rejoin the OAS but we are sure that it will happen although we 
do not know how long it will take."

<F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa has described the 
authors of articles published in the international media as 
misinformed. These articles have harshly criticized the economic 
plan that President Rafael Caldera's government plans to 
implement. 
  In a document released to the press, Sosa reiterates the 
government's efforts to deal with the fiscal deficit. 
Recognition is given to Democratic Action for granting the 
president special powers in the Special Powers Law. Regarding 
this law, Sosa said that the government believes it is 
convenient to include -- in addition to the tax laws -- the law 
on concessions for public works and services, reform of the 
Emergency Law, and limited reform of the Basic Budget Law that 
would simplify the drawing up and implementation of the nation's 
budget. The finance minister insisted on the importance of tax 
reform. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] That plan obviously includes the 
overall reform of the state, monetary stabilization, and the 
reduction of interest rates. But if we are unable to solve the 
fiscal deficit, we will never be able to control inflation. 
Without control of inflation, there will be no solution of other 
matters. Now, if there are some economic experts who have 
another formula, I have indicated at the end that all 
observations and contributions made in good faith are welcome. 
[end recording] 
  With regard to tax collection, the treasury minister was 
asked if there would be an extension for filing tax returns as 
the deadline approaches. There are problems with the payroll 
lists, through which the forms are distributed. Sosa said he 
understands that the tax collection authority has agreed to a 
30-day extension.

<F P=106> [Second of two parts of "Exclusive" interview with </F>
Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of the 200 Revolutionary 
Bolivarian Movement, by Carlos Fernandez in Caracas; date not 
given; from the "Informer" newscast; broadcast in progress -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Fernandez] ...for instance, do you think that what 
you called a government plan on 4 February 1992 is still valid? 
  [Chavez] Some components of the plan are still valid; for 
example, the national constituent assembly. I repeat, we were 
carrying in our combat bags all the experience gained from the 
constituent assembly. One of the first measures that a 
civilian-military government board was going to adopt was to 
summon a constituent assembly within a reasonable period of 
time. Currently, this is more valid than ever. 
  [Fernandez] At times you have indicated that some civilians 
were going to support you, but we never knew who they were. The 
purpose of this interview is not to tell us who they were, but 
do these civilians continue to identify themselves with the 
Bolivarian Movement in 1994? 
  [Chavez] I believe that some of them no longer support us. I 
think that some of them had the wrong impression that the 
Bolivarian military members were somewhat similar to the 
military members of 1945, who were manipulated by politicians... 
  [Fernandez, interrupting] The politics of opportunity. 
  [Chavez] Exactly, the politics of opportunity. They wanted 
us 
to join their political organizations. This was never our 
intention. I believe that some of them are still following the 
same direction and ideological strategy. We have kept in 
contact with them, and we will increase the communication 
channels now that we are able to do it. 
  [Fernandez] I think that you are going to reinforce debates; 
that is, the debate of ideas and specific issues that will help 
the country solve the socioeconomic and, especially, the moral 
crises that we are currently facing. 
  [Chavez] Yes, I agree. 
  [Fernandez] For instance, without worsening the conflict, 
you 
will consult with AD [Democratic Action], Copei [Social 
Christian Party], MAS [Movement Toward Socialism], Radical Cause 
Party, National Convergence, and a number of groups that are 
part of the Venezuelan political arena. 
  [Chavez] I really do not know how many ideas I have proposed 
so far and how many questions I answered at the lengthy news 
conference. All these ideas are proposed with discussion in 
mind. Not long ago, I met with some deputies of the National 
Congress, and I told them let us talk. Mr. Moron, a church 
representative of course, I was thinking about calling him. I 
once told this government that I did not know if he was going to 
accept. He replied that he refused to be with God and with the 
devil at the same time. A few weeks ago, however, we met at the 
Military Hospital and I asked him what the church's opinion was. 
I said that priests and recently retired military officials 
should hold talks. I always say that we are still active in the 
people's rank and file; I cannot talk about retirement because 
there is no such thing. We are moving forward with the national 
situation. In short, this is the idea: to reveal our plans to 
ensure that we can discuss or criticize them and reach a 
national consensus. 
  [Fernandez] Let us close this interview with a thought. 
Chavez must have listened, read, and examined a number of 
assessments that have emerged in the media in the last few 
weeks. Suddenly, the instability prompted by a coup is 
returning. Copei President Hilarion Cardozo sparked a 
controversy surrounding this issue. He said that there were 
individuals involved in the 27 February or 4 November coups who 
were probably hitting the streets to promote their 
insurrectionist movement. He also accused certain parties of 
performing illegal actions in our country and of being involved 
with the Bolivarian Movement. What do you think about this? 
What is this issue that has been manipulated lately that is 
once more bringing instability to our country? 
  [Chavez] I indeed believe that the country's situation is 
still unstable. Let us hope that the Caldera government and 
team will be able to infuse acceptable levels of stability to 
the national, economic, military, political, and social country. 
  [Fernandez] Are you going to contribute to this? 
  [Chavez] We want to talk and make proposals. In my 
briefcase, 
I carry a number of proposals that, as a soldier, I wanted to 
make to the commander in chief, but it was impossible. 
  [Fernandez] When are you meeting with the commander in 
chief; 
that is, with the president? 
  [Chavez] It is unknown for the time being. We were supposed 
to hold a meeting before my release, but we could not meet. We 
now have to wait and see how the situation develops. We are 
indeed willing to meet and we have the channels to recommend to 
the president and to the Armed Forces, from which we came from, 
some measures that we believe could contribute to the recovery 
of the [word indistinct]. 
  [Fernandez] What about Hilarion's coup? 
  [Chavez] Coups d'etat are unannounced in Latin America. It 
is not that they are justifiable, but they are always the 
product of a situation. I believe that at this moment -- I was 
telling Jose Vicente that I cannot predict the future -- there 
are no conditions to stage a coup. 
  [Fernandez] If I remember well, in [Interior Minister] Ramon 
Escovar Salom's speech to the National Congress two weeks ago, 
there was a reference to latent subversive factors that could 
conspire against democratic stability because we have a very 
fragile stability. There was much talk about groups linked to 
the Venezuelan financial sector because the Banco Latino crisis 
could inspire some people in the military ranks to embrace an 
insurgency movement. 
  [Chavez] I do not think this is possible. I mean, it is 
possible that the wish is there. 
  [Fernandez] Of course, some sectors are wishing this. 
  [Chavez] No, these sectors are definitely wishing. I believe 
the military is currently tasked with finding an internal 
consolidation to show the political world and the Venezuelan 
nation how it is willing to defend the Constitution and to grant 
a waiting period hoping that the country, Mr. Caldera, will 
embark on a new era and that you will be the steering wheel that 
will lead the vessel to a safe haven.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  The possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten 
its 
monetary policies and increase interest rates in the short term 
once again made the prices of Venezuelan foreign debt bonds 
decrease to the same level reached on 27 November 1992, a coup 
day. Chemical Bank reports indicate that the price of foreign 
debt bonds fell by four points and closed at 53.50 points. There 
is also a possibility that U.S. T-bills, whose profitability 
registered 6.97 percent, will continue to decrease. On 21 March, 
all these scenarios combined made the Caracas Stock Exchange 
index lose 3.6 percent and close at 24,654.82 points, which is a 
level similar to that reached on 16 August 1992. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 22 Mar 94 p E-1) 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela, BCV, is offering a record 
amount of 50 billion bolivares worth of zero-coupon bonds. About 
40 billion bolivares will mature in 90 days, and the remaining 
10 billion bolivares will mature in 182 days. The 
90-day-zero-coupon bonds registered a 52.13 percent 
return-on-equity, ROE, rate, which in turn will make fluctuating 
interest rates increase. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 9) 
  Ferrominera Orinoco and Edelca, subsidiaries of the 
Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, CVG, will not be included in the 
privatization process that the Executive Branch is promoting. 
CVG President Francisco Layrisse said Caroni Aluminum Inc. is 
the only subsidiary that in six months, at the latest, will sell 
55 percent of its stock to private companies. As for Ferrominera 
Orinoco, the private sector will only have access to invest in 
the iron transformation process. Ferrominera Orinoco President 
Andres Caleca said the law stipulates that only the state has 
the right to tap iron. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network 
in Spanish 1550 GMT 23 Mar 94) 
  The BCV's Board of Directors has decided to modify the 
mechanisms that control interest rates on loans. For instance, 
it decreased the ceiling rate that banks can charge with 
fluctuating interest rates from 20 to 15 points above the ROE 
rate on zero-coupon bonds. It is worth mentioning that the six 
largest banks currently charge an average fluctuating interest 
rate of 63.8 percent. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 24 Mar 
94 p 1-1) 
  The European Union's Nomenclature Committee recently decided 
to categorize Orimulsion as a bituminous substance. This 
decision opens new opportunities to sell larger amounts of this 
type of fuel to world markets. Frank Alcock, Venezuela 
Petroleum, Petroven, acting president, appeared before the 
Senate's Energy and Mines Commission and said that this new 
category for Orimulsion will prevent a reduction of its 
competitive edge in the Old Continent. The Council on Customs 
Affairs will issue its final ruling on Orimulsion on 4 April. 
Orimulsion exports amounted to 721,000 tons in 1992 and 2.79 
million tons in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 24 Mar 94 
p E-6) 
  On 23 March, Petroven Acting President Fred Alcock said 
Petroven will reduce expenses in 1994 by an additional 6 billion 
bolivares. He added that this reduction will bring to the 
treasury additional revenues amounting to 26 billion bolivares. 
Alcock appeared before the Senate's Energy and Mines Commission 
to explain Petroven's business plan. He also said that Venezuela 
will continue to sell gasoline to the United States. (Caracas EL 
DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest 
rates has landed a heavy blow on the already vulnerable 
Venezuelan economy because the price of its foreign debt bonds 
will drop. This means, however, that the risk to investment 
could fall, which in turn could attract more capital to the 
country. In short, the loss generated by lower prices on foreign 
debt bonds could be compensated by reinvesting said bonds on 
securities with higher interest rates as long as the bonds 
mature in the short term. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8) 
  Carlos Pulido Salvatierra, Association of Venezuelan 
Exporters president, said nontraditional Venezuelan exports to 
Colombia amounted to $500 million during the first quarter of 
1994. He added that it is expected that said exports will amount 
to almost $2 billion in 1994, which is 40 percent higher than in 
1993. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2038 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  The Finance Ministry estimates that the 1995 budget will 
amount to 1.7 trillion bolivares and that gasoline prices will 
increase in 1995. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said the 
mass transit system may receive additional subsidies in 1995. 
Jorge Serrano, vice president of the Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Fedecamaras, 
underscored that gasoline prices must drastically change because 
gasoline receives 40 billion bolivares worth of subsidies 
annually. The Fedecamaras believes that the price of high-octane 
gasoline must increase. (Caracas Venezolana de Television 
Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  New Petroven Director Luis Giusti has said Petroven reduced 
its investment costs by $4 billion due to drops in hydrocarbon 
prices. He added that Petroven reduced other expenses by $3 
billion. Giusti pointed out that there is an international 
consensus on the opening of the national oil industry to private 
capital and that oil prices will not recover soon. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0118 GMT 29 Mar 94)

  [Editorial Report] Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish at 
2300 GMT on 25 March reports that mining officials have 
announced that Ecuador is preparing to launch an "aggressive 
mining development" strategy with foreign funds. Santiago 
Cordovez, president of the Mining Chamber, pointed out that 
foreign mining companies plan to invest approximately $15 
million for exploration in 1994. If successful, plans call for 
over $20 million to be invested in exploitation by 1995.

<F P=106> [From the "Farewell to Arms" column by Carlos Tapia: "Peace </F>
Accord: And the Government's Voice?"] 
  [Text] It would seem President Fujimori likes to announce 
important aspects of the government's counter-subversive 
strategy when he goes abroad. We have learned from the answers 
he gave Chilean journalists that the terrorists sentenced to 
life imprisonment will, under no circumstances, be released and 
that within the framework of the Peace Accord there will be no 
negotiated future integration of any subversive organization 
into the legal political spectrum. 
  Unless our memory fails us, during a news conference he gave 
during recent trip to Colombia, Fujimori again denied that any 
advantage will be granted to the Shining Path members currently 
in prison and who wanted to hold their Second Congress. 
  This column has evaluated the Shining Path's internal 
letters 
and documents, circulated with the approval of the SIN [National 
Intelligence Service]. Because these documents acknowledge the 
achievement of progress within the Peace Accord, a reflection on 
the president's remarks is required. 
  His remarks would seem at first glance to be an open and 
public denial of the progress that has been achieved and the 
provisos that have been reached between the president's emissary 
(Agent 002) and the Shining Path leadership in that "... 
prisoners of war and political prisoners will be released one at 
a time whether or not they have been sentenced." This is 
indicated in one of the clauses of the Accord that is being 
discussed inside the prisons. The possibility of holding the 
Second Congress has also been discarded. The document containing 
the summons for this congress was published in full some weeks 
ago by LA REPUBLICA. 
  If this assumption is true, then the Feliciano Group 
argument, which consider the Peace Accord negotiations to be 
government "rubbish," are fully strengthened. Thus, the 
president's remarks scrap the SIN's "psycho-social" maneuver -- 
or at least end it -- and therefore the planned objective has 
been achieved, in other words, the uncovering of the split that 
occurred within Shining Path. 
  Another hypothesis could be applied: That the 
"psycho-social" 
objective of the president's remarks is to confuse and thereby 
hide the real intentions and exact content of the negotiations 
with the imprisoned terrorists. This would not be the first time 
one thing has been said and the contrary implemented. 
  In view of the importance, responsibility, and cost to be 
endured, we believe the topic of peace in the country should be 
discussed within the sphere of a great national consensus that 
can overcome daily disagreements between the opposition and the 
official sector. One condition alone is needed for this: Crystal 
clarity over what is said and what is done. This is a simple 
duty that should be taken up by all Peruvians who want a true 
peace, in other words, eternal peace.

  [Text] Yesterday, Foreign Minister Efrain Goldenberg 
Schreiber, president of the Council of Ministers, said that 
Peru's geographical diversity plus recent changes in investment 
and commerce laws are important advantages that it can offer 
investors over other Pacific basin nations. Goldenberg today 
participated in the first day of sessions of the 10th General 
Conference of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC). 
  Goldenberg was the first speaker at the conference's opening 
meeting in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. The conference 
will continue today with discussions on capital and financial 
markets in Latin America. Goldenberg will be the main speaker. 
He stressed that Peru has Amazon and Andean regions and a long 
Pacific Ocean coastline. He said this is an interesting option 
for investors. 
  He met yesterday with government officials present at the 
conference. He talked with Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Sri 
Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamed and with the U.S. Security Council 
Asian affairs senior adviser with whom he reviewed prospects for 
regional cooperation, promotion, and investment. Goldenberg also 
met with the Indonesian representative. He delivered a Peruvian 
Government invitation to President Suharto to visit Peru. 
  During today's session, besides the discussion on capital 
and 
financial markets in Latin America, there will be a forum on 
international commerce that will be presided over by Eduardo 
Ferrero Costa, a member of the Peruvian delegation and head of 
the Peruvian National Committee for the Pacific Basin.

  [Text] The "Apoyo" survey company on 20 March confirmed 
that President Alberto Fujimori is losing popularity. "Apoyo's" 
survey results show that Fujimori currently is behind Javier 
Perez de Cuellar in popularity, as the firm Mercadeo &amp; 
Opinion 
reported on 20 March in an article published by LA REPUBLICA in 
its Sunday magazine. 
  This time "Apoyo" gives Perez de Cuellar a 44 percent 
support 
rating while Fujimori gets 40 percent. Mercadeo &amp; Opinion 
established that 47 percent of eligible voters would support the 
former U.N. secretary general while 38 percent would support 
Fujimori. Fujimori's support rating is the lowest since he was 
sworn in on 28 July 1990. 
  The survey by "Apoyo," however, obtains different results 
when people are asked about the president's performance. A total 
of 61 percent of those questioned approve Fujimori's performance 
while only 30 percent disapprove it. This means that many of 
those who support Fujimori in general terms would choose Perez 
de Cuellar as the presidential successor despite the fact that 
the illustrious diplomat is staying away from the electoral 
infighting and still has not said if he will accept an eventual 
nomination for the presidency of the Republic. 
  The "Apoyo" survey also shows other interesting results in 
regards to other possible candidates who might run against 
Fujimori if he runs for reelection. Fujimori would defeat 
Ricardo Belmont 49 percent to 26 percent; Fernando Belaunte 
Terry, 54 percent to 20 percent; and Luis Caceres, 55 percent to 
17 percent. If voters have to choose between several candidates 
at the same time, Fujimori also will win. "Apoyo" says that in 
this case Fujimori would obtain 40 percent; Perez de Cuellar, 30 
percent; Belmont, 10 percent; and Belaunte, 6 percent. 
  All this figures were aired on 20 March during the news 
program "Panorama" broadcast by Channel 5. The data probably 
will be analyzed and discussed by politicians and the people in 
general.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the "Observer" column by Mirko Lauder: </F>
"Tremors on the Lima Fault"] 
  [Text] Whether it is with 44 percent (in the poll by Apoyo 
Inc.) or 47 percent (in the poll by M&amp;O) of Lima voters' 
preferences, the popularity of Javier Perez de Cuellar is 
beginning to cause a certain degree of perplexity, and not 
because he might not deserve such percentages, but rather 
because these figures might reveal something more than simple 
support for his political figure. Perez de Cuellar appears to 
embody a growing search for an alternative to Alberto Fujimori. 
  Yet underneath Perez de Cuellar's growing electoral 
popularity other things are happening. The most important are 
perhaps the simultaneous appearances in the M&amp;O poll of 
Fernando 
Belaunde, with 16 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes, with 10 
percent of voters' preferences, while between 29 and 31 percent 
of those polled preferred to remain undecided rather than voice 
support for Fujimori. 
  Some clear conclusions may be drawn from the latest polls, 
especially from that of M&amp;O and earlier ones conducted by 
Imasen. The first is that party figures have improved their 
standings, but not to the point of being perceived as 
alternatives. Yet no one should minimize the 16 percent obtained 
by Belaunde, simply through hard work, province meetings, and 
statements, with very few televised appearances. 
  Another lesson is that in a clean election, Javier Perez de 
Cuellar -- if he wants to -- would be the next president. The 
preference of voters in Lima has gone beyond rational estimates, 
and to this extent it has eroded the argument that his 
popularity could collapse during a hectic electoral campaign. 
We are entering ground similar to that held by Fujimori in 
1990, or to that of the no-vote in 1993. 
  Another evident lesson is that Fujimori continues to lose in 
Lima, which has been his stronghold, and therefore he would also 
be losing his position as leader in the first round in 1995. 
Some people claim that Fujimori expected this loss, and that it 
will be compensated for through votes that will be recovered in 
key provinces. Yet these provinces still appear to be mobilized 
against him rather than for him. 
  The unusual sight of leading foreign and domestic 
businessmen 
trading their own as well as state assets is not exciting 
Peruvian voters. On the contrary, it appears that such trade is 
perceived only as something that is happening while jobs and 
salaries continue to decline. No one is associating the 
expression "social expenses" with the word "job." 
  Going back to the polls, it is no longer surprising to note 
that while Fujimori maintains his popularity, the voters' 
preference for him has declined. The people want Fujimori to 
reach 1995, but not 1996. The fact of the matter is that now 
that the elections are 12 months away, the figures that count 
now are those concerning voters preferences, not popularity 
rates. 
  In other words the electoral campaign is, already in its 
initial stage, worsening the power vacuum that forced Fujimori 
into military tutelage. Someone might say that we have already 
had a military coup. The fear persists, however, that Fujimori 
may want to use the force of arms to compensate for his loss of 
popular support. Thirteen days before the second anniversary of 
the Fujimori-Hermoza coup, this thought can only be worrisome.

  [Text] Quito, 28 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran Foreign 
Minister Diego Paredes expressed satisfaction today over the 
election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary 
general. 
  In a message issued at the OAS office in Washington, Paredes 
said he is "proud to have supported the Colombian president's 
candidacy, given the exceptional relationship between our two 
countries. We are proud because our support has been a 
demonstration and a reflection of the sentiments of affection 
the Ecuadoran people have toward Colombia and its president, 
Cesar Gaviria." 
  In February the government of Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen announced its commitment to support the Costa Rican 
candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. Ecuador maintained 
its support for Costa Rica until a few days before the election. 
Last Friday [25 March] it changed its position in favor of the 
Colombian candidate, who was elected Sunday [27 March] with 20 
votes. Niehaus received 14 votes. 
  In his message, Paredes also congratulated the Costa Rican 
candidate "for his lofty and dignified campaign." He said it was 
a pleasure for the Ecuadoran delegation to adhere to the 
expressions of affection and recognition of the work carried out 
by outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, who has 
headed the organization for the past 10 years. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 2130 GMT on 28 March carries a 
report saying that "the Ecuadoran Government expressed surprise 
today over Colombia's economic measures against Ecuadoran 
exporters and stressed that the announcement was made when 
Ecuador `gave its clear and definitive support to (Colombian) 
President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy for OAS secretary general.'"]

<F P=106> [Article by Nelson Luiz de Oliveira from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] During a briefing session before the Senate's 
Economic Affairs Committee on 24 March, Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Central Bank (BC) President Pedro 
Malan acknowledged for the first time that the BC had made 
secret transactions since last November. These transactions 
involved the purchase of $2.8 billion in securities to be used 
as collateral for the agreement with creditor banks. 
  According to Cardoso, the absolute secrecy with which the 
transactions were made was due to the need to "protect the 
country from speculators." Malan, who suggested the securities' 
purchase to Cardoso, explained to senators that the government 
deemed it advisable to hedge against a possible U.S. Treasury 
refusal to place a special issue of securities for Brazil on the 
market -- which was what indeed occurred. 
  The Senate -- which is co-responsible for negotiating the 
rescheduling of Brazil's external debt -- was not notified of 
the transactions made by the BC on the secondary international 
markets. According to Cardoso, only himself, Malan, and BC 
Foreign Area Director Gustavo Franco knew about the "hedge" 
[preceding word in English] (protection) strategy. The minister 
neither said nor was asked whether President Itamar Franco was 
informed about the collateral's secret purchase. 
  Cardoso authorized the BC to purchase collateral last 
October 
or November on the condition that the securities constituted a 
good deal regardless of their possible use in the 
debt-rescheduling agreement. A source close to the BC reported 
that the 30-year-maturity U.S. T-bills that were purchased had 
been on the market for some time. 
  Senators voiced distrust about this event until 23 March. 
Senator Espiridiano Amin (PPR-SC) [Progressive Renewal 
Party-Santa Catarina] went as far as accusing Cardoso of using 
the debt-rescheduling agreement for electoral purposes. On 24 
March, however, the atmosphere was calm again and all the 
members of Congress questioned endorsed Cardoso's decision not 
to disclose details about the transactions -- cost and interest 
rate -- before reaching an agreement with creditor banks on 15 
April. 
  According to Senator Jose Focaga (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], rapporteur of 
Resolution No. 96 that ratified the agreement's terms, the 
T-bills' secret purchase does not harm the Senate's guidance. 
Malan believes the agreement approved by senators did not 
entail the U.S. Treasury's special issue. 
  Malan termed "pure speculation" estimates to the effect that 
the BC had to pay between $60 million and $80 million more for 
the collateral as a result of purchasing it directly on the 
market. According to Malan, speculators were not able to detect 
the BC action in time. In any case, Malan considered it much 
more important that the BC strategy enabled working out an 
agreement with creditor banks. Malan made it clear that the U.S. 
Treasury will not issue T-bills especially for Brazil unless the 
latter reaches an agreement with the IMF.

<F P=106> [Statement by Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the </F>
National Executive Committee of the Mexican Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, at the party headquarters in Mexico City -- 
live] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Today, Tuesday, 29 March 1994, 
I have summoned the CEN [National Executive Committee] of the 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] in order to appoint our 
party's candidate for the Presidency of the republic. We do this 
by virtue of the powers granted to the CEN in Article 159 of our 
statutes and by the powers granted to political parties in 
Article 41 of the Political Constitution of the United States of 
Mexico. 
  We are gathered here today, united in the purpose of giving 
continuity and validity to the postulates of the Mexican 
Revolution. We are gathered here today, deeply moved and aware 
of our responsibility to Mexico. 
  At this time, we are strengthened by Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
undying course of action. Attentive to the Mexico he saw, deeply 
convinced of the reason as well as the political and human 
validity of the ideals he offered the nation, PRI members must 
continue along the path he outlined for us with his thoughts and 
example. 
  All of Mexico is in mourning and PRI members are offended. 
This ideological and political legacy, however, is also a 
commitment for undertaking new tasks. In the PRI, we must 
continue with his campaign for the sake of democracy and social 
justice, our party's slogans which Luis Donaldo gave new meaning 
and deep projections. 
  The National Executive Committee unanimously appoints our 
companion and friend, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, as the PRI 
candidate for the presidency of the republic. [applause] 
  Ernesto Zedillo is a great member of our party. He is well 
acquainted with Luis Donaldo Colosio's thinking, a politician 
committed to the theories and principles of our party and to 
this campaign's political platform. 
  Ernesto Zedillo is the best man we have to lead the PRI's 
efforts to win the elections on 21 August. This appointment is 
also fully supported by our governors and by members of our 
party in the country's many states. They joined the CEN in 
signing this appointment. We are convinced that Ernesto Zedillo 
is the best member of the PRI; he is the person to whom Luis 
Donaldo Colosio entrusted the coordination of his campaign. 
  We, the members of the CEN, are certain that Ernesto Zedillo 
has the boldness and conviction to continue on the path that 
Luis Donaldo Colosio initiated. As I stand before the general 
public and our party members, I wish to reaffirm the ideals and 
positions [banderas] the party is raising in this campaign. The 
profound injustice that has caused Luis Donaldo Colosio to 
disappear from our midst cannot be tolerated, nor, 
unfortunately, can it be repaired. The proposal he set forth to 
the Mexican people, however, remains alive. 
  Today, PRI members entrust to Ernesto Zedillo the leadership 
of the PRI's efforts in the electoral race. If the Mexican 
people freely and sovereignly so decide, the PRI's national 
ideals, Colosio's pledges, his plans, and the services he 
rendered to the Mexican people will become law and a way of 
government. We know that the future of the fatherland demands 
unity, devotion, and loyalty. 
  The PRI is hereby resuming its campaign to win the people's 
vote of conviction. It is resuming its campaign for change with 
responsibility and direction. The PRI is resuming its campaign 
for democracy and social justice. We are going for victory and 
the progress the Mexican people are demanding; we are going for 
the democracy that all Mexicans hope for; we are going for 
victory with Ernesto Zedillo. A united PRI will confirm that it 
has the strength to conquer, to win by convincing society, to 
fulfill the national plan the Mexican people want. Let us 
achieve victory, united and strong with Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de 
Leon. [applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential </F>
candidate for the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary Party, at 
the party's national headquarters in Mexico City -- live] 
  [Text] Companion and friend, Fernando Ortiz Arana, 
distinguished president of the National Executive Committee 
[CEN] of our party, the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]; 
sector leaders; members of the CEN; governors of the states in 
the republic; PRI members, all convinced of our victory: 
  With mournful spirit, but with my deepest determination and 
with my most sincere humility, I accept the serious 
responsibility that the CEN of our party grants to me. I accept 
it fully aware of the fact that the best man to take the PRI to 
victory and the country to fulfill its aspirations was, at all 
times, Luis Donaldo Colosio. [applause] 
  With him, we Mexicans were preparing to consolidate and 
extend the historic work of modernization begun by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. [applause] Luis Donaldo Colosio had 
built genuine leadership in our party, and his message of hope 
was already in the hearts of all Mexicans, in all corners of the 
fatherland. Luis Donaldo Colosio was a good, self-made man who 
formed an exemplary family and knew how to earn the respect and 
appreciation of his fellow party members and of everyone who 
knew him. Luis Donaldo Colosio represented for Mexico the 
certainty of a future he dreamt about and those of us who dreamt 
with him. Luis Donaldo Colosio was the best man for Mexico. 
  I accept this responsibility knowing that we PRI members 
will 
not begin a campaign; we will continue the campaign. We know PRI 
members already have an exact diagnosis for the national 
problems, which was prepared by the foresight of Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. We know we PRI members already have a political offer 
that goes beyond any other, as far as popular support and shared 
purposes are concerned. Luis Donaldo promised to build the best 
electoral proposal and to take it to the citizens. Luis Donaldo 
kept his promise. 
  That is Luis Donaldo Colosio's generous legacy. In this 
legacy, the members of the PRI and all Mexicans will find 
guiding principles, a political platform, programmatic 
proposals, slogans, and goals. We will honor the legacy of what 
Luis Donaldo Colosio heard from our fellow Mexicans, of what 
Luis Donaldo Colosio learned from his coexistence with men, 
women, and children throughout the country. This legacy is what 
Luis Donaldo Colosio characterized as a political strategy after 
listening to the Mexican people's voices and after pledging to 
heed those voices. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio always pledged to listen to and heed 
the 
people, and it is our duty to honor his convictions, display his 
causes, and fulfill his goals. At this hour, before those who 
shared Luis Donaldo's ideals and work, before our party comrades 
and all Mexicans, I reaffirm my unequivocal conviction that 
respect for the Constitution of the republic is our best 
political weapon. 
  I firmly believe that the political Constitution sums up the 
Mexican people's struggles and that from it flow the ideals that 
we share. The Constitution contains the principles that allow 
the state to deal with economic, social, and political problems, 
leaving in its solutions the traces of our identity as a nation. 
The Constitution goes beyond the juridical sense of its precepts 
to become an expression of our history. That is why I believe 
respect for the Constitution is a condition for preserving 
sovereignty and ensuring the free and civilized coexistence of a 
nation like ours which is rich in its plurality. 
  As a Mexican and as a PRI member, I believe the enforcement 
of the de jure state sums up the people's mandate. Thus, we must 
all respect its institutions, adhere to its legal instruments, 
and obey its ordinances. 
  Scarcely a few days ago, only a few steps away from here, 
Luis Donaldo Colosio invoked Benito Juarez's thoughts; the 
lessons learned from his work, from his great passion for 
Mexico, his struggle for national sovereignty, and his concept 
of the law as something most sacred. To live in a de jure state 
is to live with security, to have confidence and to settle our 
differences peacefully and with equality of rights. The 
enforcement of the de jure state is possible only if justice 
prevails above all else. The de jure state and the imparting of 
justice are inseparable. 
  Injustice and insecurity disrupt the state of law and 
hinder the participation and activities of the citizens. 
Consequently, I add my voice to the clamor of my fellow party 
members and the demand of society at large: We demand that the 
crime that took the life of Luis Donaldo Colosio be completely 
clarified. [applause] This is an indispensable step for 
restoring the public security that all Mexicans deserve and for 
restoring public belief in the administration of justice. This 
is a human, social, and party demand that is necessary for the 
health of the republic. Every single Mexican is demanding 
justice. 
  Before my fellow party members, today I reaffirm my PRI 
conviction. The PRI always has been and will continue to be the 
party of Mexico's sovereignty and independence; the party of the 
Mexican people's historic struggles and popular causes; the 
party of hope and trust; the party of the majority and of 
progress. This is why the PRI chose Luis Donaldo Colosio as its 
candidate to the presidency of the Republic. 
  In Luis Donaldo Colosio, we of the PRI had someone to bear 
the standard of our ideals and aspirations, to defend our values 
and principles, and to promote equality, welfare, and justice. 
He was the standard bearer of a party that came from the widest 
breadth of society and from the very depths of our history; a 
party that has contributed decisively to building a strong and 
stable nation; a party that has promoted the modernization of 
the past few years; a party that is deeply committed to 
democracy; a party that knows how to earn its legitimacy and win 
over the majority with daily actions, by identifying with the 
people, and with the work of all of its members. 
  The PRI made Luis Donaldo Colosio its candidate because he 
represented the consolidation of stability and internal peace, 
of economic growth and the multiplication of opportunities. 
Thanks to the boost given by Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI is 
marching toward a new stage in the political transformation of 
Mexico; toward a party that is fully prepared for political 
competition; a party that can struggle within the law, in a 
clean and correct manner, for each vote and for each victory. 
  The great work done by Luis Donaldo Colosio in the PRI was 
permanently inspired by his deep democratic convictions. Luis 
Donaldo promoted democracy in all the spheres of political life. 
Consequently, Luis Donaldo yearned for clearly democratic 
elections and for regulations that would grant full autonomy to 
and secure the impartiality of our electoral organizations. 
That is why he worked hard for the agreement for peace, 
democracy, and justice, and promoted consensus-building with 
other parties -- something that was unprecedented in Mexico's 
political history. 
  He was always the first one to seek confidence, trust, 
regularity, and clarity in the electoral process. Luis Donaldo 
Colosio knew that the building of democracy is a permanent task 
that requires everyone's participation. Democracy requires a 
continuous effort, based on a genuinely shared desire to always 
advance, always improve, and always struggle for the purest 
values of political life until the democratic aspiration of all 
Mexicans are fully realized. 
  In the past few months, Luis Donaldo Colosio toured the 
country, visited communities, approached families, and made the 
people's just and old demands, as well as old wrongs, his own. 
This is the Mexico that penetrated his conscience, the one that 
guided his campaign, and inspired his platform. This Mexico 
would take him to victory because he identified himself with the 
workers who demand well paid jobs, training, and ample social 
security for their families. In this Mexico, he identified 
himself with the poor peasants, who struggle so their productive 
capacity can make the rural medium play a decisive role in the 
country's progress. In this Mexico, Colosio testified about the 
cohesion and millenial identities of the Indian communities, 
which demand justice in exchange for believing and participating 
in the new greatness of their land. In this Mexico, Colosio 
reasserted his respect for Mexican women's equal rights and the 
place they deserve in the construction of the Mexican nation's 
future. In this Mexico, Colosio saw and understood the young 
people, who demand a quality education and opportunities to 
apply their energy, talents, eagerness, and uprightness to the 
work at hand. For all of them, Colosio represented true hope, a 
hope to participate, a chance to work and prosper. 
  For this reason, the PRI affirmed itself as the party of the 
majority through Colosio. And Colosio's party will continue to 
be the party of the majority because it offers changes with 
responsibility, a course for progress, welfare with instability. 
Colosio's leadership made the PRI the party of democratic 
transformation. Colosio called for reforming power. We of the 
PRI will abide by his words. We will reinforce the balance 
between the government branches by expanding the authority of 
the Legislative Branch and strengthening the agencies in charge 
of the administration of justice based on universal principles 
and precepts in agreement with our progress as a nation. We 
will reform power by strengthening federalism as an essential 
principle of the republican pact in recognition of municipal 
freedom and the dignity of each community and individual. 
  We will reach the end of this century with a stronger 
economy, in which stability and growth are based on healthy 
finances, competitiveness, and modernization. The role to be 
played by this economic progress should be family welfare, a 
fair distribution of wealth, and, in particular, a direct attack 
on poverty, which affects many, many millions of Mexicans. We 
will build a Mexico in which each man and woman can develop his 
or her capabilities and potential, where workers, peasants, 
professionals, teachers, employees, students, and entrepreneurs 
can share the hope and stimulus of contributing their efforts to 
participate in progress. 
  Fellow countrymen, we, the Mexican people, are living in a 
time that demands national unity. This is everyone's feeling. 
Today, tragedy has cast our party into mourning. All of Mexico 
shares our grief and a feeling of the offense inflicted. 
Throughout our history, every test and every demand of fate has 
been overcome by the unity of the Mexican people. When this did 
not happened, the homeland suffered the most. At present, we 
should extract from the tragedy a lesson of unity, strength in 
diversity, honesty in political struggle, a brother's respect 
for one another, and political civility. National unity will 
make it possible for us to advance with self-confidence, along a 
well-defined course, and with the determined participation of 
everyone. 
  The same way we PRI members have always called for national 
unity, today I call on my fellow party members to redouble the 
PRI's unity. Let us continue the task initiated by Luis Donaldo 
Colosio by carrying out our tasks, invigorating our 
organization, working and participating with enthusiasm in all 
the trenches our party offers us. 
  This is why, as a PRI member, as a Colosioist, I call on the 
party's rank and file, its organizations, its leaders, and all 
its members to close ranks around the ideals, programs, and 
actions that Luis Donaldo Colosio left us. 
  Upon accepting the responsibility that my fellow party 
members grant me, I am supported by the conviction that every 
woman and every man, each young or mature party member, has a 
place and a duty. The PRI is not an exclusive party; this is why 
it assembles the majority. PRI members can have the certainty 
that our party, your party, will continue to be the political 
institution that will give way to their aspirations, to their 
fighting spirit, to their desire for participation and progress. 
  Today all PRI members have a mission: To take Luis Donaldo 
Colosio's program to electoral victory; make reality the promise 
of that future, of well-being, equality, and justice for which 
he offered his life. We must fulfill our duty and our 
responsibility. I know that in this great task that awaits us, I 
will be able to count on the support and the work of each and 
every party member. I base my acceptance of the PRI presidential 
candidacy on this. Long live Colosio [shouts of vivas]; long 
live the PRI [shouts of vivas]; long live Mexico [shouts of 
vivas]. [applause]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  According to a report by the Comptroller General's Office, 
Panama's public debt totaled $7.228 billion on 31 December 1993. 
The debt is broken down as follows: $1.916 billion, or 27 
percent, is internal public debt; $3.795 billion, or 53 percent, 
is external public debt; and $1.517 billion, or 21 percent, is 
overdue interest and commissions corresponding to the foreign 
public debt, mostly international commercial banks. 
(Percentages are as published.) The document says that the 
amortization of this debt demands the largest disbursements from 
the state's budget, with the exception of the government 
payroll. The country's public debt is 1.1 times larger than the 
1993 GNP, which the Office estimates at $6.5619 billion. In an 
effort to amortize this amount, the government allocated $693 
million in the current fiscal year's budget to service the 
internal and external public debt. This amount is equivalent to 
18 percent of this year's allocation for the public sector's 
operating expenses and to 23 percent of current revenues. 
(Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 22 March 94 p 1A) 
  Victoria Garibaldo, director of the Consular and Shipping 
Department, has reported to ACAN-EFE that so far this year the 
country has received $14.71 million from ship registrations and 
that this amount exceeds by 5.5 percent the amount estimated for 
the first quarter of 1994. She said that Panama leads with 
12,496 registered ships and a gross tonnage that exceeded 77 
million as of 15 January 1994. The department expects to 
collect about $43 million in direct revenues this year. The 
country received $41.33 million in direct revenues last year. In 
addition, indirect revenues from ship registrations amount to 
more $60 million, Garibaldo said. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 
2037 GMT 23 March 94) 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise the daily 
interbank interest rate to 3.50 percent will particularly affect 
those who borrow for consumption, amortize mortages, or 
refinance enterprises. In Panama, the most important effect of 
this decision is that the country will now be negotiating with 
private banks a substantial portion of its debt, more than $2 
billion in principal and close to $1.3 billion in interest. 
Since October 1993, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy 
has raised the cost of Panama's commercial debt by an estimated 
$20 million annually. Arturo Tapia, president of Wall Street 
Securities, has said that the higher interest rates should not 
harm Panama's economic growth because such rates are taken into 
consideration by investors. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 25 March 94 p 1D)

  [Text] San Salvador de Jujuy, 29 Mar (NA) -- Eleven injured 
people, including seven policemen, one of whom is in serious 
condition, and four arrested individuals are the consequences of 
the incidents that took place today at the Jujuy government 
house, following a demonstration by 1,500 public workers and 
teachers who were demanding a wage increase. 
  The serious crisis caused, a few hours afterward, the sudden 
"irreversible" resignation of Minister of Government Antonio 
Paleari, who had harshly criticized provincial Justicialist 
Party deputies, and had questioned the national government for 
adopting a "discriminatory" attitude toward Jujuy in comparison 
with other provinces. 
  Meanwhile, the front of public workers unions decided 
tonight 
to continue the measures of force tomorrow, including a strike 
that will be observed in different ways depending on the unions. 
  For example, high school teachers will not attend classes, 
primary school teachers will work normally, and workers from the 
rest of the unions will cease activities at their workplaces and 
hold assemblies. 
  The incidents began taking place today at noon, when about 
150 demonstrators out of the 1,500 who were participating in the 
protest stoned the government house, broke its windows, and 
hurled several Molotov cocktails and noise bombs. 
  The acts of violence forced the police to disperse the 
rioters with tear gas and rubber bullets, with the support of 
cavalrymen. 
  Soon after, a group of about 50 people headed for the 
private 
home of Governor Jose Carlos Ficoseco, which they stoned, and 
where they broke the windows of his Chevrolet pickup truck and a 
Renault car that was parked there. 
  After normalcy returned, and a little before resigning, 
Minister of Government Paleari blamed the SEOM [expansion 
unknown] and ATE [Association of State Workers] unions, headed 
by Carlos "Perro" Santillan and Fernando Acosta, for the 
outrages. 
  Paleari said that "one of the injured policemen, whose last 
name is Chauqui, is in serious condition as a consequence of the 
explosion in his face of a noise bomb, which made him lose his 
hearing on his left side, while he is in serious danger of 
losing the sight in his left eye." 
  The minister of government also denied that the police who 
had dissolved the demonstration had used live ammunition, 
although he admitted they had used "rubber bullets" besides the 
tear gas. 
  According to Paleari, the civilians who were wounded had 
slight injuries, one of them having received a rubber bullet in 
one of his buttocks. 
  He added that a policewoman was also wounded. Among the four 
arrested individuals, from whom the police confiscated 
"pamphlets with the picture of `Che' Guevara inciting people to 
violence, two of them were totally drunk." 
  The serious situation in this capital today caused "concern" 
in the national government, and Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf 
analyzed the problem with his aides, although it was said that 
"they never considered putting the province into trusteeship." 
  Governor Ficoseco decided to send a draft bill to the 
provincial legislature restructuring the public workers' wages, 
which for the lowest paid workers would represent a 50 percent 
increase. 
  The incidents began happening today at noon, about an hour 
after CTERA [Confederation of Educational Workers of the 
Argentine Republic] workers, headed by their national leader 
Mary Sanchez, began gathering. The CTERA column carried an 
approximately 400 meter long Argentine flag. 
  The rioters hurled inside the government house "at least 
four 
Molotov cocktails" nearly causing a fire that was immediately 
put out, while several other noise bombs exploded. 
  A little after that, the provincial police and cavalrymen 
dissolved the rioters by hurling tear gas and shooting rubber 
bullets, after which calmness returned to downtown San Salvador 
de Jujuy. 
  "If national intervention in the province is done to solve 
our problems, let it be welcome," former Minister Paleari told 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, after saying that so far "Ruckauf said 
these were only rumors, and that there is no reason" for 
intervention. 
  Paleari, who at no moment indicated that he would resign, 
said that the "SEOM and ATE unions were the only two public 
unions that rejected an 80 peso wage increase as of April plus 
20 additional pesos in 120 days," and he accused them of 
originating the incidents. 
  Paleari acknowledged that "since 1991 the salaries" of the 
provincial public workers "have been frozen," and he confirmed 
that "some workers earn 123 pesos per month." 
  After reporting on the violent incidents, Paleari officially 
announced at 1930 that he had tendered his "irreversible 
resignation" and that Governor Ficoseco had accepted it, by 
which his post is being temporarily held by Government Secretary 
Alfredo Frias. 
  Provincial government spokesmen believe that "Paleari's 
replacement will be defined tomorrow," adding that "Governor 
Ficoseco plans to travel within the next few hours to the 
federal capital to analyze with national government officials 
the problem" in Jujuy Province.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota -- The lack of payment guarantees 
could cause negotiations for oil sales between Colombia and Cuba 
to fail. According to the government, sales might be possible 
only if Cuba complies with conditions established by Ecopetrol 
[Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] for the sale of crude on the 
international markets. A spokesman for the [word indistinct] 
ministry said no concessions will be made. 
  According to official sources, Cuba has offered to cover the 
cost of the negotiations with sugar, in a three-party 
transaction that is not acceptable to Colombia. The island 
government would reportedly sell sugar -- the island's main 
source of currency -- at low prices to a third country. That 
nation, which has not been further identified, would resell the 
sugar on the international market. With the proceeds from the 
sale, this nation would then pay Colombia for the oil sold to 
Cuba. 
  An official spokesman said: We prefer a letter of credit. As 
long as there are no payment guarantees, there will be no 
negotiations. He explained that until now President Castro's 
government has not made another proposal. The failure of the 
negotiations, which are now practically suspended, would not be 
due to international pressures exerted after the negotiations 
were announced but because Ecopetrol's conditions for 
negotiations of this type have not been met, the government said.

  [Text] Today, the newspaper EL TIEMPO in Bogota, Colombia, 
published a letter from Cuban President Fidel Castro who 
acknowledges the paper's apologies for publishing reports on a 
supposed guerrilla meeting in Cuba. In his letter, which is 
addressed to the newspaper's editor and which was published on 
the front page of the largest Colombian newspaper, the head of 
the Cuban Revolution states that the issue is important and 
serious. The letter adds that the incident could have had 
serious and undesirable repercussions both for the credibility 
of many people and for [words indistinct]. 
  In his letter to the Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO, Fidel 
Castro added that he considers it his duty to express his most 
sincere appreciation for the step taken to deny reports 
published by the same newspaper that were not in keeping with 
the truth, and for the apology to Monsignor Nel Beltran and the 
Cuban Government. 
  Fidel Castro notes that in explaining the incident and 
apologizing to those affected, the newspaper EL TIEMPO has shown 
courage and honesty. We admit this, Fidel Castro said in his 
letter. He added: We accept your apologies and congratulate you, 
the newspaper's board, and the reporters and workers for an 
attitude that exalts us. 
  Fidel Castro concludes his letter to the newspaper EL TIEMPO 
in Bogota, Colombia, with an expression of hope and expectation 
that we will all learn a useful lesson from the unpleasant 
incident and that mutual respect and relations between the 
peoples of Cuba and Colombia will be strengthened.

  [Text] Our commander in chief, Comrade Fidel Castro, 
presided over the plenum of the CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] 
national committee, which for 10 hours discussed the Parliaments 
in the Workplace held throughout Cuba. Fidel pointed out the 
need to implement measures on the topics discussed and called 
the report presented at the meeting by CTC Secretary General 
Pedro Ross Leal very useful and extensive. 
  If we do not achieve economic efficiency, there can be no 
cleanup of the nation's finances; and if there is no 
streamlining of the finances, we will not achieve economic 
efficiency, Fidel said, linking these two basic ideas as two 
parts of a single whole. 
  Castro pointed out that the first decision, to take the 
subject of the economy extensively into the bosom of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], was a 
positive one. Castro pointed out that the second important step 
was to hold these meetings in the workplaces, so that we would 
all have a precise awareness of what is being examined. 
  Fidel said this was a courageous decision on the part of the 
Cuban Revolution, because the country is currently in very 
difficult circumstances; he noted that in other countries this 
kind of thing is sometimes not discussed even in the 
legislatures, among a nation's deputies. Instead, such decisions 
are made by the government and the measures are out on the 
street the next day, with different results. 
  Fidel said: The results of these discussions are very good, 
in our case, very positive; and this is a colossal experience 
which puts us in a position to make everything we do turn out 
much better. Fidel Castro reiterated that the plenum's report 
was objective and at the same time optimistic, and that the 
process has yielded positive results with a high degree of 
efficiency and awareness. 
  The Cuban president said we have been subjected to difficult 
trials, tremendous tests from day one and have confronted them 
with dignity, courage, and patriotism. He pointed out that 
little by little, small advances are being made; now the task is 
to surmount the problems, always keeping in mind that we are not 
going to exit the special period overnight but rather, to the 
extent that we are capable of organizing everything, by working 
and applying measures that are correct in a difficult world. 
  The commander in chief said: The last harvest was a 
difficult 
one. The drop in production was really brutal. Just figure what 
kind of situation we were in, what the situation was for all of 
us who had to confront all this alongside the Cuban people, 
amidst a harvest without fuel, without tires, without spare 
parts. That is why I say that, during this harvest, we must 
effect cane recovery -- and the recovery, too, of the grinding 
and the yields. That is the reason that, during this harvest, 
which is still going on, the workers movement should not drop 
its guard: not in the tobacco harvest, nor the potato harvest, 
nor the sugar harvest, said Fidel. 
  Fidel pointed out that all of this is being done amidst the 
blockade by the United States but that a meeting like this is 
very stimulating, to study now the necessary measures and which 
the workers have discussed, measures that have been made public 
through all the media and of which the people are aware. 
  Fidel reminded the group that certain measures might not be 
popular, but that there is an awareness of this just as there is 
of decriminalization of the dollar -- a measure that was taken 
with full knowledge of its consequences but which was necessary, 
even though the inequalities that have arisen hurt us, and a 
measure about which Fidel himself has spoken publicly on other 
occasions,. 
  Fidel pointed out: In the last analysis, the economic 
cleanup 
is not the most important thing. Rather, the most important 
thing is the awareness that has been achieved, to date, about 
these problems the nation is facing. The measures will be 
discussed at the ANPP, and the ANPP will make the pertinent 
recommendations to the government, which, in the last analysis, 
is the body that has to apply them at the proper time. 
  Castro pointed out the need for the deputies to have all the 
pertinent information, the most important aspects of what has 
been discussed in the Parliaments in the Workplace, because 
everything must be studied carefully, reflected upon carefully. 
There were numerous speeches made during the plenum by the 
members of the CTC's national committee, union leaders, and 
certain ministers and other government officials.

<F P=106> ["Final part of interview" with Lieutenant Colonel (Octavio </F>
Geronez) of the Havana Province Ministry of Interior Office by 
police reporter Alemany; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Alemany] The controls established to prevent the 
theft of agricultural products during the first months of 1994 
will be maintained until the end of the 1994 harvest and even 
after that in order to eradicate all possible channels for 
illegally supplying the underground market with agricultural 
products and allowing the so-called profiteers [macetas] to get 
rich. 
  [(Geronez)] We plan to keep an ensemble of measures after 
the 
conclusion of this campaign. The first thing we are going to do 
is work at the current level of intensity throughout the time 
the harvest is taking place. The harvest is to last until the 
end of April, more or less, possibly through the first days of 
May. After that, we plan to keep up a certain level of 
harassment, with checkpoints on the main roads linking our 
province with the City of Havana and also at certain points 
linking Pinar del Rio Province -- necessarily passing through 
our province -- with the City of Havana. A large quantity of 
products comes from Pinar del Rio and these products need to be 
protected until they reach the product-concentrating market 
[mercado concentrador] and, finally, the local produce market 
[placita]. 
  [Alemany] According to Lt. Col. (Geronez) of the Havana 
Province Ministry of Interior [Minint] Office, all the forces 
responsible for agricultural products' reaching the cold-storage 
facilities and the wholesale and retail produce markets for 
equitable distribution among the population will thoroughly 
carry out their mission to guarantee that the population is 
supplied with foodstuffs. 
  [(Geronez)] We comrades absorbed in this task, in this 
harvest, are working meticulously and arduously so that our 
population can feel secure, can trust that the products 
earmarked for cold-storage facilities will go there; and that 
those earmarked for the product-concentrating markets for direct 
consumption by the population will arrive and reach the people. 
  It is important for all the products earmarked for 
cold-storage facilities to arrive and be stored because that is 
what is going to permit the systematic provisioning of the 
population with an entire series of products throughout the 
year, products that are going to be in short supply because they 
will be out of season, in short supply from the point of view of 
agricultural production, I mean. Because we think that the 
quantities being put into cold storage can guarantee a certain 
level of supply. 
  [Alemany] Lastly, Lt. Col. (Geronez) said Havana Province's 
Minint forces will always fulfill their duty of preventing 
unscrupulous or criminal individuals from continuing to affect 
the security and tranquility of the citizenry. 
  [(Geronez)] It is truly a commitment of ours, all us Minint 
comrades, all our institution's officers corps, troops, and 
auxiliaries, to have those products reach the population, have 
those products contribute to alleviating our country's food 
situation. And we are going to work, struggle, make the greatest 
effort so that our people will feel satisfaction with all the 
work we are doing.

  [Excerpt] Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
has rejected the new U.S. plan aimed at restoring him to power, 
insisting on the need for the military in power to resign as the 
first step of a peace plan in Haiti. It is this strategy that 
will lead to the restoration of democracy in Haiti, Aristide 
explained in a communique issued on 29 March. 
  Aristide was responding to the new U.S. initiative providing 
for the simultaneous appointment of a new prime minister and the 
resignation of the current military government in 
Port-au-Prince, which would get amnesty. This plan also provides 
for strengthening the international trade embargo by reinforcing 
the watch over the border between Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic in order to increase pressure on the military regime. 
  Father Aristide, who was informed of this new plan on 25 
March by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, pointed out that he is 
sticking to the eight-point plan that he presented to the United 
Nations in October. The exiled president has added that if the 
military gives up power on the morning [of any given day], he 
will appoint a prime minister that very afternoon. [passage

  [Excerpts] A coalition of political parties has demanded 
the formation of an ad hoc government as a way out of the 
crisis. This coalition, regrouping MDN [Mobilization For 
National Development], FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and 
Progress], CARENA [Action Committee for National 
Reconciliation], and CCGN [Group of Citizens of the Greater 
North] chose the seventh anniversary of the Constitution to 
submit its resolution bill for parliamentary approval. It should 
also be pointed out that the Chamber of Deputies vice president 
presented his reflections on the 1987 Constitution to the press. 
Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] On Constitution Day, very few 
legislators responded to the invitation from the office of the 
Chamber of Deputies. The parliament's commemoration of the 
seventh anniversary of our fundamental charter could have been 
as dull as the rest of the country's except for this reflection 
by Vice President Mac-Ferl Morquette on the importance of the 
Constitution. Today more than ever, the Constitution remains the 
only compass for legislators in conducting state affairs, said 
the PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of 
Haiti] deputy. Mac-Ferl Morquette explains that despite the 
jolts of national political life, this Constitution, guardian of 
our republican institutions, was able to stand the test of time. 
  Reflecting on the concept of democracy, the vice president 
of 
the lower chamber recalled the ambiguous attitude of those 
elected on 16 December in the face of the Constitution's 
provisions. At the same time, he denounced the totalitarianist 
tradition, which had always characterized the practice of power 
in Haiti. Lack of tolerance and resistance to consensus are the 
main causes for our misfortunes, deplored Vice President 
Mac-Ferl Morquette. [passage omitted]. 
  The political opponents of President Aristide chose 
precisely 
this 29 March to defend their political interests and draw the 
sheets to their side of the bed, launching a new initiative in 
their search for power. Indeed, in a joint resolution, CCGN, 
CARENA, FRAPH, MDN, and the Coordination Committee for National 
Mobilization invited senators and deputies to acknowledge the 
deliberate refusal of the president of the Republic to fill the 
presidential vacuum by applying Article 149 of the Constitution, 
creating a provisional ad hoc government within three days of 
the official presentation of this resolution on 29 March. Let us 
listen, successively, to statements by Hubert DeRonceray of MDN, 
Herve Leveille from CCGN, and Rony Durand from CARENA. 
  [DeRonceray] "This resolution represents the united front we 
created so the political crisis could find national support. 
There are two important points in this resolution: First, we are 
asking the Chamber to take a stand on Article 149 of the 
Constitution in facilitating the formation of a provisional ad 
hoc government. We are saying that in case the Chamber does not 
take action concerning that point, there will be a national 
mobilization. Popular power will take on its responsibility to 
install an ad hoc government. 
  [Leveille] ``I believe all Haitians will agree to find a 
national solution to this crisis. 
  [Unidentified reporter] ``What kind of reaction did you get 
from the president of the lower chamber? 
  [Leveille] ``The president is very concerned about the 
resolution. He promised to begin working on it this afternoon 
with the other presidents within the chamber.'' 
  [Durand] [Words indistinct] mostly autonomy that we are 
making some proposals. That is how to understand it. The 
international community has its position. The national community 
has its own proposal. 
  [Jean] It should be noted that in case it is not carried out 
by the deadline set by these political groups, they say the 
nation will fill the institutional vacuum by an act of public 
power and take measures to establish an ad hoc government. Its 
message is clear: We will move to option zero, the clean sweep.

  [Text] According to Leogane Deputy Gerard Evanns, who spoke 
in favor of amending the 1987 Constitution, before returning to 
constitutional normalcy, the political crisis must be resolved. 
Beaubrun said: Bayonets lay down the law, which is what we are 
experiencing today. He denounces the behavior of everyone 
involved in the current crisis: 
  [Begin Deaubrun recording, in Creole] First of all, to 
return 
to a constitutional framework, we should first [last word in 
English] resolve the Haitian crisis. Nothing can be accomplished 
in a crisis situation. In a crisis situation, it is normal for 
bayonets to lay down the law, while the Constitution goes 
unheeded [bayonet se fe; konstitisyon se papye]. When we say 
bayonets lay down the law, we see bayonets in the hands of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide and the international community when it 
uses embargo, when it uses blockade, when it uses pressure, and 
when it uses threats. All these things are bayonets. We also see 
bayonets in the hands of the Haitian Army when it represses... 
[pauses] I will not say repress because the word repress is not 
appropriate, when the Haitian Army oppresses, when it randomly 
destroys, arresting people arbitrarily, abnormally, 
anarchically. Then bayonets lay down the law, while the 
Constitution goes unheeded." [end recording] 
  Beaubrun invited the senators to show their patriotism by 
disentangling the crisis. He revealed that the Chamber of 
Deputies would soon be looking into the crisis in the Senate 
because Senator Sansaricq sent a letter to the office of the 
lower chamber mentioning sanctions that are being considered by 
the unofficial office [of the Senate] against the senators who 
are chronically absent.

  [Text] Lima, 30 Mar (EFE) -- The adoption of a single 15 
percent tariff for all its imports, which Peru will propose to 
its Andean Group partners on 4 April, is a precondition for the 
country to once again assume all its obligations within the 
group, some of which Peru relinquished in 1992. 
  On 4 and 5 April, the Andean delegates will hold a 
commission 
meeting in Caracas to debate the Peruvian situation and its 
tariff proposal. The commission is the top Andean Group body. 
  The proposal will be made by Minister of Industry, Tourism, 
Commerce, and Integration Liliana Canale. 
  This situation began in August 1992 when Peru asked its 
Andean partners Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela to 
cancel its obligations regarding the liberalization program and 
the minimum external tariff until 31 December 1993. On that 
date, the deadline for Peru to fully reassume its obligations 
was moved to 30 April 1994. 
  Peru has engaged in commercial deals with its Andean 
partners 
since August 1992 through bilateral agreements, which also will 
expire on 30 April. 
  The Peruvian Government currently is operating with two 
types 
of tariffs, 25 and 15 percent, though the latter is more widely 
used -- it applies to 99.5 percent of Peruvian imports. 
  Peruvian entrepreneurs, who are rather distrustful of the 
tariff issue, demand a return to the Andean Group, but 
respecting the Barahona document in which four tariffs were 
proposed. 
  The tariffs are 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent, but they are not 
being enforced yet because tariffs have not been established yet 
for a group of Andean products. 
  The entrepreneurs claim that setting a single 15 percent 
tariff will harm several enterprises because the importation of 
products for production of goods for Peruvians will pay a 15 
percent tariff, while the other Andean countries will pay only 5 
percent for the same products. 
  In the face of this criticism, the government believes it 
cannot change its policy just to favor some sectors. 
  The Industry Ministry stated that, contrary to what 
industrialists have claimed, the Andean market is not vital to 
Peru because it accounts for only 8.7 percent of Peruvian 
exports, while the European Union (EU) accounts for 30 percent, 
the United States for 20 percent, other Latin American countries 
for 10 percent, and Japan for the same percentage as the entire 
Andean Group. 
  Consequently, the Andean nations will concentrate their 
attention on the Peruvian proposal on 4 April and on the way in 
which the proposal will be considered and processed by Andean 
Group members.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Ernesto Techera] </F>
  [Text] Punta del Este -- The 17th Inter-American Naval 
Conference opened at the San Rafael Hotel on 21 March. 
Attending the meeting are the 18 commanders in chief of 
national navies and a member of the Inter-American Defense Board. 
  At issue are different topics of interests for different 
Navies. The commanders will meet with President Lacalle during 
the week. 
  The agenda includes contributions by each delegation and 
provides for some of the issues to be discussed behind closed 
doors. 
  Vice Admiral James Coates, the Uruguayan Navy commander in 
chief, confirmed that a meeting with the president is scheduled 
for midday on 24 March at the Punta del Este Yacht Club. 
  He said: "The National Navy will present two issues. One 
refers to the inter-American war games, a technical issue of 
minor importance compared to the second issue: the South 
Atlantic Maritime Area. Uruguay for the first time is hosting 
the organization's coordinator." 
  Coates said the organ "is a maritime traffic control 
organization that has existed for many years. Uruguay, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Argentina are members." 
  He said: "The issue is very important, not just for us, but 
for all other Navies as well. It is the only case in the world 
of cooperation between Navies from different countries on such 
an important issue as maritime traffic control. This is a 
military issue which has many implications that go beyond the 
military sphere of influence including ocean contamination, the 
control of oil spills, the control of fishery plundering 
actions, arms contraband, drug trafficking, and similar items. 
All these topics come under the chapter of maritime traffic. 
This is the first time four countries have cooperated on 
something as important." 
  Regarding the commanders' meeting with Lacalle, Coates said: 
"The president has had the courtesy to invite all the 
participants to a luncheon during which we will probably 
exchange ideas on different issues with the representatives of 
the Navies of the Americas."

<F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa with an </F>
unidentified correspondent in Cairo on 26 February--recorded] 
  [Text] [Musa] It is an inexcusable criminal act. It is the 
occupying authority's responsibility to protect the citizens 
under occupation as provided by the Geneva Conventions, 
particularly the Fourth Convention, and international law. 
Consequently its responsibility is clear in this case and 
cannot be shirked. 
  [Correspondent] We have already denounced the incident. Yet, 
considering its gravity, are practical steps being taken? 
  [Musa] Discussions are underway, no, not discussions. 
Contacts and consultations are underway in New York in 
connection with the adoption of a resolution. We believe that 
the UN Security Council should adopt a resolution, not a mere 
statement. Some parties want only a statement. We want the 
Security Council to meet and issue a resolution. The 
instructions that we sent to New York spell this out. This is 
our position and I clarified this to U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher when I telephoned him a short time ago to 
discuss the affair. What is important is that the Security 
Council should adopt a clear resolution on the matter. Second, 
the Palestinian citizens' security must be protected versus this 
criminality, this insanity, that the settlers and extremists 
show in the occupied territories, for example the criminal Kakh 
movement. Protecting the Palestinians is very important; this is 
the number one priority to prevent a recurrence of such 
incidents. The ongoing negotiations are supposed to enable us 
to achieve Palestinian self- determination, establish 
Palestinian autonomy, move from square one to more advanced 
positions, and reach a solution to the Palestinian problem. We 
cannot think that it is a solution to suspend the negotiations. 
We act as if we harm Israel when we do this. No, we must adopt 
such measures that will benefit us, including first protecting 
the Palestinians in the occupied territories and second adopting 
measures that will take us closer to a solution. 
  [Correspondent] Does this incident, or rather catastrophe, 
in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque negatively influence the peace process? 
  [Musa] This incident is undoubtedly bound to influence the 
peace process negatively. Its recurrence might kill the process 
entirely. 
  [Correspondent] Whom has Egypt's contacted so far? 
  [Musa] It has contacted everyone. Yesterday I issued a 
statement and the president telephoned Yasir 'Arafat and 
received a message from Clinton and a telephone call from Rabin. 
Christopher called me on the telephone yesterday and I called 
him today about this issue. In addition, we have contacted our 
delegation to the United Nations in connection with the Security 
Council meeting. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, will this incident make the 
Palestinians demand a review of the status of the settlements in 
Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Musa] The presence of the settlements and settlers in this 
way clearly causes grievous harm. 
  [Correspondent] They are time bombs. 
  [Musa] It is evident that grievous harm is being caused by 
the settlements and settlers to the peace operation and the 
Palestinian citizens' security. Our position remains clear on 
this: The settlement policy is an erroneous one that 
contradicts international law. These settlers, particularly the 
extremists such as the Kakh members, must be first disarmed and 
then prevented from harassing the Palestinians.

Israeli massacre. Reports say that Egypt, the Palestinians, and 
the Israelis are holding exchanges aiming to find an acceptable

  [Text] Cairo, Feb 26 (AFP)--Nearly 10,000 Egyptian 
university students on Saturday denounced "Zionism" and demanded 
revenge for the massacre of 52 Muslim worshipers at a mosque in 
the Israeli- occupied West Bank. 
  The demonstrators, heeding a call by the Muslim 
fundamentalist-dominated student union at Cairo University, 
waved black flags and carried coffins draped in Palestinian 
flags. 
  Leaflets distributed by demonstrators called for "holy war" 
in support of the Palestinians, and said the "Muslim holy places 
in Palestine should be put under the protection of a 
fundamentalist state, such as Jordan." 
  They urged Egypt, the only Arab country to have a peace 
treaty with Israel, to break diplomatic relations with the 
Jewish state. 
  The campus was ringed by security forces to prevent any 
violence directed at the Israeli Embassy, only two kilometers 
(1.2 miles) away. 
  The Israeli Army said a lone settler, Barukh Goldstein, 
carried out the slaughter at the mosque in the West Bank town of 
Hebron Friday.

today continued their protests of the massacre in the Hebron 
Mosque, which left more than 60 Palestinians martyred and 
several others wounded at the hands of the terrorist Israeli 
groups. 
  More than 1,000 students organized a peaceful demonstration 
in which they shouted slogans denouncing the sinful aggression 
against the unarmed citizens and raised anti-Israeli signs. 
  Meanwhile, Cairo University has decided to cancel two Arabic 
musical concerts scheduled for today and to postpone until 3 
March a folk dance show by Rida Group, in solidarity with the 
families of the Palestinian martyrs and as an expression of 
denunciation for this appalling crime. 
  At Al-Azhar University students demonstrated today for half 
an hour while the opening session of an international 
competition on the Koran was held on campus. The students 
shouted slogans hostile to the Israeli practices and denounced 
the attack on worshipers at the Hebron Mosque early Friday. The 
students appealed to Arab and Islamic states to adopt a firm 
stance against the Israeli violations.

Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has condemned the massacre that occurred 
during the dawn prayers yesterday in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron, West Bank. He called for placing the Jerusalem and the 
al-Aqsa Mosque issues on the list of urgent and essential issues 
that require a speedy solution. He appealed to the Islamic 
world, which is passing through one of its worst stages, 
particularly in Afghanistan and Somalia, to close ranks and 
stand up to preserve its standing and prestige. This statement 
was made at a popular rally held in the village of al-Sama'inah 
in Faqus District in al-Sharqiyah Governorate last evening. He 
noted that the goal of his tours of Egyptian governorates is to 
explain the facts to the people and to enlighten them about the 
dangers facing Egypt and threatening its security and stability. 
He noted that Egypt's stability ensures the stability of the 
Arab world, as Egypt is the safeguard of security and peace of 
the Islamic world.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)-- Dr. Mufid Shihab, chairman of 
the People's Assembly's Arab and Foreign Relations and National 
Security Committee, has called an emergency meeting of the 
committee tomorrow, Saturday, to discuss the massacres Israeli 
settlers committed against the Palestinians, how to address the 
issue, and the impact it will have on the regional peace process. 
  In exclusive statements to MENA, Dr. Shihab said the 
massacre 
was criminal and barbaric and should be strongly condemned by 
all peace loving powers. He pointed to the danger of 
maintaining Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, 
adding that Israel should seriously contemplate the removal of 
these settlements from the Palestinian territories if we want 
peace and security to be real and to last. 
  Dr. Shihab held Israel fully responsible for the massacre, 
since the 1949 Geneva agreements give the occupying state the 
authority to run and organize utilities in the occupied 
territories. These agreements hold the occupying state solely 
responsible for protecting the lives and safety of all the 
residents of these territories, he said, adding: Hence, Israel 
has not honored these commitments. 
  He remarked that this calls for serious thinking about 
imposing international protection on the territories and their 
residents. This protection should be approved by the 
international community and the concerned institutions, 
primarily the UN Security Council. He emphasized that this 
international protection should be provided to the Palestinians 
on their lands, since it has been proven that the Israeli army 
and administration are incapable of providing protection to 
them, adding that this is important if we want the peace 
negotiations to continue. 
  Dr. Shihab voiced his support for Palestinian president 
Yasir 
'Arafat's call for a Security Council meeting to discuss this 
issue. He called on the Council to intervene quickly and 
decisively and discuss this incident and its consequences and to 
discuss the setting up of the necessary guarantees to protect 
the security of Palestinian citizens from the violent practices 
of the Israeli settlers and the Israeli forces' lack of 
seriousness in confronting these violent practices. 
  He added that it is painful to see the Israeli forces 
confronting the unarmed demonstrators who wanted to denounce 
this massacre and to see them killing more demonstrators instead 
of seriously acting to stop the Israeli settlers' criminal acts.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Religious, political, and 
intellectual people in Egypt have condemned the heinous massacre 
perpetrated by some Israeli settlers at dawn this morning 
against a group of Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, killing scores of people and injuring hundreds. 
  In statements to MENA, they noted that this barbaric and 
criminal act could hamper international efforts currently being 
made to establish peace between the Israelis and the 
Palestinians. 
  They called on the international community to shoulder its 
full responsibility toward this heinous crime and punish Israel 
for it. They held Israel responsible for the incident for not 
taking the necessary security precautions that could have 
prevented this crime. 
  Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq 
described this incident as ugly, criminal, and painful since the 
perpetrators did not take into consideration the fact that the 
worshipers were standing in the hands of God, performing their 
duties for God at such an early hour of the morning. These evil 
men, who honor no truce or covenant, harvested the worshipers 
with their weapons, killing and injuring those people who were 
in God's hands. 
  He said this incident reveals the bestiality, absence of 
humanity, and deviation from the spirit of religion and emotion 
that watches over people who place themselves in the hands of 
God. 
  He added that this is a grave crime for which Israel should 
be made answerable internationally. The families and guardians 
of the martyrs should take Israel to account. Those involved in 
the peace process should also take this crime into consideration. 
  Dr. Mustafa al-Sa'id, chairman of the People's Assembly's 
Economic Committee, said that this incident confirms that the 
cause of peace has not yet reached the mentality of the ordinary 
Israeli, who still thinks he can continue his occupation of 
territory and evacuating its inhabitants through violence and 
terrorism which are practiced against the Arabs in the occupied 
territories. He added that this was the policy pursued by the 
Israelis during the first stages of establishing the so-called 
State of Israel. 
  He noted that such an incident underlines the need for the 
Arab nation to be aware of what is happening in the region now 
and to take whatever step is necessary to make Israel understand 
that these criminal and terrorist actions impede the peace 
efforts that the Israelis claim to welcome. 
  He said that this painful incident is no less grave than the 
Serbs' crimes against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He 
deeply regretted Western society's silence over the repeated 
violations of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the 
occupied Arab territories. 
  Kahlid Muhyi-al-Din, National Progressive Unionist Grouping 
Party leader, described the crime as an ugly one and asked why 
people who were kneeling in prayer and not doing anything to 
harm Israeli settlers were shot at. He said that this incident 
shows that keeping the Israeli settlements in the occupied 
territories threatens the process to establish peace and 
destroys any attempt to establish any peaceful coexistence. 
  Liberals Party leader Mustafa Kamil Murad stressed that this 
incident indicates the increase in the number of extremist 
Israeli elements whose extremism reaches the level of 
criminality, bloodshed, and the violation of God's houses. He 
said that shooting at people in prayer is unprecedented anywhere 
except in Israel. He noted that this incident will have bad 
consequences on the progress of the peace negotiations between 
Israel and the PLO. He called for an international 
investigation into this incident, condemnation of it, and 
international punishment for it. 
  The Wafd Party Secretary Yasin Siraj al-Din said that this 
incident confirms the barbarism of the Israelis and their 
ability to challenge the world public. He noted that the 
incident is aimed against all heavenly principles, including 
Islam and Christianity. He said that the incident is bound to 
impede all the current efforts to establish peace in the region 
in general and the Gaza-Jericho Accord between Israel and the 
PLO in particular. He called for halting all cooperation or 
normalization between the Arabs and Israelis. 
  Siraj al-Din stressed the need to convene an emergency Arab 
summit to be attended by kings and presidents to put an end to 
these repeated criminal Israeli practices. He said if this is 
unachievable, the summit must be held at the level of heads of 
government to end such criminal acts effectively. 
  Ahmad Hamrush, chairman of the Egyptian Afro-Asian 
Solidarity 
Committee, said that this massacre is added to the list of 
massacres committed by the Israeli extremists, starting with the 
massacre in Dayr Yasin in 1947, and including the Sabra and 
Shatila [in Beirut] massacres, and now the Hebron massacre. 
Today's massacre comes at a delicate time when the Israeli and 
Palestinian peoples are joining efforts to achieve peace in the 
region. 
  Hamrush stressed that these extremist terrorist elements 
that 
perpetrated this bestial massacre aim to halt the peace process, 
to incite hatred between the Arabs and Jews, and to continue the 
tension and wars that have engulfed the region for 50 years. He 
said Rabin should be held responsible for this massacre, as he 
continues to procrastinate in the implementation of the 
agreements reached between the Israeli Government and the PLO. 
  Continuing his statement, Hamrush said: I hope this incident 
would not thwart the peaceful settlement and that we will not 
give the Israeli extremists and terrorists the chance to have 
the final word concerning the nations' fate. He added: We are 
passing through a stage that requires self-restraint and 
recourse to logic and rationalism to confront this tragedy so 
that we can avert its consequences and continue the peace 
process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Cairo dailies in their 26 
February editions highlight the horrendous crime a Jewish 
settler committed in the city of Hebron in the occupied West 
Bank. The dailies dedicate their front page headlines to reports 
on the tragedy. 
  Draped in black, AKHBAR AL-YAWM's headline says "Massacre in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque." 
  In its commentary, the paper says that the goal of the 
Israeli extremists was to deal a fatal blow to peace. It adds 
that this massacre should not pass unnoticed; we should pause 
long over it to ask Israel and the world many questions that 
need answering: What is meant by preserving security in the 
Middle East region? Is it Israel's security alone? Where is 
the Palestinians' security? And is it reasonable to leave the 
destiny of the honorable Jerusalem in the hands of Israeli 
extremists who determine who enters it and who gets out, who 
lives and who dies? 
  AKHBAR AL-YAWM says that every Muslim and Christian in the 
world must strongly condemn this barbaric crime. The world 
should not content itself with condemnations; it should seek 
ways to return holy places to their owners instead of leaving 
them in the hands of those who cannot protect them and who let 
armed extremists and crazy persons kill innocent people at dawn, 
AKHBAR AL-YAWM says. 
  In its editorial, AL-AHRAM says this dreadful massacre is, 
first and foremost, the responsibility of the Israeli 
Government. It is not possible to claim that a crazy settler 
committed it of his own accord. 
  The paper notes that there are precedents that fall into the 
same category. Israel claimed that the person who set fire to 
the al- Aqsa Mosque before was mentally unstable, AL-AHRAM says, 
adding that a number of Palestinian laborers working in Israel 
were killed a few years back and the Israeli authorities claimed 
that the murderer was mentally unstable. 
  The paper asks if Palestinian blood has become so cheap that 
dozens of fasting Palestinians should be killed as they 
performed dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. Is it reasonable 
that the Israeli Government's only reaction should be just a 
statement appealing to Palestinians not to take revenge, the 
paper asks. 
  AL-AHRAM affirms that Egypt will take a clear-cut stand when 
the UN Security Council considers this barbaric aggression. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH's main headline says "The Martyrdom of 61 
Palestinians in the Ibrahimi Mosque." 
  The paper highlights Egypt's condemnation of this heinous 
massacre and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's call for an 
emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to take the proper 
measures to protect the Palestinian people. 
  In its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH writes that this massacre 
will burden the international community with the big 
responsibility of insuring security for the Palestinian people, 
who suffer daily as a result of the Israeli occupation practices. 
  The paper adds that this massacre once again emphasizes the 
need to use fair logic, observe human rights, and implement the 
international resolutions that call for Israel's withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories and for protecting the 
Palestinians' right to confront the unheeding, continuous 
Israeli oppression that goes on with the support and 
encouragement of the United States, which is keen to supply the 
Israeli Army with the most sophisticated weapons.

  [Text] On the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, the 
newspaper AL-AHRAM writes in its editorial: The final round of 
these talks ended last Wednesday, having made important progress 
regarding formulating the final agreement. All indications 
showed that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho was to 
begin on the date which the two sides had agreed on. This 
deadline was set for 13 April. 
  However, everything changed suddenly after the horrific 
Hebron massacre. The venue of the negotiations stopped being of 
any consequence, be it Washington, Cairo, or Taba where Egypt 
was providing all possible support for the progress of the 
talks. What is important now is that the talks must focus on 
providing international protection for the Palestinian people 
and on taking the necessary measures to guarantee that the 
Israeli aggressors do not attack the peace-loving Palestinian 
people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad al-Qasir: "How Long Will the World </F>
Remain a Spectator Vis-a-Vis the Palestinian People?"] 
  [Text] How long will the world community silently watch the 
Palestinian people being exterminated, not only in the streets 
and the refugee camps but also inside the mosques in an 
unprecedented brutal way? 
  Where are the international human rights organizations whose 
task is to protect people everywhere? 
  When will the world act to protect the Palestinians inside 
the occupied territories? 
  What is the fate of the Middle East peace process? 
  Many questions rise in the minds of observers and political 
analysts everywhere in the wake of the ugly massacre perpetrated 
by a Jewish settler inside the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on the 
West Bank at dawn yesterday. The massacre has dismayed Muslims 
everywhere and reminded them of the burning of the al-Aqsa 
Mosque. It has dismayed the whole world with them. Peace loving 
forces in Israel have strongly condemned the act. 
  We believe that this massacre is not part of the daily, 
mutual Palestinian Israeli violence and killings but a 
premeditated crime with serious implications, not merely because 
of its hideousness, the method in which it was carried out at 
this particular time, and the number of martyrs and wounded who 
fell in it, but because it raises numerous doubts about the 
Israeli authorities' ability to provide security for the 
Palestinian people, whose land is under occupation. At the same 
time, the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been 
stumbling for months as a result of Israeli security claims. 
  Egypt strongly condemns this criminal action and urges the 
world community to act promptly to protect the Palestinian 
people as Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa demanded yesterday. 
  We also believe that this hideous massacre raises several 
important points. First, any discussion of security 
requirements in the framework of the current Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations must focus primarily on providing security not for 
the Israelis, as the Israeli delegation is demanding, but for 
the Palestinians. The danger threatens only the unarmed 
Palestinians who demand to live free on their national soil like 
all other nations. Thus Israel's security pretext totally 
collapses. 
  Second, keeping the settlements inside the Palestinian 
territories is an issue that comes forcefully to the fore in the 
negotiations and requires a decisive solution. Peace will not 
come as long as the settlements stay and as long as their 
residents carry weapons with permission from the authorities and 
fire indiscriminately and with impunity on civilian women, 
children, and old people, perpetrating ugly massacres against 
them as happened at dawn yesterday while worshipers were praying 
in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Third, this terrible crime has proven the need to expedite 
the peace moves, particularly on the Palestinian-Israeli track, 
on the grounds that the Palestinian issue is at the core of the 
Middle East conflict. The Declaration of Principles, the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement, and the Cairo Agreement must be 
implemented so that the Israeli Government can demonstrate its 
sincere intentions to establish a just peace that will serve the 
good of all the nations in the Arab region. We believe that it 
is now Israel's responsibility to carry this out because the PLO 
has shown the utmost flexibility for the sake of peace. 
  Fourth, any Israeli delay or procrastination is bound to 
encourage extremists on both sides to carry out lethal strikes 
with the aim of burying the peace. Delay will open the door 
wide for mutual violence. On the same note, the Jewish settlers 
and the Israeli forces must be banned from opening fire in such 
an insane manner on an unarmed population whose land was 
occupied by force. 
  Fifth, this criminal incident lays a great and direct 
responsibility on the shoulders of the two peace sponsors, 
particularly U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Europe, whose 
peace is intimately linked with the Middle East's security and 
peace. Their reactions must not be limited to denunciations and 
expressions of sorrow. The Palestinian people, and all the 
world's free peoples, are waiting for a positive reaction. Nor 
is Sarajevo's incident far from the mind. 
  Any delay on the part of the Israeli Government to adopt 
deterrent measures against the perpetrators of the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, any failure to halt the Jewish settlers' 
criminal actions, and a slow reaction by the world community to 
protect the Palestinians will have serious negative 
repercussions, not only for the peace process but for the 
security of the Israeli people themselves. It is time the 
Israelis learned that a just peace is the only way to ensure 
their security and protection.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zayn al-Ja'fari: "Egypt Strongly Denounces </F>
the Israeli Massacre of Palestinians"] 
  [Text] The massacre by Israeli settlers of Palestinians 
attending the dawn prayers at the Ibrahimi mosque in holy 
Jerusalem [placename as heard], with a death toll of 53, sounded 
a sinister alarm. The massacre may harm the Palestinian Israeli 
peace talks. It illustrates the need to place the status of holy 
Jerusalem on the agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli talks. 
  The horrendous slaughter of Palestinian worshippers led the 
Israelis to seal off the West Bank and Gaza and sent angry 
Palestinians marching into the streets. Ironically, more 
Palestinians were shot and killed by the Israeli army trying to 
quell Palestinian demonstrations. 
  The shocking incident in which hundreds of worshipers were 
injured brought a cascade of protests from international 
circles, with many observers expressing fears that the 
slaughter, and the resulting anger among the Palestinians, would 
undercut peace efforts in the region. The Israeli Government 
ought to take all the blame for the attack on Palestinian 
worshippers in the Ibrahimi mosque. 
  Egypt, a country that has a historic role in the region and 
that has been actively involved in the peace process, has 
strongly denounced the massacre in Hebron on the West Bank. 
  Commenting on the atrocity, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
stressed the need to combat terrorism, a scourge that has spread 
in numerous societies of variant religions and political 
doctrines. Musa said the massacre underscores the need to 
safeguard Palestinian, not just Israeli, security. Security 
claims, he said, are not the exclusive prerogative of Israel. 
Musa said that in view of the incident's ugliness and its grave 
implications for the peace process in the Middle East, Egypt 
will take part in any UN Security Council meeting convened at 
the request of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat has 
called for immediate international action to protect the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  It seems that the urgency of the Palestinian, Arab, and 
international reaction has alerted the Israeli Government to the 
hideousness of the carnage. A senior Israeli official made a 
statement saying that the Israeli settlers would be wrong to 
think that such acts could obstruct the peace talks. Indeed, he 
said, the Israeli Government has no option but to accelerate the 
peace process, even if this involves further concessions to the 
Palestinian side. 
  The incident demonstrates the drawbacks of Israel's policy 
on 
settlements. The incident should make Israel carefully consider 
removing the Israeli settlements from the Palestinian 
territories so that the peace process might remain on the right 
track. 
  What particularly distressed the international community is 
that such atrocities inflicted by the Israelis on the 
Palestinians may lead sections of the Palestinian community to 
lose interest in talks with the Israelis under the current 
conditions, that is, as long as Israeli settlements and settlers 
are part of the deal. 
  To conclude, let us state that Egypt, eager to maintain the 
peace momentum in the region, is holding intensive contacts with 
various sides to preserve a climate conducive to talks and 
eventually to peace in the region.

  [Text] Kuwait, 25 Feb (KUNA) -- Kuwait tonight denounced 
the hideous slaughter perpetrated by the Zionists in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in occupied Hebron which led to the falling 
of scores of Palestinian martyrs and more than 200 injured. 
  A spokesman for the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry told KUNA that 
this horrendous crime had moved the human feelings and 
conscience in Kuwait by its hideous and savage nature, and that 
denunciation is not enough to condemn this deliberate slaughter. 
He said that the Security Council and the superpowers in it are 
required more than ever before to take decisive and firm 
measures to protect the Palestinian people against such 
concocted crimes. 
  He added that by its protection of the settlements in the 
heart of the occupied Arab areas, the Israeli Government bears 
legal, material, and moral responsibility for this massacre. He 
said that while offering its sincerest condolences to the 
relatives of the martyrs and the Palestinian people, Kuwait 
believes that more international efforts should be made to 
secure the full Palestinian rights for setting up their own 
state on their national territory, because this is the sure 
guarantee for a safe future for them.

  [Text] Riyadh, 25 Feb -- The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has 
condemned the massacre perpetrated at dawn today by Israeli 
settlers against Palestinians who were praying in the mosque of 
Abraham in Hebron. This massacre resulted in the deaths of 
dozens of people and the wounding of hundreds. 
  In a statement today to SPA, a responsible source expressed 
his condemnation and censure of this regrettable event, which 
bore the marks of extremism, fanaticism, and lack of respect for 
human rights on the part of the Israelis. 
  The source laid responsibility for this massacre on the 
Israeli Government because of its disregard for the crimes 
committed by Israeli settlers against unarmed Palestinians. He 
called on the international community to face up to its 
responsibility of providing protection for the Palestinians, who 
are suffering under the Israeli occupation, and of stopping 
these serious crimes and massacres against them. 
  In conclusion the statement indicates that this abominable 
crime might have a negative effect on the peace process in the 
Middle East.

  [Text] Riyadh, Feb 26, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers deplored 
today the massacre of Palestinian worshippers at Ibrahim mosque 
yesterday. 
  Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the massacre was a result of 
the 
continuation of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. 
  The paper said the crime has provided a clear evidence that 
the proposed peace initiatives will never be realized. 
  It would be better for those who raise their voices speaking 
about human rights to get acquainted of the fact that no 
peaceful settlement will never [as received] be realized without 
putting an end to the Jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories and departure of the Jewish settlers. 
  'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the massacre 
at Ibrahim mosque has reflected the criminal plots hatched by 
the Zionist quarters against the Palestinians. 
  It is not a mere crime committed by one person as the 
Israeli 
authorities have been alleging, but is a well-arranged crime 
prepared by a number of culprits, said the daily. 
  By alleging that the criminal committed suicide Israel is 
trying to distract attention from the vicious bloody crime, said 
the daily. 
  The daily held Israel responsibile of all massacres 
committed 
in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  It also condemned shooting of the Palestinians who gathered 
at the hospital to donate with their blood to the injured people 
as well as shooting of the Palestinian demonstrators who shouted 
to express their anger over the bloody incident. 
  This massacre was not the first of its kind and will never 
be 
the final one, said the daily. 
  For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH said overlooking of 
such 
crime will never be tolerated or accepted. 
  The Israeli authorities should be held responsibile for the 
massacre of the worshippers at Ibrahim mosque yesterday, said 
the daily. 
  The paper criticized the Western information media which 
used 
to justify the Israeli acts against the Palestinians and the 
Arabs. 
  When the Zionists commit crimes voices are always raised 
calling for self-restraint and rationalization, added the daily.

  [Text] Abu Dhabi, 25 Feb (WAKH) -- The United Arab Emirates 
has strongly condemned the heinous, ugly crime perpetrated by 
the Zionist settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn 
today. 
  A responsible source at the UAE Foreign Ministry held Israel 
fully responsible for this massacre because it has continued to 
arm them and overlook their repeated crimes and attacks on the 
defenseless Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. 
  In a statement disseminated by the EMIRATES NEWS AGENCY, the 
source said this massacre, which took place under the eyes of 
the Israeli occupation forces, proves beyond doubt the Israeli 
Government's collusion with the criminals. 
  The source called on the international community, headed by 
the Security Council and the big powers supporting the peace 
process, to undertake a serious and effective move that goes 
beyond condemnation and denunciation and to adopt tangible, 
decisive, and practical steps to protect the Palestinian city 
[as received].

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry and official and unofficial 
circles in Yemen have received with intense pain and indignation 
the news of the egregious crime perpetrated this morning by a 
member of the Zionist gangs in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
against innocent worshippers, of whom over 60 were killed and 
300 wounded. 
  The Foreign Ministry appeals to the international community 
to act to halt such terrorist acts, and condemns the Zionist 
authorities for obstructing the transfer of the wounded to 
hosptials. The Foreign Ministry calls on the community of 
nations to press for bringing pressure to bear in the interest 
of Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] Hebron, Occupied West Bank, Feb 25 (AFP) -- 
Fifty-two Palestinians were slain and dozens wounded at a Hebron 
mosque Friday while another nine Palestinians were shot dead in 
ensuing clashes, doctors told AFP. 
  In the aftermath of the firing by one or more settlers at 
the 
Tomb of the Patriarchs, Israeli troops shot dead three 
Palestinians in Hebron, three in the Gaza Strip, one in Nablus, 
one in Jerusalem and a settler killed another man in the 
Bethlehem area, Palestinian sources said. 
  Police said a Palestinian hacked to death an 80-year-old 
Israeli with an axe near Tel Aviv and made off with his gun. 
  Maurice Eisenstadt was patrolling the streets of Kfar Saba 
as 
a volunteer in the civil guard. Several Palestinians in the 
vicinity were arrested. 
  Doctors in Hebron and Jerusalem hospitals reported 113 
people 
treated for bullet wounds, most of them hurt in the mosque 
carnage. The killer either turned his automatic rifle on himself 
or was shot by someone else, the army said. 
  About 100 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in 
the Gaza Strip, about a dozen them seriously, as trouble erupted 
throughout the occupied territories. 
  In the Old City of Jerusalem hundreds of Palestinians staged 
running battles with police and soldiers. Palestinian sources 
said 47 were injured, most by rubber bullets or tear gas 
inhalation. 
  Police said 13 members of the security forces were hurt by 
the showers of rocks which rained down on them from the walls 
and Temple Mount after some 80,000 Moslems attended prayers at 
Al Aqsa mosque.

  [Text] According to unofficial figures 39 people were 
killed in the Cave of the Patriarchs yesterday. Fifteen 
residents were killed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in 
Hebron and its environs during the riots which erupted following 
the massacre. Another four were killed in similar circumstances 
-- three in Gaza and one in Nabulus. 
  IDF spokesmen say they do not have accurate figures 
regarding 
the number of casualties in Hebron, adding that the issue is 
still being examined. 
  The number of wounded rose yesterday to more than 250 
people. 
Approximately 100 cartridge cases fired by Barukh Goldstein were 
found in the Cave of the Patriarchs' Yitzhaq Hall. 
  The security forces are preventing Qiryat Arba' residents 
from entering Hebron. They can reach Jerusalem only in military 
escorted convoys going through Bet Shemesh. Our correspondent 
Mira Amsalem reports from Hebron that car traffic in Qiryat 
Arba' is extremely limited.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent in the territories Moti Amir -- </F>
live] 
  [Excerpt] The unrest in the territories continues, 
although the scope of the riots does not match the incidents 
yesterday following the Hebron massacre. In Gaza, a youth was 
killed a short while ago by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers' fire during severe clashes with the security forces. 
Early this morning, a curfew was clamped on the al-Shaykh 
Radwan and al-Shaja'iyah neighborhoods of Gaza, where the most 
extensive riots took place yesterday. Curfews were also imposed 
on the refugee camps of Jabalyah, al-Shati', al-Nusayrat, and 
Dayr al-Balah. 
  IDF patrols came under fire four times in Dayr al-Balah last 
night, and miraculously no one was hurt. There were no other 
shooting incidents in the Gaza Strip, and last night was quite 
quiet there. 
  In Judaea and Samaria, incidents started early this morning, 
mostly stone-throwing. According to the reports, stones were 
thrown at cars on the Bet Horon-Ben Shemen road, and four 
Israelis, including a baby, were injured by stones and glass 
debris. Two of the wounded were taken to the Hadassah Hospital, 
and another two were treated by medical teams on the site and 
refused to go to hospital. 
  Riots took place in the village of Yattah, south of Hebron. 
One person was seriously injured in the head in clashes there 
with the soldiers, and was taken to al-Maqasid Hospital in East 
Jerusalem. 
  Just now we are receiving additional reports from the field: 
In the Tulkarm refugee camp another youth was killed and six 
people were injured by IDF soldiers' fire. Four additional 
Palestinians were injured in the Qabatiyah refugee camp, near 
Janin. These last reports have not yet been confirmed by the 
security forces. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Tempers have somewhat calmed down in Yafo, but 
hundreds of Arab residents are still clustered on Yefet Street. 
In the riot in the street this afternoon five people were 
slightly wounded by stones, among them policemen, an IDF Radio 
correspondent and an Israel television worker. Our 
correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i reports that hundreds of raging 
rioters threw stones, attacked policemen and passersby, called 
for avenging the Hebron massacre, and chanted anti-Israeli 
slogans. One shop was torched and several other shops on Yefet 
Street were damaged. Tires and garbage canisters were set 
ablaze and windows of several vehicles were smashed. The police 
used tear gas and repulsed the rioters from the street. Arab 
dignitaries from Yafo, Tel Aviv municipality representatives, 
and Police commanders are trying to calm tempers. Police 
Commissioner Rafi Peled is also at the site. [passage omitted] 
  A youth was killed by Border Police gunfire in the village 
of 
'Isawiyah north of Jerusalem. Our police affairs correspondent 
Aviv Bushinsky reports a border police unit was stoned and 
several policemen were wounded. The force used tear gas to 
disperse the rioters. One of the youths took a gas grenade and 
hurled it at the policemen. One of the policemen, who thought 
the youth was handling a hand grenade, shot the youth and killed 
him. The youth was taken for burial, and a riot erupted in the 
place. 
  A tourist was slightly wounded by shots fired by a Jew from 
the settlement of Betar in Hagay Street in East Jerusalem. Our 
police affairs correspondent reports the man, who was apparently 
drunk, said he fired the shots after he spotted terrorists. The 
man was detained for interrogation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Two Israelis were wounded by IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] gunfire a short while ago near the village of 'Anabta in 
the Nabulus area. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that 
initial reports indicate that IDF soldiers shot at an Israeli 
truck which drove through the roadblock they were manning. The 
truck's two passengers were wounded. One of the passengers was 
seriously wounded while the second man sustained light to 
moderate injuries. After being treated at the scene by IDF 
medical teams they were rushed to the hospital. 
  The riots in the Bedouin town of Rahat in southern Israel 
are 
growing worse. A short while ago, the rioters hurled firebombs 
at policemen and at the Center for Bedouin Heritage. Our 
correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the police commissioner 
is currently meeting with local notables in an attempt to defuse 
tensions but apparently no agreement has been reached on a 
reduction of police forces and the evacuation of the police 
station. The roads leading to the eastern entrances to 
Beersheba are still closed because of rioting and stone throwing 
incidents. 
  Following consultations with the police commissioner, Roni 
Milo, the mayor of Tel Aviv and Yafo, this evening announced 
that all the women and the youths arrested in the course of the 
past two days of rioting in Yafo would be released this evening. 
The mayor promised that if things remained quiet, the rest of 
the detainees would be released. Our correspondent Dani 
Gur-Arye reports that the mayor was speaking at a mourning 
ceremony at the Muslim Club in Yafo. At the ceremony, many 
people complained that the police had employed excessive 
violence. Councilman Khalid Habub asserted that the Arab 
residents of Yafo would accede to the mayor's request to show 
restraint if all the detainees were released. 
  A firebomb was hurled tonight on Me'ir Naqar Street, in 
Jerusalem's Armon Hanetziv neighborhood. No one was hurt and no 
damage was caused. A child was lightly injured by glass shards 
on Hizma junction, near Pisgat Ze'ev on the outskirts of 
Jerusalem, when youths hurled rocks at a No. 25 bus. 
  In al-Tira, the police arrested eight youths this evening. 
They are suspected of throwing stones at police patrol cars and 
setting tires on fire. Our correspondent Yafa Glick reports 
that a total of 38 youths from al-Tayyibah, Kafr Qasim, and 
al-Tirah were arrested this evening by the Sharon District 
police.

  [Text] The police has released 47 of the rioters arrested 
in Yafo. Twenty people remain under arrest. Chief 
Superintendent Ya'aqov Peretz, the commander of the Yafo police, 
told our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i that if quiet was 
maintained, all the detainees would be released. 
  Clashes are currently taking place in the center of Nazareth 
between the police and local residents. The police were pelted 
with rocks and are now using clubs to disperse the rioters. The 
municipality's attempts to calm the atmosphere proved 
unsuccessful. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that in the 
village of Mashhad, near Nazareth, an army vehicle was torched 
and its windows were smashed. There were no casualties. The 
police is stopping Egged buses from travelling through large 
Arab towns in northern Israel to ward off any clashes with Arab 
residents. 
  Our correspondent Yafa Glick reports that this morning, 
dozens of youths barricaded the entrance to Kafr Qasim. They 
fired slingshots at the police but missed. 
  Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that the funeral 
procession of the Rahat resident killed yesterday has left his 
home and is now traveling on the Bet Qama-Mishmar Hanegev road, 
which has been closed to traffic. Thousands of people are 
attending the funeral and the atmosphere is tense. 
  Curfews remain in force in most of the Arab towns and 
refugee 
camps in the Gaza Strip. This is also the case in all the large 
towns in Judaea and Samaria and the adjacent refugee camps. 
Approximately 1.25 million people in the territories are under 
curfew. 
  The delegation of Palestinian notables from East Jerusalem 
which set out on a condolence visit to Hebron has decided to 
return to Jerusalem after the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
stopped it from reaching its destination. Our correspondent 
Moti Amir reports that the convoy was detained at an IDF 
roadblock near the al-'Arrub refugee camp and only four 
notables, including Faysal al-Husayni, were permitted to enter 
Hebron. In reaction, all the Palestinian notables decided to 
return to Jerusalem. Faysal al-Husayni told Qol Yisra'el that 
the Army had not changed its ways despite the fact that the 
Civil Administration was in favor of the delegation's condolence 
visit to Hebron. 
  At an IDF roadblock in the 'Etzyon Bloc, the family of a 
Palestinian killed in the Hebron massacre is being prevented 
from returning to their home in town. The five family members 
returned from visiting their wounded son, also injured in the 
Hebron attack, who is hospitalized in East Jerusalem. The 
family presented their Hebron identity cards but the soldiers at 
the roadblock are not allowing them to return home.

  [Text] The special cabinet meeting ended in Tel Aviv a 
short while ago. The ministers raised proposals for the prime 
minister's attention and consideration. These proposals will be 
worked out by the prime minister and then raised for discussion 
at the cabinet meeting on 27 February. One proposal was to 
remove dangerous residents if there is evidence that they are 
Kakh members. Another was to pay compensation to the casualties. 
A third proposal was to establish a national inquiry commission. 
  Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer told our correspondent 
Karmela 
Menashe that the government is determined to accelerate the 
peace process. Minister Amnon Rubinstein noted that for the 
first time, a closure was imposed also on Jewish residents in 
Hebron and Qiryat Arba' and that they cannot move without 
permission. 
  At the end of the meeting, Police Minister Moshe Shahal said 
that the police are currently operating in 12-hour shifts. 
Units were reinforced in all sensitive places, particularly in 
Jerusalem. The police minister added that the attorney general 
raised several proposals during the meeting, including removing 
Jewish residents from their homes, a move which according to the 
attorney general, has a legal basis. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports the closure was expanded 
to encompass the whole of Judaea and Samaria, and to close down 
the Cave of the Patriarchs for 48 hours. The closure on the 
Gaza Strip, imposed this morning, as well the curfew imposed on 
Hebron and Bethlehem following the murder, are continuing.

<F P=106> [Government announcement following the cabinet meeting </F>
outside the prime minister's bureau at the government and Army 
compound in Tel Aviv on 25 February; read by Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal in Hebrew -- recorded] 
  [Text] The government's decision following today's debate, 
a decision which the prime minister asked me and Minister Sarid 
to formulate, is as follows: 
  In its meeting today the cabinet expressed deep shock over 
the despicable murder of innocent Palestinians who were saying 
prayers, during the Ramadan fast, at the Cave of the Patriarchs, 
a place sacred to the two faiths. The government is sending its 
condolences to the families of the dead and is wishing speedy 
recovery to the wounded. The government has decided to 
compensate the families of the victims. The government is 
calling on all residents, both Arabs and Jews, to exercise 
maximum restraint despite the grave circumstances. The IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and all the security forces are adopting 
all necessary measures to prevent incitement, violence, and a 
deterioration of the situation. During the meeting, the cabinet 
ministers and the attorney general raised proposals for various 
possible measures of handling radical Israeli elements that are 
instigative elements in the territories. The government believes 
that these elements gravely and dangerously violate public 
order, and that every legal measure should be adopted to curb 
and restrain them. Even concerning an act by a single 
individual -- as was the case in Hebron this morning -- we 
cannot ignore the influence of instigative remarks made publicly 
that threaten the citizen's well-being. 
  The government has entrusted the prime minister and defense 
minister with the task of examining all measures proposed during 
today's discussion and of informing the cabinet of his decisions 
on 27 February. The investigation of today's incidents will be 
complete. The government is resolved to continue its peace 
efforts and to promote the negotiations to the best of its 
ability.

<F P=106> [Report by Menashe Raz] </F>
  [Text] Just like yesterday's session, tomorrow's cabinet 
session will be held under the grave impression that the Hebron 
massacre might leave an eternal mark on the State of Israel. 
Ministers have compared the dreadful impact of the incident with 
similar incidents in the past, such as the Dayr al-Yasin 
massacre. 
  There will be two main issues on tomorrow's cabinet's 
agenda: 
immediate action to be taken against the hard-core of the 
extreme settlers in Hebron and Qiryat Arba', and finding a 
long-term formula in response to the international pressure 
focused on Israel. In this context, setting up a state 
commission of inquiry to investigate yesterday morning's 
incidents in the Cave of the Patriarchs is under discussion. 
  According to the justice minister and the attorney general, 
these two issues are fully covered by state laws, emergency 
regulations, and legislation applying to the territories. As 
for the immediate moves against what is called the Brooklyn gang 
and its Israeli supporters -- all from the school of Rabbi 
Kahana -- the steps discussed are: distancing them from the 
territories; deporting them; preventing their presence in 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; and applying administrative 
detentions. The authorities will deal with familiar 
individuals, whose names and places of residence are known. 
  All the cabinet ministers agree on those steps, some even 
expect them to be taken within hours. In the session tomorrow, 
they will be briefed about action taken. As for the closure on 
Qiryat Arba', several ministers urged clamping a curfew on 
Qiryat Arba', and not to settle for a closure. Observing 
closure is not very problematic on a Sabbath. The question is 
what will happen at the end of it, this evening and tomorrow 
morning. Most of the ministers made determined and clear 
remarks today on this issues as well. The principle theme is to 
prevent friction between Jews and Arabs in Hebron for fear of 
revenge. 
  Currently, not all the ministers agree on establishing a 
state commission of inquiry. Until this time, and in 
yesterday's cabinet session, the prime minister has not taken a 
stand on this issue. Justice Minister David Liba'i is leading 
the move to set up the inquiry team. It is the duty of the 
Government of Israel to document the massacre at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs; from the historic point of view, there is no other 
way, those favoring the move have said. The government should 
not allow a situation in which such a commission is set up in 
response to public or international pressure. It should be 
initiated by the government. 
  Ministers in opposition to this move have said that Israel 
is 
not concealing the facts. Everything that had happened in 
Hebron was initiated by a single person. Punitive measures 
taken by the security forces, will add to the understanding that 
the State of Israel is handling the Hebron incident without 
hiding anything. 
  There is no intention to disarm the settlers. The ministers 
have rejected this outright. Another issue the government will 
be briefed about is the release of the Palestinian prisoners. 
Jerusalem sources said this morning that this issue has been 
agreed on in talks with the PLO, regardless of the Hebron 
incident. According to the sources, the incident will probably 
speed up the process. 
  [In a recorded passage later in the same newscast, Faysal 
al-Husayni says in English: "If the Israelis are going on 
thinking that in the interim period there will be a possibility 
of leaving the settlers on the ground and keeping their army to 
protect the settlers, as they are saying, it is nonsense."] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 February 
adds: "Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu today warned against 
the government readiness to make far-reaching concessions to the 
Palestinians because it is under pressure." The report adds 
that "Netanyahu stressed that he opposes taking unjustified 
steps against the settlers who constantly suffer from the Arab 
terror."

<F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by Hayim </F>
Hecht following the cabinet session, outside the Prime 
Minister's Office -- live] 
  [Text] [Hecht] The cabinet session has ended, and the 
first bit of news is that the cabinet decided to set up a state 
commission of inquiry. All the resolutions the government made 
today were unanimous. Minister Yosi Sarid is here with us. 
  [Sarid] All the resolutions were unanimous. The first 
decision is to create a state commission of inquiry. Another 
decision passed was to issue restrictive orders against the 
extreme settlers, the men who instigate fighting and strife, 
those who constitute a real danger. Another decision speaks of 
administrative detentions; yet another speaks of the need to 
disarm extremist settlers, mainly in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron. 
Also, the attorney general was ordered to examine the 
possibility of outlawing extremist organizations. It is my 
understanding that he will present his decision in a few days. 
  These are the cabinet resolutions. They are important and 
set a precedent. I believe their gravity matches the grave view 
the government holds of the terrible incident that took place at 
the Cave of Patriarchs on 25 February. 
  [Hecht] When you speak about restrictive orders, we even 
heard of exile orders.... 
  [Sarid, interrupting] Not exile [haglaya] orders; I speak of 
restrictive [hagbala] orders. Exile orders were also examined 
but, for legal reasons, we reached the conclusion that they will 
not be effective enough. 
  [Hecht] What do restrictive orders mean, and to how many 
people will they apply? 
  [Sarid] I do not want to discuss figures because they do not 
matter. What matters is the resolution, the precedent that was 
set. In the initial stage, the figures may be low but, should 
the need arise, they will grow. A restriction means that people 
within the Green Line boundaries will not be able to cross it if 
it is feared that they may constitute a threat. People residing 
beyond the Green Line will not be able to enter sensitive places 
that might turn into centers of riots when such people who act 
madly -- and they are not mad, they only act that way -- arrive 
there. 
  [Hecht] Does this mean that the hard-core Kakh activists and 
supporters will be removed from Hebron and Qiryat Arba'? 
  [Sarid] I cannot speak in generalizations because the 
reference is to specific, individual people. There is no doubt, 
however, that the government today decided to deal with the 
hard-core extremist elements with a very firm hand. 
  [Hecht] What will be the terms of reference for the state 
commission of inquiry that you decided to set up? 
  [Sarid] The precise mandate of the commission will be 
drafted and determined today by three persons: the foreign 
minister, the justice minister, and the education minister. 
  [Hecht] Who will head it? 
  [Sarid] By law, the president of the High Court of Justice, 
and he will determine the composition of the commission, not the 
government. This is one of the advantages of a state commission 
over other investigating teams. 
  [Hecht] You and the other Meretz ministers came here today 
well prepared, with a precise list of measures that should be 
taken against the mad extremists in the Hebron area. Are you 
satisfied that the government accepted your recommendations? 
  [Sarid] We are very pleased. The government did not accept 
our recommendations. I said before the session, and I say now, 
there is nothing special about the Meretz ministers. I am happy 
to say that the vast majority of the ministers share the same 
views. I believe all of them do -- after all, the decisions 
were unanimous. Therefore, I do not believe that Meretz should 
keep itself separate from the other ministers. 
  [Hecht] Did the prime minister brief you about the upcoming 
resumption of the peace talks? Do you, as a senior member of 
the negotiating team, know of it? Did you get any message from 
the PLO? 
  [Sarid] Regrettably, we cannot say that talks are resuming 
at this point. There is no doubt, however, and we believe that 
the resolutions we made today will make it significantly easier 
to resume the negotiations in the coming days.

  [Text] The government has decided to set up a state 
commission of inquiry on the massacre at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs in Hebron. The government has also decided to adopt 
firm measures against Kakh's radical activists. Among other 
things, orders restricting the movement of such activists as 
well as detention orders will be issued, and some of the 
activists will be disarmed. Justice Minister David Liba'i told 
our correspondent Hayim Hecht that the measures are in effect as 
of now, and will be applied according to the discretion of the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] commanders in the area. All the 
government decisions were adopted unanimously. The attorney 
general was asked to check, within a few days, the possibility 
of outlawing radical organizations, specifically Kakh and Kahana 
Hay. Minister Sarid said that the possibility of issuing exile 
orders was examined, but it turned out that they would not be 
sufficiently effective. He hoped that the measures determined 
by the government would lead to the resumption of the political 
process. 
  As for the detention centers, the security forces are 
preparing for the release of 800 to 1,000 security prisoners. 
Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the release of the 
prisoners is in accordance with the government's decision. The 
Cave of the Patriarchs itself will be reopened only after new 
security and prayer arrangements are arranged. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1315 GMT on 27 February 
elaborates on the cabinet decisions, saying that "the foreign 
minister, the justice minister, and Minister Amnon Rubinstein 
were authorized to formulate the powers of the commission of 
inquiry, in consultation with the attorney general and the 
cabinet secretary. The government decides on the establishment 
of the commission, but it is the Supreme Court that appoints its 
members." The decision on the commission was made unanimously, 
after Rabin withdrew his reservations about its establishment, 
accepting Justice Minister Liba'i's position and expressing the 
hope that "the establishment of such a commission would not be a 
precedent for other incidents."] 
  Knesset Member [MK] Binyanmin Netanyahu demands that a state 
commission of inquiry also investigate the responsibility of the 
political echelon for the deterioration in the security 
situation, and not settle for the responsibility of the military 
level only. According to Netanyahu, it should be determined how 
it is possible that 33 Israelis and dozens of Arabs have been 
murdered since the signing of the Oslo accord. This has been 
reported by our correspondent Shmu'el Tal. 
  The appeal submitted to the High Court of Justice on the 
state commission of inquiry was withdrawn. Our correspondent 
Mira Amsalem reports that MK Darawshah and Attorney 'Imad Dakkur 
informed the High Court of Justice that they are withdrawing 
their appeal in the wake of the government's decisions. At the 
same time, the appellants announced they reserve the right to 
appeal to the court again if developments so warrant.

  [Excerpt] A number of Jewish residents of Hebron have been 
detained by security forces overnight. An indefinite closure on 
the entire West Bank and the Gaza Strip went into effect this 
morning. Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders in the territories are 
demanding that the question of Jewish settlements be put at the 
top of the agenda, before peace talks resume. Mark Weiss 
reports: 
  In what appears to be the first stage of the expected crack 
down on the extremist fringe within the settler community, 
security forces detained overnight a number of Jewish residents 
of Hebron. Residents of Qiryat Arba' also reported that soldiers 
came to detain Kakh leaders Barukh Marzel and No'am Federman, 
but the two managed to escape. 
  An indefinite closure went into effect at 0300 this morning 
on the whole of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinians are 
not being allowed to enter Israel until further notice. 
  Shots were fired at an Army patrol north of Bayt Hanun in 
Gaza this morning. An Army jeep was hit, but none of the 
soldiers were injured. The troops returned fire and launched a 
search for the attackers. 
  In a second consecutive day of violence in the territories, 
three Palestinians were killed yesterday and dozens wounded. 
There were also riots throughout Arab areas inside Israel. 
More than 40 people were arrested in Nazareth, and in Yafo 
hundreds of rioters attacked police and damaged Jewish property. 
  The head of Fatah in the West Bank, Faysal al-Husayni, says 
he is recommending to PLO leaders in Tunis to continue the peace 
process, providing that the issue of Jewish settlements is 
placed at the top of the agenda. Al-Husayni said that the 
Hebron massacre has created a new reality, and the Declaration 
of Principles, drawn up in Oslo, is no longer valid. [passage

  [Text] The territories are under full closure since this 
morning and their residents are banned from coming to work in 
Israel until further notice. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that a closure was also 
clamped on Qiryat Arba'. In practice, however, it is not being 
observed and every two hours a convoy of cars and a bus to 
Jerusalem leaves Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. The convoys are 
escorted by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops due to 
stone-throwing incidents in the area of Halhul. 
  In several Israeli Arab settlements where the Islamic 
Movement is in power, a general strike is still observed today 
and will continue tomorrow. Our correspondent Yo'el Dar reports 
that Police Minister Moshe Shahal has promised Knesset Member 
Tawfiq Zayyad that all the Israeli Arabs detained in riots 
yesterday will be released today. Some 23 of the youths detained 
yesterday in riots in al-Tayyibah and al-Tirah were released 
this morning. Only two youths suspected of throwing stones were 
remanded in custody. 
  Riots continue this morning in Bedouin settlements in the 
Negev. Youths are hurling stones at passing cars, and a 
policeman was slightly injured by a stone. An Egged Company bus 
was set on fire in Kusayfah; no one was hurt, and the police 
arrested three rioters there. Rocks were hurled at reporters in 
Tel Sheva'. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that riots 
also take place in 'Aro'er and Laggiyah, and the police are 
trying to restore order. The 'Arad-Beersheba highway is still 
closed in the Kusayfah region. 
  In al-Tayyibah in the triangle, masked youths armed with 
axes 
staged a demonstration and set tires on fire.

  [Text] Jerusalem believes that the Palestinians will show 
up for the continuation of the talks in Washington this week. 
Prime Minister Rabin last night spoke on the phone with 
Presidents Clinton and Mubarak mainly on how to secure the 
continuation of the peace talks. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht 
reports: 
  [Begin Hecht recording] In Jerusalem, the Hebron massacre is 
being compared with the deadly mortar shell in the Sarajevo 
marketplace. Jerusalem hopes the shock, here just as there, will 
make the parties realize that there is no other way but to join 
in an effort to complete the negotiations as quickly as possible. 
  The comparison with Sarajevo was mentioned more than once in 
the discussion the prime minister held last night with U.S. 
President Clinton, who called after midnight. He reiterated his 
personal commitment to the success of the peace process. 
Egypt's President Mubarak also called the prime minister and 
updated him on Yasir 'Arafat's difficulties in dealing with his 
fellow PLO leaders. 
  The way to bring the PLO back to the negotiating table also 
goes through Moscow. The Russian foreign minister last night 
spoke to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and promised his help. 
Kozyrev also spoke to Yasir 'Arafat. 
  This, therefore, is the message Jerusalem delivered to Tunis 
through Washington, Cairo, and Moscow: Do not be silly; do not 
let terrorism win. We are also having a hard time with our 
excited opposition. We have always distinguished between 
handling terror and making the effort to bring peace. The prime 
minister knows that the resolutions the cabinet will pass this 
morning should cushion 'Arafat's way back to the talks. 
  Following recommendations from the attorney general, Rabin 
will present the ministers with several ideas, such as imposing 
travel restrictions on Kakh activists, disarming extreme 
settlers, and deporting the hard core of the settlers from 
Hebron. Rabin will brief the ministers about the imminent 
release of Palestinian prisoners. He has not yet accepted the 
idea of setting up a state commission of inquiry. This is 
public relations, the prime minister said, this is no real 
answer. [end recording] 
  Last night, Prime Minister Rabin met with 70 foreign 
ambassadors in Israel, including the U.S. and Russian 
ambassadors. In the meeting, Rabin for the first time revealed 
that the negotiations will resume in Washington on 2 March. 
Sheli Yehimovich reports: 
  [Begin Yehimovich recording] We, the prime minister told the 
ambassadors, immediately accepted the U.S. invitation to come to 
Washington and resume the talks there on 2 March. We do not 
have any information regarding the PLO response, and we expect 
developments in the coming week. I understand the shock the 
Palestinians are in. After all, they were the victims, but I 
expect them to follow our example. We also suffered casualties 
of terror acts, yet we made a distinction between this and the 
political process. I expect the Palestinians not to create a 
linkage or conditioning between this incident and the political 
process. 
  The ambassadors only asked a few questions: Did the 
assailant have personal motives, or was he a member of an 
ideological group? The prime minister said: There is no proof 
that the act was part of an organized activity. As far as we 
know, this dreadful and mad act was perpetrated by a single 
individual. 
  Will Israel make more compromises? the ambassadors asked. 
Israel will do everything to speed up the process, Rabin said. 
We are very close to concluding an agreement on the security 
issues, but there are several macroeconomic problems. This is 
not a question of making compromises, he said. We are 
committed to the Declaration of Principles. Both sides must 
make compromises in negotiations. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has commented publicly 
for the first time on the decisions made at today's cabinet 
session. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] Speaking in English to delegates 
at the fifth conference of Jewish media, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin sharply condemned the massacre in Hebron and said that the 
peace process must continue. The prime minister was later 
interviewed by Israeli correspondents and here is Yitzhaq 
Rabin's first comment on the dramatic decisions made at today's 
cabinet session. The prime minister was first asked about his 
initial objection to the cabinet's ultimate decision to 
establish of a state commission of inquiry on the massacre in 
Hebron. 
  [Rabin] I think that we could have managed without it. I 
think that it will occupy the attention of many military 
elements because it is a state commission of inquiry. I assume 
that everyone will want an attorney to look into how to prepare 
his defense. I think it will divert a great deal of attention 
from the main goal. However, since the issue was brought up with 
the support of several cabinet ministers, and since I do not 
fear the findings of such a commission -- especially not with 
regard to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the defense 
establishment in general -- I would prefer not to sidetrack the 
main effort of getting the peace negotiations back on track by 
starting arguments over whether or not a commission of inquiry 
should be set up. Therefore, let us appoint such a commission. 
  [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, to how many of the radical 
settlers do today's cabinet decisions apply? 
  [Rabin] The security forces, the IDF, and jurists will 
examine each case. Each such proceeding -- and we even decided 
on administrative detentions -- will be carried out by the 
military commander; or in other words, the right of appeal will 
be heard before a military appeals committee with a military 
judge and not by the defense minister and a civilian judge from 
an Israeli District Court, as was the case in the past. 
  [Segal] Are we talking about individual cases, or dozens, 
hundreds, or thousands of people? 
  [Rabin] I do not want to specify numbers. This decision 
does not deal with numbers or isolated steps. This is a policy 
which we will implement on a selective basis whenever required 
against certain people. I think that such people, while only a 
small minority among the settlers, constitute the focal point of 
friction, especially, but not only, in the Hebron area. The 
cabinet's decisions apply solely to them and not to the great 
majority of settlers in the territories. 
  [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, the PLO has already rejected 
today's cabinet decisions as insufficient. What is your 
reaction to this? 
  [Rabin] The cabinet's decisions were adopted by the Israeli 
Government which decides what will happen. If some people do 
not like them, then that is a pity. 
  [Segal] Could this hinder the resumption of the peace talks? 
  [Rabin] These are our decisions. I see no reason not to 
resume the negotiations unless the PLO and the Palestinians want 
to reward someone who not only murdered Palestinians but sought 
to murder the peace process. 
  [Segal] Mr. Rabin, the country is on fire. There is rioting 
in the territories, in Yafo, and even in the Bedouin settlements 
in the Negev. What in your opinion can be done to stop this 
wave of rioting? 
  [Rabin] The despicable murder carried out in Hebron against 
worshipers at a site holy to both Jews and Muslims has 
undoubtedly inflamed passions. Just try to imagine what would 
have happened had such a massacre taken place at a holy site 
where Jews were praying. Would we not all be up in arms? 
  [Segal] Mr. Prime Minister, do you believe that the talks 
with the PLO in Washington could resume this week? 
  [Rabin] As far as Israel is concerned, the answer is yes. 
The ball is currently in the PLO's court. 
  [Segal] In his speech earlier this evening, Rabin revealed 
that the state commission of inquiry would be chaired by Supreme 
Court Justice Me'ir Shamgar. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Rabin made a comment about the 
massacre a short time ago in an address to the International 
Jewish Media Conference in Jerusalem. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] So far, we know that he did it on 
his own but I am also ashamed about others that came out 
publicly and supported his act. I believe that they represent a 
very small number of the people of Israel, even a small number 
among the settlers that oppose the policy of the present 
Government of Israel. He tried not just to kill innocent 
Palestinians while they were praying in a holy place. He joined 
with the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic 
Jihad in the purpose to kill the peace negotiations. [end

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Prime Minister's Office says 
the announcement by Arab delegations that they are pulling out 
of the coming round of the Washington peace talks was to have 
been expected. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is to address the 
Knesset this afternoon on the Hebron massacre and its aftermath. 
David Ze'ev has details: 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] The Prime Minister's Office says it 
expected the PLO to join the other Arab delegations in staying 
away this week from negotiations in Washington, though Yitzhaq 
Rabin's media adviser Gad Ben-Ari said it would be contrary to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement that PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat had agreed to attend accelerated self-rule negotiations 
in the American capital this week in light of the Hebron 
massacre. 
  Still, the Prime Minister's Office says Mr. Rabin 
anticipated 
the move by the Arab delegations. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister is to appear before the Knesset plenum 
this afternoon to present a government statement in the 
aftermath of the Hebron massacre. The Knesset Presidium is to 
meet at this hour and will determine the format of the 
deliberation that will follow the premiers' statement: how many 
Knesset members are to speak and for how long. Before this 
afternoon's Plenum session, Rabin is to appear before the Labor 
caucus. The meeting is being closed to the media. The subjects 
on the agenda are the Hebron massacre and its repercussions and 
the state health bill, a hot issue threatening the coalition 
just a few days ago, now almost forgotten. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] David Ze'ev reports from the 
Knesset that a decision has been reached to keep the debate on 
the Hebron massacre relatively short. Only one representative of 
each party's faction will be given the opportunity to speak.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Yaron Enosh; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Enosh] We have just heard that the PLO has 
decided to recall its representatives to the talks with Israel 
in Cairo, Paris, and Washington for consultations in Tunis. We 
want your reaction, sir. 
  [Peres] I do not know this for a fact, and I would not rush 
to react. There are always rumors and decisions reported, and I 
would rather wait for the most official announcement before I 
make any comment. There is no doubt in my mind, however, that 
what happened in Hebron yesterday greatly complicates the 
negotiations. This madman brought a moral disgrace upon our 
people. It also caused a deterioration in our political 
standing, and I do not take this lightly at all. This will not 
only speed up the negotiations, it will make them more 
complicated, more difficult; this is clear as day. We cannot 
turn this entire country into a madhouse, even if there are a 
few madmen. Madmen should be put away. 
  [Enosh] We have heard remarks from people who support the 
act. 
  [Peres] You should not have broadcasted them. It is a 
shame, a disgrace. Their remarks are shameful. 
  [Enosh] This could mean, however, that we are dealing with 
more than just an individual; perhaps a large group of people 
who support him? 
  [Peres] Look, whoever does not meet the criteria set by the 
law, should be outlawed. One cannot shoot and murder people and 
come up with stories. That group of people who justify the act 
are no angels from heaven, nor do they represent the people of 
Israel. They have no authority, and they should not brag. They 
gave the Jewish people a very sad day, a moral disgrace, and 
with all due respect for the Cave of Patriarchs, the Ten 
Commandments are not less sacred. There it says: Thou shalt 
not kill; and they have killed. 
  [Enosh] Are you saying that measures should be taken against 
these people? 
  [Peres] I believe that people who do not respect the law, 
should be outlawed. 
  [Enosh] Yesterday's cabinet meeting discussed some of the 
measures. What more do you believe should be done to prevent 
such things from recurring and such remarks from being uttered? 
  [Peres] We decided that we will make resolutions tomorrow. 
I will be at tomorrow's cabinet session, and speak there. I 
will state, however, that there is no doubt that the harshest 
and clearest measures must be taken to prevent the fire of 
hatred from bursting out of this place and prevent the violation 
of all human norms. The Jewish people are a humanitarian 
nation. It is not a nation of murderers who shoot innocent 
people. None of them has a right to justify this shameful act. 
  [Enosh] I would like to move on to the political issues, 
in view of the loathsome murders in Hebron. Israel has, in 
fact, reneged on one of the principles it insisted on for quite 
a long time, and agreed to moving the security talks with PLO 
out of the region, out of Taba. 
  [Peres] There is no doubt that at this stage we must save 
the negotiations. Certainly, yesterday's incident places an 
enormous burden on us. There is no point in playing down the 
crime or the damage it caused. Certainly it made our standing 
more difficult, and certainly we are no longer free to do 
whatever we want. Israel is greatly interested today in 
demonstrating that indeed it means peace; real peace, not the 
peace of madmen. 
  [Enosh] We have heard that political sources in Jerusalem 
said that this will speed up.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] I do not know who those sources are, 
and I do not know what they said. It is absolutely clear that 
matters are very complicated now. We scored no achievement nor 
half an achievement, and there is no point in portraying this as 
such. The incident harmed us and caused us damage despite the 
fact that it was done by a single madman who feeds on a larger 
madness. 
  [Enosh] The PLO, through its UN representative, is currently 
demanding that an international force be placed in the area 
because, it claims, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the 
State of Israel are unable to maintain order in the territories. 
This is a very complicated call from our point of view, but do 
you believe such a resolution could ever pass? 
  [Peres] Absolutely not. We have seen multinational forces 
in Somalia and Bosnia. Such a force cannot bring about peace. 
Peace is the business of politicians. Regrettably, a 
multinational force has never succeeded in its task, be it in 
Angola, Somalia, Bosnia, or Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Ya'el Dan and Mikha Friedman "earlier today"; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Friedman] In the cabinet session today, a demand 
will be made that a state commission of inquiry be set up and 
that the Hebron settlers be disarmed. What is your position? 
  [Peres] They went too far this time. They want to bring 
disaster to the Jewish nation. These people represent 
everything which contradicts the moral stands of Jewish people, 
not to mention the political stands. In no way should we let 
this go without a response. We must not be intimidated by them. 
They must not be given a free hand. The damage they have 
caused is hard to imagine. 
  You know, on occasion, the settlers compare themselves with 
those who have been working the land in Israeli kibbutzim and 
moshavim. In 80 years of our settling this land, there was never 
an incident such as shooting at university students, at a bus, 
or at worshipers who pray in the Cave of the Patriarchs from the 
back. These are terrible phenomena. And what makes the blood 
boil even more are the pictures of the people who speak with 
near satisfaction about the incident. This group is a disaster 
for the Jewish people. They should be barred from having any 
possibility of using firearms. 
  [Dan] Many practical questions emerge now regarding the 
means that should be taken against this population. There is 
talk about disarming them, deporting them, placing them under 
administrative detention, and so on. What do you think? 
  [Peres] I say that the most far-reaching steps should be 
taken, naturally subject to legal considerations. This morning, 
at the cabinet session, I will hear the legal considerations. 
  [Friedman] Meaning that you first want to hear out the 
attorney general? 
  [Peres] Absolutely. 
  [Dan] Let us be more specific: Should they be disarmed? 
  [Peres] I would not want to engage in this. A minister 
should not discuss this on the radio; we have a cabinet session 
for this. I do not believe that every minister should point to 
his personal position. The government should take a bold, 
serious, far-reaching stand. The disaster is twofold: One is 
what they did, the other is our fearing them. This is a 
disaster as well. 
  [Friedman] Do you regret today the move of a previous 
government in which you served to set up the settlement of 
Qiryat Arba' at the heart of Arab Hebron. 
  [Peres] What difference does it make today? The reason to 
set up Qiryat Arba' was to avoid settling in the heart of 
Hebron. Eventually, they set up Qiryat Arba' but also settled in 
Hebron. Everything we were afraid of actually happened. We knew 
in advance that a settlement in Hebron would lead to bloody 
events. We knew it was only a matter of time before they take 
place and cast a shadow on the whole enterprise. Therefore, 
even if such a decision was made, it was carried out in a 
twisted manner. 
  [Friedman] And now, Mr. Peres, there is a political process 
at the end of which, when the negotiations are completed, a 
Palestinian autonomy will be set up in the territories. Do you 
believe such an autonomy can be effectively managed in a way 
that would eventually lead us to a comprehensive peace agreement 
with the Palestinians, when such a nucleus resides in the heart 
of Arab Hebron? Or should they be evacuated from there? 
  [Peres] This nucleus will not manage the State of Israel nor 
the policy of Israel. This is not the first time that Jewish 
factions depart from the nation. We will not allow such people 
to manage the State of Israel, on its or on our behalf. The 
appropriate measures should be taken. We are not a miserable 
nation. We have the power not to allow murderers to represent 
the Jewish people.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has expressed regret 
over the PLO's decision to put off the resumption of the 
negotiations with Israel. Peres told our correspondent Menahem 
Friedman that the government had approved tough steps against 
all manifestations of murder and violence or attempts to 
undermine the peace process. Foreign Minister Peres said there 
was a small group of people who posed a real danger to national 
security. The people who attended the murderer's funeral and 
shouted that he was a martyr pose a danger to Israel's future. 
The foreign minister nevertheless stressed that the 
Palestinians had no better alternative than resuming the peace 
process.

  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1540 GMT on 25 February carries live interviews with Ministers 
Sarid and Shahal who formulated the announcement issued by the 
government at the end of its special meeting today. 
  In the course of his interview, Minister Sarid expresses his 
belief that an inquiry commission should be set up, as proposed 
in the cabinet meeting, stressing though that "there is no doubt 
that today's murder was carried out by a single individual who 
acted alone. He was the only shooter." As for how he managed 
to carry out his act in the Cave of the Patriarchs unhindered by 
the Army, Sarid says: "An explanation was given by the Army. I 
believe it should be given by the Army. There was a door there 
which should have been locked, and the officer who was in charge 
of the scene at the time tried to enter the prayer hall but was 
pushed back by the crowd of worshipers who fled outside." 
Minister Sarid also emphasizes the decision by the commander of 
the Central Command, as reported to the cabinet today, on the 
curfew imposed on Jews in Hebron "who are allowed to move freely 
only in their area of residence, but, for the first time, are 
not allowed to enter the town of Hebron. As for Qiryat Arba', 
the closure means it is possible to enter and exit Qiryat Arba' 
only at a special request for permission from the IDF." 
  During his interview, Police Minister Shahal is asked 
whether 
today's incident is not the result of police's helplessness in 
enforcing the law on the settlers, specifically Kakh members. 
He responded that the police are not responsible for public 
order in the territories at all. Still, in its capacity of 
opening files against criminals, the police does so when 
evidence is collected, but "there was no concrete material" 
against this morning's murderer, except for talk which took 
place a few months ago [reference is to the radio interview 
cited in second referent item]. Israel is a country of law, and 
"in this and other cases, when the material was brought up by 
the Shin Bet and other elements, the conclusion was that there 
were not sufficient evidence to put the persons involved on 
trial." If material and evidence warrant, then per the attorney 
general and as proposed in the cabinet meeting today, 
individuals can also be removed or exiled.

<F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO 
have pledged to turn the terrible carnage in a Hebron mosque 
into a catalyst for peace in fresh talks under US auspices next 
week. 
  "Paradoxically the tragedy leaves Israel and the PLO no 
alternative but to accelerate the peace negotiations so that the 
PLO can take control in the territories as soon as possible," an 
Israeli minister, who asked not to be named, told AFP. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
agreed to U.S. President Bill Clinton's appeal not to allow the 
massacre to undermine recent achievements and to hold new 
negotiations that will continue in Washington until a resolution 
is reached. 
  The minister said "damage control" contacts over the last 24 
hours between Israel and the PLO as well as with the Americans 
and Europeans had proved positive. 
  "Everyone agrees that we have to push ahead with peace," the 
minister said. "The negotiations could go very fast now." 
  There is no problem with the Palestinian leadership, what we 
fear is the Palestinian street. 
  "The coming days will be crucial. Things could get out of 
control in the territories." 
  For that reason, on top of international condemnation, 
Israel 
was under great pressure to come up with some real gestures such 
as an early release of Palestinian prisoners, to keep a lid on 
the violence, he said. Rabin was weighing his next move on 
Saturday, the minister added. 
  "The decision to punish the settlers by closing off Qiryat 
Arba' and to compensate Palestinian families is important. 
Symbolic measures such as closing off the killer's house or 
even blowing it up, as happens with the Palestinians, are under 
consideration," he revealed. 
  He said he hoped that ultimately the massacre could reduce 
the period of autonomy to under five years, allowing an early 
transition to a final settlement on the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. [passage omitted] 
  Rabin pledged the killing would not halt the peace train. 
  "The crazy act of a pyschopath will not prevent the 
reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians and will not 
stop the peace process," he vowed. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres added: "If anyone thinks such 
criminal acts will slow the peace efforts, they are sorely 
mistaken." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Minister Ya'ir Tzaban has said that in tomorrow's 
cabinet session he will again demand that all of the Kahanist 
organizations be outlawed and that the concentrations of 
settlers be moved out of Hebron. 
  Minister Amnon Rubinstein also said that tomorrow he will 
support the suggestions to outlaw Kakh members and supporters, 
to distance them from Qiryat Arba', disarm them, and not draft 
them to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. He told our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht that the upsetting remarks Kakh 
members made on Qol Yisra'el's weekly newsreel prove that the 
extremist settlers' moral standards have drastically 
deteriorated.

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq today visited the Cave of 
the Patriarchs and the Hebron area with senior IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] officers and conducted a debriefing of 
yesterday's incidents. After reaching his conclusions 
Lieutenant General Baraq convened a news conference, which was 
attended by our correspondent Karmela Menashe: 
  [Begin recording] [Baraq] Early yesterday morning a 
shocking murder was carried out by a lunatic in this place. He 
murdered innocent people on a holy day in a place of worship 
which is holy to both religions. We are deeply grieved by this 
terrible and unnecessary loss of life and share the sorrow of 
the families, the residents of Hebron and the entire Palestinian 
people and its leadership. We will do everything possible to 
determine as best we can the circumstances of the incident 
itself and the ensuing events and will do everything possible to 
minimize the chances of the recurrence of such events. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have any picture of what 
happened inside these halls? 
  [Baraq] Dr. Goldstein entered early morning and apparently 
opened fire from one of the passages connecting the two prayer 
areas -- it is still unclear which passage. He opened fire at 
the group of worshipers who were praying in the Muslim hall. I 
cannot determine the facts beyond this yet. The entire issue is 
under a thorough investigation. I have no doubts that in the 
wake of this investigation the entire picture will become clear. 
This is the situation. To the best of my knowledge Dr. 
Goldstein was the only one who fired shots inside this hall. 
  [Menashe] The chief of staff was also asked whether steps 
will be implemented against the settlers in Qiryat Arba' and 
Hebron. 
  [Baraq] At this point I am not qualified to say whether any 
steps will be implemented. Right now there is a curfew in 
Hebron and a closure on the Jewish settlement. This situation 
will continue for the time being. 
  [Menashe] Will you change the procedures and the soldiers' 
operation in this area? 
  [Baraq] We will implement whatever recommendations will 
surface in light of the investigation. An investigation is 
being carried at the division level and a debriefing by 
Brigadier General Agmon on behalf of the General Staff. I have 
no doubts that the events which occurred here and the incident 
which happened near the hospital [not further specified] will be 
thoroughly investigated. I am convinced that we will do whatever 
is necessary after the investigation is completed. 
  For years hundreds of Muslims and Israelis have been praying 
side by side -- at times simultaneously-- and there are quite a 
few passages connecting the two areas in this intricate 
structure. 
  [Menashe] The chief of staff was asked for his opinion 
regarding the demand for an inquiry commission, as demanded by 
some ministers. 
  [Baraq] The Police are conducting a criminal investigation 
of this incident, and I have no doubts it will exhaust all the 
criminal responsibility in this incident. The Central Command 
and the General Staff have also appointed officers to 
investigate the incident. We have no reservations or opposition 
to any other investigations. We have no position regarding this 
question. 
  [Menashe] Lt. Gen. Baraq also met the leaders and 
dignitaries of Hebron. 
  [Baraq] I met Hebron's mayor and a group of dignitaries and 
expressed our deep shock at this despicable crime, as well as 
the IDF's and the entire Israeli people's denunciation of this 
incident, and our determination to do whatever we can to 
ascertain exactly what happened and to prevent the recurrence of 
such incidents. 
  [Menashe] Chief of Staff Baraq, who held the news conference 
near the Cave of the Patriarchs, emphasized that apparently 
there should have been border policemen stationed near the Cave 
of the Patriarchs yesterday, but they were not there. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- 
passages in Italics recorded in English] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The Israeli Government will meet 
tomorrow. We imagine how important this meeting will be, 
particularly since measures will be taken against the settlers, 
or, at least, the extremist ones. 
  Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin supplied us with 
important information. We asked him about the nature of the 
measures the Rabin government could take tomorrow. 
  [Beilin] Well, I prefer to wait for tomorrow, because 
decisions will be taken tomorrow. But, I can already say that, 
for the first time, there was a curfew on an Israeli settlement 
in the West Bank. It never happened in the past, and I think 
that we should see whether there are some legal ways to outlaw 
those very extreme organizations which went out saying that they 
should act in a violent way against the peace process. 
  [Announcer] As for disarming the settlers, as Palestinians 
are calling for, Yosi Beilin believes this demand is not 
realistic. 
  [Beilin] I do not believe this demand is a realistic 
one. After all, after so many years, we are going to have in 
the territories, in Gaza and Jericho, a strong Palestinian 
police. I do not think it is possible and reasonable, when this 
police will be armed, to disarm the settlers after 26 years. 
What is important is to prevent the dangerous among them to be 
armed, and to go for a full solution, so that in the future, 
something like that will not happen. I think that if any such 
demand is becoming a condition, it will just delay the process 
and will be the best prize for those who would not like to see a 
peace process in our part of the world. 
  [Announcer] There is another Palestinian demand expressed by 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and Faruq Qaddumi in his interview 
with our radio, that of sending international forces to protect 
the Palestinians. Here too, the Israeli deputy foreign minister 
does not believe this demand is a wise one. 
  [Beilin] I do not believe that now, on the verge of the 
implementation of the Oslo agreement, it would be wise on both 
sides to invite international forces. But, you have to take 
into consideration that in Oslo, we agreed together that as part 
of the implementation of the agreement, there would be an 
international presence in the autonomy. So, I do not believe 
that now speaking about something which is different from that 
is a wise thing to do.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is to resume its debate 
of the Hebron massacre this evening. A short while ago in 
Jerusalem, Israeli officials were informed that the U.S. will 
support a Security Council resolution which expresses regret 
over the events in Hebron, and calls on Israel to take all 
measures to restore calm to the area. Israeli officials are 
said to be pleased with the American position. The PLO has 
demanded that the Security Council resolution make an 
announcement to send international forces to the territories to 
protect Palestinian civilians. The Security Council started 
discussing the situation last night. Judy Lessing filed this 
report from New York: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Lessing] Islamic 
countries have given the Council a draft resolution. The United 
States has taken the lead in writing a statement. So the two 
sides will consult and work out the way the Council will condemn 
the massacre. The Council president said the resolution was 
fairly mild, the statement has much stronger wording. He said 
neither is critical of the Israeli Army, but is of the settlers. 
Ambassador Gad Ya'aqobi understands something similar. 
  [Ya'aqobi] To the best of my knowledge none of the proposals 
here is condemning Israel, and we condemned as well the murder, 
the act of this lunatic murderer, so there is no proposal to 
condemn Israel on this matter. 
  [Lessing] The PLO has said it was clear settlers should be 
disarmed, but Ambassador Ya'aqobi wasn't ready to agree to this 
step. 
  [Ya'aqobi] If you will assure me the total disarming of the 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad, which 
killed many settlers and many other Jewish people in Israel 
lately, then I will be able to consider this question. 
  [Lessing] Ambassador Ya'aqobi would prefer to see a 
statement calling for quick progress in the PLO-Israel 
negotiations, rather than a resolution, because the massacre was 
carried out by a single person, and wasn't done by a country or 
a people. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Meretz demands that a state commission of inquiry 
be set up to investigate the incidents in Hebron, and that an 
Israeli Arab with legal education be a member of its board. 
  In the cabinet session today, Meretz ministers will demand 
that all the extreme settlers who advocate murder be arrested at 
once; that extremists be taken out of Tal al-Rumaydah, Hadassah 
House, and Romano House in the heart of Hebron; that the Army be 
instructed not to shoot at Palestinians in the territories; and 
that all that has so far been agreed on in the talks with the 
PLO be implemented at once. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent Sheli 
Yehimovich that Meretz will also demand that the Kakh Movement 
be outlawed. According to her, we should make a distinction 
between idiots who speak out of their stupidity, and real 
instigators. She added that the remarks by Police Minister 
Moshe Shahal that the police are dealing with Arab and Jewish 
murderers along the same criteria are not true, and there is 
discrimination. 
  At the same time, she opposes the demand that the house of 
Barukh Goldstein be sealed, just as she opposes sealing the 
homes of Arabs. Minister Aloni added that the reserved 
condemnation of the Hebron massacre by the settler leaders 
borders on racism and viciousness. She added that Goldstein was 
not operating in a vacuum. In Israel, there is a nursery of 
Arab-hating racists who are after Arabs' lives and property, she 
said.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Me'ir Einstein; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Einstein] Were you surprised by the Arab decision 
to suspend the talks? 
  [Beilin] It is hard to say that I was surprised but this is 
definitely a worrisome development which should not be 
disregarded. I think that the next step should be the United 
States getting into the thick of things in order to prevent any 
exacerbation that could ultimately present all the parties with 
a situation they may not have initially wanted. Such a 
development may, God forbid, preclude the continuation of the 
talks. 
  [Einstein] You speak of deeper U.S. involvement in the 
talks. Perhaps from our point of view this may lead to greater 
pressure on Israel? 
  [Beilin] No, definitely not. We are not worried about U.S. 
pressure on Israel. There is a high level of coordination 
between the United States and Israel. We know that the U.S. 
Administration is highly interested in promoting the peace 
process. On no account would the United States want the 
situation to deteriorate. Now, after this terrible act, Israel 
would have a hard time directly persuading the Syrians and 
Lebanese to return to the talks. We are also having a hard time 
with the PLO in this respect. I believe that right now the 
Americans could be helpful in this. 
  [Einstein] Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin, should Israel 
perhaps be more forthcoming toward the PLO, or were yesterday's 
cabinet decisions sufficient? 
  [Beilin] I believe that the decisions made yesterday 
constitute a precedent. Such decisions have never been taken 
before. 
  [Einstein] But nevertheless? 
  [Beilin] I do not see any room for additional decisions with 
regard to what happened in Hebron and the ramifications of that 
terrible deed. Israel can now tell the world that it has done 
all it could, and I very much hope that it will now be easier to 
resume the political process despite all the natural and 
understandable difficulties. 
  [Einstein] Thank you, Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F>
Uri Paz and Ya'el Dan on 28 February; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Paz] Earlier this morning, we spoke with Minister 
Yosi Sarid and asked for his reaction to the suspension of the 
peace negotiations with the Arab delegations in Washington. 
  [Sarid] Clearly I was sad to learn last night of the 
decision to break off the Washington talks. I regret the 
decision but I cannot say that I was surprised. Already last 
Friday [25 February], the day of the massacre, it was obvious 
that such an event could not simply pass without leaving its 
mark on the talks. It was hard to imagine that it would just 
continue to be business as usual. Nevertheless, the fact that 
the talks are being halted is cause for a great deal of sorrow, 
frustration, and disappointment because, as has already been 
noted, the desire of this evil man, this Jekyll and Hyde, was to 
stop the talks and this is indeed happening. There is nothing 
worse than granting murderers what they want. 
  [Paz] In your opinion, can we talk about long-term damage to 
the peace process this morning? 
  [Sarid] I very much hope not. I therefore appeal to the 
Palestinian leadership to consider this period merely as a short 
time out, which will be followed by an immediate resumption of 
the negotiations. 
  [Dan] What will bring them back to the negotiating table? 
  [Sarid] Look, I do not demand anything of the Palestinian 
leadership that we have not already demanded of ourselves. The 
Israeli leadership has also faced extremely difficult challenges 
in recent weeks. There have been many terrorist attacks since 
13 September, and we vividly remember each and every one of 
them. The familiar voices calling for a halt in the 
negotiations and the abandonment of the peace process were heard 
in Israel. Some new voices even joined in the chorus. We 
rejected these demands. It was difficult and painful. We had 
to clench our fists and bite our lips, but we nevertheless 
proceeded, and, I might say, even stuck to the peace process 
with more conviction and resoluteness. Now it is the turn of 
the Palestinian leadership to follow the example set by their 
Israeli counterparts. Our Palestinian colleagues are going 
through a tough period. I realize that these are difficult days 
and that they are very upset. This is certainly understandable 
and we will wait several days in the hope and faith that we will 
all return to Washington next week to continue talking because 
we have no other alternative. 
  [Paz] Minister Sarid, one more question. Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel would make no additional 
concessions to the PLO in order to bring them back to the 
negotiating table. Is refusing to make any further concessions 
indeed the correct approach? Perhaps we should make some 
concessions to demonstrate our goodwill and improve the 
atmosphere? 
  [Sarid] I have two things to say to that. One, I think that 
yesterday's cabinet decisions provide a good basis for the 
continuation of the negotiations. These very important and 
unprecedented decisions in my opinion indicate the government's 
readiness and commitment to confront the radical elements in 
Israel, control and restrain their activities, and if necessary 
even totally suppress them. That is one thing. Second, I would 
like to issue a warning about reopening understandings. Now 
they want to reopen the agreement because of what happened in 
Hebron. Tomorrow, God forbid, there may be another terrorist 
attack and this or that party will make additional demands to 
reopen and change things. There will be no end to this and the 
agreement will totally disintegrate. An agreement is not a 
zipper that one opens and closes at will. 
  [Dan] But what will bring the Arab delegations back to the 
talks? 
  [Sarid] A sense of responsibility and the lack of other 
alternatives. 
  [Dan] Thank you very much, Minister Yosi Sarid.

  [Text] Tourism Minister 'Uzi Bar'am has demanded the 
immediate evacuation of all the settlers from Hebron, Bet 
Hadassah, Bet Romano, and Tall al-Rumaythah. Minister Bar'am 
estimated that another four or five cabinet ministers supported 
his position. In his opinion, yesterday's cabinet decisions 
were insufficient and did not meet the urgent need to halt a 
deterioration of the situation. Minister Bar'am was speaking in 
an interview to Qol Yisra'el. 
  Immigrant Absorption Minister Ya'ir Tzaban said that he had 
information that reserve IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers 
were training groups from the Jewish Defense League, Kakh, and 
Kahana Hay in the United States. Tzaban told Qol Yisra'el that 
last year, the Kahana Hay movement had trained 200 youths in New 
York. Three graduates of that course arrived in Israel and 
embarked on violent tours of the territories. Minister Tzaban 
called for a ban on entry into Israel for members of these 
groups.

  [Text] Transportation Minister Yisra'el Qeysar has 
demanded that the prime minister ban the Kakh movement. Qeysar 
also demanded new criteria for gun permits to settlers in Judaea 
and Samaria. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer called for the dismantling of the Jewish 
settlements situated in the heart of Arab population centers. 
Ben-Eli'ezer was interviewed on IDF Radio by Qobi Meydan. 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-Eli'ezer] In my opinion, we have only 
two choices: one choice is to deploy an entire brigade to guard 
them and the second alternative is to dismantle these 
settlements. 
  [Meydan] In other words you are talking about dismantling 
these settlements for all practical purposes? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] Why for all practical purposes? Today these 
settlements are the focal point for tension and potential 
pogroms. I say that we have two choices: either guard them day 
and night while also watching and controlling their every step 
or we dismantle them. There is nothing else to do. 
  [Meydan] If you had the choice, Mr. Ben-Eli'ezer, of either 
bringing in a brigade to watch over ten settlers or to dismantle 
the settlement, what would you decide? 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] If the decision was up to me I would 
dismantle it. I am talking about certain, specific settlements. 
One cannot continue dreaming about autonomy and coexistence. 
One cannot go along with the process when you see people 
forcefully leading toward a violent confrontation. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador to the United States Itamar </F>
Rabinovich by correspondent Arye Golan in Washington on 25 
February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich, what effect will 
the massacre have on the peace talks? 
  [Rabinovich] We do not know yet. We are not dealing here 
with speculations or expectations. There is ongoing activity in 
Israel, the United States, and in other capitals to contain the 
damage and try to prevent negative effects on the peace process. 
We are maintaining ongoing contacts with the peace team in the 
U.S. Administration. We expect there will be high-level 
contacts between the Israeli Government and the U.S. 
Administration later today. I think President Clinton will 
address the issue later today. All this is intended to prevent, 
or at least minimize, the damages to the peace process. 
  [Golan] Did you speak with our Arab interlocutors to the 
peace talks? 
  [Rabinovich] Not yet, but such contacts will take place 
later today. 
  [Golan] Have you heard what they are saying to the Americans 
now? 
  [Rabinovich] No, I do not think there is any explicit 
message from them yet. I think the Arab side, like us, is still 
unclear about the events, some of which are unfortunately still 
going on. 
  [Golan] They did not say they are halting the talks and 
returning home, did they? 
  [Rabinovich] No, there was no such announcement. 
  [Golan] What do the Americans intend to do in order to calm 
tempers down? 
  (Rabinovich] I think right now the Americans are holding 
internal consultations, with us and with the Arab and 
Palestinian side. I think they have still not consolidated any 
concrete policy. This will probably take place in the next few 
hours. 
  [Golan] How do the Americans regard the Palestinian demand 
to disarm the settlers? 
  [Rabinovich] I do not think the Americans believe the time 
has come to address such concrete issues. This is not the key 
issue when we are trying to figure out how to save the peace 
process from severe harm. I assume that if such a request was 
submitted to the Americans they would have known how to rank it 
on the list of priorities. 
  [Golan] How will the Security Council deal with this issue 
when it is submitted to it? 
  [Rabinovich] It is too early to assess what will happen in 
the Security Council, because the format for dealing with this 
issue has still not been determined. We must remember that the 
Security Council can meet on various levels and forms, and so 
far this issue has not been determined.

  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense 
minister, has decided to transfer the security in the Cave of 
the Patriarchs from the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to the 
Border Police. This was divulged today by Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal. Our police affairs correspondent Uri Kohen-Aharonov 
reports the battalion-strong force will collect all the weapons 
from the Jewish worshipers. Senior sources in the Police 
Ministry regard this decision as a sign for the transference of 
more powers to the police in the territories. The police 
minister also said he intends to facilitate the erection of a 
security fence above the Western Wall. The proposal to erect 
this fence was one of the main recommendations of the Hefetz 
Committee which investigated the Temple Mount bloodbath three 
years ago. Minister Shahal supported the implementation of the 
recommendation, but so far it was delayed. 
  In a meeting this evening in the defense minister's office 
in 
Tel Aviv it was decided to examine a series of steps to be taken 
against inciting elements from among the settlers in Hebron and 
Qiryat Arba'. The meeting was attended by the prime minister, 
the police minister, the attorney general, and security 
elements. Police Minister Shahal told our correspondent Menashe 
Raz this evening that there is only one law for Jews and Arabs: 
  [Begin recording] [Raz] Mr. Shahal, you just came from a 
consultation held with the prime minister. Have you decided on 
a series of steps to be taken against inciting elements from 
among the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' settlers? 
  [Shahal] I cannot give details. We held a discussion which 
reviewed all the problems. The legal and operational 
ramifications were raised. The discussion was held on a 
professional and general level, without entering the details of 
the issue. The attorney general, the chief of staff, the 
commander of the Central Command and other elements participated 
in the consultation. 
  [Raz] Does the current law in force in the territories allow 
you to deport elements you do not want to remain in the 
territories, or to implement other measures against inciting 
Jewish elements? 
  [Shahal] The authority vested with the commanders of the IDF 
Commands and other military officers are sufficiently broad to 
enable them to implement steps when the commander believes there 
is a danger to the public's security. In order to prevent this 
danger he is entitled to order an administrative detention or to 
remove the persons concerned, or to limit their exit from or 
entrance to certain areas. He can implement these steps on the 
basis of information he possesses and if he believes this is 
necessary to maintain security. In these hours of hardship, 
however, we must not forget that we must preserve civil rights 
and Israel's democracy. 
  [Raz] Are you referring only to Kakh people, or to other 
familiar figures in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron who are not Kakh 
members? 
  [Shahal] We are referring to whoever might pose a danger to 
security and those who intend to carry out attacks or have done 
so in the past. 
  [Raz] Mr. Shahal, in yesterday's cabinet session, ministers 
referred to the necessity of implementing dramatic steps in the 
wake of the new situation. Will one of this dramatic steps be 
implemented in Hebron and Qiryat Arba' in the next few hours? 
  [Shahal] I cannot answer this question. I do not think that 
any dramatic steps are called for. We need a step within the 
limits of the law, to be implemented firmly and without any 
hesitations against whoever tries to break the law. Here we 
will not discriminate: Everybody, no matter what his 
nationality, is subjected to the same law. The Israeli 
Government is bound to act on the basis of this principle, both 
morally and legally. 
  [Raz] Today we have seen that the intifadah crossed the 
Green Line. There were riots in Yafo and in Israeli Arab 
villages. I assume the government is very concerned about this. 
  [Shahal] The prime minister will shortly meet the heads of 
the Israeli Arab sector. I will also attend this meeting. We 
are calling on the Israeli Arab population not to lend 
themselves to incitement and extremists. Relations between the 
Israeli Arab population and the state have always been good. 
They know very well what the government is doing. We are 
calling on them -- and especially on their leadership -- to 
prevent inciters and extremists from gaining control. 
  The Israeli Police are evincing great restraint, but at the 
same time we will firmly prevent any deterioration in the 
situation. This must be very clear to all those who tried to 
violate the law. We are holding several detainees, and we will 
deal with them according to law. I hope tempers will calm down. 
We will continue acting as we have always done, as a law 
abiding country where all the citizens must act according to the 
law. [end recording]

cable to Yasir 'Arafat stating he is shocked and horrified by 
the insane murder of innocent Palestinians at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. Mr. Zvili emphasized the Israeli authorities are 
doing everything to prevent an exacerbation of the situation, 
and that the only way to break out of the circle of violence is 
to concentrate all efforts in order to facilitate the peace 
process. 
  Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports 
opposition leaders will convene this evening to consolidate 
positions in view of the possibility that the government will 
take advantage of the situation in order to facilitate the peace

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Bethlehem Mayor Ilyas Frayj in </F>
Bethlehem by Muhammad al-Aswad in Cairo; date not given; from 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, we welcome you to Voice 
of the Arabs. 
  [Frayj] Thank you. 
  [Al-Aswad] We start this dialogue by asking you to fill us 
in on any of the new dimensions regarding the incident at the 
al- Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn on Friday. 
  [Frayj] The criminal act that took place at dawn on Friday 
at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron can only be explained by the 
fact that it is based on racists who hate the presence of the 
Arabs. Killing worshipers who are kneeling in prayer to God 
Almighty indiscriminately and without prior warning is an 
organized crime with very dangerous political significance. It 
did not take place in a vacuum. All the sons of the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip have been terribly hurt and shocked by this 
act. We are now demanding international protection. We are 
demanding that the criminals in the Israeli settlements be 
disarmed. We are demanding that all worshipers--Muslim, Jew, or 
Christian--be prevented from entering any holy place carrying 
weapons. Under no circumstances should any person be allowed to 
carry weapons in a place of worship. 
  Second, we are demanding that a high-ranking judicial 
committee be formed to investigate the circumstances of the 
crime. This has cast dark shadows on the peace process. How 
can there be peace when the settlers tamper with security as 
they please? The successive Israeli governments for the past 26 
years have not tried to curb the belligerence of the settlers or 
their attacks on Arab citizens. The settlers all over the West 
Bank are trying to occupy Arab lands to expand the territory 
they have. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, what, in your opinion, should the 
scope of Palestinian action be at the United Nations to secure 
international protection for the Palestinian people? 
  [Frayj] We ask the Security Council to provide protection 
for the Palestinian Arab citizens in the occupied territories 
from the attacks of the settlers and the army, which take place 
repeatedly without any deterrent. For example, over 15 
Palestinian youths were killed by the army under false pretexts, 
while not a single Israeli soldier was injured. 
  [Al-Aswad] In light of these circumstances, Mr. Ilyas Frayj, 
who has responsibility for the security of the Palestinian 
citizens? 
  [Frayj] I believe that security is the responsibility of the 
present authority, the responsibility of Israel. Since Israel 
does not provide us with the basic minimum security required, we 
demand that the United Nations and the Security Council form an 
international force to keep the peace and provide security. 
  [Al-Aswad] You noted in this interview that Israel is 
responsible for what happened. What are the limits of this 
responsibility? And is it true what is being said -- that 20-50 
Israeli armed men participated in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre? 
  [Frayj] Israeli sources claim that only one person carried 
out the operation. I doubt that. I hold Israel fully 
responsible for the total security of the Arab citizens and 
residents of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip so long as it 
controls the situation there. Either the Palestinian police 
should be allowed to enter the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
immediately, or an international force should be deployed to 
protect the citizens. However, I insist that the settlers 
should be disarmed and prevented from entering places of worship 
carrying arms. 
  [Al-Aswad] How do you see the general atmosphere in the 
occupied territories after the recent massacre? And will it 
affect the credibility of the current peace process? 
  [Frayj] The vast majority of citizens now do not believe the 
peace negotiations are useful since they do not include the 
issue of the settlers. The vast majority are now confused. 
What is the use of having talks while 120,000 settlers romp and 
kill people in the West Bank for no reason whatsoever? The 
Israeli Army sometimes helps them but it often turns a blind eye 
and does nothing. The settlers are very spoiled and behave like 
cowboys [preceding word in English] in the occupied territories. 
The Israeli settler who committed this crime did it because he 
thought he was a cowboy dealing with Red Indians. 
  [Al-Aswad] Mr. Frayj, thank you for this dialogue on Voice 
of the Arabs.

organization called Shlomtziyon-Yehuda [The Well-Being of 
Zion-Judaea]. He warned that his organization will retaliate to 
every terror attack by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or 
the Islamic Jihad with murders, in Israel or abroad, which will 
be similar to the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The man who 
will carry out the act will never be caught. He will commit 
suicide to sanctify God's name.

  [Text] Gaza City, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Two Islamic 
fundamentalist groups threatened to kill more Jews in revenge 
for the massacre of 52 Palestinians by one or more settlers in a 
West Bank mosque on Friday. 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Islamic 
Resistance Movement HAMAS, warned: "Very soon Israel will be in 
mourning and put up black flags because 'Izz-al-Din will strike 
harder than even the Zionist terrorists can imagine." 
  Islamic Jihad said: "The blood of the people will not be 
shed 
for nothing. 
  "The bullets of the Islamic fighters will be our immediate 
answer to the Zionists." 
  In their statements, the fundamentalists joined the 
Palestine 
Liberation Organization's call for three days of mourning and a 
general strike throughout the occupied territories. 
  The mosque massacre sparked widespread clashes between 
Palestinians and Israeli troops who shot dead nine protestors 
and wounded scores more.

apparently by enraged Arab worshipers. These are the 
conclusions of a preliminary investigation carried out by the 
police investigators. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky was 
informed by the Judaea District Police that Goldstein's skull 
was crushed by blows; there were no gunshots to his body. The 
Police therefore rule out the possibility that Goldstein was 
shot or that he committed suicide, and apparently there will be 
no need to carry out an autopsy.

  [Excerpts] Barukh Goldstein was buried in Qiryat Arba' 
this evening after a funeral procession from Jerusalem. The 
burial site at Qiryat Arba' is temporary, and his body will be 
moved eventually to the Jewish cemetery in Hebron. Speakers 
eulogizing Goldstein praised both the man and his actions. Mark 
Weiss was at the funeral: 
  [Weiss] Eulogies were recited at the Shamgar funeral parlor 
in Jerusalem and at the yeshiva in Qiryat Arba', and the message 
at both venues was militant and uncompromising. Speakers 
praised the massacre as a selfless act committed on behalf of 
the Jewish people as a whole. The victims were described not as 
innocent worshipers, but as the people who stabbed innocent Jews 
and the descendants of the Hebron residents who murdered almost 
the entire Jewish population of the town in 1929. A million 
Arabs are not worth the fingernail of one Jew, said one of the 
speakers. We are all Goldstein, shouted one of the mourners at 
one stage. Again and again, the speakers denounced the 
government and the media, and above all the fact that an armed 
Palestinian police force is about to be established. All this, 
together with the fact that Dr. Goldstein had repeatedly treated 
the victims of Arab terror combined to create a situation where 
he just couldn't take it any more. All the eulogizers said 
Goldstein should be praised as a righteous man. A few hundred 
people attended the eulogies in Jerusalem. Many hundreds more 
joined in at Qiryat Arba'. [passage omitted] 
  For many other mourners, the most radical elements amongst 
the settlers, the funeral was an occasion to come together and 
express solidarity. And, that was definitely the feeling of a 
community under siege. There was intense hostility toward 
journalists, and much of the talk amongst the crowd was of a 
witch hunt and the possibility of informers planted within the 
settlements.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad 
Sa'id al-Sahhaf has strongly condemned the ugly crime the 
Zionist criminals committed against the sons of the Palestinian 
people while they were performing prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
at dawn yesterday. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said 
this appalling crime is a glaring example of racist Zionist 
policy and how the United States and its Western allies react to 
such acts. 
  He said the United States and its Western allies use the 
most 
violent means of interference in response to their supporters' 
allegations about so-called human rights in one country or 
another. But when large numbers of Palestinians are publicly 
killed in a brutal and dirty manner, all that Washington, 
London, and the other Western capitals offer is words. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: The way the United States and 
some Western states reacted to this crime, which is part of the 
genocide that the Palestinian people have been subjected to 
since the partition and consequent usurpation of Palestine, is 
evidence of the double standards the United States and its 
Western allies follow in their dealings with world issues. We 
have always noted these double standards. Wherever the United 
States and its Western allies want to impose their political 
will and their economic interests, they use the UN Security 
Council and international organizations, as well as direct 
force, to achieve their objectives. But when it has something 
to do with peoples' rights and protecting them against genocide, 
U.S. and Western reaction is confined to the shedding of 
crocodile tears, maneuvers, and deception. 
  Concluding his statement, the foreign minister said: The 
world peoples who love peace and justice and truly believe in 
human rights, the peoples who denounced this dirty Zionist crime 
against the people of Palestine, should denounce in the 
strongest way the stand of the United States and some of its 
Western allies on this crime. They should denounce their use of 
double standards toward all fair world and Arab issues, 
primarily the Palestine issue.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, 
member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and 
secretary general of the National Progressive and Patriotic 
Front [NPPF], has stressed that the Zionist massacre in which 
dozens of Palestinian worshipers were martyred and hundreds were 
wounded in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the city of Hebron has 
exposed the true nature of the Zionist plotting against the 
Palestinian people as well as the Zionist attempts to liquidate 
them and destroy their history and civilization. 
  In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH published today, 
'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said that this outrageous massacre 
shows the impossibility of coexistence between the Palestinian 
Arab people and the Zionists who usurped their land. 
  The NPPF secretary general called on the political forces 
and 
parties and human rights committees in the Arab homeland and the 
world to denounce and condemn this crime which the Zionist enemy 
would not have dared to perpetrate without the colonialist U.S. 
collusion with the Zionist enemy, and the continued U.S. support 
to enable it to carry out aggressions against the Palestine 
question, people, and civilization. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur hailed the glorious sacrifices 
of the Palestinian Arab people, and expressed pride in the 
righteous martyrs and victims of the criminal act which was 
perpetrated by the Zionists against Palestinian worshipers at 
the Ibrahimi Mosque in the blessed month of Ramadan. 
  He noted that the escalation of the intifadah in the 
occupied 
Arab territories and the Palestinian people's continued 
confrontation of the colonialist Zionist schemes inside and 
outside the occupied territories constitute the only way to 
achieve the Palestinian people's national and inalienable 
objectives, and not the capitulatory framework in which the 
Zionists and colonialists have found their defeated dreams of 
entrenching their occupation of Palestine. 
  Concluding his statement, the NPPF secretary general 
stressed 
the support of Iraq, the NPPF parties, and the Iraqi people, 
under the leadership of President Saddam Husayn for the 
Palestinian Arab people's struggle to restore their national 
inalienable rights in their homeland.

  [Text] Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the 
Popular Arab Forces Conference, has condemned the abominable 
crime perpetrated by a gang of Zionist settlers this morning 
against Palestinian Muslims at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, he said this repulsive 
crime exemplifies the hatred felt by Zionists toward our 
Palestinian Arab people and confirms the impossibility of 
cohabitation with the invaders and killers who usurped Arab land 
and honor. He called for the intensification of the intifadah 
as the correct response to Zionist crimes and violations of 
Palestinian human rights. Hammudi urged dynamic Arab forces and 
the international community to condemn this appalling massacre 
and its imperialist backers, especially the U.S. Administration 
-- the Zionist entity's strategic ally. The blood of innocent 
martyrs is an offering for the redemption of Palestine from the 
abomination of the racist, hateful Zionist occupation, Hammudi 
said.

  [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA)--Iraqi newspapers today 
stressed that the Zionists' crime in Hebron will continue to be 
a disgrace to the Zionist entity, America, and all the dwarfs of 
those who betray their people and nation. Victory is always for 
the people. 
  In their editorials, the papers denounced the heinous 
Zionist 
crime which was perpetrated by the fascist Zionists against 
Muslim worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city 
of Hebron yesterday, Friday. The papers said that the dreadful 
Hebron massacre shows the treacherous fascist nature of the 
Zionist Movement and its plotting against the Arab nation and 
the Palestinian Arab people's entity. 
  The newspaper AL-QADISIYAH calls on the Arab and Muslim 
masses to rise up against the agent regimes, the Zionist entity, 
and all those who perpetrated and supported the Zionists' crime 
in Hebron, which defied the feelings of the Arabs and Muslims in 
their most sacred holy places and rites. 
  In its editorial under the headline "A Condemned Abominable 
Zionist Crime," the paper says: This criminal act proves that 
the Zionists are thirsty for the blood of Muslims and Arabs, and 
that they have always been seeking to kill and persecute them 
and to confiscate their right in Arab Palestine. 
  AL-QADISIYAH stresses that the Zionists and their masters 
must know that this brutal crime and similar despicable hostile 
acts perpetrated against Muslims in the occupied Arab 
territories will only strengthen their resolve, escalate their 
valiant intifadah against the repression of the Zionist entity, 
and will clearly expose those who are desperate for a settlement 
and those who pant after the mirage of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement. 
  The paper says: The odious Hebron massacre has exposed the 
treacherous fascist nature of the Zionist Movement and its 
plotting against the Arab nation and the Palestinian people's 
entity. It reminds us of the Zionists' massacres in Dayr Yasin, 
Bahr al-Baqar, Abu Za'bal, and elsewhere. 
  The paper explains that this dreadful Zionist crime proves 
the Zionist entity's insistence on ignoring the feelings of all 
Arabs and Muslims, confiscating the Palestinian Arab land, and 
annihilating the Palestinian people in a way that exposes Arab 
regimes that are linked with the foreigner as well as those who 
are desperately panting after capitulatory solutions of the 
settlement Arabs. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper says: The sons of 
Palestine are now bolstering their unity with the trench of the 
eternal Mother of Battles. At the same time, the facts of the 
Mother of Battles have clearly showed Iraq's ability to stand 
fast in the face of the Zionist-Atlantic-U.S. satan and its 
local agents and traitors. Iraq's steadfastness in the eternal 
Mother of Battles and the Palestinian people's intifadah will 
continue to be the torch which will dissipate Arab darkness and 
lead to the Arab nation's historic awakening. 
  The newspaper AL-'IRAQ stresses that what took place at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn on Friday, the 15th of Ramadan, the 
month of worship, faith, fasting, and piety, was a new Zionist 
crime and an abhorrent massacre to be added to the criminal 
enemy's record of ceaseless acts of killing, annihilation, and 
mass liquidation of the sons of the Palestinian people, which it 
has been carrying out since its establishment in Arab Palestine. 
  In its editorial, the paper says: This crime, which was 
perpetrated by the enemies of God and humanity, the murderer 
Zionists, has exposed the true nature of the Zionist enemy and 
its criminal scheme to annihilate the Palestinian people and to 
uproot them from their holy land through escalating the killing 
and pursuing of the Palestinian citizens by the occupation 
forces and settlers who are actually professional military men 
in civilian clothes, and who have been supplied with the same 
weapons used by the regular army personnel. 
  AL-'IRAQ adds: Those who scrutinize the enemy's negotiations 
record and its dirty and twisted methods, beginning with the 
Rhodes negotiations in 1948, passing through the Camp David 
Accords with al-Sadat, and ending with the series of meetings 
which were held in Norway, Switzerland, France, and Egypt, will 
emerge with one conclusion only; namely, that this treacherous 
fascist enemy does not believe in peace, will not recognize Arab 
rights, and has no intention to withdraw from a single inch of 
Palestine. 
  The paper stresses that the history of the Arab-Zionist 
conflict has proved that one cannot count on any solution no 
matter how capitulatory this person maybe and regardless of 
whether he is responsive to the Zionist avarice or not. This is 
because our enemy, as the statements of its officials show, 
beginning with Moshe Sharit [name as transliterated] and 
Ben-Gurion and ending with Yitzhaq Shamir and Yitzhaq Rabin, is 
simply committed to the Zionist dream. 
  The paper notes that the new crime will not affect the 
official U.S. and European stands, especially since the U.S. and 
Western media, particularly the ill-famed British BBC which, 
from the very beginning of the massacre, tried to play down the 
true number of martyrs and wounded, and to show that what has 
happened was only the the act of an individual Zionist settler. 
  Concluding its article, the paper stresses: We are very 
confident and certain that this odious massacre will only 
strengthen the determination of our brothers in the occupied 
territories to adhere to their sacred land and rights. We are 
facing a criminal usurper enemy which only understands the 
language of force, fateful confrontation, and challenge until 
final victory is achieved and until its evil and expansionist 
schemes are defeated after we retaliate for all the galaxies of 
martyrs on the road of struggle, and intifadah for the sake of 
maintaining Palestine's Arab identity. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH calls on the Arabs and Muslims to honestly 
raise their voices and say: Shame on America which is 
sponsoring and committing the Zionist crime and protecting the 
perpetrators. Under the headline: "God is Great: They Are 
Slaughtering Us Collectively in the Name of Human Rights," the 
paper says: America's followers are not satisfied with violating 
honor, demolishing mosques, killing children and starving old 
men. Furthermore, they indiscriminately shoot worshipers in a 
place protected by God. The paper asks: Has this crime shaken 
the consciences of those who shook hands with the people whom 
they themselves once said that any hand extended to those people 
will be chopped? 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: He who wants peace with the Arabs will 
not kill their children, steal their lands and waters, and 
demolish their mosques. Yesterday's crime revealed that the 
peaceful settlement is a lie and a delusion and that walking 
this road is a falsehood. 
  Addressing the U.S. president, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: You well- 
mannered Clinton: You must remember that human beings are the 
same throughout the world, in America and elsewhere. Therefore, 
your reaction is strange if you really believe in what you call 
human rights. How can you invade a country with your country's 
armies to guarantee the freedom of expression, as you say, while 
watching in silence the killing of hundreds, in fact thousands, 
of people with the guns and in accordance with the decisions of 
your army and followers in other countries and in the United 
States? 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-JUMHURIYAH says: We are 
disgusted by your hypocrisy O Americans. The entire world 
despises your slogans and symbols. Are you aware of this, or 
will the cowboy continue with his crimes until he falls in a 
grave which he will dig with his own criminal acts?

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 27, INA--On Friday early morning nearly 
sixty Palestinians had been massacred inside the Hebron mosque 
in al-Khalil City, occupied West Bank while performing their 
prayers. 
  AL-THAWRAH daily for today editorialised that amidst the sea 
of the Hebron Mosque martyrs, the whole world stands face to 
face before the U.S. law unsheathing its sword at the earth 
nations necks and their rights and dignity. And here is the 
U.N. Security Council, despite the Palestinians Friday carnage 
and others shot dead by Zionist soldiers in punishment for 
expressing their grief on the murdering of their brothers, is 
still holding unofficial consultations and waiting for formulae 
that would renew confidence in Israel's government and its 
ability to tackle the situation "in justice and wisdom". 
  One would wonder, the daily editorial maintains, had this 
crime been perpetrated by a party other than the Zionist entity, 
were he to hear similar to this U.S. diplomacy characterised by 
calmness, or witness speedy international resolutions and 
military concentrations, let alone pressures and land, air and 
sea political and economic sanctions.

  [Text] Baghdad, Feb 28, INA--Iraqi press maintained today 
condemning and denouncing the Zionist unsightly crime of 
massacring the Palestinians performing their prayers inside 
Hebron Mosque on Friday claiming tens of lives and injuring 
other scores. 
  AL-THAWRAH daily article says the essential fact, the 
Americans and their allies and agents do not want to 
acknowledge, is that the people of Palestine who are for more 
than forty years waging unremitting struggle and offering dear 
sacrifices against encountering Zionist suppression and 
occupation, would not be weakened and their determination would 
not relax in confronting terrorism and oppression. 
  The Palestinians would rather continue their strife and 
sacrifices till they achieve restoration of their homeland and 
right to life, freedom and dignity and establishment of their 
independent state on their national soil. 
  The daily says if the Hebron Mosque massacre has once again 
embodied the criminal fascist essence of the Zionist entity and 
demonstrated their thirst for Palestinian blood, the U.S. 
attitude towards this crime discloses again its unmasked bias to 
the Zionist entity and emphasises its keeness on providing 
political protection for the Zionist entity at the international 
organization, apart from relevant media pretexts and covers. 
  AL-THAWRAH daily article has further added that as it is 
used 
to in dealing with the Zionist entity crimes being perpetrated 
against the Palestinian people, the United States has been for 
some days pursuing efforts, politically and in media not only 
for containing and absorbing angry reactions to the crime, 
[words indistinct] 
  At any rate, says the daily, this U.S. attitude is not the 
first of its kind and would not be the last. It is rather an 
extension to a chain of U.S. stands of bias to the Zionist enemy. 
  As for AL-QADISIYAH daily it has said that what took place 
at 
the Hebron mosque on Friday morning has been an expected act and 
represented the foundation on which the Zionist entity has been 
established since their criminal organisations were founded in 
the early of this century. 
  The daily concluded that the settlement negotiations with 
the 
Arabs were not stemming from conviction but rather the product 
of the policy of imposing the accomplished fact, the [word 
indistict] diplomatic apparatus had been pursuing since the time 
of Kissinger in order to drive the Arab parties to the 
negotiating table.

  [Text] Baghdad, 28 Feb (INA)--In reply to what the British 
BBC and the U.S. NBC television networks have screened about 
alleged flooding in the marshlands, Irrigation Minister Nizar 
Jum'ah al-Qasir has said that the water resources in the Tigris 
and Euphrates rivers this year are lower than the usual average, 
and this does not at all allow releasing large quantities of 
water into the southern region of Iraq. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, he said that more 
than two months ago we began storing water in the dams in the 
upper parts of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers in anticipation 
of a water shortage during the next summer and winter seasons. 
  The minister of irrigation emphasized that Iraq's water 
resources from outside the country, through the Tigris and 
Euphrates rivers, have substantially been reduced as a result of 
the dams constructed by Turkey. 
  It is known that 75 percent of Iraq's water resources come 
from outside the country. 
  The minister said the scenes screened by BBC and NBC show 
floods in the marshland during the Tigris flooding in 1988. The 
objective of showing these scenes within the framework of a 
television program on the marshlands is to mislead public 
opinion in Britain and the United States in the course of a 
misinformation campaign about Iraq. Sometimes they say the Iraqi 
Government is draining the marshlands, now they are saying the 
Iraqi Government is flooding the marshlands at a time when Iraq 
is suffering from a water shortage. This only indicates the 
failure and confusion of the U.S. and British quarters in their 
hostile campaigns against Iraq.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified "official spokesman" -- read by </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] The Syrian public opinion was shocked to hear the 
news of the horrible massacre which was committed by armed 
Israeli elements against Palestinian worshipers inside Hebron's 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today in which dozens were martyred 
and hundreds injured. 
  This outrageous act, which reminds the Arabs and Muslims of 
the Dayr Yasin Massacre in 1948, emphasizes to the whole world 
the extreme seriousness of the continuing Israeli occupation of 
the territories and settling in it in contravention of all laws 
and statutes and as a flagrant challenge to the UN resolutions 
and Charter. 
  It has become clear to the entire international community 
that Israel's intransigent stands, expansionist aims, and the 
policies of evasion and procrastination which it has been 
following in the peace talks for more than two years are the 
primary cause of the acts of violence in the occupied Arab 
territories. Israel is responsible, directly or indirectly, for 
extremism in the region. 
  Syria, which is aware that the whole world deplores this 
savage massacre, is well aware that words of denunciation and 
condemnation are not enough to end the circles of violence and 
terror, and that an end to the Israeli occupation without 
further procrastination and stalling within the framework of the 
current peace talks [fi itari muhadathat al-salam al-jariyah] 
and allowing the Palestinian people to acquire their right of 
self-determination will ensure ending extremism and acts of 
violence and realizing just and comprehensive peace in the 
region.

  [Excerpt] A general strike was observed in all Palestinian 
camps in Syria to protest the bestial massacre perpetrated by 
Zionist settlers against our people in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron. Shops were closed in these camps and black flags 
were raised to mourn the righteous Palestinian martyrs. 
  The factions affiliated with the Alliance of the Palestinian 
Forces in Syria decided to receive condolences for three days, 
as of today, Saturday, in the al-Yarmuk branch of the 
Palestinian Youths. 
  Palestinian popular organizations and masses today staged 
sit-ins at the offices of the International Red Cross, the 
United Nations, the Arab League, and the PLO in Damascus. They 
handed protest memorandums to the representatives of these 
organizations on this terrible massacre. The memorandums urged 
the international organizations and community to move swiftly to 
stop the massacres against the Palestinian people, to carry out 
their duties and safeguard the lives of innocent people, and to 
implement the international resolutions which call for 
protecting people under occupation. The Palestinian 
organizations' memorandums stressed that the new massacre will 
not prevent the Palestinian people from continuing their just 
struggle until they achieve all their objectives. [passage

  [Text] The popular organizations and trade unions in Syria 
have condemned the Israeli massacre perpetrated at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque. They emphasized this massacre was the result 
of an organized, premeditated, and planned act. This is proven 
by the mass killings and acts of violence which continued after 
this terrible massacre at the hands of the Israeli occupation 
troops in several areas of the occupied territories. 
  In a statement issued today, the popular organizations and 
trade unions said this abominable crime is not new to the 
aggressive nature of the Israeli settlers and soldiers. This 
crime was intended to terrorize Arab residents as a prelude to 
evacuating and annexing Arab land as part of the Israeli policy 
of expansion and hegemony. 
  The statement noted Israel's racist rancor and terrorist 
record, which is replete with mass massacres, including the 
massacres of Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar, 
Da'il, and southern Lebanon. The statement added that the 
Hebron massacre confirms the dangers posed by continued Israeli 
occupation of Arab territories and the presence of settlements 
in them. Both the occupation and settlements violate all 
international laws, norms, and resolutions. 
  The statement emphasized that this heinous massacre shows 
that Israel's intransigence and procrastination in the peace 
talks instigate acts of violence. This makes Israel responsible 
for extremism and terrorism in the region. 
  The statement reiterated that the Syrian people, 
organizations, and trade unions support the Palestinian Arab 
people and our kinsfolk in the Golan and southern Lebanon in 
their struggle to liberate every inch of Arab territory and to 
regain the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. 
  The statement added that the popular organizations and trade 
unions -- which were established under the sponsorship and care 
of leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad and which are experienced in 
adherence to rights as their policy and in sticking to 
consistent positions as their principle -- stress that the path 
of capitulation, sellout of rights, and chasing the mirage of 
partial and deceptive solutions cannot produce peace. 
  The statement urged the international community, the 
Security 
Council, and the United Nations to end the policy of double 
standards and assume their humanitarian responsibility to 
confront the logic of Israeli hegemony. It urged these bodies 
to pressure Israel into complying with international legitimacy, 
which specifies the principles of a just and comprehensive peace 
and guarantees security in the region.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has strongly condemned the assault on 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn today in 
which dozens were killed and hundreds wounded. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League is very gravely 
concerned about this sorrowful incident. 
  In a statement to MENA, 'Abd-al-Majid said he issued 
instructions to Ambassador Mahmud Abu-al-Nasr, head of the Arab 
League Bureau in New York, to coordinate with representatives of 
the Islamic Conference Organization, the OAU, and the Arab 
countries at the United Nations to submit the issue to the 
Security Council to decide what to do about this assault and to 
draw the world's attention to it via the Security Council, the 
highest international body. 
  The Arab League secretary general added that this act proves 
again that the settlers flout security and public order in the 
occupied territories while the Israeli authorities overlook 
their crimes. He pointed out that this situation causes things 
to escalate dangerously and threatens the peace process. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Israeli Government must 
immediately adopt measures to protect the Palestinians from such 
hostile acts and that the world community must bear its 
responsibility and provide international protection for the 
Palestinians living under occupation. He remarked that this is 
necessary because Israel is unable to maintain order in those 
areas in line with international agreements and the Human Rights 
Charter. 
  'Abd-al-Majid stressed the importance of adopting measures 
to 
prevent a recurrence of these hostile actions.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has described the resolutions 
adopted by the emergency meeting of the Arab League Council last 
night as all-encompassing and comprehensive, revealing a united 
Arab stance that is rallying to condemn last Friday's ugly 
massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied West 
Bank. 
  In statements today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League 
Council resolutions are a message from the Arab League to Israel 
and the international community, clarifying that prevarication, 
procrastination, and Israel's nonrespect for the dates agreed 
upon have become unacceptable in the Arab world. 
  He stressed that the Arab countries are seeking to achieve a 
comprehensive and just peace to create stability in the Middle 
East. He noted that peace is not only an Arab interest, but an 
Israeli one too. He said the Arabs want a just peace based on 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories in accordance 
with the resolutions of international legitimacy and based on 
recognition of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Hebron massacre 
again highlighted the Arab stance that demands Israel's 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, stressing that 
the Arab countries are not in a weak position, because justice 
is on their side. 
  He noted that the Palestinian intifadah activated the recent 
peace process and hastened the Madrid conference and the 
Washington peace talks. 
  The Arab League secretary general also stressed the 
importance of the Jerusalem issue. He said it has top priority 
in the negotiations and the Palestinian and Arab sides are 
determined to retrieve it. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--Arab League Assistant 
Secretary General 'Adnan 'Imran has stated that the world 
reactions to the massacre of Palestinian worshipers in the 
Hebron Mosque on Friday are not enough. He pointed out that the 
world community has gotten used to Israeli massacres. 
  Ambassador 'Imran noted that this is not the first and will 
not be the last massacre unless real international deterrent 
measures are taken. He pointed out that the Israeli settlement 
policy defies the Geneva Conventions and the UN Security Council 
resolutions. He added that this policy was not made by settlers 
but by the Israeli governments, which set up these settlements, 
are responsible for arming the settlers to seize Arab 
territories, and permitted them to use their weapons at their 
personal discretion. This, he added, shows that the Israeli 
authorities are responsible for writing the scenario of the 
massacre.

  [Text] Riyadh, 26 Feb, SPA -- The General Secretariat of 
the GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] has strongly denounced the 
savage bloody massacre perpetrated yesterday [25 February] at 
dawn by Israeli settlers against Palestinian citizens while the 
latter were performing the dawn prayers in the al-Ibrahimi 
mosque in the Palestinian town of al-Khalil, and the result of 
this hideous crime -- the martyrdom of scores of innocent 
citizens and the injuring of hundreds of others. 
  A statement issued by the general secretariat of the council 
today condemned the criminal aggression, and stressed that it 
expressed Israeli extremism and bigotry, and carelessness for 
the lives of Palestinian citizens. The statement urged the 
international community to bear its responsibilities in 
providing protection for the Palestinians in the occupied 
Palestinian territories, stopping the crime and bloody slaughter 
committed against them, and blaming the Israeli Government alone 
for any results of this criminal aggression. 
  For its part, the General Secretariat of the organization of 
the Arab Red Crescent and Red Cross societies has condemned the 
regrettable incidents that took place yesterday in the 
al-Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil, and stressed that these 
criminal acts perpetrated by the Jewish settlers violated the 
freedom of the sacred places and of innocent citizens. 
  In a statement issued today, the general secretariat called 
for the disarming of the settlers so that such hideous crimes 
may not be repeated against the innocent sons of the Palestinian 
people, which is struggling to gain its legitimate rights.

<F P=106> [Hisham Milhim dispatch from Washington] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Governments of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan 
have decided to suspend bilateral peace negotiations with Israel 
in Washington before the end of the last week of talks on 
Wednesday. This decision is to put on record their vehement 
denunciation of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and to express 
their solidarity with the Palestinian people. 
  Syrian delegation head Muwaffaq al-'Allaf communicated this 
united Arab stand to peace negotiations coordinator Dennis Ross 
on Sunday afternoon. 
  Al-'Allaf told Radio Monte Carlo: In light of the 
circumstances resulting from the massacre, we found that it is 
not logical or suitable to pursue the negotiations. We also 
want to express our solidarity with the Palestinian people after 
this barbaric attack. 
  The suspension of negotiations takes place three days before 
they were scheduled to end. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The peace negotiations in Washington have been 
broken off and will apparently not he resumed before April. 
Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian delegation, informed 
U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross of the decision reached by 
the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese delegations. He pointed out 
that the decision had been personally made by the 
representatives of the various Arab delegations. 
  Israeli sources expressed the assessment that this was an 
indication of the desire of Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan not to 
exacerbate the tensions generated by the Hebron massacre. 
  Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington told 
our 
correspondent Arye Golan that Israel was prepared to launch 
continuous negotiations with the Palestinians in Washington 
starting this Wednesday [2 March], as proposed by President 
Clinton; however, this was now up to the PLO. 
  Political sources in Jerusalem expressed regret at the break 
in the talks, noting that this was merely a temporary hiatus 
which did not mean that the peace process had been halted. 
  The resumption of the Security Council's debate on the 
Hebron 
massacre has been put off due to the PLO's demand to include 
Jerusalem in the resolution calling for guarantees for the 
security of the Palestinians in the territories. Israel is 
prepared to accept this formula but refuses to include Jerusalem 
in it. Israel has also rejected the PLO demand to include a 
clause on a temporary international presence in the territories. 
  Gad Ya'aqobi, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, 
said 
that the international presence stipulated in the Declaration of 
Principles signed between the PLO and Israel referred to foreign 
observers that would be deployed with the mutual consent of both 
parties during the Israeli withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. The Security Council is not convening because of the 
disagreement over these two issues. For the time being, 
agreement has only been reached on issuing a condemnation of the 
Hebron massacre and a call for accelerated peace negotiations. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 28 February 
reports that "political sources in Jerusalem believe that the 
United States will take action to resume the peace talks after 
the Security Council issues its resolutions. Yesterday, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin received a letter from UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus- Ghali. The secretary general called on 
Israel to agree to an international or foreign presence in the 
territories as stipulated by the Declaration of Principles 
signed in Oslo, although that document mentions the issue from a 
different aspect. Butrus-Ghali justifies his position by saying 
that stationing an international presence in the territories 
would constitute a confidence building measure between Israel 
and the Palestinians. Officials in Jerusalem, however, have 
categorically rejected this demand. Jerusalem officials also 
clarified that no additional decisions would be taken beyond 
those made by the cabinet yesterday."]

  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, has stated that following the ugly Israeli massacre in 
the holy Ibrahimi Mosque during Friday's dawn prayers, the Arab 
parties participating in the current bilateral negotiations in 
Washington held intensive contacts with one another and with the 
heads of their delegations to the negotiations and decided not 
to attend the remaining meetings in these negotiations. 
  A senior PLO official said today that the peace talks with 
Israel have been suspended and no decision to resume them in 
Washington or elsewhere has been made. PLO Executive Committee 
member Samir Ghawshah said after a Palestinian leadership 
meeting last night that the Palestinian side has recalled all 
its negotiating teams. He added that, in his opinion, the talks 
have been suspended. 
  Another PLO official today said the PLO decided to send a 
special envoy to Washington within 24 hours for talks with the 
American officials on the terms for resuming the peace talks 
with Israel. He said the PLO agreed in principle to resume 
talks, but this does not mean they will be held next week.

  [Text] United Nations, February 25 (AFP)--UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali sharply condemned the Hebron 
massacre of 53 Palestinians Friday and called on Israel to 
prevent Jewish settlers from committing other criminal acts. 
  Butrus-Ghali, in an official statement released here in New 
York, expressed deep concern over the attack in the West Bank 
town of Hebron and the effect it might have on the Middle East 
peace process. 
  He called for calm by all sides in the negotiations and the 
immediate implementation of the Declaration of Principles for 
Palestinian autonomy hammered out in Middle East peace talks. 
  Earlier, Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
representative Nasir al-Qidwah said the Security Council will 
likely call an emergency meeting Friday on the Hebron massacre. 
  Asked whether the council would meet on Friday, al-Qidwah 
said, "yes, probably in the afternoon. I guess we will have it." 
  Asked what outcome he hoped to get from the meeting, he said 
"I prefer not to get into that at this stage." 
  The call for the emergency Security Council session came 
hours after one or more Jewish settlers shot dead 53 
Palestinians and wounded 80 during dawn prayers at a Hebron 
mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the PLO delegation </F>
in Washington, by Elimelekh Ram; place and date not given -- 
recorded, in English] 
  [Text] ['Urayqat] What happened in Hebron meant to all 
participants that the issue of settlements will either make or 
break this peace process. So any negotiations, in my opinion, 
that doesn't have the settlements on the top of the agenda will 
be senseless negotiations. 
  [Ram] In other words, Mr. 'Urayqat, you suggest to open the 
DOP [Declaration of Principles] and the Cairo agreements. 
  ['Urayqat] What I am saying is very clear. What I am saying 
is that the crimes, the massacres of Hebron have demonstrated to 
those in the Israeli Government who insisted to have the 
settlement issue delayed -- it has proven them wrong. If they 
want peace, real peace, it means this issue must be on the 
agenda. 
  [Ram] Okay, Sir, so I repeat my question: You mean to open 
the agreement, the DOP and the Cairo agreement? 
  ['Urayqat] Yes.

<F P=106> [by Rene Slama] </F>
  [Excerpts] United Nations, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Disagreement 
between the United States and the Palestinians blocked the 
adoption of a resolution Saturday condemning the massacre of at 
least 52 Palestinians worshiping at a West Bank mosque. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) representative 
at 
the United States, Nasir Al-Qudwah, indicated that talks 
scheduled for Washington this week could collapse if the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] did not adopt a resolution condemning 
the killings and if Israel did not take steps to protect 
Palestinians from Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. 
  The United States, which is in constant contact with Israel, 
has agreed to go further than just condemning the assault but 
rejected any reference to Jerusalem as an occupied territory or 
offering international protection for Palestinians, a PLO 
representative said. [passage omitted] 
  "We believe that it is very unfortunate that the Council 
failed to fulfill its responsibility," said al-Qudwah, a nephew 
of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. "We reached a deadlock." 
  Asked if the Mideast talks scheduled for this week were 
threatened by the failure to agree on resolution, al-Qudwah 
responded: "We appreciate the efforts of President Bill Clinton 
to save the peace process. 
  "But to resume the talks and (for) success to be achieved, 
certain measures should be taken by the Security Council as the 
representative of the international community and by the Israeli 
government." 
  The PLO required a "serious change in policy" from Israel, 
which should start disarming settlers, he said. 
  Also Saturday, UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent 
a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin proposing that 
the United Nations send observers to the occupied territories, a 
spokesman for the secretary general said.

  [Text] Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the PLO 
has sent the Israeli Government a series of questions about 
matters of principle. Israel's replies to these queries would 
help the organization decide its position regarding the 
continuation of the peace negotiations. The list of questions 
was handed to Major General Dani Rothschild by Palestinian 
delegate Sa'ib 'Urayqat. The questions deal with the 
confiscation of the settlers' weapons, the evacuation of the 
settlement of Netzarim in the Gaza Strip, and the stationing of 
an international force in the territories. 
  At today's cabinet session, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
said that Israel could meet the Palestinian demands on certain 
issues; however, other demands, such as the stationing of an 
international force in the territories, would be rejected.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>
  [Excerpt] This past week in Cairo, Yo'el Singer, the 
Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, and Nabil Sha'th, the head of 
the Palestinian delegation to the security committee talks, 
completed the formulation of approximately half of the overall 
agreement for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and 
settled the serious dispute over the Palestinians' legislative 
powers. In Singer's opinion, the meeting between Rabin and 
'Arafat and the signing of the agreement between Israel and the 
PLO could take place before 13 April 1994. 
  Nevertheless, in a special interview with DAVAR, Singer 
noted 
that Israel says that the mass release of prisoners is 
conditional on a general amnesty of collaborators. According to 
him, the PLO made a strategic decision to advance rapidly in all 
tracks of the talks. The talks in Cairo in the last two weeks 
have been very businesslike and good, Singer said. Issues which 
were previously settled only after arguments that lasted for 
days have recently been settled within half an hour, he said.

  [Text] As soon as it received word about the criminal 
incident against innocent, defenseless Palestinian citizens in 
the holy Ibrahimi mosque at dawn today, the Jordanian Government 
held intensive contacts with Arab, Islamic, and friendly states, 
and with international organizations, to express its strong 
denunciation and condemnation of this incident. In its 
contacts, the Jordanian Government held Israel responsible for 
the incident and its consequences. It urged the international 
community to assume its responsibilities toward putting an end 
to such acts that desecrate holy places, terrorize secure 
citizens, and escalate violence. 
  In this context, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for 
foreign affairs, summoned separately the ambassadors of the UN 
permanent member states -- the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France, China, and Russia -- the ambassador of Greece, 
in its capacity as the current chairman of the European Union, 
and the ambassador of Indonesia, the current chairman of the 
Nonaligned Movement, to his office in the Foreign Ministry. He 
conveyed to them the Jordanian Government's condemnation and 
denunciation of this criminal incident against innocent, 
defenseless worshipers and the violation of the sanctity of holy 
places. The Jordanian Government held Israel fully responsible 
for this massacre and urged it to conduct an immediate 
investigation, since it provides for the settlers' weapons, 
freedom of movement, and access to holy places.

  [Text] On the directives of His Majesty King Husayn, the 
Council of Ministers held an extraordinary session yesterday 
evening to examine the dimensions of the terrible crime 
perpetrated by the Israeli settlers at dawn yesterday against 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron. 
  The prime minister reviewed all dimensions of the criminal 
act and the Arab, Islamic, and international reactions as well 
as the impact of this incident on the peace process. He also 
reviewed the measures adopted by the Jordanian Government on the 
local, Arab, and international levels in view of the magnitude 
of the tragedy in the Ibrahimi Mosque, indicating that this 
incident conflicts with all human, religious, spiritual, and 
ethical values. Dr. al-Majali explained the urgent contacts the 
Jordanian Government held with all concerned parties. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs briefed the 
Council 
of Ministers on his summoning of the ambassadors of the Security 
Council permanent member states and the Greek and Indonesian 
ambassadors in their capacity as chairmen of the EEC and the 
Nonaligned Movement respectively. He communicated to the envoys 
the Jordanian Government's denunciation of this ugly inhuman 
crime and demanded their countries shoulder their responsibility 
toward protecting the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab 
territories, providing security to them, and forcing Israel to 
abide by the UN resolutions, withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories, and dismantle the Israeli settlements as guarantees 
for the continuation of the peace process and the establishment 
of a just, permanent, and comprehensive peace as aspired by the 
peoples of the region. 
  The Council of Ministers announced a three-day mourning in 
the kingdom in condemnation of the ugly crime. Flags will fly 
at half mast over the ministries and both the official and 
popular departments. The government decided to suspend work 
today for two hours from 1200 to 1400 in solidarity with the 
Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. The 
Council of Ministers also decided to offer donations to the 
martyrs' families to alleviate their suffering as a show of 
solidarity with them at this sorrowful time. The ministers also 
decided to make personal donations. 
  The Council of Ministers decided to form a higher national 
committee to supervise the collection of donations to the 
martyrs' families and the wounded. It will be chaired by the 
Chief Justice and consist of the secretary general of the Awqaf 
and Islamic Affairs Ministry, the secretary general of the 
Social Development Ministry, the director general of the 
Palestinian Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, the 
chairman of the Welfare Societies Union, a representative from 
the Chamber of Commerce, and another from the Chamber of 
Industry. It was also decided to form committees to collect 
donations in all Jordanian governorates. These will be chaired 
by the administrative officers. Medical aid and urgent 
assistance will be extended to the wounded. Medicine and 
medical supplies will be sent to all West Bank hospitals. The 
Council also decided to pursue contacts with sisterly and 
friendly states in order to adopt the necessary measures to 
prevent the recurrence of such ugly crimes and intensify 
diplomatic efforts to guarantee the Israeli withdrawal so that 
the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights on 
their soil and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. 
  At the conclusion of its session, the Council of Ministers 
issued the following statement: 
  The Council of Ministers became acquainted with the news of 
the Jewish settlers' sinful criminal attack on defenseless 
worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the dawn 
prayers--an attack which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of 
a large number of worshipers. The Council of Ministers 
expresses its profound denunciation and vehement condemnation of 
this terrible massacre. This massacre, unprecedented in 
savageness, targeted the innocent worshipers in this blessed 
month and in one of the holiest shrines. It was a continuation 
of a chain of inhuman attacks and violations targeting the 
Palestinian people. Jordan has long warned against the grave 
consequences of such attacks and violations on security, 
stability, and the peace process. 
  Israel must bear full responsibility for this action, put an 
end to all kinds and forms of terrorist acts, particularly those 
perpetrated by the Jewish settlers, disarm the settlers, remove 
settlements, and secure the protection of Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. The Council of Ministers also appeals to 
the international community and both world and humanitarian 
bodies to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent such 
incidents by guaranteeing the protection of the Palestinian 
people, securing their legitimate rights, and seeking a just and 
comprehensive settlement that ends the conflict and guarantees 
Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab 
territories, headed by holy Jerusalem. 
  The Council of Ministers, while extending deepest sympathy 
and condolences to the patient and steadfast kinsfolk and 
brothers in Hebron and the occupied territories and to the 
martyrs' families, stresses the solidarity of Jordan--king, 
government, and people-- with them in confronting such measures 
and violations. It stresses that it stands by their side in 
their just and legitimate struggle. The occurrence of such 
incidents requires us to unify efforts, close ranks, overcome 
Arab differences, and realize a unified Arab position based on 
pan-Arab constants and capable of advancing the peace process in 
order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will return 
rights to their owners and that is acceptable to future 
generations. 
  The Council of Ministers, while addressing the sons of the 
one Jordanian family, who were distressed by this serious 
incident, hopes that this will be an occasion for further 
cohesion and national unity in order to confront challenges and 
deal with them with wisdom, reflection, and reason.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Political and community leaders reacted 
vehemently Friday [25 February] to the massacre of over at least 
60 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and called on 
Jordanians to observe three days of mourning and calling for an 
end to peace negotiations with Israel on all fronts. 
  "We call on all Jordanians to let black flags fly over their 
homes for three days and to abstain from working for a symbolic 
1/4 of an hour Saturday in commemoration of the martyrs," read 
the announcement distributed by the professional associations 
and leftist, pan-Arab and Islamist political parties. The 
groups announced that a march would be held Suunday at 14:40 
from the professional unions building to the al-Hashimiyah 
Square in downtown Amman to mark "the anger in our hearts and 
our rejection of the peace process as it stands." 
  Leaders of political parties, popular unions and 
organisations as well as members of Parliament and Palestinian 
activists met Friday to declare their outrage at the massacre in 
a heated atmosphere which brought tears to the eyes of many and 
would-be fistifights on several occasions. 
  Less than an hour after news of the attack was broadcast. 
representatives and members of Jordanian and Palestinian popular 
unions and organisations marched from the professional 
associations complex in al-Shmaysani to the Red Cross office 
asking for international protection for Palestinians living 
under Israeli occupation. 
  Almost simultaneously after the noon prayers demonstrations 
broke out in several Palestinian refugee camps in greater Amman 
and al- Baq'ah. 
  In the al-Baq'ah refugee camp, Lower Houser member Muhammad 
'Uwaydah and Islamic Action Front representative Muhammad 
Abu-Faris joined demonstrators in condemning the attack and 
calling for an end to the peace process. 
  But the IAF was not the only group to call for an obrogation 
of the peace process. 
  Wahid al-Ja'bari, president of the Khalil al-Rahman society, 
also known as the Hebron Community Society, called on Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to "resign 
immediately." There should be an immediate vote of no 
confidence for Yasir 'Arafat and anyone involved in the peace 
negotiations." Mr. al-Ja'bari told fellow Hebronites gathered at 
the society in a massive condolence ceremony for the relatives 
of the victims of the massacre. 
  Mr. al-Ja'bari, a Hebron notable known for his close ties to 
the Jordanian government rather than the PLO leadership, said 
"all Palestinians should withdraw from the negotiations." 
  Mr. al-Ja'bari headed rows of Hebronites receiving 
condolences from Jordanian government officials, foreign 
diplomats as well as political party heads and leaders of 
popular organisations, union and professional association heads. 
  Lower House of Parliament Speaker Tahir al-Masri visited the 
society shortly after news of the massacre spread through Amman. 
"The speaker gave us his condolences and expressed his outrage 
at the massacre." Mr. al-Ja'bari said. 
  But not all visits by officials to the Khalil al-Rahman 
Society were well received. Leading members of the PLO such as 
'Abbas Zaki, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council 
Salim al-Za'nun and FIDA representative in Amman Salih Ra'fat 
were booed and Mr. Ra'fat was physically attacked during his 
visit. 
  The three Palestinian officials were not held welcome 
because 
they represent the negotiators who are responsible for the 
massacre. said one Hebronite. the three were rushed out of the 
society under protection. 
  The attack on Mr. Ra'fat came after Lower House Member 
Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-Zant called for the "liquidation of the PLO 
and the establishment of an Islamic leadership for the 
Palestinian people." 
  A member of the Palestine Central Council, Mr. Ra'fat stood 
up calling for "national unity in this time of mourning." A 
member of the audience subsequently "got up and rushed towards 
Mr. Ra'fat attempting to throw him on the ground," one observer 
told the Jordan Times. 
  The attacker was taken away by other members of the audience 
and expelled from the main hall of the society. 
  Nominal head of the IAF 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah brought many 
members of the audience to tears with an eloquent speech in 
which he referred to historic Muslim rights in Hebron and the 
"humiliation of the all Muslims on this day." 
  "As our brethren kneeled at dawn to pray, they becaome 
martyrs and we must join them in their jihad to regain the Bayt 
al-Maqdis," said Shaykh Khalifah. 
  "It is our jihad against the "world Zionist conspiracy lead 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton," said Mr. Khalifah. 
  "This proves once and for all that the peace negotiations 
are 
dead," added head of the IAF Executive Committee Ishaq al-Farhan. 
  Amman based Hamas officials Ibrahim Ghawshah and political 
bureau members Musa Abu-Marzuq addressed audiences in the Khalil 
al-Rahman Society and in the professional Associations complex. 
  But not all Palestinian parties which have operating offices 
in Jordan blamed Friday's massacre on the PLO and the 
negotiations. The Palestine People's Party, one of the three 
party's along with the mainstream Fatah and FIDA to participate 
in the peace talks, put the blame for the massacre firmly in the 
Israeli camp. 
  "We hold the Israel government and security forces 
responsible for Friday's massacre," said a statement by the 
party. 
  The group called on a halt to negotiations till "settlers 
are 
disarmed and international protection is provided for 
Palestinians under occupation. [no closing quotation marks as 
published] 
  Participants in a meeting held at the professional 
Associations complext called for the donation of one day's wages 
to the families of persons killed or wounded in the massacre and 
urged the organisation of a blood donation drive for the wounded. 
  The participants, who included representatives of political 
and private organisations, also called for the secondment of a 
medical delegation to the occupied territories to offer medical 
assistance to the wounded and called for discussing the prospect 
of bringing to Jordan wounded Palestinians to receive treatment 
in Jordan.

  [Text] The Senate held an extraordinary session today under 
the chairmanship of Ahmad al-Lawzi. During the session, Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed the Senate on the 
government contacts on the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli 
settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque yesterday. The Senate then 
issued a statement condemning the ugly crime. 
  [Begin al-Majali recording] In the name of God, the 
merciful, 
the compassionate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Brother members of 
the honorable Senate: I would like to stress the feelings of the 
government, which fully supports all that was said in this 
honorable Senate this morning. We want to inform the Senate that 
denunciation--and I think this happens for the first time in the 
history of this cause--has come from all parties: The European 
and American parties and even the Israeli leadership regardless 
of whether this Israeli denunciation is a fact or a cover. But 
this is the first time such a denunciation occurs in the manner 
we all have heard. It is natural that upon the directives of 
his majesty the king, contacts were held on the Arab, Islamic, 
and international levels and the third world states. The 
ambassadors were summoned and informed of the importance and 
seriousness of this incident and its impact on the entire peace 
process. The crime is unprecedented in history. It was killing 
in cold blood, not killing in which there was resistance. They 
were in the mosque praying. Therefore, this takes a world 
dimension. We should act on the information, press, and 
diplomatic levels so that this fact reaches all western minds 
continuously and persistently in order to be greatly influential. 
  We were informed that the Americans are taking this issue 
very seriously and they denounce it. Hence, they supported an 
old request made by Jordan to hold the negotiations in one place 
and to hold them continuously until results are achieved. I 
think the U.S. President's call on Israel and the president of 
the Palestinian state to send all delegations to Washington is 
meant to discuss this matter very seriously. We hope this is so. 
  On this occasion, we insist that the root cause of these 
terrorist acts and killings is the occupation of land and the 
construction of settlements. Therefore, we now insist that the 
settlements, as we insisted in all our negotiations, are the 
obstacle. In all their statements, the United States and the 
West also said that. But they might not have felt the 
seriousness of this issue except after the perpetration of this 
crime yesterday. 
  Moreover, the UN Security Council met. We supported this 
meeting, in which discussions and deliberations are still 
continuing. 
  As for what concerns us here, the government announced an 
official three-day mourning. It set up a fund for donations. 
As you see, members of the Senate are offering their 
contributions. Moreover, the government allocated 100,000 
Jordanian dinars, in addition to His Majesty King Husayn's 
donation of another 100,000 Jordanian dinars. A full campaign 
will be launched in support of our kinsfolk in the occupied 
territories. One of the things from which they suffer is the 
financial aspect. We should not forget this. Unfortunately, 
for a long time our kinsfolk have not had financial support 
adequate to enable them to have at least the basic requirements. 
  Therefore, we hope this support by the Senate will enhance 
this and be able to reach those who need it. The committee [as 
heard] is comprised of both the private and public sectors. The 
government will continue all its measures based on our stands in 
Washington. We told the head of the delegation there to convey 
our full feelings and to observe the situation in order to adopt 
a united stand with the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese 
brothers on the issue of negotiations there. We believe that if 
the Americans commit us and force Israel to sit continuously and 
act in a serious manner, perhaps the harmful incident might help 
in finding a solution or reaching clearly defined measures soon. 
We will keep the Senate informed of any further developments. 
  As for the security situation, about 5,000 people are 
currently staging a march at al-Husayni Mosque. However, it is 
a peaceful march. Community colleges and universities closed 
down. In al- Baq'ah, about 5,000 people staged a march toward 
Suwaylih. Some of them returned, while others are still there. 
There is a march of about 400 people in al-Zarqa'. A march 
staged at 'Azmi al-Mufti camp is over. People at the Jerash 
camp are on their way to hold a prayer for the dead. There are 
small gatherings in various parts of the country. 
  We support all forms of expression. However, we are afraid 
of marches because various elements get involved. As everyone 
knows, those with different views unfortunately take advantage 
of marches to carry out acts of violence that we can do without. 
Let the marches be peaceful and strong and let the support be 
in its right place. 
  The government called on the Arab world to close ranks 
because this will enable us to avoid such an incident and obtain 
our rights. We call for and fully support holding an Arab 
summit. We support your request to hold a meeting of Arab 
parliaments in order to adopt a stand toward this incident. 
  Thank you, sir. [end recording]

  [Text] Amman, 26 Feb (PETRA)--The Senate has vehemently 
condemned the heinous crime carried out by Zionist extremists. 
Hundreds of innocent martyrs and wounded people among Hebron's 
citizens fell victims to this crime at dawn yesterday. 
  The Senate met in an extraordinary session this morning, 
attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and other 
ministers. The session was devoted to discussing the dimensions 
of this crime. 
  Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi said the terrible crime 
perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday -- in which hundreds of 
innocent martyrs and wounded people fell as victims -- makes it 
necessary to draw lessons and explore the results this terrible 
event implies and the dangers and challenges it poses. 
  Al-Lawzi said the extraordinary session is a contribution by 
the Senate to the efforts of his majesty, the homeland's leader 
and the faithful one Jordanian family. This session will allow 
brother senators to exchange views and consultations. They will 
contribute to enhancing Jordan's honest march and national unity 
in view of this barbaric crime, and to consolidating Jordan's 
pan-Arab responsibilities. Jordan has never failed to assume 
these, in terms of supporting the Palestine question and the 
Palestinian people's struggle to regain their rights and achieve 
self-determination on their national soil and secure the 
implementation of international legitimacy in order to realize a 
just and comprehensive peace that ends occupation and removes 
the settlements. 
  The Senate later observed one minute of silence for the 
martyrs. The senators read the opening chapter of the Holy Koran 
for the martyrs' chaste souls.

  [Text] Amman, 26 Feb (PETRA) -- The House of 
Representatives has condemned the massacre during dawn prayers 
at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron yesterday. This took place at 
the extraordinary session the House held this afternoon under 
Speaker Tahir al-Masri, atttended by Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, to discuss the results of the 
reprehensible massacre Zionist extremists carried out against 
defenseless worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  At the start of the session, al-Masri said yesterday's 
incident is a mournful and momentous event. Although what the 
Zionists had perpetrated against the people in Hebron is not the 
first of its kind that the Palestinians and Muslims have 
experienced at the hands of the Zionist aggressors, the manner 
in which it was carried out, in a safe and sacred place, adds to 
the harm done to one's sentiments and makes it stand out as a 
very strange incident. 
  Al-Masri added: If our relatives in the occupied territories 
cannot be safe in their mosques and during their prayers, then 
where can they be safe?

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Excerpt] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament Saturday 
strongly condemned "the ugly massacre committed by the Zionist 
authorities through its settlers" against Palestinian worshipers 
in the Cave of Patriarchs in Hebron on Friday and urged 
international protection for Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  "As it condemns this crime and the conspiracy of the Israeli 
occupation forces with the settlers as well as the conspiracy of 
the hegemonous forces with the occupation, the (House) declares 
that it is time for Arab awakening," the deputies said. 
  "Statements of condemnations will not relieve the nation of 
its duty," the House said in a statement issued hours after the 
end of a special session held to discuss what House Speaker 
Tahir al-Masri called a serious event and a huge massacre. 
  "Statements of condemnations have become abundant and so 
have 
international decisions...but the Zionist enemy continues to 
shed Palestinian blood," the statement said. 
  The House urged the Arab and Muslim nations "to confront the 
aggression, overcome their differences and unify their stands 
because (all Arab countries) are targetted." 
  In the statement, which was drafted by the House's permanent 
office, deputies urged Arab and Muslim countries to move on the 
international level and at the U.N. Security Council to have the 
international community stand up to the "aggression and demand 
that Israel withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and 
provide protection to the Palestinians until the pullout is 
completed." 
  The House called on Arab and international parliaments to 
condemn the continuous Israeli crimes against the Palestinians 
and guarantee their rights, mainly their right to 
self-determination. 
  While expressing appreciation of the immediate steps the 
government took in reaction to the massacre, the deputies urged 
the executive authority to increase its efforts to guarantee 
Arab, Muslim and international support for the Palestinians. 
  During the session, lawmakers said the massacre emphasises 
the necessity of concrete measures to protect Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied territories but differed on how it 
should affect the Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  The 16-member Islamic Action Front (IAF) bloc said the House 
should demand that the government withdraw from the negotiations 
but failed to get a House vote on its bid after other deputies 
argued its constitutionality. 
  The House must call on the government "to abandon the 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations and move towards 
preparing the people to support our armed forces in the coming 
battle of honour," deputy Hamzah Mansur said in a speech on 
behalf of the IAF bloc. 
  "The criminal act has proven the correctness of the position 
of the IAF and other national, pan-Arab and Islamic forces... 
that it is impossible to coexist with the Jewish enemy and that 
(the peace process) consolidates the occupation of our lands and 
holy places," the IAF said. 
  Mr. al-Masri argued against putting the IAF bid to vote on 
the grounds that such an important decision should not be taken 
after a "hasty and superficial discussion," pointing out that 
the session was specifically called to discuss the massacre and 
not the policies of the government. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Gloom, shock and anger hung over Amman 
Saturday as flags flew at half mast, many schoolchidren staged 
sporadic protest marches and a two-hour closure to mourn the 
victims of Friday's Hebron massacre. 
  Jordanians of all backgrounds showed their outrage by taking 
to the streets in one of the most spontaneous public outbursts 
of anger since the Gulf war. In Irbid, al-Salt, al-Baq'ah and 
all over Amman, men, women and children took to the streets 
waving black and green as well as Palestinian flags, shouting 
Islamic slogans and calling for an end to "negotiations with the 
enemy." 
  "No need to speak with those who murder us. Speak their 
language, the language of jihad," said a speaker at the 
al-Husayn Mosque during noon prayers Saturday. 
  Speaking to a crowd of some 2,500 people gathered in the 
downtown square in front of the mosque after marching from 
different districts of Amman, the speakers urged Muslims to 
"return to your faith and become defenders of the faith in 
Palestine as in Bosnia." 
  "The trio that betrayed you," (Israel Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq) 
Rabin, (U.S. President Bill) Clinton and (Palestine leader 
Yasir) 'Arafat must not be allowed to pave the way of our 
future," said one speaker from inside the mosque whose address 
was broadcast through loudspeakers. 
  Police sealed off much of downtown and traffic came to a 
halt 
while the speakers addressed the crowd. 
  A heavy police presence was visible all over the city. 
Embassies, foreign banks and many other international 
organisations, fearing emotional reprisal owing to their foreign 
affiliations, reported a security alert. The day passed without 
incident, however. 
  Numerous Amman groceries, many of them owned by natives of 
Hebron, closed for the entire day to mark the first day after 
the killings. 
  All shops downtown were closed and black flags flew from the 
shutters of many. 
  The crowd at the al-Hashimiyah Square in downtown continued 
their march and converged at the Roman amphitheatre at around 
1:30 p.m. and dispersed soon afterwards. The demonstrations 
were organised by the Islamic Action Front and a group of 
pan-Arab leftist parties. 
  Schoolchidren who were let out of school at 12:00 p.m. began 
demonstrations in their local neighbourhoods. Students at the 
University of Jordan also staged a protest. 
  Groups of 40 to 60 schoolchildren could be seen Saturday in 
various parts of al=Shumaysani, downtown, Jabal al-Taj and 
al-Jawfah, Garden Street and Bayadir Wadi al-Sir as well as the 
al-Baq'ah and al-Wahdat camps raising the Palestinian flag and 
shouting slogans to protest Friday's killings. 
  A group of some 60 students with green arm bands shouting 
"there is no god but God," converged on the closed American 
embassy in 'Abdun ini the morning hours but were turned back by 
American embassy guards and police. It was the first reported 
group of protestors to converge on the embassy, built two years 
ago. The group left no statement and did not identify 
themselves, according to embassy staff. 
  Jordanian papers ran eight column headlines of Friday's 
killing with explicit pictures of the victims. Akhir Khabar, a 
liberal Jordanian daily, ran one of the most stunning headlines 
--"shalom"-- acroos its frontpage along with a blown-up picture 
of a dead man with his mouth open and blood running out. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Saturday vowed to 
step up the armed struggle against Israel and carry out revenge 
attacks for Friday's killings. 
  "Yes to the revolution of the knives," Hamas spokesman 
Muhammad Nazzal told a press conference. 
  The movement called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
to immediately withdraw from the negotiations with Israel. 
  "We call on 'Arafat to withdraw and for the negotiators to 
withdraw immediately," said one head of Hamas in Jordan, Ibrahim 
Ghawshah. "The Palestinian people know who they are and where 
they are," he said of negotiators living in the West Bank and 
Amman. It is clear that the negotiation option is not the 
option of the Palestinian people but a people-less leadership in 
Tunis. 
  "It is a shame that 'Arafat is planning to go to Washington 
with 30 people before the blood of the martyrs has even had the 
chance to dry. It shows his disrepect for the suffering of his 
people," Mr. Ghawshah added. 
  "Rabin is responsible for security and occupation. So this 
is his domain," concluded Mr. Ghawshah. "But the blood of the 
Palestinian people will be avenged."

<F P=106> [By an unidentified JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Nearly 4,000 people marched through the heart 
of Amman Sunday [27 February] rejecting the 28-month-old Middle 
East peace process and calling for the downfall of Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  The peaceful protest was called to express condemnation of 
Friday's massacre of more than 60 Palestinians by one or more 
Jewish settlers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank town of Hebron. 
  But it turned to a highly politicised event to register what 
Islamist and leftist politicians as well as union leaders 
asserted was a popular rejection of any negotiated peace with 
Israel. 
  "No to peace, yes to holy war," shouted the protesters, who 
began their march from the central bus station at al-'Abdali and 
dispersed at the al-Hashimiyah square in downtown Amman after 
brief speeches by leaders of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) and 
leftist organisations as well as heads of professional 
associations. 
  The speakers severely assailed Mr. 'Arafat and his 
peacemaking strategy with Israel and demanded that all Arab 
parties, including Jordan and the PLO, withdraw immediately from 
the peace talks. 
  Police kept a tight watch over the marchers, who included 
around 200 veiled women, but did not interfere. No violent 
incidents were reported. 
  Banners wielded by the protesters, some of them masked and 
others holding aloft the Holy Koran, denounced the massacre and 
said: "No to surrender, no to negotiations," "Revenge, 
revenge," "armed struggle is our only choice," and "no for 
self-rule." 
  The marchers condemned Mr. 'Arafat for accepting the Sept. 
13 
autonomy agreement with Israel and demanded that he be ousted 
from the chairmanship of the PLO. 
  "Yes to the PLO, no to 'Arafat," said the protesters. 
  Addressing the PLO chairman, they chanted: "Your day of 
judgement is coming." 
  It was the latest rally to be held in Amman following the 
Hebron massacre, and was higher in political intensity than any 
other demonstration held since Friday, save another hardline 
protest march held in the al-Baq'ah camp Saturday. 
  Earlier Sunday, a group of about 150 school students marched 
through the Jabal al-Husayn refugee camp to condemn the mosque 
massacre and vowing revenge. 
  The centrist al-Mustaqbal party, led by Sulayman 'Arar, 
issued a statement on Sunday describing the Hebron killings as 
"a Ramadan gift by the Zionists to the Muslim and Arab people." 
  The massacre should serve as a reminder to those who are 
engaged in peace talks with Israel that "there cannot be peace 
and security in the region as the racist state (Israel) exists 
among them." 
  "Retribution in kind, not condemnation and statements, is 
the 
answer to this crime and other crimes committed by the Zionists 
against the Palestinians and Arabs... starting with (the 1948) 
Dayr Yasin massacre and (the 1982 killings at) Sabra and 
Shatilla and the (1968) burning of al-Aqsa Mosque," said the 
statement. 
  Jordan is observing a three-day national mourning that ends 
Tuesday for the victims of the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
and the government is also raising funds to help the families of 
those killed and wounded in the attack.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Interior Ministry has 
said that in the wake of the criminal massacre that took place 
at dawn today at the Ibrahimi Mosque, some marches were staged 
in Amman to protest the heinous crime committed by Israeli 
settlers against pious worshipers in Hebron. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, the source said 
Khalid Husni al-Qurashi attacked (Lon Edwards), a British 
tourist, at the Hashimite Square at noon today and stabbed him 
with a knife. The tourist was immediately rescued. He is now in 
a good condition. The assailant was arrested. 
  The Interior Ministry expresses its understanding of the 
overwhelming feelings that accompanied the grave event that took 
place at the Ibrahimi Mosque today. It, however, urges citizens 
to exercise self-restraint and close ranks so the feelings of 
support for our people in the occupied homeland will not turn 
into irresponsible, instantaneous reactions that harm our 
feelings and our just cause.

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Jordan has raised tens of thousands of dinars to 
support the victims of Friday's [25 February] Hebron Mosque 
massacre. His majesty the king had spearheaded a nationwide 
fundraising campaign and donated 100,000 dinars to support the 
families of the Palestinians killed by the Jewish settler. 
  The government announced a similar donation in addition to 
private donations from cabinet ministers, civil servants, 
deputies, and senators. 
  Three popular fundraising committees reported warm public 
response to calls for helping the victims' families. Amman 
Mayor Mamduh al-'Abbadi, who heads a popular committee helping 
the Palestinians, said it would give 1,000 dinars to each of the 
families of Palestinians killed in the mosque and the ensuing 
violence. He said the committee would also give 300 dinars to 
families of the Palestinians injured in the mosque massacre. 
  Mr. 'Abbadi told REUTERS that the committee offered to treat 
the Palestinian victims at Jordanian hospitals.

<F P=106> ["Issue and Opinion" column: "Israel and U.S. To Blame for </F>
the Bloody Dawn Massacre", by Salamah 'Ukur] 
  [Text] It should be quite obvious now -- both to the 
Palestinians and the whole world -- that cohabitation between 
the Palestinians and Jewish settlers in Gaza and the West Bank 
is unthinkable. Accordingly, there is a need to rethink the 
Oslo, Davos, and Cairo agreements, as well as the Gazaz-Jericho 
accord itself. The proposed phased settlement on the 
Israeli-Palestinian track -- envisaging an interim five-year 
period followed by a final settlement, the outlines of which are 
by no means clear -- also needs to be reexamined. Inevitably, 
then, the Palestinian leadership will have to back out from a 
stage-by-stage settlement that it concluded with Israel under 
U.S. pressure. Having done that, the Palestinian leadership 
will have to push for the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as Resolution 181, which calls 
for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The 
Palestinian leadership has a strong case to advance to the U.S. 
sponsor of the peace process and the international community; 
namely, that the U.S. initiative and the Madrid conference were 
launched on the basis of UN resolutions, the land-for-peace 
formula, and the Palestinian people's national legitimate rights. 
  The international community, including the powerful, 
permanent members of the UN Security Council, are now all too 
aware that Palestinians in the occupied territories are being 
subjected to a genocidal effort. Hence, it is not reasonable to 
act as if nothing has happened and carry on with the 
negotiations with Israel while the physical liquidation of the 
Palestinians continues, especially since there is not a single 
piece of evidence for an Israeli willingness to pull out from 
the entire Gaza Strip and the West Bank and Jerusalem. Nor is 
there any indication that Israel is willing to entertain the 
idea of an independent Palestinian state -- now or in the 
future. All of which is not lost on the Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, who has indicated that he is not pursuing an 
independent Palestinian state, but a confederation with Jordan! 
  That being the case -- in other words, since the Palestinian 
leadership has renounced the right to self-determination and an 
independent state as stipulated by UN resolutions -- why not 
walk out of a sham peace exercise holding no promise of 
fulfilling Palestinian rights? 
  The Palestinian leadership has exhausted its bargaining 
chips 
at the negotiating table with Israel and failed to get anything 
of significance in the way of the national rights of the 
Palestinian people. This is because it did not treat UN 
resolutions, or the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace 
formula as a point of reference. Instead of giving an 
affirmative response to President Clinton's invitation for 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to go to Washington to 
conclude a final deal, which, in any case, can by no means 
advance national, legitimate Palestinian rights, the Palestinian 
leadership might have suspended the talks, or attached 
courageous strings to their resumption. 
  It is worth recalling here Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres' remark that Israel was negotiating with itself and 
dictating terms. 
  I will go so far as to call on the Palestinian leadership to 
withdraw from the peace process if only to keep from bargaining 
away Palestinian rights. I will call on the Palestinian 
leadership to let Jordan and Egypt negotiate the future of the 
West bank and Gaza on its behalf, since the two territories were 
caputured from Jordan and Egypt. The two countries can conduct 
the negotiations on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 
stipulating Israeli withdrawal from all the territories Israel 
conquered in June, 1967. 
  If Israel has an interest in true and comprehensive peace, 
it 
will have to pull out from all occupied Arab territories -- the 
Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and south Lebanon 
-- in compliance with Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  If the United States wants to make a go of its peace 
initiative and see durable peace, security, and stability 
prevail in the region, it will have to talk or coerce Israel 
into complying with the UN resolutions on the basis of which its 
initiative and the Madrid conference were launched. 
  I believe the Palestinian leadership must acknowledge its 
failure to regain Palestinian rights, and then go on to entrust 
this historic and momentous mission to Jordan and Egypt, both of 
which are better positioned to do the job. With the right 
amount of coordination and solidarity, the cordon states -- 
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon -- can regain the occupied 
Arab territories. Subsequently, the Palestinian leadership can 
take the initiative and claim self-determination from Jordan and 
Egypt, and the Palestinian people can exercise their rights 
either by setting up their own independent state, forging 
confederal or federal ties, or entering into an outright merger 
with any of the cordon states. Obviously such a move on the 
part of the Palestinian leadership calls for a rare degree of 
courage. 
  I dare say that such a courageous stand would win the 
support 
of the political and popular circles in the Palestinian, Arab, 
and Islamic communities. Will the Palestinian leadership take 
inspiration from the holy month of Ramadan and summon the 
courage to do the right thing, and thus rob Israel of the chance 
of keeping up its genocidal effort against the Palestinian 
people? 
  The bloody dawn's massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque is a 
meaningful lesson that ought to be learned. 
  The Palestinian leadership and the Arab nation must hold 
Israel and the U.S. Administration responsible for the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and its consequences.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Husayn Calls for a Practical Arab Response </F>
to the Bloody Massacre"] 
  [Excerpts] The real practical response to the bloody dawn 
massacre that was committed in an unprecedented odious manner in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has come from Jordan. 
  The Jordanian leadership and people were not content only to 
condemn and denounce the reprehensible crime, organize protest 
demonstrations, explain its obnoxious hostile and provocative 
designs, and outline the intentions of those behind it but 
accompanied this with concrete practical measures denoting 
maturity, wisdom, and deliberation. His Majesty King Husayn 
donated 100,000 Jordanian dinars. The Government also donated 
100,000 dinars. The Jordanian citizens donated goods and 
medicines, as well as the blood needed for the wounded. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's reply was a national response 
showing a high sense of responsibility, wisdom, and clarity of 
vision. The king called on the Arab leaders to shoulder their 
responsibilities, and to unite their ranks, actions, and stands. 
He also called on them to forget their differences and rise 
above the causes of dispute and estrangement. [passage omitted] 
  In any case, all the people and countries in the world and 
all the international organizations and bodies, including the UN 
Security Council and the United Nations, have come to realize 
that it is impossible to achieve peace in the occupied 
Palestinian territories with the presence of the settlements and 
the Jewish settlers. 
  It has also been proved that the Arab citizens, the Islamic 
holy places, and the Muslim and Christian places of worship 
there need international protection. This requires the dispatch 
of an international peacekeeping force to the occupied Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank to protect their inhabitants and holy 
places. The responsibility for the bloody dawn massacre at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque is borne by Israel and by the United States 
which encourages it to pursue its settlement policy. This 
calls for a united Arab stand to confront all these momentous 
challenges.

<F P=106> ["The Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "This is the </F>
Reply!"] 
  [Text] Having closed our eyes and contemplated an 
appropriate reply to the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron, 
and having heard proposals and talks and read slogans, we 
suggest the following: 
  --The PLO should declare an immediate withdrawal from the 
peace negotiations, cancel its recognition of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, close the Palestinian ranks, gather all 
the small and large factions without exception into one 
framework, and deploy the PLO forces on all Arab borders with 
Palestine. 
  --The Arab regimes participating in the peace process should 
do exactly as the PLO does, close the file of negotiations 
forever, call on the Arab Defense Council to meet, form a 
unified military command, and declare war on Israel. 
  --The oil-producing states, including the Libyan 
Jamahiriyah, 
should cut the supplies to the Western states and turn this Arab 
wealth into a weapon in the battle because the Arab oil is for 
the entire Arab nation. 
  --The Arab states should ignore their differences, close 
their ranks, firmly support the Palestinian people, and view 
their international relations on the basis of the Palestine 
question because it is the Arabs' first and basic cause. 
  --The Arab states should lift the embargo on Iraq and 
compensate it for all the destruction inflicted on it during the 
second Gulf war. Moreover, the movements waging an armed war 
against the current regimes in Algeria and Egypt should halt 
this war and declare a general truce because priority should be 
given to the confrontation with the enemy. 
  --The Islamic states should declare a holy jihad, channel 
their forces and efforts toward the land of mobilization and 
steadfastness [Jordan], and abandon their previous positions, 
taken since Israel was established. 
  --The Russian nationalists and communists should topple the 
regime of Boris Yeltsin and reinstate the former Soviet Union, 
which supported the Arabs and stood against imperialist Western 
ambitions. 
  These are the elements of the real reply to Israel. Perhaps, 
the first and most important element, however, is to unleash the 
freedom of the Arab individual and allow him to have his own 
opinion about his future and that of his homeland -- this will 
be the real reply. 
  Note: Had one-half of these demands been achieved, the State 
of Israel would not have been established in the first place, 
and no one would have dared go to Madrid, Oslo, and other cities.

  [Text] Amman, 27 Feb (PETRA) -- His Majesty King Husayn has 
denounced the ugly criminal incident against peaceful citizens 
who were holding a mass at Sayyidat al-Najat church in Zuq 
Micha'il in Lebanon. 
  In a cable he sent to His Excellency Lebanese President 
Ilyas 
al-Hirawi, his majesty said the victims fell in the church as a 
result of a plan by a criminal mentality that is no different in 
its evil intentions and tendencies than the mentality that 
planned the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Following is 
the text of the cable: 
  Your Excellency Brother Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. 
  May God's peace and mercy be upon you. 
  We received with great sadness and deep sorrow the report on 
the ugly criminal incident represented by an outrageous attack 
on peaceful citizens, who were holding Sunday mass at Sayyidat 
al-Najat church in Zuq Micha'il this morning, and the resulting 
victims from among the people of sisterly Lebanon. Those 
victims fell as a result of a plan by a criminal mentality which 
is no different in its evil intentions and tendencies than the 
mentality that planned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
Friday morning, the victims of which were citizens piously 
performing the dawn prayers to God almighty. 
  As I express to you my sympathies on behalf of myself and 
the 
people and Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, I ask 
God almighty to grant his mercy to the victims' souls. May God 
help you so that you may continue your benevolent march toward 
the advancement and progress of your homeland and toward 
maintaining its security and the future of its generations. May 
God fortify the victims' grieved families with patience. 
  May God's peace and mercy be upon you. 
  Your Brother King Husayn

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Same Party Behind the Two Crimes at the </F>
Ibrahimi Mosque and the Lebanese Church"] 
  [Excerpt] It seems that there is a hostile scheme to drown 
the Arab cordon [al-tawq] states in blood. 
  There is no doubt that Israel and its agents are behind this 
odious scheme. 
  Israel has started to play the tune of sectarianism to sow 
seditions. 
  Israel carried out the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron 
and 
also perpetrated another reprehensible crime at the Lebanese 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
  The timing of these two odious crimes is not a coincidence, 
but is the result of a studied and premeditated plan. In view 
of these crimes which have greatly pained the Jordanian leaders 
and people, Jordan, under his Majesty King Husayn, took the 
initiative and acted on all Arab, regional, and international 
levels to acquaint the entire international community of the 
hideousness of this type of terrorism, which undoubtedly is 
Israeli terrorism. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty the king was the first to realize the dimensions 
of this treacherous scheme that is hostile to the cordon states 
and to the peace process which is based on the international 
legitimacy resolutions. His majesty linked the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and the Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre, in 
that there is one party which planned for these two odious 
crimes. 
  His majesty also held consultations with the Lebanese and 
Syrian presidents to contain this odious scheme which seeks to 
drown the region in blood and sow sedition so as to foil it 
before it becomes uncontrollable. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat has expressed his sadness on France-2 
TV. He does not wish to express himself categorically on the 
continuation of negotiations. The interview was carried out 
exclusively by our special envoy to Tunis, Michel Montponte: 
  [Begin recording] [Montponte] It was in the middle of the 
night, as he usually does, that the PLO chairman received us in 
one of his several and discrete residences of Tunis. Looking 
clearly very hurt by the events of Hebron, his tone was grave 
and categorical; he looked more tired than usual: 
  ['Arafat] This is not one man. I am speaking as an expert. 
No man can single-handedly kill 65 people and injure 256. No 
one can do that. There is no Rambo. There were more than 10. 
  [Montponte] Mr. Chairman, do you think that today's 
incidents 
signal the breakdown of the peace process with the Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] The whole process has already lost credibility and 
even more following this massacre. This massacre is a 
conspiracy by the settlers and the Army. 
  [Montponte] Do you think violence will resume? 
  ['Arafat] Definitely. This will backfire and nobody can 
imagine the extent. 
  [Montponte] Do you personally trust Israeli justice to 
understand and find out what really happened? 
  ['Arafat] I prefer to wait and see. [end recording]

an international protection for our people. This is very 
important and the peace accord we have signed in Washington last 
September mentions an international presence, and the Israelis 
accepted that. Armed settlers are a real time bomb. We are 
asking the Israeli government to take measures, steps, and to 
take their responsibility, and to respect what they have signed. 
It is true that President Clinton offered us an invitation, but 
before that we would want to know under what umbrella. [end

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat 
has sent a letter to the president of the European Union seeking 
urgent international measures to protect Palestinians in the 
occupied territories following the Hebron massacre. 
  "I believe that the Palestinian people should be afforded 
international protection as a matter of urgency until we are 
able to achieve security, stability and prosperity," 'Arafat 
told Greek President Andreas Papandreou, whose country currently 
heads the rotating EU Presidency, in his two-page letter dated 
Friday. 
  The letter was written shortly after the assassination of 52 
Moslems by a Jewish settler who shot his victims as they were 
praying at a mosque in the town of Hebron. 
  "The massacre took place before the eyes and with the 
knowledge of the Israeli Army which has checkpoints and 
observation posts both at the entrances to the old town of 
Hebron and at the entrances to the mosque itself," 'Arafat told 
Papandreou. 
  He added that Jewish settlers opposed to the ongoing 
Israeli- 
Palestinian peace process must not be allowed to endanger that 
process "and undermine the foundations we wish to lay for a new 
period of rapprochement, good neighbourly relations and 
cooperation in Palestine and the Middle East." 
  He said that unless the controversial issue of Jewish 
settlements is resolved by the international community, there is 
little chance for peace. 
  "I am convinced that you will wish to make every effort to 
remove the source of the crisis, for the settlements are one of 
the most dangerous threats to the progress of the peace 
procedure, indeed a threat of actual failure."

  [Text] Tunis, 27 Feb (MENA)--A responsible Palestinian 
source has stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
informed the United States that he agrees in principle to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's proposal to send a Palestinian 
delegation to Washington to hold continuous sessions with a 
similar Israeli delegation to discuss starting to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  The same source said that when 'Arafat received U.S. 
Ambassador to Tunisia John McCarthy, he asked for some 
clarifications regarding the level of the negotiating 
delegations, the date for beginning the negotiations, the reason 
for moving them from Cairo to Washington, and the role the 
United States will play in these negotiations. 
  The Palestinian official added that 'Arafat informed the 
United States of the need for an Egyptian presence during the 
negotiations and that Egypt should play a clear role because it 
has been following the negotiations since they started. It has 
also been the host country, both in Cairo and Taba, ever since 
the Declaration of Principles was signed. 
  The Tunisian paper AS-SABAH today quoted informed 
Palestinian sources as saying that the Palestinian leadership is 
in the process of drafting a detailed memorandum to be handed to 
the U.S. Administration and the Israeli Government. The 
memorandum contains several demands that need to be met before 
returning to the negotiating table. The memorandum contains the 
following: 
  1. All those connected with the Hebron massacre must be put 
on trial, particularly since the Palestinian leadership has 
confirmed information that the massacre was not an individual or 
isolated incident as Israel is trying to show, but was conducted 
with the participation and the collusion of leaders of their 
Army. According to the information, there were more that 20 
assailants involved in the Hebron massacre, including soldiers 
and settlers. 
  2. That the settlers in the occupied territories be 
disarmed, security settlements be dismantled, and the 
settlements' extremist leaders expelled from the occupied 
territories and banned from returning there. 
  3. That the Qiryat Arba' settlement near Hebron, which is a 
bastion of Jewish extremists in the occupied territories, be 
dismantled. 
  4. That the issue of Jerusalem be put on the agenda of the 
talks and protection given to the unarmed Palestinian 
inhabitants of Jerusalem against the practices of the Israeli 
Army and settlers, in view of the Hebron massacre. 
  5. That Israel accept the entry of international troops into 
the cities, villages, and camps on the West Bank, including East 
Jerusalem, that are not subject to the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  6. That the timetable for the Israeli withdrawals from Gaza 
and Jericho be fully honored and the Palestinian security forces 
allowed to enter as soon as possible. 
  The same Palestinian sources pointed out that the majority 
among the Palestinian leaders insists on the need to suspend the 
negotiations if no "clear-cut and explicit" decision is made to 
prevent the settlers' excesses and crimes. The sources noted 
that the Palestinian leadership is also awaiting a clear-cut and 
explicit stand from the U.S. Administration that would reflect 
its credibility in cosponsoring the peace process.

  [Text] Tunis, Feb 27 (AFP)--PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat on 
Sunday [27 February] dismissed as inadequate the Israeli 
Government's response to the massacre of 52 Palestinians in 
Hebron. 
  Arafat told journalists that the cabinet decisions were 
"empty gestures and do not represent an adequate response" to 
Friday's slaughter. 
  The Israeli cabinet on Sunday gave the army the power to 
disarm hardline Jewish settlers, restrict their movements and 
place them in administrative detention. 
  It also agreed to form a committee of enquiry into the 
massacre, and to release up to 1,000 of some 10,000 jailed 
Palestinians as a gesture. 
  Arafat is to chair an emergency meeting of the PLO 
leadership 
here late Sunday to decide whether to resume peace talks with 
Israel. 
  President Bill Clinton wants Israel and the PLO to hold 
non-stop talks in Washington in a bid to seal agreement on the 
overdue launch of Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 
  Israeli settlers denounced the government's response as 
going 
too far. 
  The Council of Jewish Communities in Judaea, Samaria and 
Gaza 
"rejected out of hand the proposals by irresponsible politicians 
... to confiscate the weapons of Jews living (in the 
territories) and to punish Israeli citizens without a trial. 
  "Making people more vulnerable is no way to calm the 
situation," it said.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Muhammad </F>
Kurayshan on 27 February, in Tunis -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kurayshan] How do you react to the measures taken 
by the Israeli Government against Jewish settlers in the 
occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] I regret to say that the decisions are hollow and 
weak compared to the enormity and seriousness of the crime and 
the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Israeli Government 
barely scratched the surface of the problem. It failed to get 
to the bottom of the problem. It said nothing about the 
collusion of units from the Israeli military. There is proof 
that Israeli military units provided cover for the withdrawal of 
the band that committed the crime. They even opened fire on 
people and worshipers. Eight martyrs and more than 30 wounded 
fell to military gunfire. I am here quoting Israel radio. 
  I regret to say that the decisions are far too weak in 
comparison to the crime. We would have wished that the Israeli 
Government had taken deterrent action against these criminals. 
I am sorry to tell you that the Israeli Government is too 
(?weak) to do that. If this tells us anything, it is that the 
Israeli Government does not want to lay clear foundations for 
peace. From the moment we began the negotiations, they have 
been talking intermittently about security for the settlements 
and settlers. What about security for the Palestinians, our 
children, women, and masses? What about security for our 
Islamic and Christian holy places? Let's not forget the al- 
Aqsa Mosque massacre that was carried out by Israeli military 
and security forces a few years ago. And now a massacre 
committed by armed settlers in which Israeli military men were 
also involved. 
  Yesterday, we saw television pictures of Israeli military 
patrols [words indistinct] by patrols of armed settlers. I will 
tell them this: Who do you think you are fooling with these 
decisions? In any case, I never expected this government to 
come up with more than that. 
  [Kurayshan] But don't you think that disarming so-called 
extremists around Hebron and its vicinity may mark the first of 
more stringent measures in the future? 
  ['Arafat] There are entire settlements run by these 
extremists. I would like to remind Rabin of his reference to 
political settlements run by political organizations. These are 
his words and not mine. Let him dismantle these political 
settlements if he is serious and does want peace. If the idea 
behind the decisions is to mollify angry world opinion, then 
they will not make a real difference. There is much more than 
that at stake. They must know that our blood is not water and 
that it will not be spilled in vain. 
  [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: Moreover, it was announced today 
that the occupied territories will be closed. 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] Was it only today? What about 
yesterday? In other words, the punishment is not directed 
against the armed settlers but against the Palestinian people. 
Yesterday and today, confrontations erupted in Rafah, Khan 
Yunus, Gaza, Hebron, Bethlehem, Jerusalem, Jericho, Ramallah, 
Nabulus, Tulkarm, Janin, Qalqilyah; namely, throughout the 
country. The decision made by the Israeli army and government 
was to escalate the situation against the Palestinian people. 
  The Israelis say that the four people whom they want to 
arrest could not been arrested because they were holding a 
conference. Who are they deceiving? However, everyone should 
know that this will not undermine our people's determination, 
will, and resolve. We are a people who offered many martyrs. 
We are the guards of these holy lands and places. 
  As a saying by Prophet Muhammad goes: A group of my nation 
is still preserving the religion, confronting their enemy, and 
is not harmed by its enemies. This group will triumph with 
God's help. Some people asked the prophet: Where is and what is 
this group? The prophet answered: It is in Jerusalem and around 
it, and it will be in a state of mobilization until the day of 
judgment. 
  This is thus a divine message for this people, the guards of 
these holy places. 
  [Kurayshan] Mr. Chairman: There is also hesitation on the 
level of the UN Security Council about passing a resolution in 
this regard. How do you view this hesitation? 
  ['Arafat] Regrettably, the U.S. Administration tried to 
prevent the convening of a session. However, we, along with the 
Arab, Islamic, and nonaligned groups as well as our friends in 
Europe and the world, insisted that a session should be held. 
We submitted a draft resolution which, first and foremost, 
provides for international protection for our people, masses, 
children, and women. 
  All should know that these settlements are illegal, 
according 
to several Security Council and UN resolutions. They are also 
time bombs and constitute not only obstacles to peace but also 
walls and mines against the peace process. I regret to say that 
we do not agree on the U.S. draft resolution, and that we 
insisted on the draft resolution submitted by the Arab group. 
There is also a French draft resolution, which is not a bad 
one. However, it is sad that the U.S. draft resolution did not 
mention the Ibrahimi Mosque by name. Instead, it mentioned the 
Ibrahimi Mosque by its Israeli name. This mosque was built 
during the Umayyad times in the seventh century. 
  [Kurayshan] Originally, it was decided that the issue of 
the settlements should be postponed until the final status of 
the occupied territory is discussed. Do you believe what has 
happened requires discussing this issue now before the final 
status is reached? 
  ['Arafat] They say they want to take the weapons from the 
extremists. But there are settlements in their names. From 
Qiryat Arba' to Baruk [Goldstein] and so on, and so on. They 
know them. More than once, Rabin said there are political 
settlements which belong to political organizations. Let us see 
what measures he will take. 
  [Kurayshan] You invited the negotiating Palestinian teams 
and 
you will meet in Tunis... 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] Here they are. Sa'ib ['Urayqat] has 
just arrived; my brother Nabil [Sha'th] has just arrived; my 
brother Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] arrived yesterday. Today the 
Palestinian leadership will hold a session to evaluate the 
situation. 
  [Kurayshan] What is expected in light of the Israeli 
Government's decisions? 
  ['Arafat] I really do not like to give details before this 
issue is thrashed out in details and in all its aspects with the 
Palestinian leadership and in the presence of my brothers the 
delegations heads. 
  [Kurayshan] What is the chance of responding to U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's invitation to go to Washington, in 
light of all that has happened. 
  ['Arafat] We thank President Clinton because of this 
invitation, which shows his interest. However, before this, we 
want to know which way we are heading. Are we going to take 
pictures, as happened last September? Following this, Rabin 
said there are no sacred dates. When we spoke of an 
international presence, he said there are no sacred points? 
This in effect means that there is no sacred agreement. Before 
the Israeli Government answers us on all these things and before 
we know the results of the Security Council meeting, we cannot 
give answers. Let it be known, we will not allow the continued 
killing of our people. Our blood will not be in vain. We are 
all potential martyrs in defense of these sacred places. We are 
potential martyrs and pioneers for our Arab and Islamic nations. 
  [Kurayshan] In conclusion, how do you view the remainder of 
the march in the peace process, especially since you had been on 
the verge of tackling all the existing differences, as has been 
reported. Now after the massacre, and after it has become 
clear... 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] It has become clear that in the 
Israeli Army there are officers, forces, and commanders who 
oppose the peace process. They are conniving with the settlers 
and are forming a bloc [preceding word in English] to carry out 
these massacres. Regrettably, this is what has transpired.

  [Text] Tunis, 27 Feb (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has sent a written message to President Husni Mubarak on 
developments in the Palestinian stand after the massacre 
committed by the Israeli settlers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron the day before yesterday. 
  Ambassador Ibrahim 'Allam, Egypt's ambassador in Tunis, 
stated that 'Arafat asked President Mubarak to keep up the great 
Egyptian stand which supports and backs the rights of the 
Palestinian people. He added that 'Arafat affirmed the 
importance of, and need for this stand at this stage after the 
massacre committed by the Israeli settlers in the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque. 
  He said that 'Arafat also asked for Egypt's support for the 
PLO during the coming steps to remove the obstacles in the way 
of the peace talks and put an end to the violence and terrorism 
the settlers are practicing against the Palestinian people in 
the occupied territories. 
  The Egyptian ambassador added that 'Arafat's message to 
Mubarak contained an explanation of the dimensions of the 
massacre, its effect on the peace process, and the PLO's stand 
from this massacre.

  [Excerpt] Brother Abu Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of 
the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee, has had a telephone conversation late this evening 
with the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, during which they 
examined in length the U.S. President's invitation to the 
Palestinian and the Israeli sides to hold urgent talks in 
Washington. They also discussed the current emergency meeting 
of the UN Security Council to examine the Israeli horrible 
massacre carried out by Israeli settlers against Palestinian 
worshippers in the Ibrahimi shrine, and the need to take a 
decision on the provision of international protection to the 
Palestinian people as well as for the armed settlers. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Arab affairs correspondent Eldad Beck] </F>
  [Text] The PLO leadership in Tunis has already been 
apprised of today's cabinet session. The PLO declared that the 
cabinet's decisions were insufficient, failed to meet the 
Palestinians' minimum demands, and disappointing. We spoke with 
Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, a short 
while ago. Dr. al-Tibi commented on the steps slated to be 
taken against the Kakh activists, including their disarmament. 
Al-Tibi said we are not dealing with a small group of people 
and asserted that a large number of settlers should be disarmed. 
Ahmad al-Tibi called for an immediate solution to the problem 
of the Jewish settlements, especially those located in the heart 
of Arab population centers. Al-Tibi said: A new era has ensued 
in the wake of the massacre in Hebron and the Israeli Government 
decisions do not meet its demands. In short, Ahmad al-Tibi 
described today's cabinet decisions as disappointing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jibril al-Rajub, Yasir 'Arafat's aide, in </F>
Tunis, by Gid'on Zelinger and Moti Amir, recorded `earlier 
today'; place not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Rajub] What did 'Arafat mean? He meant that 
the killing of innocent people -- as was the case in Hebron 
today -- must stop. 
  [Zelinger] What is the chairman's mood? Did you meet him 
this morning? 
  [Al-Rajub] I was the first one who received the information 
about the Hebron incident, and I was the one who called and woke 
'Arafat up. As you know, he was sleeping at the time. I gave 
him details about the incident. He was indeed very agitated. 
  [Zelinger] One of the leaders of the rejectionist front 
organizations -- those who oppose 'Arafat and the peace process 
-- suggested that 'Arafat use his personal revolver and commit 
suicide. He said that 'Arafat and his peace process are a 
failure. 
  [Al-Rajub] Look, nobody will teach us how to behave in such 
situations. I think that the lunatic and insane person who 
perpetrated the murder in Hebron today killed all the 
possibilities of pursuing the peace process. 
  [Zelinger] Is it that bad? 
  [Al-Rajub] Yes, this is what I believe. But those who 
oppose us can say whatever they want. They won't teach 'Arafat 
and Fatah how to behave in such situations. 
  [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you are 'Arafat's adviser for West 
Bank affairs and are familiar with the Hebron events. You know 
that only one individual was responsible for this criminal 
attack. Do you believe that this tragic and criminal incident 
was the last nail in the Oslo agreement's coffin, and is this 
what you advised 'Arafat? 
  [Al-Rajub] This is my personal opinion. I do not believe 
this was the work of one person. I do not think he could have 
perpetrated the attack without the support of somebody from the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] or the Israeli security services. 
  [Zelinger] I want to understand, Mr. al-Rajub, are you 
recommending that 'Arafat terminate -- or at least freeze -- the 
peace process? 
  [Al-Rajub] I am expressing my opinion as a fighter and a 
Palestinian. This is my personal opinion. 
  [Zelinger] So you are speaking to us as a fighter and not as 
a man of peace? 
  [Al-Rajub] I am a Palestinian citizen and fighter, as you 
know. I think that the man who shot the worshipers today killed 
all the possibilities for continuing the peace process in the 
region. 
  [Zelinger] I want to understand you better; do you believe 
that the current peace process, based on the Oslo 
understandings, has no chances of success? 
  [Al-Rajub] I do not think that any progress has been made. 
There was talk of progress, but the agreement should have been 
implemented months ago, but nothing was done yet. 
  [Zelinger] Is this your personal opinion? We heard a 
similar opinion expressed by several opposition members in the 
territories. What does 'Arafat think? 
  [Al-Rajub] The PLO leadership is currently meeting. I 
believe 'Arafat is under great stress. I think that it is still 
impossible to understand or speak about what happened in Hebron 
today. 
  [Zelinger] One thing is certain, though. The position you 
are expressing is playing into the hands of all those who oppose 
the peace process, whether Jews or Arabs. 
  [Al-Rajub] Look, I also cannot understand how after this 
incident people were still killed by the IDF....[several words 
indistinct] Our blood is also sacred. 
  [Zelinger] Will you resign if 'Arafat pursues the peace 
process? 
  [Al-Rajub] I will draw my own conclusions. 
  [Amir] Jibril al-Rajub, you have heard the torrent of 
denunciations coming from the direction of the Israeli 
president, prime minister, and ministers. All of them referred 
to it as a tragic and despicable act perpetrated by one person. 
The Israeli supporters of the peace process are anxiously 
following this process and we are greatly interested in what the 
Palestinians think. You -- 'Arafat's aide -- are saying that 
this act terminated the entire peace process. Will Yasir 
'Arafat pursue the peace process? 
  [Al-Rajub] I am not the chairman's spokesman. You must 
realize, however, that there is a difference between denouncing 
such attacks and between taking steps to prevent their 
recurrence. I do not think this was the first such incident, 
but it is extremely grave and I believe we must draw the 
appropriate conclusions as a nation and an organization. Two 
months ago we started talking about peace and coexistence, but 
so far nothing has moved in that direction. 
  [Zelinger] You presented yourself both as 'Arafat's aide and 
a fighter. What do you have to say today to your fighters in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank -- the Fatah Hawks? Will they 
receive new instructions now? 
  [Al-Rajub] It is possible that they will receive new 
instructions. If real means to protect the Palestinian citizens 
are not implemented I think we will have to issue new orders. I 
say this with regret. 
  [Amir] Does this mean breaking the agreement on a cessation 
to Fatah hostile acts and resuming the attacks? 
  [Al-Rajub] I am afraid that unless real measures are not 
taken to protect the Palestinian citizens there will be new 
orders. 
  [Zelinger] Is it possible that you are speaking now in a 
state of extreme agitation and that you will change your mind in 
the next few days? 
  [Al-Rajub] I cannot say so now, but let's wait and see. 
  [Zelinger] I want to thank you, Jibril al-Rajub -- one of 
the most senior aides of 'Arafat in Tunis. I understand you 
want to add something before we take our leave of you. 
  [Al-Rajub] I only wanted to tell you that for us war is not 
an end, but only a means of achieving peace and security for our 
people. In this case I do not think it is the right way 
[sentence as heard].

  [Text] Tunis, Feb 25 (AFP)--PLO-Israeli negotiations to 
launch autonomy in the occupied territories will continue 
despite Friday's [25 February] massacre of more than 50 
Palestinians at a Hebron mosque, an aide to chief Yasir 'Arafat 
said here. 
  Sakhr Habash, a member of the central committee of Arafat's 
Fatah movement, ruled out a suspension of the autonomy talks. 
"On the contrary, these acts show that peace is needed urgently." 
  Under the September 13 autonomy accord with the PLO, Israel 
was to have begun withdrawing troops from the West Bank town of 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip about three months ago but 
negotiations have snagged on security issues. 
  Habash said there was a risk of reprisals from Palestinians 
in the occupied territories over the massacre at the mosque in 
Hebron, the West Bank. Hardline groups opposed to the peace 
talks have vowed to carry out revenge attacks. 
  Habash said the United States was mainly responsible for the 
massacre, adding that the gunman, Baruch Goldestein, was of 
American origin and a product of racist US-Jewish groups. 
  "The United States must respond to these psychopathic groups 
... because their interests are against peace," Habash said. 
  Habash also laid the blame on the United Nations for failing 
to give international protection to Palestinians in the 
territories. 
  PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat called for "international 
protection" for the Palestinians in the territories. His envoy 
at the UN was hopeful that the Security Council would hold an 
emergency meeting to discuss the massacre later Friday. 
  The PLO also declared three days of mourning and a general 
strike in the occupied territories after the massacre of more 
than 40 Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  The PLO denounced the shooting as "criminal slaughter" and 
said the Israeli government was responsible, a PLO statement 
said earlier. 
  The international community, including the co-sponsors of 
the 
peace process Russia and the United States, should act to "put 
an end to such massacres." 
  Official PLO spokesman Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said between 20 to 
30 Jewish settlers led by an Israeli army captain carried out 
the massacre. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh rejected Israel's "lying version" which said a 
lone gunman, Goldestein, shot dead 53 Palestinians at the West 
Bank mosque during dawn prayers. 
  "The PLO blames the Israeli government and its army for this 
crime," 'Abd-Rabbuh said at a press conference here. 
  'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four 
to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in 
prayer. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
telephoned PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat to apologise for the attack.

  [Text] Most of Yasir 'Arafat's aides believe the peace 
process must be pursued, because halting the process would be 
tantamount to giving a prize to the insane murderer who acted in 
Hebron. This was said this evening by a senior source in the 
PLO leadership to our correspondent Moti Amir. He also said 
that tonight or tomorrow morning it will become clear whether 
the peace process will continue in its present format in 
Washington. The source emphasized Yasir 'Arafat is facing 
severe pressures by various PLO factions which are opposed to 
the continuation of the peace process, and is continuing his 
consultations in Tunis.

  [Text] Tunis, 26 Feb (MENA)--The Palestinian leadership has 
decided to recall the Palestinian delegations to the 
negotiations with Israel in Washington, Paris, Cairo, and Taba 
to discuss the Palestinian position in the wake of the massacre 
perpetrated by Israeli settlers in the plaza of the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday. 
  PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah told a MENA 
correspondent in Tunis that at its meeting last night, the 
Palestinian leadership also requested an urgent Arab League 
meeting to discuss the massacre and take the necessary measures. 
The PLO asked its Arab League representative to present the 
request. 
  The PLO will also follow up efforts to convene an urgent UN 
Security Council meeting to adopt a positive stance on the 
events. 
  Ghawshah said the Palestinian leadership had decided to call 
the PLO Executive Committee into a full urgent meeting in Tunis 
to follow developments. 
  On the Palestinian leadership's position on U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's invitation for the PLO and Israel to send 
delegations to Washington to hold prompt talks to advance the 
peace process, Dr. Samir Ghawshah said the Palestinian 
leadership has not yet determined its position on the 
invitation. He added: The purpose of the talks, the level of 
attendance, and the date must be known. So far, the PLO has 
received no details about the call. 
  Dr. Ghawshah denied reports that President Clinton had 
invited 'Arafat for a meeting with Rabin in Washington. 
  He said the Palestinian leadership will follow the results 
of 
the massacre on all levels, especially the developments in the 
occupied territories. 
  He added: We are awaiting the decisions Israel is going to 
make regarding the massacre, and we will determine our position 
accordingly. We want to know whether Rabin wants to achieve 
peace and security or to keep the territory and sponsor the 
settlers. 
  Ghawshah said the recall of the Palestinian negotiators is 
in 
preparation for the adoption of a clear position on the 
negotiations--suspending them, withdrawing from them, or 
boycotting them. 
  He said the situation is very serious in the occupied 
territories. We are discussing all aspects of the issue and 
will make the decision that preserves our people, he said. 
  Ghawshah stressed that the peace process is in a crisis 
after 
the massacre, which showed the world that it is the 
Palestinians, not the Israeli settlers, who need security.

  [Text] The decision to suspend the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations was described on the Palestinian level as being 
good news and the beginning of collective Arab action. 
  This was said by Samir Ghawshah who was speaking in Tunis at 
the end of the first meeting of the PLO Executive Committee in 
the presence of the Palestinian negotiating teams. 
  These meetings seek to define the stand toward the U.S. 
initiative for resuming the negotiations between the Israelis 
and the Palestinians in Washington. The PLO Executive Committee 
listened to a report by Palestinian delegation head Sa'ib 
'Uraqyqat on the contacts with Washington. In light of this 
report, the Executive Committee viewed the U.S. initiative as a 
formal one and devoid of any content. The PLO Executive 
Committee then wondered about the reason for moving the 
negotiations to Washington and the representation level of the 
delegations. It stressed that negotiations are not the 
Palestinians' destiny and that the Palestinian people are 
pursuing the intifadah in the occupied territories, as Samir 
Ghawshah said. Ghawshah also emphasized the PLO Executive 
committee's rejection of the measures adopted by the Israeli 
cabinet yesterday because they are insufficient and do not meet 
even the minimum Palestinian demands.

  [Text] Tunis, 28 Feb (MENA)--The PLO Executive Committee 
has announced that it rejects the decisions the Israeli 
Government adopted last night on handling the situation in the 
occupied territories following the massacre committed at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on Friday [25 February]. 
  PLO Executive Committee Member Dr. Samir Ghawshah told a 
MENA 
correspondent in Tunis that at a meeting last night, the 
committee emphasized its rejection of the Israeli response to 
the demands sent by the PLO after the massacre. The demands 
were to disarm settlers, remove settlements, and provide 
protection for the Palestinians. 
  Ghawshah remarked that the decisions the PLO received after 
the Israeli Cabinet meeting yesterday were bad, not in 
proportion with the nature of the massacre, contained nothing 
new, and failed to provide solutions. 
  He added that the decisions indicate that Rabin's government 
is maintaining the policy of hegemony, intransigence, stalling 
for time, and failing to provide any solutions or even give a 
chance to efforts to deal with what happened. He said the 
Israelis proposed disarming a limited, specific number of 
individual settlers. But they refused to provide international 
protection for the Palestinian citizens under occupation. He 
explained that this means maintaining the settlements as an 
armed force in violation of the law and agreements. He stressed 
that the Palestinians cannot accept the existence of an 
irregular armed force when they take charge of security in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  Ghawshah added that the Executive Committee also discussed 
the American proposal to hold urgent negotiations between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides in Washington. He pointed out 
that there is a general feeling within the committee that 
changing the venue of the talks will be useless if the same 
lists of negotiators are maintained, if the United States does 
not play a basic role as a partner and sponsor of the peace 
process, if pressure is not put on Israel to honor its 
commitments, and if the essence of these negotiations remains 
the same. 
  He explained that the U.S. proposal, which the PLO approved 
in principle, raises many questions on its ultimate goal: Does 
it really aim to boost the peace process or just to contain the 
situation resulting from the massacre? He pointed out that the 
American response to these questions and the U.S. proposals 
involve no real change in the peace process in terms of its 
essence and form or in terms of the U.S. bias toward Israel. 
  Ghawshah noted that no final decision has been made on 
participation in the Washington talks or on the date for this 
participation. He added that this issue is still being 
discussed. 
  The Palestinian official added that the committee will 
resume 
its meetings tonight with the participation of the heads of the 
negotiating teams to follow up on the decisions the UN Security 
Council will adopt. He remarked that these decisions will 
reflect the real stance of the Council members on the peace 
process, particularly the stance of the United States. 
  Ghawshah praised the resolutions adopted last night by the 
Arab League Council, saying they constitute a real starting 
point and an excellent step toward restoring Arab solidarity and 
supporting the lawful rights of the Palestinian people. 
  He affirmed that the decision in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan 
to suspend talks with the Israeli side in Washington in protest 
of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre shows that coordination and 
solidarity have returned and that the pan-Arab common interest 
and national security take priority over everything else.

<F P=106> [Report from Tunis by Orli Katz-Azulay] </F>
  [Excerpts] Despite PLO leaders' declarations that "there 
will be no talks with Israel until it reviews its stands," 
efforts are being made to arrange an 'Arafat-Rabin meeting in 
Washington tomorrow. This was learned last night from 
unofficial sources in Tunis. 
  Beginning at 1700 yesterday, the bureaus of Rabin and 
'Arafat 
exchanged messages containing the two sides' questions and 
answers. One of the central issues addressed in the messages was 
the number of detainees the PLO wanted to see released at once, 
compared with the cabinet decision yesterday to release only 800. 
  Apparently the exchange of messages will be continued only 
following the PLO leaders' meeting with Yasir 'Arafat at his 
Tunis headquarters tonight. The fate of the Rabin-'Arafat 
encounter will be also decided after the PLO meeting. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday 'Arafat convened the nucleus of the PLO leadership 
to decide on future steps with regard to the peace negotiations. 
The PLO top echelons demand that the following terms be met: 
  -- All Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in Israel are to 
be 
released at once, and the deportees are to be permitted to 
return. 
  -- The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will begin withdrawing at 
once from Gaza and Jericho, and the vacuum will be filled by 
armed Palestinian policemen. 
  -- The negotiations will address the settlement issue. 
  -- Armed settlers will be banished from the area, and weapon 
stockpiles will be removed from the settlements. 
  Until all this happens, the PLO leadership wants an 
international force to enter the territories to protect the 
Palestinians. Senior PLO officials announced yesterday that 
they will resign if 'Arafat returns to the negotiations with 
Israel before the new PLO terms are met. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F>
Information Department, by Salah Salamah in the studio on 24 
February--recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron has 
shocked the occupied territory and alerted all Palestinian 
forces in and outside the occupied territory. What is the 
latest information about the number of casualties? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far, more than 60 Palestinian martyrs have 
fallen in Hebron and more than 270 Palestinians have been 
injured. The Israeli Army is participating with the settlers in 
the killing operations and in collective terrorism against the 
Palestinian people in steadfast Hebron. Clearly, this crime was 
well-planned. 
  [Salamah] In fact, some say the massacre is the work of one 
man, but other reports say it was an organized massacre. What 
information do you have about this? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Such a great number of martyrs and wounded 
cannot have fallen as a result of one man's work. A great 
number of settlers entered the Ibrahimi Mosque. They were armed 
and they entered under the eyes of the Israeli Army which, has 
strict security measures in place at all entrances to the 
Ibrahimi Mosque. These settlers opened fire on the worshipers 
while they were prostrated during dawn prayers. Therefore, all 
indications are that the operation was a large-scale one aimed 
at creating large-scale terror and fear. Palestinians in all 
areas are now confronting this crime and its perpetrators with 
all their resources. These murderers and criminals must be 
confronted with all our resources. 
  [Salamah] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, in your opinion, will this 
pogrom affect the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the 
PLO? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] It is clear now that the presence of the 
settlers and settlements in the heart of Palestinian territory 
is a time bomb that explodes every now and then to kill more 
people. Therefore, it is clear that no actual peace, either in 
a provisional or in a final form, will be achieved while the 
settlements are in existence. 
  [Salamah] Does this mean that during its current 
negotiations 
with Israel, the PLO will present the problem of the settlements 
that will remain in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli withdrawal? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Not just the issue of the settlements in the 
Gaza Strip. 
  [Salamah] I mean at this particular stage, Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Yes, I am talking about this stage. All the 
Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are 
an obstacles on the path of any arrangements to make peace. 
Therefore, the existence of the settlements is the point at 
issue now. No actual peace will be accepted with the presence 
of the settlers and these murderous gangs, who will destroy not 
only the peace process but the way of life of the Palestinian 
people. These have always been their aims. It has proven to be 
the same today. 
  [Salamah] Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh, what possible measures might the 
PLO take to face the possibility of similar massacres in the 
occupied territories? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] As I have said, there is the issue of the 
existence of settlers. We must confront this existence by all 
means and resources. The issue of ending the existence of the 
settlements must be at the forefront of the issues that will be 
considered with the aim of realizing steps toward a just and 
real peace. Moreover, we have presented this urgent issue to 
the UN Security Council to take urgent measures so the UN 
Security Council will reiterate that the existence of the 
settlements is illegitimate and that they must be removed from 
occupied Palestinian territory, and also to provide 
international protection for the Palestinian people. Within 
this framework, we appeal to all the forces that wish to see 
peace, and to the Arab and Islamic worlds, to shoulder real 
responsibility along side of the Palestinian people in these 
difficult circumstances. 
  I repeat here that the Palestinian people will know how to 
confront this massacre. Those who committed it will pay a real 
price in exchange for every drop of Palestinian blood. 
  [Salamah] Thank, You, 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank You.

  [Text] Tunis, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Between 20 to 30 Jewish 
settlers led by an Israeli army captain carried out Friday's [25 
February] massacre at the Hebron mosque, official PLO spokesman 
Yasir 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said. 
  'Abd-al-Rabbuh rejected Israel's "lying version" which said 
a 
lone gunman, Baruk Goldstein, shot dead 53 Palestinians at the 
West Bank mosque during dawn prayers. 
  "The PLO blames the Israeli government and its army for this 
crime," 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said at a press conference here. 
  'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four 
to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in 
prayer. 
  'Abd-al-Rabbuh said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
telephoned PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat to apologise for the attack. 
  The PLO declared three days of mourning and a general strike 
in the occupied territories after the massacre of more than 40 
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  The PLO denounced the shooting as "criminal slaughter" and 
said the Israeli government was responsible, a PLO statement 
said earlier. 
  The international community, including the co-sponsors of 
the 
peace process Russia and the United States, should act to "put 
an end to such massacres." 
  It repeated PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's call for 
"international protection" for the Palestinians in the 
territories. 
  The PLO is currently trying to clinch a deal with Israel on 
launching Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] It seems that the PLO leadership wants now to start 
off again from the Hebron mosque massacre to strongly raise the 
question of settlers and settlements in the occupied territories 
once and for all. 
  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member, today 
urged the Israeli Government to disarm the gangs of settlers. 
At a news conference in Tunis, 'Abd-Rabbuh said the presence of 
the settlers contradicts the course of peace as a whole. He 
added: 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The first step is to disarm 
those gangs. Without this, there will be no guarantee of making 
any achievement on the road of peace. Today's crime shows that 
the settlers in the occupied territories represent a time bomb 
that could explode at any moment and threaten the peace process 
and thwart any steps for peace. This makes it necessary to 
discuss the entire question of the presence of the settlers. It 
is impossible to reconcile gangs of killers and peace. [end 
recording] 
  'Abd-Rabbuh, who cast doubt on the Israeli version of the 
incident as a whole and deemed it a sort of connivance with the 
criminals, said the operation was carried out by a group made up 
of 20 to 30 settlers. He accused several senior Israeli Army 
officers of collusion to facilitate the killing of Palestinians. 
  The Palestinian official said the Palestinian leadership's 
decision regarding the continuation of the peace process as a 
whole is linked to several factors. 
  [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] We are waiting for specific 
measures from the Security Council to ensure international 
protection of Palestinian citizens. Second, we will wait for a 
resolution by the Security Council asserting that the presence 
of settlers and settlements is illegal and that the settlements 
should be removed. Third, the Israeli Government should take 
measures, the minimum of which, and the first step, is to disarm 
the gangs of settlers. In light of these factors, we will spell 
out our position in the coming phase. [end recording] 
  The PLO is still engaged in a flurry of activity to ensure a 
successful course of action by the Security Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F>
Information Department, by MBC Tunis correspondent Mufidah 
al-Hashani in Tunis on 25 February--live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Hashani] What is this massacre's practical 
impact on the peace process and the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations, specifically on the PLO's stance vis-a-vis these 
negotiations? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Actually, there will be a great impact because 
the first thing we now want from the world and from the Israeli 
side is not just words of denunciation and condemnation. We are 
waiting for two urgent measures: the first is a Security 
Council meeting and the adoption of measures stressing the 
illegality of the construction and presence of settlements on 
Palestinian land. The second is the immediate disarming of the 
settlers because these criminal gangs--gangs of 
murderers--represent a time bomb threatening and undermining any 
steps toward peace. 
  [Al-Hashani] Has the PLO received response from any Western 
countries to holding a Security Council session? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some preliminary responses have been received 
by noon today and we expect some more... 
  [Al-Hashani, interrupting] Were they positive? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some were positive and we are waiting for 
other 
responses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, chief of the PLO </F>
Information Department, by Faridah al-Shubashi; place and date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-Rabbuh] The Palestinian leadership held a 
meeting last night to discuss the results of the massacre in the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque. The Palestinian leadership believes that 
the decisions made by the Israeli Government do not meet the 
minimum requirements under these circumstances for the 
resumption of the talks. These decisions are an insult to the 
blood of the Palestinian martyrs and encourage the settlers and 
their gangs to continue their hostile acts against the 
Palestinian people, as well as their daily violations and 
crimes. This stand has been communicated to all concerned 
parties. We do not believe that the talks can be held while 
this serious and explosive situation is being ignored. This 
situation is caused by the settlers' acts and crimes in the 
Palestinian territory. The Israeli Government should put an end 
to the role of the settlers' and their activities. They also 
should put an end to the presence of a number of settlements in 
Gaza and the West Bank, particularly in Hebron -- where Qiryat 
Arba' represents a hotbed of terrorist and criminal activities 
against the Palestinian masses. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said 
today that the Palestinians do not have any option other than 
that of returning to the negotiations with Israel. He added 
that the Israeli Government has taken firm measures to avert 
violence, assassinations, and attempts to wreck the peace 
process, although the entire world has seen footage of the 
settlers attending Goldstein's funeral ceremony, in which he was 
deemed a hero and a martyr. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] The real option before us and before all those 
who want to achieve peace is to end the role of settlers in the 
Palestinian territories. We cannot conceive of a peace 
agreement at a time when there is an additional army of 
terrorists and killers engaged in the perpetration of the most 
heinous crimes on the Palestinian territories, and enjoying the 
official support and protection of the Israeli Government. The 
Palestinian leadership is continuing its contacts and work in 
this regard. At present, we are working to ensure the passage 
of a UN Security Council resolution providing for international 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. Such a resolution must also condemn the settlers' 
activities, and deem their presence illegal as established by 
previous resolutions issued by the UN Security Council. These 
demands currently constitute the required guarantee for reaching 
a peace agreement, and indeed, for implementing the peace 
agreement on the ground. Consequently, the option raised at 
present is that of providing the requirements of true peace, the 
requirements that would help achieve such peace. Broad sectors 
of the world community are aware that it is impossible to 
achieve coexistence, and to create circumstances conducive to 
peace as long as settlements exist and as long as the time bomb 
called settlers and their armed groups remain. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Does this mean that the choice will also be a 
diplomatic one? Peres said your only option is to resume the 
negotiations, and you are saying that the other option is to 
mobilize world public opinion or to contact the world following 
this massacre to support the Palestinians. What about the U.S. 
stand? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] In the next two days, we will dispatch an 
envoy 
to Washington to discuss all these matters with the U.S. 
Administration. The issue is not about resuming talks just to 
show that the peace process is continuing. What is required is 
to link the resumption of talks with effective measures to stop 
this cancer, because the presence of settlers undermines peace 
opportunities. Both issues -- the settlements and the resumption 
and success of the talks -- have become intertwined. 
  The option is not only a diplomatic one. In order to protect 
themselves -- and given the protection provided by the Israeli 
occupation forces to the settlements' activities and role -- the 
Palestinians now have the right to carry weapons to defend 
themselves. Within this context, we call for a large-scale Arab 
and friendly campaign to support the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territory, particularly since the Israeli Government's 
decisions, which include some individual and limited measures 
against a few number of the settlers just to throw dust in the 
eyes, also include measures to maintain the siege and collective 
punishment against all the Palestinian people in the Palestinian 
territory. This means the continuation of the starvation war 
and comprehensive terrorism. The victims are punished 
collectively, individual or light measures are being taken 
against some criminals only to avoid crisis and strong reactions 
by world public opinion. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Has the Palestinian leadership accepted 
President Clinton's invitation to resume the talks with Israel 
next week, as has been reported? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] I have said that we will send an envoy to 
Washington to explain our stand, a second envoy to Moscow, and a 
third to some European countries to explain that there is more 
to the issue than resuming the talks. The important issue is 
that it is impossible to ensure the success of the talks when 
there is a time bomb jeopardizing them -- the presence of 
settlers, their daily acts of sabotage, and the threat they pose 
to the lives of Palestinians. 
  [Al-Shubashi] Thank you, Mr. Yasir. 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank you.

  [Excerpts] Capitals, 26 Feb (SANA)--Denunciation and 
condemnation of the unprecedented ugly crime and bestial 
massacre, in which scores of believers were martyred or wounded 
at the hands of the Zionists in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
yesterday, are continuing. [passage omitted] 
  PLO Executive Committee member Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi 
condemned the ugly massacre perpetrated by the Zionist settlers 
in collusion with the occupation forces. Reached by telephone 
today, al-Nashashibi told SANA that the massacre crowns the 
arbitrary measures being practiced by the Israeli occupation 
authorities against the Palestinan Arab people to prevent them 
from regaining their full national rights. 
  Al-Nashashibi called for stopping the PLO's negotiations 
with 
Israel and for moving immediately to negotiations on the 
comprehensive and final status on the basis of the Israeli 
forces' withdrawal from all the occupied territories in 
accordance with the resolutions of the international legitimacy 
which can secure the Palestinian Arab people's rights and 
achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, by Fayiz 'Umar in 
Jerusalem on 25 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Husayni] What happened, in fact, proves the 
gravity of the situation and that the presence of the Israeli 
Army or settlers in the occupied Palestinian territories is no 
longer relevant under any circumstances. What is happening now 
is a final destruction of the peace process. 
  ['Umar] As national institutions in the area, what sort of 
measures or decisions will you be adopting in the aftermath of 
this incident? 
  [Al-Husayni] First of all, we summoned the foreign consuls 
in Jerusalem to appraise them of the gravity of the situation 
and convey to them our position and demands, which began with 
disarming the settlers and providing international protection 
for the Palestinians. The Israeli Army is unable to do so. 
Apparently, it has a specific mission, which is only directed 
against the Palestinians and provides adequate cover to the 
settlers to do whatever they want. Hence, first of all we 
demand the disarming of the settlers; second, international 
protection; and third, other measures must follow to ensure 
Israeli withdrawal on the basis that no settlements will remain 
on Palestinian soil. 
  ['Umar] Do I understand from your remarks that you support 
Mr. 'Arafat's statement this morning, which he made after the 
incident? 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact, until now we have not received any 
details of this statement, but I believe that as far as the 
current peace process is concerned, modifications must be 
introduced in the agreements that have been reached. We have 
tried as much as possible to take a step forward, although not 
complete a one, in order to advance the peace process. However, 
what has happened today proves to us that such a step will not 
be fruitful. Now, we want the talks to deal with a final 
solution. We do not believe there is need for an interim stage, 
because an interim stage will lead to further bloodshed and 
losses.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faysal al-Husayni, chairman of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, in Jerusalem, by 
Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, on the "Dialogue From Afar" 
program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Two days after the dreadful massacre 
committed against Palestinian citizens in the Ibrahimi Mosque, 
what is the situation in the occupied Arab territories? 
  [Al-Husayni] The Palestinians in Hebron, who were the 
victims 
of that massacre, are now living under a strict curfew; anyone 
who walks on the street is fired upon. The curfew is imposed on 
all other Palestinian towns: Bayt Sahur, Bayt Jala, Bethlehem, 
Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkarm, Qalqiliyah, and all the Palestinian 
towns and villages. People are moving freely in Qiryat Arba', 
the center where the crime was planned. Even the closure 
decision that the Israelis claim to have made is not in force; 
the area is not closed and the settlers are free to leave the 
settlement and return to it from Hebron and elsewhere. This 
shows the nature of the Israeli approach, which can only produce 
other such practices by the settlers--practices that the Israeli 
army completes, either by encouraging them or by participating 
in them. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is more than one question about the 
implications of that criminal act. Was there really collusion 
between the Israeli Government or the Israeli army and the 
settlers? 
  [Al-Husayni] Israel's past approach created a particular 
Israeli mentality. This mentality is not necessarily exclusive 
to settlers; it can also extend to many of the Israeli soldiers, 
whose conduct is usually in line with what these settlers want. 
For instance, this settler killed 38 Palestinians inside the 
mosque. When the worshipers came running out of the mosque to 
escape the settler's fire, the army fired on them and killed 15. 
This mentality--incriminating the Palestinian just because he 
is Palestinian and always finding excuses for the Jew just 
because he is a Jew--is the core of the problem. This is what 
makes the existence of settlements the adversary of any attempt 
to achieve peace. We believe that the settlements' continuing 
presence is tantamount to a time bomb that will blow up among us 
at any minute. That is why our basic demand is to withdraw the 
settlers and end the presence of settlements in the areas from 
which Israel will withdraw. While this is being achieved, the 
Israelis must disarm the settlers completely. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] This horrendous crime makes us pause to 
clarify things. How can the Palestinians be completely 
protected in the coming stage? 
  [Al-Husayni] The best temporary measure would be 
international protection. But the final formula must be total 
Israeli withdrawal from our occupied Palestinian territories. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Then you demand international protection? 
  [Al-Husayni] We demand international protection. But until 
this is guaranteed, several steps must be taken. They should 
start by disarming settlers, changing the army's orders to open 
fire, and, more importantly, take practical steps in 
negotiations by beginning to withdraw immediately from Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What about continuing peace talks between 
you 
and the Israeli side? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that any talk of negotiations must be 
preceded with an agenda in which the settlement issue takes 
priority. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Do you mean that the issue of settlements 
should take a new form? 
  [Al-Husayni] It is no longer possible to defer the issue of 
settlements to the second phase; it must be discussed 
immediately. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] What will the next Palestinian step be 
following this dreadful massacre against worshipers in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque? 
  [Al-Husayni] If Israel wants to maintain the peace process, 
it must take these measures. On the negotiating level, we must 
start discussing the issue of settlers and settlement and 
immediately start to discuss the final solution. Second, Israel 
must take practical measures, including disarming settlers and 
evacuating the settlers from the areas that might cause 
provocation. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much, al-Husayni. 
  [Al-Husayni] My thanks to you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Palestinian leader in the </F>
occupied territories, by Umberto De Giovannangeli; place and 
date not given: "`They are Hunting the Arabs -- Israel Is 
Pretending Not To See'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA 
introduction] 
  [Text] "This is a tragic day, not only for the Palestinians 
but also for the entire peace process in the Middle East. When 
massacres like the one in Hebron take place, it means that there 
is increasingly less room for talks and then all hopes will 
vanish." Faysal al-Husayni does not hide his pain and anger. 
"What happened," he stressed, "is horrible not only because of 
the size of the massacre. Hundreds of unarmed people were there 
to pray and had entrusted themselves to the protection of the 
Israelis. The result is there for everybody to see. Now, do 
not tell me that this was the isolated act of a 'madman': It 
would be an offense against common sense and an insult to the 
memory of the victims. The evidence that we have collected is 
clear-cut: More than one person fired, an authentic commando 
that acted with lucidity and that had planned the criminal act." 
  [De Giovannangeli] At such a dramatic moment, what requests 
are you making to the Yitzhaq Rabin government? 
  [Al-Husayni] Words of condemnation do not help. Concrete 
acts that demonstrate the real willingness of the Israeli 
authorities to strike at the extremist colonists and the extreme 
right-wing Jewish groups are needed. We are asking for the 
immediate opening of an inquiry that will not merely shed full 
light on who the executors and the instigators of the massacre 
are, but that will also ascertain the responsibility of the 
Israeli military authorities who had to guarantee safety in holy 
places. This is only the first step; it should be followed 
immediately by others... 
  [De Giovannangeli] Which? 
  [Al-Husayni] Israel must acknowledge without reserve that 
the colonist movement is now a paramilitary organization that 
has chosen terrorism as its tool of political action. We are 
asking Rabin to ban these groups and to arrest the leaders who 
in these years, and even after the Washington accords, have 
acted undisturbed, openly disseminating proclamations of war, 
and organizing authentic "Arab manhunts." We are saying to the 
Israeli prime minister: Any further hesitation in acting 
against the terrorists of the settlements, any further 
postponement in the implementation of the Washington accords, 
could definitively cancel the positive things that have been 
constructed over the past months. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Is a ban on extremist groups sufficient 
to 
save the negotiations? 
  [Al-Husayni] It is the minimum condition, a basis for facing 
the issue in depth: the dismantling of Jewish settlements in 
Gaza and the West Bank. Rabin has always wanted to postpone 
discussions on this point, which is decisive for achieving real 
peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. After the 
Hebron massacre any delay in resolving this problem would sound 
like an objective act of complicity with the extremists. We 
know well that not all the colonists are terrorists, but we also 
know that -- and this fact certainly does not escape the Jewish 
military authorities -- that the settlements have now been 
transformed into operational bases for Israeli paramilitary 
groups: It is where they train themselves, it is where they 
keep large quantities of weapons. For this reason the 
settlements should be dismantled already during the transition 
phase. It is the mere presence of the colonists in the 
territories that creates tension and fuels violence. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In which terms does the Hebron massacre 
reintroduce the issue of safety in the territories? 
  [Al-Husayni] Israel has always seen this problem from a 
unilateral point of view, like a fact that concerned its 
citizens only. And this definition has weighed heavily upon the 
Taba negotiations. Rabin deceived himself by thinking that he 
could get everything and the opposite of everything: The accord 
with the PLO and the support, or at least the non-ostracism, of 
the colonists that have always supported the nontransferability 
of "Judea and Samaria." On the other hand, the Hebron massacre 
bears witness to the impossibility -- which moreover was 
repeatedly denounced by the PLO -- of entrusting the safety and 
the life of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to the 
Israeli troops. An immediate initiative by the United Nations 
is needed and in particular by the United States and Russia, the 
"cosponsors" of the negotiations on the Middle East: We are 
asking that the Palestinian population in the territories be 
placed under international protection until the withdrawal of 
the Israelis is completed. Only in this way can new massacres 
be avoided.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, left Cairo for 
Tunis this morning. 
  In a predeparture statement, he said he will participate in 
the PLO Executive Committee meetings to discuss the 
repercussions of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which he 
described as extremely serious. 
  We cannot imagine that the situation in the occupied 
territories will remain as it was before, he said. 
  Sha'th added: When we said that the real obstacle to peace 
is the settlements and the settlers, the Israelis insisted that 
Palestinian extremists, so they claim, are trying to abort the 
peace process. The massacre has shown who in fact is the 
aggressor and who is the victim. The settlement activity is a 
flagrant and continuing act of aggression; it is an illegitimate 
usurpation of the occupied territories and a Judaization of the 
land. 
  Sha'th stressed that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a 
major blow to the peace process and an attempt to foil it. 
  We will discuss how to protect the Palestinian people in 
light of the international developments, and we will ask the 
world to ensure international protection for the Palestinian 
people through use of UN forces and observers, Sha'th said. 
  He said the PLO will ask the world to force Israel to disarm 
the settlers. 
  For the peace process to move ahead, Sha'th said, protection 
and security for the Palestinian people must be provided until 
the Palestinian forces take over full responsibility for the 
usurped land. 
  On transferring the negotiations to Washington, Sha'th said 
this is not a magical solution following the massacre. He 
added: The Cairo negotiations were not the reason for the 
massacre; on the contrary, the Egyptian leadership hosted and 
greatly supported the talks, and we were close to signing an 
agreement and starting the Israeli withdrawal. I believe that a 
transfer of the talks will waste some time. 
  Sha'th said that the United States must pressure Israel to 
achieve a just peace with the Palestinians.

  [Excerpts] The PLO Executive Committee will hold a meeting 
in Tunis tonight in which the Palestinian delegations to the 
negotiations with Israel in Washington, Paris, Cairo, and Taba 
will participate. On the decisions and recommendations which 
are expected to result from tonight's meeting, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
political adviser to Yasir 'Arafat and the head of the 
Palestinian delegation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
on the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, gave the 
following exclusive statement to this program: 
  [Begin recording] [Sha'th] This is the first major meeting 
to 
be held since the terrible massacre perpetrated by the murderous 
Israeli settlers in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. The first 
responsibility of the PLO is to protect the Palestinian people. 
So we must discuss this subject in order to arrive at specific 
recommendations for providing protection for our people -- 
international protection and protection on the ground by the 
disarming of the settlers, the disarming of all the settlers, 
because without this protection cannot be provided for the 
Palestinian people. 
  In addition to this, we must also study the U.S. call for 
the 
negotiations to be held in Washington. We want to know what 
this call will add to the negotiations, how the change of venue 
will help to solve the problems facing the peace process, what 
role the United States will play in the coming negotiations, and 
at what level the negotiations will be. What are the main 
subjects -- will they include the protection of the Palestinian 
people or not? [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Dr. Sha'th, 
you have announced in statements to the press that future 
negotiations will focus basically on providing international 
protection for the Palestinian people so that what happened in 
Hebron will not recur. In your opinion what form should this 
international protection take? 
  [Sha'th] Many forms are known to the world. A few weeks ago 
a massacre occurred in Sarajevo in which the number of victims 
was similar to the number of Palestinian martyrs in the Ibrahimi 
mosque in Hebron. The result was a change in the international 
view of the Bosnian issue and of the protection required for the 
Bosnian people from the Serbs who were threatening the lives of 
the Bosnian Muslims daily. A minimum level of protection was 
provided which was not sufficient at all, but it was a minimum 
threat to the killers so that they would move their guns far 
from Sarajevo and protection would be provided for the Bosnian 
Muslims in Sarajevo. 
  There are international forces in Bosnia and in many other 
places -- Sinai, the Syrian-Israeli borders, the Lebanese 
borders, and others. The agreement we signed in Washington 
comprises suitable and agreed international protection. Until 
this moment Israel has been dragging its feet in discussing this 
item which provides for observers and international troops who 
will give the minimum protection, in addition to the Palestinian 
police who must replace the army of occupation when the latter 
withdraws. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faruq Qaddumi, identified by his </F>
nom de guerre Abu-al-Lutf, chief of the PLO Political 
Department, "conducted a short while ago" by unidentified 
reporter; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Faruq Qaddumi: Have you taken any 
steps that could be announced, or at least what is the current 
tendency? Would the talks be suspended? And would they be 
resumed if your conditions are met or if new bases are laid 
down? Will the PLO be satisfied with moving the talks to 
Washington, as President Clinton called for? 
  [Qaddumi] Moving the talks is not sufficient. The 
invitation, which is addressed to the PLO, seems to forget what 
took place yesterday. The crime perpetrated by Israeli hands -- 
through the army's collaboration -- cannot be forgiven. 
Decisive steps must be taken by the international community to 
stop such acts in the future. 
  They say that Israel is protecting its security. In fact, we 
are the ones who need security. Israel is the hotbed of 
tension; it is the one which is creating such problems and 
practicing terrorism in the region. Israel is a Nazi state, 
which is perpetrating massacres. This is a Palestinian 
holocaust. They say that they were treated unjustly in history, 
however, they are inflicting their injustice on others. 
  The United States comes to cover up this crime with its call 
for negotiations. This is not the issue. There should be 
international guarantees to protect our people inside the 
occupied territory. Defenseless people are facing this Israeli 
military warmarchine supplied to Israel by the United States. 
  [Reporter] We can understand from what you are saying that 
the Palestinian leadership is now discussing whether or not the 
talks will continue. It seems from what you said about Israel 
that it is difficult to resume the talks. 
  [Qaddumi] The continuation of the talks is difficult now. We 
accepted the call for peace, but Israel is practicing the 
opposite. It is practicing terrorism. How can a man hold talks 
under these circumstances. We recalled all our delegations here 
to Tunis. First, the Security Council must issue a resolution 
condemning Israel and take the necessary steps in this regard. 
The United States should take measures to protect our people 
through the Security Council and international forces. Steps 
also must be taken to dismantle these settlements. The United 
States is saying that these settlements are obstacle to peace. 
This crime proves that these settlements are obstacle to peace. 
Therefore, these settlements must be removed. Otherwise, what 
is the benefit of these talks? 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the resumption 
of 
talks now depends on the removal of the settlements? 
  [Qaddumi] This should be the case. We are holding talks with 
the United States and the Security Council. These settlements 
must be dismantled and the occupation should end. This is the 
cause of tension in the region. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf: We must be clear in the wake of the 
terrible massacre which took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque. Does 
this mean that you are suspending the talks with Israel, or will 
you discuss the issue of settlements and settlers during the 
coming talks? 
  [Qaddumi] First, the Security Council should issue a 
resolution. Then, the second step comes; namely, the removal of 
these settlements. If no measures are taken these negotiations 
will be meaningless. 
  [Reporter] Israel announced that it will take firm measures 
against settlers? 
  [Qaddumi] Let us see what are these measures which will 
really provide security and peace for our people. 
  [Reporter] Shim'on Peres announced that the negotiations 
should be rescued? How can this be done? 
  [Qaddumi] He himself should take measures, not the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Reporter] But he speaks about rescuing the negotiations as 
they are in a dilemma? 
  [Qaddumi] They are the ones whose positions have brought 
about this dilemma, from the Cairo agreement until today. Every 
day, they go back on what they wrote in this agreement and 
postpone withdrawal. All this means Israel does not want peace 
in the region. It wants to be rewarded for its occupation of 
Palestinian and Arab territories. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, this means all the basics on which 
the negotiations between you and Israel were initiated could be 
subject to review. 
  [Qaddumi] The negotiations cannot continue in this manner. 
The cosponsors of the conference, particularly the United 
States, should act as a sponsor that is not biased toward 
Israel. The weapons it gave to Israel are enough. It suffices 
that the United States says it wants to safeguard Israel's 
security. The Palestinian Arab people and the Arab people are 
the ones threatened by Israel because the latter is the hotbed 
of tension, and a factor of instability. No more lying to the 
world. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, the PLO calls for the sending of 
international forces to protect Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. A short while ago, Peres said he completely 
opposes this idea. 
  [Qaddumi] This means Israel does not want peace. The 
international community must decide, as it does in other 
international problems, to safeguard peace if today's world 
wants to establish stability and security in all the world's 
regions, including the Middle East. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, we know the atmosphere is tense 
after 
yesterday's massacre. How can one control the situation, 
security-wise, in the occupied territories? 
  [Qaddumi] This can take place by adopting speedy measures. 
First, the UN Security Council must not only condemn this crime 
but should take practical measures. The United States has to 
play a basic role in these measures. Israel, too, must respond 
to the international community's will by removing these 
settlements so that these terrorist acts do not recur. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, you are asking the international 
community, or the UN Security Council, to adopt practical 
measures. Give us an idea about these practical measures? What 
are you asking for? 
  [Qaddumi] First, international forces. Second, the removal 
of the settlements. Third, to expeditiously carry out 
withdrawal. Fourth, the United States must shoulder its 
responsibilities as a sponsor of the conference to have the 
peace process proceed on the road to eliminating the Israeli 
occupation. 
  [Reporter] These are the practical measures. However, 
during the meetings you are currently holding in Tunis, can you 
tell us about the atmosphere that prevails? 
  [Qaddumi] The atmosphere is very tense because this crime 
has 
exceeded all crimes. This is Palestine's holocaust, commited by 
the Israelis against the Palestinian people. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, do you have any new information 
about 
the way yesterday's massacre was committed? 
  [Qaddumi] The way in which the crime was committed is that 
while the worshipers were performing Friday prayers more than 
one settler came in. There were three groups. The settler was 
among them. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to have 
these great losses, more than 65 marytrs and 250 wounded. There 
were three groups. The permanent presence of the Israeli Army 
there helped these groups carry out their crime because they 
entered from three doors. But, this doctor of U.S. origin is 
the one who stepped ahead of the others and as a result of this 
was hit and killed. 
  [Reporter] Abu-al-Lutf, does this mean that the PLO directly 
accuses the Israeli Government and the Israeli Army and holds 
them responsible? 
  [Qaddumi] The Israeli Government is directly responsible for 
this crime. 
  [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. Faruq Qaddumi.

  [Text] To further clarify the picture of the contacts on 
negotiations, our news program has telephoned Faruq Qaddumi, 
head of the PLO Political Department, who spoke about the U.S. 
President's announcement of an expected Israeli-Palestinian 
meeting in Washington. 
  [Begin Qaddumi recording] In fact, yesterday's crime makes 
it 
impossible to think about the negotiations. Our delegations 
have been summoned from the committees and from the places where 
they hold negotiations. The issue now is not one of 
negotiations. It is a crime that has been committed against the 
Palestinian people, nay, against humanity. First, President 
Clinton should find a solution to this problem before he invites 
us for meetings to continue the negotiations. Ways and means 
must be forged to protect the Palestinian people. International 
resolutions must be adopted to condemn this heinous crime, in 
which scores were killed. The world must know that this state 
-- described as democratic -- is a false democracy. It is the 
source of anxiety and tension in the region, it is the hotbed of 
instability. Therefore, President Clinton should consider a 
solution to this problem before he invites us to such meetings. 
We are for peace and for the establishment of a just, durable 
peace. This crime has struck the peace process in the heart. 
This is because this is clear evidence that Israel does not 
want peace. [end recording] 
  On the Palestinian side, Faruq Qaddumi said: [Begin Qaddumi 
recording] We have asked the UN Security Council to adopt 
resolutions to protect the Palestinian people. We are demanding 
international forces to stop these massacres. We definitely 
know the international group will not hesitate at all to adopt 
the most stringent measures. Measures that clearly prove that 
Israel wants peace must be adopted. First, measures must be 
taken against Israel and against the perpetrators of this crime 
against humanity. Before anything else, the international group 
must not only condemn this, but make available means of 
protection for the Palestinian people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian negotiator </F>
to the Washington talks, in Tunis, by unidentified 
correspondent, in the studio, on 27 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, in Tunis; good 
evening. 
  ['Urayqat] Good evening to you. 
  [Correspondent] The government today decided to set up a 
state commission of inquiry on the tragic incident that took 
place in Hebron. A decision was also made ordering restrictions 
on the movement of Kakh activists and the release of around 
1,000 detainees. How do you react? 
  ['Urayqat] The decisions fall short of what the Israeli 
Government is required to do, especially given that it is aware 
of of the expectations of the Palestinian leadership. It must 
be made absolutely clear that negotiations cannot possibly 
continue for their own sake. Any negotiations in which the 
settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will 
be pointless. We had expected the Israeli Government to choose 
between peace and settlements. We had hoped the Israeli 
Government would order the complete disarming of the settlers, 
announce its acceptance of the idea of international protection 
for the Palestinians and a disbandment of the settlements in 
Gaza as a fist step. These resolutions are procedural and do 
not bear on the core of an issue that is closely bound up with 
the peace process. 
  [Correspondent] This evening, the Palestinian leadership is 
engaged in consultations following the tragic incident, 
especially as it may affect the peace negotiations. How does 
the Palestinian leadership plan to proceed on that score? 
  ['Urayqat] As I have said, the negotiations are not an end 
in themselves. Negotiations are to bring peace. The Israeli 
Government will have to choose between peace and settlements, 
since the two cannot go together; they are mutually exclusive. 
  The issue is far more serious than the Israeli or U.S. 
Administrations seem to think. The United States has ignored 
the core issue and focused on procedures like moving the talks 
to another site. Our opinion has been communicated to the U.S. 
Administration and the Israeli Government. The failure of the 
Israeli Government to make meaningful decisions does not bode 
well for the future. 
  [Correspondent] When do you think the PLO will decide its 
next move on the peace process? 
  ['Urayqat] I cannot say when. All I can tell you is that at 
2000 today the meetings will begin, with the participation of 
PLO Executive Committee members. All are now here, as are the 
heads of other negotiating teams. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli talks 
will stop? 
  ['Urayqat] The talks are already at a standstill. As you 
know, the Washington talks were supposed to go on until next 
Wednesday. As I have said, negotiations are not held for their 
own sake. The next move is now up to Rabin and the Israeli 
Government. They will have to choose between peace and 
settlements. 
  [Correspondent] Am I to take it, then, that the PLO wants to 
reopen the Oslo file? 
  ['Urayqat] Call it what you will. We are talking about an 
issue that has a direct bearing on our efforts to achieve peace. 
We are negotiating for peace. We have said time and again that 
settlements are a time bomb that may go off at any minute. One 
exploded on Friday. We cannot tell what will happen tomorrow, 
or the day after, or next month. The Israeli Government and the 
international community have a major responsibility on their 
hands -- the settlements and international protection for the 
Palestinian people. Again, negotiations in which the 
settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will 
be meaningless.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Hasan 'Asfur, deputy chairman 
of the Security Affairs Committee in the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on interim self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, has 
stated that international protection for the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories is a basic Palestinian demand and is again 
being raised now in an urgent way on the basis of the Oslo 
agreements between the PLO and the Israeli Government. 
  Commenting on the massacre that took place at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron yesterday morning in which scores of 
Palestinians were killed, 'Asfur told MENA that an executive 
mechanism must be worked out for an international presence in 
the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  He affirmed that the venue of the negotiations, whether it 
is 
Washington or any other place, is not a problem. The 
negotiations that took place in Taba and Cairo went well, 
particularly during the recent rounds. He noted that good 
progress was made in the last week of negotiations. The 
Palestinian delegation was anxious to reach an agreement to 
implement the self-rule plan as soon as possible. 
  'Asfur said that the massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque was 
carried out by a group of inhuman people. It was directed not 
only against the Palestinian people, but also against Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin personally and the Israeli 
Government. 
  He said that if Rabin and his government want the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles agreement, they must put a real end not only to the 
actions of these settlers but to the Israeli settlements and 
presence in the areas that will come under Palestinian autonomy. 
  'Asfur affirmed that what happened in Hebron proves that 
what 
is needed is not protection for the Israeli settlers but for the 
Palestinian people, because they are the ones facing danger from 
the Israeli settlers. 
  He expressed the hope that the Israeli Government will 
realize this and will adopt tangible measures to reduce, limit, 
and remove what could hamper the peace process.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hasan 'Asfur, "a senior member of </F>
the Palestinian delegation and one of the drafters of the Oslo 
and Cairo agreements," in Cairo; by Gay Bekhor on 25 February] 
  [Text] [Bekhor] What is your view of the massacre at the 
Cave of the Patriarchs? Who is to blame? 
  ['Asfur] Beyond the self-understood condemnation, the 
violent event at the Ibrahimi Mosque (the Cave of the 
Patriarchs) reflects the collective mentality of the settlers, 
and not only the individual mentality of the perpetrators. The 
settlers would like to ruin the process over which we have been 
toiling so hard. They are not a threat merely to the 
Palestinian people, they are a threat to all those who want 
stability in the region. 
  Basically, if Israel wants stability -- and it does -- the 
settlers are its enemies. The Israeli Government should 
therefore act against its enemies, hard as it may be. They are 
the ones who would like Israel to remain a ghetto in the region. 
They are a barbaric mob whose activities should be terminated. 
  [Bekhor] How should Israel put an end to the settlers' 
activities in the territories? 
  ['Asfur] I would place the emphasis on turning the settlers' 
acts into criminal offenses -- a criminalization of acts. That 
would mean that they should be tried genuinely, and not in the 
forgiving manner prevalent until now. They should be shown for 
the murderers and criminals that they really are. It is now up 
to Yitzhaq Rabin to prove that he can act, and not just express 
his regret and shame, as he told President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Bekhor] The Oslo agreement, the drafting of which you took 
part in, acknowledges the existence of settlements during the 
interim period. The agreement forbids you from arguing against 
them remaining in place at this time, and yet senior PLO 
officials are now calling for their removal. 
  ['Asfur] We agreed to the settlements remaining in place on 
the assumption that the settlers would be human, cooperate with 
the others, and that they would not pursue their activity which 
is barbaric and even worse, like that of animals. In the 
present situation, their presence has become a hazard and a 
threat. 
  [Bekhor] Do you intend to reopen the settlement clause of 
the Cairo agreement, as we have just heard? 
  ['Asfur] What happened in Hebron is a direct message to 
Yitzhaq Rabin to reconsider his security stands. As of now, he 
should think of more than the settlers' security; on the 
contrary, he should think of protecting the Palestinians. They 
are not the threat, they are themselves threatened. 
  Everything we have committed ourselves to is still firm and 
abiding and valid as far as we are concerned, and we will remain 
committed to it. But what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque will 
be tantamount to an Israeli violation of signed commitments, 
unless the matter is given genuine and serious attention. 
  [Bekhor] How will the Hebron massacre affect the 
continuation of the talks with your organization? 
  ['Asfur] The peace process is not a transient thing that is 
related to any one event. Anything can threaten the peace 
process. What is needed is a substantive change in the Israelis' 
political thinking. 
  [Bekhor] Why has the PLO called for international 
intervention? 
  ['Asfur] Our demand for international protection is not new, 
and the Oslo agreement validates it in a way. When we asked for 
international protection, the Israelis thought we were making 
slogans. Now they realize we meant it. 
  Who will protect the Palestinians? You? When a settler is 
killed, all Israel is in turmoil. You contact us demanding 
condemnation and even threatening us. But today, a condemnation 
by Rabin is not enough. 
  [Bekhor] What will happen when Palestinian rule is set up in 
the future? Will a similar event, in which Palestinians are 
murdered, suffice to ruin everything, or alternatively, will one 
Palestinian murderer killing settlers do it? 
  ['Asfur] The Government of Israel should start worrying now 
about the possibility of Israelis being murdered. We will be 
responsible for the security of Palestinians. In any event, if 
the Israeli Government intends to protect Israelis by 
perpetrating daily massacres against the Palestinian people, 
then peace will never materialize. 
  [Bekhor] What is your version of the chain of events during 
the Hebron massacre? 
  ['Asfur] The PLO has issued an official communique, and I 
refer you to it. I do not believe the Israeli version. Do you 
believe a single man could murder so many people, and without 
any intervention of Israeli soldiers to boot? It was all 
prearranged, and there was more than one killer.

while speaking to correspondent Michele Cucuzza on 25 February

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Hammad] The settlers are 
responsible for this tragedy. This time the Israeli Government 
must make the brave decision to disarm the settlers and to 
clearly state that the settlements are illegal, and these 
settlers must be told that this land is occupied territory. If 
the Israeli Government does not make this decision, the entire 
peace process could lose its credibility. This will not only 
give rise to extremism, but the peace process will be refuted: 
Even the moderates will decide that it is meaningless. [passage

  [Excerpts] Tunis, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) chief Yasir 'Arafat called the massacre of 52 
Palestinians in a Hebron mosque Friday a "serious blow" to the 
peace process. [passage omitted] 
  A member of the PLO Executive Committee, Jamal al-Surani 
called for the PLO to break off negotiations with Israel and for 
Arabs to unite against Israeli violence, the Egyptian news 
agency MENA reported. 
  The United Arab Emirates said the mosque killings 
demonstrated the "complicity" of the Israeli government. 
  "This savage killing, carried out under the eyes of the 
Israeli occupation forces, demonstrates the complicity of the 
Israeli government," the UAE news agency WAM quoted an official 
spokesman as saying. 
  The spokesman called on the UN and states sponsoring the 
peace process to take "firm and concrete measures to protect the 
Palestinians". He called for the "settlers to be disarmed, 
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to be dismantled 
so as to avoid a repeat of such killings". 
  Qatar called on Israel to carry out an official and "public" 
investigation into the massacre. 
  In London, Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin said 
the mosque shooting was "the most terrible thing that has 
happened to us in many years, but we hope it will not be a 
reason or pretext to put an end to the (peace) process." 
  He added: "What we have to do is to accelerate the 
process.... We hope the Palestinians will share with us this 
view despite this horrible event." 
  In Amman, the Jordanian branch of the Moslem Brotherhood 
fundamentalist organisation urged the Arabs to "pull out of the 
peace negotiations" with Israel. 
  The Moslem Brotherhood called on the "PLO leadership, the 
Arab countries, and in particular Jordan to withdraw from the 
negotiations," and appealed to the PLO "to return to the armed 
struggle." 
  Jordan has called for three days of national mourning 
starting on Saturday for those killed in Hebron. 
  Leaders of Christian communities in Jordan, quoted by PETRA 
NEWS AGENCY, also "firmly condemned" the killing and called for 
UN protection for the Palestinians. 
  The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians Patriarch Shanudah 
III likewise condemned the killing and urged Christians to 
consult the Moslems before making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to 
show solidarity with the Palestinians. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS has put all its 
fighters "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to 
retaliate as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in 
Hebron." [passage omitted] 
  Iran, which opposes the peace talks and backs Islamic 
militant groups, declared three days of mourning. 
  A group formed to oppose the autonomy accord, Black 
September 
13, vowed to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish 
institutions inside and outside the occupied territories" until 
the collapse of the self-rule deal.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Al-Baq'ah Camp--More than 3,000 people enraged by 
the news of the slaughter of at least 89 Palestinians at a 
mosque in Hebron early Friday [25 February] took to the streets 
of this sprawling [refugee] camp to demand revenge for the 
killings. 
  They also denounced the 27-month-old Arab-Israeli peace 
process and demanded that the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO) renounce its Sept. 13 autonomy agreement with Israel and 
leave the peace talks altogether. 
  Calls for retribution for the attack in the Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron, where an Israeli settler opened machine-gun fire on 
worshippers early Friday, were a dominant theme for a 
demonstration in this camp of nearly 100,000 residents. 
  "Where are you Saddam, where are your missiles," chanted the 
crowd, repeating after half a dozen masked youths perched atop a 
pickup truck mounted with loud speakers. They were referring to 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, who fired more than 40 long-range 
missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait. 
  For many residents of this squalid camp, President Saddam, 
despite Iraq's defeat in the war, remains a hero who was 
entrapped by the U.S. and other Israeli allies into a war aimed 
at eliminating Iraq's military power which they saw as a 
potential threat to the Jewish state. 
  "Would the Israelis dare to slaughter Palestinians if Iraq 
was as strong as it was before the war?" asked Husayn who wore a 
headdress to conceal his face. 
  The situation in al-Baq'ah appeared under control, but 
residents said emotions ran high and that they could not rule 
out individual acts of violence similar to an attack in downtown 
Amman where a British tourist was stabbed by a native of Hebron. 
  "People are enraged and seething with anger and frustration 
over their inability to do anything to avenge the killings," 
said an elderly grocer in al-Baq'ah. "Many people here are from 
Hebron and no doubt some of their relatives were among the dead 
and injured at Ibrahimi Mosque." 
  Black flags hung over electric poles and men and women 
gathered at street corners listening to radios and exchanging 
information to find out whether any of their relatives were 
among the victims of the attack. 
  Rejection of the peace talks with Israel was another 
dominant 
call of the protesters as they wound through the narrow streets 
of this camp, one of 11 camps housing nearly 300,000 Palestinian 
refugees in Jordan. 
  "No to peace and yes to the gun," they chanted, demanding an 
end to Palestinain participation in the peace negotiations. "No 
to self-rule, yes to holy war." 
  Despite the relative strength of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah among al-Baq'ah residents, many of those taking 
part in the protest said they felt the PLO-led peace talks with 
Israel were getting nowhere. 
  "As the talks get from one round to another, it is becoming 
increasingly clear that Israel has no intention of returning the 
land to us," said Walid Nash'at, who was seven when his family 
fled their home village in the West Bank in 1967. 
  "I supported the autonomy accord from the very beginning, 
hoping that it would lead to a just solution to our problems," 
said 'Amr, an electrician who declined to give his second name. 
  "But it seems that our problems are only getting worse, if 
Israelis can massacre Palestinians with impunity," he said. 
  Muhammad 'Uwaydah, an Islamic Action Front (IAF) member of 
Parliament from al-Baq'ah, told the rally: "Today's killing has 
proved that there cannot be any coexistence with Israel." 
  "I call on the Palestinian leadership to withdraw from the 
peace talks," he said as the crowd shouted: "Allahu Akbar" and 
"Jihad (holy war) is the only road to Palestine."

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Harun Hashim Rashid, alternate 
Palestinian delegate to the Arab League, today said that the 
emergency meeting that the Arab League Council will hold 
tomorrow night, Sunday, will focus on the developments in the 
region following yesterday's massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Rashid told MENA that the Palestinian delegation will call 
on 
the Arab League to take a unified stance in the face of repeated 
acts of aggression by the Israeli settlers and Army. The 
Palestinians will also urge international protection of the 
Palestinian people for security and stability to prevail and as 
a necessary condition for pursuing efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace, Rashid said. 
  Rashid said that the Palestinians will also call for the 
presence of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories 
to be reconsidered. He added that there is a need to remove 
these settlements because of the threat they pose to the peace 
process. 
  Answering a question about the massacre's effect on the 
peace 
talks between the Palestinians and Israel, which have already 
made significant progress, the Palestinian official said that 
such attacks certainly affect the peace process and demonstrate 
Israel's lack of credibility.

  [Text] Amman, Feb 25 (AFP)--Hardline Palestinian groups 
vowed on Friday [25 February] to carry out revenge attacks for 
the massacre of more than 50 Palestinians at a mosque in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas put all its fighters 
"on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to retaliate 
as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in Hebron." 
  In a statement to AFP here, Hamas said that "emergency 
military plans were put in place to strike at Zionist targets, 
occupation soldiers and settlers." 
  It also declared that the peace process had been dealt a 
"fatal blow" by the massacre. One or more settlers shot dead 53 
Palestinians and wounded dozens more inside a mosque at the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and eight other Arabs were killed 
in clashes with troops. 
  Hamas has been at the forefront of attacks on Jews in the 
occupied territories since the PLO signed its peace deal with 
Israel in Washington on September 13. 
  A group formed to oppose the deal, Black September 13, vowed 
to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish institutions 
inside and outside the occupied territories" until the collapse 
of the autonomy accord. 
  The attacks will take place in the next few days, said an 
anonymous caller to AFP in Beirut identifying himself as a 
member of the group. 
  From now on "all settlers are legitimate targets" for 
Palestinian militants, he added. 
  Black September leader Munir Maqdah, who is based in 
Lebanon, 
blamed Arafat's policies for the massacre and said that he "has 
no other choice to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide." 
  In Damascus, the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine, two hardline PLO groups, denounced the massacre as a 
"perfidious crime" committed with the knowledge of Israeli 
troops. 
  They promised the "martyrs and the people" that the FDLP's 
Red Star fighters and the PFLP's Red Eagles in the territories 
will take revenge against settlers and Israeli troops. 
  The PFLP called an emergency meeting of the Damascus-based 
"Alliance of Palestinian Forces" -- which includes the PFLP, the 
DFLP, and Hamas -- in order to decide how to respond. 
  Syria -- along with the PLO, Lebanon and Jordan -- is 
involved in the peace negotiations with Israel, but hosts the 
hardline groups as a means to pressure the Jewish state with 
whom it has made little progress in the talks. 
  Another group, the Revoltionary Army for the Liberation of 
Palestine, threatened to assassinate the PLO leader. 
  As the threats flew, 'Arafat said he had told his UN envoy 
to 
request an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council "so as 
to take the necessary measures to ensure the protection of our 
people." 
  "This massacre will have very serious fallout, not only on 
the (Israeli-Palestinian negotiations) but also at all levels 
and in all fields," 'Arafat added. 
  'Arafat accused the Israeli army of "complicity, adding "how 
can they allow settlers to bear arms and not our people?" 
  His organization declared three days of mourning and a 
general strike in the occupied territories. 
  The PLO's West Bank chief Faysal al-Husayni warned that "the 
peace process is dying." 
  Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and 
Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali both warned 
that the massacre threatened the negotiations. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin condemned the "odious 
massacre" and called on "Jews and Arabs to show restraint and 
not to become involved in provocative acts." 
  King Husayn of Jordan was among the leaders who joined the 
chorus of condemnation.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) 
Sunday [27 February] renewed a call on the mainstream Fatah 
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) to 
renounce the Middle East peace process and join hands to 
liberate Palestine through armed struggle. 
  "We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and 
escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an 
open letter signed by Hamas. 
  In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the 
occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the 
peace talks or face unspecified consquences. 
  Hamas is the largest religious-oriented group in the 
occupied 
territories challenging the domination of the PLO and Fatah, 
which is led by Yasir 'Arafat, who is also chairman of the PLO. 
  Hamas and Fatah, at two ends of political ideology, have 
been 
locked in a power struggle in elections to various Palestinian 
organisations and student unions in the occupied territries. 
  "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people 
died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed 
struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to 
live with our people in peace," said the statement. 
  In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to 
the 
Jordan Times, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond 
to this brotherhly and national call ... to abort the 
surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men." 
  Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through 
escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its 
earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow 
Palestinians. 
  In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with 
attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel. 
  "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate 
withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not 
allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiationbs 
with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people," 
said the letter. 
  The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the 
intifada and carry out revenege attacks against Israeli soldiers 
and settlers and engage in fights with them. 
  "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs 
and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent 
targets wherever they may be," read the letter. 
  The letter also called for demonstrations and marches 
throughout the occupied territories. 
  It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the 
Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it. 
  Salih Ra'fat, of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (DFLP) Sunday urged the PLO to freeze its negotiations 
with Israel. He also called on Mr. 'Arafat not to respond to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's call for a summit with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Washington. 
  Reports of such an invitation by Mr. Clinton were Saturday 
denied by a spokesman for Mr. Rabin, who said that the only 
invitation out of Washington was to lower-level peace 
negotiators to resume the talks. But other sources confirmed 
the invitation. 
  Mr. Ra'fat also called for the protection of the 
Palestinians 
in the occupied territories, the dismantling of settlements and 
the disarming of Jewish settlers. 
  Sulayman al-Najjab, member of the PLO Executive Committee, 
called for the suspension of the peace negotiations with Israel 
for the time being until they are preceded with conditions that 
are in line with international legitimacy.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Islamic Jihad Movement for the </F>
Liberation of Palestine--the al-Aqsa Battalions; in Amman on 25 
February] 
  [Text] The Islamic Jihad Movement for the Liberation of 
Palestine--the al-Aqsa Battalions announces its extreme 
rejection and denunciation of the appalling act and bloody 
massacre that took place at the Ibrahimi Mosque against 
innocent, defenseless monotheistic worshipers from among the 
sons our people in the occupied homeland. The movement stresses 
that this massacre by Israeli settlers took place in collusion 
with Israeli troops and the intelligence service. It coincided 
with the yesterday's [24 February] massacre when the Israeli 
Army waged a battle with rockets against Hamas fugitives in Abu 
Dis, near Jerusalem. The movement considers this massacre and 
this escalation a glaring violation of the Declaration of 
Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993 and the 
peace process. The movement holds the Israeli side and its 
political, military, and security leaders responsible for all 
the massacres, killings, and assassinations that are taking 
place against our Palestinian people. They are responsible for 
allowing settlers to carry the weapons that they aim at the sons 
of our people and use to commit massacres and killings. The 
movement views today's massacre, the collusion of Israeli troops 
in it, what happened in Abu Dis yesterday, and the earlier 
Israeli military escalation as an assassination of the peace 
process and sufficient justification for military escalation by 
all Palestinian resistance factions and for continued jihad and 
revolution against the nightmare of Israeli occupation. Our 
Palestinians will not forgive these massacres. God is great. 
Glory for the free mujahidin.

  [Text] Damascus, (SANA)--Ahmad Jabril, secretary general of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General 
Command [PFLP-GC], has said the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a 
natural extension of the Zionist enemy settler practices against 
our Palestinian people. 
  In a statement distributed here today, Jibril added that the 
savage massacre, which was perpetrated by the Zionist enemy 
against a gathering of Palestinian worshipers, is a fruit of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement that gave the settler Zionist enemy a 
short-cut to legitimizing its occupation of Palestinian Arab 
territories. 
  Jibril said: The determination of our Palestinian Arab 
people and Arab and Islamic nation will punish those who 
conceded our sanctities, territories, and history. He 
emphasized in conclusion that the Palestinian people inside the 
occupied homeland and in the diaspora will not forgive the 
killers their deed, and their revenge will be great. The savage 
massacre will increase our people's and our nation's firmness, 
determination, and confidence in the inevitable triumph.

  [Text] Reacting to the savage Zionist massacre, Mr. Ahmad 
Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], has said 
that there is nothing surprising in the Zionist acts of 
barbarity. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre will not be the last. 
It is a natural link in the chain of the Zionist enemy's 
actions against our Palestinian people, whose resolve to 
liberate their stolen homeland will never weaken in the face of 
the Zionist occupation and its tools of war, which are supplied 
by a U.S. Administration that cares only about its own interests. 
  The U.S. Administration's policies, now as in the past, show 
how biased it is to the Zionist enemy. This fact makes us 
certain that for Washington, Arab blood is not worth a drop of 
oil. The U.S.-sponsored rounds of negotiations over Arab 
rights, including Palestinian rights, only illustrate the 
solidity of the American- Zionist alliance, which is being 
joined by weaklings from our midst in a cheap transaction 
involving the homeland, the people, and sanctities. 
  The PFLP-GC secretary general's press statement added: The 
savagery committed by the Zionist entity against Palestinian 
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque is a corollary of the 
negotiations over blood, dignity, and rights. It is one of the 
fruits yielded by the Gaza-Jericho accord. This gave the 
Zionist entity a short cut to its goals and helped it legitimize 
its occupation of Palestinian Arab territory. It laid the 
groundwork for the gangs of killers and settlers to vent their 
hatred and Nazism against our people, whose only weapon is 
confidence in the inevitability of their triumph over this 
barbaric invasion. 
  We can only conclude from the incidents at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque that the real killers are those who encouraged the Jews 
and stretched out their hands to the enemy, who saw that its 
interests are being met by concessions from the 'Arafat 
leadership and certain Arab regimes who are playing the role of 
broker to promote mutual recongition and a settlement that by no 
means serves Arab or Islamic interests. 
  Jibril's statement added: The customary denunciations and 
condemnations by official Arab regimes will do nothing to dress 
our people's wounds nor restore their stolen rights, at a time 
when these regimes are working on opening up to the Zionist 
enemy and to their capitals becoming playgrounds for these 
vagabonds. 
  We in the PFLP-GC are aware of the scale of the conspiracy 
and what the forces of injustice, capitulation, and concessions 
are out to achieve. We are confident, therefore, that our 
Palestinian Arab people and Arab and Muslim nation will take 
revenge on those who have bargained away sanctities, land, and 
history. 
  Our Palestinian people inside the occupied homeland and in 
the diaspora camps will never forgive the killers their deed. 
Their retribution will be great. We are a nation of martyrs 
and martyrdom and have no fear of death. This horrible massacre 
will only serve to stiffen our people's and nation's resolve and 
boost their confidence in the inevitability of victory.

  [Excerpt] Damascus, 28 Feb (SANA)-- Dr. Talal Naji, 
assistant secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], has stated 
that the heinous crime in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron shows 
the Zionist enemy's hatred of the Arab and Islamic nation. 
  Interviewed by the newspaper TISHRIN today, Naji said that 
by 
this vile, hideous crime, the Zionists have proved their racist, 
Nazi, and fascist mentality. He demanded the world to uphold 
justice, human rights, and the right to self-determination. He 
expressed surprise that the United States was satisfied with the 
issuance of condemnation statements despite the ugliness of the 
massacre at a time when it would raise a hue and cry if the dead 
were Jews. He called on the international community to press 
for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories and to impose sanctions on Israel for not complying 
with the international legitimacy resolutions and charters. 
  Dr. Naji criticized Yasir 'Arafat for making concessions to 
Israel and said that 'Arafat's policy encourages the Zionist 
enemy and gives it the green light. [passage omitted]

  [Text] George Habash, secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has said the basic 
lesson learned from the black criminal act is the direct 
responsibility the leaders of Israel hold at a time when they 
are talking about peace and security. Habash also held the U.S. 
Administration responsible through its protection of Israel. 
Habash did not exempt Yasir 'Arafat and the Oslo-Cairo team, as 
he said, from responsibility through their signing of agreements 
that entrench the occupation and protect the settlements. 
  In a statement published in the Iraqi newspaper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH, Abu-al-'Abbas [Muhammad 'Abbas], secretary 
general of the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF], called for 
halting the negotiations with Israel and resuming armed struggle. 
  Through its official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawash, who spoke at 
a news conference, Hamas called on the PLO to return to its 
people. Hamas criticized the president of the PLO for continuing 
negotiations. Hamas reiterated its rejection of the Oslo-Cairo 
agreements and said these agreements maintain the settlements as 
time bombs that explode in the faces of Palestinians every day.

  [Text] Damascus, 25 Feb (SANA)--Nayif Hawatimah, secretary 
general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
has announced that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is the dirty and 
bloody fruit of the PLO agreement with Israel, which ignored and 
legalized the settlements in the occupied territories, and 
viewed these territories as disputed land. 
  In a press statement today, Hawatimah said PLO Chairman 
Yasir 
'Arafat should learn a lesson, cancel the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements, and return to national unity and consensus in 
accordance with international legitimacy. 
  Hawatimah said escalation of the intifadah to topple the 
Oslo 
and Cairo agreements opens the door for a political settlement 
based on withdrawal, the end of settlement construction and 
massacres, and securing the right to self-determination and 
independence. 
  In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary 
general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has come after the PLO and Israel 
signed the Gaza and Jericho agreement, which provided the enemy 
with a cover for its repeated crimes. 
  A statement issued by the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces 
said the atrocious crime is but the bloody fruit of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and a product of 'Arafat and his team's 
policy which submitted to all Israeli conditions. 
  The statement, issued following an extraordinary command 
meeting of the alliance, emphasized that the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement entrenched the Zionist occupation and accepted the 
continuation of settlements and settlers on our land and among 
our kinsfolk in order to kill and destroy.

  [Text] 25 Feb, (SANA)--Nayif Hawatimah, the secretary 
general of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
[DFLP] has denounced the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli 
settlers in Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today. In a press 
statement today, Hawatimah asserted that the crime will not go 
unpunished. He said that withdrawal of occupation forces from 
the occupied territory and giving the Palestinian people the 
right of self-determination will put an end to the tampering of 
the settlers and occupiers with Palestinian blood. 
  Earlier today, the DFLP called for general and comprehensive 
strike in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. 
  In a similar statement, Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, the secretary 
general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, said that the 
crime perpetrated by the Zionists in the Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn 
today is one of the most grotesque crimes against civilians in 
this age. The crime he said, is part of an Israeli scheme to 
terrorize and expel our Palestinian people from the occupied 
territory. He called on the UN Security Council and all world 
states to take measures to ensure the Zionists will not commit 
massacres against the Palestinian people. 
  The Palestinian Forces Alliance leadership has issued a 
statement in which it denounced the mosque massacre and called 
for escalating the intifadah against the occupiers and unify the 
ranks of our people in and outside of the occupied territory to 
confront the crimes of the occupation and the settlers. 
  The statement, which was issued following an emergency 
meeting held by the alliance to discuss the massacre, appealed 
to peoples of the world and international organizations and 
establishments to put an end to the Zionist arrogance and the 
settlers' recklessness and tampering with Palestinian blood. 
  The statement called for a general strike and national 
mourning for the martyrs in the massacres and saluted the 
steadfast people in the occupied territory who came out in 
Hebron, Nazareth, and the Golan to confront the enemy forces.

  [Text] Amman, 27 Feb (PETRA)--Salim al-Za'nun, acting 
speaker of the Palestine National Council [PNC], has condemned 
the abhorrent crime against worshippers at Hebron's Ibrahimi 
Mosque. He held the Israeli Government fully responsible for 
this criminal act perpetrated by malicious Zionist settlers in 
collaboration with regular Israeli military forces. 
  In a statement issued today after a meeting held by some PNC 
members in Jordan, al-Za'nun added that the criminal practices 
against our people's masses in the occupied homeland are a 
natural result of the occupation and the Israeli settlements 
that are spread throughout the occupied territories. 
  He demanded the dismantlement and removal of the settlements 
and the repatriation of the settlers. He also demanded the full 
withdrawal of the occupation army from occupied Palestinian 
territories, including holy Jerusalem. Al-Za'nun called for 
offering help and support to the steadfast kinsfolk in the 
occupied homeland and for holding a PNC session.

  [Excerpt] Amman -- 'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central Committee 
member, and secretary of the Higher Intifadah Committee, has 
said that military operations will be carried out against the 
settlers and Israeli occupation forces in reply to the odious 
massacre the killer settlers committed under the protection of 
the forces of occupation. He stressed this odious crime will not 
go unpunished. 
  'Abbas Zaki told AL-DUSTUR this massacre is within the 
framework of the Israeli scheme to use terror operations similar 
to those committed in Dayr Yasin to empty Hebron of its 
inhabitants. He added: Not content with its crime in Hebron, 
the enemy tried to commit another massacre during prayer in a 
mosque in Sa'ir at noon yesterday. 
  'Abbas Zaki said: From this premise, we insist on removing 
these settlers and setting a timetable for dismantling the 
settlements. He said: The slogan should be the West Bank and 
Gaza first and not Gaza-Jericho first, and international 
legitimacy resolutions should be implemented. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Political statement issued by the Fatah Central </F>
Committee;" place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Fatah Central Committee held an emergency 
meeting yesterday morning to discuss the serious dimensions of 
the abhorrent bloody massacre perpetrated by the Zionist 
settlers against Palestinian worshipers at dawn prayers in the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque in occupied Hebron, in which over 50 were 
martyred and hundreds wounded. 
  The Fatah Central Committee would like to emphasize the 
following: 
  1. This new ugly Zionist crime clearly reveals the true 
nature of the racist Zionist grudge and the Zionist enemy's 
practices and massacres against our Palestinian and Arab people 
in Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibya, Nahhalin, Sabra, Shatila, 
South Lebanon, the Golan, 'Uyun Qara [Rishon LeZiyyon], and 
al-Aqsa Mosque. This ugly crime clearly confirms the role and 
function of the Zionist entity, which is weighing heavily on the 
land of Palestine and which is seeking through all hostile and 
racist means to uproot our people from their homeland as a 
prelude to Judaizing the land of Palestine and ending the 
national identity of our Palestinian people. 
  2. This criminal bloody massacre is the first fruit of the 
treasonous agreement 'Arafat and his Zionized team signed with 
the enemy. It is a natural result of capitulation, submission, 
and normalization with the Zionist enemy. The enemy practices 
against our people and nation have been further confirmed by its 
crime in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. This clearly proves that 
there could be no peace or reconciliation with this Zionist 
entity. 
  3. While we hold the Zionist enemy and its leadership and 
settlers fully responsible for this heinous crime, we hold 
'Arafat and his Zionized team responsible for the blood of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque martyrs and wounded. 
  O masses of our Palestinian people, O masses of our Arab 
nation: 
  By this crime, the enemy sought to extinguish the spirit of 
revolution and valiant intifadah of our people in the occupied 
homeland, who reject the 'Arafatist treasonous agreements. It 
also sought to bring about the surrender of our struggling 
masses, which insist on maintaining confrontation with the 
enemy. The enemy targets, however, have foundered on the rock 
of the spirit of struggle and confrontation which manifested 
itself immediately after the early news of the Zionist crime. 
Popular anger swept through the entire Palestinian territory in 
the form of clashes with the Zionist enemy through which our 
struggling people emphasized that the spirit of struggle and 
resistance is always glowing and that their insistence on 
continuing their confrontation with the enemy and toppling the 
treasonous agreements and liquidatory plans cannot be stopped by 
the continuing Zionist massacres and repressive acts in the 
occupied homeland.

  [Text] Amman -- The Fatah Liberation Movement in Hebron has 
called on the Palestinian command to immediately suspend 
negotiations with the Israeli Government at all levels until the 
settlers are removed from the occupied territories. The 
movement also announced the cancellation of the cease-fire 
between its combat groups and the forces of occupation, and 
herds of settlers and the resumption of operations against them. 
  The movement called on the strike forces to escalate the 
intifadah against the settlers and the army forces at all times 
and to consider any settler who passes in Hebron streets as a 
target for our strike forces. 
  The movement also called on national institutions and 
figures 
to halt all forms of contacts with the departments of the 
military governor in Hebron, and held the Rabin government 
responsible for preparing and implementing the horrendous crime 
perpetrated by the settlers under the protection of the 
occupation forces.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Fatah 
representative in Cairo, has told MENA that the number of 
Palestinians martyred by the Israeli massacre in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron and the subsequent incidents in the rest of 
occupied territories has risen to 91 with more than 500 others 
wounded. 
  Al-Qidrah explained that 79 martyrs and 256 wounded fell in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque and in the city of Hebron alone as a result 
of bullets fired by the Israeli occupation forces against the 
Palestinian masses who came out to rescue their kinsfolk from 
the massacre. 
  He added that six martyrs fell in Gaza and 70 were wounded, 
65 were injured in the al-Aqsa Mosque area in Jerusalem, one 
martyr fell in Nabulus and several were wounded, one martyr fell 
in Tulkarm and several were wounded, and several people were 
wounded in Ramallah and Jericho. 
  The Palestinian official added that one person was martyred 
in Bethlehem and 12 were wounded, most of them natives of Bayt 
Jala, a town with a Christian majority. In the Qalandiya 
township three martyrs fell and several people were wounded. 
  Al-Qidrah announced that he conveyed messages today from 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to al-Azhar Imam Shaykh 
Jad-al- Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, Awqaf Minister Muhammad 'Ali 
Mahjub, and His Holiness Coptic Pope Shanudah III explaining to

Mosque in Hebron, which later spread to the rest of the occupied 
territories.

Jad-al- Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq informed al-Qidrah that prayers 
for the martyrs' souls will be said in Egypt's mosques.

be celebrated for their souls in Egypt's churches tomorrow, 
Sunday.

  [Text] Amman -- Well-informed Palestinian sources have 
stated that several Fatah leaders and cadres are holding 
consultations among themselves to convene Fatah' Revolutionary 
Council to discuss the situation in the Palestinian arena in 
light of the recent developments in the occupied territories and 
the bloody massacre committed by the Rabin government against 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  A Fatah source told AL-DUSTUR that there are undeclared real 
divisions in the Fatah Movement ranks, the most acute of which 
is that the Fatah command outside the territories has lost 
control over the Fatah strike forces in the occupied territories 
which call for suspending the negotiations with Israel. 
  The sources added that several Fatah military officials 
might 
announce stands completely different from Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat's stands if the Revolutionary Council does not 
convene.

  [Text] Nicosia, 25 Feb (INA) -- The Arab Liberation Front 
[ALF] has denounced the horrendous, racial crime that claimed 
the lives of dozens of martyrs as they were performing prayers 
this morning at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. An ALF spokesman 
said the outrage only demonstrates the spiteful nature of the 
aggression against our people and our nation under the cover of 
the new world order. Some who are worn out by the struggle and 
dazzled by the deceptive sparkle of power rushed to make peace 
with the enemy and recognized its presence on our usurged 
territory, the spokesman added. 
  This ghastly crime and other Zionist atrocities have in 
common the objective of controlling Arab territories and 
eliminating their owners by expulsions or killings. Only its 
scale sets this latest crime apart from previous outrages, the 
spokesman noted. 
  We in the ALF denounce the West's collusion with the 
Zionists 
and their condoning of crimes against our people. We denounce 
the flagging resolve of the godfathers of a settlement with this 
usurper Zionist entity, and reiterate our outright rejection of 
all forms of settlements with this racial and usurper enemy. 
  We urge all Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw 
from 
the talks and rejoin the struggle in all its forms, most of all 
armed struggle, as the only option to liberating our land and 
safeguarding the dignity and life of the Arab individual. 
  The spokesman called on the Arab nation and its nationalist 
forces to speak up against Arab regimes associated with 
imperialism and who compromise Arab rights and gamble with the 
future of the Arabs. 
  The spokesman said in conclusion: The Arab masses and the 
Palestinians in particular must sit in the trench of the Mother 
of Battles -- the trench of justice and dignity that leads to a 
bright and prosperous future.

  [Text] Damascus, 27 Feb (SANA)--The Political Bureau of 
the Palestinian People's Party [PPP] has demanded a halt to the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations until international protection 
is provided for Palestinian citizens in reply to the heinous 
massacre perpetrated at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque where innocent 
worshipers from the Palestinian people's sons fell as victims. 
  In a statement issued here today, the PPP held the Israeli 
Government responsible for the massacre. This government 
facilitated the building of settlements for these criminals, 
armed them, and was lenient toward their previous crimes, such 
as what happened with the perpetrators of the al-Aqsa Mosque and 
the Hebron university massacres. 
  The PPP added that the Israeli Government cannot guarantee 
the Palestinian citizens' security. In fact, it joins in 
inflicting more Palestinian casualties and punishes their 
kinsfolk by firing at them and imposing collective punishments 
on them. 
  The PPP pointed out that such a situation cannot help 
achieve 
peace. It demanded that negotiations should be suspended until 
fair conditions conforming to the resolutions of international 
legitimacy are in place.

issued as statement, which said: The Zionist enemy forces 
perpetrated an abhorrent crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque, adding a 
fresh outrage to its long list of crimes to promote its 
genocidal policy against our Arab people and liquidate their 
national cause. 
  This new Zionist crime is a natural corollary of the 
capitulatory agreement signed by 'Arafat with the Zionists in 
Oslo and Cairo and a consequence of the policies of 
relinquishment and capitulation pursued by 'Arafat and his 
deviationist methods. 
  We promise our people to remain faithful to our cause and 
national struggle and the martyrs' blood until all Palestinian 
territory is liberated.

  [Text] Damascus, 25 Feb (SANA)--Khalid al-Fahum, head of 
the Palestinian National Salvation Front has condemned the 
barbaric aggression against Palestinian worshipers in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque at dawn today, which emphasizes the 
aggressiveness of Israel and extremist Zionist forces. 
  In a press statement, al-Fahum said we emphasized more than 
once the importance of coordination with all Arab countries, 
especially Syria, in order to attain the just and comprehensive 
peace we want. However, the PLO's influential leadership 
continues to offer concessions to an enemy that does not want 
peace, but works to impose capitulation on the PLO. 
  Al-Fahum urged the PLO leadership to stop its policy of 
relinquishment and to cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements so it 
will be able to work for Palestinian national unity and to 
restore coordination with the Arab countries, especially Syria, 
and to continue the struggle to attain the Palestinian people's 
right to return, self-determination, and to set up their 
independent state on their national soil.

The injustice, killings, and displacements that have been 
taking place in Palestine for decades and that climaxed in the 
killing and wounding of hundreds of worshipers at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque clearly shows that Jews are Jews and that their hate for 
Muslims is intense and their resentment of God and his messenger 
is ever deepening. This should have been an eye opener for the 
heedless and fools who are bargaining Palestine away, giving it 
up chunk by chunk, city by city, and facility by facility. 
  The Bayt al-Maqdis Movement concluded its statement by 
saying: Relief is not far off and the outlines of victory are 
apparent on the horizon and God is great.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Brothers! The massacre at the al-Ibrahimi mosque at 
dawn today opens the gates to major questions relating to the 
entire peace process. Are we proceeding along the correct path? 
Or is there something else that ought to be seen, studied, and 
paused at? This is because with such a terrible murder that our 
people were subjected to today, we cannot be assured of a future 
without guarantees that will insure that our murder will not 
become a daily annihilation. 
  Perhaps one of the most important and prominent questions 
concerns the settlers and the settlements, and whether a 
practical consolidation of any agreement could be realized if 
the settlers were living round the towns, villages, and the most 
important Palestinian housing concentrations? Everyone knows 
that the settlements that were built in the West Bank and Gaza 
since 1967 were established on military bases; the aim was that 
they should encircle the Palestinians, surrounding them with a 
military belt in which zealous settlers, who are trained in the 
use of arms and had served in the Israeli Army, live. 
Therefore, there is a gross malfunction in the negotiations 
that basically relate to the settlements and the settlers. 
  It is quite true that the Oslo and Washington agreements do 
not place the matter along these lines, but today's massacre 
gives a clear signal that there can be no solution with the 
presence of the settlers, and that the problem of the 
settlements should jump the list to become the priority over all 
other issues. This is because the Palestinians cannot have 
security while the settlers are there, and cannot feel safe 
while the settlements are present. Today's massacre is terrible 
and atrocious to the extent that it cannot be tolerated. It 
does not only give rise to questions, but raises the issue of 
protecting our people, and gives pause to the entire world -- 
especially the two cosponsors, the Russians and the Americans -- 
and the Security Council and the United Nations questions 
regarding the presence of an international force to protect our 
people -- forces that separate this unarmed people and the 
settlers, who this morning fired the signal of the beginning, 
that was received by the Israeli Army who indulged with the 
settlers in the killing of the sons of our people. 
  We ought to understand the massacre, not only as an 
atrocious 
and mass crime, but as an early declaration of Israeli 
intentions regarding their belief in peace. Those who allow all 
those killings, and those who participate in such murders, 
cannot have a definite intention to strive for peace. This, now 
more than ever before, make our people and the PLO pause at our 
security and the guarantees that are being offered by the world 
for this security. The entire world has celebrated the accord of 
principles that was signed in Washington. What does the world 
say about this massacre and these killings? How can the world 
guarantee for us that such a massacre will not be repeated? How 
can this world punish the Israeli Government, Israeli Army, and 
Israeli settlers? The United Nations and the Security Council 
and all the states are now called upon to adopt a clear 
attitude. 
  The Security Council, which in recent years has become an 
establishment for intervention in the explosive spots in the 
world, should take practical resolutions and steps to protect 
the Palestinian blood. We will not list the issue under the 
title: Settler or settlers? The issue is not like that. The 
Israeli Army was not only responsible, but was the one who 
carried out the massacre. The Israeli prime minister, who at 
the same time is the well-known general who broke the 
Palestinians bones, is also totally and practically responsible. 
Matters will not be rectified in this way. Negotiations could 
not be continued, not only as a protest, but because of the 
bigger question of whether such negotiations and the results 
they may reach are worthwhile if the beginnings witness such 
terrible massacres? It is a black day in the history of our 
people. It is a bloody day, a day when they violated our 
sanctities in a holy month and killed and slaughtered; a day 
when blood smeared the walls of the al-Ibrahimi mosque while 
they went on in their celebration of our murder. How can murder 
lead to peace? We ought to stop and not proceed along the path 
of negotiation without being assured that the mowing down by 
bullets of innocent worshipers who were kneeling in prayers to 
their God would not be repeated, even if it was individual 
killing. How about their ugliness and racialism? 
  Then there is a last question that the massacre raises. Is 
the Arab situation in need of a bigger reconsideration in order 
to become more solid and firm? Is such solidarity still a 
costly demand, while the massacres fully expose the facts before 
the Arab world? Is there anyone who is safe from danger and 
threats while the life, security, and safety of the entire 
region are in a most critical situation?

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>
  [Text] Brothers: There is no doubt that the hideous crime 
perpetrated by a clique of Zionist settlers, in collaboration 
with Israeli military commanders, against our people in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is a natural outcome of the 
continuation of occupation and the continuation of genocide 
against our steadfast people in the occupied homeland. Within 
this context, the crime puts the peace process at a serious 
crossroad. This requires urgent measures to uproot its causes. 
  The ugly crime -- in which many martyrs and injured fell at 
the hands of the herds of settlers who enjoy official Israeli 
protection and support -- shows that peace will remain fragile 
as long as the settlements are still there and as long as the 
herds of settlers do whatever they want, carry out systematic 
killing against our people, and encroach on their sanctities in 
front of the international community which is turning a deaf ear 
to its own calls on human rights and liquidation of colonialism. 
  The crime, which has shaken the conscience of official and 
popular world public opinion, [break in transmission for 3 
seconds] just denunciation, condemnation, and regret. It is a 
warning to all those who are involved in the peace process to 
review their stands and prove their credibility toward the 
Palestinian people and their legitimate rights to their land and 
homeland. 
  What took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque was not an accident, 
but an organized crime for which the Israeli leadership -- which 
is still alleging that it is concerned about security and peace 
in the region -- is responsible. It is an ugly crime in which 
the Palestinian blood was shed to put everyone to the test, 
particularly the United States in its capacity as the main 
sponsor of the peace process. The crime has dealt a severe blow 
to this process and warns of dangers whose future dimensions 
cannot be predicted. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque crime shows the consequences of not 
providing international protection for the Palestinian people 
under the yoke of occupation. This issue does not tolerate any 
indifference or postponement under the pretext of giving the 
Israeli authorities enough time to look into the matter. 
Experiments showed that the Israeli authorities only aim at 
repressing and annihilating the Palestinians. They are far away 
from the truth regarding their claims to provide them with 
security and safety. Colonialists are only concerned about 
their own security, entrenching their occupation of land, 
annihilating its people. 
  It is time for the international community, particularly the 
Security Council, to look into the bare facts and take urgent 
measures to provide international protection for the Palestinian 
people. It is also time for the United States -- if it is 
really interested in rendering the peace process a success -- to 
practice its influence on the Isareli leadership to bring it to 
the right path. The Palestinian people have made great 
sacrifices, but they never weakened. Palestinian blood was 
never cheap and will never be so.

  [Text] O our heroic Palestinian people, o brothers of the 
martyrs of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, o their sons and beloved 
ones, o their relatives, o brave men of the giant intifadah, o 
brave Palestinians in all arenas of struggle, confrontation, 
clash, and conflict: It was our blood that was shed 
treacherously in the houses of God. It calls you, your unity 
and cohesion, your national identity, your national affiliation, 
your awareness and understanding and it urges you to rise up as 
one man to achieve the great goal of expelling the hateful 
Zionist occupation and its dark age from our country so our 
people can enjoy freedom and independence. 
  Let us all chant our historic slogan: "All rifles should be 
directed against the enemy, and all efforts and energies should 
be mobilized to fight the enemy, which is seeking to destroy our 
life and future." 
  Let each one act from his position to confront the army's 
occupation and the hordes of its settlers. Let a new wave of 
our brave intifadah move in one national voice and one combat 
spirit. This time is no longer one for differing slogans and 
speeches. Rather, it is one for a unified national action, which 
allows only for different actions. 
  Yes, this is a time for a unified national action and this 
is 
a time for a national unity to protect the lives of our people 
and bring double retaliation to the murderers, the hordes of the 
Zionist settlers, and the occupation army and authorities that 
protect these murderers. Let us work in the arenas of struggle, 
conflict, and confrontation as one unified rank and let us all 
chant in one voice: Either freedom and independence or fighting. 
Long live Palestine free, Arab, and Palestinian.

Society in Amman on 26 February to offer condolences for the 
victims of the Ibrahimi Mosque attack in Hebron -- recorded] 
  [Text] All of us here share the pain, sorrow, and sadness 
toward a heinous crime, the most heinous crime one can imagine 
could happen. This crime happened yesterday, Friday, at dawn, 
in this blessed month and in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Those who passed away to meet with God the almighty are 
among 
the righteous martyrs and chaste ones. This consoles us and 
eases our pains. Here, in this gathering and in this mosque, 
and in any gathering that brings us together with kinsfolk and 
brothers who are joining us in the one objective and genuine 
Arab march, we are not meeting as officials and citizens. In 
fact, we are meeting as brothers and kinsfolk, and as members of 
one family. We all assume our responsibilities now and in the 
future, hand in hand, brothers on the path of right and success, 
God willing. 
  From this place, and on behalf of all my kinsfolk, brothers, 
and beloved ones, we emphasize to the kinsfolk, the brothers, 
and beloved ones in Hebron and in all the other occupied 
Palestinian territories, that we are with them, not only in 
these moments but in every moment in this life, in terms of 
patience, endurance, adherence to the land, defense of justice, 
and confidence in the inevitable triumph of justice in the long 
run. 
  We are with the kinsfolk under hard circumstances and in 
confronting the continuing crucial test and suffering. We are 
with them with all of our resources and capabilities, the 
brothers, kinsfolk, and beloved ones who are the families of the 
martyrs and wounded, who fell as victims of this heinous crime.

<F P=106> [Speech by Jordan's King Husayn during a visit to the Hebron </F>
Charity Society in Amman on 26 February to offer condolences for 
the victims of the Ibrahimi Mosque attack in Hebron--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Think not of those who are slain in God's way as 
dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence 
of their Lord. [Koranic verse] 
  My presence and that of the brothers here among you, our 
dear 
kinsfolk, our men and enduring ones--knowing that we have always 
been one family--is something natural. [passage omitted] 
  We previously talked about the issue of religious 
jurisdiction and the need to focus on this dimension. Thus, as 
far as the Islamic holy places and other places and our 
sanctities are concerned, jurisdiction should be the 
responsibility of the Islamic nation as a whole. This talk was 
a responsible and objective one. 
  I believe that the sad and tragic chain, including setting 
fire to the al-Aqsa Mosque, repeatedly encroaching on the 
Christian holy places, and yesterday's tragedy, is clear proof 
that we can only continue to demand that this religious 
sovereignty be that of God the almighty alone, and also of his 
worshippers who are able to protect their holy places and who 
can vie with one another for the fear and respect of God. 
  O kinsfolk and brothers, be sure that we will work to the 
best of our ability, so heads will remain raised and will only 
bow to God the almighty. We will defend justice, and, as 
always, we will have solid positions in the face of any 
manifestations by some to disregard our right, the right of our 
kinsfolk and brothers on their national soil. 
  There was much talk about peace. We sincerely and honestly 
proceeded toward peace. However, it should be an honorable and 
just peace which will be accepted by the coming generations. It 
is not, and will not be, capitulation. 
  God knows the magnitude of the pressures we are facing. You 
are well aware of the challenges and dangers we faced in the 
past and which we are facing now with clear vision and 
cooperation. We are the pioneers of those who call for Arab 
convergence, cooperation, fraternity, honesty, and good faith, 
and we will continue to be so. O kinsfolk, brothers, and dear 
ones, be sure that had I personally been an obstacle to this 
Arab convergence, I would not have remained one moment in this 
position. [applause] 
  This speech is not a new one. Many fraternal Arab leaders 
heard this speech years ago. However, we will renew the call 
for convergence and cooperation in fulfillment of the duty 
toward the coming generations. We only seek to satisfy both God 
the almighty and our conscience. Here, with reason, awareness, 
and the insistence on controlling our nerves more than before. 
[sentence as heard] We should also organize our ranks, endure, 
and be ready to bear more pressures. [We should maintain] the 
splendid picture which used to be, and which will continue, of 
this (?one) family in order to face the challenges and fate of 
this universe. Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, 
but help ye not one another in sin and rancor. [Koranic verse] 
  God bless you all. May God grant us strength to endure his 
will. We have not forgotten for a single moment the kinsfolk and 
brothers, nor will we forget for one moment our duties toward 
them. We will optimally do what we can, with God's help. May 
you be safeguarded by God, the protector of the march. God the 
almighty is the one who grants success. We hope we will 
constantly meet in better circumstances than these ones. 
  Once again, we all extend to the dear and beloved kinsfolk 
and brothers in Hebron much love, appreciation, and pride in 
their steadfastness. We also extend all sentiments of sharing, 
which we will embody to the best of our ability at present and 
in the future, and under all circumstances, in terms of bearing 
what they have endured and facing what they continue to endure. 
We are with them, with God's help. May God's peace, mercy, and 
blessings be upon you.

  [Text] Jordan has denounced the criminal act that was 
carried out by one of the settlers against innocent Muslim 
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron 
at dawn today. Hundreds of Palestinian citizens were murdered or 
wounded in this act. 
  In a statement to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali described what happened at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque as an unprecedented crime, and as an indication of 
fanaticism, extremism, and lack of respect for human rights and 
sanctities. 
  Dr. al-Majali said that this criminal act constitutes a huge 
obstacle on the road to achieving a just and comprehensive 
peace, which Jordan has been tirelessly seeking to achieve. He 
stressed the need for a full Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories and for the removal of settlements as 
a guarantee to prevent the recurrence of such criminal acts that 
are in conflict with all humanitarian and religious values. 
  Dr. al-Majali said: At this time, when our region is 
witnessing immense events, we are in a dire need for a unity of 
stands and ranks on the Arab and Islamic levels in order to be 
able to confront challenges. 
  In his own name and on behalf of the Jordanian Government, 
Dr. al-Majali extended condolences to the Palestinian leadership 
and to our people in the occupied territories. He said: We 
consider the misfortune of our people in Palestine as our own 
misfortune.

  [Text] In a statement made earlier today to Jordan 
television's live program "Good Morning Jordan," Talal Sat'an 
al-Hasan, Jordanian minister of state for foreign affairs 
denounced the painful, criminal incident in the Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron. [video first shows picture of al-Hasan then clips 
from program] 
  [Begin al-Hasan recording] First of all, I wish to express 
the Jordanian Government's strong condemnation of the criminal 
massacre committed this morning against innocent, unarmed 
Palestinian citizens inside the Ibrahimi Mosque, a house of God, 
and one of the most sacred places for the Muslim nation. This 
condemnable crime, committed against worshipers in the middle of 
Holy Ramadan, has shaken us and every single Arab, Muslim, and 
individual in the world. It should not be allowed to go by as a 
passing incident. The world must view it as a result of the 
arming of fanatical settlers. Jordan has always warned against 
the serious consequences that arming settlers would have on the 
peace process. Israel, the world, and the international 
institutions must bear their responsibilities and immediately 
act to put an end to the terrorist acts of the settlers. This, 
of course, means that, first, these criminals must be punished 
and that they be disarmed to prevent such incidents in the 
future, and even the removing of settlements all together from 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  As we extend to our kinsfolk in occupied, steadfast Hebron, 
and to the families of the martyrs our warmest condolences, we 
in Jordan warn the world that this incident and several others 
in the past only exemplify the consequences of the occupation of 
the Palestinian territory and the prevention of the Palestinian 
people from exercising theirs right on their soil. The world 
must bear the responsibility to stop these incidents by ensuring 
the achievement of an honorable, comprehensive settlement that 
will lead to Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian 
and Arab territories and granting the Palestinian people their 
legitimate rights. [end recording]

  [Text] As soon as it received word about the criminal 
incident against innocent, defenseless Palestinian citizens in 
the holy Ibrahimi mosque at dawn today, the Jordanian Government 
held intensive contacts with Arab, Islamic, and friendly states, 
and with international organizations, to express its strong 
denunciation and condemnation of this incident. In its 
contacts, the Jordanian Government held Israel responsible for 
the incident and its consequences. It urged the international 
community to assume its responsibilities toward putting an end 
to such acts that desecrate holy places, terrorize secure 
citizens, and escalate violence. 
  In this context, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for 
foreign affairs, summoned separately the ambassadors of the UN 
permanent member states -- the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France, China, and Russia -- the ambassador of Greece, 
in its capacity as the current chairman of the European Union, 
and the ambassador of Indonesia, the current chairman of the 
Nonaligned Movement, to his office in the Foreign Ministry. He 
conveyed to them the Jordanian Government's condemnation and 
denunciation of this criminal incident against innocent, 
defenseless worshipers and the violation of the sanctity of holy 
places. The Jordanian Government held Israel fully responsible 
for this massacre and urged it to conduct an immediate 
investigation, since it provides for the settlers' weapons, 
freedom of movement, and access to holy places.

Royal Court announces a period of mourning beginning tomorrow, 
16 of Ramadan, corresponding to 26 February, and for three days,

praying at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  While deploring this grotesque crime, the Royal Court

their families and the Arab and Islamic nations patience and 
solace. From God we came and to God we will return. 
  The Council of Ministers will hold a session at 2100 [1900 
GMT] today to discuss the deplorable attack and crime in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, the measures to be taken by the government 
toward this crime, and the continuing contacts which the 
government began this morning with the ambassadors of the 
members of the UN Security Council's permanent member states, 
the nonaligned group, and the European Community.

  [Text] On the directives of His Majesty King Husayn, the 
Council of Ministers held an extraordinary session yesterday 
evening to examine the dimensions of the terrible crime 
perpetrated by the Israeli settlers at dawn yesterday against 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of Hebron. 
  The prime minister reviewed all dimensions of the criminal 
act and the Arab, Islamic, and international reactions as well 
as the impact of this incident on the peace process. He also 
reviewed the measures adopted by the Jordanian Government on the 
local, Arab, and international levels in view of the magnitude 
of the tragedy in the Ibrahimi Mosque, indicating that this 
incident conflicts with all human, religious, spiritual, and 
ethical values. Dr. al-Majali explained the urgent contacts the 
Jordanian Government held with all concerned parties. 
  The minister of state for foreign affairs briefed the 
Council 
of Ministers on his summoning of the ambassadors of the Security 
Council permanent member states and the Greek and Indonesian 
ambassadors in their capacity as chairmen of the EEC and the 
Nonaligned Movement respectively. He communicated to the envoys 
the Jordanian Government's denunciation of this ugly inhuman 
crime and demanded their countries shoulder their responsibility 
toward protecting the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab 
territories, providing security to them, and forcing Israel to 
abide by the UN resolutions, withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories, and dismantle the Israeli settlements as guarantees 
for the continuation of the peace process and the establishment 
of a just, permanent, and comprehensive peace as aspired by the 
peoples of the region. 
  The Council of Ministers announced a three-day mourning in 
the kingdom in condemnation of the ugly crime. Flags will fly 
at half mast over the ministries and both the official and 
popular departments. The government decided to suspend work 
today for two hours from 1200 to 1400 in solidarity with the 
Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories. The 
Council of Ministers also decided to offer donations to the 
martyrs' families to alleviate their suffering as a show of 
solidarity with them at this sorrowful time. The ministers also 
decided to make personal donations. 
  The Council of Ministers decided to form a higher national 
committee to supervise the collection of donations to the 
martyrs' families and the wounded. It will be chaired by the 
Chief Justice and consist of the secretary general of the Awqaf 
and Islamic Affairs Ministry, the secretary general of the 
Social Development Ministry, the director general of the 
Palestinian Affairs Department at the Foreign Ministry, the 
chairman of the Welfare Societies Union, a representative from 
the Chamber of Commerce, and another from the Chamber of 
Industry. It was also decided to form committees to collect 
donations in all Jordanian governorates. These will be chaired 
by the administrative officers. Medical aid and urgent 
assistance will be extended to the wounded. Medicine and 
medical supplies will be sent to all West Bank hospitals. The 
Council also decided to pursue contacts with sisterly and 
friendly states in order to adopt the necessary measures to 
prevent the recurrence of such ugly crimes and intensify 
diplomatic efforts to guarantee the Israeli withdrawal so that 
the Palestinian people can exercise their legitimate rights on 
their soil and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. 
  At the conclusion of its session, the Council of Ministers 
issued the following statement: 
  The Council of Ministers became acquainted with the news of 
the Jewish settlers' sinful criminal attack on defenseless 
worshipers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the dawn 
prayers--an attack which resulted in the martyrdom and injury of 
a large number of worshipers. The Council of Ministers 
expresses its profound denunciation and vehement condemnation of 
this terrible massacre. This massacre, unprecedented in 
savageness, targeted the innocent worshipers in this blessed 
month and in one of the holiest shrines. It was a continuation 
of a chain of inhuman attacks and violations targeting the 
Palestinian people. Jordan has long warned against the grave 
consequences of such attacks and violations on security, 
stability, and the peace process. 
  Israel must bear full responsibility for this action, put an 
end to all kinds and forms of terrorist acts, particularly those 
perpetrated by the Jewish settlers, disarm the settlers, remove 
settlements, and secure the protection of Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. The Council of Ministers also appeals to 
the international community and both world and humanitarian 
bodies to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent such 
incidents by guaranteeing the protection of the Palestinian 
people, securing their legitimate rights, and seeking a just and 
comprehensive settlement that ends the conflict and guarantees 
Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian and Arab 
territories, headed by holy Jerusalem. 
  The Council of Ministers, while extending deepest sympathy 
and condolences to the patient and steadfast kinsfolk and 
brothers in Hebron and the occupied territories and to the 
martyrs' families, stresses the solidarity of Jordan--king, 
government, and people-- with them in confronting such measures 
and violations. It stresses that it stands by their side in 
their just and legitimate struggle. The occurrence of such 
incidents requires us to unify efforts, close ranks, overcome 
Arab differences, and realize a unified Arab position based on 
pan-Arab constants and capable of advancing the peace process in 
order to achieve a just and lasting peace that will return 
rights to their owners and that is acceptable to future 
generations. 
  The Council of Ministers, while addressing the sons of the 
one Jordanian family, who were distressed by this serious 
incident, hopes that this will be an occasion for further 
cohesion and national unity in order to confront challenges and 
deal with them with wisdom, reflection, and reason.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Political and community leaders reacted 
vehemently Friday [25 February] to the massacre of over at least 
60 Palestinians at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and called on 
Jordanians to observe three days of mourning and calling for an 
end to peace negotiations with Israel on all fronts. 
  "We call on all Jordanians to let black flags fly over their 
homes for three days and to abstain from working for a symbolic 
1/4 of an hour Saturday in commemoration of the martyrs," read 
the announcement distributed by the professional associations 
and leftist, pan-Arab and Islamist political parties. The 
groups announced that a march would be held Suunday at 14:40 
from the professional unions building to the al-Hashimiyah 
Square in downtown Amman to mark "the anger in our hearts and 
our rejection of the peace process as it stands." 
  Leaders of political parties, popular unions and 
organisations as well as members of Parliament and Palestinian 
activists met Friday to declare their outrage at the massacre in 
a heated atmosphere which brought tears to the eyes of many and 
would-be fistifights on several occasions. 
  Less than an hour after news of the attack was broadcast. 
representatives and members of Jordanian and Palestinian popular 
unions and organisations marched from the professional 
associations complex in al-Shmaysani to the Red Cross office 
asking for international protection for Palestinians living 
under Israeli occupation. 
  Almost simultaneously after the noon prayers demonstrations 
broke out in several Palestinian refugee camps in greater Amman 
and al- Baq'ah. 
  In the al-Baq'ah refugee camp, Lower Houser member Muhammad 
'Uwaydah and Islamic Action Front representative Muhammad 
Abu-Faris joined demonstrators in condemning the attack and 
calling for an end to the peace process. 
  But the IAF was not the only group to call for an obrogation 
of the peace process. 
  Wahid al-Ja'bari, president of the Khalil al-Rahman society, 
also known as the Hebron Community Society, called on Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to "resign 
immediately." There should be an immediate vote of no 
confidence for Yasir 'Arafat and anyone involved in the peace 
negotiations." Mr. al-Ja'bari told fellow Hebronites gathered at 
the society in a massive condolence ceremony for the relatives 
of the victims of the massacre. 
  Mr. al-Ja'bari, a Hebron notable known for his close ties to 
the Jordanian government rather than the PLO leadership, said 
"all Palestinians should withdraw from the negotiations." 
  Mr. al-Ja'bari headed rows of Hebronites receiving 
condolences from Jordanian government officials, foreign 
diplomats as well as political party heads and leaders of 
popular organisations, union and professional association heads. 
  Lower House of Parliament Speaker Tahir al-Masri visited the 
society shortly after news of the massacre spread through Amman. 
"The speaker gave us his condolences and expressed his outrage 
at the massacre." Mr. al-Ja'bari said. 
  But not all visits by officials to the Khalil al-Rahman 
Society were well received. Leading members of the PLO such as 
'Abbas Zaki, acting speaker of the Palestine National Council 
Salim al-Za'nun and FIDA representative in Amman Salih Ra'fat 
were booed and Mr. Ra'fat was physically attacked during his 
visit. 
  The three Palestinian officials were not held welcome 
because 
they represent the negotiators who are responsible for the 
massacre. said one Hebronite. the three were rushed out of the 
society under protection. 
  The attack on Mr. Ra'fat came after Lower House Member 
Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Mun'im Abu-Zant called for the "liquidation of the PLO 
and the establishment of an Islamic leadership for the 
Palestinian people." 
  A member of the Palestine Central Council, Mr. Ra'fat stood 
up calling for "national unity in this time of mourning." A 
member of the audience subsequently "got up and rushed towards 
Mr. Ra'fat attempting to throw him on the ground," one observer 
told the Jordan Times. 
  The attacker was taken away by other members of the audience 
and expelled from the main hall of the society. 
  Nominal head of the IAF 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah brought many 
members of the audience to tears with an eloquent speech in 
which he referred to historic Muslim rights in Hebron and the 
"humiliation of the all Muslims on this day." 
  "As our brethren kneeled at dawn to pray, they becaome 
martyrs and we must join them in their jihad to regain the Bayt 
al-Maqdis," said Shaykh Khalifah. 
  "It is our jihad against the "world Zionist conspiracy lead 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton," said Mr. Khalifah. 
  "This proves once and for all that the peace negotiations 
are 
dead," added head of the IAF Executive Committee Ishaq al-Farhan. 
  Amman based Hamas officials Ibrahim Ghawshah and political 
bureau members Musa Abu-Marzuq addressed audiences in the Khalil 
al-Rahman Society and in the professional Associations complex. 
  But not all Palestinian parties which have operating offices 
in Jordan blamed Friday's massacre on the PLO and the 
negotiations. The Palestine People's Party, one of the three 
party's along with the mainstream Fatah and FIDA to participate 
in the peace talks, put the blame for the massacre firmly in the 
Israeli camp. 
  "We hold the Israel government and security forces 
responsible for Friday's massacre," said a statement by the 
party. 
  The group called on a halt to negotiations till "settlers 
are 
disarmed and international protection is provided for 
Palestinians under occupation. [no closing quotation marks as 
published] 
  Participants in a meeting held at the professional 
Associations complext called for the donation of one day's wages 
to the families of persons killed or wounded in the massacre and 
urged the organisation of a blood donation drive for the wounded. 
  The participants, who included representatives of political 
and private organisations, also called for the secondment of a 
medical delegation to the occupied territories to offer medical 
assistance to the wounded and called for discussing the prospect 
of bringing to Jordan wounded Palestinians to receive treatment 
in Jordan.

  [Text] The Senate held an extraordinary session today under 
the chairmanship of Ahmad al-Lawzi. During the session, Prime 
Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali briefed the Senate on the 
government contacts on the massacre perpetrated by the Israeli 
settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque yesterday. The Senate then 
issued a statement condemning the ugly crime. 
  [Begin al-Majali recording] In the name of God, the 
merciful, 
the compassionate. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Brother members of 
the honorable Senate: I would like to stress the feelings of the 
government, which fully supports all that was said in this 
honorable Senate this morning. We want to inform the Senate that 
denunciation--and I think this happens for the first time in the 
history of this cause--has come from all parties: The European 
and American parties and even the Israeli leadership regardless 
of whether this Israeli denunciation is a fact or a cover. But 
this is the first time such a denunciation occurs in the manner 
we all have heard. It is natural that upon the directives of 
his majesty the king, contacts were held on the Arab, Islamic, 
and international levels and the third world states. The 
ambassadors were summoned and informed of the importance and 
seriousness of this incident and its impact on the entire peace 
process. The crime is unprecedented in history. It was killing 
in cold blood, not killing in which there was resistance. They 
were in the mosque praying. Therefore, this takes a world 
dimension. We should act on the information, press, and 
diplomatic levels so that this fact reaches all western minds 
continuously and persistently in order to be greatly influential. 
  We were informed that the Americans are taking this issue 
very seriously and they denounce it. Hence, they supported an 
old request made by Jordan to hold the negotiations in one place 
and to hold them continuously until results are achieved. I 
think the U.S. President's call on Israel and the president of 
the Palestinian state to send all delegations to Washington is 
meant to discuss this matter very seriously. We hope this is so. 
  On this occasion, we insist that the root cause of these 
terrorist acts and killings is the occupation of land and the 
construction of settlements. Therefore, we now insist that the 
settlements, as we insisted in all our negotiations, are the 
obstacle. In all their statements, the United States and the 
West also said that. But they might not have felt the 
seriousness of this issue except after the perpetration of this 
crime yesterday. 
  Moreover, the UN Security Council met. We supported this 
meeting, in which discussions and deliberations are still 
continuing. 
  As for what concerns us here, the government announced an 
official three-day mourning. It set up a fund for donations. 
As you see, members of the Senate are offering their 
contributions. Moreover, the government allocated 100,000 
Jordanian dinars, in addition to His Majesty King Husayn's 
donation of another 100,000 Jordanian dinars. A full campaign 
will be launched in support of our kinsfolk in the occupied 
territories. One of the things from which they suffer is the 
financial aspect. We should not forget this. Unfortunately, 
for a long time our kinsfolk have not had financial support 
adequate to enable them to have at least the basic requirements. 
  Therefore, we hope this support by the Senate will enhance 
this and be able to reach those who need it. The committee [as 
heard] is comprised of both the private and public sectors. The 
government will continue all its measures based on our stands in 
Washington. We told the head of the delegation there to convey 
our full feelings and to observe the situation in order to adopt 
a united stand with the Palestinian, Syrian, and Lebanese 
brothers on the issue of negotiations there. We believe that if 
the Americans commit us and force Israel to sit continuously and 
act in a serious manner, perhaps the harmful incident might help 
in finding a solution or reaching clearly defined measures soon. 
We will keep the Senate informed of any further developments. 
  As for the security situation, about 5,000 people are 
currently staging a march at al-Husayni Mosque. However, it is 
a peaceful march. Community colleges and universities closed 
down. In al- Baq'ah, about 5,000 people staged a march toward 
Suwaylih. Some of them returned, while others are still there. 
There is a march of about 400 people in al-Zarqa'. A march 
staged at 'Azmi al-Mufti camp is over. People at the Jerash 
camp are on their way to hold a prayer for the dead. There are 
small gatherings in various parts of the country. 
  We support all forms of expression. However, we are afraid 
of marches because various elements get involved. As everyone 
knows, those with different views unfortunately take advantage 
of marches to carry out acts of violence that we can do without. 
Let the marches be peaceful and strong and let the support be 
in its right place. 
  The government called on the Arab world to close ranks 
because this will enable us to avoid such an incident and obtain 
our rights. We call for and fully support holding an Arab 
summit. We support your request to hold a meeting of Arab 
parliaments in order to adopt a stand toward this incident. 
  Thank you, sir. [end recording]

  [Text] Amman, 26 Feb (PETRA)--The Senate has vehemently 
condemned the heinous crime carried out by Zionist extremists. 
Hundreds of innocent martyrs and wounded people among Hebron's 
citizens fell victims to this crime at dawn yesterday. 
  The Senate met in an extraordinary session this morning, 
attended by Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and other 
ministers. The session was devoted to discussing the dimensions 
of this crime. 
  Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi said the terrible crime 
perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers at the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron at dawn yesterday -- in which hundreds of 
innocent martyrs and wounded people fell as victims -- makes it 
necessary to draw lessons and explore the results this terrible 
event implies and the dangers and challenges it poses. 
  Al-Lawzi said the extraordinary session is a contribution by 
the Senate to the efforts of his majesty, the homeland's leader 
and the faithful one Jordanian family. This session will allow 
brother senators to exchange views and consultations. They will 
contribute to enhancing Jordan's honest march and national unity 
in view of this barbaric crime, and to consolidating Jordan's 
pan-Arab responsibilities. Jordan has never failed to assume 
these, in terms of supporting the Palestine question and the 
Palestinian people's struggle to regain their rights and achieve 
self-determination on their national soil and secure the 
implementation of international legitimacy in order to realize a 
just and comprehensive peace that ends occupation and removes 
the settlements. 
  The Senate later observed one minute of silence for the 
martyrs. The senators read the opening chapter of the Holy Koran 
for the martyrs' chaste souls.

  [Text] Amman, 26 Feb (PETRA) -- The House of 
Representatives has condemned the massacre during dawn prayers 
at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron yesterday. This took place at 
the extraordinary session the House held this afternoon under 
Speaker Tahir al-Masri, atttended by Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, to discuss the results of the 
reprehensible massacre Zionist extremists carried out against 
defenseless worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  At the start of the session, al-Masri said yesterday's 
incident is a mournful and momentous event. Although what the 
Zionists had perpetrated against the people in Hebron is not the 
first of its kind that the Palestinians and Muslims have 
experienced at the hands of the Zionist aggressors, the manner 
in which it was carried out, in a safe and sacred place, adds to 
the harm done to one's sentiments and makes it stand out as a 
very strange incident. 
  Al-Masri added: If our relatives in the occupied territories 
cannot be safe in their mosques and during their prayers, then 
where can they be safe?

  [Excerpt] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament Saturday 
strongly condemned "the ugly massacre committed by the Zionist 
authorities through its settlers" against Palestinian worshipers 
in the Cave of Patriarchs in Hebron on Friday and urged 
international protection for Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  "As it condemns this crime and the conspiracy of the Israeli 
occupation forces with the settlers as well as the conspiracy of 
the hegemonous forces with the occupation, the (House) declares 
that it is time for Arab awakening," the deputies said. 
  "Statements of condemnations will not relieve the nation of 
its duty," the House said in a statement issued hours after the 
end of a special session held to discuss what House Speaker 
Tahir al-Masri called a serious event and a huge massacre. 
  "Statements of condemnations have become abundant and so 
have 
international decisions...but the Zionist enemy continues to 
shed Palestinian blood," the statement said. 
  The House urged the Arab and Muslim nations "to confront the 
aggression, overcome their differences and unify their stands 
because (all Arab countries) are targetted." 
  In the statement, which was drafted by the House's permanent 
office, deputies urged Arab and Muslim countries to move on the 
international level and at the U.N. Security Council to have the 
international community stand up to the "aggression and demand 
that Israel withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and 
provide protection to the Palestinians until the pullout is 
completed." 
  The House called on Arab and international parliaments to 
condemn the continuous Israeli crimes against the Palestinians 
and guarantee their rights, mainly their right to 
self-determination. 
  While expressing appreciation of the immediate steps the 
government took in reaction to the massacre, the deputies urged 
the executive authority to increase its efforts to guarantee 
Arab, Muslim and international support for the Palestinians. 
  During the session, lawmakers said the massacre emphasises 
the necessity of concrete measures to protect Palestinian 
civilians in the occupied territories but differed on how it 
should affect the Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  The 16-member Islamic Action Front (IAF) bloc said the House 
should demand that the government withdraw from the negotiations 
but failed to get a House vote on its bid after other deputies 
argued its constitutionality. 
  The House must call on the government "to abandon the 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations and move towards 
preparing the people to support our armed forces in the coming 
battle of honour," deputy Hamzah Mansur said in a speech on 
behalf of the IAF bloc. 
  "The criminal act has proven the correctness of the position 
of the IAF and other national, pan-Arab and Islamic forces... 
that it is impossible to coexist with the Jewish enemy and that 
(the peace process) consolidates the occupation of our lands and 
holy places," the IAF said. 
  Mr. al-Masri argued against putting the IAF bid to vote on 
the grounds that such an important decision should not be taken 
after a "hasty and superficial discussion," pointing out that 
the session was specifically called to discuss the massacre and 
not the policies of the government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman--Gloom, shock and anger hung over Amman 
Saturday as flags flew at half mast, many schoolchidren staged 
sporadic protest marches and a two-hour closure to mourn the 
victims of Friday's Hebron massacre. 
  Jordanians of all backgrounds showed their outrage by taking 
to the streets in one of the most spontaneous public outbursts 
of anger since the Gulf war. In Irbid, al-Salt, al-Baq'ah and 
all over Amman, men, women and children took to the streets 
waving black and green as well as Palestinian flags, shouting 
Islamic slogans and calling for an end to "negotiations with the 
enemy." 
  "No need to speak with those who murder us. Speak their 
language, the language of jihad," said a speaker at the 
al-Husayn Mosque during noon prayers Saturday. 
  Speaking to a crowd of some 2,500 people gathered in the 
downtown square in front of the mosque after marching from 
different districts of Amman, the speakers urged Muslims to 
"return to your faith and become defenders of the faith in 
Palestine as in Bosnia." 
  "The trio that betrayed you," (Israel Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq) 
Rabin, (U.S. President Bill) Clinton and (Palestine leader 
Yasir) 'Arafat must not be allowed to pave the way of our 
future," said one speaker from inside the mosque whose address 
was broadcast through loudspeakers. 
  Police sealed off much of downtown and traffic came to a 
halt 
while the speakers addressed the crowd. 
  A heavy police presence was visible all over the city. 
Embassies, foreign banks and many other international 
organisations, fearing emotional reprisal owing to their foreign 
affiliations, reported a security alert. The day passed without 
incident, however. 
  Numerous Amman groceries, many of them owned by natives of 
Hebron, closed for the entire day to mark the first day after 
the killings. 
  All shops downtown were closed and black flags flew from the 
shutters of many. 
  The crowd at the al-Hashimiyah Square in downtown continued 
their march and converged at the Roman amphitheatre at around 
1:30 p.m. and dispersed soon afterwards. The demonstrations 
were organised by the Islamic Action Front and a group of 
pan-Arab leftist parties. 
  Schoolchidren who were let out of school at 12:00 p.m. began 
demonstrations in their local neighbourhoods. Students at the 
University of Jordan also staged a protest. 
  Groups of 40 to 60 schoolchildren could be seen Saturday in 
various parts of al=Shumaysani, downtown, Jabal al-Taj and 
al-Jawfah, Garden Street and Bayadir Wadi al-Sir as well as the 
al-Baq'ah and al-Wahdat camps raising the Palestinian flag and 
shouting slogans to protest Friday's killings. 
  A group of some 60 students with green arm bands shouting 
"there is no god but God," converged on the closed American 
embassy in 'Abdun ini the morning hours but were turned back by 
American embassy guards and police. It was the first reported 
group of protestors to converge on the embassy, built two years 
ago. The group left no statement and did not identify 
themselves, according to embassy staff. 
  Jordanian papers ran eight column headlines of Friday's 
killing with explicit pictures of the victims. Akhir Khabar, a 
liberal Jordanian daily, ran one of the most stunning headlines 
--"shalom"-- acroos its frontpage along with a blown-up picture 
of a dead man with his mouth open and blood running out. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Saturday vowed to 
step up the armed struggle against Israel and carry out revenge 
attacks for Friday's killings. 
  "Yes to the revolution of the knives," Hamas spokesman 
Muhammad Nazzal told a press conference. 
  The movement called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
to immediately withdraw from the negotiations with Israel. 
  "We call on 'Arafat to withdraw and for the negotiators to 
withdraw immediately," said one head of Hamas in Jordan, Ibrahim 
Ghawshah. "The Palestinian people know who they are and where 
they are," he said of negotiators living in the West Bank and 
Amman. It is clear that the negotiation option is not the 
option of the Palestinian people but a people-less leadership in 
Tunis. 
  "It is a shame that 'Arafat is planning to go to Washington 
with 30 people before the blood of the martyrs has even had the 
chance to dry. It shows his disrepect for the suffering of his 
people," Mr. Ghawshah added. 
  "Rabin is responsible for security and occupation. So this 
is his domain," concluded Mr. Ghawshah. "But the blood of the 
Palestinian people will be avenged."
