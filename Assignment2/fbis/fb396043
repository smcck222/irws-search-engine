<F P=106> [By an unidentified JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Nearly 4,000 people marched through the heart 
of Amman Sunday [27 February] rejecting the 28-month-old Middle 
East peace process and calling for the downfall of Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. 
  The peaceful protest was called to express condemnation of 
Friday's massacre of more than 60 Palestinians by one or more 
Jewish settlers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank town of Hebron. 
  But it turned to a highly politicised event to register what 
Islamist and leftist politicians as well as union leaders 
asserted was a popular rejection of any negotiated peace with 
Israel. 
  "No to peace, yes to holy war," shouted the protesters, who 
began their march from the central bus station at al-'Abdali and 
dispersed at the al-Hashimiyah square in downtown Amman after 
brief speeches by leaders of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) and 
leftist organisations as well as heads of professional 
associations. 
  The speakers severely assailed Mr. 'Arafat and his 
peacemaking strategy with Israel and demanded that all Arab 
parties, including Jordan and the PLO, withdraw immediately from 
the peace talks. 
  Police kept a tight watch over the marchers, who included 
around 200 veiled women, but did not interfere. No violent 
incidents were reported. 
  Banners wielded by the protesters, some of them masked and 
others holding aloft the Holy Koran, denounced the massacre and 
said: "No to surrender, no to negotiations," "Revenge, 
revenge," "armed struggle is our only choice," and "no for 
self-rule." 
  The marchers condemned Mr. 'Arafat for accepting the Sept. 
13 
autonomy agreement with Israel and demanded that he be ousted 
from the chairmanship of the PLO. 
  "Yes to the PLO, no to 'Arafat," said the protesters. 
  Addressing the PLO chairman, they chanted: "Your day of 
judgement is coming." 
  It was the latest rally to be held in Amman following the 
Hebron massacre, and was higher in political intensity than any 
other demonstration held since Friday, save another hardline 
protest march held in the al-Baq'ah camp Saturday. 
  Earlier Sunday, a group of about 150 school students marched 
through the Jabal al-Husayn refugee camp to condemn the mosque 
massacre and vowing revenge. 
  The centrist al-Mustaqbal party, led by Sulayman 'Arar, 
issued a statement on Sunday describing the Hebron killings as 
"a Ramadan gift by the Zionists to the Muslim and Arab people." 
  The massacre should serve as a reminder to those who are 
engaged in peace talks with Israel that "there cannot be peace 
and security in the region as the racist state (Israel) exists 
among them." 
  "Retribution in kind, not condemnation and statements, is 
the 
answer to this crime and other crimes committed by the Zionists 
against the Palestinians and Arabs... starting with (the 1948) 
Dayr Yasin massacre and (the 1982 killings at) Sabra and 
Shatilla and the (1968) burning of al-Aqsa Mosque," said the 
statement. 
  Jordan is observing a three-day national mourning that ends 
Tuesday for the victims of the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
and the government is also raising funds to help the families of 
those killed and wounded in the attack.

  [Text] A responsible source at the Interior Ministry has 
said that in the wake of the criminal massacre that took place 
at dawn today at the Ibrahimi Mosque, some marches were staged 
in Amman to protest the heinous crime committed by Israeli 
settlers against pious worshipers in Hebron. 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, the source said 
Khalid Husni al-Qurashi attacked (Lon Edwards), a British 
tourist, at the Hashimite Square at noon today and stabbed him 
with a knife. The tourist was immediately rescued. He is now in 
a good condition. The assailant was arrested. 
  The Interior Ministry expresses its understanding of the 
overwhelming feelings that accompanied the grave event that took 
place at the Ibrahimi Mosque today. It, however, urges citizens 
to exercise self-restraint and close ranks so the feelings of 
support for our people in the occupied homeland will not turn 
into irresponsible, instantaneous reactions that harm our 
feelings and our just cause.

<F P=106> [From the "News at Ten" program] </F>
  [Text] Jordan has raised tens of thousands of dinars to 
support the victims of Friday's [25 February] Hebron Mosque 
massacre. His majesty the king had spearheaded a nationwide 
fundraising campaign and donated 100,000 dinars to support the 
families of the Palestinians killed by the Jewish settler. 
  The government announced a similar donation in addition to 
private donations from cabinet ministers, civil servants, 
deputies, and senators. 
  Three popular fundraising committees reported warm public 
response to calls for helping the victims' families. Amman 
Mayor Mamduh al-'Abbadi, who heads a popular committee helping 
the Palestinians, said it would give 1,000 dinars to each of the 
families of Palestinians killed in the mosque and the ensuing 
violence. He said the committee would also give 300 dinars to 
families of the Palestinians injured in the mosque massacre. 
  Mr. 'Abbadi told REUTERS that the committee offered to treat 
the Palestinian victims at Jordanian hospitals.

<F P=106> ["Issue and Opinion" column: "Israel and U.S. To Blame for </F>
the Bloody Dawn Massacre", by Salamah 'Ukur] 
  [Text] It should be quite obvious now -- both to the 
Palestinians and the whole world -- that cohabitation between 
the Palestinians and Jewish settlers in Gaza and the West Bank 
is unthinkable. Accordingly, there is a need to rethink the 
Oslo, Davos, and Cairo agreements, as well as the Gazaz-Jericho 
accord itself. The proposed phased settlement on the 
Israeli-Palestinian track -- envisaging an interim five-year 
period followed by a final settlement, the outlines of which are 
by no means clear -- also needs to be reexamined. Inevitably, 
then, the Palestinian leadership will have to back out from a 
stage-by-stage settlement that it concluded with Israel under 
U.S. pressure. Having done that, the Palestinian leadership 
will have to push for the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as Resolution 181, which calls 
for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The 
Palestinian leadership has a strong case to advance to the U.S. 
sponsor of the peace process and the international community; 
namely, that the U.S. initiative and the Madrid conference were 
launched on the basis of UN resolutions, the land-for-peace 
formula, and the Palestinian people's national legitimate rights. 
  The international community, including the powerful, 
permanent members of the UN Security Council, are now all too 
aware that Palestinians in the occupied territories are being 
subjected to a genocidal effort. Hence, it is not reasonable to 
act as if nothing has happened and carry on with the 
negotiations with Israel while the physical liquidation of the 
Palestinians continues, especially since there is not a single 
piece of evidence for an Israeli willingness to pull out from 
the entire Gaza Strip and the West Bank and Jerusalem. Nor is 
there any indication that Israel is willing to entertain the 
idea of an independent Palestinian state -- now or in the 
future. All of which is not lost on the Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, who has indicated that he is not pursuing an 
independent Palestinian state, but a confederation with Jordan! 
  That being the case -- in other words, since the Palestinian 
leadership has renounced the right to self-determination and an 
independent state as stipulated by UN resolutions -- why not 
walk out of a sham peace exercise holding no promise of 
fulfilling Palestinian rights? 
  The Palestinian leadership has exhausted its bargaining 
chips 
at the negotiating table with Israel and failed to get anything 
of significance in the way of the national rights of the 
Palestinian people. This is because it did not treat UN 
resolutions, or the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace 
formula as a point of reference. Instead of giving an 
affirmative response to President Clinton's invitation for 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to go to Washington to 
conclude a final deal, which, in any case, can by no means 
advance national, legitimate Palestinian rights, the Palestinian 
leadership might have suspended the talks, or attached 
courageous strings to their resumption. 
  It is worth recalling here Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres' remark that Israel was negotiating with itself and 
dictating terms. 
  I will go so far as to call on the Palestinian leadership to 
withdraw from the peace process if only to keep from bargaining 
away Palestinian rights. I will call on the Palestinian 
leadership to let Jordan and Egypt negotiate the future of the 
West bank and Gaza on its behalf, since the two territories were 
caputured from Jordan and Egypt. The two countries can conduct 
the negotiations on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 
stipulating Israeli withdrawal from all the territories Israel 
conquered in June, 1967. 
  If Israel has an interest in true and comprehensive peace, 
it 
will have to pull out from all occupied Arab territories -- the 
Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and south Lebanon 
-- in compliance with Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  If the United States wants to make a go of its peace 
initiative and see durable peace, security, and stability 
prevail in the region, it will have to talk or coerce Israel 
into complying with the UN resolutions on the basis of which its 
initiative and the Madrid conference were launched. 
  I believe the Palestinian leadership must acknowledge its 
failure to regain Palestinian rights, and then go on to entrust 
this historic and momentous mission to Jordan and Egypt, both of 
which are better positioned to do the job. With the right 
amount of coordination and solidarity, the cordon states -- 
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon -- can regain the occupied 
Arab territories. Subsequently, the Palestinian leadership can 
take the initiative and claim self-determination from Jordan and 
Egypt, and the Palestinian people can exercise their rights 
either by setting up their own independent state, forging 
confederal or federal ties, or entering into an outright merger 
with any of the cordon states. Obviously such a move on the 
part of the Palestinian leadership calls for a rare degree of 
courage. 
  I dare say that such a courageous stand would win the 
support 
of the political and popular circles in the Palestinian, Arab, 
and Islamic communities. Will the Palestinian leadership take 
inspiration from the holy month of Ramadan and summon the 
courage to do the right thing, and thus rob Israel of the chance 
of keeping up its genocidal effort against the Palestinian 
people? 
  The bloody dawn's massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque is a 
meaningful lesson that ought to be learned. 
  The Palestinian leadership and the Arab nation must hold 
Israel and the U.S. Administration responsible for the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and its consequences.

<F P=106> ["The Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "This is the </F>
Reply!"] 
  [Text] Having closed our eyes and contemplated an 
appropriate reply to the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre in Hebron, 
and having heard proposals and talks and read slogans, we 
suggest the following: 
  --The PLO should declare an immediate withdrawal from the 
peace negotiations, cancel its recognition of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, close the Palestinian ranks, gather all 
the small and large factions without exception into one 
framework, and deploy the PLO forces on all Arab borders with 
Palestine. 
  --The Arab regimes participating in the peace process should 
do exactly as the PLO does, close the file of negotiations 
forever, call on the Arab Defense Council to meet, form a 
unified military command, and declare war on Israel. 
  --The oil-producing states, including the Libyan 
Jamahiriyah, 
should cut the supplies to the Western states and turn this Arab 
wealth into a weapon in the battle because the Arab oil is for 
the entire Arab nation. 
  --The Arab states should ignore their differences, close 
their ranks, firmly support the Palestinian people, and view 
their international relations on the basis of the Palestine 
question because it is the Arabs' first and basic cause. 
  --The Arab states should lift the embargo on Iraq and 
compensate it for all the destruction inflicted on it during the 
second Gulf war. Moreover, the movements waging an armed war 
against the current regimes in Algeria and Egypt should halt 
this war and declare a general truce because priority should be 
given to the confrontation with the enemy. 
  --The Islamic states should declare a holy jihad, channel 
their forces and efforts toward the land of mobilization and 
steadfastness [Jordan], and abandon their previous positions, 
taken since Israel was established. 
  --The Russian nationalists and communists should topple the 
regime of Boris Yeltsin and reinstate the former Soviet Union, 
which supported the Arabs and stood against imperialist Western 
ambitions. 
  These are the elements of the real reply to Israel. Perhaps, 
the first and most important element, however, is to unleash the 
freedom of the Arab individual and allow him to have his own 
opinion about his future and that of his homeland -- this will 
be the real reply. 
  Note: Had one-half of these demands been achieved, the State 
of Israel would not have been established in the first place, 
and no one would have dared go to Madrid, Oslo, and other cities.

  [Text] Amman, 27 Feb (PETRA) -- His Majesty King Husayn has

who were holding a mass at Sayyidat al-Najat church in Zuq 
Micha'il in Lebanon. 
  In a cable he sent to His Excellency Lebanese President 
Ilyas 
al-Hirawi, his majesty said the victims fell in the church as a 
result of a plan by a criminal mentality that is no different in 
its evil intentions and tendencies than the mentality that 
planned the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Following is 
the text of the cable: 
  Your Excellency Brother Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi. 
  May God's peace and mercy be upon you. 
  We received with great sadness and deep sorrow the report on 
the ugly criminal incident represented by an outrageous attack 
on peaceful citizens, who were holding Sunday mass at Sayyidat 
al-Najat church in Zuq Micha'il this morning, and the resulting 
victims from among the people of sisterly Lebanon. Those 
victims fell as a result of a plan by a criminal mentality which 
is no different in its evil intentions and tendencies than the 
mentality that planned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
Friday morning, the victims of which were citizens piously 
performing the dawn prayers to God almighty. 
  As I express to you my sympathies on behalf of myself and 
the 
people and Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, I ask 
God almighty to grant his mercy to the victims' souls. May God 
help you so that you may continue your benevolent march toward 
the advancement and progress of your homeland and toward 
maintaining its security and the future of its generations. May 
God fortify the victims' grieved families with patience. 
  May God's peace and mercy be upon you. 
  Your Brother King Husayn

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Same Party Behind the Two Crimes at the </F>
Ibrahimi Mosque and the Lebanese Church"] 
  [Excerpt] It seems that there is a hostile scheme to drown 
the Arab cordon [al-tawq] states in blood. 
  There is no doubt that Israel and its agents are behind this 
odious scheme. 
  Israel has started to play the tune of sectarianism to sow 
seditions. 
  Israel carried out the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron 
and 
also perpetrated another reprehensible crime at the Lebanese 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
  The timing of these two odious crimes is not a coincidence, 
but is the result of a studied and premeditated plan. In view 
of these crimes which have greatly pained the Jordanian leaders 
and people, Jordan, under his Majesty King Husayn, took the 
initiative and acted on all Arab, regional, and international 
levels to acquaint the entire international community of the 
hideousness of this type of terrorism, which undoubtedly is 
Israeli terrorism. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty the king was the first to realize the dimensions 
of this treacherous scheme that is hostile to the cordon states 
and to the peace process which is based on the international 
legitimacy resolutions. His majesty linked the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and the Lebanese Sayyidat al-Najat Church massacre, in 
that there is one party which planned for these two odious 
crimes. 
  His majesty also held consultations with the Lebanese and 
Syrian presidents to contain this odious scheme which seeks to 
drown the region in blood and sow sedition so as to foil it 
before it becomes uncontrollable. [passage omitted]

instructions to support the convening of a UN Security Council 
meeting and stressed the need to take the necessary measures to 
protect the Palestinians and maintain their security. 
  The foreign minister added that the president telephoned

  President Mubarak received a message from U.S. President 
Bill 
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and expressed 
his deep concern at the threats to which the Palestinians are 
being subjected. During these contacts, the president stressed 
the need to take the necessary measures to avoid a recurrence of 
such an incident in the future, for preventing the settlers and 
extremists from threatening and terrifying the Palestinian 
citizens, and for taking this into consideration during the 
talks on the Palestinian-Israeli track, which basically aim to 
restore the rights of the Palestinian people, their land, and 
their security.

  [Text] Manama, 26 Feb (WAKH) -- The State of Bahrain has 
strongly condemned and denounced the reprehensible crime and 
odious massacre the Zionist settlers have committed against 
Palestinian citizens who were performing dawn prayers at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, as a result 
of which scores were martyred and hundreds were wounded. 
  A responsible source at the Bahraini Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs has described this massacre as a terrorist act and held 
the Israeli Government and its security organs fully responsible 
for the terrorist acts these terrorist settlers carry out, which 
violate all international laws, norms, and charters and endanger 
the comprehensive, just, and lasting peace process in the region. 
  The source called on the international community and the UN 
Security Council, particularly its permanent members, to fully 
assume their responsibilities toward this act by not just 
denouncing and condemning it but by taking measures to protect 
the Palestinian people and secure their legitimate right to the 
establishment of their independent state on their national soil.

  [Text] Five people have been killed in the territories 
since the murder in Hebron this morning: two in the al-Burayj 
refugee camp, one in Gaza, one in Nabulus, and one in Bayt Jala. 
Four were killed in incidents with IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
soldiers and one by fire directed by a settler whose vehicle was 
stoned. Over 40 people were wounded in the incidents in the 
territories throughout the day. Also, 13 soldiers and border 
policemen were lightly wounded in the incidents. An IDF officer 
was injured in his head during a stoning incident in Halhul. 
The team from a Palestinian ambulance treated the wounded. 
  Moods on Temple Mount have calmed after large police forces 
curbed the stone throwers with gas grenades and rubber bullets. 
Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that several hundreds 
of the Muslim worshipers who were at the Temple Mount at noon 
remain, but they are not rioting. Stones were thrown at the 
Western Wall plaza during the riots, and Border Police jeeps 
evacuated the Jewish worshipers there. About a dozen Jews are 
praying there now. Thirteen policemen were lightly injured in 
the clashes on Temple Mount.

  [Text] The National Assembly has strongly condemned 
Friday's ugly Zionist crime against our Palestinian Arab people. 
  In a statement, the assembly stressed that in the name of 
the 
Iraqi people, it denounces that terrorist, racist crime. It 
urged the international community, the United Nations, the 
Security Council, and the Arab League to assume their historic 
and human responsibilities in order to provide protection for 
the Palestinian Arab people in the occupied territories and to 
ensure their right to self-determination. 
  The assembly urged world humanitarian organizations to stand 
up against Zionist racism and terrorist practices in the 
occupied territory against the defenseless Palestinian people. 
It urged Arab people everywhere to close their ranks and forge 
a broad Arab front against defeatists, those running behind the 
U.S. mirage and spiteful dreams, and those anxiously seeking to 
join the capitulatory settlements that have led to further 
deterioration in the Arab situation. 
  Praising the heroic stand of the Palestinian revolutionaries 
everywhere, the assembly stressed that Arab unity can be 
achieved only through the full recognition of the Palestinian 
Arab people's rights to their territory and water, not through 
defeatism, retreat, and behind-the-scenes plans

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--The Arab League Council has 
condemned the ugly Israeli crime against unarmed Palestinian 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on the occupied West 
Bank in which scores of people were martyred and hundreds of 
others were wounded and has called it a terrorist action that 
expresses organized state terrorism. 
  In its emergency meeting this evening at the Arab League 
headquarters, the council held the Israeli occupation 
authorities responsible for this crime and those committed by 
the Israeli settlers. The council called on the Israeli 
authorities to disarm the Israeli settlers. 
  The Arab League Council decided to reaffirm its Resolution 
5269, adopted in its extraordinary session on 11 and 12 January 
1993, calling on the United Nations to find a suitable mechanism 
to implement the provisions of the fourth Geneva Convention by 
detailing a UN force to provide protection for the Arab citizens 
in the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. 
  The council called on the cosponsors of the Madrid 
Conference-- the United States and Russia--in view of their 
special responsibility for ensuring the success of the peace 
process to undertake a principal role in providing the necessary 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. 
  The council also called on the UN Security Council to send a 
UN committee to investigate this serious incident and adopt the 
necessary measures to enable the committee to carry out its 
mission. 
  The council also called on the Security Council, 
particularly 
the cosponsors of the Madrid Conference, to immediately 
implement the council resolutions regarding Israeli settlements 
in the occupied Arab territories as illegal and an obstacle to 
comprehensive and just peace, particularly Resolution 465 of 
1980, which called for the dismantling of the existing 
settlements and suspending any plans for the establishment of 
new settlements in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem. 
  The Arab League Council decided to consider 15 Ramadan of 
every year a day to commemorate the martyrs of the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre to remind the international community of the 
inhuman Israeli actions. 
  The council called on the Arab states to provide all forms 
of 
aid and support to the families of the Palestinian victims and 
martyrs. 
  The council decided to ask the Arab League secretary general 
to continue his contacts with all the international bodies to 
ensure the implementation of this decision and urge them to 
adopt whatever is needed to protect the Palestinian people in 
the occupied territories. 
  The Arab League Council called on the cosponsors of the 
peace 
conference to work seriously to achieve peace by enabling the 
Palestinian people to secure their legitimate rights, including 
their right to self-determination, and establish their 
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Feb (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser to 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and head of the Palestinian 
delegation to negotiations with Israel for the implementation of 
the temporary self-rule in Gaza and Jericho first, has announced 
that the next round of Palestinian-Israeli talks, scheduled to 
take place in Cairo Monday, has been postponed until after the 
Palestinian leadership has determined its position on U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's invitation to talks in Washington. 
  He told MENA that he and the Palestinian delegation will 
leave for Tunis Sunday morning to meet with the Palestinian 
leadership under the chairmanship of president 'Arafat to decide 
on a response to the U.S. President's invitation. 
  What matters is not the venue of the talks, he said; the 
talks in Egypt, both in Cairo or Taba, were going very well, and 
Egypt is providing all possible support, Sha'th explained. 
  The issue is not where we negotiate but what we negotiate, 
he 
said. He urged international protection for the Palestinian 
people in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles reached in Oslo. 
  Dr. Sha'th accused the Israeli Army of colluding with the 
Israeli settlers who carried out the criminal massacre and the 
horrible killings in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron at dawn 
yesterday. 
  Without genuine protection against the Israeli settlers, the 
Palestinian people will face daily massacres, he said. 
  These criminal acts, Sha'th added, cannot be perpetrated by 
individuals. He noted the bad emotional climate and the 
collusion of the Israeli Army with the perpetrators of massacres. 
  Sha'th wondered where the Israeli Army was, which usually 
fills the plazas of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the 
Palestinians pray daily in the mosque under the guns of the 
Israelis. Where was the Israeli Army at the time of the 
massacre, he wondered. 
  Sha'th stressed that eight worshipers were killed by Israeli 
Army gunfire at the mosque's entrance while trying to leave. 
  Sha'th stressed the need for reconsidering the form, method, 
and demands of the Israeli negotiators. 
  He pointed out that two-thirds of the draft security 
agreement worked out during the talks in Cairo and Taba deal 
with Israeli demands for the protection of settlers. It is the 
Palestinian people that really need protection, he stressed. 
  Sha'th said: We demand international protection for the 
Palestinian people, because this is part of the Oslo agreement, 
and Israel cannot reject it. He noted that Israel has so far 
been procrastinating in accepting such protection. 
  Concluding, Sha'th stressed that the next 
Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations will mainly focus on international protection for 
the Palestinian people so that the criminal massacre and the 
horrible killings will not recur.

correspondent Mufidah Hashani in Tunis on 26 February; recorded] 
  [Text] ['Arafat] The most important [word indistinct] is 
international protection for (?our people). We must see a 
solution for these settlements and the armed settlers, because 
they have proven to be time bombs liable to explode at any 
moment whether we pursue the negotiations or [words indistinct]. 
The situation may explode at any moment. They are time bombs. 
  [Hashani] What do you expect from the Security Council's 
meeting tonight? 
  ['Arafat] We are in continuous contact with the U.S. 
Administration on this issue because we insist on a resolution 
from the Security Council, not just a condemnation of [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Hashani] Where have the negotiations between you and the 
United States reached? 
  ['Arafat] They are continuing. 
  [Hashani] Any idea about the resolution expected to be 
passed? 
  ['Arafat, interrupting] [Words indistinct] but as I said, we 
are continuing our contacts with the U.S. Administration on this 
issue. 
  [Hashani] What about tomorrow's meeting with the Palestinian 
negotiators who were recalled by the PLO for a meeting in Tunis? 
Other than the settlements issue, can you clarify other topics 
of the meeting's agenda? 
  ['Arafat] I prefer not to talk too much and would rather 
like 
the deeds do the talking. There will be a complete and 
comprehensive assessment and afterward we will make a decision.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat at PLO </F>
headquarters in Tunis by Shadiyah Riyad in Cairo in the "Talking 
Newspaper" program--live] 
  [Text] [Riyad] Your Excellency, the Palestinians' security 
under the Israeli occupation is Israel's responsibility. Do you 
believe that Israel is incapable of providing security for the 
Palestinians or is it not interested in their security? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to say something very important. 
There is full involvement by the Israeli Army in the crime that 
took place today, that massacre which was carried out in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque. The army had been an accomplice in many earlier 
incidents. When I say this I do not say it lightly. It is 
known that the Israelis have sequestered Sarah's Grotto, which 
was Abraham's wife's, and turned it into a synagogue. This was 
done inside the mosque. Therefore, there is constant guard at 
the entrances of the mosque and around it. That is why they 
cannot say that any settler could sneak in with his weapon. The 
settlers entered behind an army captain and under cover of the 
Israeli army. They committed their crime, which has resulted so 
far in 65 martyrs and 256 wounded people. The army covered the 
getaway of these criminals. It also opened fire on the people; 
six martyrs fell and about 22 persons were wounded as a result. 
The number of martyrs in Hebron has not been counted as yet. 
In addition, the army is staging confrontations in all areas; 
in Gaza, Ramallah, Qalandiyah, Bethlehem, Qalqilyah, and 
Nabulus, where dozens of people have been martyred or been 
wounded since morning. There is complicity between the army 
[pauses] it might not be in the army. But a considerable sector 
of the army command was accomplice to this crime, earlier 
crimes, and the crimes that are taking place throughout the 
country at present. I would like to remind you, Sister Shadiyah, 
that I clearly pointed a few weeks ago to the army's involvement 
in distributing and selling weapons in the territories. They 
think that by the time they withdraw, chaos will prevail among 
our people, our folk, and our strugglers. This tells us that 
there is an integrated plan which the Israeli Army is carrying 
out. Let people near and far realize the dimensions of this 
crime. 
  [Riyad] Mr. President, there is an uproar among the 
Palestinian population, some of whom call for suspending the 
negotiations because the atmosphere is not appropriate. Do you 
think that this ugly massacre will lead to the suspension of 
negotiations or will it dictate continuing and speeding up these 
negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] No doubt, we must understand that the main 
objective of these criminals is to strike at the peace process. 
We are now studying all possibilities. 
  [Riyad] Does this require a revision of the concepts 
governing the peace process and does this development dictate 
new issues? 
  ['Arafat] No doubt, it will have extremely negative effects 
on the entire peace process. I contacted all the international 
sides, the co-sponsors of the peace conference, the permanent 
members of the UN Security Council, and the EU members, all the 
European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, the 
Arab states, the African states, and all our friends in the 
world. I also asked that an immediate and emergency session of 
the UN Security Council be convened. We demand international 
protection following the actions with the collusion of the 
Israeli army and the armed settlers as part of an integrated 
plan. Therefore, we urge all the honest people of our friends 
and all our Arab and Muslim brothers, all the peace-loving 
people, and all the freedom-loving people to immediately help us 
by putting an end to these massacres and to swiftly introduce 
international protection for our people inside our occupied 
territories. 
  [Riyad] Mr. President, this brings me to a question about 
your expectations concerning the reaction of the international 
community. If I rightly recall, in 1990 there was another 
massacre in the al-Aqasa mosque in which dozens were killed, but 
maybe not as many as those killed today. At that time, the 
matter was referred to the UN Security Council, which condemned 
Israel. The Palestinians then called for international 
security, but Israel refused and the international community 
could not enforce such protection. Do you think that this 
scenario will be repeated, or are things different now? 
  ['Arafat] Everything has become exposed. As of today, the 
world, the world leaders, and the world officials should 
shoulder their international responsibilities, humanitarian 
responsibilities, political responsibilities, and moral 
responsibilities. They must give their word. Will they leave 
Israel and its army to carry out acts of belligerency against 
the Palestinian people, against our faithful, our worshipers, 
women, children, and people? Will they leave this belligerency 
without control? I say that the entire world must know that our 
people will not kneel down. This is the people of martyrs. We 
are all martyrs-in-waiting. People far and near must understand 
these words. 
  [Riyad] Thank you sir. 
  ['Arafat] May God bless you. 
  [Riyad] Thank you very much. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Statement by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, following a </F>
meeting with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, in 
Carthage on 25 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] This meeting with the president coincides with this 
grave and large-scale massacre against people praying in the 
holy al-Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil [Hebron] in our occupied 
land, which resulted in 65 martyrs and 256 injured. It was 
perpetrated by armed settlers in collusion with, and with the 
participation of, the army guard which was guarding this area. 
The latter had taken part in the opening of fire against our 
kinfolk in al-Khalil area [following the massacre] killing 8 
martyrs and injuring 28. Clashes flared up in all our land, in 
Gaza, Nablus, Jenin, in Galilee, in Bethlehem, in Khan Yunis, in 
Rafah, in Qalandiyah, in Jerusalem. Even in Jerusalem, people 
performing the Friday prayers today were subjected to an attack 
by special units of the [Israeli] army resulting in between 60 
to 65 injured. 
  I have put the president in the picture of all these matters 
in detail, and of the collusion between the armed settlers and 
some elements in the Israeli Army. 
  I would like to add also that we have called for an urgent 
meeting of the Security Council because we are now in need for 
an international force to protect our people, our kinfolk, our 
children and women, and the conspiracy has now become clear, 
aimed at all our people and all our kinfolk, and it clearly 
exposes the dangers caused by settlements and settlers. I want 
to say all these things, and I have coordinated with the 
president so that he may help us whether at the international, 
local, or UN level, or all levels. In my own name, I have 
thanked him for the noble feelings showed by Tunisia in this 
terrible loss. This is not surprising on the part of Tunisia, 
and its president, government and people. 
  Despite the large-scale nature and size of the tragedy 
concerning this massacre, our people, the people of martyrs, 
freemen and mujahidin, will bear it as it has borne before it 
many blows dealt to it by these dangerous elements. 
  At any rate, clearly what is meant is to deal a blow at the 
heart of the peace process, and the dimensions of this 
conspiracy have become clear. In this respect, I address myself 
to the two cosponsors of the peace conference who had signed 
with us the agreement last September in the White House, to all 
the international community and to the members of the Security 
Council, whether the permanent ones or the non-permanent ones, 
to take up their tasks and shoulder their responsibilities at 
all levels to face up to this serious development. Thank you.

  [Text] The volcanoes of blood have erupted. The woods of 
fire have blazed. And the pillars of the universe have been 
shaken by the gravity of Palestinian suffering and the deep 
Palestinian wound, which, whenever about to heal, opens up again 
to pour out hot blood [words indistinct] amid bloody sacrifices 
to wash away the shame of the world. [words indistinct] who 
abandoned God and humanity. May they be cursed. Having them 
uprooted from the land has become a duty. [words indistinct]. 
God is great. The Palestinian blood was spilled in the 
courtyard of the Ibrahimi Mosque while those who kneeled for 
their God in prayer [words indistinct]. Then, the Zionist 
hatred poured down on them in the ugliest form, the lowliest 
way, and [words indistinct]. 
  In front of the Israeli Army and under the sponsorship of 
the 
Israeli Government, and in accordance with accurate planning, 
Zionist soldiers and settlers stormed the Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. They volleyed their machine gun fire on the crowds of 
worshipers, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Fifty-three 
were martyred instantly and hundreds were wounded. When people 
hurried to hospitals to (?rescue) their wounded, the Israeli 
Army besieged them, especially in the courtyard of the al-Ahli 
Hospital. Five others fell martyrs and dozens were wounded. 
  Afterward, rage broke out throughout Palestinian territory 
-- 
in Gaza and Jerusalem, in Dayr al-Balah and Janin, in Khan Yunus 
and Ramallah, in Rafah and al-Birah, in Nabulus and Bethlehem, 
and in all towns, villages, and camps. There, Palestinian wrath 
broke out. The Zionist Army and the herds of settlers were lying 
in wait. They wounded dozens of people with their treacherous 
bullets. 
  God is great. God is great. This is a black Friday in 
Ramadan. This is an ugly massacre in Ramadan. This is an 
appalling crime in Ramadan. It was committed by the Zionists -- 
government and settlers, soldiers and terrorists; all are the 
same. They have committed this premeditated crime, knowing that 
[words indistinct] that their withdrawal from our territory is 
imminent and their days over our soil are numbered. 
  God is great. God is great. [words indistinct] the wound of 
the Ibrahim mosque tells the Zionists: You will inevitably 
leave. You will leave. [words indistinct] Long live Palestine. 
Glory to the martyrs. Glory to the resisting arms. God's 
victory is imminent.

Almighty God that this will mark the end of acts of violence 
whatever and wherever they maybe in this world. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Husayn Calls for a Practical Arab Response </F>
to the Bloody Massacre"] 
  [Excerpts] The real practical response to the bloody dawn 
massacre that was committed in an unprecedented odious manner in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has come from Jordan. 
  The Jordanian leadership and people were not content only to 
condemn and denounce the reprehensible crime, organize protest 
demonstrations, explain its obnoxious hostile and provocative 
designs, and outline the intentions of those behind it but 
accompanied this with concrete practical measures denoting 
maturity, wisdom, and deliberation. His Majesty King Husayn 
donated 100,000 Jordanian dinars. The Government also donated 
100,000 dinars. The Jordanian citizens donated goods and 
medicines, as well as the blood needed for the wounded. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's reply was a national response 
showing a high sense of responsibility, wisdom, and clarity of 
vision. The king called on the Arab leaders to shoulder their 
responsibilities, and to unite their ranks, actions, and stands. 
He also called on them to forget their differences and rise 
above the causes of dispute and estrangement. [passage omitted] 
  In any case, all the people and countries in the world and 
all the international organizations and bodies, including the UN 
Security Council and the United Nations, have come to realize 
that it is impossible to achieve peace in the occupied 
Palestinian territories with the presence of the settlements and 
the Jewish settlers. 
  It has also been proved that the Arab citizens, the Islamic 
holy places, and the Muslim and Christian places of worship 
there need international protection. This requires the dispatch 
of an international peacekeeping force to the occupied Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank to protect their inhabitants and holy 
places. The responsibility for the bloody dawn massacre at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque is borne by Israel and by the United States 
which encourages it to pursue its settlement policy. This 
calls for a united Arab stand to confront all these momentous 
challenges.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah called the 
bombing at Sayyidat al-Najat Church an atrocity and lamented the 
death of innocents. The bombing, he said, signals a new pattern 
of attacks on places of worship. He added that the crime is 
designed to disturb the country's security and political life 
and unsettle the public's renewed sense of civic peace. 
  Israeli hands cannot be absolved of this crime, whose 
purpose 
was to divert attention from the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
and trigger a new cycle of violence in the country, Fadlallah 
stated. He called on the authorities to uncover the evil hands 
that carried out the crime.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Amal Movement's leadership on 27 February </F>
-- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The movement's leadership denounces the appalling 
massacre committed by Israel and its agents against our people 
worshipping at Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. It 
believes that this crime is a new link in the chain of Israel's 
daily acts of aggression against our people in occupied 
Palestine and south Lebanon. The movement's leadership stresses 
that the pattern of mass murders is uniquely perfected and 
practiced by Israel, and what happened a few days ago at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and today in Sayyidat al-Najat Church 
are the best proof of this. 
  Today's abominable crime, which Israel is using along with 
its other daily aggressive acts against the south to show that 
Lebanon is unstable and insecure, will only increase the 
Lebanese people's determination to cling tighter to the state 
and its institutions and increase their unity and solidarity in 
the face of any aggression against Lebanon. 
  While expressing solemn grief over the martyrs and the 
wounded in today's incident, the movement extends condolences to 
all Lebanese and emphasizes its solidarity with and 
participation in the mourning scheduled to be observed tomorrow 
by the Lebanese state. The movement prays to God Almighty to 
have mercy on the deceased, grant speedy recovery to the 
wounded, and continued peace and national unity to Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah, followed </F>
by a question and answer session, with unidentified 
correspondents in Beirut 27 February--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Samahah] At the invitation of his excellency 
the prime minister, the Council of Ministers held an 
extraordinary meeting this evening. His excellency the 
president attended and chaired the meeting. 
  The Council of Ministers devoted its extraordinary meeting 
to 
the attack against state security, which took the form of an 
explosion at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il this 
morning. At the beginning of the meeting, his excellency the 
president briefed the ministers on his contacts with Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad, who denounced the attack and placed 
Syria's resources at the disposal of Lebanese authorities to 
discover the perpetrators. He also briefed the ministers on his 
contact with his majesty the king of Jordan for the same 
purpose. His excellency the president also briefed the Council 
of Ministers on all his contacts from within the country and 
abroad denouncing the attack. 
  The Council of Ministers then examined the implications of 
the crime and its intention to weaken confidence in the security 
situation and the economic and social stability in Lebanon, fan 
sectarian fanaticism in the country, and divert the attention of 
world public opinion from the massacre committed by Israel in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied Palestinian 
territory. The Council of Ministers praised the overwhelming 
reaction through which the Lebanese expressed comprehensive 
national unity in the face of this attack that was directed 
against the country's security and unity. 
  The Council of Ministers decided to refer the attack against 
the state security in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
Mikha'il to the Judicial Council. Following the statement 
issued by his excellency the president, the speaker of the 
Chamber of Deputies, and the prime minister this morning calling 
for public mourning tomorrow, the Council of Ministers also 
decided to call for a general strike tomorrow. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] There are measures that are being adopted by the 
security commands in all the areas at the instructions of the 
Council of Ministers and the ministers concerned. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the crime 
that took place, have you specified the [words indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] All that was said by the officials today refers to 
whoever we think, and we can confirm, is behind this attack, 
crime, massacre this morning against the worshipers in Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] referred to 
those who opposed the pope's visit to Lebanon. You hoped that 
they had no hand in the church explosion. Did you mean Minister 
Walid Junblatt? 
  [Samahah] Not at all. Minister Walid Junblatt is one of 
those who has welcomed the visit of his holiness the pope and 
has cooperated with the Lebanese authorities. He has adopted 
declared positions with regard to domestic unity and receiving 
the pope in Lebanon. The ones I meant know who they are. They 
issued statements on this matter last week. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] Perhaps. Let us leave it to the investigation to 
determine that. We hope it will end soon and that the 
perpetrators will be discovered soon so that everyone will be 
reassured and we can know the aim and background of this attack.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz stressed that 
investigations are continuing to discover the perpetrators of 
the crime committed at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
Mikha'il, noting that this requires great efforts. After 
meeting U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley, who conveyed 
condolences for the victims of the crime, Buwayz noted that he 
discussed the steps being taken by the United States toward 
Israel to control such extremist actions as the attack in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Buwayz said: 
  [Begin recording] [Buwayz] Investigations are continuing 
into 
the church crime. At the cabinet meeting yesterday, several 
decisions were made to boost security agencies' interrogations 
and increase coordination among them to discover the 
perpetrators of this carnage. No doubt, resolving this issue 
will require great efforts, particularly because the 
perpetrators are professional and capable. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Can you tell us about the content of 
the message you received from the U.S. ambassador? 
  [Buwayz] The meeting had two goals: We received condolences 
from the U.S. ambassador on the martyrs of the Sayyidat al-Najat 
church carnage. He advised us on steps that the U.S. Government 
has taken with Israel to control extremism such as the attack in 
the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  [Reporter] After the incidents in the Ibrahimi Mosque and in 
Juniyah yesterday, do you believe that the fate of the peace 
talks is now threatened? 
  [Buwayz] The negotiations encounter extremism from here and 
there. No doubt, the decision and responsibility for peace make 
it imperative for all countries and parties concerned to follow 
clear and firm line in dealing with the (?rejectionists). We 
believe that it is high time for the Israeli Government to put 
an end to continued provocations that impede the atmosphere of 
peace in the region. 
  [Reporter] Will the church crime affect Pope John Paul's 
visit to Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] I do not think it will affect the pope's visit. The 
pope usually visits countries and peoples beset by difficulties, 
not prosperous and stable countries. He usually visits peoples 
suffering from problems. 
  [Reporter] The Washington peace talks have been suspended. 
Do you think that they will stop forever? 
  [Buwayz] Talks are under way with the U.S. to ensure the 
continuity of the peace talks. [end recording]

  [Text] Commenting on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi has stated: They talk about human 
rights and classify the countries that do not respect these 
rights. Are today's massacre in Hebron and the victims who died 
while praying to God Almighty on the occasion of blessed Ramadan 
included in these human rights? How can this be explained? How 
would it be classified? Is anything more barbaric than this? 
What is the stand of the civilized world demanding human rights 
vis-a-vis such a massacre that reminds us of the Hitler era? 
  President al-Hirawi added: Condemnation is not enough. We 
are waiting for some action and a clear decision from the United 
Nations, the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace conference, 
and the pioneers of freedom led by Europe and especially France. 
  President al-Hirawi then asked: What measures will be taken 
to protect the people in the occupied territories?

  [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has declared that the 
massacre perpetrated in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron today was 
designed to ruin the negotiations and create a climate of 
obstruction and chaos that will hinder all the peace efforts. 
Buwayz said he believes this is neither a new nor a transient 
Israeli act. 
  These remarks by Minister Buwayz were quoted by the 
reporters' doyen Milhim Karam, who, along with a delegation from 
the Journalists Association, met the foreign minister at noon 
today. 
  [Begin Karam recording] His Excellency Minister Faris Buwayz 
believes that this morning's massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque in 
the blessed month of Ramadan was designed to ruin the 
negotiations and create a climate of obstruction and chaos that 
will hinder all the peace efforts. The foreign minister 
believes that this Israeli conduct is neither new nor transient, 
because the Israeli Government is a weak government that 
colludes with and facilitates the acts of every saboteur, 
fundamentalist, or extremist movement. 
  Reports in the past two days of a prospective Cabinet 
reshuffle are untrue. Minister Buwayz asserts that any earnest 
discussion of a reshuffle, Cabinet change, or of ministers 
swapping portfolios is not in the cards now and has not yet been 
discussed seriously. [end recording] 
  Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman of the 
Higher Islamic Shiite Council, speaking during a Friday sermon, 
called for halting the negotiations or at least freezing them 
for a time to confront the world with its responsibility. If we 
do not do this, he remarked, we will be helping to conceal the 
crime. 
  Shams-al-Din added: We are no longer concerned with 
protecting the fragile peace, especially if the Hebron massacre 
is a harbinger of what will come later. 
  He called for reinforcing national unity to confront Zionist 
aggression, to stop attaching too much importance to minor 
sectarian and denominational issues, and to renounce personal, 
factional, and partisan ambitions. 
  The interior minister denounced the incident and demanded 
international intervention.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri said that 
the Hebron Mosque shootings is another chapter in the record of 
Zionist terrorism and is an incentive to unite and insist on 
liberating the land. He called for escalating resistance to the 
Israeli occupation forces. He stressed that Israel does not 
seek peace in the region and that its attempts to circumvent the 
Geneva summit are continuing, sometimes by threatening to repeat 
last summer's aggression and at other times by imposing 
obstructionist conditions to withdrawal from south Lebanon and 
implementation of Resolution 425. 
  For his part, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has called for 
collective action to end the occupation. He affirmed that a 
comprehensive and just peace is the means to achieve a genuine 
peace and noted that any partial agreement in the name of peace 
will only lead to further conflict and the shedding of innocent 
people's blood. 
  The Amal Movement urged international legitimacy to prove 
its 
credibility and enforce the implementation of its resolutions, 
which Israel violates daily. 
  The Progressive Socialist Party viewed the massacre as a 
message to the Arabs and Muslims and another disgrace for 
Zionism, which world public opinion acquitted of charges of 
racism at the United Nations. 
  The National Liberal Party denounced the massacre and 
expressed fear of its negative impact on the peace process.

  [Text] Sidon today observed a general and total strike in 
protest over the Hebron Massacre and to mark the 19th 
anniversary of the martyrdom of leader Ma'ruf Sa'd [founder of 
the Nasirite Popular Organization]. There was a large 
demonstration in which thousands took part, including youth 
organizations and students. Deputy Musafa Sa'd and 
representatives of patriotic and Islamic Lebanese and 
Palestinian parties also took part. 
  Deputy Sa'd addressed the demonstrators, pledging loyalty to 
the ideas of Martyr Ma'ruf Sa'd and determination to defend the 
rights of the working and dispossessed classes against the 
monopolistic clique. 
  Sa'd also vowed that resistance will continue until the 
liberation of the south and Western al-Biqa'. He called on the 
international community to put an end to the brutal Zionist 
practices against the sons of Palestine.

  [Text] 'Ayn al-Hulwah, Lebanon, Feb 25 (AFP) -- Around 
2,000 Moslem fundamentalist demonstrators called here Friday for 
the downfall of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and the elimination of 
Israel after the Hebron massacre. 
  The demonstrators emerged from five mosques in the 
Palestinian refugee camp, shouting "Death to Israel" and 
pledging to continue the armed struggle against the Jewish 
state, an AFP correspondent said. 
  Banners read "Move Over 'Arafat" and "Down, Down 'Arafat." 
  They carried green flags, a colour which symbolises Islam, 
and chanted Koranic verses, including: "There is no God but God." 
  Some of the demonstrators tore up pictures of 'Arafat, whose 
support has fallen dramatically in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah camp since 
the signing of the September 13 PLO-Israel autonomy accord. 
  Abu Ayyub, an official of the local al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, 
urged 'Arafat to give up the "treacherous accord" and urged all 
concerned parties to put an end to the Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  Around 200 demonstrators also protested in the Bass camp in 
the southern port of Tyre following a call by the Islamic 
Resistance Movement (Hamas), correspondent there said. 
  Palestinian and fundamentalist groups, including factions of 
'Arafat's Fatah organisation, vowed to avenge the killings on 
the West Bank. 
  In a statement released in 'Ayn al-Hulwah they also called 
for an end to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and the 
"reinforcement of the intifadah in the occupied territories." 
  They urged the international community "to slap economic 
sanctions" on Israel and declared three days of mourning in 'Ayn 
al-Hulwah, home to around 75,000 people. 
  Schools shut down in 'Ayn al-Hulwah as news of the massacre 
broke out here and shops were shuttered when the demonstration 
got underway. 
  The PLO representative in Lebanon, Shafiq al-Hut, meanwhile 
called for an urgent meeting of the Palestine National Council, 
the PLO's parliament in exile which he said should be attended 
by non- PLO members as well. 
  Al-Hut also said the peace talks should be called off. 
  Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz said the massacre "is 
the result of the encouragements given by the Israeli Government 
to extremists opposed to the peace process." 
  "We can say that the Israeli Government is the accomplice of 
radical and extremist movements in Israel," Buwayz said. 
  Palestinian dissident leader Munir Maqdah blamed 'Arafat's 
policies for the massacre and said that the PLO leader "has no 
other choice to shoot himself in the head and commit suicide." 
  "Our response against the Israeli Army and the settlers will 
be strong," Maqdah said, adding that Palestinians opposed to the 
peace talks will use all the arms at their disposal in 
coordination with Hamas and the radical Islamic Jihad. 
  At least 58 Palestinians were killed and dozens more were 
wounded when one or more settlers shot worshippers at the Tomb 
of the Patriarchs in Hebron, and troops subsequently clashed 
with demonstrators.

<F P=106> [Unattributed political commentary: "A Peace Based on </F>
Blood"] 
  [Text] This week saw a series of dramatic developments in 
the Palestinian arena. Israel has covered many phases in 
programing and organizing the Palestinian-Palestinian dispute 
and shifting it onto the stage of a military clash. It imported 
large quantities of arms to the Gaza Strip while discussing an 
imminent military withdrawal from the Strip after it became 
certain of the essence and security and political details of its 
successive accords with the PLO in Oslo, Cairo, Washington, 
Taba, Paris, Davos, and other capitals. 
  Rabin acknowledged this plan with disparagement and derision 
when he announced that the new situation creates a sense of 
mistrust, asking what will happen among the various Palestinian 
factions that might engage in a power struggle. He said: 
Wherever there is a thriving market, regrettably, there are 
Israelis who collaborate on smuggling arms from Israel to be 
sold to the Palestinians. He added: Nearly every day, a 
Palestinian is killed at the hands of his fellow Palestinians. 
  Doesn't this reveal Israel's persistent hostile intentions 
toward the Palestinians and its arming itself with the 
Gaza-Jericho Accord and its appendixes to express these 
intentions? We said before that the accord will generate an 
inter-Palestinian dispute stretching to the extent of an 
internal war that would destroy the intifadah and achieve 
Israel's old dream and goal, giving Israel a pretext for its 
strategy. In such an event, Israel will present itself as an 
advocate of peace and absolve itself of every condemnation to 
tell the world later, according to Rabin's statement, that it 
was not strict with the Palestinians and did not deal with them 
harshly, as they themselves deal with each other. At the same 
time, Israel will have paved the way for eliminating the 
Palestinian cause in terms of material and human resources by 
Palestinian hands after it has provided a political atmosphere 
for such a move through the Gaza- Jericho Accord. It will do it 
without relinquishing its right to participate in eliminating 
the cause if need be, according to the recently signed 
appendixes. 
  In this context, the Israeli Administration sowed new 
sedition. It withdrew the Jewish soldiers from the Gaza area and 
delegated the task of the blockade to Arab soldiers serving in 
the Israeli army to deepen political, denominational, and 
sectarian division and weaken the Palestinian fold from within 
so that it will have time to track down the symbols of the 
intifadah in the Hamas Movement, Fatah ranks, or other 
Palestinian organizations. 
  This does not seem enough according to the Israeli plan. 
The Hebron residents woke up today to a horrible massacre 
perpetrated by Israeli settlers inside a mosque in which scores 
of people were martyred or wounded. Who will ask Israel to 
arrest and punish these criminals? Isn't this act aimed against 
the peace process in the view of the United States and Israel? 
Are the resistance in south Lebanon and the intifadah in 
Palestine in defense of rights a hindrance to the region's peace 
process? Is the Hebron massacre today and are previous 
massacres positive signs and elements of strength and momentum 
for this peace process? 
  Why haven't we heard an American or international 
condemnation of this carnage? Why aren't sanctions imposed 
against Israel? Where do the dangers to Israel lie when it 
enters the peace process? Where is its adventure, as the 
Americans, who adopt the Israeli stance, say? 
  Is this carnage and are Israel's measures inside the 
occupied 
territories the preconditions that they mention for guaranteeing 
Israel's security and compensating her for engaging in the peace 
process? 
  What if the Arab Palestinians or non-Palestinians rose up 
and 
responded to Israel's acts? What would the American, Israeli, 
European, and international reaction be? What kind of peace is 
this that is based on annihilating a nation? What is this just 
and comprehensive peace when Israel's act of murder is 
collective and covers Palestinians everywhere, the Lebanese, and 
others? Where is the peace of nations against Israel's 
practices and massacres? 
  The United States has a major responsibility for what is 
happening. The argument that the United States is not involved 
because the issue is now between the two sides after it paved 
the way for them cannot be ignored or accepted. The Arab 
countries too are responsible and able to pressure the United 
States and Israel if they want to and sense their responsibility 
to halt their rush, their race, toward Israel and their haste to 
end the boycott of and be open to Israel. But the greatest 
responsibility is Palestinian, whether on the level of the PLO 
or other factions and forces. It is a responsibility to 
escalate the struggle against Israel, especially within Israel, 
to coordinate, cooperate, and integrate with Syria, and to stop 
this dialogue taking place at the expense of Palestinian blood 
in the blessed month of Ramadan and all year round to deter 
Israel and end the state of collapse and successive political, 
material, and human losses incurred by the Gaza-Jericho Accord.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The Lebanese newspapers on 26 February 
give front page prominence to the Hebron massacre, publishing 
various reports and pictures and offering angry editorial 
comment. 
  Beirut AL-ANWAR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an 
approximately 800-word editorial signed by Rafiq Khuri, the 
newspaper's chief editor, under the headline "Some Anger and 
Some Thinking." Contending first that "there is nothing worse 
than the Hebron massacre except the policies leading to it," 
Khuri says reaction to the killings "needs more than Rabin's 
'sense of shame,' 'Arafat's 'anger,' the Security Council's 
'elegies,' and the world's 'condemnation.'" He maintains: "The 
forces that planned and perpetrated the crime were carrying out 
an organized political act, not an act of revenge or 'gratuitous 
killing' as was said." Khuri says he believes: "What matters 
now is not what Rabin and 'Arafat say, but what they do. The 
world is awaiting not hot public reaction, but cool action 
behind the scenes." 
  The writer notes that opponents of PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat 
and the peace process are calling for halting the negotiations 
and adopting armed struggle to liberate the occupied 
territories, while the United States, Europe, and many other 
concerned parties believe that the best reaction to the massacre 
is to speed up the peace process. Commenting on this, Khuri 
says: "The call for armed struggle needs different 
circumstances and different balances of power" and the call for 
accelerating the peace process "needs different American and 
Israeli policies." He explains: "When Israel wants to take 
settlements, peace, security, and share water and resources 
without giving up the land, then this is not a solution. And 
when Washington plays the role of a spectator at negotiations 
between a strong side and a weak side, then this is not a just 
and comprehensive settlement." Khuri concludes: "The problem 
has two sides: While war has no horizon, the road to peace is 
long, very difficult, and planted with massacres and dangerous 
policies. What is required is an aggressive U.S. position and 
some Arab anger and thinking." 
  In an approximately 500-word front page editorial in the 
Beirut paper AL-NAHAR in Arabic entitled "The Big Question," 
Chief Editor Ghassan Tuwayni describes the Hebron killings as 
"the second Dayr Yasin" [a Palestinian village that witnessed 
killings in 1947]. The paper poses its "big question:" "Does 
the Israeli mentality accept peace with others, Muslims or non 
Muslims, Arabs or non Arabs, or Palestinians or non 
Palestinians?" 
  Referring to talk of peace and normal relations with Israel, 
the paper asks: "What kind of normalization do they want if the 
Israeli Government, no matter how strong, remains 
unable--assuming it wants to do something--to confront the 
madness of instinctive killing?" Continuing to cast doubt on the 
possibility of peace with Israel, the paper asks whether the 
massacre means there is only room for terrorism and 
fundamentalism in Israel and whether the only dialogue with 
Israel is that of extremism, hatred, killing, and terrorism. 
  Beirut AL-SAFIR in Arabic publishes on page 1 an 
approximately 1,000-word article by chief editor Talal Salman 
headlined "Palestine Has No Reference Other Than Its Blood." 
Salman laments that Palestine and its people are left alone to 
face the "Israeli ghoul." He notes that the world dealt with the 
massacre as "a security incident" in Israel concerning only the 
Israeli Government. Salman criticizes the "impotent" 
Palestinian leadership and says peace with Israel is only an 
illusion: "Israel is Israel, Palestine is Palestine, and the 
divide between them is the edge of the sword. The spilled blood 
washes away the barriers and drowns the illusions of an 
impossible settlement between the executioner and the victim." 
Salman maintains that the Israeli Government, army, settlers, 
and people are one and the same thing. He concludes: "Israel 
is Israel. It did not change. It won't change unless we grow 
strong and force it to change."

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 28 (AFP)--Around 3,000 angry pro-Iranian 
and pro-Syrian demonstrators burned an effigy of PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat in a protest march here to mourn Palestinian Moslems 
gunned down in Hebron. 
  Hundreds of Palestinian women marched alongside the 
demonstrators carrying black flags in mourning for the 52 
Palestinian Moslems who were killed in a West Bank mosque on 
Friday by an Israeli settler. 
  They shouted "Death to 'Arafat" and "Death to Zionists" 
before burning an effigy of the PLO leader at the Martyrs 
Cemetery, where many Palestinians killed in confrontations with 
Israelis are buried alongside Lebanese. 
  Supporters of Hezbollah and radical Palestinian 
organisations 
based in Damascus participated in the demonstration which took 
off from outside a mosque in Beirut's mostly Shiite Moslem 
southern suburbs. 
  Many denounced the September 13 peace deal between the PLO 
and Israel.

  [Text] Just in from the editor's desk: According to a 
report by the Security Forces, there are so far eight dead and 
25 injured in the church explosion. The security forces 
reported that another explosive charge that was planted inside 
the church did not go off. A military expert was summoned to 
defuse it. This is the latest report from the security forces. 
  Naturally, after the explosion there was commotion and the 
situation is worrisome there. That is why we have been unable 
to obtain accurate information, because the security forces are 
touring the hospitals to report on the death toll and names of 
the casualties. 
  To repeat: There are eight dead and 25 injured as of now and 
the security forces are defusing another explosive charge that 
did not go off. 
  The other charge was certainly planted to cause a large 
number of casualties. The explosive charges were placed in the 
church to explode. This was reported by the security forces. 
The confirmed report is that there are eight dead and 25 
injured so far.

  [Text] Voice of Lebanon correspondent George Shahin reports 
form the scene of the explosion: 
  [Shahin] We are reporting to you from the scene of the 
explosion in the Zuq Musbih area, where Army, Internal Security 
forces, and Civil Defense units, along with other security 
agencies have cordoned off the area. Throngs of citizens have 
assembled on the highways and roads amid a heavy traffic jam. 
According to the information announced by the interior minister 
a short while ago, nine people were killed and a number of 
others injured in the blast. He declared that the church and the 
worshipers inside it have escaped a horrible massacre because 
not all the explosive charges planted in the church went off. 
  Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij inspected the scene of the 
explosion a short while ago, accompanied by Interior Ministry 
Director General Sami Shu'ayb and Central Security Secretary 
Lieutenant Colonel Fadl Dahir. Deputy Rushayd al-Khazin has 
just arrived at the scene. 
  The manifestations of destruction were evident as Minister 
Mirhij was speaking to reporters. Mirhjij said: 
  [Begin Mirhij recording]: If they think that they can (?tear 
apart) the homeland by bombing a church and killing innocent 
people, we tell them that the church and all places of worship 
are [words indistinct]. They will not be able to destroy 
churches, mosques, or other places of worship in Lebanon. These 
places are deeply valued in the hearts of our people and in our 
land. This crime, no matter what its effect, will absolutely 
not affect our domestic situation or the internal peace that we 
all want. Our stand and that of our people's are the same: We 
will secure internal unity, social peace, and stand shoulder to 
shoulder in one line to defend Lebanon and our democratic system: 
  [Reporter] What is the latest death toll? 
  [Mirhij] A huge explosion occurred in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in occupied Palestine. That crime left dozens dead. There are 
those who seek to destabilize our society from within. We say 
that our society is stronger than (?these attempts). 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Mirhij] There must be [words indistinct], but this is not 
the proper time to determine this issue. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Minister, having been briefed by the security 
agencies on the effects of the explosion, what is the latest 
death toll? 
  [Mirhij] We are not yet sure of the number of dead, but I 
believe there are nine dead. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Mirhij] The explosive charge was designed to cause a big 
massacre, but God's care, [words indistinct] some charges went 
off but not all. Had all the explosive charges gone off, the 
result would have been devastating. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] explosive charges? 
  [Mirhij] We have not delved into details. This is the task 
of the security forces. [end recording] 
  [Shahin] The security forces are conducting investigations 
inside the church. Reporters have been forbidden to enter the 
church for security reasons. They will be allowed in later 
after the initial investigations. Destruction and devastation 
are evident inside and outside the church. There are no doors 
or windows. Cars parked nearby have been damaged, along with 
homes. The church is located in the Zuq Musbih area and there is 
heavy traffic on the highway. The Internal Security Forces are 
trying to facilitate traffic.

  [Excerpts] According to the latest report on the massacre 
that occurred in the Sayyidat al-Najat church in Zuq Micha'il, 
there are 10 dead and approximately 40 injured. They have been 
taken to hospitals in the area. Papal Nuncio Pablo Puente 
inspected the bombed church a short while ago. Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hariri also inspected the church before proceeding to 
Bkirki, where he is now meeting with Maronite Patriarch Sfayr. 
[passage omitted] 
  Interior Minister Bisharah Mirhij is now visiting casualties 
in the Sayyidat Lubnan Hospital in Juniyah. In a telephone 
call a short while ago he affirmed to us that Lebanon is 
stronger than such incidents and will survive through its sons' 
unity and cohesion. He stressed that morale is high, that the 
Lebanese people will adhere to their basic principles, and that 
no event will disturb the general national security and peace. 
  He said that the casualties suffer from serious injuries but 
morale is high, particularly among the families of the victims, 
doctors, and nurses. He stressed that the security forces are 
continuing their investigations and that sappers had managed to 
defuse the explosive charges that were set to explode after the 
initial explosion, which occurred during mass.

<F P=106> [Address by President Ilyas al-Hirawi in Beirut on 27 </F>
February--recorded] 
  [Text] O Lebanese: Wicked hands insist on harming our 
innocent kinsfolk. We insist on the steadiness of the march to 
peace and salvation. The attempts to set us on a backward 
course will not succeed. The catastrophe which occurred inside 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in the Kasrawan area this morning 
is a naked crime that will not succeed in diverting the 
attention of world public opinion. One crime does not offset 
another crime. We address the whole world and say that the all 
Lebanese rally around their state and the march to peace. They 
are unanimous in refusing to return to the imposed and 
tendentious war. 
  We condemn this concocted incident. We have asked the 
security authorities and all concerned security, judiciary, and 
military officials to do their utmost to reveal the 
circumstances of the abominable incident and to announce the 
results of the investigations to the Lebanese people. We call 
for the meting out of the harshest punishment to the 
instigators, culprits, and accomplices and for severing every 
hand which tries to jeopardize security and the march of peace. 
  Several attempts have surfaced in the past weeks to deflect 
our march from its course and to induce friction among our 
citizens. However, the state is standing firmly and steadily. 
It has proved its ability to frustrate these attempts and 
obstruct their aims. The Lebanese people's cohesion and their 
rallying around their state are stronger than all these attempts. 
  May God have mercy on the innocent victims and may he heal 
the injured. 
  What happened is yet another reason for all of us--officials 
and citizens--to cooperate to prevent the tendentious aggressors 
from toying with the unity of this homeland and its foundations. 
  Long live Lebanese unity. Long live Lebanon.

  [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah, followed 
by remarks in response to a question by an unidentified 
reporter, on 27 February; place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] This is an al-Ibrahimi-mosque-style attack 
against Christians. The perpetrator is the same and the 
objective is identical. The perpetrator in both cases is 
Israel. There is a clear Israeli hand acting here through 
agents. The two crimes--the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the 
bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat church ... [pauses] The new crime 
aims to engage the attention of international media and opinion 
in an event that looks sectarian on the surface. A crime taking 
place at Sunday mass in a church can take some limelight away 
from the Israeli-planned atrocity in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
the occupied territories, in which 55 were killed and about 300 
wounded. 
  Those who planned and carried out the church bombing hope to 
create sectarian strife in Lebanon. Therefore, the best answer 
to the atrocity is to assert solidarity among the Lebanese. 
Fortified with the lessons of the civil war, the Lebanese 
should join forces with the Government to uncover the 
perpetrators and punish them. The Lebanese know how to deal with 
such tragedies, which can always be repeated. The enemy is the 
same one. We know from past experience that they never give up. 
Therefore, we should build up our immunity by remaining united 
and cooperating with the Government. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think that the bombing is aimed at 
the 
visit of His Holiness the Pope to Lebanon [scheduled for May]? 
  [Samahah] It may be directed against the visit ... [pauses] 
Among other things, it may be directed against the visit by the 
Holy See to Lebanon. I certainly hope that those who have 
expressed opposition to the Pope's visit have nothing to do with 
this morning's incident in Sayyidat al-Najat Church. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri with </F>
unidentified correspondents on 27 February; place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Hariri] The most important thing is that the 
Lebanese should not be dragged into this plan that is clearly 
being supported by foreign hands. We are all one people, one 
hand. Whatever pains one area pains another area. God willing, 
we will transcend this ordeal and open our eyes so that no one 
will deceive us. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Al-Hariri] It is clear [words indistinct] a Christian area 
in Kasrawan to cause sectarian strife. However, it is clear 
this will not affect the Lebanese. The Lebanese, Muslims and 
Christians, are one hand. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Al-Hariri] The churches and mosques have their sanctity. 
During the worst days of the Lebanese war, no such thing 
happened. So it is clear that whoever did this thing wanted to 
inflict a deep wound. However, the Lebanese with their 
willpower and their faith in God and their homeland will not be 
dragged into such plans.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has stated 
that the purpose of this abominable crime against worshipers in 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church was to sabotage general stability in 
Lebanon. He said this crime, which coincided with an Israeli 
escalation in southern Lebanon, is an attempt to divert world 
attention from the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He noted that 
Israel is behind all this. 
  Speaker Birri called on the Lebanese to be vigilant and 
responsible so that we will all emerge from this test with more 
faith in Lebanon.

<F P=106> [Statement by Maronite patriarch Butrus Sfayr in Zuq </F>
Mikha'il on 27 Feb-- recorded] 
  [Text] A massacre of this kind is indescribable because it 
is very painful. It targeted not only this church but peace 
itself not just in Lebanon but in the whole region. Therefore, 
we vehemently condemn this massacre and implore God to remove 
hatred and prejudice from people's hearts. The criminals should 
respect human lives that belong to God and not to them. Those 
who perpetrated this act have lost a great part of their 
humanity. We invoke God to instill peace in people's hearts in 
this homeland and in the region.

General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has held an urgent telephone 
conversation with Colonel al-Qadhdhafi, in which he called on 
the Libyan leader to reconsider Libya's decision to withdraw

Libyan officials and the Arab League chief. 
  Jum'ah al-Fazzani, secretary of Libya's People's General 
Committee for Unity, arrived in Cairo yesterday and told Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid that the Secretariat of the People's General 
Committee for Unity (Ministry of Unity) is about to present a 
draft resolution to the Basic People's Congresses, calling for 
Libya's withdrawal from the Arab League on the grounds that the 
League failed to provide any service to the Arab people. 
  [Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1323 GMT on 28 February, in a 
Tripoli-datelined item, adds: "Counselor Tal'at Hamid, press 
adviser to the secretary general of the Arab League, today said

  [Text] The Arab delegations to the peace talks in 
Washington today decided to suspend [qat'] bilateral talks with 
Israel to protest the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. A spokesman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry confirmed 
statements by U.S. officials that this step does not mean an end 
to the whole peace process, which began two years ago. The 
spokesman added: No progress has been achieved in the talks 
that resumed in Washington on 24 January after a four-month 
hiatus. The spokesman said that Israel is responsible for this. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman added that Israeli 
intransigence during the talks, and its failure to make any 
positive initiatives, encouraged Israeli extremists to 
perpetrate the Hebron massacre. The spokesman said: Israel has 
made no positive initiatives in response to the constructive and 
flexible stands adopted by Syria in the Geneva summit held 
between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  In Amman, Talal al-Hasan, Jordanian minister of state for 
foreign affairs, announced that Jordan today was stopping 
bilateral talks with Israel in Washington to protest the 
massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. REUTER cited al-Hasan as 
saying that the heads of the Arab delegations participating in 
the peace talks in Washington held intensive contacts and 
decided to stop the ongoing talks to protest the criminal 
massacre. 
  Chief Syrian delegate Muwaffaq al-'Allaf today said: It is 
not logical or suitable to pursue the talks in Washington 
following the massacre perpetrated by the settlers in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque. Al-'Allaf added in an interview with Radio 
Monte Carlo: Through our suspension of bilateral talks, we want 
to express our solidarity with the Palestinian Arab people 
following this vicious aggression. 
  The heads of the Arab delegations charged al-'Allaf with the 
job of holding contacts with the U.S. Department of State to 
inform it of the stands of the Arab delegations involved in the 
talks.

culprits to book and protect the lives and properties of 
innocent people in the occupied territory. New Delhi expressed 
the hope that all concerned will adopt a path of restraint in 
bringing down tension and will not vitiate the climate of peace 
and tranquillity to make the West Asia peace process a success.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has expressed 
deep sorrow and anguish over the unprovoked and brutal assault 
on the congregation of Muslims inside the Ibrahim Mosque at 
al-Khalil city, in which more than 50 Muslims were martyred and 
several others injured. While condemning the dastardly and 
despicable act on behalf of the government and the people of 
Pakistan, the prime minister in a statement issued in Islamabad 
last night, said the incident reflects religious intolerance 
which nowadays has been directed toward the Muslims of 
Palestine, Bosnia, and Kashmir. While condemning this tendency 
toward religious intolerance, she said Pakistan considers it as 
nothing but unreasonable steps taken at individual and 
collective levels. Pakistan has taken note of PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat's appeal to convene an emergency session of the UN 
Security Council and as a member of this body, Pakistan will 
give full attention to this serious matter. The prime minister 
urged the members of the UN Security Council to make use of the 
tenets enshrined in the UN Charter and to implement the UN 
Security Council Resolution Number 242 and 338, and other 
resolutions on Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Iraqi Kurdistan Returns Iranian </F>
Helicopter"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Sources from the Kurdistan Democratic 
Party [KDP] led by Mas'ud Barzani have said that the "government 
of the Kurdistan region" in northern Iraq returned to Iran last 
Tuesday the Iranian helicopter one of whose two pilots sought 
political asylum after the helicopter landed in Mawat in 
al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate last Saturday. 
  The sources revealed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT over the telephone 
yesterday that an Iranian delegation arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan 
last Tuesday and held talks with Kurdish officials. The talks 
resulted in the Iranian delegation recovering the helicopter, 
which suffered a technical fault while returning to Iranian 
territory -- which forced the pilot to conduct an emergency 
landing in the mountainous area of Azmar near the Iranian border. 
  The sources expressed their belief that the helicopter has 
probably now returned to its Iranian base. [passage omitted] 
  The KDP sources stressed that the Kurdish authorities 
refused 
to hand over to the Iranian delegation the Kurdish [as 
published] pilot whose application for asylum -- the first if 
its kind since the Kurdish government was established 20 months 
ago -- is still being considered by the relevant authorities. 
  Sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that leading bodies in 
the "Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan" have ratified the 
reconciliation agreement concluded on 17 February between its 
general guide Shaykh 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz and Jalal Talabani, 
leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. [passage omitted] 
  At another level, KDP sources have said that Iraqi Interior 
Minister Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, half brother of Saddam Husayn, 
recently supervised the execution of 20 citizens from the 
Kurdish city of Karkuk, which is under the control of the 
central government in Baghdad. The sources added that bodies of 
the citizens, arrested in December on charges of opposing the 
Iraqi regime, were later handed to their families. The bodies 
were disfigured as a result of the torture they suffered during 
their interrogations. 
  The sources mentioned the names of five victims: Mala Hakim 
Ghafur Hamah Rida, Mala Najm-al-Din Sayyid Rashid Banghuli, 
Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, Amanj Fakhr-al-Din Hamah Sa'id, and 
'Ali Dawudi. Their ages range between 13 and 50.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "With Announcement of Velayati </F>
Visit to Baghdad, Tehran Puts Pressure on Iraqi Opposition To 
Freeze Its Activities"] 
  [Text] London -- Iraqi opposition sources have said that 
the Iranian Government has in recent weeks intensified pressure 
on the Iran-based Iraqi opposition movements to freeze their 
activities in preparation for a visit Iranian Foreign Minister 
'Ali Akbar Velayati is scheduled to make to the Iraqi capital 
soon. 
  The sources -- which are close to Iraqi Shiite movements 
which have offices and camps in Iran -- revealed that the 
Iranian authorities have banned these movements from carrying 
out any military activities across the border. They added that 
the measures included the movements' main offices in Tehran, 
Ahvaz, and Khorramshahr in the Khuzestan region (Arabistan) 
along the border with Iraq. 
  The sources in question told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
Iranians have substantially reduced the facilities they have 
provided to these movements over the past 15 years. In this 
connection they cited the withdrawal of 23 Iranian vehicles 
placed at the disposal of the Tehran-based Supreme Assembly of 
the Islamic Revolution in Iran, which is led by Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim. 
  The sources say that al-Hakim is alarmed at Iranian actions 
designed to put pressure on the Iraqi opposition to freeze its 
activities, while Baghdad openly continues to support the 
Iranian opposition operating from inside Iraqi territory. 
  Baghdad announced that early in the month Mojahedin-e Khalq 
carried out military exercises, using heavy weapons, in Iraqi 
areas bordering Iran. And Iraqi media services published a 
report -- with pictures -- about a meeting between Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn and Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian 
opposition movement. 
  Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid al-Faysal, under secretary at the Iraqi 
Foreign Ministry, visit the Iranian capital last week. He held 
five days of talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry officials. The 
talks centered on the outstanding problems between the two 
countries from the eight-year war (1980-1988) between them. 
Especially the issues of prisoners, border demarcation, and 
regulating navigation in Shatt al-'Arab, in addition to the 
problem of the Iraqi aircraft that flew to Iran during the 
Kuwait liberation war in 1991 and which Tehran has refused to 
return to Baghdad. 
  Meanwhile press reports published in Baghdad and Tehran 
spoke 
of the two sides' failure to secure solutions to these problems 
during the Iraqi official's visit to the Iranian capital. The 
announcement by Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi 
last Thursday during his visit to Germany that Minister Velayati 
will visit Baghdad soon is an indication that great strides have 
been+made in the endeavors to normalize Iraqi-Iranian relations. 
Because that visit will be the first to Baghdad by an Iranian 
official at this level since the downfall of the Shah's regime 
early in 1979. In this context the information obtained by 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from opposition organizations very close to 
Iran confirms that Tehran and Baghdad have agreed to upgrade the 
diplomatic representation between them to ambassadorial level. 
And that the two capitals are currently considering naming 
their ambassadors -- which is expected to be announced on the 
eve of or during Velayati's visit to Baghdad.

president's son-in-law [and industry minister], has been moved 
from Jordan with a view to giving him intensive treatment after 
the first brain surgery he underwent 10 days ago. The sources 
believe al-Majid may end up in a Swiss hospital, as the French 
authorities refused to grant him an entry visa to their 
territory. The Iraqi Embassy in Amman sought to move the Iraqi 
president's son-in-law to Switzerland, Cuba, Romania, or Russia.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari and Faysal Karam in </F>
Sanaa and Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah in Aden] 
  [Excerpts] The situation remained tense yesterday in 
Yemen's Abyan Governorate as the General People's Congress [GPC] 
and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] exchanged accusations about 
provocative military movements. [passage omitted] 
  Military sources in Sanaa have revealed that a number of 
soldiers from the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade were ambushed 
yesterday morning in the town of Zinjibar, capital of the Abyan 
Governorate, by soldiers from the al-Wahdah Brigade and some YSP 
militia. They said that "a limited number of al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade soldiers were on their way to al-Razi Hospital in the 
town of Ja'ar to collect the body of a colleague of theirs 
treacherously killed by soldiers from the Madram Brigade camp, 
when they were intercepted and fired on by an armed group in 
front of the hospital. Brigade member Hazzam 'Ali Musayli was 
wounded." 
  According to other reports, tanks and howitzer artillery 
units from the YSP's al-'Anad camp have moved in the direction 
of the areas of al-Milah, al-Hubaylayn, and al-Dali' in the 
province of Lahij "to occupy the old partition positions and 
prepare to besiege the forces of the (northern) 2nd armored 
brigade stationed in the area of al-Milah in Lahij." 
  "Informed sources" in Aden have been quoted as saying that 
at 
dawn yesterday 12 tanks tightened their siege of the central 
security battalion in the Radfan camp in al-Sawlaban (Aden). 
They added that "the supply of water and electricity to the 
battlion were still cut off on the direct orders of Aden 
Governor Brigadier General Salih Munsir al-Suyayli who ordered 
the expulsion of that battalion from Aden to the remote area of 
Dar Sa'd." [passage omitted] 
  According to reports received in Aden from the Abyan 
Governorate, forces of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade "continue 
to hunt down members of the Islamic Jihad Organization 
concentrated in the al-Maraqishah mountains in the directorate 
of Mudiyah." 
  The same reports revealed "the arrest of 85 Islamic Jihad 
members of various Arab nationalities who participated in the 
armed clashes in the directorate" since last Monday between 
forces of the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade and forces of the 
southern al-Wahdah Brigade which came from Hadramaut (some 920 
km east of Aden). [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH learned from YSP sources yesterday that the YSP's 
Political Bureau has been in "continuous session" since 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid's return to Aden the day before yesterday after 
brief visits to Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, and Eritrea 
after signing the Pledge and Accord Document in the Jordanian 
capital last Sunday. The sources said that "al-Bid returned 
secretly to Aden after the discovery that there was going to be 
yet another attempt by the air defenses of the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade to target his plane as it crossed the Abyan air space." 
  They also said that shots were fired by al-'Amaliqah forces 
on an Ethiopian Airlines plane over Abyan as it was on a regular 
weekly flight to Aden International Airport on the morning of 
the day before yesterday but it was not hit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The General Committee of the General People's 
Congress [GPC] met last night under brother Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and 
GPC secretary general. 
  The meeting addressed developments on the local scene in 
light of the final endorsement of the accord document on 10 
Ramadan [20 February] in Amman, capital of fraternal Jordan. 
  The General Committee praised the role played by His Majesty 
King Husayn Bin-Talal in bolstering Yemeni unity and ending the 
political crisis suffered by our people over the past months. 
The General Committee asserted that all efforts should be made 
to immediately begin practical implementation of the accord 
document. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee said that 
once the document is finally endorsed, it becomes binding and 
ends the crisis. 
  The GPC General Committee further stressed the need for the 
state's legislative and executive agencies to reassume their 
duties. This step is a must to begin the implementation of the 
accord document. Any attempt to prevent Constitutional bodies 
from reassuming their duties means circumventing the document 
and weaseling out of its implementation, despite signatures 
witnessed by local and foreign public opinion. 
  Reviewing developments in the local arena, the General 
Committee took note of the military escalation that started on 
the eve of the signing of the document and the subsequent 
actions in the Abyan Governorate in particular. The citizens of 
the Abyan Governorate are facing unwarranted attacks and 
provocations by the military units that were moved from the 
Hadhramaut and Aden governorates in the direction of Abyan. 
This was done in violation of the accord document, which 
stipulates freezing any military moves, and in violation of the 
responsibilities of national duty, which require creating a 
suitable climate to immediately move to the practical 
implementation of the accord document. 
  The GPC General Committee asserted that all efforts should 
be 
made to avoid any new escalation in this regard and work to 
return all military units to their previous positions and take 
to task all those who are behind the military escalation. The 
purpose of this is to protect citizens and maintain the noble 
national missions of our Armed Forces, which we deem a bulwark 
that protects the homeland and its sovereignty and ensures the 
citizens' safety and security. 
  The General Committee urged the people, their valiant Armed 
Forces, all political parties and organizations, mass and other 
organizations, and ulema and social figures to stand united 
against those who advocate disunity and those who sow sedition 
and against all attempts to return to the situation that 
prevailed before 22 May 1990. All should stand united in 
defense of unity and democracy and in defense of social peace 
and the homeland's national interests and to prevent bloodshed 
and safeguard citizens' rights, security, and stability. 
  Reviewing the general situation in light of the aftereffects 
of the crisis, the General Committee also urged all state bodies 
and central and local institutions to exert more efforts in 
order to alleviate the citizens' living hardships. It also 
urged these bodies and institutions to make their first priority 
the lifting of all forms of suffering and putting an end to all 
manifestations of corruption and security violations. This is 
meant to ensure a strict enforcement of the law, without any 
hesitation or going easy on violators. 
  Concluding its meeting, the General Committee urged all 
members of the GPC and all its leadership and base cadres to 
promote their relations with the masses, adhere to the accord 
document, and promote awareness of the content of this document 
between the citizens. The document is a national program for 
the coming stage. It bolsters the unity of the people and the 
homeland and protects their democratic march that is based on 
political and party pluralism, peaceful transfer of power, and 
respect for the bodies of constitutional legitimacy that 
expresses the people's free will. 
  The General Committee highly appreciated the efforts of the 
GPC representatives in the Political Forces Dialogue Committee, 
stressing the need to support the committee's efforts in the 
present stage. Now that the document is signed, the committee 
will follow up on the implementation of the document. 
  During the meeting, the General Committee made several 
organizational decisions. It also issued a press statement.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the GPC General Committee "at </F>
the conclusion of its meeting" on 24 February] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Press statement issued by the General Committee: 
  The General Committee held a meeting yesterday under the 
chairmanship of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and secretary general of 
the General People's Congress [GPC]. The General Committee 
discussed a number of topics on its agenda and the current 
developments, particularly the results of the signing in Amman 
of the pledge and accord document as well as the serious 
deterioration which preceded, coincided with, and followed the 
signing. This deterioration has threatened, from the first 
moment, the implementation of the document and aimed at emptying 
it of its national content on which all political forces were 
unanimous to tackle the exacerbating situation, At the top of 
this are the irresponsible acts, which are contrary to the 
contents of the document on the political, media, military, and 
diplomatic levels. 
  In light of this, the General Committee reiterated the clear 
principled stand of the GPC vis-a-vis the pledge and accord 
document as well as the responsibility of all parties, 
particularly the government coalition and the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee, to fulfill the commitments included in the 
document. These commitments are represented by the urgent 
tackling of the situation, basic steps, and resolutions and 
stands that must be embarked on by the constitutional 
institutions within the framework of their tasks, powers, and 
obligations defined by the pledge and accord document as well as 
by the responsibilities that must be shouldered by the Political 
Forces Dialogue Committee to implement the document on the fixed 
dates. 
  The General Committee also condemns all acts that aim at 
weaseling out of this responsibility as well as the deception 
which hides nonnational objectives and which reveals intentions 
not to implement the accord. The General Committee also 
denounces the reckless acts regrettably carried out by the 
leaders who are dominating the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] to 
escalate anew the existing crisis, to kill innocent citizens and 
the sons of the Armed Forces and security, as what happened in 
the Abyan Governorate, and to embark on unjust acts that 
threaten the homeland today and in the future, its national 
sovereignty, security, and stability. These acts expose the 
hidden and rancorous intentions against the people, their unity, 
their freedom, and democracy. These acts have been blatantly 
exposed on the internal and external levels. 
  The General Committee reiterated the need to work wisely and 
with responsibility to foil these acts and to champion the 
principled constants in which the people believe and to which 
all sons of the homeland are committed. The General Committee 
reiterated the need to work in particular toward protecting the 
pledge and accord document and mobilizing popular and official 
efforts to implement this accord, which came to reinforce the 
victory of unity and democracy and to deepen the option of true 
democracy which was highlighted by our lofty and steadfast 
people through their free will on 27 April last year being the 
source of the work of the branches of power and the maker of all 
gains and achievements. 
  The General Committee greeted the Hashemite Kingdom of 
Jordan 
-- king, government, and people -- for the great efforts it made 
to contain and tackle the crisis in our country and to sign the 
pledge and accord document being an important national 
achievement that will entrench the march of unity and stability 
in the homeland. 
  The General Committee also expressed its appreciation for 
all 
ongoing efforts made by the sisterly and friendly states in this 
direction. 
  The General Committee appealed to all members of the GPC and 
all citizens in all governorates to exercise full vigilance 
toward everthing that aims at encroaching on the homeland's 
unity, security, and stability and at threatening the existence 
of the state and its constitutional institutions. The General 
Committee appealed to all to remain united to protect and 
safeguard constitutional legitimacy and to support the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document each in his 
position. 
  The GPC will continue its work and struggle with all the 
country's good people and their political, social, and popular 
forces to safeguard unity and Yemen's existence and future 
through work, production, freedom, and democracy.

  [Text] In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', an 
official source at the Defense Ministry and the Command of the 
General Staff has noted that the military committee chaired by 
Colonel Staff 'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy chief of staff, which 
is charged with ending military deterioration, returned to Sanaa 
this evening. The committee (?failed) to return the military 
units of the al-Wahdah Brigade, which were moved from the 
Hadramaut Governorate to the Mudiyah area in the Abyan 
Governorate, and the 30th Brigade forces, which were moved to 
the village of (Kumkawz) in the Abyan Governorate because the 
other party did not respond to the committee's instructions and 
insisted on keeping the forces in these positions, thereby 
violating the decisions of the Presidential Council and the 
provisions of the pledge and accord document. 
  The source regretted the committee's failure in its mission 
as a result of the obstacles placed in its way. This, the 
source added, will escalate tension in the area and aggravate 
the situation. The source added: At 1530 today, Friday, two 
military planes flew at low altitude over the city of Mudiyah 
and the al-'Amaliqah Brigade garrison and broke the sound 
barrier. This caused a state of fear among citizens. These 
irresponsible and reckless acts fall within the framework of 
provocative acts and continuous blatant aggressions to which the 
innocent, defenseless people in the steadfast Abyan Governorate 
are being exposed. Furthermore, the source added, these acts 
aim at tightening the siege on the al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which 
began on Sunday, 10 Ramadan [20 February], the moment the pledge 
and accord document was signed in Amman. 
  The source urged the Political Forces Dialogue Committee and 
the military committee to shoulder their responsibilities at 
this delicate moment and put an end to these reckless acts which 
only aim at obstructing the ongoing efforts to implement the 
pledge and accord document and at endangering the unity of the 
homeland and its Armed Forces.

  [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee [PFDC] has 
approved a statement and a decision was made to broadcast it 
yesterday, 14 Ramadan [24 February]. Regrettably, however, the 
PFDC rapporteur was informed that it would not be broadcast. 
The PFDC, which regrets this, hopes that this will not be 
repeated. Following is the text of the statement: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Statement issued by the PFDC: 
  The PFDC's meeting last night continued until a later hour. 
The committee continued its meeting this morning to review the 
developments in the national arena, particularly the serious 
political and media deterioration. The continuation of such 
deterioration will expose the homeland to serious dangers. 
  The PFDC had hoped that with the final signing of the 
document in Amman all parties would move ahead to implement its 
provisions and that the committee would then embark on its tasks 
represented by following up and supervising the implementation. 
However, it was surprised to see the continuous military and 
media escalation. 
  As the PFDC condemns these irresponsible acts, it appeals to 
the political and military leaders in the state to shoulder 
their national responsibilities, to take firm and swift measures 
to contain the situation, and to stop the escalation. It also 
asks the competent quarters to expeditiously hold investigations 
into what took place, to name those responsible, to reveal this 
to the people, and to return the military situation to normal. 
  All parties must shoulder this historic responsibility 
before 
God, the people, and our Arab and Islamic nation and be equal to 
it unaffected by narrow considerations. 
  The PFDC appeals to the people from all walks of life to 
stand against any action that threatens the homeland's unity and 
safety and to foil the attempts of the advocates of sedition who 
aim at harming the homeland. 
  The PFDC decided to form follow-up committees as follows: 
  1. To set up a military-political committee to follow up the 
efforts aimed at halting the deterioration. The committee 
comprises: Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu- Shawarib, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani, Jarallah 'Umar, Dr. Qasim Sallam, Colonel Husayn 
Sharaf (?al-Kifri), and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif. 
  2. To set up a media committee which comprises: 
'Abd-al-Malik Mansur, Abu-Bakr Badhib, 'Abd-al-Qadir 
(?al-Qiyari), Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik al-Mutawwakil, and 
Muhammad Rawah Sa'id. 
  3. To set up a security committee which comprises: 
Brigadier General Ghalib (?Mutahhir) al-Qamashya, Colonel Ahmad 
al-Himsi, Colonel Ahmad Salim 'Ubayd, Colonel 'Ali Qasim 
al-Mansur, Colonel 'Ali Ahmad al-Hubaysi, and Colonel 'Abdallah 
Ahmad al-Kibsi. 
  The PFDC also decided to hold its next meeting in the Abyan 
Governorate on Saturday and to address a message to the prime 
minister to remind him of the dates fixed in the accord document 
which begin immediately after its signing in accordance with the 
provisions of the document. 
  We ask Almighty God to preserve Yemen -- land and people -- 
and to protect us from harm. God is our best supporter. 
  [Signed] The Popular Forces Dialogue Committee, Sanaa 
  [Dated] 24 February 1994

  [Text] Aden, 28 Feb (MENA)-- The military situation and 
developments in Yemen were discussed in Aden yesterday evening 
by a joint military committee in the presence of Defense 
Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir. 
  During the meeting, the committee expressed the hope that 
efforts will succeed in putting all the remaining tense areas 
under control, returning all military units to pre-crisis 
positions, and showing these units' commitment to the 
committee's instructions in accordance with the authority 
entrusted to it by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  The committee's official spokesman announced that the 
committee-- composed of the Yemeni-Omani-Jordanian 
commission--has met in Sanaa and Aden in the presence of the 
U.S. and French military attaches. It agreed to return all the 
units that had left their posts during the crisis to their 
original stations, stop the clashes that have occurred in 
certain areas, prevent the setting up of new posts on public 
roads, and remove those newly set up posts, and prohibit any 
military movement unless the Joint Military Committee approves 
it. 
  The spokesman stated that the committee will undertake 
observation duties and supervise the implementation of its 
decision as of today, Monday.

place and date not given] 
  [Text] Less than 24 hours after the signing by the 
president and the vice president of the document giving a 
mandate to the joint military committee to tackle the 
deterioration of the military and security situation and the 
implementation of the security and military aspects of the 
pledge and accord document, we were surprised by the 
irresponsible behavior on the part of the giants' [al-'Amaliqah] 
forces. This behavior was represented by their attack on the 
36th Infantry Battalion of the Unity [al-Wahdah] Brigade 
stationed in Mudiyah Province in Abyan Governorate. The 
al-'Amaliqah forces used in their barbarous attack Katyusha 
missile launchers, tanks and artillery, as well as other medium 
and light weapons. This attack targeting the 36th Battalion was 
accompanied by another military attack, targeting towns, 
villages and small villages in Mudiyah Province, when military 
units of the al-'Amaliqah forces carried out intensive shelling 
of peaceful inhabitants.

<F P=106> ["Text" of cable from the Sanaa commands of the GPC to the </F>
members and chairman of the Presidential Council; date not given] 
  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and secretary general of the 
General People's Congress [GPC), and respected brother members 
of the Presidential Council: Our Yemeni people are experiencing 
one of the most critical and important stages they have faced 
throughout their protracted militant history, during which they 
succeeded, through the sacrifices and the struggle of their 
valiant sons, to wrest one victory after the other during their 
blessed revolutionary march. Our people managed to wipe out the 
despotic imamate regime, to expel the odious colonialism from 
our pure land with the eruption of their glorious 26 September 
and 14 October Yemeni revolution, and to restore their cherished 
unity on 22 May 1990, and realize their democratic and ambitious 
achievement on 27 April 1993, which exemplifies the Yemeni 
people's generous offering. 
  Our people who have scored these victories are capable of 
protecting and safeguarding them, irrespective of the crises and 
the fierce attacks by the enemies of their revolution and of 
their unity and democratic gains, and those who advocate a 
return to the abhorent partitioning era. 
  Under these circumstances, the Sanaa GPC commands held a 
meeting last night to discuss the crisis that has been besetting 
our people over the past six months, and the deterioration in 
the quality of our people's daily lives and the recent 
breakdowns in the military area. 
  While they voice deep concern over these breakdowns, the 
Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they abide by the national 
constants of the revolution, unity, and democracy, stress the 
importance of complete abidance by the contents of the document 
of pledge and accord and the need for the coalition parties, in 
particular, and the other parties and national forces in general 
to carry out serious and sincere work to implement its 
provisions with a one-man team spirit and a united political 
will, and to translate it into practise and immediately start to 
return the military situation to what it used to be before 19 
August to avoid sedition, prevent the differences becoming 
further entrenched and the crisis from being exacerbated, as 
well as having the political leadership meet and reactivate the 
state's executive and legislative bodies to have them carry out 
their duties in accordance with the Constitution, and the 
respect for constitutional legitimacy which is a gain for our 
Yemeni masses. 
  The Sanaa GPC commands also stress the importance of 
immediate action to enhance the efforts that state leaders and 
institutions are exerting in a cohesive manner to end the 
people's living tribulation which resulted from the crisis, and 
end the mad increase in prices. 
  The Sanaa GPC commands in these blessed days appeal to the 
GPC command and to all the political parties to fear God when 
they deal with their people and homeland. We must all work 
united to avoid our people being dragged into the abyss which 
will benefit only the enemies of the homeland who seriously seek 
to harm its unity and democractic gains. From this premise, we 
have to renew our victories along our national march in keeping 
with the faith we have always placed in our people that they 
will remain loyal to the martyrs, to the principles of the 
immortal revolution, and to the blessed unity. 
  In conclusion, the Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they 
will diligently and seriously work out of conviction and will 
exert all efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord 
and to cooperate with all the honest national forces to overcome 
all obstacles and decislvely tackle all the impediments that may 
hamper the implementation of the document. We ask God to grant 
success to all in service of the homeland's welfare, stability, 
and prosperity.

  [Text] Sanaa, March 1 (AFP)--A Yemeni defence ministry 
spokesman here Tuesday accused southern troops of shelling a 
region of Abyan province and denied that northern soldiers were 
to blame. 
  Earlier Aden radio, quoting another senior official at the 
ministry, said troops of the former North Yemen had launched an 
offensive "against the 36th division of Al-Wahdah brigade and 
against civilians" at Mudiyah, in Abyan. 
  The northern forces used tanks, artillery and multiple 
rocket- launchers, charged the radio in the south's main city. 
  However, the ministry spokesman in Sanaa said that "forces 
under elements influenced by the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
shelled inhabitants of Mudiyah with heavy artillery late Monday." 
  The Aden-based YSP is led by Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, a southerner and chief political rival of President 'Ali 
Abdallah Salih, who is based in Sanaa. 
  The latest accusations came after Jordanian and Omani 
mediators announced Monday that northerners and southerners had 
agreed to measures to halt fighting which has cost at least 20 
lives in the past week in Abyan alone. 
  The country, formerly divided into North Yemen and 
communist- 
ruled South Yemen, was unified in May 1990, though each side 
retains a separate army. 
  A political crisis erupted last August when al-Bid refused 
to 
take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding decentralisation and 
economic, political and military reforms. 
  Al-Bid and Salih signed a reconciliation accord in Jordan on 
February 20, but it has so far failed to end the crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Al-Iryani Proposed To Head a </F>
Yemeni Government Excluding Socialist Party"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Sanaa, Aden, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 
Well-informed sources in the Yemeni capital have said that there 
are rumors about the possibility of entrusting Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani with forming a national unity government whose task is 
to implement the Pledge and Accord Document. However, political 
sources close to the Yemeni Socialist party [YSP] leadership 
stressed that "the party refuses to participate in such a 
government." They expressed their confidence that all the other 
parties would not join a government that includes the General 
People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] and 
excludes the party, because "it would be a partitionist 
government by all standards." 
  This comes in the context of reports that President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih wishes to end the present coalition by excluding 
the YSP, relying on the parliamentary majority the GPC and YRG 
enjoy in the House of Representatives. Especially as former 
South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad turned down a YSP 
offer to head a new government in place of the present 
government headed by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. 
  An opposition sources share the view of a high-ranking YSP 
official that "anyone can form a secessionist government if he 
wants to." But the main current issue is to safeguard unity.

  [Text] Sanaa, 24 Feb (INA) -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, 
Yemeni minister of planning and development and member of the 
General Committee of the General People's Congress [GPC], has 
denied reports that a new Yemeni coalition government will be 
formed soon without the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  In a statement published today by the Bahraini newspaper 
AL-AYYAM, Dr. al-Iryani said these reports are baseless, 
pointing out that the formation of a new Yemeni government is 
presently not a subject of discussion. 
  The paper disclosed that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has invited his "deputy" 'Ali Nasir Muhammad [former 
president of South Yemen] to form a new Yemeni government to 
replace the government of Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the current 
Yemeni prime minister. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, however, rejected 
the offer.

  [Text] Tripoli, 26 Feb (JANA) -- The permanent secretariat 
of the Arab People's Congress condemned the horrible massacre 
that was committed by the Zionist terrorists against people 
performing prayers at Abraham's mosque yesterday morning. 
  In a statement issued by the permanent secretariat of the 
Arab People's Congress yesterday, the secretariat condemns this 
massacre, which embodies the hostility of the Zionist occupation 
and the destruction of the questionable calls for peace that 
some Arabs have followed. 
  The permanent secretariat of the Arab People's Congress 
called on the Arab nation to adopt a serious stance that 
strengthens the support for the Palestinian Arab people and does 
not let it be a helpless prey for the imperialist and Zionist 
forces. 
  The secretariat addressed also a call to the Arab leaders 
and 
heads of Arab liberation movements to make immediate and 
practical moves to support the Palestinian people and express 
the pan-Arab will and use it to put pressures on the UN and 
international organizations so that they condemn the enemy and 
implement international laws to give to the Palestinian people 
the right to recover all their rights.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--Libya has called for an urgent 
Arab summit to discuss Arab affairs and the massacre that Israel 
committed in Hebron on Friday. 
  Jum'ah al-Fazzani, secretary of the Libyan General People's 
Committee for Unity, has stated that he informed Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid of Libya's call, in 
compliance with the requirements of pan-Arab security and as 
part of the Common Arab Defense Pact. 
  In a news conference held last night, al-Fazzani added that 
Israel now, after concluding a deal for F-15 aircraft with the 
United States, has become a threat to the Arab and Islamic 
worlds. He stressed the need to lay down the foundations for a 
true inter- Arab integration agreement in accordance with the 
joint economic cooperation agreement. 
  In his news conference, al-Fazzani emphasized that 
Egyptian-Libyan relations are deep-rooted and serve the 
interests of both the Libyan and Egyptian peoples, thanks to the 
direct ties and deep understanding between the political leaders 
of the two countries. Al-Fazzani pointed out that two countries' 
executive institutions want to put Egyptian-Libyan integration 
into effect in all fields. He noted that a project to link the 
two countries by rail has already started from the Libyan side 
and that a joint oil project also has begun. 
  The Libyan official noted that there is an agreement between 
the two countries that gives their citizens full rights in 
either country. He pointed out that four Egyptian companies are 
working in the (?al-Wigh) project to prepare for settling 
approximately 4 million Egyptians in this agricultural area once 
the infrastructure work has been completed. 
  Al-Fazzani stressed that Libya cares about Egypt's security. 
He added: We will not permit anyone to stay in our country who 
could threaten Egyptian security. On this matter, al-Fazzani 
noted that the Libyan Government has allowed Egyptian 
authorities to inspect all Libyan cars that cross the borders, 
even those with diplomatic license plates. 
  In response to some accusations that Libya was lackadaisical 
about arresting some fugitive Egyptian elements, al-Fazzani 
stressed that Libya does not and will not allow its territory to 
be used in harming Egypt's security because that security is 
part of Libyan Arab security. Therefore, he added, Libya cannot 
allow any harm to be done to Egypt's security directly or 
indirectly. 
  Al-Fazzani also spoke about the conference for the three 
heavenly religions to be held in Tripoli on 12 June and attended 
by Islamic, Christian, and Jewish clerics. He pointed out that 
Libya calls for tolerance and common understanding among the 
heavenly religions and seeks to deepen faith and avoid collision 
among them. He said that as far as the presence of Israeli 
figures at this conference is concerned, the question of who 
will attend is a matter of formality that will be the 
responsibility of the international committee tasked with 
organizing this conference. 
  On the march of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU], al-Fazzani 
disclosed that a Maghreb summit will be held in Tunis in the 
first week of April, adding that the AMU drive will continue 
despite the negative effects on the common Maghreb action 
resulting from the Libyan-Western crisis. He noted that the AMU 
member states have started to set up an Arab Maghreb free zone, 
secure trade exchange, and free movement for citizens using 
identity cards, as part of the rights of citizenship in the 
Maghreb region. 
  On Libya's conflict with Chad over the disputed Aozou 
region, 
al-Fazzani noted that the two countries have mutually agreed to 
refer the matter to the International Court of Justice in the 
Hague. He added that the ruling that the court passed giving 
Chad sovereignty over this region requires executive measures. 
The Libyan official declined to speak further about this matter. 
  Al-Fazzani denied that Libya is responsible for the 
disappearance of Libyan opposition figure Mansur al-Kikhya, who 
disappeared on 10 December 1993 after attending a human rights 
conference in Cairo. He ruled out the possibility of U.S. raids 
against the Libyan Jamahiriyah during the term of current 
Democratic President Bill Clinton. 
  Al-Fazzani emphasized that Libya is ready to open a dialogue 
with the U.S. Administration, provided that the Jamahiriyah's 
sovereignty is respected. He noted that dialogue is the key to 
solving disputes and consolidating international relations, in 
accordance with the UN Charter. 
  Turning to the Lockerbie issue, he noted that the defense 
panel tasked with defending the Libyan suspects involved in this 
case, which is made up of a number of Western lawyers, has 
decided that the guarantees offered by the United States and 
Britain are insufficient and do not ensure the necessary 
impartiality for the trial of its Libyan clients. Therefore, he 
added, the panel recommended that they do not give themselves up.

  [Text] The secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation has summoned the 
ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent members, 
accredited in the Great Jamahiriyah; he told them of the Great 
Jamahiriyah's outrage at the wanton massacre carried out by the 
Zionist occupiers inside the al-Ibrahimi holy shrine against 
worshippers, the sons of the Palestinian Arab people. 
  The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation has asserted the 
need for the UN Security Council to impose harsh sanctions on 
the Zionist entity, not furnish it with any weapons and to 
impose a blockade against it. 
  He stressed, moreover, that if the Council failed to take 
any 
of the abovementioned measures, such a failure would be seen an 
encouragement for the Israelis to perpetrate further massacres 
and annihilate the Palestinian Arab people. 
  The brother secretary has asked the ambassadors to convey 
the 
abovementioned protest to their respective governments.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Zionist terrorists carried out a massacre 
that claimed the lives of dozens of Arab Palestinians, as a part 
of the policy of annihilation pursued by the Israelis against 
the sons of the Arab Palestinian people. [passage omitted] 
  This massacre, which was committed by the Zionists inside 
the 
Tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron and in the middle of the blessed 
month of Ramadan, coincides with what is being publicized as 
peace with the Israelis, which led to direct negotiations 
between Israelis and Arab sides in Washington. It also 
coincides with direct talks between Israelis and officials from 
the Fatah organization to implement what has been labelled as 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Today's incident brought to light 
the falsity of this alleged peace, and exposed the plot that is 
being hatched, which is that what is taking places these days is 
not peace, but a method to force the Arabs to submit 
unconditionally, to destroy their nation, and annihilate their 
people. 
  This massacre also confirms other facts, the most important 
of which are: This massacre represents one aspect of the outcome 
of the so-called Gaza-Jericho Agreement. What has been 
committed by the Zionist occupiers represents the real terrorism 
that has been condemned and denounced by all international norms 
and treaties. This type of terrorism epitomizes the highest 
level of human rights abuses, that the West boasts to safeguard 
and protect. This begs the following question: What will the 
West do about this abhorrent act of terrorism? What will the UN 
Security Council do? This Security Council which is controlled 
by Western countries that claim to hold the torch to combat 
terrorism. These countries also level accusations of terrorism 
against anyone who does not follow their policies and does not 
succumb to their blackmail and orders. 
  The Israelis would not have continued to carry out their 
barbaric massacres and their annihilation of the sons of the 
Arab Palestinian people without the unlimited support lavished 
on them by the West through a supply of arms and funds, and 
through a policy of cover-up of their crimes and turning a blind 
eye on their accumulated arsenals of weapons of mass 
destruction. This policy falls within an alliance between the 
Jews and the Christians against the Arabs and Islam. This 
massacre would not have happened if we did not have some Arabs 
who rushed to recognize their enemy and submit to it.

  [Text] Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, secretary general of the 
Arab League, urgently contacted Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, brother 
leader of the revolution, following the arrival in Cairo of the 
secretary of the General People's Committee. Al-Qadhdhafi 
informed the Arab League's secretary general that the 
Secretariat of the General People's Committee for Unity was in 
the process of submitting a proposal on withdrawing Libya from 
the Arab League to people's congresses since the League had 
failed to offer anything to Arab peoples. 
  Member states of the League have participated in 
implementing 
a resolution, issued by the crusader enemy, on a blockade of the 
people of the Great Jamahiriyah. The League has even been 
unable to amend its Charter and bring about Arab union, and it 
has not changed the Arab map while the map of the world had 
changed. 
  The Arab League has not been able to change its stance and 
has failed to resolve the Somalian crisis which was left to 
Christian countries. It has also failed to resolve the Yemeni 
problem, so much so that the U.S. President has started to issue 
orders to Yemeni forces to retreat to their barracks. It has 
also failed to do anything for the Lebanese Arab people and 
their occupied land, the Syrian Arab people and their occupied 
territories, and the annihilation of the Palestinian people. It 
has failed to make member countries respect its Charters; the 
joint defense pact was not applied during the attacks on Libya, 
Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Tunisia. 
  All of that was followed by the completion of the 
destruction 
of the League's Charter, resumption of relations with the enemy, 
and the lifting of the boycott when some members of the League 
announced that they would supply the enemy with energy and some 
have hosted and met the enemy's leaders. The Arab League has 
also failed to bring about a reconciliation among some Arabs: 
We could see Arabs and their enemies embracing, while the Arabs 
refused to meet each other. What is taking place is the Arabs' 
submission to U.S. and Israeli force that is imposed on them and 
the Arabs' unconditional surrender. 
  The Arabs have failed in international gatherings and the 
League has not succeeded in imposing a blockade on the Israelis, 
banning arms sales to them, and severing relations with them, 
while that is being applied against Arabs; they are being 
disarmed and banned from obtaining arms, as is the case with 
Libya and Iraq. 
  Therefore, the Libyan people are seriously thinking about 
leaving the Arab League so that Arabs will be able to welcome 
their brother Israel. On the basis of the communique submitted 
by the Secretariat of the General People's Committee for Unity 
to the Arab League, the League's secretary general urgently 
contacted the the brother leader of the revolution. 
  [Begin recording] ['Abd al-Majid] Your Excellency Colonel, I 
am Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Yes [words indistinct]. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Seasons greetings. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Good wishes. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] God willing, you are well. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] Well, thanks to God. How are you? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Your Excellency Colonel, Unity Secretary 
brother Jum'ah al-Fazzani, and brother... [end recording, 
interrupted by announcer] 
  'Abd-al-Majid asks him not to submit the issue to the 
people's congresses in the Great Jamahiriyah until a meeting 
between Libya and the Arab League takes place. 
  [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Majid] I would like to see you 
and 
talk about it before you make a decision. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] We appreciate your personal efforts and your 
loyalty to this nation. You are a brother to us. However, on 
the whole the Arab situation is like this. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I know. He [not further identified] told me 
about the letter and the cable Your Excellency sent. This came 
at the right time. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] My brother, Israelis and Arabs are embracing 
each other while Arabs are not meeting each other. This does 
not make sense. Does it make sense that we embrace our bitter 
enemy every day, while the Arabs are not meeting each other? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] That is right. 
  [Al-Qadhdhafi] It is a scandal that Christians and the West 
go to Somalia, an Arab country, to solve its problems. Yemen is 
a member of the Arab League and an Arab country. Now there are 
military concentrations, and the U.S. President is saying that 
the military units have to return to their barracks. Muscat is 
inviting the foreign minister... [end recording, interrupted by 
announcer] 
  Brothers, that was the secretary general of the Arab League 
urgently contacting the brother leader of the revolution 
following the arrival of the secretary of the General People's 
Committee for Unity in Cairo, who has informed the Arab League 
secretary general that the Secretariat of the General People's 
Committee for Unity is about to submit a proposal on Libya's 
withdrawal from the League to peoples' congresses after the 
League's failure to offer anything to Arab people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina has entered a new 
phase with NATO's air strike on and downing of four Serb 
fighters. With this air strike, NATO resorted to its first true 
military operation since forming after World War II. The second 
Security Council resolution on Bosnia-Herzegovina has been 
implemented. During the past two years, the UN Security Council 
has issued 19 resolutions on Bosnia and until yesterday's air 
strike, only the resolution on the arms embargo, which was 
limited to the Muslims, was being implemented. 
  The fist question that comes to mind is: Why were most of 
the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia not implemented and 
why was the resolution banning flights by hostile planes over 
Bosnia implemented only yesterday, over a year after it was 
approved? 
  Political analysts believe that the implementation or the 
suspension of the Security Council resolutions on Bosnia stemmed 
primarily from the political recklessness of international 
powers and their agreements backstage. Basically, this issue 
can be studied within the context of the cooperation and rivalry 
between the Western countries and Russia. 
  The approval of the Security Council resolutions on the 
Bosnian crisis and the implementation or violation of these 
resolutions form the most important pillar in the West's 
cooperation with Russia. The flood of Russian arms to Serbia and 
the dispatch of similar Western arms to Croatia--despite the 
international sanctions--are examples of how the resolution on 
the arms embargo was violated by the belligerent sides in the 
Bosnian crisis, with mutual connivance by the West and Russia. 
  The arms embargo on the Muslims, which was pursued under the 
strong control of the West and Russia, is another example of 
this cooperation, which shows how the world powers have a 
uniform political inclination in their hostility toward the 
oppressed Muslims in Bosnia. This cooperation between the West 
and Russia recently adopted the character of a political 
transaction. Russia's political support for the Serbs after the 
NATO ultimatum and its preventing the NATO air strike against 
the Serbs' heavy gun bases were among the concessions that the 
West granted to Moscow so that Russia's President Yeltsin could 
use these for domestic consumption against his rivals. 
  Yesterday's support by Russia for the NATO air strike on the 
Serb fighters is a concession that Russia is giving to the West. 
Although Russia supports the Serbs, it cannot agree with their 
impudence in violating the resolution on the no-fly zone and in 
their air strike on two Muslim-inhabited cities, especially when 
Moscow voted for this resolution. 
  Next to the cooperation between the West and Russia in the 
former Yugoslavia, there is also rivalry between the two, which 
has recently become more visible. Russia's powerful entry onto 
the scene toward the end of the period specified in NATO's 
ultimatum two weeks ago, gathering the hostile side's heavy guns 
from around Sarajevo, and Moscow's overt support for the Bosnian 
Serbs form one of the clearest examples of the rivalry between 
Russia and the West in the Balkans. It recalls the Cold War 
era's bloc system. 
  The U.S. proposal to form a type of confederation with the 
Republic of Croatia on the one side and the Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats on the other and the two sides' [as heard] call on 
Washington to examine the situation are considered to form a 
reciprocal step by the West, which is trying to place the 
Bosnian Muslims within an irreversible new framework and under 
the umbrella of Western support and political influence. 
  Political analysts believe that while cooperation and 
rivalry 
rule relations between the West and Russia in the Bosnian 
crisis, the recent NATO air strike on the Serb fighters took 
place with another objective in mind that is not opposed by 
Russia either. Overshadowing the savage act by the Zionist 
forces in the massacre at the Abrahamite shrine may be the main 
objective behind NATO's delayed attack on the Serb planes. The 
Zionist regime's thoughtless act has sparked off dangerous 
repercussions for the West's interests in the Islamic world and 
the West is trying to resort to another commotion in a bid to 
distract the world of Islam from Tel Aviv's horrific crime.

Group] 
  [Text] Reaction by Muslim circles to the recent crime by 
the Zionist regime of violating the sanctity of the Abrahamite 
shrine and massacring the Palestinian worshippers revealed the 
nature and character of many Arab regimes and weakened their 
political bases. The student and popular demonstrations 
throughout Egypt, which started a few days ago, speak of the 
deep Islamic bond that the Egyptian people have with their 
Palestinian brothers and shows the different stances by the 
Egyptian people and by the Egyptian Government in their approach 
to the Zionist regime. 
  The Egyptian Government, which knows this reality more than 
anyone else, adopted a progressive position immediately after 
Tel Aviv's recent crime to politically exploit the issue and to 
avoid the negative repercussions that the Zionist regime's acts 
could have at home. Condemning the massacre of the worshippers 
at the Abrahamite shrine, it called on international 
organizations to seriously examine the issue and take punitive 
measures against the Zionist regime. 
  But this stance, which did not conform with the nature and 
principles of the foreign policy of Husni Mubarak's regime, 
adopted a contradictory nature with the intensification of the 
Egyptian people's protests against the recent crime by the 
Zionist regime. The Egyptian police's clashes with demonstrators 
protesting against the Zionist regime and the killing of 12 
demonstrators [as heard] showed the contradictory behavior of 
the Cairo regime and revealed its accord with the Zionist regime. 
  Political observers believe that the Egyptian Government 
cannot agree with the Egyptian people's feelings of solidarity 
with the Palestinian dream and walk hand-in-hand with the 
Zionist enemy at the same time. These political observers 
believe that with their people's reaction to the Zionist 
regime's crime, the Arab governments that have been drawn into a 
compromise with the Zionist regime based on an incorrect 
assessment have realized for the umpteenth time that the path of 
compromise with the Zionist regime that they have chosen to 
tread does not conform with the people's views and that these 
regimes are at a crossroads, where they must choose between 
their people and relations with the Zionist regime. 
  What is certain is that accord among Arab governments and 
their people will not only help strengthen these regimes, but 
will also grant them immense popular support, which can play an 
important role when it comes to showing the direction in which 
political developments and processes should move.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Atif 'Umar: "The Massacre in the Ibrahimi </F>
Mosque is Not the Last Criminal Act Against the Palestinian 
People"] 
  [Text] Anyone who believes that the horrendous crime 
committed by some Israeli terrorists against Palestinian 
worshipers will be the last criminal act in the occupied Arab 
territory is mistaken. The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict 
is nothing if not a tedious roster of acts of violence and 
terror by Zionist gangs. This has been the case since British 
colonialism implanted Israel on Palestine's soil. 
  The atrocity is reminiscent of terrorist operations carried 
out by Jewish extremists against the Palestinian people since 
the beginning of the occupation of the Palestinian homeland and 
the establishment of the State of Israel. 
  Repeated UN resolutions on the partition of Palestine 
between 
the Arabs and the Israelis and the right of the Palestinian 
people to self-determination have been systematically ignored by 
Israel. Israel continued its criminal acts against the 
Palestinian people, safe in the knowledge that the punishment it 
is subjected to after each operation never goes beyond the 
rhetoric of denunciation for these operations and a perfunctory 
note that it should refrain from such acts in the future. 
Israel gains from such acts. It seized miles of Palestinian 
land, with the inhabitants forced to flee under pressure by 
Zionist gangs. 
  Zionist operations in Palestine began with the well-known 
Dayr Yasin massacre, only to be followed by atrocities in Nasr 
al-Din, Bayt al-Khuri, al-Zaytun, and Bayt Dras. Al-Aqsa mosque 
was not spared. Monasteries were not immune to attacks by 
Israeli gangs. Some of these gangs attacked the Greek Orthodox 
monastery in April 1990, occupied it, and converted it into 
barracks for Jewish settlers. The number of settlers has been 
constantly on the rise, particularly since Israel succeeded in 
obtaining $10 billion in loan guarantees from the Bush 
administration. The loan was used to help settle the new 
immigrants who flocked to Israel from the former Soviet Union 
following the collapse of communism, as well as from 
poverty-stricken East European countries. 
  There is no doubt that the thousands who live in the 
settlements built by successive Israeli governments represent a 
source of continued tension in the occupied Arab territory. It 
is in these settlements that acts of aggression carried out by 
the armed Jewish settlers against the unarmed native population 
are planned. It is from these settlements that these acts are 
mounted. 
  Therefore, we categorically conclude that the massacre at 
the 
Ibrahimi Mosque against the Palestinian people will not be the 
last criminal act carried out by the settlers. This is because 
the settlers knew beforehand that reaction to their aggression 
would not exceed a strongly or even mildly worded resolution or 
statement, words that will have no perceptible mark on the 
political or economic life of Israeli citizens or governments. 
As long as the international community fails to assume its 
required duty vis a vis this steady stream of aggression, such 
attacks will persist. 
  We must say that the timing of this ugly crime cannot be 
lightly taken. Muslim worshipers were mowed down as they stood 
in piety before God. The fasting martyrs did not have stones in 
their hands for Israel to use as a pretext for carrying out its 
aggression. Most were elderly people who simply showed up for 
prayers at the prescribed time and place. 
  Israel's masks have fallen. Its unconvincing pretexts, which 
it routinely cites following every aggression against innocent 
Palestinians, have been invalidated. This time, the attacked 
Palestinians were not engaged in resistance against the 
occupation or pelting Israeli armored vehicles with stones. 
  Yes, all the masks have fallen. International public opinion 
can now see that it has been deluded into thinking that Israel 
was serious in seeking peaceful coexistence with the Arabs and 
earnest in wanting to make lasting peace with the Arabs, while 
all that time it was the Arabs who scrambled for peace and 
strove long and hard for its realization. 
  Despite the ugliness of the crime committed by the Israeli 
settlers against innocent Palestinians, we cannot absolve 
ourselves of responsibility for the atrocity. The absence of 
honest and serious Arab coordination was the crack in the Arab 
wall, through which Israel and others advanced their most odious 
schemes and got away with plots to destroy the Arab (?identity) 
and even the very faith of Islam. Serious and collective action 
is indispensable to confront these schemes that are now laid 
bare, shorn of their last bit of modesty.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--The Muslim Brotherhood group, 
whose activities are banned in Egypt, has issued a statement 
denouncing the bombing of a church in Kasrawan, Lebanon. The 
statement also denounces the criminal hands which terrorize the 
public and stab Muslims in their backs as they kneel down to 
pray. 
  The statement says that enemies are hatching conspiracies to 
fan the flames of sedition among our people. We should foil 
these conspiracies through the unity of our ranks and the

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 21 
February carries two reports on the response to possible 
terrorist threats by foreign embassies, particularly the U.S. 
Embassy. 
  The first report, written by Khalid Dawud, appears on pages 
5-8. The 3,000-word report has a compound headline: "ROSE 
AL-YUSUF Uncovers Secret Meetings of the Foreign Communities; 
U.S. Security Patrols To Protect 12,000 Americans From 
Extremists; A Meeting in the UK Embassy: The British Did Not 
Panic; The German Embassy: Translating the Extremist Statements 
So That the Germans May Decide for Themselves; The French 
Embassy: These Are Internal Affairs." 
  Beneath the headlines, the magazine publishes two miniature, 
mostly unintelligible, photocopies of presumed U.S. Embassy 
documents. The first it describes as "security instructions 
issued by the U.S. Embassy Security Office to the members of the 
community." The other, on which the words "USIS Cairo" is 
discernible in boldface, is described as "an invitation by the 
U.S. Embassy for a meeting of the U.S. community and journalists 
to discuss the statement issued by the extremists." 
  The reports start out by saying: 
  "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo has convened two meetings of the 
U.S. community in Cairo to ask them to raise their security 
awareness and remain alert because `the situation may change.' 
  "The first meeting was held at the embassy headquarters in 
Garden City last Sunday. The second was held at the American 
School in al- Ma'adi on Tuesday amid strict security measures 
and with a request by officials of the Embassy Media Office that 
nothing be published about what takes place in these meetings. 
  "What is peculiar is that the number of Americans who cared 
to attend the first embassy meetings did not exceed 50-60 
people. This means that the embassy is more afraid than the 
community. Furthermore, many of those who came to the meeting 
were journalists who were eager to get a briefing about the 
situation. 
  "U.S. Embassy Security Official Robert O'Brien, who headed 
the meeting, said: `This place is safe to live in, but this 
situation may be about to change.' Despite his assurances that 
the embassy does not advise U.S. nationals to leave Egypt or not 
to visit it, he pointed to the seriousness of the three recent 
terrorist statements, signed by the Islamic Group-Egypt." 
  The report summarizes the statements recently issued by the 
Islamic Group and goes back to the remarks made to the U.S. 
community by the U.S. Embassy security official, this time 
identified as "O'Brien Lee." 
  It says that the U.S. official "expressed particular concern 
over the second statement by the Islamic Group, `because it was 
the most specific' regarding the threat against foreigners." 
  The U.S. official added "that they (the terrorists) will not 
have any credibility unless they carry out their threats, which 
is particularly worrying." 
  The report cites the U.S. official as warning U.S. nationals 
to be alert to changes in their environment, avoid calling 
attention to themselves, and alter their daily routines. 
  The report says: "The meeting also brought the revelation 
that the Americans, even prior to the latest terrorist threats, 
were running `vehicled patrols' involving 11 roving cars 
carrying patrols of U.S. security men in al-Ma'adi and downtown." 
  The report then discusses the reactions of the UK, German, 
and French Embassies to the threat. 
  UK Press Spokesman Martin Day is cited as saying that, "Of 
course, these threats have to be taken very seriously." Day 
notes that a meeting of representatives of the UK community in 
Egypt was held "last week." The purpose of that meeting was "to 
inform the community of the content of the recent statements by 
the extremists." The report cites Day as saying that "most 
community members have not yet panicked because they know that 
the situation so far is reassuring." 
  Moving on to the German reaction, the report says that "a 
German Embassy employee said that what is going on now is a `fax 
war' and that this is part of a clear strategy that the 
[extremist] groups are following to cause panic." German 
Embassy officials have met German teachers and businessmen 
living in Egypt to brief them on the latest developments. The 
embassy also translated the extremists' statements and provided 
the community with it so that "they can decide for themselves 
what has to be done," the report notes. 
  The report then says that the French Embassy, caring for a 
community of 5,000 French nationals, remains "the most reserved" 
of all embassies. A press spokesman for that embassy expressed 
a desire "not to comment on Egyptian domestic affairs." The 
report cites the spokeswoman that "even if meetings were held of 
the French community, this would be an internal matter." The 
report cites, without elaboration, that "similar instructions" 
have been issued by the Italian Embassy. 
  The report concludes by saying: "The atmosphere in the 
foreign embassies and communities is one of wait and see. 
Either the security forces will succeed in their daunting task 
of eradicating terror, or the terrorists will manage to stage 
renewed attacks. Any operations, small or big, will simply 
cause panic and instability, a matter that will harm the 
ordinary people even more than the government." 
  A 1,300-word unattributed report entitled "How is the 
Protection of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Organized?" appears on 
page 8 of the same 21 February issues of the Cairo weekly 
magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF. The report begins with a description of 
the U.S. Embassy's security arrangements: 
  "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is open for only five days a 
week. 
But the Regional Security Office, located on the sixth floor of 
the ugly cement building, is manned 24 hours a day by 30 Marines 
and 300 Egyptian security men, who are positioned in various 
parts of the embassy. 
  "Not all the Americans working at the embassy are equal. 
This is particularly true for those who are allowed to move 
between the ninth and 15th floor of the new cement building, 
where the most important embassy offices are located, including 
the yet empty ambassador's office, still waiting for the new 
ambassador. 
  "The Security Office is responsible for the following: 
contacting Egyptian police and other security organs; providing 
advice to the ambassador on all matters of security; providing 
protection to all distinguished U.S. visitors; making 
investigations on behalf of U.S. legal authorities on background 
matters; making investigations into matters of terrorism, crime, 
and espionage; supervising the embassy's local 300-strong 
security force; running the security and alarm systems at the 
embassy; supervising the Marines; providing information about 
the security background of the employees and their revenue 
['a'idatihim; a possible misprint of 'a'ilatihim, meaning 
families]; supervising the emergency plan in the event that the 
embassy is in danger; protecting all classified material; 
supervising security arrangements for U.S. residential quarters; 
and providing information for the U.S. business community on 
security-related matters, an effort coordinated by the U.S. 
State Department." 
  The report then notes that the Marine unit in the embassy is 
"one of the largest in the world" and that its personnel "are 
stationed in eight different positions in various parts of the 
embassy and at the gates." 
  The local security force, however, is responsible for 
protecting the main embassy gates and the residential quarters, 
and runs 11 car patrols in al-Ma'adi and the downtown areas 
around the clock. 
  The report notes that the Security Office has four stages of 
alert--white, yellow, orange, and red--corresponding to the 
intensity of the danger involved. The report says that "the 
embassy advises everyone to be on yellow alert." 
  The report then cites the U.S. State Department's travel 
advisory about Egypt and concludes by saying that "the U.S. 
Embassy in Cairo has asked U.S. nationals visiting Egypt or 
residing in the country to raise their security alertness and to 
avoid calling unnecessary attention to themselves or their 
activities."

  [Text] Aswan, 28 Feb (MENA)--Security forces killed five 
terrorists today following a chase through farm areas in Aswan. 
  The incident took place during sweeps that began last night 
in Aswan. Security organs killed three wanted terrorists last 
night after they attacked a policeman. 
  According to security sources, the dead men were dangerous 
terrorists wanted by the police in connection with several 
crimes. 
  The eight terrorists attacked the sentry at the license 
office in Idfu yesterday evening, captured his rifle, and fled 
in a minitruck toward the village of (Kalj al-Jabal). The 
security forces immediately chased them and managed to kill 
three of them. The remaining terrorists hid in a sugar cane 
plantation. A police force led by Major General Sami 
'Abd-al-Jawad, assistant to the interior minister and director 
of the Security Department in Aswan, surrounded them and 
exchanged fire. As day broke today, the police force raided the 
sugar cane plantation and found the bodies of the five other 
terrorists, the sentry's stolen rifle, and some weapons and 
ammunition. During the manhunt and raid, two policemen were 
martyred and another was injured and taken to the central 
hospital in Idfu.

<F P=106> [News conference held by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat with </F>
unidentified correspondents in Algiers on 28 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] ['Arafat] As I said a little earlier, the talks 
focused on the situation in our occupied land, particularly 
after the abominable crime and vile conspiracy which took place 
inside the holy Ibrahim's mosque, as a result of which 65 
martyrs fell and 256 people were injured by Israeli armed 
gangsters in collaboration with some units of the Israeli army. 
[passage omitted] 
  Naturally, this has left bad and negative effects on the 
peace process as a whole, because it proves that the Israelis do 
not want peace. They are now retracting everything they have 
signed. I would like to recall that Rabin said that there were 
no sacred schedules. Now, there are no sacred clauses, and 
tomorrow he will say there are no sacred agreements. This 
indicates that they are retracting what has been agreed on and 
what we signed in Washington last year. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you presided over an 
emergency meeting of the PLO's Executive Committee yesterday to 
look into Washington's invitation. 
  ['Arafat] A meeting of the Palestinian leadership. 
  [Correspondent] Of course, the Palestinian leadership to 
look 
into Washington's invitation and the measures which the Israeli 
authorities have decided to take in the aftermath of the 
massacre of Ibrahim's mosque. What was the final decision about 
these two issues? 
  ['Arafat] I am quickly going back after my meeting with the 
president [Zeroual] to continue that meeting. The meeting has 
not ended yet. The meeting began yesterday and it will be 
continued today. 
  [Correspondent] Does this mean that you are waiting for the 
Security's Council's final resolution? 
  ['Arafat] One of the things we are looking forward to is a 
clear resolution by the Security Council condemning the crime 
and setting up an investigating committee. More important than 
that is international protection for our people. This was 
stated in the agreement which said "temporary international 
presence" [last three words spoken in English] which means 
temporary international presence, and we insist that that 
presence should take place as soon as possible so that we may 
rest assured that our people can be protected from those 
conspiracies, massacres, and trials. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency the president, what do you 
say to the Israeli announcement on the imminent release of about 
1,000 Palestinians, and the issue of disarming the Jewish 
settlers? 
  ['Arafat] At the beginning they said "some". 
  [Correspondent] Eight hundred or 1,000? 
  ['Arafat] No, no, no. I am talking about the armed settlers. 
He said he would disarm some Israeli settlers; some, some, some, 
i.e. a few. Have you paid attention? We say the settlers 
should be disarmed of all weapons, because carrying weapons 
should not be allowed; second, I agreed with Peres in the Cairo 
meeting on this number and more. Therefore, he brought nothing 
new. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President, following the 
Ibrahim mosque massacre, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon suspended 
their consultations in the peace talks. What is the Palestinian 
stance in the light of the recent developments on the 
Palestinian, Arab, and international arenas? 
  ['Arafat] I have recalled all our negotiators not only from 
Washington. I have invited our negotiators to yesterday's and 
today's meetings, why? To discuss with the brother members and 
heads of the delegations in Taba, Cairo, Paris, and Washington. 
  We enormously thank Algeria, the president, government, 
leadership, and people for the fraternal, continued, and 
constant stances which it adopts with the Palestinian fighters 
at the different levels. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The discussions of the PLO Executive Committee have 
resumed today at the PLO headquarters in Tunis in anticipation 
of a firm resolution from the UN Security Council following the 
massacre at the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. 
  Within this context the PLO leaders are expecting the UN 
Security Council to issue a resolution that will guarantee the 
effective protection of the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories before the final answer is announced to President 
Bill Clinton's request that the negotiations should be resumed 
in Washington.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member Dr. </F>
Samir Ghawshah, in Tunis, by radio correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi, 
in the studio; from the "With the Events" program--live] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive 
Committee member, good evening. 
  [Ghawshah] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] The PLO Executive Committee is holding intensive 
consultations and contacts. Has the Palestinian leadership 
reached a firm decision on the future of Israel-Palestinian 
negotiations? 
  [Ghawshah] The Palestinian leadership held a meeting 
yesterday to deal with various developments. The meeting was 
also attended by the heads of the delegations to the 
negotiations in Taba, Paris, and Washington. The Executive 
Committee studied the positions that it received. In fact, the 
position we received from the Israeli Government and Rabin was 
disappointing. 
  The Israeli Government's decisions were not up to the level 
of the incident and did not remove the obstacles to the peace 
process. The Executive Committee and the Palestinian leadership 
studied this issue, and they will follow up these various 
developments tonight. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah: Will the Palestinian side 
respond to the U.S. call to hold bilateral meetings in 
Washington? 
  [Ghawshah] This depends on what the negotiations will deal 
with. It also depends on whether there are new issues, and 
whether it is only a change in the venues of meetings and in the 
external appearance rather than the substance. There are many 
issues that must be discussed with the U.S. Administration in 
order to learn about the objective, level, and timing of such 
meetings. 
  The PLO is thus ready, in principle, to participate in the 
negotiations. However, we believe that the issue is not whether 
to participate in negotiations and accept the U.S. invitation. 
The issue is at what level such negotiations will be held and 
what topics will be discussed. The Palestinian leadership will 
also discuss this issue in tonight's meeting. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: Your colleague, PLO Executive 
Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, today said the PLO will not 
resume negotiations unless the settlers are disarmed. Is this 
an official decision by the PLO leadership? 
  [Ghawshah] This issue was also discussed. Several requests 
were proposed. We are of the view that disarming the settlers 
is a basic and necessary issue. The forces that maintain 
internal security and public order are regular forces, whether 
the Israeli Army troops or, when the withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho is completed, the Palestinian security and police forces. 
  Hence, we believe that keeping the settlers under arms is in 
violation of both the law and all agreements. This is a basic 
issue. We also believe that the real threats to security are in 
fact threats to Palestinian security. This is contrary to Prime 
Minister Rabin's allegations that Israel wants to guarantee its 
own security. Evidence has shown that the Palestinian people 
are the ones who need protection and security guarantees. 
  It is not the first time that the Palestinians have been 
attacked by settlers, whether in the form of stopping traffic on 
roads or attacking defenseless citizens in their houses and 
cars. We see no logical explanation for the Israeli 
Government's position that permits extremist organizations to 
carry arms. These issues should be discussed, whether with the 
United States or other parties before finally deciding on 
whether to participate in the Washington negotiations. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir: What are the PLO leadership's 
irreversible terms to resume the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations? 
  [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership has proven its good 
intentions, demonstrated great flexibility, and made many 
concessions. It still demands that there should be a commitment 
to implementing the agreement and to the dates set. The only 
issue in the Declaration of Principles that needs no 
negotiations is the dates to begin and end the withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho. Rabin made this a negotiable issue because it 
is not a sacred issue. What terms and issues are we talking 
about? 
  We believe that the continuation of these policies by Rabin 
and his government will deprive the negotiations of their role 
and feasibility. The basic issue is that a real and serious 
change should be made in the Israeli Government's position on 
the peace process and on implementing the agreements. We also 
believe that foremost among these issues must be a clear Israeli 
position on the settlers and disarming them. Protection for the 
Palestinians must be secured and UN observers should be put in 
place in order to maintain Palestinian security and prevent 
encroachments on it, whether on the part of the settlers or 
through the methods used by the Israeli Army, which has killed 
or wounded dozens of our people's sons. 
  At a time when the Palestinians are prevented from 
expressing 
their feelings or burying their martyrs, we see on television 
pictures of settlers wandering freely with their weapons. Thus, 
what negotiations are we talking about? 
  We pose a basic question: What peace does Rabin want? Does 
he want peace that will guarantee security, stability, and 
prosperity for Israel, or does he wish to continue his policies 
that appease the Likud, the settlers, and others. This 
appeasement cannot be part of a peace that takes into account 
party, internal, and electoral considerations. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the last question is: Do you think 
that a meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat could facilitate the resumption of the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
  [Ghawshah] We believe that the first step should be serious 
and practical decisions by Rabin on the massacre and the savage 
crime perpetrated against our people's sons in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, as well as on the acts of violence carried out by the 
Israeli military circles, which killed and wounded dozens of our 
people's sons. 
  We believe that what will really facilitate the negotiations 
and any future meetings are effective measures taken by both the 
Israeli Government and Rabin in order to show real readiness for 
negotiations to achieve peace. Foremost among these measures is 
the disarming of the settlers and a clear announcement of 
commitment to implementing the agreement and its set dates. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee 
member, thank you very much. 
  [Ghawshah] You are welcome.

  [Text] Tunis, March 1 (AFP)--The PLO leadership decided 
late Monday [28 February] not to resume talks with Israel until 
it gets security guarantees for Palestinians, an authoritative 
source here said, amid reports of "hopeful signs" from the 
United Nations. 
  Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation's executive committee, emerged from the committee's 
second meeting here in two days to say that there would be no 
resumption of talks until there were guarantees of security and 
"international protection" for the Palestinians. 
  The decision casts doubt on the invitation by US President 
Bill Clinton to both sides to begin accelerated talks in 
Washington on Wednesday to speed up the peace process. Israel 
has accepted Clinton's initiative. 
  Monday's session, under the chairmanship of PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat, lasted two and a half hours, but was adjourned until 
later Tuesday to await the outcome of a United Nations Security 
Council debate on the massacre, Ghawshah said. 
  That debate, held over from Saturday amid sharp disagreement 
between the PLO and the United States, was due to have begun 
around 0100 GMT Tuesday (8:00 p.m. Monday in New York). 
  Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, 
said in New York that negotiations prior to the debate were 
"going well." 
  The current Security Council chairman, Roble Olhaye of 
Djibouti, said the delegations had "accomplished a lot" and that 
there were "hopeful signs for a resolution." 
  The PLO's representative at the United Nations, Nasir 
al-Qidwah, said he might well address the council, and that the 
Americans would not stand in his way, as they often did. 
  Talks in the Council snagged Saturday on Washington's 
opposition to PLO demands that the UN send an international 
peacekeeping force to the occupied territories, a move rejected 
by Israel. 
  PLO leaders have also slammed as "inadequate" Israeli 
pledges 
to disarm the most extreme of the Jewish settlers in the 
occupied territories, in the wake of Friday's massacre of 52 
Muslim worshippers in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  They want all settlers disarmed, an unreasonable demand in 
the eyes of the Israelis, who point to continuing attacks on 
settlers by Muslim extremists. 
  Israeli premier Yitzhaq Rabin announced in Jerusalem on 
Monday that Israel would accept the deployment of an 
international civilian force in the occupied territories. 
  "We would accept the stationing of an international presence 
in Gaza and Jericho, but it should not consist of military 
forces and should comply with the Oslo Declaration of 
Principles" on Palestinian self-rule signed last September, 
Rabin told representatives of American Jewish organisations. 
  But another PLO executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq told 
AFP after Monday's session that Rabin's offer was "derisory". 
  The PLO's mainstream Fatah movement announced Monday that it 
had ended the ceasefire it declared to celebrate the historic 
September 13 accord with Israel on limited Palestinian autonomy 
in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Shortly afterwards its Fatah Falcons guerrillas claimed 
responsibility for the murder of an 80-year-old Israeli who was 
hacked to death with an axe at Kfar Saba north of Tel Aviv. 
  Fatah supporters paraded in the Dayr Balah refugee camp in 
the Gaza Strip on Monday evening to claim the murder as an act 
of revenge. 
  Ghawshah also said the PLO leadership had resolved to 
increase its diplomatic activity to win worldwide backing for 
its demands, by making representations to the Arab nations, the 
non-aligned movement, the Russians, the Americans and the 
Europeans. 
  Three Arab delegations pulled out of talks with Israel in 
Washington on Sunday in protest at the massacre, after PLO 
leader Yasir 'Arafat criticised the Israeli army for failing to 
stop US-born doctor Barukh Goldstein emptying three and a half 
clips from his Galil automatic rifle into the worshippers. 
  And the Arab League council in Cairo on Sunday framed an 
uncompromising resolution blaming Israel for the attack.

the situation in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. 
  At the forefront of these topics is the issue of sending 
envoys to Washington to examine a number of matters, 
particularly the need to guarantee international protection for 
the Palestinian people, as well as the need to take effective 
measures to disarm the settlers, to remove a number of 
settlements which have been hotbeds of tension, and criminal 
activities against the Palestinian people. These are necessary 
prerequisites before the resumption of the peace process, which 
came into being in order to provide security for the Palestinian 
people and the rest of the region's peoples. However, such 
security has been violated by armed gangs of settlers. 
  Moreover, the measures which were taken yesterday by the 
Israeli Government do not constitute a practical step but merely 
an exercise to cover up the crime. For this reason, curbing the 
activities of settlers and the building of settlements in 
general, and the provision of international protection are 
fundamental requirements for the negotiations to take their 
natural course. 
  Conversely, we have also been trying to table these issues 
before the UN Security Council; we are hoping that a resolution, 
which would guarantee international protection and the 
disarmament of settlers, will be adopted in an effort by the 
international community to help us to continue the peace process 
to its final conclusion.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO </F>
Political Department, in Tunis, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in 
Cairo, from the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Qaddumi] Welcome. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Can you give us an idea about the 
Palestinian 
action following the dreadful massacre committed against the 
sons of the Palestinian people? 
  [Qaddumi] The horrendous crime committed by the Israelis in 
collusion with the army is a sign of disgrace in the history of 
these racist powers. We have taken measures to provide the 
necessary protection to our people by referring the issue to the 
UN Security Council, the highest international authority, to 
take the required steps to send international troops. We are 
pressing in the direction of the United States, because it can 
put pressure on Israel to disarm those settlers who tamper with 
peace and security and effect an early withdrawal. There are 
settlements that Rabin calls political settlements. Why don't 
they dismantle these settlements? Why are there no deterrent 
measures against the perpetrators? 
  Regrettably, the first responsibility falls on Rabin and the 
Israeli Government, which failed to take any measures to stop 
such acts in the past. We drew attention to these acts 
repeatedly; we warned Israel and the United States, as a sponsor 
of the peace conference. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You demand the disarming of settlers to 
guarantee the safety and security of the Palestinian citizen. 
Do you believe that this is sufficient, particularly as the 
army's collusion with the settlers has been established, as you 
said? 
  [Qaddumi] It is not sufficient. But to start with, we expect 
a swift withdrawal, as they promised. We expected it, as 
stipulated, on 13 December. Unfortunately, they failed to do 
that. I was certain in opposing that agreement that they would 
not withdraw. They were stalling for time to tell the world that 
security is unstable and that incidents would happen when they 
withdrew, leaving the security task to the Palestinians. By 
prolonging the period, the Israelis want to justify to the world 
the killing and terrorism they have exercised against our 
people. They killed national symbols. They have committed the 
biggest ever crime--the major holocaust [last word in English] 
at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  We will struggle. Our Arab brothers and our friends are 
standing by us against this dreadful crime. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You pointed out that settlements must be 
eliminated. They have become time bombs. You demanded that 
they be dismantled. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said 
that settlements will stay, that you agreed to this, and that 
they insist on that agreement. 
  [Qaddumi] First, we did not say we agree with maintaining 
the 
settlements. The political solution should be based on 
international legitimacy. Second, international legitimacy is 
represented by the UN Security Council resolutions. There is 
Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements. The 
United States approved that resolution. 
  Besides, the United States said the settlements constitute 
an obstacle to peace and Europe said they were illegal. Rabin 
is a liar and he prevaricates. He agreed with the army to carry 
out this filthy job. Had Rabin wanted peace, he would have 
withdrawn on 13 December. But, as Peres said, we have been 
talking or negotiating with ourselves in Cairo. The controversy 
has concerned the means to (?perpetuate) their presence. This is 
what they have been discussing. Why then do they arm the 
settlers? Isn't the Israeli army occupying our land? Yet they 
want to tell the world that they are not responsible for these 
crimes, which they plan in the dark. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question that arises concerning 
participation in the new round of bilateral peace talks between 
you and Israel, is there not? 
  [Qaddumi] On what do we negotiate now? What does Clinton 
want us to tell him at these negotiations? Why does he call the 
negotiators? First, decisive measures must be taken if the 
United States is eager for security and peace and not biased 
toward Israel. 
  By these quick negotiations, it seems that the United States 
wants to absorb international indignation. But international 
indignation is overwhelming and the United States cannot absorb 
it. Israel will indeed encounter numerous afflictions in the 
future because of its terrorist behavior. It has been proven to 
the world, particularly the countries that supported Israel, 
that Israel is the cause of tension in the region. It is the 
hotbed of tension. So, on what do we negotiate? Let Clinton 
tell Rabin frankly and clearly to withdraw from the Palestinian 
land. We have accepted peace and the U.S. conditions. Now they 
want us to negotiate following this tragedy. 
  The United States is asking the impossible. The Palestinian 
nation can stand fast and sacrifice. It will not surrender, no 
matter how big a power supports Israel. Yes, we know we are 
sacrificing and that this sacrifice is essential. If there is 
seriousness about establishing a just and durable peace, we 
support such a move. We said yes with pride to the peace 
conference under unjust conditions, which Baker, the architect 
of this settlement, knows. Why then does Clinton hesitate to 
take measures? We want you, the friends of Israel, if you are 
concerned about peace, to come forward and bridge this wide gap 
between us and Israel. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you very much. 
  [Qaddumi] We thank you very much and appreciate the role of 
our brothers in Egypt, who support the Palestinian people. We 
also appreciate the role of the Arab nation and the Arab League 
in this tragedy. No doubt, the united Arab stance is a basic 
factor and this unity has been clearly shown to the world.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to </F>
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and head of Palestinian delegation to 
negotiations with Israel, by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that the massacre of 
worshippers in al-Ibrahimi mosque "was not less serious than the 
Sarajevo massacre which put expressions of sadness on the lips 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton to the point of changing the 
course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Sha'th, who is the head of 
the 
Palestinian delegation to the Cairo negotiations with Israel on 
implementation of the interim autonomy agreement in Gaza and 
Jericho, criticized the U.S. reaction reflected in Clinton's 
call for the negotiations to be moved from Cairo to Washington. 
He asked: "After all that has happened, is the transfer of the 
negotiations the only reaction?" 
  Sha'th, who was today recalled to Tunis by Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat for consultation, also asked: "Was the 
massacre caused by the fact that the negotiations were not being 
held in Washington?" He said: "The causes were the collusion 
between the Israeli Army and the settlers, who are armed to the 
teeth..., the fact that the Israeli Government did not open fire 
on the settlers as they were killing dozens of Palestinian 
people..., the settlement policy, and the arming of the 
settlers." 
  On what was required of the United States, Sha'th said that 
"the United States, Israel, and the international community 
should disarm the settlers, reconsider the settlement policy, 
and provide international guarantees for the Palestinian 
people.... That is what is required and that is what the 
reaction should be." He pointed out that "all these guarantees 
could be provided through the very same Oslo agreement." 
  He asked: "What if the situation was reversed?... What if a 
Palestinian broke into a Jewish synagogue, opened fire on the 
worshippers, and killed 90 people and wounded 300 others?... 
What would have happened in the world if that took place?" 
  On the suspension of the Cairo negotiations, which were 
supposed to be resumed tomorrow, he said: "The question now is 
what do we negotiate about? We must first know what guarantees 
the world can offer us." He added: "Why summon the negotiators 
to Washington? In Cairo we were making progress and were about 
to finish our work." He continued: "What is required is not a 
move to Washington but work to avoid a repetition of what has 
happened, particularly as this massacre was not the first. 
There were many massacres before." Sha'th said: "The world 
should now immediately identify the real criminal, namely the 
settlement policy." 
  He drew attention to the fact that "the Israeli negotiators 
had wasted two-thirds of the negotiation time discussing 
protection for the settlers. What happened at al-Ibrahim mosque 
shows that the Palestinians are the ones who need protection." 
He stressed that the massacre demonstrated to the world "who is 
more in need of protection than the other." 
  On the PLO's moves and responsibilities after the al-Ibrahim 
mosque massacre in Hebron, he said: "The PLO's responsibility 
now is to protect our people in the occupied territory." He 
warned that if no protection guarantees are given to the 
Palestinians, the peace process would suffer "and the region 
would drown in a sea of blood as soon as any agreement is 
signed." 
  Asked if there were any conditions for the resumption of the 
negotiations in Cairo or Washington, he said: "Our duty now is 
to protect the people." He added: "Who is to guarantee us that 
this would not be repeated in al-Aqsa mosque where about 20,000 
worshippers perform the dawn prayer every day; particularly as 
it has happened before when settlers, in cooperation with 
soldiers, stormed al-Aqsa mosque and opened fire on the 
worshippers, which could easily be repeated in the absence of 
guarantees?" 
  Sha'th ridiculed the Israeli Government's claims that the 
perpetrator of the massacre was mentally ill. He said: "The 
theory about a deranged butcher is an irrational and immoral way 
of absolving Israel of the responsibility from beginning to end." 
  Asked if the massacre would become an item on the agenda of 
the negotiations, if resumed, so that guarantees could be 
requested, Sha'th emphasized that "the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
has guarantees.... The Israelis procrastinated on the grounds 
that the settlers were not a problem and the claim that Hamas 
was the problem..., but it has now been proven that the opposite 
is true." 
  Sha'th accused the Israeli Army of collusion with the 
settlers in this massacre. He stressed that "this criminal act 
was not an isolated personal act. It was committed in an 
atmosphere of collusion." He pointed out that "worshipers in 
al-Ibrahimi mosque pray with the guns of Israeli soldiers over 
their heads.... Where was that army?" He affirmed that "eight 
of the martyrs were killed by occupation soldiers' fire at the 
door of the mosque."

  [Text] London--Quds Press--Hani al-Hasan, member of the 
Fatah Central Committee, has said that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's call on the PLO and Israel to send delegations to 
Washington to resume the negotiations on implementing the 
provisions of the self-rule agreement are only aimed at 
containing the incident and ending its repercussions. 
  He added that the political leadership of the PLO must not 
accept a compromise stand from President Clinton's 
administration, noting that it must not respond to his call to 
go to Washington. 
  Al-Hasan said that the bloodbath that occurred in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque and the Juniyah massacre against Christian 
worshipers are both part of an Israeli plan to create chaos in 
the region on the road to establishing a new Israeli 
geopolitical situation. 
  Al-Hasan called for escalating confrontations against the 
Israeli enemy until the army begins to withdraw from our 
territories--occupied since 1967--under UN supervision. He 
noted that the escalation of confrontations and the shedding of 
the heroic martyrs' blood will only be considered a turning 
point if the current negotiations are immediately halted and the 
Declaration of Principles signed in Oslo is terminated. There 
can be no negotiations except those based on a comprehensive 
solution and an immediate Israeli withdrawal from our beloved 
homeland. 
  Al-Hasan urged the Egyptian Government to take measures, to 
at least immediately withdraw its Egyptian ambassador from Tel 
Aviv and to expel the Israeli ambassador from Cairo. 
  He called on the Palestinian political forces to meet in 
order to draw the bases for a national unity aimed at escalating 
the struggle and confrontation against the Israeli enemy. 
  Al-Hasan said: Fatah cadres inside and outside the occupied 
territories should close their ranks and return to our 
revolutionary and sound course. 
  He said that these are historic days in which the failing 
ones will be severely punished. He added: As of today, there 
will be no place for political committees. Glory to the great 
intifadah.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Palestinian Opposition Factions </F>
Pledge Vengeance"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- The 10 Palestinian factions opposed 
to the Oslo agreement have threatened to escalate military 
action and retaliate to the "al-Ibrahimi mosque crime in 
Hebron." They called on the PLO to "revoke the Gaza-Jericho and 
the Cairo document" signed with Israel and to request the 
dismantling of the settlements in the occupied territory. 
  Abu-'Ali Mustafa, deputy secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] (led by George 
Habash), has told AL-HAYAH that "today's (yesterday's) crime was 
premeditated. Nobody should believe that the Israeli officials 
were not linked to the operation, for they want to combine the 
PLO leadership's political submission with military submission 
through massacres." 
  He said that yesterday's PLO call yesterday for the 
dismantling of the settlements "came too late and its aim was to 
contain the people's fury." He urged the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] (led by Nayif Hawatimah) and 
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) to overlook their 
differences. 
  Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative in Damascus, 
dismissed the claim that the perpetrator of the massacre was 
mentally deranged. He emphasized that Hamas "pledges 
retaliation for the crime." He told AL-HAYAH that the massacre 
"will not affect the implmentation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement." He accused the Israeli forces of complicity. He 
said that the "operation was planned by the army and the 
settlers. No armed person can enter the mosque without 
coordination with the army and no single person can kill about 
50 people and wound over 200." He added that "the only language 
those (Israelis) understand is the language of military action." 
  Hamas' information office yesterday issued a statement 
calling for an urgent enlarged meeting of the Islamic movements 
in the Arab and Islamic states "to consider ways of reacting to 
the Zionist massacre and of supporting the Palestinian people." 
The statement added: "Let the confrontations escalate and let 
the land erupt in flames and earthquakes under the feet of the 
occupation. Let (Yitzhaq) Rabin know that our people's flesh is 
very bitter." 
  Hamas later issued another statement calling on the 
Palestinian and Arab negotiators to withdraw from the 
negotiations with Israel. It added: "We call on the Tunis 
leadership to return to the option of resistance as the only 
strategic option for our people to regain their rights and 
avenge the blood of the martyrs." 
  Hawatimah said that escalation of military action and the 
downfall of the Oslo and Cairo agreements "would open the way 
for a political settlement based on withdrawal, termination of 
[Israeli] settlement and massacres, and fulfillment of our 
people's right to self-determination and independence." He 
called for a three-day general strike in the West Bank, 
Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip." 
  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front Secretary General Khalid 
'Abd-al-Majid has urged the Security Council to "take the 
necessary measures to prevent the Zionists from committing their 
crimes." He called on Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to 
stop the negotiations with Israel. 
  The PFLP and the DFLP have issued a statement requesting 
international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territory and promising to "avenge" the Hebron massacre and 
"punish the occupation forces and the settlers." The statement 
called on the Palestinian president to stop the negotiations 
with the Hebrew state. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Damascus, 28 Feb (SANA)--The unified central command 
of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has 
said that the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque and the 
ensuing bloody repression is the bitter fruit of the Oslo 
agreement. The command stressed that this agreement must be 
foiled and that the political process must be rebuilt based on 
the resolutions of international legitimacy that deal with the 
Palestinian cause in order to reach a solution that secures the 
Palestinian Arab people's national rights to repatriation and 
self-determination and their right to establishing an 
independent state. 
  In a statement issued following its extraordinary session 
today, the command called for a halt to the current negotiations 
within the framework of the Oslo agreement until the Security 
Council resolutions that call for an end to settlement building, 
which they consider illegitimate, are implemented; until the 
Fourth Geneva Convention is applied in the occupied territories, 
including Jerusalem; and until protection for the Palestinian 
Arab people is secured. 
  The command demanded that the Security Council adopt clear 
resolutions and a suitable mechanism to implement its 
resolutions on settlement building. 
  In another development, the DFLP called on Arab League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to directly intervene 
with the U.S. Administration, Russia, and Europe in order to 
take tangible steps in response to the bloody massacres against 
the Palestinian Arab people, especially the crime at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque--steps that similar to those taken in Bosnia. 
  In a message today, the DFLP called on Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to 
adopt appropriate resolutions, especially in terms of tightening 
the economic boycott of Israel to its maximum levels until a 
comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian cause and the 
Arab-Israeli conflict is reached. Such a settlement should be 
based on the principle of full withdrawal for full peace, on 
providing international protection for Palestinian people under 
the occupation by deploying international forces under UN 
supervision, an on rebuilding the bases of the negotiating 
process on the Palestinian-Israeli track in accordance with the 
bases of the Arab-Israeli negotiations between Jordan, Syria, 
and Lebanon on one hand and Israel on the other.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Alliance of Palestinian Forces in </F>
Jordan in Amman on 27 February] 
  [Text] Masses of our Palestinian people, and of the Arab 
and Islamic nation, the mosque martyrs and all the bereaved 
Palestinians curse 'Arafat and his traitorous gang, wash their 
hands from them, and appeal to the nation, its youth, men, 
women, and children to rise up to bury the treason and the 
traitors, and from the positions they occupy, to protect the 
relatives, pursue the revolution, escalate the heroic intifadah, 
mete double retaliation against the enemy, and terminate its 
crimes against our relatives and nation. The revolution is our 
guarantor and the struggle is the means with which to protect 
our people and regain our rights. 
  The mosque massacre and all the enemy's massacres, 
practises, 
and policies explicitly prove it is impossible to coexist with 
this enemy, and that our people's only option is that of the 
revolution and struggle to defend our existence and rights. 
These crimes exposed for the umpteenth time the wretchedness 
and futility of the settlement course, and the suspect peace 
calls. More than this, these crimes offer new evidence as to 
the catastrophic dangers posed by this course and these venomous 
calls not only to the security of the nation and the people but 
to the personal safety of the defenseless citizen who is 
prostrated in prayer in God's places of worship. 
  Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, in wake of all this, 
will the supporters of the negotiations and of what is falsely 
termed peace repent, or do they relish telling lies, forging the 
people's will, conceding rights, reneging the martyrs, tampering 
with the nation's destiny under claims of rationalism and waging 
a struggle on the negotiations table, and competing to submit to 
the enemy under the excuse that there is no other alternative? 
Faced with the enemy's massacres and its plan to destroy us, 
can there be any other option than self-defense? Has treason 
and the course of capitulation protected anyone, even those who 
are performing prayers in God's places of worship? 
  We call on the nation's masses and the Palestinian people to 
cling to the intifadah and armed struggle option, and to 
escalate, protect, and support the intifadah in a manner that 
would topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and its symbols, led by 
traitor 'Arafat. 
  Glory and immortality to the righteous martyrs of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, and of our intifadah and revolution. Greetings 
to our people's heroic intifadah. Shame on the traitors and 
agents. We pledge to pursue the struggle until the attainment 
of all the our people's objectives of liberation and 
repatriation. Victory for the revolution and immortality for 
our martyrs. 
  The odious bloody massacre by rancorous Zionist gangs devoid 
of human feeling, and thirsty for killing and destroying all 
that is Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim is a crime against our 
defenseless people and the groups of worshipers in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque at dawn on 25 February 1994. It testfies once again to 
the racist and sanguinary nature of this entity, and clearly 
exposes its persistence to carry out the policy of killing, 
persecuting, and destroying all that is Arab, Palestinian, and 
Muslim. At the same time, this reprehensible crime highlights 
the meaning, nature, and upshot of the Zionist-U.S. peace and 
the role of the Oslo conspiracy and the treasonous Gaza-Jericho 
agreement and its subsequent chapters. 
  Masses of our Arab and Islamic nation, Yes, this is the 
accurate interpretation of the Zionist-U.S. peace. It consists 
of daily massacres, of persecution and starvation, and of 
destruction and eviction. While criminal Zionist Rabin and his 
traitor partner 'Arafat sign with one hand the documents and 
chapters of the conspiracy in Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, they 
hurl with the other hand bombs and open fire on the defenseless 
sons of our people in mosques, streets, and houses, emphasizing 
that the peace that is sought is one of surrendering to the 
Zionist butcher's knife, and defining the form of the peace they 
want with the blood of our people and sons. 
  While the Zionists pursue their massacres against the 
innocent and the defenseless, the traitors persist with their 
betrayal of the people, the cause, and the martyrs, and continue 
to submit to the enemy, thus confirming to it that its methods 
are successful and encouraging it to pursue the policy of 
destroying our people. They did not learn lessons from their 
agreement with Philip Habib, when they opted for their safety 
and left our people in Beirut as prey for the Zionist and 
islolationist gangs, under Sharon. Our people at the time were 
massacred in Sabra and Shatila. They also did not learn lessons 
from Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, and al-Dawayimah, and from all the 
massacres the Zionist gangs committed to expel our people and 
force them to become refugees. They never learned the lesson 
and led our people from one massacre to the other under the 
mirage of settlements, lies, treason, and the falsification of 
facts as they had forged the people's will. Now, they 
impudently claim that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron 
seeks to foil the so-called Gaza-Jericho agreement, although 
Rabin and Peres have been announcing that they were negotiating 
with themselves and that they got all that they wanted. This 
means that the traitors threaten our people with more massacres 
if they do not condone their treason.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. President Is Ignoring the Depth of </F>
Our Wound"] 
  [Text] The tragedy that befell us after the settlers, 
through the hands of the criminal doctor Barukh Goldstein, 
slaughtered more than 60 of our people's sons at prayer Friday 
morning at the Ibrahimi Mosque continues to weigh on the 
conscience of each of us. The criminal's timing coincided with 
Muslim prayer ceremonies. This increases the anger and the 
feeling of bitterness and pain. Despite this, President Clinton 
has called on us to exercise restraint. This means that we 
should bow our heads and accept these shameful crimes. 
  Despite our people's ordeal, U.S. President Clinton 
announced 
that he was inviting Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to come to Washington to 
complete the talks on the agreements. He did this while our 
blood, which flowed at the Ibrahimi Mosque, was still warm. He 
does not realize the extent of the hatred this sort of massacre 
causes. We would have liked President Clinton to say that he 
opposes the settlers' impudence; that Israel, if it desires the 
establishment of a just peace, should put an end to settlement 
activity and the settlers' practices; and that he condemns their 
attempts to wreck the chance for peace. Does President Clinton 
wish to continue the policy of his predecessor, President Bush, 
in humiliating our nation and imposing hegemony over its future? 
  We ask President Clinton: What would have been Israel's and 
the United States' position if it were the Palestinians who 
perpetrated such gross violence against the Israelis? We recall 
that when some Palestinians tried to carry out an operation on 
the shores of Tel Aviv during President Bush's term, there was a 
worldwide uproar and the President adopted the unfair decision 
to suspend the dialogue with the PLO, which was followed by 
other measures. Our people have always been against violence 
aimed at innocent persons, regardless of its source. We reject 
the fact that President Clinton spoke in such a manner and 
blamed only the criminal who perpetrated this barbaric act. The 
massacre has deeper dimensions. In Qiryat Arba', the settlement 
built on the outskirts of Hebron, hatred and violence against 
Palestinians is fomented. What the criminal Goldstein did was 
no more than a translation of what those malicious people harbor 
in their minds. If it is not possible to evacuate them from 
Palestinian lands, they must at least be punished by preventing 
them from entering Hebron, especially the Ibrahimi Mosque, which 
they have defiled by their act. 
  We are addressing President Clinton not only because he 
sponsors the peace process and oversees the Palestinian-Israeli 
accord, but because the criminal came from the United States. 
He is of U.S. origin. Many of the settlers who have committed 
crimes against our people came from the United States. They are 
fanatic adherents of extremism and racism who cover their crimes 
with Israeli garb. 
  As for the Palestinian-Israeli talks and the sincere 
Palestinian aspiration for a just peace and a settlement based 
on international legitimacy, this has been met by the United 
States or Israel by obvious foot-dragging and a policy based on 
maneuvering and on gambling on the Arabs' current situation. 
President Clinton must realize that it is folly to bet on this 
state continuing. Our nation's despair, its sense of 
humiliation, and the scorn with which our causes are addressed 
can lead to explosions that will be difficult to control. What 
is taking place today on the land of Palestine will put matters 
back at square one. 
  Needless to say, it will be difficult to discuss President 
Clinton's invitation to resume the talks in Washington on the 
presidential level unless the issue of the settlements and the 
settlers is addressed. The failure of the Israeli settlement 
policy on Palestinian lands has been proven. Israel must 
address this issue and defuse the situation before it blows up. 
U.S. invitations are tantamount to entertaining futile hopes, 
devoid of reality. All peace initiatives and efforts and 
peaceful invitations will be of no benefit unless they are 
accompanied by urgent action to end the violence and extremism 
practiced by the settlers against our people.

  [Text] Dear brothers: What is the meaning of Clinton's 
call for a resumption of the negotiations in Washington? Will 
Washington bring us back the blood that has been shed? Or will 
it, for that matter, protect us from Zionist crimes? 
  The United States is inviting us to Washington, contending 
that peace will resolve all problems. Hence, it wants the 
negotiators to sign an agreement there. It wants it to be said, 
in a familiar media stunt, that an agreement has been reached, 
that the United States is capable of resolving all problems, and 
that both sides have been granted justice. The Palestinian 
negotiators will have something to say on the occasion. They 
will say the following: We have asked for U.S. intervention, 
and we have obtained this intervention. We have signed the 
agreement and that ends everything, thus the blood shed in 
Hebron has not gone to waste. Much of this unconvincing talk 
will be heard. 
  Attention will then be focused on how to find new answers to 
justify the next massacre. This is the way things are being 
handled and managed. How can the Palestinians accept this 
thoroughly rotten and objectionable situation? How can the free 
Palestinians accept all this misrepresentation of facts, all 
this humiliation, and all this gratuitous death?

  [Text] Brothers: The massacre at the Ibrahimi shrine 
yesterday, which was plotted by the Israeli Government against 
our people, should not be seen in isolation from past 
developments. 
  This massacre falls within the framework and development of 
the settlement policy. Most important, it took place as a 
result of the decision of the Israeli Government and army to 
give the green light to the settlers to persecute our 
defenseless people. 
  Anyone who reminds himself of past events will be able to 
recall ugly scenes similar to the one that took place yesterday 
in full view of the world. Thus, it is wrong to wonder if the 
Israeli Government is responsible for the terrible massacre 
yesterday. The Israeli Government is not only responsible for 
the massacre, it was involved in it, proven by the pictures that 
have been beamed by international media organs, pictures that 
remind people of despicable Nazism. These are pictures of the 
Israeli Army protecting the settlers who, in civilian clothes, 
were hitting Palestinians with sticks, kicking them, opening 
fire on them, and attacking their vehicles. 
  Thus, it is important to view the massacre as an official 
Israeli massacre for it was conducted on the one hand under the 
protection of the Israeli Army and police, which do not leave 
the Ibrahimi shrine unprotected [as heard]; on the other hand, 
it was a natural development of the policy of using the settlers 
as a means of terrorism and spreading fear among Palestinians as 
well as to intimidate them. The settlers were thereby able to 
do what the Israeli officials could not do publicly. 
  Furthermore, the martyrs who fell at the Ibrahimi shrine 
were 
not the only victims of yesterday, a black day in the holy month 
of Ramadan. What about those who were killed or injured in 
front of hospitals and those who fell during the confrontation 
between the Israeli Army and police and those who went out to 
express their outrage? The Israeli Army and police killed them 
deliberately and clearly in front of the cameras. 
  Thus, the problem of settlement should become the most 
important topic on the agenda of the talks as no negotiations 
will proceed in the right diretion without first resolving such 
a problem. No progress or development in negotiations will take 
place as long as such a problem is not resolved in a way that 
will prevent the Israeli Government from using the settlements 
to carry out more massacres for political aims. 
  Some people believed, however, that disarming the settlers 
would be enough; such a view would not resolve the core of the 
problem because settlements were set up as military projects 
with a number of functions: to intervene by using terror and 
repression. Therefore, disarming them cannot be guaranteed by 
anyone, and we cannot be assured that yesterday's atrocity will 
not be repeated. 
  Therefore, the removal of all settlements is the most 
correct 
and the most urgent matter, particularly given the fact that 
negotiations will be taking place later about the future of the 
settlements. However, in negotiations there are usually 
problems and developments that will make their progress 
dependent on whether there is a need to continue with the 
negotiations themselves or not. [sentence as heard] 
  Nevetheless, if removing the settlements is hard to achieve, 
then an agreement should at least be reached on the protection 
of our people--by an international force sent by the United 
Nations to protect our people from these wanton, terrible, and 
racist aggressions that have been carried out by the settlers 
with the Rabin government's protection and participation--until 
talks about the future of the settlement are held in accordance 
with the timetable agreed upon between the PLO and the Israelis. 
  This could be a price that our people might accept, given 
the 
amount of killing, savagery, racism, and religious fanaticism, 
which is focused on the annihilation of the Palestinian people 
by killing them while they were praying their god. 
  A fanatic Israeli organization announced responsibility for 
the massacre shortly after it was committed. This means that 
the massacre was also plotted by the settlers and not the 
government alone. This should lead us to a very interesting 
question about the nature of Israel and how we should deal with 
the Israeli Government: Should we deal with it as a state or 
merely as a party, a faction, or an organization for as long as 
the settlers hold tens of thousands of weapons which can be used 
at any time for public and premeditated killing, by an 
individual or by a group, of our defenseless Palestinian people.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech by King Husayn at Ramadan fast-breaking </F>
banquet for the members of the House of Representatives and the 
religious judges of the East and West Bank in Amman on 26 
February -- recording] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Good evening, and many happy returns. Now that the House of 
Representatives has begun to exercise its responsibilities; and 
as your brother, who has had the honor of serving with the sons 
of this country for more than 40 years, I found that I have to 
meet my brothers to talk about some of our concerns and affairs. 
We want to talk in a fraternal way within this family to which 
we all belong out of our concern to carry out our duties in a 
satisfactory way. I hope that we all seek God's satisfaction 
and ask Him to guide us and grant us success. 
  When we prepared for this meeting in this blessed month and 
on this night, we did not imagine that it would take place in 
the wake of one of the ugliest crimes witnessed by the world. 
This crime was perpetrated yesterday morning in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque when a large number of our kinsfolk, brothers, 
and beloved ones were martyred and others more were wounded. 
Those who died on Friday morning in the Ibrahimi Mosque in this 
blessed month will go to heaven with the chaste righteous 
martyrs. Everyone hopes he will become a martyr for the sake of 
God. Only God knows when a person will die. 
  We were, still are, and will continue to support our 
kinsfolk 
and brothers in Hebron, Jerusalem, and in every part of the 
occupied Arab territory. I cannot express in words the 
endurance of the kinsfolk there under occupation. They are an 
example for people in terms of their patience, steadfastness, 
and adherence to their land and rights. I also reiterate that 
we will continue to do the impossible to have them regain all 
their rights on their national soil. We have no other objective 
or goal other than a clear conscience and the satisfaction of 
Almighty God. 
  We have done all we can in the face of this tragedy in 
terms of what we can offer and our available capabilities. 
  We sympathize with every mother and father who lost a 
martyr, 
with every brother who lost his brother, with every human being 
in Hebron, with those injured, and with our kinsfolk. 
  Once again I say--and this is not the first time, though one 
always hopes it is the last--that we do not have any objective 
and we do not harbor ambitions other than to see the kinsfolk 
masters of their land. 
  Faced with what has happened, we are going to do our best to 
push the responsible quarters in Israel to expose their real 
faces. Will they shoulder their responsibilities toward what 
happened and take measures that would at least show that all 
efforts made toward peace were or were not right? 
  The story did not begin with this massacre and heinous 
crime. 
Before this crime there was the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque, 
the aggression against the sacred shrines, including the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, and the aggression against the Christian holy 
places. You remember that we have been calling for religious 
jurisdiction, and that sovereignty on all sacred places is for 
Almighty God. As for the Islamic holy places, we try to gather 
around us the support of all brothers in the Islamic world to 
guarantee that what happened will not recur in the future. What 
has taken place is enough to prove that these people do not 
shoulder their responsibilities and cannot be asked to assume 
responsibility for the holy places of those who believe in God. 
  The issue then requires that we think about a new 
satisfactory situation in which the Islamic world will shoulder, 
with us, its responsibilities. There were talks about 
interfaith dialogue with regard to the holy places. Sovereignty 
is for Almighty God. Each side will then take care of its holy 
places regardless of the political situation or the possible and 
impossible solutions. We will continue to call for all this and 
work toward materializing this call on the ground. We hope the 
time will come when believers in God will compete for 
worshipping, fearing, and respecting God in the holy places. 
  With regard to the measures that should be taken at this 
stage, we think and work, in addition to all that you were 
acquainted with, to adopt a stand that will have positive 
effects. Before and after everything, we think of our kinsfolk, 
brothers, and beloved ones. 
  I heard some people saying that we should withdraw from the 
negotiations and others saying that we have no right to discuss 
such matters under these circumstances. (?This is) correct. I 
am talking to you as a person in whom, I believe, you have 
confidence, and through you I am addressing the entire Jordanian 
community. I am talking to you as a person who has confidence 
and who also trusts you all. I hope that all my brothers will 
give us the opportunity as well as the support through 
awareness, honesty, sincerity, and determination to work to 
enable us to remain steadfast in the face of the continuous and 
difficult pressures coming from all directions. 
  My wish is for us to enjoy a measure of awareness, and to 
have the resolve and determination to always take manly stands, 
as we did in the past, to demonstrate that we are unwilling to 
bow to anybody other than Almighty God. We could face 
difficulties and pressures. This has been our story from the 
outset. I would like to see all psychologically prepared when 
such an eventuality materializes. This is important if 
everybody is to extend his share of support, and if we, along 
with you, God willing, are to stand with our heads held high, 
and if the outcome is to be to our liking. 
  In their conduct toward us, some in this world always have 
in 
mind the Israeli public opinion, the public opinion here or 
there, as if we do not have a public opinion. We would like to 
tell them that we do have a public opinion, that we have a 
lively and enlightened people, and that we have the resolve and 
ability to hold out, stand fast, move forward, and shoulder 
responsibilities jointly and unequivocally with regard to all 
issues and topics. We have the ability to control our emotions 
by exercising our mental faculties. We are able to chart the 
outlines of our future policies, and to walk our path in 
complete unison, demonstrating joint understanding and 
cooperation. We might differ on some interpretations or views. 
However, when joint interests, which are of greater importance 
than all issues, are at stake, we remain cohesive under all 
circumstances and conditions. Nonetheless, and to be frank, I 
will not hesitate to take a certain step in response to the 
public opinion if such a step is found to be appropriate. I 
believe that I am aware of the sentiments of the good people 
from whom I emerged and to whom I belong. All that I ask of you 
is for you to be with your homeland and with this march, always 
and ever. 
  I will be frank with you, and tell you about all that needs 
to be communicated outside the confines of official agencies. 
  Of course you, in the House of Representatives, have the 
right to acquaint yourselves with everything and to participate 
in drawing up the path for the present and future. The issue of 
withdrawing or not withdrawing is something we decide on the 
basis of our convictions, and also within the framework of 
cooperation and coordination with our brothers in the Arab world. 
  If we continue, there will be a price and a benefit which we 
hope will be for our kinsfolk and brothers in the occupied 
territories in the first place. If we withdraw for 
consultation, or if we withdraw for good, this should be in the 
interest of our cause and our generations both at present and in 
the future. But to be absorbed in details and to spread this 
talk beyond the House of Representatives, I think will not serve 
our interest at this stage. 
  As for the House and its performance so far, and the 
impression I received when this House was elected--which is the 
second parliament since our resumption of democratic life in 
this country--and through long experience, in fact my feeling is 
that through your election the citizens and voters reflected the 
ambitions, hopes, and awareness they have. The citizen wants 
you to work, to work more, and to give the maximum you can in a 
reasonable, enlightened, and honest manner. 
  My hope has been, is still, and will continue to be that you 
will continue and try to make up for the past. Much time passed 
in terms of achievements that could have been made, in terms of 
the stage and how delicate and difficult it is, in terms of laws 
that need rectification and adoption, in terms of work, and in 
terms of issues that need to be presented and discussed. 
  I urged the government, urged the House -- represented by 
its speaker and the brothers when I met them -- and urged the 
brothers in the Senate to maintain coordination so that matters 
will be tackled efficiently and with responsibility. 
Ultimately, people will judge us in light of our achievements. 
  As a brother, rather than from the position of a person with 
responsibilities, I would like to appeal to you all to rise 
above minor issues and personal conflicts. I also appeal to you 
not to waste time on issues that would tarnish your image, our 
image, Jordan's image, or the march. 
  Let us stand well with each other and let us work in the 
interest of the country. Each one of us, particularly you, 
should work toward laying the foundations for new parliamentary 
traditions and norms so that the bases will be stronger than 
before and so that the coming generations will continue to walk 
on a clear path. Even practically, I do not believe that the 
situation is sound. In every House session, the whole cabinet 
should be present. If the cabinet spends two days with the 
House and one day with the Senate, and if it holds its meetings 
in two days, how many days will be left for the cabinet to 
tackle the citizens' issues? I believe that if the concerned 
ministers attend the House session this will be sufficient. Of 
course, in important issues the entire cabinet must be there. 
  Through dialogue, you can discuss the situation so that you 
can invest our potentials, resources, and time in a better way. 
The official media are not carrying out their role. We want 
our brothers to move in this regard. The media are considered 
state media, but they are lost and absent in most cases. Either 
the media should be a state media that advocate the state policy 
or we should find another formula. 
  I will not specify, but there are laws that are of great 
importance. Once again, when these laws are presented to you 
they are presented because there is a conviction that they are 
feasible and beneficial to the citizen and needy citizen, and 
they are presented to organize this country and the relations of 
its people, and so that its resources are not wasted or 
exhausted. These laws would be beneficial for our people, 
family, and march regardless of whether they were proposed by 
this or that world quarter . 
  There are other issues that you will discuss and on which 
you 
will make the appropriate decision. I believe we should not be 
too hasty in some fields so that we will not suffer a setback. 
Do we follow the right measures when we plan for the future in 
Amman or elsewhere? Do we start with the ideal thing that 
should be realized one day and make sure not to make mistakes to 
avoid negative results, God forbid? 
  I had in mind, and I proposed to my brothers that there 
should be coordination, contacts, explanation, and discussion 
concerning any draft law and all stages through which it passes 
so that the outcome and result will be the ideal that we and 
everyone of us seeks in this country. I believe that so far 
this mechanism is not available in a satisfactory and 
comfortable manner. I pray for Almighty God's help so that this 
will be the natural situation in the future. 
  What is painful to me more than anything else is to use my 
right and return some laws, as happened several times, out of my 
concern for the homeland and the people. I do not want to 
exercise this right so spare me, yourselves, the Senate, all 
brothers, and the homeland this effort through cooperation 
between the executive and legislative branches of power, and 
through studying everything with due attention until eventually 
the desired situation is reached. 
  I do not believe that any of us is outbidding others, or 
likes to be called a person engaged in oneupmanship. The 
country is ours, and what is at stake is the destiny of future 
generations. Hence, God willing, each of us will be engaged day 
and night in some sort of soul-searching. Each of us must do 
all he can to achieve our objectives and goals. 
  The circumstances are tough, and the suffering is 
continuing. 
Pressures on us continue from all directions. However, we must 
confront them with discipline, patience, resolve, and 
determination. Even our reactions to what we are experiencing, 
and to our past experiences must be studied and calculated to 
yield a positive outcome. People can express their feelings in 
lots of ways. However, we must underscore the positive aspect in 
this. 
  A question is posed on whether a strike, for example, with 
due respect to the views of brothers in this regard, would 
promote, even in the least, the cause of our kinfolk and 
brothers in the occupied territories, and in Hebron in 
particular at present. If, God forbid, we inflame people's 
sentiments and a guest of ours, regardless of where he came from 
on this globe, is encroached on, would such a thing bring us 
honor, given that these people are our guests? Should we 
degrade ourselves, God forbid, to the level reached by the 
enemies, who are behaving unreasonably and unacceptably, when 
nothing escapes the attention of the world community, or should 
we think of alternatives? Why should we bring life in Amman, 
other cities, or villages to a standstill for a single day? 
This would prevent people from selling their goods, or leading 
a normal life. If we were to set aside part of that day's 
earnings and donate it humbly to our brethren, would this not be 
a better move? 
  It would be preferable, brothers, if each of us thinks day 
and night of all he can do to ensure the availability of 
resources that could promote the interests of both the homeland 
and the march. 
  We have been living under difficult circumstances over the 
past four years. Instead of switching on all lights, we could 
switch on some of them; and instead driving too many cars, we 
could share a car with a brother or friend. The objective is to 
save some energy. If we save a few things here and there, we 
could have something that would help us face any possibility. 
  One of the issues that was discussed for a long time was the 
issue of medical care, food, medicine. We have been looking 
into this subject over the past years. What happens in others 
parts of the world could also happen here. Consequently, we 
should issue instructions and attempt to unify and organize 
departments to enable them deal with this situation. 
  It is known that some industrial countries are not concerned 
about exporting goods that are below the standards used in the 
industrial countries themselves. This needs our concern and 
control. We are not the first, nor will we be the last country 
to make mistakes. If these mistakes are detected and rectified, 
and if the responsible side is the party which discovered this 
situation and adopted a stand -- as happened here -- then this 
is good. However, let us look at the broader picture. How many 
people know that according to international reports we have no 
less than 7,000 drug addicts? We remain silent on these matters 
either out of shame or because we are incapable of dealing with 
it. We must begin to tackle this problem correctly whether 
through firm measures regarding trafficking or traffickers or 
through setting up specialized centers to treat and cure addicts. 
  But to remain shy and silent, I believe this is a mistake 
we commit against ourselves and our children--many of whom went 
abroad for study and returned with these or other problems. 
  We are in need of industry, development, and everything. 
There is a subject I have repeatedly raised with our brothers, 
including the deputies from the al-Fuhays area, and they are 
trying. Do you not see the billowing smoke which contains 
cement dust. [reference here is to the cement factories in 
al-Fuhays] 
  My granddaughter and all my sons from 'Abdallah to this 
little Jumanah, suffer from asthma. For years, we have been 
saying that someone should study this situation. There are 
human beings around this site. This does not mean that I am 
pushing you to decide something now, but it is time to think 
about our people. May be because I am concerned and I 
personally suffered, otherwise my voice would have been lower 
than the others, but this is something illogical. 
  Our water and treatment of it, and ensuring that poisons 
from 
the factories do not reach the dams and contaminate the water 
there. Should I or you be the one to raise these issues? Should 
I or you be the one to tackle it in a calm and objective 
discussion? Likewise, there are many other issues that I think 
we have to handle? But to concentrate on trivial things is not 
good for any of my brothers or for the homeland. Wasting 
time--and it seems lately we have been wasting much time, God 
help us--should stop. If you have another opinion, then we 
should seek the judgment of the people. God willing, they will 
be the judge of whether we are doing what we should in the best 
possible manner. 
  Our country is good and generous. It is a rock in the face 
of enemies. Our country is full of good things. What pains me 
most is to see continuous attempts to harm and undermine all its 
achievements. 
  Nobody mentions good accomplishments. However, we rummage 
around for things to brand as mistakes. If what is found to be 
a mistake is really significant, that would be most welcome. 
Nonetheless, it seems that we are headed for frustration to 
frustrate both ourselves and people. Why is this? This must 
not be the case. 
  Let is recall the starting point, when we chose to revive 
democratic and parliamentary traditions and when circumstances 
made this revival possible. I would like to say that our 
decision in this regard was not the outcome of popular pressure 
from any party whatsoever. Rather, this revival of democratic 
and parliamentary traditions was the outcome of a decision we 
made and a wish we had. We want democracy to be a trust to 
bequeath to our future generations so they may carry, safeguard, 
and protect it. We wanted this country to be an example and 
model to others. 
  Many people are making allegations in this regard. This must 
not be the case. We should not remain silent over this. In the 
past, similar allegations were made. The late Abu-'Adnan 
[Bahjat] al-Talhuni [former Senate member] was with me at this 
Court when the Army Command was Arabized. Then, we were 
approached only after the people had realized that the 
accomplishment had been made, and that those whose departure was 
ordered had already left the country. However, afterward, we 
heard of heroes who drew up schemes and carried out certain 
feats in this regard. Abu-Shakir [Royal Court Chief al-Sharif 
Zayd Bin-Shakir] is aware of this. Nobody approached us then. 
There have been numerous recurrences of this. 
  We embrace democracy within our hearts and souls. We want it 
to succeed. We want to set an example and a model of shura to 
others. We want Arab individuals to live and realize that they 
are of value, that they are human beings, just like other human 
beings. We want this march to achieve its purposes and 
objectives. We are bound to succeed. So, help us all so we may 
succeed. In other words, let us all cooperate to render the 
march a success. 
  As for the issues pertaining to inter-Arab meetings, 
inter-Arab cooperation, and the demands for holding an Arab 
summit, I would like to say that we have always been at the 
forefront of those demanding such a summit, and we will continue 
to be so. 
  I have never considered any difference with any brother 
here or in any other place a personal matter that will leave any 
trace. We might have differences of interpretation sometimes. 
I never took the insults which even reached plotting to kill as 
personal. Even the insults, vilifications, and digging up the 
past I never took as personal. This is because a man in this 
position and with such responsibilities must be above all these 
things. I sincerely and honestly mean what I am saying. This 
is our situation, our life, and our path. We must not continue 
to speak about the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army. I 
reiterate what many people have reiterated: Had it not been for 
the Intelligence, the Security, and the Army we would not have 
the opportunity to live such a life. The Intelligence is not 
against the citizens of this country; it is to protect the 
country against deep-rooted and strong organizations that have 
huge potentials in the most serious positions in the Arab 
homeland. We as well as the Army -- our officers and soldiers 
who are protecting long fronts against dangers and challenges to 
maintain the security of the country and who are deployed 
throughout the world -- praise be to God, are appreciated and 
respected by people. Instead of deploying foreign forces here 
and there in our Arab territory, we are assuming this role to 
prevent evil among people in Europe and elsewhere with a high 
degree of efficiency, capability, and honesty. 
  Our youths are in Yemen now in an attempt to consolidate the 
pillars of the accord on which all the sons of Yemen were 
unanimous. We had the honor to welcome them here in Amman, Amman 
of the Arabs, the capital of accord and reconciliation. Our 
youths from the Armed Forces are there in Yemen to help 
implement the accord and pledge document and to tackle a matter 
inflicted on our kinsfolk and brothers. Our duty as Arabs is to 
resolve our problems and to support each other under difficult 
circumstances and in the face of challenges. 
  People, this homeland deserves more. May God grant us 
success and guide us on the right path. I have great hope in 
you. Almighty God will guide our march and grant us success. 
Greetings to you all. God's peace. mercy, and blessings be 
upon you.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the talks with 
the Palestinians will resume in Washington on 2 March upon the 
invitation of President Clinton. Israel accepted the 
President's invitation, but it is still not clear whether the 
Palestinians also accepted. The prime minister made these 
remarks to 70 ambassadors posted in Israel whom he summoned to 
his office in Tel Aviv in order to brief them about the Hebron 
incidents and the political situation. 
  The prime minister called on the Palestinians to act like 
Israel and to totally separate between the Hebron incident and 
the continuation of the political process. Our correspondent 
Sheli Yehimovich reports the prime minister reiterated that as 
an Israeli, a Jew, and a human being, he is ashamed that an 
Israeli Jew perpetrated this massacre. He emphasized, however, 
that there is no proof that it was part of an organized action.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says he hopes and 
knows that the peace negotiations will be resumed. Speaking to 
the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish 
Organizations, he said the massacre at the mosque in Hebron 
would be remembered as the Black Friday of the Jewish people. 
Rabin was asked if he would accept the PLO's demand for an 
international force in the territories to protect the 
Palestinians: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] In the DOP [Declaration of 
Principles], it is written international presence but not 
international forces presence, and we offer that in the context 
of the Gaza-Jericho First, we will not oppose representatives or 
international presence of certain individuals in Gaza and 
Jericho -- not a force, not armed people. This is part of the 
DOP. Whatever we sign, we'll stick to it. All the other 
demands I believe that you mentioned -- dismantling of 
settlements, no; disarm of all arms from settlers, no. [end

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said we have suffered 
a heavy blow in international public opinion in the wake of the 
Hebron massacre, but he hopes it will not last long and tourism 
to Israel will not be harmed. The prime minister told Labor's 
caucus that it is Israel's aim to bring about gradual calm 
because in the final analysis the solution to the problem is 
political. We will, however, continue to act against 
Palestinian terrorism and Jewish extremists. The prime minister 
stressed that Israel is determined to uphold the agreements with 
the PLO and to continue the negotiations. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres sharply attacked right-wing extremists at the 
caucus meeting. Peres expressed shock not only at the appalling 
massacre, but also the rejoicing and gloating by the extreme 
right. What is most frightening is that Qiryat Arba' is a 
hotbed for the murder; we have no dialogue with those people, 
Peres said. They can cause a terrible catastrophe to the Jewish 
people, they are the enemies of the people, and they have to be 
treated like enemies. The man who perpetrated the massacre in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs has been damned to hell. His 
cohorts, who are now strutting like peacocks, have to have their 
weapons confiscated, and a series of measures have to be taken 
against them in order to prevent them from causing more damage 
and we must not hesitate.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>
  [Text] For the first time ever, Israel is prepared to 
allow the deployment of forces under international supervision 
in Gaza and Jericho. This emerged this evening in consultations 
held by the prime minister and the foreign minister. A check 
conducted by our correspondent reveals that a majority is 
emerging in the cabinet in favor of evacuating the settlers from 
the heart of Hebron. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el 
Rosen reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] Shim'on Peres set the tone in 
yesterday's cabinet session, when he called on his fellow 
ministers to comply with the new demands of the Palestinians. 
Today he reiterated as much it in public. 
  [Peres] To the extent that their demands are sensible, they 
will be examined. For example, if the Palestinians say the size 
of the police force must be increased, I believe it is a 
legitimate demand which requires pointed discussion. 
  [Rosen] It is now clear that the cabinet's decisions are not 
enough, and that the PLO will have to be given more. Some 
ministers, including hawks such as Ya'aqov Tzur, argue that much 
more than 30 settlers must be disarmed and their movements must 
be restricted. 
  More radical proposals have been floated in the cabinet. For 
example, there apparently is a majority in favor of evacuating 
the settlers from Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and Tall al-Rumaythah 
in Hebron. Half the cabinet ministers are unequivocally in 
favor of such a move: The four ministers of Meretz -- Shulamit 
Aloni, Ya'ir Tzaban, Yosi Sarid, and Amnon Rubinstein -- as well 
as Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, Yisra'el Qeysar, 'Uzi Bar'am, and 
Mikha Harish, who makes his consent conditional on such a demand 
coming from the defense establishment. 
  Three ministers oppose it: Shim'on Shetrit, Ya'aqov Tzur, 
and Ora Namir. The latter favors such a move, but does not 
believe it is feasible. 
  Two other ministers, Moshe Shahal and Shim'on Peres, refused 
to answer. One minister, David Liba'i, said he is not 
knowledgeable on the matter. Nevertheless, it is hard to see 
any of them voting against such a proposal if it is raised. 
  We could not obtain the answer of Minister Avraham Shohat. 
Yitzhaq Rabin is opposed to reopening the Declaration of 
Principles, but it is not certain that he perceives the 
evacuation of Hebron as falling in that category. When we asked 
him about it today, he replied: I am not prepared to elaborate. 
[end recording] 
  [Later in the broadcast, the announcer adds: "The Council of 
Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is furious at 
our report that most ministers are in favor of removing the 
settlers from the heart of Hebron." In a recorded passage, 
local settlement leader Elyaqim Ha'etzni states: "If they touch 
any settlement, including the Jewish settlement in Hebron, all 
of us to the last man will prevent it. Nobody will stay alone 
here. Not even one brick will be removed from this edifice. 
Let this much be clear. We will be followed in our footsteps 
by every Jewish patriot in Eretz Yisra'el. Indeed, all of us 
here will not allow them to tear us apart one by one. They will 
not start with Hebron, which may very well be the most precious 
of all our settlements."]

  [Excerpts] By a large majority, the Knesset today approved 
the joint decision by most factions which condemns the massacre 
in Hebron: 93 Knesset members supported the joint statement, 
one opposed, and seven abstained. Joining in the statement were 
Labor, the Likud, Meretz, SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim], the 
National Religious Party, Tzomet, YI'UD [Independent and 
Democratic Israel], Moledet, and United Torah Jewry. The HADASH 
[Democratic Front for Peace and Equality] and the Arab 
Democratic Party submitted a different draft proposal which was 
rejected by a vast majority. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that several of the 
Meretz faction members did not participate in the vote while 
other Meretz members abstained due to their opposition to the 
clause in the announcement which takes exception to any 
generalizations or sweeping blame against certain sectors, 
including the settlers.

<F P=106> [Address by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu to the Knesset </F>
plenum on the 25 February Hebron massacre -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. Speaker, Members of the Knesset: A despicable 
crime was committed in Hebron last Friday [25 February]. In the 
same place were Abraham announced to the world the belief in one 
God, dozens of people were slain while praying to that same God. 
Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; 
for God made man in his own image, the Bible says. In other 
words, a murderer should be killed, but there is no mercy, 
forgiveness, or redemption for bloodshed that does not 
distinguish between a base murderer and innocent citizens. 
  On behalf of my colleagues, and I believe in the name of all 
the members of this House, I utterly denounce this terrible act 
and send condolences to the families of the victims. 
  I urge educators throughout the political spectrum and 
rabbis 
to close ranks around the sanctity of human life and the moral 
use of arms which has always characterized us. Even a people 
fighting for its survival, such as the Jewish people, must 
uphold its moral standards in war. 
  Mr. Speaker, last Friday, all these rules were broken. 
Consequently, the government decided to set up a state 
commission of inquiry to thoroughly investigate the murder and 
find the truth. I would like to discuss what this committee 
must investigate and what should be included in its letter of 
appointment. I would like to tell you that a few hours ago I 
phoned the foreign minister, who heads the ministerial committee 
assigned to formulate the commission's letter of appointment, 
and asked him to add several points. First, we call for an 
investigation of all the facts and factors related to the 
horrendous act perpetrated in Hebron. The word factors may not 
be clear to the members of the House and, indeed, it does not 
appear in the letter of appointment as reported in the media. 
According to reports, the government asks the commission of 
inquiry to investigate and arrive at findings and conclusions 
with regard to the facts and circumstances pertaining to the 
massacre. 
  Mr. Speaker, I went back and looked up another commission of 
inquiry, the Kahn Commission, set up to probe another tragic 
affair, the killings in Sabra and Shatila. The letter of 
appointment issued to it by another government stated as 
follows: The government asks the commission of inquiry to 
investigate all the facts and factors pertaining to the 
horrendous acts -- the exact same words we are seeking. 
  I would like to tell you that the word factors was added at 
the firm and resolute demand of then-Attorney General Mr. 
Yitzhaq Zamir. After all, we are not just talking about facts 
and circumstances; there are also factors and people 
responsible. I do not know who is responsible and I would not 
presume to say anything like that. However, when you formulated 
the letter of appointment -- it was worded by well-known jurists 
whose professionalism I greatly appreciate, including two former 
justice ministers and the current attorney general -- did you 
not have the letter of appointment of the Kahn Commission in 
front of you? Is it just a coincidence that this specific word 
is absent? Are there only facts and no factors? Has the 
whitewashing already begun? Do not put the blame on the foot 
soldier; in this case, Major Ilan, the commander at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs. If anybody is responsible, the word factors -- 
as it pertains to responsibility -- should be included. 
Although responsibility should not be determined at this point, 
it should be stated that somebody is responsible. Otherwise, 
what is the sense of the whole thing? Did you not foresee it? 
  Under the Likud government, a commission of inquiry set up 
to investigate a horrendous slaughter saw fit to look into the 
factors leading to it. Confronted with a no less horrendous 
massacre, the Labor government does not see fit to look into the 
factors. 
  Mr. Foreign Minister, it is not yet too late. The government 
can meet and amend its decision. If you want the public to 
perceive the mandate of the commission of inquiry as being 
state-like rather than of a political or partisan nature, amend 
the letter of appointment. 
  What else should the commission investigate? No doubt, it 
must investigate the events pertaining to the tragic murder of 
some 40 innocent Arabs in the Cave of the Patriarchs, but it 
must also probe the no less abominable slaying of over 30 
Israelis -- according to data in my possession, 33 Israelis were 
killed; not all of them were Jews, some were Druze -- in the 
last few months. Does only the murder of Arabs, however 
despicable and abominable, merit a commission of inquiry, 
whereas the slaying of dozens of Jews and Druze -- as well as 
hundreds of Arabs in the territories who were considered 
collaborators and were murdered by Arab terrorists -- does not? 
  Mr. Speaker, we listened attentively to the speech of the 
prime minister, who made a series of remarks which were not to 
our liking. The commission of inquiry must probe the whole 
question of the deterioration of the security situation. These 
events did not take place in a vacuum. Since 13 September, when 
the Oslo agreement was signed, things have been happening in the 
field, including a surge in the number of murders. Why is this 
happening? It is not happening because of facts, but because of 
the decisions and actions of the government. For example, you 
allowed the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] deportees to 
return although you were specifically warned that they had 
undergone special terrorist training. You allowed them back 
nevertheless, thus pouring boiling oil on the blazing bonfire of 
terror. You pardoned dozens of wanted men, and threw them into 
the bonfire as well. You released hundreds of terrorists. 
  Now, instead of coming to your senses and seeing the 
situation for what it is, instead of regaining your 
level-headedness and stopping this succession of capitulations 
and gestures, what do you do? What do you have in store for us 
now? What lies in store for us in the next few days is the 
release of yet another 800 to 1,000 terrorists; more terrorists, 
more boiling oil. What is worse, in the not too distant future, 
if we approve the process you are now trying to accelerate with 
all your might, you will bring into our midst another 8,000 
murderers -- not potential murderers as the assassin in Hebron, 
but certified ones. 
  That is why we demand to add a clause to the letter of 
appointment. We want and demand that the commission of inquiry 
investigate the serious deterioration in the security situation 
since the signing of the agreement with the PLO, including the 
murder of dozens of Israeli citizens throughout the country, as 
well as the murder of dozens of Arab inhabitants of the 
territories by Arab terrorists. I would like to add, Mr. 
Speaker, that if these events are not investigated now they will 
be probed by the next commission of inquiry which has yet to be 
set up. 
  Mr. Speaker, Judaism does not uphold punishing an entire 
community for the sins of one individual. We do not believe in 
or accept the concept of collective responsibility, and we will 
definitely not stigmatize the entire community of settlers in 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza; a community of law-abiding people and 
pioneers; of people who have for six years been subjected to a 
ceaseless onslaught of terror but behaved in a manner which only 
arouses respect and should be an example to all of us; people 
who drive in their cars with their children on roads where a 
woman five-months pregnant is slaughtered and the father of nine 
children is slain together with his son. These people have 
displayed supreme heroism, and are for the most part -- and this 
is an understatement -- law-abiding. We do not accept the 
current notion of mentioning them in the same breath with a 
handful of extremists who must be dealt with the utmost severity 
within the confines of the law. The latter should be dealt 
with, but not so the vast majority. We ought to watch over this 
majority and not lend a hand to harming a community of people 
who are the emissaries of the State of Israel and of generations 
of the Jewish people. 
  However, that is exactly what you are trying to do. In the 
last few days, the media has been waging a slanderous and 
venomous campaign. Not just the media, but also cabinet 
ministers have been describing the settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza as a hotbed of murderers. I hear talk about 
separation -- a euphemism for uprooting the Jewish population 
from Hebron, Bet El, Ari'el, and 'Imanu'el -- and I say: If the 
answer to terror in Hebron is uprooting Jews from Hebron, the 
solution to possible terror in Yafo is uprooting Jews from Yafo, 
Nazareth, 'Akko, and any other place where Jews and Arabs live 
side by side. There is no solution other than coexistence. 
Those who demand our expulsion from Hebron as a solution are 
doomed to flee other places as well. 
  Mr. Speaker, Hebron, the city of the common patriarchs of 
the 
Jewish and Arab peoples, must be the place where Jews and Arabs 
learn to live and to pray side by side. However, the 
coexistence we advocate cannot grow and develop on the basis of 
an unfortunate policy which forsakes the security of both Jews 
and Arabs. We call on the government to return to a sane, 
responsible policy. Only in such a policy lies the chance of 
curbing this horrendous bloodshed. A responsible policy will 
ensure that we can continue to tread this arduous and tortuous 
road -- albeit the only one we believe in -- of peaceful 
coexistence between Arabs and Jews in Eretz Yisra'el. 
  I would like to conclude with a word to Israel's Arabs: You 
are citizens of this country. Through great efforts, we built a 
life together, a successful delicate fabric. I call on your 
leaders not to lend a hand to its destruction, to calm tempers, 
to put down the violence, and to come out against it, just as I 
call on my colleagues in the left wing of the House to curb the 
hatred and the venom. Let us argue to the point -- and we do 
have an outstanding argument -- but not by resorting to 
uncalled-for hatred. We have only one nation and only one 
state, and let us maintain both of them.

vehemently objected to the impending release of hundreds of 
security prisoners and demanded that the state commission of 
inquiry also investigate the government's responsibility for the 
terrorist acts perpetrated against Jews. As for the 
restrictions placed on the hardcore extremist settlers in the 
territories, this is what Binyamin Netanyahu had to say: 
  [Begin Netanyahu recording] If steps are called for against 
agitators or against people who assist or participate in acts of 
terrorism, then such action is legitimate; however, if the 
government's intention is to expand the scope of these measures 
to include large groups of settlers, who are the vast majority 
-- to say the least -- of the settler population, then it will 
constitute an abuse of authority that must not be sanctioned. 
Selective, strictly pinpointed action against lawbreakers is 
acceptable to us. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] More than 500 Palestinian prisoners are being 
released from jails in the territories and inside Israel today, 
with more due to be set free later this week. But local 
Palestinian leaders have ordered no celebrations and they have 
made it clear that the gesture is not enough to bring the 
Palestinians back to the peace talks. On this, Mark Weiss 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [break in reception] 
[Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi, broadcast in progress] ...approaching a 
reluctant conciliatory attitude. I mean Rabin cannot always 
approach issues by trying to carry out cosmetic changes and by 
doing too little too late. We are not looking for appearance. 
We are looking for serious substance, and therefore I think 
that moves or steps that appear to be steps of appeasement 
rather than drastic or genuine dealing with serious issues would 
not achieve results. 
  [Weiss] What specifically do you want Israel to do that is 
realistic, that could possibly bring the Palestinians back to 
the talks? 
  ['Ashrawi] I think what is very realistic is to accept an 
international presence, not by putting limits on what is in the 
DOP [Declaration of Principles] and saying international 
civilians are unarmed, but rather by making the international 
presence of a serious international force that would be able to 
play the role of a buffer zone to observe and to monitor, to 
prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and to change the 
whole atmosphere. I also think that disarming the settlers is 
not unrealistic at all. It's a genuine requirement which would 
serve both sides, because they are also challenging the rule of 
law in Israel. I think beginning the removal of the settlers 
from the populated areas, particularly in al-Khalil and Qiryat 
Arba', would also show seriousness of intent and a genuine 
commitment to deal with these issues. 
  [Weiss] Other Palestinians noted that today's release is 
only bringing forward the release planned for later this month 
to mark the end of Ramadan. [end recording] 
  The view from the Likud is that the release of Palestinian 
prisoners encourages and solicits terrorist activity against 
Jews. Likud faction chairman Moshe Qatzav accuses the government 
of surrendering and ingratiating itself in front of Yasir 
'Arafat. The Moledet party, claiming the release complicated 
Israel's security situation, said the government had not learned 
from the experience of the prisoner exchange with the Ahmad 
Jibril organization.

  [Text] The release of 900 Palestinian prisoners will take 
place today. This is reported by our correspondent Moti Amir. 
In one hour, 400 hundred prisoners will be released from the 
al-Zahiriyah prison. The first batch from among the 500 
prisoners to be released from Qezi'ot today were released half 
an hour ago. Our correspondent reports that prisoners from 
Judaea and Samaria are being released from Qezi'ot this morning, 
while Gaza Strip prisoners will be released this afternoon. 
  Sufyan al-Zaydan, the Fatah spokesman in Gaza, says today's 
release of Palestinian prisoners will not bring the PLO back to 
the negotiating table because the number of those being released 
is insufficient.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Feb 25 (AFP) -- A well-trained man armed 
with an Israeli Galil assault rifle can kill more than 100 
people in a closed space within minutes, a senior military 
officer told AFP. 
  The officer said a clip for the Galil 5.56 mm assault rifle 
clip holds 35 bullets. 
  "If a man is properly trained, he can change a clip in a few 
seconds," he said. 
  The Galil, brought into service at the end of the 1970's, is 
considered heavy and less accurate than the M-16 and used only 
by tank units now. 
  "With a gun like that in a closed space you can kill more 
than 100 people." 
  It weighs 3.75 kilos and has a theoretically ability to fire 
750 bullets a minute. 
  The army said a sole killer, 35-year-old Barukh Goldstein, 
opened fire in a packed Hebron mosque at dawn on Friday. 
Palestinian doctors said 53 people died and dozens were wounded 
in the carnage. 
  However several Palestinian witnesses said up to five Jewish 
settlers aided the American-born doctor with links to the 
anti-Arab Kach movement. He either turned the gun on himself or 
was shot by someone else, military officials said. 
  Yet another Palestinian who said he was in the mosque told 
Israeli television that Goldstein was alone and re-loaded his 
rifle with at least three of four or five bullet clips he 
carried. 
  Police announced that a ballistics test would be carried out 
to verify if all the bullets in the mosque came from the same 
gun. Police said they were contacting witnesses to take their 
testimony.

compensation to the families of the Hebron massacre victims, the 
total amount of funds to be paid will amount to dozens of 
millions of shekels. This is reported by our correspondent 
Ya'el Ayalon. The payment will be a one-time compensation to the 
families of the dead and the wounded. During the first stage, 
each family who lost one of its members will receive an advance 
payment of 5,000 shekels. Ora Namir, labor and social welfare 
minister, says this is a humanitarian step. National Insurance 
Institute Chairman Yosi Tamir notes that this move is not 
intended to set a precedent.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed and Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpt] Wide-ranging security measures have been taken 
around the country for fear of retaliatory terrorist attacks in 
the wake of the Hebron massacre. 
  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] sources warned the secretariats 
of settlements belonging to the Mate Binyamin Regional Council 
[between Jerusalem and Ramallah] of terrorist plans to 
perpetrate a spectacular attack against one or more of the 
settlements there. A very high state of alert was declared in 
the Mate Binyamin settlements, and the IDF has dramatically 
beefed up its forces in the region. 
  A particularly sharp pamphlet published yesterday by the 
Palestinian command in the territories, which includes PLO 
representatives, said: "The Zionist enemy must be aware that no 
crime goes unavenged. Those who spill the blood of our people 
will not go unscathed. We will set the ground under the feet of 
the Nazi occupiers on fire." 
  The Palestinian leadership in the territories has renewed 
the 
activities of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah, 
in cooperation with Fatah, and called for the resumption of 
intifadah activities, including violence against IDF forces and 
settlers, in order to cause as many casualties and as much 
damage to property as possible. As will be recalled, the 
command was disbanded after the signing of the Washington 
agreement in September, but it was reestablished on Sunday. 
  Sources in the territories noted that the command was 
reestablished with the cooperation of Fatah representatives and 
that its demands are a signal to 'Arafat that conducting 
negotiations does not mean control on the ground. The sources 
said that as a result of the erosion in 'Arafat's status, he has 
no choice but to radicalize his positions and to accept the 
demands of the leadership in the territories. [passage omitted]

at one of the workers, but caused no damage. In Rafah, a youth 
was badly injured by soldiers after he threw rocks at them.

were injured in a violent clash between the police and 
demonstrators protesting the Hebron killings. Our correspondent 
Nisim Qeynan reports that the police detained six of the

use tear gas to disperse the demonstrating Bedouin. Riots also 
took place in the villages of Kusayfah, 'Aro'er, and Laggiyah. 
  In al-Tirah in the triangle, a police officer was stabbed in 
the back a short while ago. Our correspondent Yafa Glick

clashes with IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers, one in 
Nabulus and another in Hebron. Another 17 Arabs were wounded: 
three were seriously wounded in Nabulus, one was moderately 
injured in the village of Tuqu', and 13 were wounded in the Gaza 
Strip. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that a riot occurred 
near 
the Cave of the Patriarchs, and an IDF soldier was lightly 
wounded by a stone. 
  Disturbances continue in East Jerusalem, particularly in 
Shu'fat and in Al-Tur. Our police affairs correspondent Aviv 
Bushinsky reports that the rioters set tires on fire and threw 
stones at Border Police units. In East Jerusalem's central bus 
station, a burning object was thrown at an empty bus and the 
driver's seat was lightly damaged. 
  Some 1,500 people marched in Haifa for the second day in a 
mourning procession over the massacre in Hebron. They marched 
from Wadi Nisnas to the municipality building. One of the 
speakers was Haifa Mayor 'Amram Mitzna'. Our correspondent Nati 
Zilberman reports that a stone was thrown at a police patrol car 
during the procession, but nobody was hurt. A 14-year-old boy 
who threw the stone was detained for questioning.

<F P=106> [Report by Dani Gur-Arye] </F>
  [Excerpts] Once again today, Palestinians clashed with 
Israeli troops on both sides of the Green Line. Once again, 
casualties and arrests. 
  In the territories residents defied the curfew in effect 
almost everywhere in the West Bank and Gaza, blocking roads, 
burning tires, and throwing stones. The most severe incident 
took place in Salfit, near Tulkarm, where some 60 residents 
surrounded an Army outpost, showering it with stones, bottles, 
and petrol bombs. Soldiers emerged on foot to disperse the 
demonstrators. They opened fire when one of the youths 
brandished a knife. Five demonstrators were wounded, two 
seriously. [passage omitted] 
  More troubling for the authorities are the ongoing 
demonstrations in Arab communities within the Green Line. The 
focus of the unrest shifted to Galilee today, where some 50 
Israeli Arabs were arrested. In Nazareth youths blocked the main 
road and threw stones at the bank, the post office, and 
government offices. Police initially refrained from entering 
the city in large numbers, but moved in early in the afternoon 
to break up the demonstrations. Thirty three people were 
arrested in the city. There were also large demonstrations in 
Kafr Kana and Baqa al-Gharbiyah. 
  In East Jerusalem, two policemen and eight Palestinians were 
wounded in clashes today. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 28 February 
adds that "a Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car at 
the Armon Hanetziv neighborhood this evening. The car was not 
damaged. A rented car was set on fire at Wadi al-Jawz in East 
Jerusalem, and a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Border Police 
vehicle in the Old City of Jerusalem, but the vehicle was not 
damaged. There were no casualties in these three incidents. 
  ["In the center of Hebron, several shots were directed at an 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrol not far from Gross Square. 
There were no casualties. The patrol soldiers returned fire 
and began searches." 
  [Also, "six masked people were caught in the village of 
Abu-Dis in East Jerusalem; two youths who threw Molotov 
cocktails at the security forces in Khan Yunus were detained; 
and five youths who were on their way to committing arson were 
caught at Wadi al-Jawz in East Jerusalem."]

  [Text] The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza which convened today to discuss the security 
situation has announced its objection to the expressions of joy 
over the murder in Hebron. This is included in a series of 
decisions adopted by the heads of the council during their 
meeting. Our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon reports that it was 
further decided that in the future the council will hold an 
extensive discussion about the attitude toward the Kakh 
movement. The council has also decided to launch an information 
campaign within the settlements so as to curb the activities of 
Kakh members. The first in a series of decisions made by the 
council expresses deep sorrow and shock about the murder in 
Hebron. The council heads also categorically condemn any harm 
inflicted on innocent people, share in the grief of the victims' 
families, and repudiate the expressions of joy regarding the 
murder. 
  The other decisions adopted by the council takes a negative 
view of the measures the government adopted yesterday.

administrative detention, and he expressed confidence that they 
will be found soon. He said some Kakh activists will be totally 
disarmed, and others will only have their automatic weapons 
taken away. He called the crack down on the extreme right an 
extraordinary act for a democratic country. However, he 
stressed that Kakh has less than 100 members and Kahana Hay even 
less, and he does not believe they have large numbers of 
sympathizers. 
  Shahal said he opposes the dismantling of the Jewish 
community in Hebron and the settlement of Qiryat Arba', because 
this would mean a major change in the Declaration of Principles. 
The major problem, he said, remains ensuring the security of 
Israelis. 
  [Shahal] We didn't have any guarantee from the Palestinians 
that they are going to prevent any kind of terror or violence. 
Still, we are optimistic enough to go on with the process. So, 
there is no need to come after this act, horrible as it was, and 
to change an agreement between the Palestinians and Israel. 
They have our guarantee that the Israeli Government will 
prevent any kind of terror or violent act, and we are doing more 
than any other country that I know of with all of our ability to 
do so. There is no question about it. 
  [Weiss] The police minister predicted that the Palestinian 
police force will remain somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000 
strong, and will not be significantly increased because of the 
massacre. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "On Appointments to the Next </F>
General Staff"] 
  [Text] The military advocate general's report on the 
Ze'elim B accident freed the bottleneck on appointments in the 
IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] top ranks. The reason, in fact 
the excuse, for artificially holding up appointments of new 
generals to the General Staff has been removed. But things are 
not as simple as they may appear to outsiders. When the cabinet 
approved extending the chief of staff's term by another year, 
Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq announced that he intends to 
complete his term on 1 January, 1995, which leaves him another 
10 months in office. 
  That means that Baraq is about to decide months prior to his 
retirement on the appointment of most of the generals in the 
General Staff of his successor, who is already waiting for the 
job. Had that been done a year or two ago, it could have 
passed. The general practice is that the chief of staff is 
allowed to chose some of the generals he wants on his team. 
This time, the next chief of staff will not be given the 
opportunity to influence many key appointments. The makeup of 
his General Staff will be decided now for many years to come. 
  The next chief of staff will most likely by Major General 
Amnon Shahaq, who is currently the preferred candidate of 
Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister. Shahaq 
should have no less impact on the character of the future IDF 
top brass than Baraq. The defense minister should hold 
consultations on that also with the person who will be chief of 
staff in another 10 months. 
  The extended delay in making the appointments due to the 
Ze'elim accident was superfluous. The more prolonged the 
military advocate general's investigation became the more 
deferring the round of appointments became a burden. The 
mistake was not in the extended terms of the current generals, 
but in the link Baraq and Rabin formed between the Ze'elim 
accident and the appointment of new generals who have nothing to 
do with the accident. The problem is that even now that link 
has not been totally severed. 
  The chief of staff was right in not appointing Major General 
'Amiram Levin to a senior post immediately after receiving an 
administrative reprimand. That was why it was suggested that in 
the first stage there would only be a small round of 
appointments. But there could have been "a small round" a long 
time ago, before the military advocate general's findings were 
presented. The current round will apparently include 
appointments to the Central Command, the National Defense 
College, and field commands. If Baraq wants to appoint 'Amiram 
Levin to the Central Command he has to put off the change of 
guard at that command. The significance of the "small round" is 
that once again there will be a hold up in appointments and once 
again officers who had nothing to do with the Ze'elim affair 
have been affected. 
  Shortening the chief of staff's final year ends the chances 
that a different senior officer will become deputy chief of 
staff before a decision is made on who will succeed Baraq. In 
recent weeks, Baraq tried to persuade Shahaq to take a year off 
for rest or study, thereby enabling another officer to be tried 
out in the post. Shahaq was not excited about the suggestion but 
left it up to the defense minister to decide. The latter, 
however, does not tend to make drastic decisions on such 
personal issues, and since Shahaq did not request taking time 
off for studies, the situation has remained unchanged. 
  That plan has now been removed from the agenda since there 
is 
no point in appointing a chief of the Operations Branch and 
deputy chief of staff for only nine months. Appointment of a 
Operations Branch chief must be made for several years, 
especially since that general will also be the next deputy chief 
of staff. 
  Chief of Staff Baraq has not had too much luck with 
appointments. Several senior appointments during his term were 
made without his approval (such as the appointment of Yitzhaq 
Mordekhay as commander of the Northern Command). Other 
appointments are not considered a success. 
  In the coming 10 months not only will the next chief of 
staff 
be appointed, but the three regional commanders, the deputy 
chief of staff, head of the Intelligence Branch, and possibly 
other senior officers will be decided. Two veteran generals 
will necessarily be disappointed. Waiting on the sidelines is a 
new generation of brigadier generals, some very good and some 
less so. 
  The next General Staff must have not only talented, highly 
professional officers with a strategic-political outlook; we 
must also make sure it is truly balanced. Reserve General 
Yisra'el Tal, who has been claiming for some time that we must 
make doubly sure that the IDF top echelon should always include 
commanders with experience in managing complex formations, who 
would naturally come from the Armored Corps, is right. The 
person who has to supervise that balancing act is the defense 
minister, who must consider the overall appointments picture.

  [Text] What could move the sleeping conscience of the world 
more than the ugly massacre at the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron 
today? What could awaken feelings anesthetized by injections of 
Israeli deception more than images of innocent blood shed in the 
holy place in Hebron? What sanctities do those -- who claim to 
be the descendants of Abraham -- believe in while they shed 
innocent blood in the Ibrahimi mosque? What act of 
international terrorism can be compared with what was committed 
by the sinful Zionist hand against innocent Palestinians in 
Hebron today? 
  This is one of a series of similar Zionist terrorist acts 
that have continued since before 1948. They will not stop as 
long as Zionists continue their arrogance and sin without 
meeting deterrence from anyone in the name of humanity, 
international legitimacy, or international determination to stop 
their recklessness. They will not stop as long these Zionists 
continue to see the world's silence about their crimes as 
collusion giving them a free hand to desecrate anything, with no 
deterrence of their oppression, terrorism, ambitions, and 
violations of all noble and honorable human values coming from 
anyone. 
  What is the reaction of the NATO members, who were justly 
shocked by the market crime against scores of innocent people in 
Sarajevo almost two weeks ago? Then, they issued a warning to 
the killers and delivered an ultimatum, and the killers bowed to 
the warning. Doesn't Arab blood incite any reaction from them, 
or even any feeling of sympathy or mercy? It should not be 
understood from this that Arabs are begging for sympathy or 
mercy from anyone, or that they are waiting for another 
international condemnation or denunciation statement. All the 
international condemnation statements have not restored any of 
their rights and have not stopped the violent onslaught of 
Zionist terrorism and aggression. So far, all the international 
resolutions have failed to enable Palestinians and Arabs to 
restore any of their rights, because those who control the 
international will lack the firm determination to force Israel 
to pay attention to these resolutions. 
  Moreover, rather than employing effective international 
pressure on Israel to heed international legitimacy's 
resolutions and principles, we have seen acts of collusion 
represented by silence or carelessness in order to circumvent 
this legitimacy. The result of this is the daily horrible 
massacres and crimes Zionists commit against innocent 
Palestinians, without concern for values, norms, or principles. 
  The Israeli Government cannot dissociate itself from the 
crime of massacre committed at the Ibrahimi mosque today by 
claiming it was the act of an extremist or a deranged Zionist, 
or that of a Zionist with any other adjective that may be 
attributed to him in order to cover up the ugliness of the crime. 
  Direct responsibility for this crime, and for any other 
crime 
committed by Zionist settlers or occupation forces, is 
shouldered by the Tel Aviv rulers who insisted, and are 
insisting, on keeping the Arab land they usurped, and who 
encouraged, and are encouraging, the settlers to remain on this 
land. 
  The Tel Aviv rulers, who fabricated and ignored the facts of 
history and geography, rejected the principles of justice and 
disrespected the resolutions of international legitimacy, and 
considered occupied Palestinian land a disputed land to which 
Zionist settlers have more right than its original owners -- 
these rulers are the ones who planted, and are planting, the 
seeds of terrorism that were terribly manifested today in the 
Ibrahimi mosque massacre. 
  We have said and warned more than once that what Israel is 
doing in the name of the so-called peace that it is hiding 
behind is nothing more than aggravating elements of tension and 
explosion, spreading terrorism, and endangering stability and 
security in the region. 
  What happened today is only one part of these elements. This 
will continue as long as Israel remains unrestrained and free 
from any control that deters its extravagance and stops its 
crimes and terrorism. 
  Will the world wake up and pay attention before it is too 
late, before Israel pushes the entire region, by its antipeace 
positions and practices, to the edge of an explosion?

  [Text] Gentlemen: The horrendous, treacherous, and savage 
Israeli crime against Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, which left hundreds of dead and wounded, has been 
greeted with universal condemnation and distress. This 
despicable crime brings to mind other Zionist massacres, like 
Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and al-Samu'. Political 
analysts and observers are unified in their position that the 
massacre was the natural upshot of unrelenting occupation and 
settlement activity. They point out that to discuss peace while 
occupation and settlement activity continue is an exercise in 
futility and that, if there is to be peace in the region, 
occupation must end, settlements must be dismantled and settlers 
repatriated. 
  The savage Zionist massacre was perpetrated in full view of 
the Israeli military, who checked the identity of worshipers 
before their entry into the mosque. During 10 minutes of heavy 
firing at the backs of kneeling worshipers, none of the Israeli 
military personnel acted to halt the carnage. With a hail of 
fire raining at innocent Arabs from different corners, the 
massacre was a systematic act, the scenario of which must have 
been mapped out by the higher settlement council. The outrage 
was a message to Arabs and the world that racist, expansionist 
Zionism and its characteristically blood-thirsty savagery are 
still there, and that peace rhetoric is so much lip service. 
  Zionism and criminality are natural twins. Zionism cannot 
possibly be a peaceable movement, since it would thus be at 
cross purposes with it own psyche and objectives. Right from 
the beginning of the peace process and the Washington talks, the 
Arab negotiating teams sought an end to Israeli settlement 
activity and Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories, 
with the Israeli Government consistently offering a negative 
response to these basic demands. Indeed, Israel has put up 
hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. loan guarantees to 
expand existing settlements, build new outposts, and arm 
settlers. The Israeli Government went even further and 
introduced joint military-settler patrols. Furthermore, leaders 
of the settler community have issued threats to carry out 
massacres against Arabs in the occupied territories. It came to 
light recently that Zionist settlers have started an armed 
organization. Rabbis have been urging Israelis to commit murder 
and drive Arabs from their homes. Only a couple of days ago, 
the Zionist settlers in the occupied Golan Heights declared 
their full confidence in Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
for his support and encouragement. They are known to make it a 
habit to provoke our people in the Golan and to stage violent 
demonstrations in order to send the message that Israel is not 
about to vacate the occupied Syrian territories. 
  All these acts of aggression culminated in the monstrous 
crime against the peaceful worshipers. They point to the Rabin 
government's involvement in this murderous episode. They prove 
beyond a shadow of doubt that any bargain with Israel that does 
not provide for the withdrawal of the Israeli military and 
settlers from the occupied territory is not worth the ink in 
which it is written. 
  Peace and occupation and settlements are strange bedfellows. 
The ABC's of Middle East peace require an Israeli pullout from 
all occupied Arab territories and their devolution to their 
rightful owners' control. Yesterday's massacre must be directly 
or indirectly laid at the door of the Oslo and Cairo agreements 
and whatever other pact may follow. Talk about Palestinian 
self-rule while Israeli occupation and armed settlements remain 
is a waste of time and a stab in the back of the Palestinian 
people's struggle. It legitimizes a state of affairs rejected by 
U.N. resolutions and whets the appetite of Zionist settlers to 
perpetrate further atrocities. 
  It seems Palestinian negotiators forgot Israel's 
crime-ridden 
track record, and were too trustful and unsuspecting, thereby 
facilitating the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  Condemnations and denunciations, no matter how strongly 
worded, are not good enough. The international community must 
shoulder its responsibilities and work toward dislodging the 
Israeli occupation and settlers if it cares enough about a just 
and universal peace in the Middle East. Throughout two years of 
negotiations in Washington, the Arabs never detected an Israeli 
willingness to pull out from the occupied territories, cease 
settlement activity, or disband settlements. All this, then, 
when total Israeli withdrawal is a key requirement for any 
progress toward peace. The community of nations and the 
sponsors of the peace process will have to immediately intervene 
to end Israel's equivocation, instead of pressing for an end of 
the Arab boycott of Israel and a blueprint for regional 
cooperation incorporating Israel. The UN Security Council, 
which convened to consider the grave situation, must state the 
need for a total Israeli withdrawal, settlement disbandment, and 
restitution of rights and territories.

  [Text] Gentlemen: The explosion during the Sunday mass at 
the Sayyidat al-Najat church in Juniyah today directly poses 
this question: Who is behind this treacherous act? Whose 
sinful hands have once again been extended in less than 48 hours 
to assassinate a new group of worshipers praying to God at the 
Juniyah church, exactly as their brothers were doing two days 
ago at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron? Who are those involved in 
killing the worshipers inside the houses of worship? Who are 
those who skillfully dissociate themselves from responsibility 
and hold others responsible? 
  Can anyone doubt the fact that there is a clear link between 
the Hebron massacre, perpetrated at the Ibrahimi Mosque during 
the dawn prayers, and the Sunday mass massacre at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat church in Juniyah? What objectives does this clear 
link between the two crimes conceal? The answers do not need 
much thought: It is the hands of rancor, extremism, and 
terrorism. These are the same hands that were created, planted, 
and sponsored by Israel in the region, giving rise to vehement 
rancor at the hands of ruthless and fanatic settlers. Thus, 
these settlers shed blood in a sacred place in Hebron. 
  These hands today dealt a treacherous new and mean blow to 
the Juniyah church through cheap agents who sold themselves, 
their conscience and homeland, and the blood of their brothers 
to the enemy at a cheap price. 
  No doubt, Israel is the party behind today's explosion in 
Juniyah. It seeks to achieve objectives that are known to 
everyone. Foremost among these objectives is to conceal the 
Hebron massacre and create an atmosphere of sedition and 
disturbance in Lebanon. Israel is the only party interested in 
fomenting such seditions, so they will spread not only in 
Lebanon but in the entire region, as well. Only in such an 
atmosphere can Israel conceal its crimes and its terrorism and 
exploit this situation in order to achieve its schemes designed 
to control Arab land and resources and this nation's destiny. 
  However, today's explosion cannot conceal those who are 
behind such crimes. In fact, today's crime urges the 
international community and the world to assume a greater 
responsibility for confronting the chain of Israeli crimes and 
massacres and taking deterrent measures to curb Zionist 
terrorism. We reiterate that this terrorism threatens the 
situation in the whole region with explosion. 
  Will the world contemplate this issue, make up its mind, and 
end Zionist terrorism and aggression before it is too late?

  [Text] Israel now stands accused before the entire world, 
ashamed and haunted by the curses of the innocent ones who were 
killed in the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque, the occupied Arab 
territories, and Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah as a result 
of the Zionist beast's rampage and indiscriminate shooting. 
Over 60 people were killed in the Ibrahimi Mosque in the 
horrible massacre that was carried out by settlers and covered 
by the Israeli Army. Hundreds were left wounded. In the 
occupied territories, 19 people were killed as of yesterday at 
the hands of the Israeli Army. Many were also wounded. 
  As for the Juniyah church massacre, Israel deliberately 
carried out this attack to distract attention away from the 
horrible Friday massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  In the face of the world's strong condemnation and rising 
calls for the protection of the Arab citizens in the occupied 
territories, Israel, as usual, has created a fog of falsehood. 
Its officials expressed regret and some of them alleged 
sorrow. Shim'on Peres went as far as saying that the settlers 
are a catastrophe for Israel, knowing that Shamir's former 
government and Rabin's current government gave priority to 
settlement activities. 
  Rabin himself saw to it that the settlers were armed and 
given all means of support and, only recently, his agriculture 
minister expanded a settlement in the Golan Heights. Both 
Shamir and Rabin blocked the peace talks in Washington and two 
years later, Israel has not yet pledged to withdraw from the 
occupied territories. 
  Rabin's main objective in singing the Oslo Agreement, and 
then holding negotiations to interpret it, was to maintain the 
settlements in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as arsenals, a sword 
hanging over the heads of the Palestinians. 
  Consequently, the alleged sorrow expressed by Israeli 
officials is a cheap attempt at deception. The return of 
stability, calm, and tranquility to the Middle East hinges on 
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories, the 
dismantling all forms of occupation, the end of all settlement 
activities, and the building of a just and comprehensive peace 
that protects everyone's rights. Israel has, thus far, rejected 
withdrawal, refused to halt settlement activities, and rejected 
just and comprehensive peace. 
  Even after the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which shocked 
and disgusted the world, Israeli terrorism continued to claim 
more innocent lives. The Palestinian people were punished and 
subjected to military siege and curfews, and the Lebanese 
people, who denounced the massacre, were punished by an Israeli 
bomb in Juniyah church. Meanwhile, the Zionist settlers, who 
committed the slaughter in cold blood, are moving around freely 
and celebrating the crime. The measures, which Rabin claims to 
have taken against the fanatical settlers, are aimed at throwing 
dust in the eyes of the world. 
  For over 40 years, Israel has been uprooting the Palestinian 
people from their land and property through force, terrorism, 
and massacres. The Friday massacre is not unusual in this 
Israeli trend. It is a continuation of the series of crimes, 
such as those in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, and al-Samu', 
and is aimed at terrorizing the Palestinian and forcing them to 
leave their land. 
  Thus, talking about peace in light of the serious Zionist 
escalation and Israel's continued refusal to withdraw from the 
occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of 
time. It is, indeed, absurd. For over two years, the Arab 
delegations have failed to prompt Israel to even pledge to 
withdraw from the occupied territories. 
  Friday's massacre and the ensuing events threaten that the 
situation in the region will deteriorate unless the world 
community takes resolute and effective moves to protect the 
Palestinian people, first and foremost. They must also stress 
that the Middle East peace hinges on Israel's full withdrawal 
from the occupied territories and its removal of the settlers, 
and that these issues cannot be delayed or postponed. The 
Western powers, who have provided all kinds of military and 
economic aid to Israel, are responsible for checking the rampage 
of the Israeli beast. There is no purpose or meaning in holding 
any peace talks that are not based on a clear Israeli commitment 
to implement the UN Security Council resolutions and withdraw 
from the occupied Arab territories.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN writes about the hideous 
massacre perpetrated by the Zionist settlers under the 
protection of the Israeli occupation forces in the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque in the occupied Palestinian city of Hebron yesterday. 
  The paper says: This massacre not only reminds us of the 
terrorist massacres and mass killings in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, 
Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar, Da'il, and al-Samu', it also proves 
the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as a 
result of the fascist Zionist rancor against the Arabs. 
  TISHRIN says: This massacre was premeditated, planned, and 
carefully studied. This is confirmed by the number of victims 
who were killed or wounded. This is also revealed by the 
killing of Palestinians which continued after the massacre at 
the hands of the occupation troops in Hebron, Bethlehem, the 
Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and Nabulus, and which also extended to 
Nazareth and the entire 1948 territories to 'Ayn Mahil, Kafr 
Kanna, and Umm al-Fahm until they reached the Golan. 
  TISHRIN adds: Our people's wrath indicates that occupation 
will inevitably vanish, that resistance must be escalated 
against all the manifestations and pillars of the occupation, 
and that capitulation and relinquishment of rights is 
calamitous, especially since the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre was 
only one of the manifestations and results of the Oslo agreement 
which gave Israel all that it wants and granted it all that 
would enable it to continue its occupation and impose its 
control on our people's destiny and their national and pan-Arab 
will. What kind of peace is that which was produced by the Oslo 
agreement? It is the peace of settlers who kill Arabs, violate 
honor, defile sanctities, control the land, and imposes 
capitulatory conditions. 
  TISHRIN stresses: Israel is still completely hostile to 
peace. It still adheres to all its crimes. It perpetrates 
massacres and falsely claims that they are perpetrated by 
individuals. It shamelessly conceal the facts of its hideous 
terroristic practices. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Although it is difficult to forget 
the results of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque without 
forcing Israel to pay the price for what it has done to our 
people, it has also unequivocally proved that occupation and 
peace cannot go together, and that the road to peace cannot pass 
through partial agreements and separate deals, but through the 
full termination of occupation and the achievement of a just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  In two articles, the newspaper also writes about the 
bloodbath at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of 
Hebron at dawn yesterday. Under the headline "Crime and 
Responsibility," AL-THAWRAH says: Yitzhaq Rabin's government 
has hastened to acquit itself of responsibility for the 
massacre and to hold one person responsible. It came out with 
several stories harmonizing with its known policy of blaming 
provocative mass carnages on deranged Israelis, as it claims. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Rabin government's disinformation 
campaign concerning this heinous massacre and its attempt to 
acquit itself of responsibility for it cannot be accepted by 
anyone, especially since the occupation forces guard all 
entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque, and consequently, no armed man 
can enter without the approval of those Israeli forces. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: Moreover, we cannot separate the occupation 
soldiers' killing and wounding of a large number of Palestinians 
who were shocked by the crime and took to the streets in the 
cities and villages of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip 
from the timing of the massacre. 
  It says: Killing Palestinians in the occupied territories 
and dealing with them as if they were strangers, and arming 
Jewish settlers and supporting their crimes against Arab 
citizens have become an official policy adopted by the Rabin 
government. This policy has been escalating since the Oslo 
agreement. This shows the Rabin government's hostility to peace 
and stability, and its adherence to Israel's 1948 policy which 
was based on a firm ideology concerning the perpetration of 
massacres and daily killing of Palestinians. This also proves 
that this government has no intention to withdraw from the 
occupied territories or even to stop the establishment of Jewish 
settlements on them. 
  Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH calls on the U.S. 
Administration, the cosponsor of the peace process, to adopt 
fair stands toward what is taking place in the occupied 
territories in harmony with its principles of preventing 
aggression and terrorism. Moreover, all aid to Israel should 
stop, and the principles of the international legitimacy should 
be implemented to achieve peace and stability in the region. 
  In another article on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH calls on 
the international community to immediately and bravely assume 
its responsibilities and to take the necessary measures to 
secure protection for the Palestinians under the Zionist 
occupation by terminating this occupation, especially after this 
crime has proved to the world the extreme danger of the 
continuation of occupation of Arab territories and of settling 
on these territories. This danger can only by eliminated by 
enabling the Palestinian people to determine their future in 
accordance with the UN Charter and resolutions, particularly 
those resolutions on which the peace process is based.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on the barbaric 
massacre perpetrated by Zionist settlers against our kinsfolk at 
the holy Ibrahimi Mosuqe of Hebron. 
  Under the headline "The Fingerprints of Crime and Blood," 
the 
newspaper AL-BA'TH says: In mid-Ramadan and while worshipers 
were prostrating during the dawn prayers at the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque, the Israelis' treacherous bullets killed and wounded 
hundreds of worshipers in a grisly massacre that has dumbfounded 
people everywhere. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: The massacre is a new chapter in the 
Zionists' terrorist record, which is replete with all kinds of 
killings, slayings, and crimes perpetrated over the past 50 
years. 
  The paper holds Israeli rulers responsible for the massacre, 
because it is they who recruited and armed the settlers. 
Moreover, it is they who disarmed the Palestinian Arabs and 
prevented them from carrying even kitchen knives so they can be 
easy prey for these hateful vagabonds. 
  The paper goes on to say: Israeli hands were stained with 
the blood of victims in the massacres committed in Qibyah, Dayr 
Yasin, Bahr al-Baqar, the al-Aqsa Mosque, Sabra, and Shatila, 
and many other places. Now, these criminal hands have been 
stained with worshipers' blood at the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  The paper wonders: Can there be more heinous and dastardly 
criminal murders than those being supported by Israeli rulers, 
who profess to be advocates of peace and civilized conduct, 
while attacking Arabs with weapons and instigating strangers 
whom they brought from the farthest points in the globe? 
Israeli rulers have turned the settlements into safe havens for 
murderers and criminals, who are killing defenseless and 
innocent people in cold blood. 
  AL-BA'TH says: Since the convening of the Madrid conference, 
and throughout all phases of the peace talks, Israeli rulers, 
and the Rabin government in particular, have been adamant in 
their refusal to discuss the issue of settlements, arguing that 
this issue must be discussed only during the final status 
negotiations. 
  The paper wonders: Does this not provide glaring evidence 
that the Israeli rulers are harboring criminal intentions to 
evict the residents of the territories through massacres, 
displacement, eviction, and killings, so there will be nothing 
to negotiate on during the later stage of the negotiations? 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH wonders: What kind of 
peace can be achieved when criminal slayings continue to be 
carried out? What kind of coexistence can there be with these 
killers? For the fingerprints of crime, blood, and shame are 
engraved on their foreheads. Besides, the world community is 
convinced, now more than ever before, that there can be no 
stability, security, or peace in the region unless the Israeli 
occupation is dismantled, and unless the Palestinian Arab people 
regain their right to self- determination. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: The heinous 
massacre perpetrated by Israeli settlers inside the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque confirms for the one thousandth time that Israel 
is a racist hostile entity that flouts all humanitarian and 
ethical values. The reality is that this massacre is the 
epitome of the law of the jungle upheld by the Tel Aviv rulers, 
under the very nose of the world community. They feel immune 
from any punishment. 
  The paper adds: The Yitzhaq Rabin government is responsible 
for this massacre. Blame cannot be placed on an insane settler, 
nor can it be put on an unpremeditated individual act. For had 
it not encouraged and endorsed such a criminal act, the Rabin 
government would not have ordered its troops to kill Arabs who 
took to the streets throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip in the immediate aftermath of the massacre to express 
their sadness and anger. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that the entire world community has 
condemned this heinous crime. Statements and communiques 
condemning this heinous crime and urging measures to prevent a 
recurrence of what has happened have been issued by various 
world capitals. 
  The paper wonders: Are statements enough to deter Israel and 
curb its belligerence, and to return it to its senses? Is the 
use of condemnations and denunciations the proper means of 
dealing with an entity that flaunts its disobedience of 
international legitimacy? 
  AL-THAWRAH urges the world community and the UN Security 
Council to go beyond the issuance of condemnatory and 
denunciatory statements to institute new firm formulas and 
measures to make Israel understand that it cannot remain immune 
from deterrent punitive measures indefinitely. 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: The issue is now 
to be decided by the Security Council. It is hoped that the 
Security Council will pass a clear and unequivocal resolution 
providing for the protection of the Palestinians and disarming 
the settlers, and expressing a determination to see the relevant 
previous Security Council resolutions implemented. Such a 
resolution must also express strong support for the peace 
process, and underscore the removal of Israeli obstacles 
standing in the way of peace efforts. This is because without 
the achievement of just and comprehensive peace that returns 
rights to their lawful owners, the region will remain fertile 
ground for violence, chaos, and terrorism. 
  The newspaper TISHRIN also comments on the same issue, but 
from a different angle. 
  The paper says: It is no coincidence that the occupied 
Syrian Golan settlers council has expressed full support for 
Rabin's policy, which is extending support and backing to the 
settlement drive in the occupied Syrian territories. This stand 
by the settlers council was also prompted by Rabin's frustration 
with the Washington talks, and also by the efforts he has made 
to block a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The paper adds: It is Rabin who armed the settlers, and 
authorized the deployment of joint army-settler patrols. It is 
Rabin who blinded himself to the launching of an army of 
settlers, and to their recent continuous threats to perpetrate 
massacres if the Palestinians fail to quickly vacate their lands 
and abandon their property. 
  The paper goes on to say: Rabin has consecrated settlement 
activities as a constant pillar of his government's policy. The 
Washington peace talks ran into the intransigence of the Israeli 
negotiating teams. Meanwhile, Rabin was expanding settlements 
in the West Bank and the Golan and building new settlements. 
  TISHRIN maintains that peace is the antithesis of settlement 
activities, and that the achievement of peace is contingent upon 
the dismantlement of the settlements and the evacuation of 
settlers. 
  TISHRIN touches on the Washington peace talks, saying that 
they are moving in a vicious circle, because the Israeli 
Government is opposed to withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories. Besides, the paper says, the efforts made by many 
international parties have failed to persuade Israeli rulers 
that peace is far more important than settlement activities and 
territorial expansion. Had Rabin responded favorably to the 
Arab demand for withdrawal from the occupied territories, peace 
would have been close at hand, and the Washington talks would 
have made great progress along the path of achieving just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  However, Rabin, the paper adds, has chosen to lend deaf ears 
to the calls for true and durable peace, and dragged the 
Palestinian negotiators to a flawed and lame agreement that 
consecrates occupation and settlement activities. The end 
result has been the horrifying Friday massacre, which killed 
more than 60 innocent Palestinians, and wounded hundreds of 
others. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: By its perpetration 
of subsequent crimes and its rejection of the requirements of 
just, durable, and permanent peace, Zionism is addressing a 
message to the world community, through this massacre, telling 
it that it has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its racist 
and aggressive colors, and that it will proceed with its 
criminal schemes, even if thousands of innocent victims are to 
fall.

  [Text] Under the headline of "Israel Shoulders the 
Responsibility," TISHRIN says: Within less than two days and 
before the Palestinian blood dries in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
and on the confrontation fields in Gaza and the West Bank, 
Israel committed a new massacre in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in 
Zuq Micha'il in Juniyah, to overshadow the crime of slaughtering 
Palestinian worshipers in Hebron. 
  TISHRIN says it is not strange that Israel tries to hide the 
traces of the dawn crime with another crime also targeting 
worshipers in a church in Juniyah. This was exposed by the 
similar plans of implementation, which threaten the Arabs in 
their homeland, shrines, and even at their prayers. 
  If the Zionist terrorists managed to enter the Ibrahimi 
Mosque and open fire at Palestinian worshipers, their proxy 
instruments played the same role in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in 
Juniyah when they planted explosive devices in disgusting 
timing, because at that time the church is packed with 
worshipers on the occasion of Lent. 
  TISHRIN stresses that the Zionists are masters in 
desecrating 
shrines and committing blatant aggressions against these 
shrines. In this, they do not differentiate between a church and 
a mosque. Their objective is to kill more Arabs. 
  Following the Hebron massacre, it seems that the Israelis 
were afraid of the overwhelming popular anger in the occupied 
Arab territories, and were affected by the broad Arab and 
international condemnation, so they tried through their new 
heinous crime in Sayyidat al-Najat Church to overshadow the 
denunciation and anger at Israel and Rabin's government caused 
by the Hebron crime. 
  TISHRIN adds: Israel, which thought that by committing the 
massacre of Sayyidat al-Najat Church it could alleviate the 
effects of the Hebron massacre, is once again deluded. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says that Lebanese blood is not cheap. 
It is Arab blood the same as Palestinian and Syrian blood. 
Israel should not be allowed to continue with its crimes and 
massacres before the eyes of the entire world. It should not be 
allowed to undermine the will of the international community and 
the resolutions of international legitimacy, adhere to its 
occupation of the Arab territories, and reject the just and 
comprehensive peace. It is impossible to remain silent toward 
Israel's terrorist practices. Israel should be deterred and 
stopped, and this is an international responsibility as much as 
it is an Arab responsibility.

  [Text] In a commentary headlined "Denunciation Alone 
Insufficient," AL-BA'TH says: It is indeed strange that Israel 
should be talking about the enemies of peace, when, in reality, 
it is its enemy number one, if not the only one. 
  In a bid to explain away the savagery perpetrated at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, Rabin contends that it is the enemies of peace 
who stand to benefit from the massacre. He chooses to forget 
that those with Arab blood on their hands are the ones who have 
been hampering every effort to advance the peace process since 
the Madrid conference. 
  Rabin, who is shedding tears over peace, himself leads the 
opposition to disarming the settlers. This means that he 
condones their atrocities and even wants them to continue. The 
massacre that has sent shockwaves throughout the world has 
prompted the Arabs to suspend their participation in the 
bilateral talks. Not that they are thus terminating the peace 
efforts; they are, in effect, telling the sponsors of the peace 
process to wake up to their responsibilities. The first of 
these is to curb Zionist terror in the occupied Arab territories 
and south Lebanon, and then to persuade the Rabin government to 
relinquish its intransigent posture and embark on serious 
negotiations based on a real and clear commitment to vacating 
the entire occupied Arab territories in compliance with UN 
resolutions.

  [Text] Damascus -- The al-Yarmuk Camp witnessed a mammoth 
popular demonstration today in which thousands of Palestinians 
protested the hideous crime perpetrated by the Israeli 
occupation authorities in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque Friday 
morning in which dozens of people were martyred and hundreds 
more were wounded. 
  The march, which was staged along the camp's main roads, was 
led by 'Isam al-Qadi, member of the National Command of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party and secretary general of the Organization 
of the Vanguards of the Popular Liberation War-al-Sa'iqah 
Forces; members of the Regional Command of the Palestinian 
Organization of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party; the secretary of 
Fatah-the Uprising; and the secretary generals of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Palestinian 
Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad Movement, the 
Palestine Liberation Movement, and the Palestinian Popular 
Struggle Front. The march was also led by the secretaries and 
members of the branches of al-Yarmuk, Palestine, and the 
Palestinian Liberation Front of the Ba'th Party; the 
representative of the Hamas Movement; the representative of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine; and 
representatives of the National Progressives Front parties in 
Syria. Palestinian flags, slogans condemning the ugly crime 
perpetrated by the Zionist settlers in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, 
and black banners were raised in the march. The marchers set 
Israeli flags on fire, cheered on the popular intifadah in the 
occupied territories, and called for revenge for the blood of 
the righteous martyrs. 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad 
Movement, addressed the gathering in the main square of the 
al-Yarmuk Camp on behalf of the national Palestinian alliance 
forces in Syria. He reviewed the massacres perpetrated by 
Israel against our Palestinian people in Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Kafr 
Qasim, Nahhalin, 'Ayun Kara, al-Aqsa, and the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque. He said: We will neither surrender nor bargain. The 
banners of our struggle will remain high, and the sacred blood 
that was shed on the holy day in the holy place from the bodies 
of hundreds of the sons of brave Hebron and throughout the 
homeland will water the trees of the intifadah, freedom, and 
victory. 
  Dr. al-Shaqaqi said: This crime is a continuation of the 
liquidation plot embodied in the Gaza-Jericho accord and the 
subsequent accords that are aimed to disarm our people so that 
they will remain defenseless in front of the Israeli Army and 
settlers. 
  Concluding his speech, Dr. al-Shaqaqi stressed the need for 
achieving effective national unity to confront Israeli 
challenges.

Department of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq (SAIRI); date not given] 
  [Text] 
  Once again, the Israeli Zionists have committed a bloody 
massacre, carried out this time in the sacred al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque. Hundreds of Palestinian faithful were victims of this 
massacre while praying at dawn on Friday last week during the 
month of Ramadan. This crime is a manifestation of the constant 
violations the Muslim Palestinian people are being subjected to. 
It also brings to mind the Dayr Yasin massacre and other 
methods of killing and oppressing Palestinians, which reveal 
Israel's true morality. 
  This crime, which has shaken humanity's conscience, is a 
warning to the Palestinian people not to feel at ease with their 
enemies, not to give in to the imposed existing reality, and to 
continue their struggle until victory. This horrible crime 
exemplifies the inability of the Israeli enemy to stop the 
intifadah. It also shows that the Israeli enemy is upset about 
the heroism and steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the 
stone-throwing generation, and wants to take revenge for the 
Muslims' persistence in bearing sacrifices in order to maintain 
the state of jihad and reject capitulation as 'Arafat and his 
followers are doing. 
  The Israeli entity is fully responsible for this crime. 
Those who protect this entity, including the forces of 
arrogance, are also jointly responsible because they continue to 
support this entity fully. The Muslim nations and peoples must 
shoulder their responsibilities toward what the Palestinians are 
being subjected to, such as humiliation and aggression, by 
putting pressure on those with decision-making influence, 
providing moral and material support for the Palestinian 
people's jihad, demanding protection for the Palestinian 
civilians through any means, and boosting morale in the Islamic 
world to continue Muslim resistance to the status quo policy 
which forces them to accept the legitimacy of the usurping 
entity in Palestine. 
  The Iraqi people, who are also being subjected to the policy 
of extreme oppression by Saddam's murderous regime, share the 
sorrows of their brothers in Palestine over this tragedy. The 
belief in sacrifice is the correct course for regaining one's 
rights. The Iraqi people also believe that the foolishness of 
Saddam Husayn and his regime in Iraq are in part responsible for 
the current disintegration and weakness of the Islamic 
countries' stands and duties toward the holy cause in Palestine. 
  We extend our condolences to all the aggrieved families and 
share the sorrows of the struggling Muslim Palestinian people. 
We believe that the souls of the innocent victims and the blood 
of the wounded in the sacred al-Ibrahimi Mosque will be the fuel 
that will feed the flames of the Palestinian intifadah and 
revolution and consume the Israeli designs. We call on God the 
Almighty to take the hand of the Muslims, lead them to their 
dignified status, and make them triumph over their enemies.

<F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: Salim Salih: Some Yemeni </F>
Forces Support Military Option; Experience Taught Us Signing 
Does Not Mean Anything"] 
  [Text] Abu Dhabi -- Salim Salih Muhammad, assistant 
secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and member 
of the Yemeni Presidential Council, has cast doubt on the 
possibilities of implementing the Yemeni Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in Amman last Sunday. And he warned of the 
threat of civil war. 
  The Yemeni official said at a press conference in Abu Dhabi 
following his meeting with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], that "the document 
will not see the light of day in practice except in the areas 
which fall under YSP influence." He also said that Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will not go to Sanaa except after 
the implementation of the document begins. 
  The Yemeni Presidential Council member -- who visited the 
UAE 
in the framework of a tour designed to explain the horizons of 
the Yemeni crisis after the signing of the Pledge and Accord 
Document -- added that "there are those who are helping to 
bolster military action and military option tendencies and to 
turn the tables on all parties." He praised Shaykh Zayid 
Bin-Sultan's understanding of conditions in Yemen. He said that 
"without securing a new mechanism to implement this document, it 
will remain in the drawer." He broached the experiment of the 
past four years, saying that "it has caused us to believe that 
signing is not the important step, but, rather, implementation 
and starting implementation." 
  He described the incidents which have occurred over the past 
two days in Abyan Governorate as "designed to torpedo the Yemeni 
people's prospects after the signing of the document." He said 
that "the document is not a medical prescription to remedy the 
Yemeni crisis. The crisis needs mutual and united efforts from 
all political parties and from all sincere people who want to 
spare Yemen a civil war and the road of violence, terrorism, and 
fragmentation." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad stressed that "'Ali Salim al-Bid, YSP 
secretary general and vice president, will not go to Sanaa under 
the present security situation unless this situation is resolved 
and armed troops are withdrawn from the cities and unless 
credibility regarding what has been agreed upon is proved." 
  Asked whether that means that the document is merely ink on 
paper, the Yemeni official said: "It will be so if it remains 
in the drawer, if the situation remains as it stands, and if the 
Armed Forces and security forces continue to detonate the 
situation here and there." 
  He stressed that the document "will not see the light of day 
in practice except in the areas which fall under YSP influence." 
  Asked about the benefit of signing the document when the 
disputes are still there, Salim Salih said that "the signing is 
binding on all parties, and it exposes any parties that refuse 
to implement the document. At then the people will know who 
does not want to implement it." 
  He added: "It is clear that there are those who are helping 
to bolster the military action and military option tendencies. 
They want to turn the table on all the parties. This is what 
we want the brothers, friends, and the Yemeni people to be aware 
of." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad accused "some military commanders and 
other forces of supporting this tendency." He said that "the 
testimonies of those arrested pointed to the existence of these 
forces, which help, support, and sometimes embrace elements 
which have returned from Afghanistan and elements accused of 
carrying out bombing operations and assassinations and recently 
abducting three Chinese engineers." 
  On the nature of the disagreements which emerged in Amman 
after the signing of the document and prevented the return of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
to Sanaa, accompanied by King Husayn of Jordan, Salim Salih 
Muhammad pointed out that "what was agreed upon in Amman is only 
what is mentioned in the published document. However, there 
were some issues which needed to be discussed. But regrettably, 
the brothers in some parties, including the General People's 
Congress and the Reform Grouping, did not give us the 
opportunity to do so." He added that the YSP submitted a 
working paper about what should be done after the signing, "but 
they refused even to read it." 
  Salim Salih Muhammad urged all parties on the Yemeni scene 
to 
take account of current changes and to work together to spare 
the Yemeni people the threat of civil war and fragmentation, 
secure whatever guarantees stability and development, and 
implement the various political, economic, and social plans. 
  He stressed that the YSP leadership is working to bolster 
Yemeni unity; it is not seeking separation. However, he warned 
that "unless matters are resolved fairly and rights are returned 
to their claimants, and unless local government is implemented, 
powers allocated, and a clear relationship between Sanaa and the 
other governorates and regions secured, we will find ourselves 
in a different position. What we fear is for Yemen to turn into 
more than one part, not just north and south, as was the 
situation in the past. Because changes have imposed on us new 
realities in relations and in understanding people." 
  On his visit to Kuwait -- the first by a Yemeni official 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 -- Salim 
Salih described this visit as "a good start in the framework of 
establishing normal relations between the two countries." He 
also said that "for our part, we presented our view to normalize 
relations between the two countries." 
  He expressed his hope that Kuwait will transcend the deep 
wound with regard to Yemen's official positions during the Gulf 
war. he said, "we as brothers should transcend the past and 
look to the future." 
  He stressed that current conditions in the region, including 
the efforts to secure a solution to the Palestinian issue and 
the Arab-Israeli conflict, require the achievement of a degree 
of Arab solidarity. He expected Kuwait to embark in the period 
ahead on steps toward normalizing its relations with a number of 
states. He described the results of 'Ali Salim al-Bid's visits 
to Egypt and Syria as good, saying they have achieved their 
results at all levels.

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Nawar 25 [25 February], Jamahirya News 
Agency -- The leader of the revolution [Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] 
made the following statement to JANA: The act committed at 
al-Harim al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the morning of the mid holy month 
of Ramadan is a horrific terrorist crime. It is one of the 
dirtiest crimes of terrorism and the most vile crimes of war. 
It is premeditated official terrorism being managed by the 
Israeli Government, a policy on which she sat up her entity 
since its establishment under the protection of the West and 
cover up provided by the Western forces supporting her terrorist 
policy which is founded on massacres. Although what happened 
represents the ugliest act of terrorism ever seen in the world 
and an act of blatant and gross terrorism but we challenge the 
West to declare this reality and admit that the act carried out 
by the Israelis is a pre planned act of official terrorism and 
part of a long chain of Israeli terrorist act and to condemn the 
Israelis for their terrorism. 
  The West, who put the names of the Palestinian people's 
freedom fighters on the black list, are supplying the Israeli 
terrorist with arms, nuclear weapons and F-15 and F-16 war 
planes. 
  It is the West who are supporting Israeli terrorism and 
sponsor it while they treat Palestinian freedom fighters as 
criminals despite the fact that they are fighting for the most 
sacred humanitarian cause in modern times. We believe that if 
there was a real security council other than the one dominated 
by the Christians and there was a real united nations other than 
dominated by the Christians we would have seen anyone who 
supported the Israeli terrorism and support it with weapons, 
nuclear weapons and other supplies put on the black list and 
subjected to air, naval and land embargo and be punished harshly 
for being a patrner in terrorism and supplying the Israeli 
terrorist camp with weapons. We challenge the international 
community if there is one to fulfill their humanitarian and 
required duty to assert justice. And after what the world has 
seen this morning is there anyone who can claim that 'Abu Nidal 
and Ahmad Jibril. [sentence as received; Tripoli JANA in Arabic 
at 1710 GMT on 25 February carried a heavily garbled version of 
this report. In the Arabic version, this sentence reads: "And 
after what the world has seen this morning is there anyone who 
can claim that 'Abu Nidal and Ahmad Jibril are terrorists?"] 
After their terrorism and the premeditated and organized 
official terrorism which may ensue by the Israeli entity, there 
is no terrorist state in the world like the Israeli entity and 
there is no state sponsoring terrorism in the world like those 
states which sponser Israel and supply her with weapons and 
forge with her strategic alliance. [sentence as received] 
  'Abu Nidal, Ahmad Jibril and other fighters of the 
Palestinian people are angels if compared with the Israeli 
savages for the Palestinians have never committed horrific 
cirmes like those committed by the Israelis against innocent 
worshippers in this holy month. The Palestinian fighters are 
fighting in defence of their land occupied by the Israeli 
invaders and usurpers who came to it from overseas to commit 
this atrocities which shock human conscious. What is happening 
nowadays confirm the credibility of our view point regarding 
this issue and prove the correctness of our dicta which we have 
repeatedly asserted.

  [Excerpt] At today's session of the judicial authorities, 
which was chaired by Ayatollah Yazdi, the head of the judiciary, 
Mr. Yazdi condemned the Zionists' savage attack at the Friday 
prayers services in al-Khalil. He said: The negligence of the 
advocates of human rights and international organizations, 
including the United Nations, in such cases, and the lack of 
prompt practical deterrent measures cause public opinion to 
doubt the sincerity of those organizations. 
  He added: This situation is such that there is a need to 
form 
a powerful international criminal court, higher than The Hague 
Court of Justice -- to realize rights, carry out justice, and 
punish offenders. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to unidentified </F>
correpondents, followed by questions and answers, in Algiers on 
28 February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] The brother president, Abu Ammar [Yasir 
'Arafat], was received this afternoon by His Excellency Algerian 
President Liamine Zeroual at the palace of the republic. The 
meeting was attended on the Algerian side by Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri; Mr. Ahmed Ouyahia, secretary of state for 
Maghreb affairs; Mr. Hedi Messaoudi, head of the Arab Affairs 
Department at the Foreign Ministry. It was attended on the 
Palestinian side by brothers Nabil Sha'th, Nasr Yusuf, and Hakam 
Bal'awi, members of the Fatah Central Committee; and the 
ambassador of the State of Palestine in Algiers. 
  After his meeting with His Excellency Algerian President 
Liamine Zeroual, the brother President Abu Ammar made the 
following statement to reporters: 
  ['Arafat] I put the president in the picture about the great 
conspiracy that took place in the form of the hideous massacre 
of our worshippers who were performing the dawn prayers inside 
the holy al-Ibrahim mosque and also about the collusion and the 
conspiracy in which elements of the Israeli Army and armed 
settlers were involved. 
  This reminds us exactly of what happened between the French 
Secret Army Organization and the Algerian settlers, as if 
history were repeating itself in both Algeria and in Palestine. 
I asked the president for Algeria's support in the Security 
Council and in international circles in order to confront this 
hideous conspiracy, which is an attempt to obstruct the peace 
process and the Israeli withdrawal from our land and our homes. 
  It is obvious that this conspiracy had many objectives. It 
aimed at undermining the safety of the Palestinian national. 
Hence, our insistence at the Security Council on rapid 
international protection for the Palestinian people, for our 
children, our women, and our Islamic and Christian holy places. 
I would like to remind everyone that this is the second 
massacre inside our holy places. Let me remind you of the 
massacre which occurred inside al-Aqsa mosque in holy Jerusalem 
some time ago, and now this massacre in al-Ibrahim mosque in 
Hebron, in addition to other Islamic and Christian holy places. 
  Therefore we asked at the Security Council--we insist on 
it--for an international commission to investigate the crime and 
for the dispatch of international troops to protect our people 
from these conspiracies in which elements and units of the 
Israeli Army are involved with armed settlers. This has now 
become of paramount importance. 
  I also put the president in the picture about the atmosphere 
which is ablaze inside our occupied land. There is a sweeping 
revolution and there are continuous clashes between us and the 
Israeli Army and also between us and Israeli settlers. It is 
noticeable, as is clear on all TV networks, that the patrols 
walking the streets are from the Israeli Army and Israeli 
settlers. On this very point, I would like to make clear that 
the Israeli cabinet meeting produced only empty words, and it 
would be appropriate to quote the saying, what a great to-do 
with precious little to show for it. It was nothing more than 
that. 
  Therefore, I call on the world community, the Russian and 
U.S. peace conference co-sponsors, the European Union and all of 
the European states, the nonaligned states, the Islamic states, 
and the Arab countries to assume their responsibility to protect 
the Palestinian people and to force the Israeli Government to 
withdraw immediately from our Palestinian territories, starting 
with Gaza and Jericho and followed by the remainder of our 
occupied territories so that we can effectively establish our 
independent Palestinian state with holy Jerusalem as its 
capital. God willing, this will happen soon. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, what is the fate of peace 
after this massacre? 
  ['Arafat] Undoubtedly it should be clear, and I am 
addressing 
this talk to the whole world and the Russian and U.S. peace 
conference co-sponsors, that peace is blowing in the wind. It 
is clear that the Israeli side has no intention to be committed 
to what they have signed, and there is an attempt to evade the 
deadlines and the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Correspondent] What are the decisions made yesterday after 
the meeting... ['Arafat, interrupting] In fact, we still 
are [pauses]... I have come only to brief the president and go 
back to continue the meeting today because the matter is serious 
and we are discussing all of its aspects. 
  [Correspondent] What is your stance, especially after the 
withdrawal of some countries from the peace talks, Syria and 
Lebanon, for example? 
  [Unidentified person to 'Arafat] Syria and Lebanon announced 
the withdrawal of their delegations from Washington today. 
  ['Arafat] It is the same story, I have withdrawn all of the 
delegations, not only from Washington--my brother Nabil Sha'th 
from Taba, and Cairo and from Paris. We are convening all of 
the delegations, and I am going back [not further clarified] 
because all of the delegations are meeting now. That is to say, 
yesterday and today I have been meeting my brother heads of 
delegations to Washington, Taba, Paris, and Cairo to look into 
all details of this situation in the light of the developments 
and this massacre which is not only a massacre: It is a massacre 
and a conspiracy, an organized operation exactly like you have 
experienced in Algeria between the Secret Army Organization and 
the French settlers.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's </F>
adviser, by Amnon Levi -- live] 
  [Text] [Levi] Good evening to you Dr. al-Tibi, 'Arafat's 
adviser. A commission of inquiry headed by the Supreme Court's 
president and with the participation of an Arab judge -- do you 
still think this is a meaningless decision, as 'Arafat termed it? 
  [Al-Tibi] The decision to set up a state commission of 
inquiry is an internal Israeli Government's decision for the 
investigation of the incidents. Incidentally, the letter of 
appointment refers to checking the facts and circumstances, but 
somehow it was forgotten to authorize the commission to 
investigate the responsible elements: Was it Barukh Goldstein 
only or was it a whole movement, or a settlement, or the 
commander of the Central Command or his superiors? 
  [Levi] It is clearly to be expected though that a commission 
chaired by the Supreme Court president will not restrict itself 
and will act as it finds appropriate. Let me ask you: We have 
just heard a very firm speech by the prime minister in the 
Knesset. In fact, I cannot recall a more resolute speech by him 
against a sector of the Jewish population. A commission of 
inquiry on the highest possible level was established. What 
else do you demand? 
  [Al-Tibi] I cannot recall such a horrendous massacre which 
was committed by an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officer who is a 
Qiryat Arba' settler. In the past, on 16 October 1993, the 
Palestinians -- the Supreme Muslim Council in fact -- in a 
letter to the prime minister and defense minister, warned that 
this person, Barukh [here al-Tibi shows a copy of the letter 
which clearly contained the name Barukh] engaged in provocations 
against Palestinians inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. A 
reminder to this letter was also sent, but there was no 
response. Talk is not of Barukh Goldstein only.... 
  [Levi, interrupting] I assume that this very interesting 
letter which you mention will reach the inquiry commission when 
its starts its work. I assume you will pass it on. Still, 
despite the terrible dimensions of the massacre, let us talk of 
the peace process which is more important than the massacre. 
What conditions, if at all, will bring you back to the 
negotiations? 
  [Al-Tibi] Prior to the cabinet meeting yesterday, the PLO 
had relayed to the Israeli Government six points which it thinks 
the government should have adopted in view of this new era. 
After all, the massacre has changed circumstances and 
conditions. It was proven that Qiryat Arba' and settlement in 
the heart of the Palestinian population are time bombs which 
should be handled, since this is not the first massacre either. 
Qiryat Arba' is responsible for another massacre, in the 
Islamic college, and for daily provocation, by the same people, 
not necessarily only Kakh members. The Palestinians do not 
protest only against Kakh -- is Rabbi Levinger a Kakh member? 
One of the Bet El rabbis, for instance, said that their 
beautiful wives light candles while the men set locals alight, 
and this was not forgotten. Therefore, it is necessary to 
handle the principle of settlers and settlements in the heart of 
Palestinian population. The Israeli Government completely 
failed to do that. 
  [Levi] You are familiar with details of the negotiations 
than me, and you know that your demands, such as the removal of 
Jewish settlements from Gaza and disarming settlers, are not 
realistic. The impression is that you are taking political 
advantage of these murders. Furthermore, when Israelis were 
murdered recently -- since the peace process began, in fact -- a 
demand was repeatedly heard in Israel to discontinue the 
process. Prime Minister Rabin rose and stated each time, shortly 
after each murder: We will not stop the process because it 
would be a victory for the murderers. It seems that in your 
action today you are awarding the murderer. 
  [Al-Tibi] The murder of the pregnant woman last week, for 
example, was a base and despicable murder which disgusted me 
personally. Still, reference here is not to an ordinary murder. 
It was a horrendous, unprecedented massacre. New circumstances 
were created by this massacre. The Palestinian residents in the 
territories are defenseless and should be protected. The IDF 
failed in its task. Due to this and other facts....[pauses] The 
agreement of principles stipulates the need for an international 
presence [last two words in English] -- this is the reason and 
the basis for the demand for international protection, on top of 
the IDF's failure. I heard ministers in the Israeli Government 
who demanded during the cabinet meeting that Jewish 
neighborhoods be removed from the heart of Hebron, and this is 
one of the necessary actions. 
  [Later in the broadcast, Levi cites a reaction by security 
elements to the letter presented by Dr. al-Tibi during his 
interview, saying "this letter does not at all concern Dr. 
Barukh Goldstein, but Barukh Marzel, one of the Kakh leaders."]

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to the Knesset </F>
plenum on the 25 February massacre in Hebron -- live] 
  [Text] Your Excellency, President of the State of Israel; 
Mr. Speaker of the House; distinguished Knesset: 
  This House has seen hard times as well as glorious days. 
This House has witnessed the birth pangs of the State of 
Israel, its struggle for survival, its dreams of peace. In my 
capacity as defense minister and prime minister, I have stood on 
this podium dozens of times. At times I imparted bitter news, 
and on occasion I announced good tidings. Today I stand before 
you, members of the Knesset, and before the citizens of the 
State of Israel and the entire world, and as a Jew, as an 
Israeli, and as a human being, I feel shamed and disgraced by 
the infamy wrought upon us by a base murderer. 
  Members of the Knesset, perhaps more than any other people 
and nation in the world today, Israel has been waging a bloody 
fight for its survival for more than a generation. We have been 
hit by Arab terror, which continues to strike us. From time to 
time, too frequently, we bury our dead, grit our teeth, and go 
on. We fight, lose our best friends -- both civilians and 
soldiers, cherish the memory of the victims, and go on. 
Throughout this long time, we have tried to maintain our image 
as the nation that imparted moral and cultural values to the 
world. It is not easy for a country engaged in an endless war 
to maintain its human image and moral standing. Although we 
have experienced anomalies and tragedies, we have earned our 
good reputation with blood, with the blood of the members of the 
prestate underground organizations, with the blood of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldiers who lost their lives when a 
woman hid a terrorist behind her back as she breast-fed her baby 
and when enemy soldiers raised their arms in surrender while 
concealing a hand grenade that was about to explode. 
  We fight, and when there is no other choice, we kill those 
who come to kill us. We are not murderers. 
  This is the time and place to extend our gratitude to 
thousands of IDF soldiers, to the Shin Bet, to the Israel Police 
and Border Police personnel, whose hard work is the insurance 
policy of the State of Israel. Thank you, from the bottom of 
our hearts. 
  Members of the Knesset, early on the morning of Friday, 25 
February, a tragedy befell the families of the murdered victims, 
the residents of Hebron, the Palestinians, the State of Israel, 
and the Jewish people. In the city where the father of both 
Israel and Ishmael lived -- the city that experienced 
coexistence, as well as the abhorrent pogrom against the Jews -- 
in Hebron, a Jew desecrated the holiness of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs. At a time when hundreds of Muslim worshipers were 
praying to their God in the middle of the Ramadan fast, a 
villainous Jew opened fire, killing dozens of Muslim worshipers 
and wounding dozens more. To date, we do not know the exact 
number of dead and wounded. We know this much, however: This 
is a great tragedy, a terrible disaster. 
  The Israeli Government, and I believe and hope the entire 
Knesset, sends its condolences to the families whose dear ones 
were killed in cold blood and wishes a speedy recovery to the 
wounded. 
  Members of the Knesset, even before the cabinet decided to 
set up a state commission of inquiry, we began our own 
investigations, which are still under way. We are leaving no 
stone unturned in our search for the truth. Nevertheless, at 
this point we can already state with almost total certainty the 
following facts: The wicked murderer acted alone, and he had no 
partners in the firing inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. As 
far as we know at this stage, the murderer managed to shoot from 
his rifle alone at least 111 bullets at the innocent worshipers 
who were praying to their God and did not notice the villain 
laying in ambush. 
  I would like to add that 111 cartridges were found and, 
according to the investigation conducted by the Israel Police 
Department of Investigation and Forensic Science, all were fired 
from his rifle. Not a single cartridge fired from a different 
weapon was found. In the riots that broke out in several 
locations in the territories after the massacre, there were 
several instances in which IDF soldiers were forced to fire to 
defend themselves because their lives were endangered. As a 
result of that fire, some residents of the territories were 
killed or wounded. The investigation into that is still going 
on. When it is concluded, we will make all the findings public 
and hide nothing. Any attempt to present IDF soldiers as 
partners to the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs, however, 
is absurd. 
  Could the massacre have been avoided? We are living in a 
difficult situation in which Jews and Arabs live side by side, 
rubbing shoulders daily and hourly. Thousands of Jews and Arabs 
live in one area and mix in hothouses, markets, fields and 
citrus groves, in buses and taxis, in cafes and restaurants, at 
building sites and in factories. Thus Jews and Arabs have been 
praying side by side in the Cave of the Patriarchs, a holy site 
for both religions, since 1967. We -- Arabs and Jews -- have 
been destined to live together in Israel and the territories, 
and there is no possibility of completely preventing lunatics 
from both sides from exploiting that situation in order to carry 
out attacks. The truth must be told, even at this hour. We 
Israelis have suffered far more from terrorist attacks, but we 
are also mindful of the suffering of the Palestinians and of any 
human pain. We feel for all grief. 
  Members of the Knesset, this is a difficult time for the 
citizens of the State of Israel, the Jewish people, and anybody 
in whom a human heart beats. This despicable act is so foreign 
to us, so un-Jewish, so abhorrent, that the quote from the 
Bible, which we gave to all people of cultures everywhere, is 
apt: Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are 
their swords. O my soul, come not into their council; O my 
spirit, be not joined to their company; for in their anger they 
slay men, and in their wantonness they hamstring oxen. Cursed 
be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is 
cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel. 
[Genesis 49:5] 
  Members of the Knesset, the villain from Hebron put a mark 
on 
all of us, even though we are not to blame. That despicable man 
may not have been deranged in the clinical sense of the term 
when he pulled the murderous trigger, but the ghastly act was 
that of a mentally ill person, and in our hearts we feel only 
deep contempt for his vile deed. That murderer surfaced from 
within a small, limited political framework. He grew up in a 
morass whose sources exist here and overseas. They are foreign 
to Judaism; they do not belong to us. To him and those like 
him, we say today: You are not part of the people of Israel; 
you are not part of the national democratic camp in which all in 
this House are partners. Many among us despise you. You are 
not partners to the Zionist effort. You are an alien element; 
you are wild weeds. Sane Judaism vomits you out from its midst. 
You have alienated yourselves from the community, according to 
the Halakah. You are a shame to Zionism and a disgrace to 
Judaism. One direct line links all the lunatics and racists of 
the world, a single line of blood and terror from the Islamic 
Jihad that shot at Jewish worshipers at prayer in synagogues in 
Istanbul, Paris, and Amsterdam and including the Jewish Hamas 
member who shot at Ramadan worshipers. 
  Yesterday the government made the following decision: 
  a. In view of the extraordinary circumstances and under the 
Commission of Inquiry Law, 1968, it was decided to set up a 
commission of inquiry into the massacre at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs on 25 February 1994; 
  b. After hearing a report by the security services and after 
being presented the attorney general's opinion, the government 
decided on a series of individual measures against extremists 
among the Israeli residents of Judaea and Samaria, as follows: 
  1. Carrying out administrative detentions; 
  2. Imposing restrictive and supervisory orders governing 
the entry of certain people to Judaea and Samaria and to Hebron; 
and 
  3. Revoking gun permits for certain people and disarming 
them; 
  c. Tasking the attorney general with investigating the 
possibility of outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay; 
  d. Registering the statement by the prime minister and 
defense minister on the release of some 800 Palestinian 
prisoners and detainees, with the aim of reaching the release of 
up to 1,000 detainees and prisoners within the coming week; 
  e. Reopening the Cave of the Patriarchs after determining 
new security and prayer arrangements. 
  Members of the Knesset, we are proud of our democracy; there 
are few like it in the world. Each citizen of Israel has the 
right to express his opinion in a democratic manner, to oppose 
or support government policy. There are those who claim that 
the democratic system is weak in the face of other systems of 
government in the world. I say to you that even the weakest 
democracy must defend itself and its values, and that we will 
do. We will not permit anybody in the State of Israel or the 
territories under its control, regardless of his name or 
position, to determine or change the policy of the government -- 
any government -- by trying to extort at gunpoint or through 
false messianic claims. No political movement or power group -- 
secular or religious -- will dare to raise its hand against 
democracy here. We, as a government, will stand like a 
fortified wall and without mercy, and we will use all legal 
measures, even if force is required, to quash any such attempt 
in the bud. 
  Members of the Knesset, we know today that the murderer from 
Hebron fired at innocent people but planned to kill the peace. 
His aim was political. To all those who still have doubts 
about the State of Israel's commitment to peace, I say with a 
clear voice: Do not be mistaken. We will continue to work for 
peace on the basis of the Declaration of Principles, signed in 
Washington, and the Cairo document. We will accelerate the 
talks, the contacts, and the negotiations. Even if it tarries, 
peace will come. Nevertheless, I must make clear to our 
Palestinian partners at the negotiating table: The vile murder 
in Hebron and the mourning and grief will not move us from our 
positions of principle regarding Israel's security and the 
security of its citizens, including the Jewish settlers in 
Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. We have no intention of 
compromising, even one iota, on security matters which affect 
each one of us. Our security is also your security and the 
supreme guarantee of the success of peace. I will tell you 
today: No knife, no firebomb, no stone will deter us from 
upholding our principles concerning security while continuing to 
hound the perpetrators of terror. We will not let them rest. 
  I wish to say something else to the Palestinians, our 
partners at the negotiating table in Taba, Paris, Cairo, and 
Washington: We understand you and grieve with you over the 
terrible tragedy. We identify with the deep grief, sorrow, and 
the tears, and we know that even when peace comes, both of us 
will lick the wounds from the wars. We invite you to return to 
the negotiations table, to resume the talks. We will return to 
continue the negotiations because after the blood and tears, the 
near future may bring what we have sought and dreamed of for so 
long: to put an end to 100 years of war and terrorism and to 
start to live like all other nations. We are close to the 
target in the next stage of the peace negotiations. We see the 
finishing line. More effort, more readiness, more goodwill by 
you Palestinians and by us, and we will succeed. We will bring 
peace to our homes and our children. We have no other way -- 
only peace, and nothing but peace. 
  I want to make several remarks to the Israeli Arabs. For a 
generation, you have been part of us for good and for bad. You 
were with us for dozens of years during hard times for you and 
us, and despite all the difficulties, you have been loyal 
partners. We managed to achieve coexistence, and we want it to 
continue. We understand your grieving hearts at this hour, but 
we believe that we must not let momentary crises affect the 
glorious times that we can expect. We will not permit difficult 
crises, no matter how many there are, to destroy the fabric of 
relations we have built over dozens of years. 
  Members of the Knesset, in my worst dreams I did not believe 
that I would stand here today in front of you under such 
difficult circumstances. I would like to hope and believe that 
this nightmare will pass, but not before all of us on both sides 
of the border understand that there is hope for a solution to 
this unending bloodbath, and it is peace. I believe and hope 
that this house is united in denouncing the crime and in 
expressing condolences, just as it is united in the aspiration 
for peace, even if there are differences of opinion between us 
on how to achieve it. 
  I will conclude with the words of the Hebrew poet Bialik: 
How great the pain, and how great the shame, and what is the 
greater of the two? Man, you tell me.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Progressive Socialist Party; date </F>
not given] 
  [Text] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, a flagrant massacre, 
is a message to Arabs and Muslims and a new mark of shame on the 
forehead of Zionism, which has been absolved by international 
public opinion through the United Nations of the accusation of 
racism. Therefore, we ask the Zionists what they would describe 
as their law and regulations, considering what happened in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque today, when a Zionist opened fire on a group of 
worshipers praying piously to God. In moments, they were 
transferred into martyrs in the name of God. The ground of the 
Mosque was turned into a lake of the blood of scores of martyrs 
and hundreds of wounded, within sight of the army which was 
guarding the place and keeping the peace. Tomorrow, they will 
claim that a demented person committed the crime or that it is a 
revenge operation. They will pretend to condemn and denounce it. 
  The PSP [Progressive Socialist Party] has sent a cable to 
the 
United Nations, the Socialist International, the Arab League, 
and all other international organizations condemning this ugly 
crime and demanding that a stance be taken regarding it. It 
would like to make the following remarks: 
  1. This crime committed by a Zionist settler is not an 
individual act. It represents a racist and extremist way of 
thinking and behaving opposed to everything that is Arab. This 
proves the racist nature of the Israeli culture, which they 
teach their children and citizens and present as an example to 
the region under the banner of the future Israeli peace. 
  2. What is the use of reaching agreements with the Israelis 
while Israel presents new evidence daily on its continuing 
policy to terrorize the Arabs in Palestine and kick them out of 
their land? We wonder about the usefulness of the Oslo agreement 
and the subsequent agreements, and about how serious the two 
cosponsors are about securing peace in the Middle East. 
  3. We ask the United States and International Security 
Council in particular about the usefulness of repealing the 
resolution equating Zionism with racism when Israel provides 
daily evidence of its extremist racism and deep-rooted fascism. 
  4. We ask PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat why he is in a hurry to 
skip stages. We ask him whether he is now convinced that 
unilateral solutions are no good for the Palestinian people, 
since they only allow Israeli infiltration into the Arab ranks 
and undermine Arab decisiveness. Such solutions do not 
constitute progress toward a just peace that secures for the 
Palestinian people their simplest rights. 
  5. We affirm to Israel that the blood which flowed at dawn 
today on this Ramadan morning will permeate the Arab spirit and 
teach each Arab that the Zionists are deadly enemies. 
  The masses will avenge you, o martyrs of the mosque, o 
martyrs of Palestine and Arabism.

  [Text] Zuq Mikha'il has bid a last farewell to its victims 
in a mass funeral held at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in that 
town. The holy communion was chaired by Maronite Patriarch Mar 
Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr, assisted by a group of patriarchs and 
priests. President Ilyas al-Hirawi and his wife attended the 
mass. The prime minister was represented by Minister Hagop 
Demerdjian and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri was 
represented by Deputy Rashid al-Khazin. A large number of 
ministers, deputies, and key figures also attended. 
  In his homily, Patriarch Sfayr said: Some say that such 
crimes happen in the best of countries, but this is not 
satisfactory. There they capture the culprits, who then receive 
the punishment they deserve. Here however, the perpetrators 
remain unknown, either due to impotence or willingness to keep 
people in the dark; both amount to the same thing. These two 
reasons do not exempt the state from its responsibility for 
finding the culprits; they do not alleviate the obsessions and 
fears; and they do not insure safety for citizens. The Maronite 
patriarch urged a state that applies right and justice and 
treats all equally. 
  President al-Hirawi said in a speech: I came to this church 
to accept condolences in the name of the whole country, and to 
say that for thousands of years we have been destined to stand 
fast, from Wadi Qannubin to the cedar-clad mountains, to any 
spot in this sacred land. He added: I came to this church to 
say, in front of Your Beatitude, the other priests, and the 
representative of the Pope that we will remain faithful to this 
pledge, standing fast in Lebanon. 
  [(Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon in Arabic at 1010 GMT on 
28 
February adds: "President al-Hirawi said: We will remain 
faithful to the pledge, and the hands that encroach upon Lebanon 
will be cut off. Tendentious people have no place among us. 
When peace began its march, they began their shameful acts."]

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Progressive Socialist Party on 28 </F>
February] 
  [Text] The PSP [Progressive Socialist Party] denounces the 
criminal bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
Mikha'il, condemns the perpetrators, offers its heartfelt 
condolences to the victims' families, and wishes a quick 
recovery for the wounded. It wishes to put the following points 
on record: 
  First, the crime comes in the context of a scheme seeking to 
undermine the process of security and national accord which has 
made great progress with Syrian assistance. It aims to involve 
the country in a new cycle of violence, keep the Lebanese arena 
open to those who wish to exploit it in order to pressure and 
weaken Lebanon, throw Syria's role in Lebanon into confusion, 
and undermine the two countries' relationship. The crime comes 
in the wake of the bombing of the Phalangist Party headquarters 
in al-Sayfi and several other similar operations. A number of 
suspects were arrested after these operations, which proves that 
the same groups are responsible for all these crimes. 
Consequently, we ask the state: What point has the 
investigation into the al-Sayfi bombing reached? Would it not 
have been possible to halt all these assaults on Lebanon and 
these new crimes against the Lebanese people if the Lebanese 
security departments had succeeded in apprehending the al-Sayfi 
culprits? What point has the interrogation of the pro-Israeli 
ring reached? Some of this ring's leaders were uncovered, 
arrested, and accused of planning assassinations of Lebanese 
officials and the bombing of various places. 
  We demand increased focus on these investigations and urge 
that all information that thus comes to light be made public. 
We all urge that the severest penalties, up to execution, be 
inflicted on the suspects. We call for measures to extradite 
Ghassan Tuma, the most prominent fugitive suspect linked to the 
aforementioned operations. 
  Second, the PSP warned earlier of the consequences of having 
several diverse official security agencies that have no 
coordination whatsoever with each other. Indeed, some of their 
actions undermine the efforts seeking to maintain security, 
prevent infiltrations, or uncover criminals, particularly the 
perpetrators of crimes against the state's security. We 
reemphasize our call to reexamine this affair. We urge that 
this be done from the perspective of supreme national interest. 
If it is unavoidable to have all these separate agencies, at 
least let them be placed under a unified command and let matters 
follow their proper course. 
  Third, it is clear that a single political-security 
operations room is making plans, implementing them, and trying 
to exploit the results. In the context of sectarian sedition 
and to cause greater rifts among the Lebanese people, some 
forces are now raising their heads and pretending to be 
concerned about the Christians' welfare and future. These 
forces already stand convicted of formerly involving the 
Christians in strife, causing their displacement from their 
homes, and forcing them to make suicidal choices that have cost 
them and cost Lebanon dearly. They now exploit any political or 
security incident to pressure, intimidate, and incite them, 
heighten their frustration, and then call for self-isolation and 
demand special guarantees. They try to do this just when all 
the Lebanese people are unanimous in their opinion that such 
crimes are directed against them all and against Lebanon's 
national unity and future. 
  Hence, efforts must be made to isolate and excise this 
pro-Israeli tendency from Lebanon's national body and prevent it 
from achieving its aims. 
  Fourth, in such circumstances, just as in our daily life, 
the 
media play a vital role. Some of them are part of the 
above-mentioned operations room and are consequently incapable 
of exercising the necessary self-censorship and halting the 
dangerous sectarian incitements so evident in their news and 
other programs. We urge the state to act promptly and pass a law 
organizing the audiovisual media. This law will lay down 
restrictions and prevent the use of media for such a purpose or 
other purposes that threaten national unity and national and 
social morality.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 28 (AFP)--The head of a former Christian 
militia said Monday [28 February] the Lebanese government was to 
blame for a bomb attack which killed nine worshipers in a church 
north of Beirut, dismissing claims that Israel was responsible. 
  "Even if there is an external plot it is the duty of the 
state to protect its citizens," said Samir Ja'ja' of the 
disbanded Lebanese Forces, at a press conference at his 
fortified home in Ghidras, north of the capital. 
  "The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime," he 
said, referring to Sunday's bomb attack in Our Lady of 
Deliverance Church, in which 55 people were also injured. 
  "The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they 
have realised that the security the authorities promised to 
restore is still a mirage," Ja'ja' added. 
  Information Minister Michel Samahah and several other 
Lebanese officials blamed Israel for the bombing and linked the 
blast to Friday's massacre of 52 Palestinian worshipers in 
Hebron on the West Bank. 
  "By blaming external factions these officials are trying to 
cover up for their own impotence," Ja'ja' said, stressing that 
the authorities had no tangible lead on which to base their 
accusations. 
  Displaced Persons Minister Walid Junblatt said Monday he 
feared a wave of attacks against places of worship in Lebanon by 
supporters of partition backed by Israel. 
  The Druze leader, who heads the Progressive Socialist Party 
(PSP), called for "radical steps against those who undermine our 
security." 
  He rejected claims of a link between the church bombing and 
the Hebron massacre, saying the theory was "unconvincing" and 
Israeli agents were "well known in Lebanon." 
  Prosecutor Tarabay Rahmah said on Sunday that a suspect had 
been arrested in connection with the blast, but he had been 
seized days before it happened. 
  The blast was the second against Christian targets since a 
December bomb attack on the right-wing Phalange Party 
headquarters killed three people and wounded 100. 
  Relatives of the victims held a mass funeral in the church 
on 
Monday. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in 
Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call to his Lebanese counterpart 
Ilyas al-Hirawi late Sunday to help track down the bombers.

  [Text] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stated that 
the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuk is a grave 
development that aims to push Lebanon into very dangerous and 
negative security and political problems. 
  He accused Israel's intelligence service of arranging the 
crime, which was meant to divert attention from the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and involve Lebanon again in the cycle of 
violence. He added that this requires more vigilance, caution, 
and unity to confront such grave challenges. 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ, Fadlallah said: In the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we cannot help but see the ugly 
American face, because the United States has provided Israel 
with every means of protection against international moves to 
condemn it. He said the U.S. President's call to the 
Palestinians and Israelis to move the negotiations to Washington 
is meant to save the Palestinians' face and to insinuate that 
the Palestinians have broken down the Zionist barrier placed by 
Israel between the United States and the Palestinians. This 
gives the impression that the U.S. President's direct 
sponsorship of the negotiations might give the Palestinians the 
unrealistic dream that Washington will pressure the Jews to 
accept what they have rejected in Taba. But the issue is this: 
The United States will exert more pressure on the Palestinians 
by claiming to discuss the need for peace and for opposing the 
extremist Jews. 
  Fadlallah said there should be a Palestinian stance that 
reflects respect for the blood of the Palestinian people and 
there should also be a firm Arab stance mobilizing all the Arab 
factors of strength that will confront this massacre and its 
implications so that the world can know that the Arabs have 
broken the mold of ineffectiveness. 
  On what prompted Clinton to meet Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad, Fadlallah said: It was the feeling that President 
al-Asad has highlighted Syria's Arab role. This success enabled 
him to make the Syrian stance rebel against all the internal and 
foreign factors of weakness. Syria was meant to remain weak in 
the post-Gulf war changes. But the political surprise was 
President al-Asad's success in benefiting from all the Islamic, 
Palestinian, and Arab strengths and exploiting them to highlight 
the Syrian stance. Syria emphasized its strength in its recent 
position and this made the Americans feel that the Syrian role 
was indispensable. This role has remained strong despite all 
the pressures on it. He noted that there was no change in U.S. 
policy after the Geneva conference but a change in tactics. 
  Fadlallah stressed that the resistance will stay if there is 
a limited Israeli withdrawal from the south and might stay even 
if there is a withdrawal from all of the south. He said: I 
believe President al-Asad understands the value of the 
resistance in restoring Arab dignity and in pressuring Israel 
and the U.S. stance. 
  Regarding reports of U.S. fears of possible Israeli 
operations in the south, Fadlallah said: The method of 
discussing fears is the strongest form of threat. 
  He said he does not believe the pope's scheduled visit to 
Lebanon is of any unusual importance. He said: I do not 
believe it will have any important political impact on Lebanon's 
major issue, namely, the Israeli occupation. As we can see, the 
pope's gift to the Lebanese and Arab peoples before his visit 
was the quick recognition of Israel. We do not believe this 
gift encourages the Lebanese to think that this visit will 
greatly benefit their ambitions.

  [Text] While condolences were offered to the church, an 
Islamic-Christian summit was held in Bkirki today. The summit 
included Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah Butrus Sfayr; Shaykh 
Muhammad Rashid Qabbani, acting mufti of the Republic; and 
Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman of the 
Higher Islamic Shiite Council. The latter two visited Bkirki to 
offer condolences to the victims of yesterday's explosion. 
  The heads of the Muslim community informed Patriarch Sfayr 
that Druze spiritual leader Shaykh Bahjat Ghayth will not be 
able to come for health reasons and that they were asked to 
speak on his behalf and extend his condolences. 
  Shaykh Shams-al-Din clarified that a small committee 
consisting of the Islamic-Christian dialogue group has been 
commissioned to hold contacts with officials and urge them to 
take the necessary measures to uncover this crime and its 
criminals. 
  After leaving Bkirki, Shams-al-Din said the target of the 
crime is not the church or the worshipers, but the heart and 
unity of Lebanon and the government's projects. He affirmed 
that the criminal hand is not Lebanese. It is certainly a 
foreign hand. He noted that this crime has not been committed 
against the Maronite community alone, nor against the Muslims 
alone, but against all Lebanese. 
  Shaykh Qabbani said that the fingerprints on the church and 
Hebron Mosque massacres are the same. He called on the Lebanese 
to arm themselves with comprehensive national unity. He 
affirmed that the Lebanese will never be dragged into sectarian 
sedition and that there is no justification for what happened, 
no matter what the reasons. 
  A Hizballah delegation was one of the most prominent 
visitors 
at the Patriarchate today and it took part in the service for 
the victims of the church bomb. A delegation from the National 
Liberal Party also visited Bkirki today to express their 
condemnation and pain over the crime. 
  The Amal Movement condemned the massacre at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church and saw it as an extension of the massacre at 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The General Labor Federation also 
condemned the crime and asked the state to track down the 
criminals and punish them as severely as possible so that they 
would be an example to others.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 27 (AFP)--Lebanon came to a standstill 
and church bells tolled on Monday to mourn the nine Christians 
killed when a bomb ripped through a Maronite church. 
  The head of the Maronite Catholic community, Monsignor 
Nasrallah Sfayr, was to lead their funeral service at the 
devastated Our Lady of Deliverance Church in Zuq Mikha'il, 20 
kilometers (12 miles) north of Beirut. 
  Shops, schools and banks kept their doors shut in the 
capital 
and other towns following Sunday's attack, which came three 
months before a visit by the pope and was the first of its kind 
on a church in Lebanon. 
  State-run and private radio and television stations 
cancelled 
their regular programmes to broadcast classical music to honour 
the dead in the attack just two days after the Hebron massacre. 
  Church bells rang in the southern port city of Tyre, while 
Palestinians in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah refugee camp near Sidon, 
Lebanon's largest, joined in the day of mourning. 
  Businesses and schools closed in Israel's "security zone" 
along the border and the pro-Israeli Voice of the South also 
played classical music. 
  "We have to close down out of respect for the dead. It's the 
least we can do," said the manager of a take-away pizza 
restaurant in Beirut. 
  "God help us. What's going to happen to us next?" said an 
interior designer who still bears the scars of a leg injury 
suffered during Lebanon's civil war of 1975 to 1990. 
  A four-year-old girl was among those killed when a 
five-kilogram (11-pound) bomb attached to two mortar shells and 
a timing device exploded during a Lent mass in Zuq Mikha'il. 
  The church was packed with worshippers. 
  Father Antoine Sfayr who was leading the service was among 
55 
people wounded in the explosion, which rocked the church as he 
began reading from the scriptures. 
  US President Bill Clinton, Jordan's King Husayn and Pope 
John 
Paul II joined in condemnation of the attack. 
  There was no claim of responsibility but an unidentified 
suspect was arrested, prosecutor Tarabayh Rahmah announced late 
Sunday after an emergency meeting of security officials which 
included Syrian officers. 
  The authorities were aware of "a plan to commit attacks in 
places of worship in Lebanon," Rahmah said, noting that the 
suspect was arrested a few days before the blast. 
  Lebanese newspapers, echoing officials here and in Syria, 
pointed an accusing finger at Israel and linked the attack to 
the massacre Friday of 52 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on 
the occupied West Bank. 
  "Israel observed the Sabbath on Saturday and pursued on 
Sunday what it had begun on Friday: blood flowed at the Tomb of 
the Patriarchs in Hebron and in Our Lady of Deliverance Church," 
said the pro-Syrian daily AL-SAFIR. 
  The newspaper charged that the attack was aimed at sowing 
the 
discord between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon. 
  "If no one conquers Israel on its own territory, we must 
conquer Israeli logic, its agents and its plans on our own 
territory," the pro-government AL-NAHAR said in an editorial. 
  Another pro-government daily, AL-LIWA', said the aim of the 
attacks in Hebron and Zuq Mikha'il were to "torpedo the peace 
process," which came to a halt on Sunday as Arab delegates cut 
short negotiations with Israel in Washington. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad of Syria, which has 35,000 troops in 
Lebanon, pledged in a telephone call late Sunday to his Lebanese 
counterpart Ilyas al-Hirawi to help track down the bombers. 
  "Harm done to Lebanon is like harm done to Syria," Asad told 
al-Hirawi.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by Progressive Socialist Party leader </F>
Walid Junblatt on 28 February--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Only earnest and stern measures can deter the 
criminals and eliminate those who play havoc with national 
security. These measures should include the following: 
  1. The results of the investigation into the al-Sayfi 
[Phalangist Party headquarters] bombing must be made public and 
if evidence and suspects are available, they must be tried by a 
military tribunal and executed on the spot. 
  2. The same measures must be applied without hesitation 
against the recently apprehended pro-Israeli gangs. According 
to reports, the Army intelligence service recently uncovered and 
arrested such groups. 
  3. A request must be submitted to the French Government to 
hand over the individuals suspected of attempting to assassinate 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi. According to our information, these 
individuals possess much information and command dangerous 
groups hostile to the country's security. 
  4. The country's various intelligence services must be 
purged of all individuals guilty of corruption, favoritism, 
illegal means of amassing wealth, and negligence. Such people 
must dismissed. All intelligence services must be placed under 
one unified command so that it will be possible to remedy the 
current chaos in these services, as illustrated by the fact that 
escort services for VIP's and their motorcades are more 
important than the citizens' security. 
  5. A media law must be passed, unhindered by democratic 
formalities, with the aim of stopping some television and radio 
stations from broadcasting incitements. These media must be 
deterred and closed down. 
  As for the weepy statements full of political theorizing 
aimed at linking the church massacre with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, they are neither useful nor convincing. 
  While it is true that Israel is the first beneficiary of 
such 
incidents, it also has well-known agents in the country. This 
morbid thing must be excised from the national body before the 
sickness spreads and remedy becomes impossible. Israel, in the 
final reckoning, does not need to cover up its crime. Just 
listen to the still-inciteful statements by the Zionist entity's 
leaders. For example, the so-called man of peace Shim'on Peres 
refuses to disarm the settlers, wagers on Rabin's downfall, and 
represents the Zionist army's and Zionist entity's hardline 
wing. The measures Israel has adopted are limited to the 
temporary arrest of five settlers. 
  The Hebron massacre is the start of a major series of crimes 
aimed at expelling the Palestinians from the West Bank and 
bringing in more Jews from the former Soviet Union and other 
countries. Recently they informed us that one million Indian 
Jews might be brought to Palestine. Hence, the peace 
negotiations, stillborn to begin with, were buried by the Hebron 
crime. 
  We fear that some of the advocates of partition, federalism, 
so-called civilized pluralism, and extensive decentralization in 
Lebanon will return to their schemes, bombing churches today and 
mosques or other places of worship tomorrow with the help of the 
Israelis.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has reaffirmed the League's stance on 
how to properly solve the Libyan-Western dispute over the 
Lockerbie issue through negotiations, mediation, and judicial 
settlement in line with Clause 33 of the UN Charter's Chapter 6. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
explained the circumstances of the crisis, noting that in its 
legal aspect, several countries--the United States, Britain, and 
France--are asking another country, Libya, to hand over two of 
its citizens for trial by the authorities of those countries on 
charges attributed to them. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that in this case the dispute is over 
a well-known phenomenon in international law called "the 
extradition of criminals". He explained that international law 
places certain controls on extradition, including the 
stipulation that handing over criminals is a sovereign matter 
which cannot be imposed on any country. Also, he pointed out, 
there must be a treaty or agreement among the concerned 
countries according to which a country is committed to handing 
over its citizens to the country requesting the extradition. 
  'Abd-al-Majid told MENA that the most recent international 
trend permits a country to refuse to extradite its nationals. 
He pointed out that the eighth UN conference on the prevention 
of crime and the treatment of criminals which was held in Havana 
in August 1991 approved a model draft agreement for the 
extradition of criminals, the fourth article of which stated 
that a country can refuse to extradite an individual who is one 
of its citizens. 
  He added that although the Arab League fully condemns the 
blowing up of the plane in question and the death of innocent 
victims, yet it believes that, from a purely legal perspective, 
the United States, Britain, and France have transferred the 
issue from the legal and judicial sphere to the political 
sphere, something that is contrary to the original character of 
the case. 
  He explained that the U.S. and British judicial systems 
stipulate that in order to extradite criminals there should be 
an extradition treaty between the country requesting the 
extradition and the country which is asked to hand over the 
wanted individuals. Also, these judicial systems require that a 
court verdict be issued permitting an act of extradition. He 
further explained that according to the system applied in 
France, the Libyan Government can legally hand over the wanted 
individuals but on condition of reciprocal treatment. 
  'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that since there is no extradition 
treaty between Libya and the three concerned countries, it is 
difficult to force the Libyan Jamahiriyah to comply. 
  He noted that Libya has condemned international terrorism 
and 
expressed willingness to cooperate in the trial of the suspects 
in a neutral country. Consequently, he said, it might be 
appropriate for those three countries to show responsiveness to 
this Libyan wish and to the good offices that several other 
parties are making to reach a solution that will maintain Libyan 
national sovereignty and be in agreement with Article 33 of the 
UN Charter's which calls for solving disputes among countries by 
peaceful dialogue. 
  'Adnan 'Imran, Arab League assistant secretary general for 
political affairs, announced that the League will continue its 
efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis in a manner that will 
preserve Libya's dignity and sovereignty. 
  He added that the Western countries have exploited the UN 
Security Council for the purpose of issuing resolutions against 
Libya without fear from any party whatsoever. He said he 
believes these resolutions are contrary to the UN Charter and 
represent a dangerous precedent that will undermine the world's 
confidence in the United Nations. 
  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid recently met with Ibrahim 
al-Bishari, Libya's permanent representative at the Arab League, 
and reviewed with him the developments of the crisis, the Arab 
League's role in it, and the possibility of holding a meeting of 
the Arab seven-member committee on the sidelines of the next 
Arab League meeting in March.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Member Mahmud </F>
'Abbas, also identified by his nom de guerre Abu-Mazin, by 
Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khashanah] There are mounting Palestinian calls 
for the suspension of the PLO's participation in the 
negotiations in protest against the Hebron massacre. What are 
the expected repercussions of the massacre for the negotiations 
and the peace process? 
  ['Abbas] What the Israeli settlers have done is a major 
obstacle in the way of the peace process and reflects the wishes 
and views of those settlers who rejected the peace process from 
the beginning out of the belief that it endangers their own 
interests. They see it undermining their beliefs and the 
illusions they entertained for decades about "greater Israel." 
That is why, since the signing of the Declaration of Principles 
agreement and the start of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, 
they have been provoking the Palestinian population and, in 
doing so, taking advantage of the privileges they got from the 
Israeli Government, namely full armament and freedom of movement 
in the West Bank and the Gaza strip while the Palestinians are 
forbidden to carry arms and are faced with curfews and movement 
restrictions. 
  The settlers, enjoying all these freedoms and privileges, of 
course reject the peace process. That hostile action will have 
an impact on the Palestinian people. 
  As a matter of principle, we have to say that there has been 
no crime such as that abominable crime committed by those 
settlers for many years. It (the Hebron massacre) is of the 
same magnitude as the Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and Dayr Yasin 
massacres, and other massacres committed by the Zionist gangs in 
the past, crimes now committed and carried out by the settlers 
militias. 
  We must here hold the Israeli Government responsible because 
it gave the settler these liberties and because it has special 
militias. 
  I do not know why a government which has an army, a police 
force, and security forces needs militias to "protect" those 
settlers. If it believes that their presence is abnormal, why 
keep them where they are? Furthermore, why have settlements 
which have been deemed unnecessary by the United Nations, the 
whole world, and a large number of Israelis? 
  When (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin himself speaks 
of 
political settlements and security settlements, he means to say 
that some of these settlements are unnecessary. We do not 
believe that the solution to this problem is to be found in the 
statements and resolutions of condemnation nor in the messages 
of condolences sent by the Israeli officials. The solution lies 
in effective measures to disarm the settlers and reassess many 
settlements which present daily provocations and cause direct 
friction between the Palestinian and Israeli people, until such 
a time when settlement as a whole would end, for, in our view, 
it was unnecessary to begin with. 
  [Khashanah] Do you believe that the revival of the 
intifadah, with the old thrust and even more strongly, would 
weaken the negotiation trend or strengthen the position of the 
Palestinian negotiators? 
  ['Abbas] The intifadah was initiated against the occupation 
and it will continue as long as the occupation continues, and it 
will grow day after day whenever massacres such as the Hebron 
al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre are committed and as long as other 
tragedies befall the Palestinian people. It is an expression of 
the Palestinian people's determination to end the occupation. 
  If the Israeli Government wants to coexist with the 
Palestinians, it must eliminate all the causes of friction and 
provocation which are real obstacles and barriers in the way of 
the peace process. 
  [Khashanah] Will the Palestinian suspension of the 
negotiations continue until the PLO's request for disarmament of 
the settlers and freezing of the settlements is granted? 
  ['Abbas] We have summoned the heads of the Palestinian 
negotiating delegations to leadership headquarters in Tunis for 
consultation on the measures to be taken in the wake of that 
massacre. 
  [Khashanah] Will a Palestinian delegation go to Washington 
in response to President Clinton's invitation addressed to the 
PLO and Israel? 
  ['Abbas] In principle, I see no objection to acceptance of 
the invitation, but before the (Palestinian) leadership says yes 
or no, we must have answers to many important inquiries handed 
by brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] to the U.S. ambassador in Tunis. 
  [Khashanah] Such as? 
  ['Abbas] The purpose of moving the negotiations to 
Washington, the level of the delegations to the negotiations, 
and other matters. 
  [Khashanah] Have you noticed that the number of Palestinians 
killed under this current Labor government is more than the 
number of those killed under Likud? That casts heavy shadows on 
the declared peaceful intentions of the ruling Labor Party. 
  ['Abbas] If we look at the general historical course of 
events and examine the Arab-Israeli conflict developments, we 
would notice that the Labor Party controlled the Jewish Agency 
in the early days and it still does, and it was the Labor Party 
which founded the state of Israel and fought the 1956, 1967, and 
1973 wars against the Arabs. It was also the Labor Party which 
started the settlements, killed the fedayeen and crush their 
bones in full view of the whole world. But we are dealing with 
a state and an institution which, if it differs under different 
governments on some issues, is always in agreement on many other 
issues.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Samir </F>
Ghawshah, by Sa'id Mu'addi, place and date not given; from the 
"With the Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO 
Executive Committee: The PLO leadership is continuing its 
consultations with all parties. Does this mean this decision 
will be crucial and decisive for the peace process? 
  [Ghawshah] The PLO leadership is continuing its contacts on 
all levels and in more than one area, whether on the Arab or 
international levels. In the meantime, the PLO leadership is 
pursuing political activity on all levels. We would like to say 
that the support extended to us and the denunciation and 
condemnation of the massacre perpetrated against our people in 
Hebron are indications that the world understands and 
sympathizes with the just Palestinian demands. Moreover, we 
believe that much of the future of the political process hinges 
upon the positions to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government 
and on the measures and positions that will be taken toward the 
Palestinian demands for the sake of advancing the peace process 
and extricating it from the vicious circle. I think the 
experience of the past months clearly showed that it was the 
Palestinian side which was serious in its quest for peace, 
termination of all acts of violence, withdrawal, and coexistence 
for all peoples in the region. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, the peace cosponsors--Russia and the 
United States--are mediating an end to the causes which stopped 
the peace talks. Yesterday, a Russian envoy met with Yasir 
'Arafat and will meet today with the decisionmakers in Israel. 
What conditions has the PLO conveyed to the Russian envoy? 
  [Ghawshah] During yesterday's meeting, the Russian envoy and 
brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] discussed in detail the peace 
process and the obstacles facing it, especially the recent 
developments. The most important point of discussion was the 
need to provide protection and security for our people, 
especially after it has been proven that the Israeli Army did 
not and will not carry out its duty in preventing attacks on our 
people. The two sides discussed the obstacles facing the peace 
process and Israel's failure to carry out its commitments as 
stated in the Declaration of Principles. These included its 
delay of withdrawal from the Jericho and Gaza areas, earlier 
scheduled for 13 December. The entire peace process was 
discussed. A basic Palestinian demand was submitted; namely, 
the need to provide protection and security for the Palestinian 
people and international observers to guarantee this security. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir, when do you expect the 
Israeli-Palestinian talks to resume and what about the 
Palestinian delegation which will leave for Washington? 
  [Ghawshah] The matter depends primarily on the measures and 
policies to be adopted by Mr. Rabin and his government. This is 
the issue. The first fact which should be considered is the 
degree of seriousness in taking measures and responding to the 
Palestinian people's just demands. This is the first basic 
factor. The second is the extent to which the cosponsors of the 
political process will play their role and give a new push to 
the peace process. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, member of the PLO Executive 
Committee. Thank you very much. 
  [Ghawshah] Thank you.

  [Text] Tunis, 1 Mar (MENA)--The PLO has decided not to send 
a Palestinian delegation to Washington to participate in 
negotiations with Israel tomorrow, Wednesday, according to a 
U.S. proposal to shift the venue to Washington for accelerated 
talks between the two sides to discuss implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  PLO Executive Committee member Samir Ghawshah said the 
committee decided at its meeting last night to continue its 
suspension of the talks with the Israeli side and not to resume 
them before securing adequate protection for the Palestinian 
people. 
  A high-level Palestinian source said that Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
the head of the Palestinian delegation to the Cairo talks and 
'Arafat's political adviser, will leave for Washington within 
hours on an assignment from the PLO leadership to explore the 
aim of the U.S. invitation to move the talks to Washington. The 
source added that Sha'th will explain to the U.S. Administration 
the Palestinian side's concern over the failure to meet a 
request to provide protection for the Palestinian people under 
occupation. The official described the U.S. stance as bad and 
said it was worse than the Israeli position. 
  Ghawshah said that the PLO Executive Committee has rejected 
the Israeli proposals and offers because they do not meet its 
basic demand of providing protection for the Palestinians. He 
added that the PLO also rejected the Israeli proposals to resume 
the negotiations because there are new realities and the 
circumstances created by the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron 
need radical remedies. 
  Ghawshah declared: We are waiting for Israeli measures that 
will deal with the essential problem which is the settlements. 
  He noted that the PLO has not yet made a decision whether to 
accept or decline U.S. President Clinton's proposal to move the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to Washington and that this 
issue is under intensive discussion among the Palestinian 
leaders to explore the aim behind the proposal, whether it will 
give impetus to the peace talks, and the possible role that the 
United States can play in these talks. 
  Ghawshah added that the PLO decided to conduct a series of 
consultations and communications with the Arabs and other 
concerned parties. 
  Head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi and Fatah 
Central Committee member Abu-Mahir Ghunaym are due to visit 
Damascus today for discussions with Syrian officials about the 
peace negotiations. 
  An envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin is also due to 
arrive in Tunis later today to discuss the latest developments 
of the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. 
  'Arafat earlier sent a message to Indonesian President and 
the president of the Nonaligned Movement Suharto asking for an 
urgent and immediate meeting of the movement's Palestine Bureau 
or Presidency Bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli 
massacre, possible international protection for the 
Palestinians, disarming the Zionist settlers. 
  'Arafat also sent a message to Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf, current chairman of the Islamic Conference Organization 
[ICO], asking for an urgent meeting of the ICO chairmanship 
bureau to discuss the implications of the Israeli massacre of 
the Palestinian citizens, the need to provide international 
protection for the Palestinians, and disarming the settlers. 
  The PLO Executive Committee will continue its discussions of 
the position that it will adopt on the peace negotiations and 
the U.S. proposal to move them to Washington. It has been 
learned that the Palestinian leaders will not make any decision 
until the Security Council issues a resolution about the Hebron 
incident. 
  It has also been learned that during last night's meeting 
sharp arguments took place and diverse attitudes surfaced. A 
considerable number of the Executive Committee members demanded 
that the negotiations continue to be suspended, and perhaps 
boycotted. This group rejects the U.S. proposal to move the 
talks to Washington unless the Palestinian demands are met. 
  Meanwhile, 'Arafat and several other members urged patience 
before making a final response to the U.S. proposal, suspending 
the negotiations for a certain period, perhaps for a week, but 
not boycotting them so that it might be possible to resume them 
after the Palestinian anger cools down. The Palestinian public 
is demanding a boycott of the negotiations and even abolishing 
the agreement reached with Israel. 
  'Arafat, who wishes to resume the talks on condition that 
several Palestinian demands are met, is in a difficult position 
after Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon declared they were boycotting 
the Washington talks to protest the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
They said they will not resume the talks until after the 
Palestinians do so.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, returned to Cairo 
this evening after a three-day visit to Tunis, during which he 
participated in the meetings of the Palestinian leadership and 
the PLO Executive Committee. 
  Dr. Sha'th stated upon arrival that he is carrying a letter 
from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to President Husni 
Mubarak dealing with the current situation and contacts during 
the next stage. These fall within the framework of Palestinian 
contacts and action during the period when the negotiations are 
suspended. 
  Sha'th clarified that Palestinian activity will consist of 
his going to London; Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO 
Information Department, to Paris; and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the 
PLO Political Department, to Damascus. 
  He added that another Palestinian envoy will travel to 
Washington to hold talks with U.S. officials. 
  The Palestinian official said that after the horrible 
massacre, which is rife with collusion and menace, we need to 
take a stand to guarantee security for the Palestinian people 
under occupation. There cannot be peace without security and the 
situation cannot continue as it is with the presence of the 
armed settlers under the protection of the Israeli army shooting 
everywhere and killing innocent people. 
  Sha'th noted in his statement that the Palestinian stand 
will 
provide an opportunity for taking swift action through the 
Security Council and through negotiations with the Americans. 
  He praised the important roles Nabil al-'Arabi, Egypt's 
permanent representative to the United Nations, and Ahmad Mahir, 
Egypt's ambassador in Washington, are playing to bolster the 
Palestinian stand. He pointed out that 'Arafat is holding 
constant meetings with a number of Arab and foreign officials. 
He will meet this evening with a Russian envoy, and then a 
Greek envoy because Greece is the current chairman of the 
European Community. 
  Sha'th noted that 'Arafat has contacted President Mubarak 
more than once. He also contacted Indonesian President Suharto, 
Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Saudi Arabian King Fahd, and 
Moroccan Monarch King Hassan II, and discussed with them the 
situation and action to guarantee the security of the 
Palestinian people so that the peace process can continue on a 
sound and correct basis. 
  Sha'th said that suspending the negotiations represents a 
hiatus because, at this time, we cannot continue these talks. 
We need to prepare a sounder basis for continuing them. 
  On the guarantees the Palestinians are demanding, Sha'th 
said 
that two of the most important guarantees are to provide 
international protection on the one hand, and disarm the 
criminal settlers on the other, because disarming the settlers 
achieves some security for the Palestinians. The presence of 
international protection adds life to this security. After 
these two conditions are met, there are many things that need to 
be reviewed, such as the settlement process. We need to put 
pressure on the international conscience so that it will see 
that settlement is one of the obstacles before peace. 
  Sha'th said that there is another important issue that the 
Palestinian envoy to Washington will discuss during his meetings 
with officials there. This is that the criminal who committed 
the Hebron massacre, and most extremists and criminals in 
Israel, are of U.S. origin. There is a clear relationship 
between them and some legitimate U.S. organizations that gather 
aid and contributions from the United States to fund and support 
these extremists in Israel. 
  Sha'th pointed out that when Likud Party leader Netanyahu 
was 
in the United States, he was with these criminals from the Kach 
gang, as was Kahane, who collected contributions from them. 
  Therefore, the United States has to bear its responsibility 
in this regard where financing terrorism publicly is a major 
responsibility. 
  As regards the steps Israel has taken, such as releasing 
some 
Palestinian detainees and disarming some settlers, Sha'th said: 
This was nothing new. Shahaq told me before the massacre was 
committed that some detainees would be released during the 
current week. However, they tried to exploit this point once 
again. 
  I reiterate that the new aspect in the Israeli reaction has 
been their admission that religious and racist extremism and 
terrorism are characteristics that apply to the Israeli settlers 
as well, after they had been using them to describe the 
Palestinians. Despite this confession, the deterrents and 
punishments are devoid of any content and represent only 
something shamefully negligible.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F>
adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in Tunis, by Sa'id 
Mu'addi, in the studio, date not given; from the "With the 
Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, currently in Tunis, good 
evening. 
  [Sha'th] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, what is your initial reaction to the 
government's decision to release approximately 1,000 detainees 
and prisoners from the West Bank and Gaza Strip? 
  [Sha'th] Naturally, one wants freedom for all his fellow 
citizens and people. We have worked determinedly at the table 
of negotiations to secure the release of all Palestinian 
detainees and not to keep any of our children in prisons and 
detention camps. This is a duty that we must pursue. When any 
citizen is released, this means that freedom has been restored 
to a human being who has suffered gravely. However, as you 
know, this move is one of the results of this horrendous 
massacre which claimed many lives in the Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. I believe that besides releasing those detainees, many 
things must be done in order to safeguard our people and prevent 
the recurrence of such dreadful massacres. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, you are taking part in the PLO 
leadership's consultations. Are there final decisions? 
  [Sha'th] The meetings are continuing tonight. They have been 
going on for two days. This is because the incident was so 
grave and the responsibility is so heavy. We should continue 
work to provide protection for our Palestinian people. 
Therefore, the final results of these meetings will not appear 
before the end of tonight. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what is the PLO leadership's trend 
regarding the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
  [Sha'th] This is one of the important questions which we 
must 
decide tonight. Russian President Yeltsin has sent a high-level 
envoy. He asked us to await his arrival before arriving at our 
final decision. We will respect this wish. We are waiting to 
meet with this envoy before we arrive at results, especially 
with regard to the negotiations. Naturally, we do not want to 
halt the peace process, which will eventually bring about 
Israeli withdrawal and freedom for our people. However, we are 
fully aware that important, sufficient, and necessary guarantees 
must be provided for the peace process. We are responsible for 
our people and for their freedom, security, and protection. 
This makes the decision difficult and guarantees necessary. 
  [Mu'addi] When will the Palestinian delegation leave for 
Washington for talks with the U.S. Administration on the 
resumption of the negotiations? 
  [Sha'th] Soon. I believe that what is required now is to 
hold consultations with the U.S. Administration to provide these 
guarantees. As I have already mentioned, there will also be 
consultations with the Russian Government. There are other 
consultations with the Arab, European, and other world 
governments. What is required, effectively, is to have the 
international community assume its responsibility and to agree 
on measures for the protection of the peace process through 
providing security for our people. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, one last question. Israel has agreed in 
principle on the presence of international observers in Jericho 
and Gaza. What is your comment? 
  [Sha'th] This is an important move. It is referred to in the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP], which we signed in Washington. 
The DOP provides for a temporary international presence. 
Naturally, we want any international presence to be only 
temporary; that is, until withdrawal is completed, the 
Palestinian police assume their responsibilities, and until we 
reach a solution that ensures security and peace for all sons of 
our people. Therefore, this move is necessary and important. 
It must provide the minimum level of protection. The other 
point, which is equally important, is the removal of the causes 
which led to this odious crime, primarily those settlers who 
carry weapons and open fire wherever they go. These are two very 
important conditions for providing protection and for the 
prevalence of security and stability so that the peace process 
can maintained. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, currently in Tunis, thank you 
very much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, brother. Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today met Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Taba talks. The meeting was attended by Sa'id 
Kamal, the Palestinian ambassador in Cairo. 
  Afterward, Dr. Sha'th said he gave Minister Musa a message 
from the Palestinian leadership to President Husni Mubarak. He 
said the message deals with developments following the 
abominable and criminal massacre committed by Israeli settlers 
with the support and backing of Israeli army units in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, developments to come in relation with 
this issue, and the Palestinian leadership's insistence on 
providing security for the Palestinian people under occupation 
until the Israeli withdrawal is effected according to the peace 
agreements. Sha'th added that it is impossible now to proceed 
with the negotiations with the Israelis without clear-cut and 
effective measures to disarm the settlers, secure international 
protection, and reconsider the settlement issue. He noted that 
this is an important issue without which it is difficult to 
build a real base for progress in the talks, as the Americans 
demand.

  [Text] Tunis, 1 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian news agency 
WAFA reported tonight that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
received a written message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The agency said that 'Arafat received this message when he 
met this evening with Mr. Igor Ivanov, Russian President 
Yeltsin's envoy, and that 'Arafat and Ivanov held extended and 
detailed talks on the current stage of the Middle East peace 
process after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. They 
discussed the results of that massacre when all Arab parties to 
the talks suspended negotiations with Israel. 
  The news agency said that during his meeting, 'Arafat 
concentrated on the basic Palestinian demands at this stage, 
which are: 
  First, sending an international or multinational force to 
the 
occupied Palestinian territories, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
by coordinating and consulting with the co-sponsors of the peace 
process, the United States and Russia, and the UN secretary 
general to guarantee the security and safety of the Palestinian 
people there. 
  Second, disarming the settlers and preserving public peace. 
  Third, starting to dismantle the settlements that have 
extremists in them.

  [Text] Amman -- Sulayman al-Najjab, member of the PLO 
Executive Committee and member of the Palestinian People's Party 
Political Bureau, has said that he did not travel to Tunis to 
participate in the Executive Committee's meeting yesterday 
evening in protest at the position of President 'Arafat, who 
gave his consent to President Clinton's invitation to transfer 
the talks to Washington. This, at a time when the Palestinian 
people, inside and outside, are unanimous on suspending those 
talks until international protection is provided to them against 
the massacres to which they are being subjected by the settlers 
and the Israeli Army and for which the Israeli Government is 
totally responsible, and until the settlements are dismantled 
and the settlers are disarmed. 
  Al-Najjab stressed that 'Arafat's acceptance of this 
invitation turns the Executive Committee meeting into a mere 
formality and a cover for a decision which he made alone and for 
which only he is responsible. 
  Al-Najjab called on his colleagues in the Executive 
Committee 
to listen to the people's voice and adhere to their calls for 
protection and liberation from the settlers' belligerence. 
  Al-Najjab pointed out that the U.S. position in the Security 
Council seeks to foil any serious resolution by the Council to 
condemn the crime, provide international protection, and 
implement its resolutions relating to the settlements, which it 
considers to be illegal and must be removed. Thus, it is clear 
that the aim of President Clinton's invitation is in harmony 
with the U.S. position in the Security Council and seeks to 
deflect the international campaign of condemnation against the 
Israeli Government. This position must be exposed instead of 
giving it credibility by quickly agreeing to go to Washington. 
  The Israeli Government has declared its rejection of the 
Palestinian demands regarding international protection and 
disarming of the settlers. This proves that the expressions of 
condemnation uttered by Israeli officials are just words of 
consolation, whereas what is required is the adoption of 
practical measures that prevent the recurrence of such crimes. 
This increases our doubt about the Israeli Government's 
intentions to adhere to serious negotiations that really seek to 
implement the resolutions of international legitimacy and end 
the Israeli occupation. 
  All this requires the Palestinian leadership to undertake a 
comprehensive reassessment rather than hastily agree to the 
resumption of the talks and to shifting them to Washington, 
while no shift has been made either in Israel's or Washington's 
position despite the gravity of all that has happened.

<F P=106> [Interview with Palestinian leader Ahmad al-Tibi by an </F>
unidentified L'UNITA reporter in Jerusalem; date not given: 
"`Israel Must Choose: The Colonists or Peace';" first paragraph 
is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- "We renounced immediate discussions 
over two things of fundamental importance, i.e., the status of 
Jerusalem and the dismantling of Jewish settlements, in order to 
reach an initial accord with Israel. But after what has 
happened in Hebron there can no longer be any postponement. 
Yitzhaq Rabin must choose: peace or the settlements." This is 
what Ahmad al-Tibi maintains. He is currently the most 
authoritative individual among the Palestinians in the 
territories: He is in charge of relations with PLO headquarters 
in Tunis. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres met with 
al-Tibi on 27 February to discuss the measures adopted by the 
government to put a stop to the actions of extremist colonists. 
  [L'UNITA] How do you judge the measures taken by the Israeli 
Government against the extreme right-wing Jewish movements? 
  [Al-Tibi] The measures adopted by Rabin can perhaps reduce 
the pain but they do not extirpate the disease. The disease 
that can terminate the peace process is represented by the 
Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. 
  [L'UNITA] But is the disarmament of the more extremist 
faction of the colonists not a first step to reopening the issue 
of the future of the settlements? 
  [Al-Tibi] I would not be so confident. I think that the 
measures currently adopted represent the maximum "concession" 
that Rabin is willing to make, not only to the Palestinians but 
also to the left wing of his party and the government. Rabin 
talks of disarming the extremist elements among the colonists 
but it is precisely on the concept of "extremists" that we 
disagree with the Israeli prime minister. 
  [L'UNITA] Do you think that there are extremists in the 
settlements? 
  [Al-Tibi] Certainly, and not only the "Kakh" activists. In 
the meeting held Sunday evening with Peres, I asked a question 
and am still waiting for a response: How does the Israeli 
Government judge the head of the Kiryat Arba settlement who 
refused to condemn the massacre at the Tomb of the Patriarchs: 
Is he an extremist or not? There are extremist groups that have 
not yet committed crimes like the one in Hebron, but their 
militants play an active role in the Arab manhunt, attack 
Palestinians in the streets, destroy their cars, and impede any 
productive activity. My question to Rabin is: Are these not 
extremists who should be disarmed? As far as we are concerned, 
the answer is yes. Even these elements, and there are thousands 
of them, should be disarmed. Before returning to the 
negotiating table, we want to verify the criteria that the 
Israeli authorities will use to determine who is extremist and 
must be disarmed and who instead has the right to go about the 
Occupied Territories with a machine gun and pistols. 
  [L'UNITA] The "Meretz" leaders, who also have never approved 
the colonization of the territories carried out by right-wing 
governments, maintain that Israel could not support a sudden 
turnabout on the settlements. 
  [Al-Tibi] I understand their concern, but they must also 
realize that the politics of always postponing, and delaying, 
the issue of dismantling the settlements to "a later date," has 
only produced hate, violence, and death in the territories. On 
the other hand, we did not ask that all the settlements 
disappear as of tomorrow. Our request is simply to place this 
topic first on the negotiations agenda. In view of what 
happened in Hebron, quite frankly this does not seem to be an 
"extremist" request. 
  [L'UNITA] In concrete terms, what do you Palestinians 
consider as being the best way to solve the problem of the 
settlements? 
  [Al-Tibi] Our principal concern today is that of protecting 
the population in the territories from the violence of the 
colonists. We feel that the best solution is to reconcile the 
schedules for the evacuation of the settlements with the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This 
being for a reason that Israel cannot refuse to acknowledge: If 
another massacre like the one at Hebron were to take place after 
the entry into effect of the independence of the two 
territories, the Palestinian population would accuse the PLO of 
being jointly responsible for that crime, for having accepted 
that the settlements remain standing. And this would mean 
playing the game of the Hamas integralists. 
  [L'UNITA] 'Arafat in Tunis has once again asked the United 
Nations to guarantee international protection for the 
Palestinians in the territories, but Israel has rejected this 
proposal. 
  [Al-Tibi] I find this rigidity by the Tel Aviv government 
entirely unjustifiable, and I am saying this precisely on the 
basis of what is sanctioned by the additional protocol of 
Article 3 of the Declaration of Principles set out in Oslo. The 
appendix reads: "A temporary international presence may be 
provided for in the area of Gaza and Jericho to guarantee the 
implementation of the accords." This is what we are asking for 
today. Nothing more. 
  [L'UNITA] Among the decisions adopted by the Israeli 
Government is the establishment of a commission of inquiry into 
the Hebron massacre. What do you expect from this commission? 
  [Al-Tibi] The verification that the military authorities 
were 
responsible for not having guaranteed safety in holy places. It 
is not sufficient to punish the soldiers who fired at the exit 
of the mosque. The Israeli Army is called upon to guarantee 
safety to all inhabitants of the West Bank. But up to now it 
has interpreted this mandate in a unilateral sense: For the 
Israeli military commandos, the Palestinians are the potential 
terrorists and not people to be protected from the violence of 
the colonists. 
  [L'UNITA] But the Israeli Government is claiming that 
disarming all the colonists would be the same as handing them 
over to "Hamas." 
  [Al-Tibi] It is the opposite: It is the presence of the 
colonists, with their charge of violence that is helping Hamas 
to justify their armed battle. Because those settlements, 
together with the massive presence of the Israeli Army, are the 
living symbol of an occupation that is still present, despite 
Washington. The only way to save peace is by separating the two 
communities. 
  [L'UNITA] And now, Dr. al-Tibi, what will happen? 
  [Al-Tibi] The future of the talks is hanging by a thread: It 
is up to Israel and the United States not to break it. More 
than five months have passed since the signing of the accords on 
Gaza and Jericho, but life in the territories has not improved: 
People continue to suffer and die. What has been promised must 
be implemented, and it must be done as soon as possible. Today 
the restart of talks passes necessarily through Kiryat Arba, 
Ariel, and the other Jewish settlements in the territories. 
Peace is incompatible with this presence. Rabin must take note 
of this. But if the colonists are not disarmed, if Israel once 
again refuses to discuss the times and the ways for dismantling 
the settlements, then we will be obliged to tell our people to 
pick up their weapons, because this would be the only way of 
protecting ourselves.

  [Text] [Beindorff] Mr. al-Franji, you can certainly tell 
us what the results of last night's meeting in Tunis were. What 
are the PLO's preconditions for further negotiations? 
  [Al-Franji] The demands of the Palestinians after the 
massacre are clear. They are looking for protection for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories and they demand that 
not just a few settlers but all the settlers be disarmed. It is 
obvious that this issue must be discussed between us and the 
Israelis so that something like the terrible massacre of Friday 
cannot happen again. In addition, many Palestinians who 
enthusiastically advocated the peace process a month ago are now 
doubting whether it is worth negotiating peace while 
experiencing war every day. Of course, there is disappointment, 
bitterness, and the massacre has achieved its aim. 
  [Beindorff] The PLO seems to demand that UN blue helmets are 
positioned in the occupied territories and not just unarmed UN 
observers. Do you think that you can push this demand through? 
Is it absolutely necessary for you? 
  [Al-Franji] This demand is very legitimate. The Israeli 
Army cannot safeguard the security of the Palestinians in these 
territories. Immediately after the massacre when the 
Palestinians were demonstrating, they fired on the crowd. The 
number of casualties in the West Bank and Gaza went up 
afterward. This shows that the Israeli Army cannot be neutral 
in this conflict. And the Israeli Army does not intend to 
disarm all the settlers. This means that it takes a burden off 
the Israelis and their army if international protection troops 
are stationed between us and the Israeli settlers until we have 
found a solution to the problem. If they want, we could have 
U.S. and British UN soldiers so that the Israelis do not fear 
that a front is being formed against them. It has become very 
obvious that the Israeli Army is no longer in a position to 
control the West Bank and Gaza and that it cannot keep the 
settlers under control either. 
  [Beindorff] Disarming the settlers is one of the PLO's main 
demands. Who is to protect the settlers? Or is this meant as a 
start to the breaking up of the settlements? 
  [Al-Franji] When we excluded this question the Palestinians 
hoped that the problem would be solved by the Israelis leaving 
the country. They live in the West Bank, which is 5,400 square 
kilometers. In this territory there live 1.3 million 
Palestinians. And right among them live 150,000 Israeli settlers 
who occupied the land illegally and built their houses 
illegally. This decision of the settlers has not been accepted 
by international organizations. You must imagine that in Gaza 
nearly 1 million people live in 365 square kilometers. And 
there are 5,400 Israeli settlers, claiming 160 square 
kilometers. This is unbelievable. It is just not normal; and 
this is a situation that will lead to confrontations if we 
cannot find a solution quickly. And because we Palestinians are 
determined to get the peace process so far that we can achieve 
peace with the Israelis, we think that the Israeli Government 
can yield on this question. If the Israeli Government wants a 
lasting peace then it must make concessions in this matter and 
they must think about whether they want peace, or the 
settlements and the settlers. 
  [Beindorff] If I understand you correctly, peace is only 
possible if the settlements in the occupied territories 
disappear. 
  [Al-Franji] It is clear that in the long run they will 
disappear, or they will have to give in to the Palestinian 
authority that is forming there. This means if they accept, 
just like the Arabs living in Israel, Palestinian passports and 
Palestinian authority, this would be a new situation where we 
could discuss the issue with the Israelis. But the majority of 
settlers say they will not accept Palestinian authority and that 
they will use force to question this authority. And that is 
what they have done. This action in Hebron was meant to prove 
that the settlers can do it; and they can. 
  [Beindorff] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is accused of making 
too many concessions to the Israelis. Does 'Arafat still 
represent the interests of the majority of Palestinians? 
  [Al-Franji] Yasir 'Arafat does represent the interests of 
the majority of Palestinians. Of course, the disappointment of 
many Palestinians is understandable. It is disappointment 
because Yasir 'Arafat, and the PLO leadership, has promised that 
the Israelis will withdraw on 13 December. They did not 
withdraw. They said that the violence in the occupied 
territories will decline. The violence has increased. The 
activities of the Israeli Army have become much tougher. And of 
course, this is what the Palestinians experience. They say: 
Yasir 'Arafat has signed an agreement; he promised us a better 
life; he promised us freedom. And they see that we have been 
living in a state of permanent confrontation since September. 
And this massacre that concerns so many people brings up 
emotions and outcries. There are protests, and maybe also nasty 
words against 'Arafat and the PLO leadership. 
  [Beindorff] Mr. al-Franji, you are going to Tunis today. 
Do you expect a debate on the PLO leadership there? 
  [Al-Franji] Discussions within the PLO have never ended; 
discussions about the way we lead the PLO. We have never simply 
accepted a Palestinian leader within our ranks without being 
critical toward him, and this includes Yasir 'Arafat. But on 
the other hand, we cannot question these people's credibility 
whenever a conflict arises. We are in a very difficult process. 
We cannot prove quickly enough to the Palestinians that we have 
achieved some progress. We will have to count on two things: 
First, the Israelis must take us into account and give way on 
these matters in order to help us. Second, we demand, or we 
hope, or we ask, that the European Union, those countries that 
have good relations with Israel, do not pressure Israel but make 
recommendations so that they give way on certain difficult 
problems, such as the matter of settlements, and other problems 
which involve the Palestinians' possibility to get an autonomous 
state. 
  [Beindorff] One last question, and I ask you to give me a 
very short answer. The Security Council has not yet agreed on a 
resolution. When do you expect an answer? 
  [Al-Franji] We are waiting for this answer. And what the 
PLO will do partly depends on the Security Council's decision. 
We hope that it will react in a responsible way. 
  [Beindorff] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] The pursued Fatah hawks strugglers inside and 
outside the occupied territories have issued a statement saying: 
The heinous crime and the dastardly massacre perpetrated 
against our people's sons at the Ibrahimi Mosque, a house of 
God, in the blessed month of Ramadan is cogent proof of the 
impossibility of peace or coexistence with the enemies of God 
and mankind. 
  The statement added: We, the pursued Fatah hawks inside and 
outside the occupied territories, demand that the 'Arafat 
leadership halt its negotiations with the Zionist enemy. 
Similarly, we demand all fighting Palestinian factions to unify 
themselves in the crucible of the revolution and armed struggle 
against enemy troops and the hordes of settlers, who are engaged 
in murder and terrorism against our Palestinian people, who are 
fighting the Zionist injustice and repression. 
  Concluding their statement, the Fatah hawks said: Our 
people's dignity cannot be safeguarded unless we extricate our 
national rights by force, just as they have been usurped by 
force.

  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued 
a statement declaring the decision of Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon 
to suspend the ongoing negotiations in protest against the ugly 
massacre of innocent worshipers at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque a 
good step. 
  Hamas denounced the shaky, hesitant position of Yasir 
'Arafat 
as a submissive position that does not take into consideration 
the Palestinian blood that has been spilled or the anger of the 
Palestinian people everywhere. 
  The statement further said: We think that 'Arafat's stands 
serve the interests of the Zionist enemy, which seeks to placate 
popular rage over the massacre. 
  The statement added: We consider insistence on pursuing a 
policy of relinquishment and continuing the negotiations, rather 
than responding to an overwhelming popular desire to withdraw 
from the talks, as treason against our people. 
  An official Hamas spokesman said that it is a priority of 
the 
popular forces to maintain a strong popular momentum inside the 
territories and in the diaspora and to remain determined to 
achieve their goals.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, by Ra'id Salihah in Amman; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Salihah] How will Hamas react to the brutal 
massacre perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque? 
  [Ghawshah] I would like to say that the massacre was 
directed 
against the city of Hebron, which is known for its conservatism 
and Islamic character. [passage omitted] 
  This strike is going to further Hamas' determination, will, 
and strength. Everyone knows that Hamas' fighters, 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam groups, are well educated in the Islamic doctrine, 
which excels the Torah's doctrine. Therefore, the battle is now 
between the followers of the Torah and the followers of the 
Koran. We believe that victory will be for the followers of the 
Koran. [passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Is there any specific plan to carry out operations 
in the near future? 
  [Ghawshah] The way Hamas acts is a difficult one, and it is 
also difficult to understand its organization. However, there 
is room for movement. Hamas will certainly deal blows to the 
Zionist enemy, including the settlers. [passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Do you plan to assassinate those responsible for 
the massacre? 
  [Ghawshah] You know that the killing of individuals does not 
lead to the required results. We want to strike at and damage a 
major center of the Zionist enemy. The mujahidin will choose 
proper targets, God willing. 
  [Salihah] Do you not believe that it is time for all 
factions 
to launch an armed struggle? 
  [Ghawshah] The blessed march, which was staged in Amman and 
in which we took part, proposed that and also called for a final 
withdrawal, rather than a halt or a suspension of the 
negotiations, and for the resumption of armed struggle. This is 
a hard road, but it is the only way to preserve the whole 
nation's dignity. 
  [Salihah] How do you view President 'Arafat's decision to 
continue negotiations despite all that has happened? 
  [Ghawshah] We urged him through the media and stressed that 
this is his last chance and that this was our last call. If he 
does not return to his people and resume armed struggle, he will 
be viewed by his people as part of the Zionists, and he will pay 
the price. We also said that if he and his clique continued to 
pursue their current path, the curses of God, the people, and 
history will befall him. 
  He accepted Clinton's invitation before the martyrs' blood 
was even dry. No nationalist would ever do that. However, it 
seems that due to a widespread popular protest, he began to 
retreat bit by bit and to set some conditions. 
  [Salihah] You said this was your last warning to 'Arafat. 
Does this mean that you will liquidate him if he does not 
respond? 
  [Ghawshah] No. Hamas does not believe in political 
assassination. The last warning comes from the Palestinian 
people themselves. The people will distinguish between what is 
legitimate and what is illegitimate and between what is wrong 
and what is right. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Hamas Executed DFLP Leader in </F>
Gaza"] 
  [Excerpt] Jeddah -- Relations between the Islamic 
Resistance Movement (Hamas) and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] have deteriorated seriously after 
Hamas announced that its armed squads in Gaza executed Yusuf 
Abu-Lafi, head of the DFLP military organ in the Gaza Strip. 
  In a statement issued by "the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads," 
Hamas accused Abu-Lafi (27 years) of having been "an Israeli 
agent." It distributed a videotape of his confessions. 
  The incident marks a further deterioration in the relations 
between the two parties, which are members of the Damascus-based 
Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] opposed to Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Hamas's official spokesman in Jordan Muhammad Nazzal has 
stated that the DFLP's protest against the execution of the head 
of its military organ in Gaza was strange. He told AL-HAYAH 
that the videotape and the confessions of Yusuf Abu-Lafi "were 
sufficient explanation." He stressed that Hamas had given the 
factions allied with it, especially the DFLP, the details 
pertaining to that issue. He added: "It is the general policy 
of Hamas to inform the faction to which an uncovered agent 
belongs of the details, and it will continue to do so." He 
emphasized that "purging the Palestinian factions of agents is 
one of the important programs which all factions should 
cooperate with it to fulfill." 
  The DFLP, however, has protested the incident and described 
the dead man as "a revolutionary commander and a patriotic 
struggler known to the masses of the Khan Yunis camp as one of 
their righteous sons." That came in a DFLP memorandum 
submitted to the APF leadership during its meeting in Damascus 
last Saturday requesting an end to such incidents. 
  Before Hamas claimed responsibility for killing Abu-Lafi, 
the 
DFLP in the Gaza Strip issued several statements describing 
Abu-Lafi as "an honorable struggler" abducted "while performing 
a struggle duty." They accused the abductors of being "agents 
of the occupation authorities" and threatened revenge if he was 
harmed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with George Habash, secretary general of the PFLP </F>
by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-BILAD] What are the obvious lessons to be 
learned from the grisly Hebron massacre? 
  [Habash] The massacre takes us back to the heart of the 
Zionist agenda and its objectives. If there is a lesson to be 
learned from the atrocity, this must be to put the Zionist game 
plan under the magnifying glass, particularly at this moment 
when numerous forces, including Zionism, imperialism, and 
defeatist Arab forces are trying to cover up the true nature of 
the Zionist agenda. Accordingly, it is imperative for 
Palestinian and Arab masses to define their pan-Arab agenda and 
aim at weeding out that cancerous growth. 
  [AL-BILAD] What will the PFLP's [Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine] response to the incident be? Are you 
planning any action? 
  [Habash] Naturally, all our comrades in the occupied 
territories must think up tangible reactions. Palestinian and 
Arab masses outside Palestine must also translate their 
condemnation of the massacre into action. I do not want to 
offer the military struggle as an alterative to the intifadah or 
mass and political struggle. What is called for is an 
integrated militlary, political, and popular plan of action.

  [Text] Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has 
said in an exclusive interview with AL-BILAD that the Zionist 
enemy's atrocious and terrorist campaigns are nothing new. The 
massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque committed at dawn last Friday 
will not be the last, he addded. 
  He said that this brutal massacre came naturally to the 
Israeli enemy, that it is part of common practices against our 
people in Palestine--a people who will not be terrorized by all 
the practices of occupation or by any Israeli military power. 
Their determination to liberate their occupied homeland will 
not be harmed, he added. 
  He said: The brutal massacre the Zionist enemy committed 
against worshipers in the mosque reflects the concessions [made 
by Yasir 'Arafat], which ignore the Palestinian's blood, 
dignity, and rights. The massacre is the fruit of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which has made the Zionist enemy's path 
shorter and given legitimacy to its occupation. 
  He added that what the Ibrahimi Mosque witnessed makes us 
see 
that the real killers are those who encouraged the Jews--such as 
'Arafat--and extended their hands, which are stained with the 
bloods of the people and the cause, to shake the hand of the 
enemy. This enemy found that its interest are served by the 
concessions offered by the 'Arafat leadership. 
  Meanwhile, 'Abd-al-Jabir Burghul, member of the PFLP-GC 
Central Committee told AL-BILAD: We in the PFLP-GC were not at 
all surprised by the massacres committed by the gangs of 
settlers in the occupied territories. Before these massacres, 
several massacres were committed by [Former Israeli Prime 
Minister Menachem] Begin and other Zionist gangs such as the 
massacres in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Nahhalin, and Sabra and 
Shatila. The history of the Zionist movement is full of 
massacres against the Palestinian people. 
  He said: We in the PFLP-GC will never halt our Palestinian 
armed struggle in the occupied territories. The coming days 
will witness military operations against this entity in the 
occupied territories, not outside. 
  He said these operations will target the settlers and the 
gangs that supervised the execution of these massacres, in 
addition to assassinating Israeli officials in the Zionist camps 
as happened in the operation of Khalid Akar [not further 
identified]. 
  He expressed the belief that 'Arafat will go ahead in the 
negotiations process, and said: 'Arafat is a man who became 
involved in this process and will not retreat, the same thing 
happened with [Former Egyptian President Anwar] al-Sadat. We 
hope that what is taking place in the occupied territories will 
be a lesson to 'Arafat and his clique, and that they will 
benefit from this lesson and refrain from wagering on the 
Zionist enemy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F>
DFLP by Ra'id Salihah, in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Salihah] How will the Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] react, beyond rhetoric, to 
the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque? 
  [Hawatimah] As soon as we received word about the massacre, 
the DFLP urged our people inside the occupied homeland and 
abroad to observe a general strike for three days. I declared 
this personally over the radio. Our people's response was 
excellent. Confrontations are still going on. They covered all 
of the 1948-occupied territory, from the Galilee to the Negev. 
This is in addition to the occupied Palestinian territory in 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem. In the 
diaspora, demonstrations, marches, and protests have not stopped. 
  We have also called for a halt to the negotiations on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track until the settlements are dismantled, 
in line with Security Council Resolutions 465, 605, 507, and 
726. These resolutions were issued during the Carter, Reagan, 
and Bush presidencies. We also urged that the settlers be 
disarmed and that international protection be provided for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, as happened in 
Sarajevo. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to these political steps, the intifadah will 
continue to resist occupation and settlement activity. Also, 
armed fedayeen resistance to the occupation troops and the 
settlers will continue. [passage omitted] 
  [Salihah] Do you support fedayeen operations against the 
settlers? How will you react militarily? 
  [Hawatimah] We have stated clearly that the crime will not 
go unpunished. The punishment will definitely be against the 
settlers who are armed to the teeth in full view of the 
occupation. The crimes of the settlers are the outcome of the 
current political climate and Rabin's hawkish policy. Rabin 
insists on having everything: territory, crossings, and 
security. He is also pursuing settlement activity. He 
earmarked $100 million in 1994 to expand the settlements. This 
is in addition to the ideology preached by the Israeli rabbis, 
urging settlement and expansion and making the Palestinian 
territory a disputed land. Therefore, our fedayeen operations 
will necessarily target the settlers. Every settler is a target 
of the strugglers of the Red Star Battalions, the DFLP's armed 
wing. The past stands witness that we are faithful to what we 
declare. The coming days will see appropriate reactions to this 
horrendous massacre. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A spokesman for the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said 'Arafat and his team 
should immediately call a halt to the bilateral and multilateral 
negotiations. They should do this in response to our people's 
desire and in view of the fact that the majority of the PLO 
Executive Committee members have boycotted the Tunis meetings. 
The following members have boycotted the Tunis meetings, either 
because they have resigned, withdrawn, or frozen their 
membership: Taysir Khalid, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, Mahmud 
Isma'il, 'Abdallah Hurani, Shafiq al-Hut, Mahmud Darwish, 
Sulayman al-Najjab, Yasir 'Amr, and Jamal al-Surani. 
  The DFLP spokesman continued: Only eight members met in 
Tunis. Three of them urged a halt to the negotiations. Thus, 12 
out of 18 members are urging a halt to the negotiations. Only 
five members support 'Arafat in responding to Clinton's 
invitation to go to the negotiations in Washington.

  [Text] In its appeal no. 97, the Unified Leadership of the 
Intifadah [ULI] called on the PLO leadership to immediately 
suspend the current talks and return to new bases that 
guarantee, first and foremost, the removal of all settlements 
from the occupied territories, leading to a comprehensive and 
inseparable Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied 
territories, above all holy Jerusalem. This should be done on 
the basis of international legitimacy's resolutions, foremost of 
all Resolution 242. 
  The appeal said that talk about peace and negotiations has 
become a delusion and called for a series of activities, 
including: 
  -- The immediate launching of a comprehensive and 
responsible 
national dialogue with the participation of all national and 
Islamic forces in a bid to unify our people in confronting the 
developments of the present stage. 
  -- A new formulation of national unity on militant bases and 
under the umbrella of Palestinian national constants. 
  -- The hoisting of black flags in the streets and on roofs 
throughout the occupied territories for a period of 40 days. 
  -- The holding of conferences by national and popular 
institutions and prodding international organizations and human 
rights committees to provide temporary international protection 
for our defenseless people. 
  -- The opening of businesses from the morning hours until 
1700. Merchants are urged to adhere to this time.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- The Palestinian popular federations 
have issued a statement about the massacre of the worshipers at 
the Ibrahimi Mosque. The statement places direct responsibility 
for the massacre on the Israeli Government because it is 
responsible for the safety of the Palestinian people under 
occupation. The statement says that the Ibrahimi Mosque 
compound is more akin to a military barracks in view of the 
presence of a large number of Israeli forces there who allow 
groups of settlers to perpetrate their crimes. 
  The statement continues: While condemning this repugnant 
crime, the Palestinian popular organizations call on our 
Palestinian people to consolidate their national unity, escalate 
their brave intifadah, and respond to the settler herds by all 
means in retaliation for the innocent souls of the massacre's 
martyrs. The statement adds: We also call on our people in the 
diaspora to embark on every initiative in support of the 
steadfastness of our people under occupation. Furthermore, we 
call on the Arab nation to bear its pan-Arab and historic 
responsibility toward our people under occupation and provide 
all forms of assistance to enhance their steadfastness and their 
adherence to their land and sanctities. In addition, we call on 
Arab governments to lift the boycott from our people's 
leadership, the PLO, the Palestinian people's legitimate sole 
representative. 
  The statement says: In the face of this repugnant crime, the 
Palestinian popular organizations call on the PLO Executive 
Committee to halt the talks at once and to insist on the removal 
of settlements from all the occupied Palestinian territories, 
including Jerusalem, before returning to the negotiating table. 
What sort of talks and what peace can there be in the shadow of 
massacres, killings, and destruction? 
  The popular organizations have noted the international 
reaction to this disgusting crime and the fact that this 
reaction has been week and limited only to condemnation and 
denunciation. No practical measures and steps to provide 
protection for our people under occupation have been adopted, 
nor have the Israeli authorities been forced to implement the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  The popular organizations call on the United States and its 
president, Bill Clinton, as a cosponsor of the peace conference 
and in view of its international responsibility during this 
stage to cease its unlimited aid to the Israeli Government and 
to force it to implement the Security Council resolutions 
relating to the Palestinian people's rights, especially 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Palestinian 
Arab territories. 
  Moreover, we call on the UN Security Council to adopt 
immediate and practical measures and send international forces 
to protect our Palestinian people from the attacks of 
aggressors, just as in other parts of the world. 
  The Palestinian popular organizations appeal to all parties, 
international organizations, and human rights committees to 
condemn the perpetrators of this horrible crime and to pressure 
their governments and their international agencies to press 
Rabin's government to withdraw its forces and end the occupation. 
  In view of their faith in a just and comprehensive peace, 
the 
Palestinian popular organizations believe that there will be no 
peace in the shadow of occupation and settlements. They also 
believe that this peace will not be achieved unless our people 
attain their inalienable rights -- the right of return, self- 
determination, and establishment of their independent 
Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital -- under 
the leadership of the PLO, our legitimate sole representative.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Crime and the Results"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The cycles of violence which 
the Palestinian territories are witnessing raise a great deal of 
doubt about the continuation of the talks or implementation of 
the accord. While Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has 
always accused radical Muslims of trying to derail the peace 
accord by attacking Israelis, in the wake of the Hebron crime it 
has been proved that the responsibility falls on the shoulders 
of racist Israeli settlers. Rabin's government must confront 
those narrow-minded people and put an end to their provocations. 
Although in yesterday's cabinet session the Israeli Government 
took some steps to restrict the settlers' movements, those steps 
are insufficient to reassure us of what will happen tomorrow. 
The feeling of dejection among our people can only be overcome 
by measures aimed at restraining the settlers, disarming them, 
and preventing them from carrying out provocative acts against 
Palestinians. 
  Although the Palestinian-Israeli accord represented a 
political breakthrough between the two peoples, we are not 
misrepresenting the facts when we say that the deterioration of 
the situation, the nonimplementation of the accord on its dates, 
and Israel's attempt to extract more concessions from the 
Palestinian side were all factors that contributed to a setback 
and erosion of international fervor for the accord. 
Undoubtedly, the accord will be in danger of collapse unless 
Israel takes immediate steps to implement it without waiting for 
agreements on details. It is impossible to reach a finalized 
solution and agreement on all the clauses. The dangers 
surrounding the accord require one to bet on goodwill and begin 
implementing the accord. They also require the commitment of 
the two parties to address the economic concerns in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hebron Massacre Between Words And Action"] </F>
  [Text] The international community now has a golden 
opportunity to consolidate peace in the Middle East. That is, 
if it knows how to settle the settlements issue swiftly and 
without dilution. 
  Anyone who hears international reports on "terrorism" tends 
to think that it is a tradition which was born Arab, lived Arab, 
and is going to die Arab. It is most likely that its definition 
and classification will remain so for some time. 
  But Barukh Goldstein and before him the perpetrator of 
Rishon 
LeZiyyon...through to Menahem Begin, "hero" of the King David 
Hotel operation -- we do not want to make a long list -- confirm 
that terrorism is not necessarily Arab. It is actually a 
serious phenomenon which needs to be studied, reexamined, and 
radically tackled with an open mind that does not condemn 
haphazardly or use double standards. 
  We have heard so much about Arab "terrorism" that we are now 
tired of this tone. We realize that it is actually a planned 
bias designed to conceal right and the demand for it. If we are 
today promised responsible international action on an ugly 
massacre like the Hebron massacre, the first signs in the 
Security Council have not been encouraging, as positions have -- 
as expected -- split between those who are content with verbal 
condemnation and the advocates of practical measures. 
  Goldstein's crime is a state rather than an emotional 
individual reaction. It is a state stemming from a political 
strategy, a conditioned upbringing, and convictions which are 
dangerous in their extremist and closed-mindedness and see 
others' obtaining of humanly acceptable minimum rights as a 
direct threat to them. In view of this situation, it is 
impossible to divide a solution or camouflage a settlement. 
  The world has avoided tackling the problem in the occupied 
territories and senior politicians have deliberately ignored 
what is happening, using numerous excuses all of which cannot 
paper over the cracks or convince a child. And today the 
present Israeli government claims that it is not responsible for 
the convulsions of radical settlers like Goldstein, whom the 
Likud government supported for years. But the ruling Labor 
Party will not be able to wash its hands of its responsibility 
-- both during its rule before and after Likud -- for planting 
scores of "security" or "religious" settlements whose residents 
believe the Palestinians have no right to coexist with them. 
  So any compromise attempt for a settlement that does not 
include a solution to the crux of the question is doomed to 
failure. It is futile to talk today about containing reactions 
without moving quickly to remove the settlements. Their 
continuation is unacceptable politically because it recognizes 
the legitimacy of occupation and its implementation and rewards 
occupation by force. It is also unacceptable at the security 
level because it does not guarantee any peace for unarmed 
Palestinians or secure credibility for their promised "local 
authority." It is also unacceptable demographically because it 
is simply a population time bomb.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "First Action in Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] The shooting down of four Serb ground attack planes 
by NATO may have been prompted to demonstrate that it really 
means business by enforcing UN Resolution 816 on the Bosnian 
no-fly zone. Repeated violations by both Serb aircraft and 
helicopters have been taking place since April 1993 when the UN 
first enforced the ban. NATO showed little inclination and even 
less resolve to punish the violators. Now that they have done 
so, one has some ground to conclude that it was due to either a 
sense of shame or guilt at allowing the Serbs to continue with 
their massacre of the Muslims, as the world media looked on. 
Whatever the reason, the NATO action, belated though it has 
been needs to be commended in the hope that this will not turn 
out to be just a solo exception to Europe's consistent policy of 
turning a blind eye to whatever the Serbs were doing in Bosnia. 
The reason why this reservation has to be articulated is that 
both the UN and the NATO have by their inaction, through default 
or design, helped the Serbs, steeped as their hands are in 
Muslim blood. [sentence as published] The latest manifestation 
of that is NATO's reluctance to bomb those heavy weapons of the 
Serbs which have neither been pulled back from around Sarajevo 
nor handed over to the UN peacekeepers as specifically 
stipulated in the UN ultimatum. Canadian General Aikman on duty 
with the UN forces, has revealed to the international press that 
six Serb tanks deployed round Sarajevo were taken out by the 
Serbs in clear violation of the terms of the ultimatum. And 
these are now likely to be used by them on other fronts. 
  No reason has so far been given by the UN for allowing Serbs 
to continue their bombing of other Muslim enclaves, most notably 
Tuzla. Tuzla and half a dozen other Muslim enclaves are 
surrounded by the Serbs with their heavy guns just as Sarajevo 
was. The UN must now take next logical step and save those 
cities too -- that is, if it is really interested in restoring 
its credibility in the international community.

  [Text] NATO has used force the first time to prvent the 
violation of the "no-fly zone" set up by the United Nations over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina about a year ago. Its planes have shot down 
four Serbian military aircraft while they were returning after 
shelling an arms factory under Muslim control in Bosnia. The 
shooting was carried out after Serb pilots ignored the warning 
to land. Six jets operating from a base in Italy were involved 
in the assault mission. 
  The ban on flights over Bosnia was imposed by the UN 
Security 
Council on April 12, 1993. Since then NATO aircraft monitoring 
the zone detected several violations of the restriction but 
refrained from taking any action against the culprits. It was 
a serious lapse and negated the very purpose of the mandate 
given by the Security Council. Had force been used earlier 
against the defiance of the ban. It would have certainly helped 
in reducing the enormity of Sebian aggression and savagery 
against the severeign government and people of Bosnia. 
Meanwhile, a statement issued on Monday by the Pakistan 
Government rightly points out that the UN ultimatum for the 
withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo has not been fully 
implemented. The Serbs are still keeping their heavy arms in 
position at several points in the exclusion zone and these 
continue to pose a threat to the beleaguered people of the 
Bosnian capital. The Serbs are also redeploying the equipment 
removed from Sarajevo against other Muslim enclaves in Bosnia. 
The UN must act quickly and strongly to stop this criminal 
adventure. Further, the removal of heavy arms from Sarajevo 
alone will not bring an end to the misery and deprivation of 
Sarajevo population. The world body ought to take appropriate 
steps to ensure the restoration of essential services and 
opening of routes to and from the capital. Equally vital is the 
cessation of hostilities throughout Bosnia in order to 
facilitate the process of peace. There is no denying that the 
international community can do a lot in settling the Bosnian 
conflict justly and equitably if it exercises the neccessary 
resolution and firmness in this regard. Much of the onus falls 
on the Western powers including the US. They must not hesitate 
any more to match their words with deeds.

  [Text] The Lok Sabha was informed today that the government 
has categorically conveyed to the U.S. Administration that 
negative pronouncements by its authorities on issues such as 
Kashmir, human rights and Punjab will have a negative impact on 
India-U.S. bilateral relations. Answering a question, the 
minister for external affairs, Mr. Dinesh Singh, said government 
constantly monitors developments having a bearing on India's 
national interests. He said government remains committed to 
policies in consonance with India's national interests and to 
take all steps necessary to safeguard the country's territorial 
unity and integrity. Mr. Dinesh Singh said all the recent 
developments in the United States regarding India have been 
discussed with the Clinton administration, both in Washington 
and Delhi. He said the response has been that these constitute 
and should not be construed to imply any change in U.S. policy. 
The minister said Kashmir is and will remain an integral part 
of India and no mediation will be allowed. He expressed the 
hope that the U.S. Administration will recognize that the 
Pakistan sponsored terrorism is a major obstacle in restoring 
peace and tranquility in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Answering supplementaries, the minister of state for 
external 
affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, informed the Lok Sabha that a lobbyist 
firm is engaged in United States to project India's viewpoints 
on several issues and to neutralize anti-India propaganda. Mr. 
Bhatia said the firm is asked to project India's record as a 
secular democracy, irreversibility of its liberalization, need 
for new technologies and investments. The brief provided to the 
firm also include education of U.S. policy makers about the 
institutional framework provided in India to protect human 
rights.

  [Text] The finance minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, announced 
the union budget proposals for 1994-95 in the Lok Sabha this 
evening. Let us take a look at the main highlights of the 
proposals: 
  Major restructuring of customs and excise duties; reduction 
in interest rates; steps toward full convertibility of the 
rupee; income tax exemption limit raised; steps for adopting 
value-added tax system; and higher outlays for defense, rural 
development, and for employment generation. 
  Indirect tax rate structure has been further simplified 
mainly to encourage the capital goods industry. The peak rate 
of customs duty has been reduced from 85 percent to 55 percent, 
except on baggage and liquor which will continue to attract the 
present rate of duty. Basic customs duty on general capital 
goods and project imports is reduced from 35 percent to 25 
percent. Duty slabs for machine tools reduced from three to 
two. New duty rates are 35 percent and 45 percent. Customs 
duty on steel reduced to 50 percent. Major nonferrous metals 
like copper, zinc, and lead will have a unified rate of 50 
percent to promote investment. 
  Import duty on all types of ores and concentrates has been 
reduced and will now attract a uniform rate of 10 percent. 
Import duty on melting scraps also reduced from 12.5 percent to 
10 percent; iron ore pellets from 15 percent to 10 percent. The 
import duty structure for chemicals and pharmaceuticals has also 
been rationalized and reduced. The peak rate of duty on 
chemicals has been brought down to 65 percent. 
  In the pharmaceutical sector, import duty on a large number 
of raw materials varying between 85 percent to 50 percent at 
present are lowered to 50 percent and 25 percent. Import duty 
on various machinery and raw materials to be used in the leather 
industry has been drastically reduced. The new rate will be 20 
percent. This has been done to boost export efforts of the 
leather industry. Electronics and telecommunication sectors have 
also attracted concessions. Import duty on computer parts has 
been reduced to 50 percent from the present 80 percent. 
Similarly, the import duty on application software reduced from 
85 percent to 20 percent. For nonelectronic parts for the 
manufacture of the telecommunication equipment, import duty has 
been reduced by 10 percent. The new rate will be 40 percent 
while on optical fiber it has been slashed by almost half to 40 
percent. 
  Domestic watch industry will also enjoy concession to make 
it 
internationally competitive. Import duty on some items of 
machinery is reduced by half to 25 percent. The import duty 
structure on coal and petroleum has been simplified. The new 
import duty on these items will be 35 percent. Duty on coke 
from 85 percent to 25 percent. LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] to 
have 15 percent import duty, while naphtha and coal continued to 
be exempted. However, the changes are not to affect the 
administered prices of petroleum products. 
  On the excise front duty [as heard], the finance minister 
has 
also announced major reforms as part of modernizing the tax 
structure. The benefits of the MODVAT [modified value added 
tax] scheme have been extended to capital goods and petroleum 
products. The excise duty for petroleum products are to be 
rationalized. The existing specific rates will be replaced by a 
uniform ad valorem rate of 10 percent. 
  Concessions now available for the fertilizer industry to 
continue. Duty on manmade fibers rationalized. All fibers and 
blended or spun yarns will be charged uniform excise duty of 20 
percent. There will be an ad valorem duty of 60 percent on 
polyester or filament yarn, 30 percent on nylon and 
polypropylene yarn, and 15 percent for viscose filament yarn. 
On cotton yarn, the duty will be now a uniform 5 percent 
instead of the present varying rates. Cosmetics and other 
personal care products are to cost less. The duty rate on these 
products is being reduced from 70 to 50 percent. But cigarettes 
are to cost more. They will attract an additional 12 percent 
duty. However, in the nonfilter segment, the excise duty for up 
to 60 mm category is being reduced from 120 rupees per thousand 
to 60 rupees. 
  To widen the base for indirect taxes, the finance minister 
has proposed to bring the services sector under the tax net. A 
5 percent charge will be made on the amount of telephone bill, 
the net premium charged by nonlife insurance companies and the 
brokerage or commission charged by stock brokers for their 
services.

  [Text] The prime minister has described the budget as 
development oriented with emphasis on poverty alleviation. 
Talking to our correspondent, Mr. Narasimha Rao said the budget 
will mark another step toward achieving social justice. He said 
the fourth successive budget of Dr. Manmohan Singh is a soft one 
with no additional burden on the common man. 
  The former finance minister, Mr. Madhu Dandavate, said that 
the budget will provide uninhibited access to multinationals 
leading to greater unemployment. He said it will also harden 
the decentralized sector. Mr. George Fernandes, Janata Dal, 
said the budget is for the 3 percent rich and there is nothing 
for the poor. Mr. K.P. Unnikrishnan, Congress-S, said that the 
budget is an excellent exercise to keep the reforms on the 
track. Mr. Indrajit Gupta, CPI [Communist Party of India], said 
it is oriented to provide the growth of the private sector only. 
The CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr. 
Somnath Chatterjee, has said that the poor will suffer more by 
the proposals and the finance minister has given self-reliance a 
go-back. The Janata Party president, Dr. Subramaniam Swamy, 
felt that the budget will lead to a setback to the reform 
process because of fiscal indiscipline. The Janata Dal has 
termed the budget as a sugar-coated one and said it will further 
squeeze the pocket of the common man. 
  Talking to our correspondent, the finance minister, Dr. 
Manmohan Singh, said the main goal of the budget is removal of 
poverty and strengthening of the agricultural sector. It is 
toward this end the outlay on antipoverty programs have been 
stepped up by 40 percent and an additional 2,000 crore rupees 
has been provided. Dr. Singh asserted that the budget will not 
have any negative impact in inflation.

parliamentary delegation of the former Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS] abroad, has condemned what he calls the assassination of 
the leader of the Islamic Armed Group, Djaafar El Afghani, and 
of nine of his supporters. Anouar Haddam stressed, I quote, 
that a dialogue with the authorities is pointless if the latter 
persevere in killing innocents, end of quote. He is also 
calling on members of the security forces to desert or to join 
Islamic groups. 
  An Algiers special tribunal has sentenced nine Islamists to 
jail sentences of between three and five years for criminal 
conspiracy. Four other accused have been acquitted.

  [Text] Athens, March 2, IRNA -- Algeria's Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) has denounced the regime of Liamine Zeroual for the 
recent killings of several Islamists and vowed to continue a 
jihad till Algeria is converted into an Islamic state. 
  "At the time when the regime is talking about 
negotiations...we see an increase of assassinations of innocent 
citizens in all parts of the country in order to drive fear and 
terror among the people," said a FIS statement faxed to IRNA 
from Germany. "The criminal cowardly act which was carried out 
by the suppressive forces against the leader, mujahid and martyr 
Sayf al-Islam Djaafar and some of his helpers, the best of 
mujahideen heroes, expresses the real intention of the regime 
which is imposed on the people by fire and sword," said the 
statement issued by the Executive Committee of FIS in Europe. 
  "Let the regime and its helpers know that whenever a leader 
falls other will take his place on the same path till god grants 
us victory," said the statement in Arabic. 
  The Algerian regime this week said its forces had killed 
Djaafar El Afghani and several other members of his group. 
  "There is no solution to the political dilemma in Algeria 
except by total compliance with the will of the people to create 
a just Islamic state which will deliver the people from tyranny, 
oppression and corruption and return to them their freedom and 
respect," it underlined.

committee in charge of ending fighting between the Yemeni Army 
units said yesterday evening that the committee has disengaged 
the warring forces in the southern Governorate of Abyan and 
reached a cease-fire. He added that the committee managed to 
bring the situation in the city of Mudiyah in the Abyan 
Governorate under control and to disengage the two warring

  [Text] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has 
said there is great optimism over the Jordanian-Omani mediation 
efforts. 
  In press statements published today, he said what has been 
published abroad about the Yemeni crisis contains a great deal 
of exaggeration and overstatement. 
  He stressed that the Yemeni people and leadership are 
committed to the implementation of the accord document, which 
was signed in Amman by all Yemeni political forces under the 
auspices of His Majesty King Husayn on 10 Ramadan.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "'Ali Nasir Brigade Besieged, Its </F>
Camp Near Sanaa Shelled"] 
  [Text] London, Sanaa, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Schools in the 
Yemeni governorate of Abyan were closed yesterday and students 
returned to their homes after fighting erupted between forces of 
the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade stationed in Zanjibar and 
forces of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade. Various types of 
weapons were used. 
  Sources in Abyan Governorate emphasized that the clashes 
moved yesterday to Ja'ar, the second largest city on Abyan. The 
scale of the losses resulting from these clashes is not known. 
  Forces from the 1st Tank Division led by Colonel 'Ali Muhsin 
al-Ahmar, half brother of Yemeni 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, supported 
by a tribal force from the Hashid tribes, specifically from the 
al-'Usaymat tribe, and units from the 2nd "'Urubah" Brigade, 
which is stationed in Sa'dah Governorate, launched an attack 
with various types of weapons late last night on the 5th 
Infantry Brigade, which is loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad and whose elements fled to the north following the 13 
January 1986 incidents but confirmed their loyalty to the Yemeni 
Socialist Party [YSP] recently, namely after the rebellion they 
staged against the president's brother, who could not appoint a 
replacement for Col. 'Abdallah Shalil, who is from Abyan, 
because of the refusal of the force's commanders. 
  Military sources in Aden told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
fighting in which forces of the 5th Brigade are engaged with the 
forces led by Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar in the Jabal al-Aswad 
(Harf Sufyan) in 'Imran have resulted in 12 killed and 30 
wounded from the 5th Brigade, and that the forces belonging to 
President Salih's brother used all types of medium and heavy 
weapons in the fighting. 
  The sources added that units of the 1st Tank Division and 
forces of the 2nd "'Urubah" Brigade are still besieging forces 
of the 5th Brigade, cutting off supplies, including food and 
water supplies, and preventing it from moving the wounded and 
the dead from the camp. 
  An official spokesman for the Defense Ministry in Aden held 
military leaders, whom he described as "extremists" and who 
control the centers of decisionmaking in the General People's 
Congress [GPC], fully responsible for these actions. 
  However, an authoritative GPC source described the ongoing 
fighting in Modiyah as terrorist actions carried out by YSP 
militias. The source said that "two military aircraft flew at 
low altitude over Zanjibar the day before yesterday evening near 
the command of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp, breaking the sound 
barrier in a provocative manner to terrify citizens in the city." 
  Information from Abyan says that Lieutenant Colonel Husayn 
'Ali Haytham, former security commander in Abyan Governorate and 
a GPC member, is seeking to storm the security command center in 
Zanjibar to regain his position by force, as he was dismissed 
from his post by the YSP, which appointed 'Ali Ahmad al-Ghawshah 
as his successor. The information confirms that Husayn 'Ali 
Haytham is seeking protection inside the al-'Amaliqah Brigade 
camp in Abyan. 
  At the same level, ambassadors of the EC states in Sanaa 
have 
confirmed that a number of victims have fallen over the past few 
days as a result of the violent clashes which have taken place 
in Yemen.

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council, received yesterday in Aden brother members 
of the Political Forces Dialogue Committee. During the meeting, 
the situation and developments in the national arena were 
discussed in the light of the grave military and information 
deterioration. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice chairman of 
the Presidential Council, evaluated the role of the Dialogue 
Committee and the efforts which it is doing for stopping the 
great deterioration in the current situation. He emphasized the 
importance of finding ways that will secure the implementation 
of the accord document which was signed in the Jordanian 
capital, Amman, as it is the document of the national consensus 
which aims in correcting the track of the unity and promoting 
its democratic [word indistinct] and building its modern state, 
stressing the necessity of rebuffing the old attempt aiming to 
turning around from the accord document and emptying it out of 
its contents by creating a climate of tension and [word 
indistinct], which do not help except in finding the 
circumstances and atmospheres appropriate for the rise of the 
sounds of guns instead of the voice of dialogue and resorting to 
common sense. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid drew attention to the dangers of 
dragging the country into the tunnel of tension and infighting. 
He urged the national Dialogue Committee on the necessity of 
investigations in the breaches which were made after the signing 
of the accord document and in the crimes done against the 
soldiers and the innocent sons of our people who fell drenched 
in blood in the incidents witnessed by Abyan Governorate the 
next day after the signing of the accord document and the bloody 
incidents which the (?36th) Infantry Brigade the [word 
indistinct] was exposed to on 26 and 27 February 1994. He urged 
the Dialogue Committee of the necessity of taking a stand 
towards these irresponsible acts which not only destabilize the 
security and stability of the country, but also threaten the 
social peace and work on pulling the country into the furnace of 
the destruction of war, and also threaten the security and 
stability in the region and damage the national and 
international (?interests in it). 
  Brother the vice chairman of the Presidential Council gave a 
directive with the necessity of putting the official mass media 
under the guidance of the Information Committee, emanating from 
the National Guidance Committee with effect from Tuesday, 1 
March 1994. He also urged the Military Committee emanating from 
the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to make field visits to 
the regions of tension and infighting and particularly to the 
regions of Mudiyah, Mukayras, and al-Bayda for removing the 
atmospheres of tension and stopping the deterioration in the 
military and security aspects and preventing any new military 
manifestations or movements with coordination with the joint 
Military Committee, and coordinating their efforts with the aim 
of [word indistinct] war and restoring peace, security, and 
stability to the entire homeland.

  [Text] The Yemeni News Agency, SABA' has learned from a 
responsible source in the general secretariat of the Council of 
Ministers that brother Dr. Muhammad Hasan Makki, first deputy 
prime minister, in a letter to Prime Minister Engineer Haydar 
Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has commented [words indistinct] that the 
implementation of the pledge and accord document requires, first 
of all, that the constitutional state bodies meet, particularly 
the Presidential Council which represents the country's 
political will. The accord document in the last paragraph of 
its last page stipulates that the implementation of the document 
requires a united political will. 
  Second, on the basis of the coalition government and 
parliamentary coordination document under which the present 
government was formed, and in accordance with this document the 
commands of the coalition parties should hold meetings in case 
[words indistinct] on the topics intended to be discussed at the 
Council of Ministers to [word indistinct] an agreement in this 
[word indistinct]. From this premise, it is important in this 
case to expedite holding a coalition command meeting to discuss 
the litigious draft agenda proposed by you. 
  Third, the present circumstances in Aden, permeated with 
[words indistinct] and media clamor do not contribute to the 
prevalence of a suitable atmosphere for the convocation of a 
cabinet session. 
  Fourth, while [words indistinct] their readiness to exert 
all 
efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord starting 
from the provisions of the document itself, we believe that your 
proposals on the draft agenda are in violation of the document 
and based only on the paper submitted by the Yemeni Socialist 
Party concerning the measures of implementation of the document. 
This paper [words indistinct] accepted by the Political Forces 
Dialogue Committee. 
  Fifth, the bylaws of [word indistinct] Council of Ministers 
stipulates the need to send the documents on the agenda of the 
Council of Ministers to the ministers five days before the date 
set for the meeting. This was not respected [words indistinct] 
current Council of Ministers. In addition, the Council had 
agreed to hold two sessions in Ramadan on the basis of the rule 
that is annually followed. These were actually held. [Words 
indistinct] an extraordinary meeting only and such a meeting is 
held only to discuss [words indistinct]. 
  Sixth, in view of the fact that no party within the 
coalition 
can unilaterally propose the Council's agenda [word indistinct] 
the document of pledge and accord, we propose the following: 
  1. Holding an extraordinary Council of Ministers session in 
the capital Sanaa not later than 5 March to discuss one topic 
only in accordance with the Council of Ministers bylaws. This 
topic is to issue decisions on matters stipulated in the 
document and which are urgent and cannot be postponed; namely, 
the plan to arrest the accused who are at large and issuing the 
decision on withdrawing the Armed Forces from the area that used 
to be called the border areas, in addition to the decision that 
enables the Political Forces Dialogue Committee to carry out its 
follow-up tasks as enunciated in the document. 
  2. As for the other provisions of the pledge and accord 
document, we once again emphasize that the adoption of 
timetables for their implementation and the formation of 
committees for this is is a joint responsibility to be assumed 
by the coalition members and which no party can carry out alone. 
  Out of our concern over [words indistinct] expeditious 
agreement [word indistinct] the Council of Ministers following 
the blessed 'Id al-Fitr holidays, we propose that the prime 
minister and his deputies hold meetings during the period that 
remains from the blessed month to agree on these plans and 
implementation measures in accordance with what is stipulated in 
the document.

  [Text] Damascus, 1 Mar (SANA)--The newspaper TISHRIN has 
stressed that in light of the serious Israeli escalation, it is 
natural for the Arab delegations to view the talks as a waste of 
time and to agree on the need to assess the situation and place 
the international community and the cosponsors of the peace 
process before their responsibilities. 
  The paper says that the Arabs have done everything to render 
the Washington talks successful. They have offered the 
establishment of a just, comprehensive, and durable genuine 
peace in the Middle East. However, Israel's response has always 
been the intensification of the settlement activity, arming of 
settlers, and urging them to commit crimes and destroy Arab 
property and houses. 
  The paper explains that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the 
subsequent events are the natural outcome of the Rabin 
government's policy of arming settlers and deploying armed 
settler patrols throughout the occupied territories. The Rabin 
government has ignored their crimes and threats to expel the 
Arabs from their homeland en masse. In the same vein, the Rabin 
government expanded settlements and allocated large funds from 
the U.S. loan guarantees to build new settlements. It also 
forced the Palestinian side to accept keeping the settlements in 
Gaza and Jericho, where they will act as hotbeds of aggression 
and a sword brandished against the Palestinians. 
  TISHRIN says that Israel is responsible for all crimes and 
for the obstruction of the Washington talks. The international 
community is dutybound to protect the Palestinian people against 
Zionist terrorism. It should compel Israel to comply with the 
requirements of peace so that peace may prevail. Such 
requirements necessitate full withdrawal by both the army and 
settlers from the occupied Arab territories. 
  For its part, AL-BA'TH stresses in a commentary that the 
campaigns of denunciation of the occupation's crimes and glaring 
hostility to peace cannot be useful unless these campaigns are 
translated into practical pressures to curb Israel's defiance of 
the international community, which is looking forward to peace 
in this region. 
  The paper says: Therefore, practical steps must be taken to 
prompt the Rabin government to declare its explicit compliance 
with the bases of the peace process, so that the bilateral talks 
may resume. The paper stresses that otherwise, the peace 
efforts will continue to revolve in a vicious circle and the 
occupation crimes will continue indefinitely. 
  AL-THAWRAH indicates that the sinful hands that shed the 
blood of our children and brothers in occupied Palestine and 
Lebanon are the same hands. Moreover, the fingers and even the 
fingerprints are the same. The paper says that even police dogs 
could trace the perpetrator and the criminal who masterminded 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the explosion at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church in Lebanon. 
  In a comment, the paper asks: Besides condemnation and 
denunciation, what will the international community do to stop 
the Zionists' crimes? What will it do to curb this racist Nazi 
Zionist ghoul? 
  The paper says that the UN Security Council has an 
opportunity now to prove that it is truly a council for 
defending the security of those who need it. The UN Security 
Council should defend the defenseless Palestinian people from 
the ferocious and horrible Israeli machine of aggression, the 
paper notes. The UN Security Council's responsibility today is 
immense, historic, crucial, and doubled. 
  The paper adds that the UN Security Council faces major 
challenges, especially with regard to safeguarding the peace 
process, at whose tables Israel is committing peace massacres 
that are not less appalling than its bloody massacres. It has a 
responsibility toward protecting the Palestinian people against 
the Zionist terrorism. The biggest responsibility and the 
biggest challenge is to safeguard the entire international 
security against the dangers of Zionism and racism, which thrive 
on rivers of blood.

has clearly manifested itself soon after the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in Hebron. 
  Commenting on this subject today, the paper says the desired 
peace is never an Israeli peace that comes at the expense of 
Arab rights and Arab existence. Peace does not mean the 
continuation of occupation and the existence of military and 
security positions and settlements. Peace is not partial 
agreements or separate deals. 
  TISHRIN says that peace is that which puts a final and total 
end to occupation and provides real circumstances and 
appropriate climates to regain the Palestinian people's 
political and national rights, including their right to 
self-determination. The paper adds that since the Oslo and 
Cairo agreements have not guaranteed these rights as much as 
they guaranteed the continuation of Israeli occupation and 
control of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and since they 
have given the occupation forces and settlers the green light to 
commit savage crimes and fascist massacres, it is only natural 
to clearly state that the partial agreements concluded between 
Israel and a Palestinian party have collapsed because the 
massacre was a natural outcome of these capitulatory agreements. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israeli terrorism is always ready 
to commit more crimes and massacres unless the international 
community, represented by the UN Security Council, shoulders its 
responsibilities and rescues our people from the Israeli killing. 
  Within the same context, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: What 
makes the tragedy of the Hebron massacre more bitter is the 
farce currently taking place at the UN Security Council. The 
Council has for over five days after the massacre and despite 
vehement global condemnation of it, failed to issue a resolution 
condemning Israel and its ugly crimes on the one hand, and 
providing protection and security to the Palestinian people on 
the other. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: This proves not only the different standards 
employed by the big powers in dealing with the world issues, 
problems, and crises, but emphasizes that the protection these 
states are providing for the Zionist entity and its terrorism in 
the occupied territories, southern Lebanon, or in what is 
related to the peace process, is keeping the region under the 
yoke of Israel's aggression. It is Israel's crimes which 
threaten regional and world peace and security.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Arab delegations have suspended bilateral talks 
in Washington to protest the massacre perpetrated at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. This stand does not mean a 
relinquishment of the objective of a just and comprehensive 
peace in the region, for the Arabs are advocates of true peace 
and their sincere efforts have not received the minimum level of 
Israeli response. The suspension of talks will not harm the 
peace talks, especially since only a few days are left before 
the conclusion of these talks. Basically, Israel wanted these 
talks to be futile. Moreover, for more than two years, these 
talks have been confronted with Israeli intransigence and 
flagrant evasions of the UN Security Council resolutions and 
their requirements. 
  We say this because no sooner had the Arab delegations 
announced the suspension of negotiations than the Tel Aviv 
rulers began to shed crocodile tears over the peace process that 
they themselves foiled. During the sixth round, the Syrian 
delegation presented an objective and balanced working paper 
that gained support from international circles. However, this 
paper received no Israeli response because it calls for full 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories in implementation 
of the U.S. initiative -- the land-for-peace formula. 
  The Syrian and Lebanese tracks did not make the desired 
progress, and the talks continued to revolve in a vicious 
circle. Israel has succeeded in pulling the Palestinian side 
out of the framework of the Washington talks and their tracks, 
and dragged it to Oslo. Following this, it proclaimed to all 
that peace has been achieved in the region, after which the 
Palestinians, who were supposed to enjoy the fruits of this 
alleged peace, woke up to see their houses and quarters 
destroyed by tank missiles, to see that the number of victims of 
Zionist terrorism has increased, and finally, to see the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the Israeli Army's serious 
escalation of killings. This Army has closed the occupied 
territories and subjugated them to military siege. 
  It is clear to the simplest observer that the peace process 
has been obstructed throughout these two years, and we can see 
no hope for the success of the peace process thanks to Israel's 
rejection of the UN Security Council resolutions, which were 
adopted as a basis for peace. These resolutions call for the 
return of all occupied Arab territories, for protection of their 
identity and history, and for a halt in the establishment of 
settlements there. 
  Israel does not want to return the land. Neither does it 
want to stop settlements. In fact, it plans to Judaize the land 
and to devour it later. All this is taking place under the 
pretext of security. The whole world has seen who is 
threatening the security of whom. Palestinians were killed 
while they were kneeling on the ground to worship God; Lebanese 
citizens were killed while they were worshipping God at the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church. None of the Arabs has ever bombed a 
synagogue, but the Israelis have never spared a mosque or a 
church. They have committed all sins and perpetrated all 
crimes. They have ripped open the abdomens of women and killed 
infants in Dayr Yasin. Genocide has always been the crux of 
their aggressive, expansionist policy. 
  The Tel Aviv rulers claim that they have taken strict 
measures against some settlers whom they call extremists. These 
measures, if they turn to be true, are confined to merely 
preventing these settlers from leaving their settlements with 
their arms. It is to be noted that such measures were taken in 
the past and they were only aimed at deluding public opinion. 
The Israeli rulers are the ones who allocated billions of 
dollars to reinforce settlements in the occupied territories. 
They have cheated the U.S Administration, and the U.S. 
Administration itself admitted this, when they used hundreds of 
millions of dollars of the loan guarantees they received, in 
violation of their commitments, to expand settlements, 
confiscate more Arab land, and expel more Arabs. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has proven that it is 
impossible 
to trust Israel's claims and agreements, and that removing and 
dismantling the settlements and expelling the settlers has 
become a basic condition for peace. Instead of shedding 
crocodile tears over the future of peace in the region, Israel's 
rulers should accept its requirements and abide by the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace 
can be achieved tomorrow if Israel withdraws from the occupied 
Arab territories. However, peace will not be achieved today, or 
tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow if Israel continues its 
course of occupation, settlement, procrastination, and 
blackmail, and of rejecting a just and comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East. 
  The UN Security Council, whose members are now discussing 
the 
massacre, will fail to perform its tasks and to assume its 
responsibilities if it does not secure protection to the 
Palestinian people and stress the need for a full and 
comprehensive Israeli withdrawal. Denunciations and 
condemnations are not sufficient to deter Israel and to prevent 
it from perpetrating new massacres, which will inevitably lead 
the region to explosion if the situation continues as it is.

that Israel is behind the Sayyidat al-Najat Church explosion in

  [Text] Commenting on the recent massacres, Hizballah Deputy 
Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim stated that political and 
human massacres cannot serve as a means to put out our nation's 
torch and weaken the nation's efforts for liberation. He said: 
If they imagine that massacres will scare us and make the 
nation retreat, they are mistaken. 
  Addressing a ceremony marking the anniversary of the birth 
of 
Imam al-Husayn and the Badr battle yesterday, Shaykh Qasim said: 
We are not only facing a plan to occupy the land of Palestine, 
but a plan to occupy the whole region. The West and its 
followers who claim to be Palestinian political leaders are 
working to take the land from its owners and perpetuate the 
usurping Israeli entity in the region. 
  He affirmed that the only response to the Israeli-U.S. plan 
is to continue the resistance so that the West and Israel will 
be unable to commit massacres in our region.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Hizballah Deputy Secretary </F>
General Shaykh Na'im Qasim by Nisrin Nasir-al-Din; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] Israeli forces continue to mass in the occupied 
strip while the enemy wages a major media campaign hinting at 
the possibility of a new military operation. While the United 
States is highlighting this atmosphere with official and public 
threats, things remain tense and the Resistance ranks are on 
constant alert. 
  So how does Hizballah view developments in the south? 
  Hizballah's Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim said 
he expects every aggression from Israel and at any time, 
regardless of whether there are any apparent or formal 
justifications. He said the Israeli threats are not new, 
because the tighter the situation Israel finds itself in, the 
harder it tries to escape it by flexing its muscle and by trying 
to use force to achieve progress in the negotiations and to 
compel those involved to make concessions. Shaykh Qasim added: 
We do not regard the Israeli threats as an exception but as 
part of the constant threat to the south, Western al-Biqa', and 
Lebanon as a whole because of the Israeli presence on our soil. 
  The U.S. stance is biased. It adopts the Israeli plan for 
the region. It is natural for the United States to propagate 
whatever Israel wants. U.S. sympathy with the threats is merely 
new proof of its collusion with Israel to prevent Lebanon and 
the region from having any dignity and to interfere more in 
imposing its policies. Another reason for the American and 
Israeli shouts is the effectiveness of the Resistance and its 
effect on complicating the schemes. We place this before all 
the nationalists and honest people so as to affirm the 
resistance option against Zionist arrogance. 
  Shaykh Qasim added: Another U.S. ploy is to urge Israel to 
remain calm. This is a known, sly way of distributing roles 
between the United States, which claims to be concerned about 
peace and security, and Israel, which violates a decision agreed 
on with Washington so that the use of force can be an additional 
weapon in subjugating the region. The United States should take 
its hands off Lebanon and the region. Israel can do nothing 
without the sponsorship of the United States, which takes care 
to ensure Israel's military superiority and supports it 
politically in international forums. Its pressures in the 
region mean that the United States is a full partner in the 
aggression and has never been a real peace partner for a single 
minute. 
  Shaykh Qasim believes that no one can guess the extent of 
the 
aggression. He ruled out the idea of an invasion because such 
an action needs the right conditions and developments that 
cannot easily be provided right now. He added that an invasion 
will cost Israel more than Lebanon because Israel would have to 
invade a people, not confront a regular army. 
  Shaykh Na'im Qasim denied reports that there had been 
contacts with Hizballah to reduce its resistance operations 
during the negotiations and stressed that no one asked us to 
reduce the operations during the Geneva summit between President 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. He said: We do not 
carry out our operations based on the negotiations, because we 
do not believe in them. Our resistance action is a constant one 
based on the principle of liberating the land. The resistance 
will continue as long as the occupation exists. It might 
intensify or weaken according to conditions on the ground but 
not according to political circumstances. 
  Asked about reports of internal party arrangements in 
preparation for a settlement, Shaykh Qasim pointed out that the 
party is basically against a settlement. We are wagering on the 
failure of that settlement, he said, adding: We believe the 
settlement involves enough complications and pressure to hinder 
many of its aspects. Failure is a possibility like all other 
possibilities. As for our internal situation, our structure 
considers every possible action under different circumstances 
based on maintaining the basic principles. There are no plans 
to rearrange the party and we believe there is no need to make 
such changes later, he emphasized. 
  Shaykh Qasim believes that talks are immobile and that no 
progress has been made along any of the tracks except the 
Palestinian 'Arafatist track. He remarked that Israel is 
confused because it believes in the need to make major 
concessions in view of the capability of the Resistance, the 
Syrian stance, and the position of the opposed Palestinian 
factions. This can embarrass Israel into making concessions. 
It is trying to avoid this because it wants to conclude 
separate deals similar to Gaza and Jericho and its appendix in 
the Cairo Agreement. Such deals would empty the various tracks 
of their meaning. Facing difficulties, particularly on the 
Syrian-Lebanese track, Israel tends to make threats of war then 
cry wolf to influence the public and thus find a justification. 
  Shaykh Na'im Qasim continued: We believe the negotiations 
are immobile. There are many obstacles and we do not know how 
they will develop. Man must occasionally monitor the situation 
to assess each phase in light of developments. But, he said, no 
matter how easy things might be, we do not believe the 
settlement will be achieved in full or that the occupation 
problem will end.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri in Beirut on 24 </F>
February--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Honorable audience, at last 
year's banquet, I said that only the state can genuinely express 
the national will of the Lebanese people. The state is above 
all, greater than all, safeguards the rights of all, and 
protects the future and unity of all Lebanese. I must 
reemphasize these points at the threshold of a historic period 
in our national life that demands we maintain the greatest 
vigilance and solidarity and anything that will spare the 
country's indulgence in petty disputes or one-upmanship. 
  Lebanon is facing internal and external challenges demanding 
the mobilization of efforts on every political, economic, and 
social level. They also demand that we reemphasize the state's 
necessary and basic role in our national society. Any future 
role by Lebanon will remain the target of containment and attack 
unless the Lebanese state--society and authority--rises to the 
level of this role, the hopes being pinned on Lebanon in the 
coming years, and the aspirations of the Lebanese, who are 
seeking progress and who strongly believe that the elements of 
progress have become stronger than the elements of anarchy and 
uncertainty. 
  I would like to emphasize the following main points: 
  1. The Lebanese state has primary responsibility for 
liberating the south and Western al-Biqa' from the Israeli 
occupation. It highlights the Lebanese people's right to use 
every means to achieve the goal of total and comprehensive 
Israeli withdrawal, the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 425, and Lebanese authority over all the occupied 
territory. Foiling Israel's attempt to undermine progress 
toward peace is a national effort in which we must all be 
involved, because the resistance of Israel is not achieved only 
with weapons. It is also achieved by political, diplomatic, and 
social means. We must choose the time and place and mobilize 
all our resources for it. We are not alone in this field. The 
fraternal Arab states led by Syria stand by us, support our 
legitimate rights, and understand our situation. The results of 
the Geneva summit between the Syrian and U.S. presidents confirm 
that we are not alone and that the Lebanese constants are 
receiving support, because they express the conviction of a 
people and the choices of a country. The friendly countries 
also hasten to assist us and respond to our wishes when we ask 
them to intervene. 
  Brothers, the delicate stage through which the Middle East, 
including Lebanon, is passing, together with the difficulties 
experienced in the Washington talks and the appearance of more 
than one trend in them, demand that the Lebanese people maintain 
their solidarity and unite their position in the face of the 
renewed Israeli ambitions. Efforts in any direction must be 
collective, not individual, objective, not random, and 
complementary, not partial, to achieve the desired results, 
utilizing all the legitimate means for an effective united 
endeavor. The responsibility is great and collective. May we 
be able to shoulder it together. God helps those who are united. 
  2. The Lebanese state is responsible for safeguarding the 
people's security and implementing the law. It will allow no 
party to usurp its role in this regard or harm the general and 
personal safety of the Lebanese. 
  3. The concurrence between the will to liberate the land 
from 
Israeli occupation and the will for development and 
reconstruction is a central policy in the process of specifying 
the role of the Lebanese state. The state that works for 
development is the state that can liberate its land from 
occupation. Development is synonymous with liberation and must 
not contradict it under any circumstance or for any reason. 
  4. The Lebanese national peace must be based on the 
principle 
of coordination with Syria and strengthening the relations 
between the two countries to fortify the Lebanese position in 
the face of regional challenges and prevent Lebanon from being 
isolated in the next stages of the developments, whether with 
regard to peace or steadfastness. [passage omitted] 
  5. Lebanon has made good progress in moving from a regime 
that handles the crisis to a regime that works to solve the 
crisis. The constitutional and legal institutions established 
as a result of the al-Ta'if Agreement are a sound national 
expression of the will for transformation, which we think there 
is urgent need to emphasize right now and in the face of any 
parties that wish to keep Lebanon swinging between crises and 
solutions. 
  6. Rebuilding the state does not begin by violating the law. 
In the face of this, we must not call for the revival of the 
state and compete to defend the democratic system and at the 
same time violate the democratic principles and laws. The just 
law of the state must prevail over all and be the judge among 
all. [passage omitted] 
  7. Balanced economic development is the principal policy 
according to which a fair country must act. It is the principal 
policy according to which we as a government act. We want our 
activity to cover all the Lebanese areas, particularly the areas 
that have historically been deprived of and isolated from state 
services and benefits. [passage omitted] 
  Honorable audience, the common denominator among all the 
points I have mentioned is the state and its role. We will be 
making a big mistake if we think that usurping one part of the 
state's role to benefit a specific party could enrich that party 
and make it stronger against other parties. I am confident that 
the state will prevail, through your will and efforts, 
irrespective of opposition by parties that feel they have been 
harmed as a result. We will maintain our policy on 
reconciliation, unity, and development. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
describes the recent statement issued by the UN Special 
Commission as a certificate of recognition in favor of Iraq and 
a slap in the face of the enemies. 
  In an article published today noting the commission's 
refutation, in a recent statement, of allegations regarding 
Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons in the marshlands, the 
paper adds: The statement issued by the UN Special Commission 
has shown the enormous misrepresentation of facts and malice 
that characterizes Van der Stoehl's statements and reports, 
which are full of falsehoods. This statement by the UN Special 
Commission has also revealed Stoehl's unjustifiable zeal. 
  The paper underscores the soundness of the clear and frank 
Iraqi position, which is designed to promote the welfare of the 
Iraqi people, protect them, and boost their quest for 
development, which is a fact acknowledged by friends and enemies 
alike. 
  The paper notes the lies promoted by Tehran and other 
covetous, hostile, and rancorous parties, which are unhappy with 
the steadfastness of the Iraqi people, saying: This is not the 
first lie, nor will it be the last. The UN Special Commission 
must examine the flood of previous lies, the truth and 
objectives of which have been exposed, and pronounce them as 
lies too. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: The allegations and fabrications made from 
time to time by some regional powers and some aggression states 
is a big unresolved hurdle that has been instrumental in 
preventing the UN Security Council from honoring its 
commitments. Meanwhile, Iraq has underlined its commitment by 
implementing UN Security Council Resolution 687. 
  The paper concludes by saying that to do Iraq justice, the 
impartial statements made must be translated into positive acts 
and deeds to remove the injustice and wrong done to it.

  [Text] The forces of the tyrant Saddam's regime are 
continuing their indiscriminate bombardment of the residential 
areas in al-'Amarah [Maysan] Governorate. This cowardly 
bombardment, which began several days ago, has set fire to and 
demolished several houses and wounded many citizens. 
  According to reports, the tyrant's regime is seeking to 
evacuate that area of its residents in an attempt to stem the 
tide of jihad operations that use the marshlands as a 
springboard. The reports add that the citizens of the area are 
facing the assault steadfastly.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Mar (INA)--The newspaper BABIL asserts 
that the UN Security Council [UNSC] resolutions on Somalia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are flagrant evidence of the deteriorating 
credibility and role of the United Nations. They are testimony 
to the immense U.S. domination of the UNSC's operating 
mechanisms and decisionmaking process. 
  In an article published today, the paper adds: The U.S. 
moves to obstruct the passage of a resolution condemning the 
Zionist entity and authorizing the deployment of international 
observers in the occupied Arab territories to protect the 
Palestinians show the immense U.S. domination of the world body 
and the UNSC, and demonstrate the urgent need to restore balance 
to the UNSC-- something impossible to achieve as long as the 
UNSC remains hostage to U.S. wishes. 
  BABIL goes on to say: The U.S. treatment of the UNSC is a 
clear message to all those who expect the "cosponsors of the 
conference" to find a solution to the Palestinian people's 
ordeal. For the judge is the very culprit, whose hands are 
stained with the blood of our people in both Iraq and Palestine. 
  BABIL recalls the rapidity with which the UNSC passed its 
anti-Iraq resolutions in August 1990, when it passed three 
resolutions in a single week. Together, these resolutions 
contained 18 paragraphs, the implementation of which is 
mandatory. 
  The paper concludes by saying: This is how the United States 
handled the Iraq issue and pushed the UNSC to pass a series of 
unfair resolutions in an unprecedented manner.

  [Text] Nicosia, Feb 24 (AFP)--Three explosions rocked the 
centre of Karkuk in northern Iraq, but there were no casualties, 
the Iraqi opposition said Thursday. 
  In a statement received in Cyprus, the Iraqi National 
Congress (INC), an alliance of opposition groups, said the 
blasts occurred early Tuesday outside an army headquarters, a 
state-run oil company building and near a giant portrait of 
President Saddam Husayn painted on a wall. 
  The INC is based in Salah al-Din, in Kurdish-controlled 
northern Iraq. 
  Karkuk, an important oil city with nearly one million 
inhabitants, is near the Kurdish-held areas.

  [Text] Baghdad, 2 Mar (INA)--The towns and villages of the 
Autonomous Region of Kurdistan are witnessing immense and 
massive indignation due insecurity and instability, increasing 
crime, and deteriorating living conditions. 
  The newspaper AL-'IRAQ reported today that the people of 
Rawandoz in the Irbil Governorate recently staged demonstrations 
to express their resentment and to protest their deteriorating 
living conditions. They also protested their intense suffering 
as a result of the services, administrative, and health problems 
they have been experiencing for the past two years due to the 
corruption of the agent and subversive cliques and their theft 
of the economic, health, and service infrastructures in the 
Kurdistan region, which were built by the 17-30 July revolution. 
  The paper said that the demonstrators chanted slogans about 
the Kurds' poverty and inability to obtain their food 
requirements, saying: "We want bread. We want freedom." This 
prompted the agent and subversive cliques to open fire on the 
demonstrators to frighten and disperse them, the paper added.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Jordanian newspapers have for the second 
day continued to extensively highlight various local, Arab, and 
world reactions to the 25 February massacre at the Hebron 
Ibrahimi Mosque. Statements made by various Jordanian and 
Palestinian parties and organizations are either reported or 
published in full. Condemnation of the massacre is overwhelming 
and most published statements call on the Palestinians and Arabs 
to pull out of the Arab-Israeli talks. Some call for jihad and 
revival of armed struggle while others call for retribution and 
revenge. 
  A statement by the "popular and political key figures" in 
the 
al-Tafilah Governorate, published as an advertisement on page 38 
of the 27 February issue of Amman AL-RA'Y in Arabic and signed 
by four Jordanian parties and six al-Tafilah unions and 
societies reads in part: 
  "At a time when the Arab regimes and the leadership 
dominating the PLO are bargaining over Palestine, presenting it 
to the Jews as an easy morsel through the conferences of 
capitulation, the ugliest of crimes of murder, imprisonment, 
banishment, and displacement are being perpetrated against our 
people and brothers in Palestine. 
  "The crime perpetrated by the spiteful Zionist gangs against 
the sons of our people in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, in 
which approximately 400 Muslims were martyred or wounded, 
confirms the criminal nature of these gangs -- the sons of 
monkeys and pigs. In the name of the popular figures and 
political parties in the al-Tafilah Governorate, which rejected 
and continue to reject the policies of capitulation to the 
Zionist entity, demand an end to the current negotiations with 
the enemy on all levels and the adoption of jihad and struggle 
for the liberation of Arab Palestine." 
  The advertisement is signed by the Islamic Action Front, the 
Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian People's 
Democratic Party, the Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
al-Tafilah Cultural and Sports Club, al-Tafilah branch of the 
Engineers Union, al-Tafilah Charity Society, al-Harith 
Bin-'Umayr al-Azdi Society, al-Tafilah branch of the Jordanian 
Red Crescent Society, and al-Tafilah branch of the National 
Union of Jordanian Youth. 
  A statement by the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, published 
within a report on other reactions on page 12 of the 27 February 
issue of Amman AL-DUSTUR in Arabic says: "We in the Muslim 
Brotherhood emphasize that the Hebron massacre, along with the 
outcome of negotiations in Cairo and Taba where there is full 
capitulation to the Zionists, confirm the course in which our 
movement has always believed; namely, the escalation of armed 
struggle and all forms of resistance against occupation as the 
only option for the restoration of the usurped rights. Hence, 
we call on the PLO and all the Arab states, particularly Jordan, 
to immediately withdraw from the negotiations. We call on the 
PLO to return to the option of resistance and armed struggle and 
abandon the course of negotiations and concessions which left 
nothing else to cede and which will open the door for the 
Zionists to enter our Arab capitals to consecrate the state of 
usurpation that is dominating the entire region. 
  While urging the masses of our Palestinian people and their 
struggling forces, headed by the Islamic Resistance Movement, 
Hamas, and its mujahid battalions to burn the ground under the 
feet of the occupiers, we stress the need for the solidarity of 
all sectors of our people and nation outside with their brother 
mujahidin on the land of al-Isra' [Palestine]. We also call on 
all popular, Islamic, and national bodies in the Islamic states 
to express their indignation and denunciation of the appalling 
crime. We also call for a continuous drive to raise funds for 
the mujahidin in the territories to be undertaken by the Islamic 
movements and popular forces in these states." 
  A statement by the Jordanian Democratic Arab Islamic 
Movement 
Party, published within the same report, but on page 13 of the 
same issue of AL-DUSTUR calls for suspending negotiations with 
"the Zionist enemy" and for holding an Arab summit conference in 
Mecca during the next hajj season to boost Arab ties and draw up 
a unified Arab strategy to extend unlimited support for the 
people in the occupied territories and "reactivate national 
struggle and jihad against the usurping enemy there." 
  A boxed statement published on page 15 of the 27 February 
AL-DUSTUR reads as follows: "Urgent Appeal to Our Mujahid 
Battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and to All Armed Groups of 
All Palestinian Factions: Hamas calls on its jihad 
battalions--the heroic battalions of 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam and 
all armed and military groups of the Palestinian factions to 
reply and in the strongest possible manner to the ugly massacre 
and avenge our righteous martyrs. 
  "Let all operating units in the mujahid al-Qassam battalions 
and all struggling groups be placed on maximum alert and a state 
of emergency be declared. Let urgent military plans be drawn up 
to strike at the Zionist targets, the occupation troops, and the 
hordes of settlers. 
  "Let today and all coming days be days of violent revenge 
and 
decisive reply to the ugly crime. 
  "God is greater than the machinations of the aggressor. 
  "Friday, 15 Ramadan 1414 Hegira, corresponding to 25 
February 
1994. 
  "The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, Palestine, the 
Information Bureau."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Ibrahimi Mosque's Massacre Emphasizes That </F>
Coexistence Between Arabs and Settlers Is Impossible"] 
  [Text] The heinous crime the Jews committed in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque against Muslims while prostrating in their prayers 
recalls to the mind the Jews' treachery, black hatred, and ugly 
crimes throughout ancient and modern history against our Arab 
nation. 
  The massacre, in which scores of Arab citizens were martyred 
and hundreds were injured, was certainly carried out at the 
instructions, or at least with the knowledge, of Rabin's 
government. 
  How can an extremist settler, carrying a machine gun, enter 
a 
mosque while scores of soldiers are there to watch those who 
enter or leave the mosque? 
  This heinous crime, which reflects the treachery of Jews and 
proves their hidden hatred, will certainly influence the course 
of peace process Israel tried, and is trying, to abort. 
  This ugly massacre, which is considered a blatant violation 
of international laws and charters and human rights, and which 
conflicts with religious and moral values, should not pass 
without punishment for all those who were behind it and who 
paved the way for its implementation. 
  Palestinians and Arabs should not be satisfied with issuing 
statements of condemnation and denunciation, and with weeping 
and wailing about the martyrs. They should seriously and 
responsibly reassess this situation and this tragedy and 
disaster. 
  Palestinians and Arabs -- peoples and leaders -- should 
reconsider their calculations and their position on the peace 
process as a whole. 
  It has been proven that there will be no coexistence between 
the Jews and Arabs as long as the Jewish settlements remain in 
the heart of Gaza and the West Bank. It has been proven that 
the region will not enjoy real, lasting, just, and comprehensive 
peace without israel's full withdrawal from all occupied 
Palestinian and Arab territories, immediately and without any 
delay. 
  This massacre, which is a shame for humanity, and for which 
the whole international community is responsible, should drive 
the big and influential powers in the Security Council, led by 
the United States, and before them all the Arab countries, to 
take a firm position toward Israel and its aggressive and 
expansionist policy that threatens security, stability, and 
peace in the whole region. 
  It should urge the big and influential powers of the 
Security 
Council to send international forces to protect the Islamic and 
Christian shrines and Arab citizens in occupied Palestinian and 
Arab territories. They should force Israel to immediately 
withdraw from these territories. Short of this, the peace 
process will be destined to complete failure. 
  We in steadfast Jordan urge all Arab leaders to overcome 
their differences, revive Arab solidarity, and close and unify 
ranks to defend the Arab and Islamic shrines and our kinsfolk in 
the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Massacre Seeds in Israel"] </F>
  [Text] The massacre that was heinously perpetrated against 
Palestinians praying peacefully in Hebron's Haram al-Ibrahimi 
yesterday is on the scale of the Feb.6 Sarajevo bombing that led 
NATO and the U.N. to move finally to curb the criminal 
activities of the Bosnian Serbs. As such, mere condemnation of 
the ugly crime will not do. The international community has to 
show resolve and vision in this part of the world too. But 
first it has to agree on the folly of keeping Jewish settlers in 
the midst of the Arab communities in the occupied territories. 
By placing Jewish zealots literally on the back of the 
Palestinians, the Israeli governments, past and present, have 
become accomplices in the latest manifestation of hatred against 
Arabs. 
  There is every possibility that the massacre will draw 
violent reactions by the Palestinians, which would add to the 
cycle of violence, undermining in the process the entire peace 
effort. While a halt to Arab-Israeli negotiations should not be 
brought about by any violent act, regardless of how outrageous 
and wherever it comes from, the Israeli government nevertheless 
is duty-bound to take a number of immediate measures to help 
heal the deep wounds that yesterday's ugly massacre has 
inflicted on Arab and Muslim hearts and other human beings 
everywhere. The Israeli authorities should not content 
themselves with a thorough investigation of how the alleged 
killer got into the mosque and was able "single-handedly" to 
murder so many people at once. Israeli also has to release 
details of the truth of what happened and to reveal the full 
extent of any plot that may have well been hatched by more than 
the "lone" man in "mental crisis" who fired the shots. 
  But beyond that, the Labour-led government of Yitzhaq Rabin 
has to outlaw extremist groups among the settlers and has to 
begin today the process of disarming them in a prelude to taking 
all neo-colonialists inside the "green line." Those settlers 
who want to leave the occupied territories have to be encouraged 
to do so. Prime Minister Rabin cannot procrastinate on this for 
tactical or any other reasons; and certainly those fanatic Jews 
who live with their arms and destructive ideology in Arab cities 
and towns, like Hebron, have to be evicted right away. 
  There will be many questions on how the "lone" settler got 
into the mosque fully armed, started and continued shooting for 
several long minutes, without the Israeli army coming to the 
rescue of the helpless victims. There will be other questions 
on how the Israeli authorities provided or failed to provide 
timely medical assistance to the wounded, why they rejected all 
pleas for lifting the curfew against Hebron and troops went on 
to kill 10 more Palestinians on the streets of the occupied 
territories shortly after the massacre. 
  The settlers cannot be allowed to go on the rampage in Arab 
towns and villages, erect barricades and block roads, humiliate 
young and elderly Arabs under the eyes and nose of the Israeli 
Army. If this situation continues to prevail, the cycle of 
violence will continue and can ultimately derail the whole peace 
process, unless of course the Rabin government acts firmly and 
fast to save the historic reconciliation that was started in 
Washington on Sept. 13. 
  The seeds of yesterday's massacre were planted long ago when 
the Israelis brought in the settlers, the majority of whom are 
fanatics and religious zealots, armed them and in many cases 
unleashed them against the people of the West Bank and Gaza. 
The laxity and the carrot-only policy which the Israeli 
security forces have been pursuing with the settlers was bound 
to result in the kind of lawlessness and extremist acts that we 
witnessed yesterday. 
  Everything now depends on the way the Israeli government 
handles the aftermath of the gross and terrorist act at Haram 
al-Ibrahimi. The international community can help heal the 
wounds, but only if it brings pressure to bear on the Israelis 
to do what is right.

<F P=106> [By Barry Parker] </F>
  JERUSALEM, March 1 (AFP) - Israel released about 500 
Palestinians on Tuesday [1 March] in a bid to calm the fury 
ignited by the Hebron massacre, but Palestinians warned that 
much more will be needed before Middle East peace talks resume. 
  Military officials said there would be further releases 
Wednesday and a total of up to 500 by the end of the week. 
  However former Palestinian spokesman Hanan 'Ashrawi 
dismissed 
the gesture as window-dressing when more than 10,000 
Palestinians are in Israeli jails. 
  "We are not looking for appearance we are looking for 
serious 
substance," she said. 
  None of those released killed or wounded Israelis, none 
belonged to groups opposed to peace such as Hamas and none had 
committed crimes since the September 13 autonomy deal. 
  "These releases are just a drop in the ocean without any 
political significance," said 27-year-old Nasir 'Azzah who was 
bussed back home to Ramallah on the occupied West Bank just 11 
days before he completed a 21-month sentence. 
  "I'm not as happy as saddened and angered by the massacre in 
Hebron. Releasing 1,000 prisoners is not enough," said Ihsan 
'Awdah, 25, who returned home to Bethlehem six months before the 
end of five years inside. 
  The carnage at the Tomb of the Patriarchs on Friday sparked 
widespread rioting which has left another 17 Arabs dead and 
hundreds wounded and Palestinian leaders ordered no celebrations 
for the releases. 
  It has also led the PLO, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon to snub 
US 
President Bill Clinton's call for snap talks to turn tragedy 
into a peace catalyst. 
  Sufyan 'Abu-Zaydah, a senior Gaza Strip official with 
Arafat's Fatah movement, said: "It's too small a number. There 
are at least 4,000 prisoners in jail on ridiculous charges. 
  "Israel could free them immediately to calm the Palestinian 
population." 
  According to international human rights groups Israel 
detains 
about 500 Palestinians a week during normal times. 
  Abu-Zaydah said the release of large numbers of inmates was 
"the only way to appease the population of the occupied 
territories". 
  But violence in the territories and Arab areas of Israel 
subsided with more than half of the two million Palestinians 
still under curfew. Troops shot six Palestinians in Gaza City 
on Tuesday compared with dozens in preceding days. 
  Israel nonetheless reinforced patrols in the territories and 
along the borders, fearing attacks. Army chief of staff Ehud 
Baraq said the army was bracing for a wave of revenge attacks. 
  Pro-Israeli militia forces killed four Islamic guerrillas in 
southern Lebanon. 
  The prison release -- a few days ahead of the annual 
liberation of a few hundred Palestinians to mark the end of the 
fasting month of Ramadan -- was part of a package of measures 
announced Sunday. 
  They included a crackdown on hardline settlers who supported 
the mosque killer Barukh Goldstein, but the PLO rejected them as 
inadequate. 
  Police Minister Moshe Shahal vowed that four Jewish 
extremist 
ringleaders who backed the massacre, would be hunted down and 
detained without trial. 
  He said the killing of 30 Moslems according to the army and 
52 according to Palestinian doctors, had crossed a "red line". 
  Leaders of the anti-Arab Kach and Kahana Hay groups, with 
which the killer had close links, went underground as the 
government ordered their arrest. Only one was caught in a 
police swoop. 
  Shahal said "a few dozen" members of the movements would be 
disarmed and their movements restricted. Kach membership was 
below 100 and Kahana Hay even smaller, he said. 
  The government also announced multi-million shekel (one 
dollar is worth three shekels) compensation to relatives of the 
dead and wounded. 
  It was the third release since the September agreement. Some 
617 were allowed out on October 26 and on January 7, another 101 
Palestinians walked free, most just a few days before the end of 
their time. 
  The last 200 of 415 Palestinian fundamentalists deported on 
December 17, 1992, were also brought back a year later.

  [Excerpts] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert this morning told 
the Presidents Conference of Major American Jewish Organizations 
that Israel should not stall the political process, but neither 
should it offer political concessions to renew the talks that 
are beyond the scope of what the government planned. Such 
concessions would mean a sellout of the vital interests of the 
State of Israel. 
  Referring to the possibility that Yasir 'Arafat would be 
allowed to pray at the Temple Mount in the presence of 250,000 
Muslims during Friday prayers, Olmert had this to say: 
  [Begin Olmert recording] Bringing 'Arafat into the Temple 
Mount on Friday afternoon is the upset of every balance that 
exists in Jerusalem, and it may end up with a greater massacre. 
Remember my words! Because then someone will ask how dumb they 
were not to understand it. So I am warning in advance: It will 
end up with a greater massacre, no matter why, no matter how. 
At the end of the day, there will be greater number of 
casualties than in the massacre in Hebron, and everyone will 
come and say: How dumb we were not to understand it in advance. 
[end recording] 
  Olmert also said he would work to equalize the rights of 
Jews 
and Arabs in the municipal plane, and he was appointing an East 
Jerusalem headmaster to act as head of the Arab school education 
in that part of the city.

conducted by the IDF among the wounded and the families of the 
victims of the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre indicates that 30 
worshipers were killed by the shots fired by Dr. Barukh 
Goldstein in the cave itself, four Palestinians were killed near 
the al-Ahali hospital, and another man was killed in a 
neighborhood near the Cave of the Patriarchs. Our correspondent 
Yo'el Nir reports that according to Gen. Yatom, these figures 
are not final but are based on the information available as of 
last night. The number of people wounded is still being 
examined. Gen. Yatom added that he has worked out new 
procedures governing prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs but 
has not submitted them to the political echelon yet. 
  Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq told the committee that the 
newspapers published a list of names of 47 people killed in the 
massacre. An examination of this list, however, showed that 
several of the persons on it are still alive and that some were 
only wounded. The list also includes some inaccurate names. 
The chief of staff believes this is the reason for the gap 
between the various calculations.

  [Text] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur has said that 
no one in the defense establishment had anticipated that a man 
would get up and do what the murderer Goldstein did. We were 
taken by surprise, the deputy minister admitted. Our 
correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that, speaking before the 
Knesset plenum, Deputy Minister Gur said that very harsh steps 
will be taken against the supporters of Kakh. At the same time, 
however, the administration will attempt to avoid discrediting 
all of the Jewish settlers in the territories. 
  Our correspondent reports that the Knesset debate was very 
stormy. Knesset Members [MK's] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and 
Rehav'am Ze'evi called each other terrorist and murderer, and 
other MK's rushed to separate the two rivals. 
  Deputy Minister Gur pleaded with the Arab MK's to go back 
on, 
and refrain from making statements linking the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] with Barukh Goldstein's shooting. Such claims 
are blood libel, Gur said.

that no telegram was received by the office from the head of the 
Supreme Muslim Council in Jerusalem and the head of the Waqf in 
Hebron containing a complaint about Barukh Goldstein, the Hebron

  Meretz Knesset member 'Anat Ma'or today presented the 
telegram in which the two complain that more than four months 
ago Goldstein attacked the muezzin in the mosque in the Cave of

<F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: "A </F>
Change of Venue Will Not Help"] 
  [Text] It is a pity that the mandate given to the state 
commission of inquiry does not extend beyond Israel's borders. 
If Justice Me'ir Shamgar and his colleagues were permitted to 
travel as far as the United States, it is doubtful that they 
would exonerate Secretary of State Warren Christopher -- or even 
President Bill Clinton -- from responsibility for the fiasco. 
The Americans are very fastidious. They meticulously word and 
file everything away. It would not even be necessary to dig up 
secret files. 
  The exploits of the settlers were cited in this year's State 
Department annual human rights report. The investigators would 
find that the CIA's agents in Israel repeatedly reported on the 
evil deeds of the Kahanists from Brooklyn. And, if he had a hard 
time reading overt and covert material, Christopher could have 
heard about it from Palestinian leaders. This, of course, 
unless he fell asleep, as he did during Clinton's speech in 
Brussels and his latest meeting with Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. 
  Old hands at the State Department cannot remember such a 
lethargic, bureaucratic, and hesitant secretary. Asked to 
comment about the fate of the occupied territories, he would 
have a ready-made answer: The peace process, and the process 
alone, is the solution. And what did the secretary contribute 
to that process? Twice a week he would grovel before Jewish 
functionaries and promise not to put pressure on Israel, God 
forbid. 
  The U.S. team includes a handful of dedicated officials who 
witnessed the birth of the peace process and are eager to hold 
the baby in their arms. The secretary reined in anybody who 
asked permission to intervene in the negotiations, lest this be 
interpreted as a provocation of the Rabin government. 
  The Jewish leadership, which has not yet shaken loose of the 
Likud's grip, knows why it prefers Christopher and has gone to 
great lengths to stand in Strobe Talbott's way to the secretary 
of state's office. Talbott's articles in TIME show that his 
views about the damage caused by the settlements in particular 
and the occupation in general are very close to those of Peres 
and Yosi Beilin. Prior to the Oslo agreement, I heard Peres 
speak in favor of working intensively on a permanent arrangement 
(a confederation) and skipping the interim stage. Why pay 
twice, he asked time and again. During his visit to Washington, 
Beilin publicly stated that he would forego the autonomy stage. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin apparently exhausted his ability to be dragged 
by the Foreign Ministry duo when he signed the Oslo agreement, 
and there is no way they can drag him into a debate about the 
future of the settlements/provocations. Since 13 September, 
Peres and Beilin have been asking the Americans to take action, 
particularly on the Syrian arena, but also on the Palestinian 
track. People who know Rabin know that if there is anything he 
idolizes, fears, and respects it is Washington. 
  If the United States had a President who could see reality 
beyond the level of crime in Chicago, he would ask the prime 
minister -- to cite just one example -- to tell him how he 
intends to deal with criminals armed with government-issued 
weapons who openly declare their intention to kill Palestinian 
policemen. After all, Clinton was asked to be the best man at 
the signing ceremony of the Oslo agreement. Since then, he has 
missed no opportunity, particularly in domestic political 
events, to boast about this feat. He must have reached the 
conclusion that a strong police force in Chicago would improve 
his chances of getting reelected. This is much more important 
to him than a Palestinian police force and Jewish criminals, or 
vice versa. 
  A month and a half ago, through his meeting with Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad, Clinton made his most active 
contribution to the peace process. What came out of it? 
Another one or two -- who is counting? -- rounds of sterile 
talks in Washington. Everybody patted themselves in the back 
about the "businesslike atmosphere" achieved by cutting down the 
size of the delegations and the frequency of press briefings -- 
some contribution by the only superpower in the world to the 
peace process. 
  One should not infer from this weakness that the country 
that 
put a man on the moon had no people who could read the writing 
on the wall. Appearing before a Jewish convention, Dennis Ross, 
the head of the U.S. peace team, warned that long intervals in 
the negotiations on the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles between Israel and the PLO might jeopardize the 
process. His remarks cast the heads of the U.S. Administration 
in a grimmer light when one considers that he and his colleagues 
supposedly said the same things to their superiors. 
  Even now that the President has invited Israel and the PLO 
to 
Washington, it is hard to discern a substantial change in the 
way it perceives the problems and their solution. For 
convenience's sake -- in other words, for fear of upsetting the 
Jews -- the focus remains on matters of procedure and venue. 
The logic behind this passive approach is that the peace 
process itself will improve the atmosphere in the area. The 
massacre in Hebron made abundantly clear that what we have here 
is a question of ideology, which is becoming more acute as the 
peace process advances toward a compromise solution. 
  The only remedy to such an ideology is resoluteness and 
firmness. A change of venue will not change fortunes. Jimmy 
Carter did not overcome the ideologist Menahem Begin thanks to 
the fresh air at Camp David, but thanks to his arm-wrestling 
tactics and the negotiating methods used by a superpower with a 
protege. 
  Bill Clinton shares responsibility for the tragedy in Hebron 
and its aftermath. If he does not bring up the problem of the 
settlements with Yitzhaq Rabin, the Middle East will join his 
other failures in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and apparently, 
Russia. It is very doubtful that when the day comes, the Jews, 
whom he fears so much, will thank him for this failure.

  [Text] Mike Guzofsky, spokesman of the U.S. chapter of the 
Kahana Hay movement, says that if the Israeli Government outlaws 
the movement, it should not be surprised later if the Kahana 
followers act undemocratically. In an interview with Qobi 
Meydan today, Guzofsky said the present government and Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin should be toppled. 
  [Begin recording] [Guzofsky] Support should be mustered for 
the removal of Yitzhaq Rabin from government. Definitely. 
  [Meydan] You do not rule out the physical option. 
  [Guzofsky] I do not know what you mean by physical: Putting 
a bullet in his head? Is that what you mean? 
  [Meydan] I was just asking. 
  [Guzofsky] You were just asking. I think that, so far, the 
actions of Kahana Hay in Israel, the United States, and 
throughout the world have been within the law. In Israel, the 
rules are different because Yitzhaq Rabin and the fools in 
government are preventing Kahana Hay and Kakh from operating 
legally and democratically. So they should not be surprised 
afterward. 
  [Meydan] Do I hear a threat? 
  [Guzofsky] I did not make a threat. I am merely saying that 
when a regime prevents its people from electing freely and when 
it prevents the Kahana Hay and Kakh people from being elected, 
they should not ask afterward why we act undemocratically. [end

orders are signed by the commander of the Central Command. 
Orders were also issued yesterday to seven Samaria settlers, 
restricting their movements in Arab population centers, 
including Nabulus. Among those who received the orders are four 
settlers from Kfar Tapuah, including Binyamin Kahana. Two 
others are from the settlement of Yitzhar in Samaria. According 
to the order, the weapons of the seven will be confiscated. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 2 March on page A1, in a

what they term the government's witch hunt against them. 
  David Axelrod, the Kahana Hay spokesman who resides in Kfar 
Tapuah, told our correspondent Gil Litman that yesterday he 
received an order restricting his movements and banning him from 
entering Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. He was also ordered to return 
his army-issued weapon to the IDF. Axelrod told our 
correspondent he will not obey the two orders and that he 
intends to come to Qiryat Arba' in order to visit the grave of 
Barukh Goldstein. Axelrod claims he should keep his weapon for 
self-defense purposes.

and Rafah. Nine residents were lightly injured. Eighteen 
firebombs were hurled at IDF troops in the Gaza Strip today. 
There were no casualties. Ten explosive charges were also 
discovered and safely dismantled. Gaza City and the nearby 
refugee camps remain under curfew. The IDF has up till now 
refrained from clamping a curfew on the southern part of the 
Gaza Strip despite the disturbances which have continued since 
last Friday [25 February].

  [Text] At least one Hebron resident was killed by Army 
fire and 14 wounded in fierce clashes in the town this morning. 
There was also renewed violence in the Gaza Strip. Mark Weiss 
reports: 
  The clashes at various locations in Hebron erupted this 
morning after the Army announced a two-hour lifting of the 
curfew to enable residents to stock up on basic supplies. 
Hundreds of residents joined the violent protests, and 
17-year-old Usamah Mustafa Ghazal was shot and killed by Army 
fire, and at least another 14 were wounded, two of them 
seriously. Witnesses report that a second resident, 18-year-old 
Nidal al-Hammumi, has also died of his wounds, but this has 
still not been confirmed by hospital sources. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 2 March 
reports: "In Jericho, soldiers shot and killed 'Uthman 'Ali 
Bargham, 20, and wounded 22 local residents in the most violent 
riots the city has experienced in many years." The report adds 
that "several masked men incited the masses in a mourning 
procession in the city today. The marchers began to riot, 
attacking the police station, at which point the troops were 
forced to open fire."] 
  Clashes continued in Gaza city and the refugee camp of 
Jabalyah this morning. At least 20 residents were wounded, 
according to Palestinian sources. The curfews in towns and 
refugee camps in the Gaza Strip were lifted today, although the 
schools remained closed. 
  The closure imposed following the Hebron massacre remains in 
force. The curfews on major population centers in the West Bank 
remain in place, although there are frequent reports of curfew 
breaking and isolated clashes with troops. 
  Two border policemen were lightly wounded in stone-throwing 
clashes today, one in Ramallah and one in Gaza.

  [Excerpt] Israel will be asking the United States to 
broaden the terms for the use of the U.S. loan guarantees in 
order to finance the building of a security infrastructure 
beyond the Green Line. Among other things, the money would be 
used to build new roads in the aftermath of the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] redeployment after the withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho. The use of the guarantees will be discussed in Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meetings with the heads of the U.S. 
Administration during his upcoming trip to the United States.

  [Excerpts] Damascus has issued exit visas to all the 1,000 
Jews who remained in Syria, and they are now allowed to leave 
the country if they so wish, Yosef Jatti, the deputy chief rabbi 
of Syria, stated yesterday. 
  Diplomats said this was yet another gesture of good will on 
the part of the Syrian Government in a bid to improve its 
relations with the United States and promote the peace process 
in the Middle East. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated yesterday that Israel 
still needs a gesture on the part of the Syrian president that 
will prove the seriousness of his intentions with regard to 
peace. 
  "If we are talking about confidence-building measures, then 
these measures are too small to build the necessary confidence," 
Peres commented yesterday. 
  "The release of Jews or the willingness to issue them 
passports are nothing new. We would like to see something more 
serious, along the lines of a public declaration such as: `I 
want to make peace with Israel,' as al-Sadat did; or conversely, 
a visit to Israel or public negotiations on all levels," Peres 
said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Uzi Mahanaymi] </F>
  [Text] The first tentative moves toward an Israeli-Iraqi 
connection were made in Europe by Middle Eastern and European 
elements over the past few weeks. These were merely preliminary 
contacts, but it has been learned that President Saddam Husayn 
did not reject the initiative out of hand. The elements 
apprised the Iraqi top echelons and a senior Israeli official of 
the situation. 
  The objective of the contacts is to set up a secret 
negotiating track with the Iraqis in a bid to include Iraq in 
the peace process. If the preliminary mediation goes well, the 
elements will arrange a first, clandestine meeting between 
Israeli and Iraqi elements in the not-too-distant future, to be 
held in the presence of the Middle Eastern and European 
middlemen. 
  The initiative was conceived jointly as a result of the 
various interests of the pertinent elements. The European 
interest is to rescue Iraq from the embargo. They believe this 
will best be achieved through Iraqi contacts with Israelis. 
They believe such contacts may assuage the United States' anger 
at Saddam Husayn. The motive here is neither the peace process 
nor concern for Iraq, but rather a purely economic interest on 
the part of the European country that initiated the mediation. 
  The Arab element's motivation lies in the assessment that 
only Iraq's incorporation into the peace process will exert 
dramatic pressure on Syria to engage in an accelerated process 
and get the peace process moving. 
  The European/Middle Eastern initiative was keenly received 
in 
Iraq. Elements close to the Iraqi top echelons have for some 
time noticed a subtle, almost imperceptible change in the 
attitude toward Israel. About a year after the war, it was 
learned that several of Saddam Husayn's advisers had suggested 
that he publicly recognize Israel as the only way out of the 
embargo, which was crippling Iraq. The idea, to which Saddam 
Husayn was cautiously introduced, seemed to enjoy the support of 
Tariq 'Aziz and Nizar Hamdun, the ambassador to the United 
Nations. The two men conveyed their suggestion separately via 
the president's relatives rather than directly to Saddam: 
Hamdun made his suggestion through Quza'i, the president's son, 
and 'Aziz made his through another relative. 
  As far as is known, Saddam categorically rejected the idea 
of 
recognizing Israel. Last year, Hamdun made another attempt, 
which also failed. By the way, Hamdun has never hesitated to 
admit in private conversations that he supports Israel. 
  A certain shift took place in September, immediately after 
the Yitzhaq Rabin-Yasir 'Arafat handshake. Faruq Qaddumi, who 
was the PLO foreign minister until then, opposed the agreement 
and was replaced in Washington by Mahmud 'Abbas, alias 
Abu-Mazin. The frustrated Qaddumi flew to Baghdad to raise 
support for his opposition to the process. There were rumors 
that a new, Iraq-supported PLO would be established. To 
Qaddumi's great surprise, not only did Saddam withhold his 
congratulations for Qaddumi's opposition to the process, but he 
received him with curses and profanities and sent him back to 
Tunis without any support, either declaratory or financial. 
  A short time later, the Iraqi president relayed a message 
to 'Arafat saying that "Iraq supports the path chosen by its 
Palestinian brothers." Some claim that this seemingly 
surprising stand was the Iraqi president's way to repay 'Arafat 
for his sweeping support during the Gulf war. Other people, 
those who are familiar with the goings-on in Saddam's kitchen, 
believe that pragmatism, not gratitude, prompted the 
declaration. When Saddam said he was launching missiles at 
Israel on behalf of the Palestinians, he meant just that. When 
he said he supported the Palestinian peace process, he meant 
that, too, although he is still unwilling to announce it in 
public, primarily for domestic reasons. 
  With or without Saddam, Iraq will be unable to remain on the 
fringes of the peace process for long. It shares no border with 
Israel, and the Palestinian problem was and is the heart of the 
conflict. With this problem on the verge of a solution -- be it 
quick or sluggish -- the main cause for Iraq's hostility toward 
Israel is also disappearing. 
  The paradox is that the disappearance -- or at least the 
reduction -- of the Palestinian problem has caused Syria, the 
northwestern neighbor, to emerge as Iraq's real enemy. Both 
Baghdad and Damascus are ruled by the Ba'th Party, the 
brainchild of Zaki al-Arsuzi. Distinct brands of this party 
developed in the two capitals, and for many years now the 
parties, which derived from similar platforms, have been 
antagonistic toward each other. The Iraqis will not allow the 
Syrians to play first violin in the new Middle East orchestra 
that is performing to the tune of the new world order directed 
by Washington. 
  Iraq's opening conditions in its contest with Syria over 
Washington's heart are almost impossible, but Iraq is not giving 
in. The Iraqi intellectuals' exposure to the West cannot be 
compared with that of the Syrians. Members of the Iraqi 
academic community are known in the best universities around the 
world, while Syria faces the West approximately like Albania of 
the previous decade. The political opening conditions are 
disadvantageous to the Iraqis. The other opening conditions -- 
academic, diplomatic, and economic -- are all advantageous to 
the Iraqis. Baghdad is now trying to find a crack to insert a 
foot that will open the American steel door that has locked Iraq 
out. 
  Resorting to Israel as a way of opening this door is not the 
worst idea heard in Baghdad. For their part, the Syrians are 
aware of the possibility of a surprise from that direction. 
Knowledgeable sources believe that this is the true reason for 
President al-Asad's uncharacteristic restlessness and the sense 
of urgency he communicated in his meeting with U.S. President 
Clinton last month. 
  The Syrian president can live with a stable Israeli-PLO 
arrangement. A year ago, he even said as much to journalist 
Patrick Seal. Iraqi recognition of Israel would be a pill too 
bitter for al-Asad to swallow. It would mean that in the 
contest between the two countries to win over the United States, 
Iraq would have beaten Syria, Iraq would be exculpated, and that 
overnight, Iraq would become the leading country in the Arab 
world, together with Egypt, and certainly the leading country in 
the region once called the Fertile Crescent. 
  Since he rose to power in June 1992, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin has been "accused" several times of playing a 
divide-and-rule game with Syria and the Palestinians. That may 
have been his tactic, but it is doubtful. To make such complex 
moves vis-a-vis the Arabs requires exhaustive familiarity with 
the map of Palestinian and Syrian power components. The prime 
minister is not conversant with it, and no one in his 
surroundings is capable of providing him with sufficient 
professional counseling on this matter -- not even Uri Sagi, 
head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, or 
the former Intelligence Branch heads, Shahaq and Baraq. 
  The real barrier is between Syria and Iraq and not Syria and 
the Palestinians. As in spheres unrelated to politics, the 
divide-and-rule tactic is short-lived and liable to backfire 
against the one who employs it. The Israeli approach to Iraq 
should be on the strategic level, which dictates the urgency of 
the Israeli need to reach rapid reconciliation with the Iraqis. 
  Two camps have long existed in Israel: the Iraqi camp and 
the Iranian camp. Leading elements in Israeli political, 
economic, and academic life have advocated alliances with either 
the Iraqis or the Iranians. This controversy seems to have been 
decided for at least the coming decade. Iran is gradually 
becoming Israel's No. 1 enemy. Iran's military procurement plan 
will very soon make it the most formidable military power in the 
Middle East. 
  The blend of military power and Khomeyni's gospel is a 
dangerous cocktail, and it has been the cause of sleepless 
nights for Yitzhaq Rabin and other officials responsible for 
state security. Expert evaluations speak of an Iranian nuclear 
bomb within six years. According to various guesses, Iran 
already has one in the basement. The Israeli procurement of 
upgraded F-15's at the cost of $2 billion was designed to 
provide the capability to reach Iran in order to take care of 
the bomb problem. 
  Just like the Syrians, Israel has always been fond of 
working 
the Middle East through messengers. That was the case with the 
Kurds in Iraq and the Maronites in Lebanon. An Israeli 
initiative for reconciliation with Iraq can serve several 
objectives, the first and foremost being the start of Iraq's 
rehabilitation and its evolvement from a crippled country to a 
prominent power in the eastern sector of the Fertile Crescent as 
a response to the Iranian threat. 
  A strong (but not too strong) Iraq, which has a peace treaty 
with Israel, can become a potent counterbalance to the Iranian 
threat. Such an Iraq may even force the Iranians to have second 
thoughts about Israel. An Israeli-Iraqi reconciliation will 
rush al-Asad's Syria to the negotiating table and relegate the 
present power and prestige games to oblivion. If the initial 
advances take shape, Israel should seize the opportunity with 
both hands. Despite all the hazards which are forever present 
in the Middle East, it would be the most significant tactical 
and strategic achievement of the Rabin government's peace moves.

  [Text] President Milan Kucan today will end his three-day 
official visit to Israel, where he attended the 4th 
international business forum as a guest. Vojko Plevel reports 
that he met with Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this 
morning: 
  [Begin Plevel recording] After yesterday's meeting with 
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and two meetings with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, President Kucan also met with 
Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this morning. The two 
exchanged views and assessments on the current international 
situation, especially the circumstances in the Middle East and 
in the Balkans and, naturally, in Europe. They both agreed that 
the belief that the mere collapse of the Berlin Wall would 
resolve the situation in Europe proved to be an illusion and 
that we need to further strengthen our efforts to assert 
democracy as an alternative to war, as well as equality of 
smaller and less developed nations. Russia remains the biggest 
puzzle, to which recent events can attest. 
  Regarding bilateral contacts and possibilities for their 
strengthening, President Kucan after these talks assessed that 
with the Israeli partners he found understanding and interest 
for Slovenia that exceeded a mere bilateral interest. They have 
also shown an interest to intercede on behalf of our economic 
and political interests in their international contacts, 
especially where international policy is being decided and where 
they are present because of their specific position. They also 
fully support our efforts for integration into Partnership for 
Peace, which they, just like ourselves, assess as preparation 
for a new collective security system in the world. 
  President Kucan will end his visit to Israel this afternoon 
with a speech at the 4th international forum in Jerusalem. [end

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday met in his 
office in Jerusalem with Slovenian President Milan Kucan and 
turned down his request to buy weapons from Israel. Rabin 
explained to Kucan that Israel will continue to abide by the 
international arms embargo on the former Yugoslav republics and 
will not sell weapons to Slovenia at this stage. 
  The Slovenian president told Rabin his country is 
experiencing great difficulties due to the war in neighboring 
Bosnia, as well as the sanctions and the embargo on the region, 
and asked him to enhance security relations between Slovenia and 
Israel. 
  The prime minister told Kucan that Israel understands and 
supports the desire of small nations to conduct an independent 
life. Israel will be prepared to hold contacts on 
security-related issues and examine various proposals for 
cooperation with Slovenia, but will under no circumstances 
whatsoever violate the sanctions and the embargo, Rabin said. 
"Once the embargo and the sanctions are lifted, we can 
definitely discuss the strengthening of security relations," the 
prime minister promised the visitor. I hope our two countries 
will strengthen their relations and will soon be able to sign 
cooperation agreements on economic issues, investment 
protection, and tourism. 
  Slovenia has over the last few months been in contact with 
Israeli elements to buy antiaircraft systems. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Over the weekend, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
underwent surgery somewhere around the eye area. 
  His doctors obliged him to wear an eye patch to cover the 
treated area. Consequently, Peres decided not to appear in 
public. 
  Peres did not participate in the cabinet session on Friday 
[25 February] nor in the meeting Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
held yesterday with the heads of the diplomatic corps in Israel. 
  The foreign minister is working from his home in Jerusalem 
and even granted an interview to Qol Yisra'el. It has been 
learned from his office that he will return to work within the 
next few days.

  [Text] A test launching of the Arrow missile took place 
this morning. The target missile was fired at approximately 
1100 [0900 GMT] but during the countdown, there was a 
malfunctioning in the ground system which prevented the 
launching of the intercepting missile. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
the technical problem had nothing to with either the target or 
intercepting missiles. The date of the next launching will be 
decided after the reason for the problem is located.

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David] </F>
  [Text] There has been yet another mishap in a test 
launching of the Arrow missile. A malfunctioning occurred 
during the seventh test launching of the Arrow missile. The 
project directors believe that the malfunctioning is in the 
missile's ground control system and has nothing to do with the 
missile itself. Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David 
is here with more details: 
  This morning's experiment was supposed to simulate the 
interception of a surface-to-surface missile with a chemical 
warhead. An Arrow missile, serving as the target, was launched 
from a ship far offshore at 1100 [0900 GMT]. During the 
countdown leading up to the launching of the intercepting 
missile, a malfunctioning occurred, which prevented it from 
being fired. A built-in self-destruct system was then used to 
destroy the target missile. It is believed that the 
malfunctioning occurred in one of the ground control system's 
computers and had nothing to do with the missile itself. 
  Amir Oren, a commentator on military affairs, reported that 
sources at the Defense Ministry and Israel Aircraft Industries 
claimed that the experiment was unnecessary and was only carried 
out as a result of pressure from American experts also working 
on the project. Over the next few days, the project directors 
will continue to try and locate the problem and repair it. The 
next test launching is expected to take place in approximately 
six weeks.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said today that the Security Council's delay so far in issuing a 
resolution on the massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
affects its credibility and that of the United Nations. 
  He added that the Security Council's postponement of the 
issue for reasons related to the stand of this or that state 
cannot be understood. 
  Commenting on the council's failure so far to adopt a 
resolution on the massacre, Musa said: The important thing is 
that this massacre was a criminal one and it cannot be passed 
over or forgotten. 
  Musa went on to say that the issue has changed from merely a 
human catastrophe to a political situation that represents a 
regression in the Security Council's status and role. He added 
that the Egyptian delegation in New York has been instructed to 
support the issuance of a resolution, not a statement, and to 
work to have the Security Council discuss this issue in light of 
the UN secretary general's report, which spoke about the 
presence of UN observers. 
  Musa stressed that the status of the Israeli settlements has 
become very serious and that the settlements and settlers must 
be put under control because their presence has become extremist 
and criminal, as was shown in the Hebron Mosque carnage. He 
said that it is high time that the status of the settlements was 
reviewed because they not only have political and legal, but 
also security effects, as they contain a large number of 
extremists, gunmen, and crazy people. 
  On the Israeli Cabinet's resolutions yesterday on the 
settlements and settlers, Musa said that it is important that 
the resolutions not be cosmetic. If the resolutions are 
cosmetic, they are rejected because the roots of the problem lie 
in the existence of the settlements and settlers, their 
encouragement, and the failure to protect the Palestinians. He 
stressed the need for a solution that will protect the 
Palestinians.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
said that Egypt insists on the peace process being conducted in 
accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace. He 
added that Egypt intervenes in this process only to defend the 
interests of Palestine and other Arab countries because it sees 
things from a different perspective than the United States, 
Europe, and Israel. The foreign minister said that the day will 
come when Egyptian efforts in this area will be brought to light. 
  In an interview that will appear in tomorrow's edition of 
the 
weekly magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF, Musa said that peace means the 
restoration of land that was lost on 5 June 1967 as well as 
Palestinian rights. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister said that any analysis of the 
talks will show that the Palestinian side is the weakest, for 
the Palestinians do not have many cards while Israel has the 
land, the power, and international assistance. Therefore, it is 
necessary for the Egyptians to throw their diplomatic weight on 
the Palestinian side to give it the momentum and power to 
negotiate. 
  Musa pointed out that Egypt has intervened on the side of 
the 
Palestinian delegation on more than 12 occasions. In each of 
these cases, the Palestinians would reach a certain point and 
then the Egyptians would step in and introduce alternative 
ideas, he explained. 
  Minister Musa said that there are no concessions being made. 
If we give Israel part of the land, this is a gain because the 
land was completely lost and there was no Palestinian presence 
or authority there that could be used to regain it. 
  The foreign minister said that if we let this opportunity 
slip by for five more years it will be lost completely. He 
noted that between 1967 and the late President Anwar al-Sadat's 
peace initiative in 1977, there were no more than a handful of 
settlements [built in the occupied territories] and only a few 
hundred settlers. Today, we are dealing with 180 settlements 
and upward of 200,000 settlers. If we fail to face this 
situation, the number of settlements will rise to 300 and the 
number of settlers to 0.5 million. The Jews will become a 
majority and we will not be able to get them out, Musa said. 
  The foreign minister denied that the situation in South 
Africa is analogous to that in the occupied territories. There 
is a great difference, he said. In South Africa there is a 
white minority and a black majority, no land is occupied, and 
discrimination is on the basis of skin color. The problem in 
Palestine is one of Israeli occupation coupled with thousands of 
immigrants pouring in from abroad and the millions that are 
being spent on them. The standards of international powers 
allow Israel to win land every day, he stated. 
  Minister Musa said that, had the Palestinians participated 
with us in the Camp David accords, we would now be discussing 
self-determination. Those who call for deferring the issue to 
future generations overlook the erosion of land, political 
momentum, and Palestinian presence. The also forget that 
Palestinians are living in hell and have no jobs or hospitals, 
Musa pointed out. 
  The foreign minister rhetorically asked if it is not better 
for Yasir 'Arafat to return to Jericho; tour the occupied 
territories; take control of Nablus and other towns; and open 
universities, schools, and hospitals. 
  In his interview, Musa noted that Egypt has never abandoned 
its role in Somalia. He said the first phase of the Somali 
problem required the sending of food and humanitarian aid. This 
role was undertaken by the rich states and the international aid 
organizations, which managed to stop the famine. 
  Musa noted that the political role of reforming the 
situation 
in Somalia is a very complicated matter. It is impossible for 
one state, no matter how strong, to undertake a drastic action 
in Somalia alone. 
  Musa explained that Egypt could not have intervened alone to 
separate the warring factions in Somalia. He noted that the 
United States was the only state that was able to implement the 
Security Council resolutions. The United States was the only 
state that could move a whole army and its ancillary equipment 
to Somalia. 
  Musa said Egypt is calling for four things in Somalia: the 
establishment of a government or a transitional administration, 
the achievement of national reconciliation, the disarmament of 
the Somalia factions, and the reconstruction of Somalia. He 
said that Egypt emphasizes that national reconciliation must 
include all factions without discrimination. Therefore, it has 
invited all factions, including the faction of General Aidid, 
because it rejects the principle of electing one person from 
among the factions and installing him because soon afterward the 
civil war would resume. 
  Musa stressed that Egypt can help Eritrea and compete with 
Israel's role. However, it cannot compel Eritrea not to 
cooperate with Israel because this is considered intervention in 
its internal affairs. He indicated that it is in Egypt's 
interest to help Eritrea, instead of Israel. 
  Musa called on the Iraqi regime to recognize Kuwait without 
preconditions so that the Arab crisis with Iraq can end. He 
noted that the crisis lies in the Iraqi regime's insistence that 
Kuwait is Iraq's 19th province. 
  Musa explained that Egypt is against the partition of Iraq. 
However, it cannot approve of Iraq's stance on Kuwait or call 
for lifting the blockade on Iraq unless it complies with the UN 
resolutions. He stressed that Egypt is prepared to do 
everything to ease the Iraqi people's suffering. However, Egypt 
does not have the last say on this subject. Musa denied that 
there are any direct or indirect Egyptian-Iraqi contacts. 
  On Egypt's stance on Libya, Musa explained that Egypt 
respects the UN Security Council resolutions but is against 
escalating them out of concern for the Libyan people's interest. 
He stressed the need for the trial [of the two suspects in the 
Lockerbie incident]. If there is disagreement on the venue of 
the trial, the Libyan demand must be taken into consideration 
because it is just. 
  Asked about the fate of Libyan opposition figure Mansur 
al-Kikhya, Musa said that contacts with Libya are still 
continuing, but we cannot accuse anyone until we have all the 
evidence. 
  Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement 
that the regime in Egypt is "shaky and unstable," the foreign 
minister affirmed that Egypt has received an official denial of 
this statement from Israel. Otherwise, there would have been a 
strong Egyptian reaction to it. 
  Regarding the terrorism issue, Musa said that it should 
neither be underestimated nor exaggerated because it is not new 
and has existed since the forties. He affirmed that the 
terrorist attacks and murders that are taking place will not 
affect political, social, economic, and technical progress. The 
issue is marginal. There are exaggerations in the foreign media 
in depicting the situation in Egypt. 
  Musa expressed the view that some neighboring countries 
support terrorism, but he refused to name these countries. 
  Asked about Egyptian-Sudanese relations, the foreign 
minister 
affirmed that despite the differences between Egypt and Sudan 
there is an opportunity for dialogue with the brothers because 
historic relations must not be allowed to collapse. He 
emphasized that Egypt opposes the secession of southern Sudan. 
At the same time, it believes that there should be no bloodshed 
among the same people because the people of the south are part 
of Sudan. 
  Musa affirmed that Egypt and Iran are large countries in the 
same area, and what links them is stronger than what separates 
them. The opportunity is available for the establishment of 
good relations between Iran and Egypt. 
  The foreign minister noted that he has good relations with 
Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. He said that 
Egypt, as a government, does not want a permanent split with 
Iran but the obstacle is the difference in views. 
  Musa noted that Egypt has often criticized Iranian policy 
toward the Gulf states, Iraq, and some African states because it 
wanted to draw Iran's attention to the fact that Egypt rejects 
any attempt to undermine Arab national security or infringe on 
the territories of any Arab state, and the United Arab Emirates 
in particular. 
  Musa said that Egypt has the largest market. The economic 
reform program goes hand-in-hand with the peace process. At a 
certain point in time we will achieve peace and a favorable 
Egyptian economic situation. If other favorable economic 
conditions are added, there will be no fear that Israel will 
control the situation. It is difficult to imagine that a small 
country like Israel can threaten us economically. 
  He added that the Israeli economy distinguishes itself in 
technological services and not in heavy industries, mass 
agriculture, or mass consumer production. He said that 
investors will go to the state that offers better conditions. 
For this reason, we must be able to provide favorable 
conditions for investment and economic progress, and this 
demands reaching an Arab understanding on this issue. 
  The foreign minister explained that the Middle Eastern 
market 
is a slogan. We are talking about a new situation in the Middle 
East with new economic, security, and political elements. 
  Musa affirmed that a Middle Eastern market cannot be 
realized 
before peace. Otherwise, where will Syria and Palestine stand? 
The Middle Eastern market means sitting together and defining 
the role of each party. This has not taken place and has not 
been raised until now.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that the shooting down of four Serb aircraft by NATO jet 
fighters is proof of NATO's seriousness in carrying out its 
ultimatum addressed to Serbia within the framework of UN 
resolutions. In a statement today, he said that this action was 
supposed to have been done earlier, but is still good 
nonetheless. He said that according to the reports we have 
received, the resolution on moving heavy weapons 20 km from 
Sarajevo has been violated. He stressed the need to strike at 
the forces that violate this resolution.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)--Demonstrations condemning the 
massacre that Israeli settlers committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque 
Square in Hebron continued in Egypt for the fifth day in a row. 
The popular and trade union organizations also continued to 
condemn this massacre. The Nasirite Arab Democratic Party 
staged a peaceful demonstration at noon today and issued a 
statement condemning the barbaric massacre and savage acts by 
gangs of Jewish settlers against the Palestinian people. The 
Party addressed a statement to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, calling for an emergency Arab summit to 
take a firm stand and confront the Zionist (?aggression) against 
the Palestinian Arab people in Palestine. 
  The statement stressed the need for all Arab countries to 
adhere to the resolutions of the Arab boycott of Israel. It 
called on the Arab League to pass a resolution demanding that 
the current peace talks, which have become a cover for criminal 
actions, be stopped. It called on the Arab League to declare 
practical and binding measures to bolster the Palestinian 
people's steadfastness in the occupied territories and to 
support their valiant intifadah for the liberation of all 
Palestinian territories. 
  The statement emphasized the need for the Arab League to 
exert efforts to restore Arab solidarity, unify the nation's 
efforts, and lift the blockade on Iraq and Libya. It called for 
putting all forms of pressure on the Security Council to pass a 
resolution providing for international protection of the 
Palestinian people, explicit condemnation of the massacre, 
dismantling the settlements, and disarming the settlers. 
  In Alexandria, the lawyers syndicate freedoms committee 
condemned the heinous crime and massacre committed in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. In a statement it released, the 
committee said that the Jewish settlers committing this crime 
and the killing and injuring of dozens of Muslims praying during 
the holy month of Ramadan demonstrate that Arab blood has become 
[words indistinct] for experts in genocide who have committed 
the massacres of Dayr Yasin, Sabra, and Shatila. 
  The social arts and science committee in Alexandria 
condemned 
the massacre, saying that it was carried out under the slogan of 
arms. It said that Israel let its settlers behave crazily, 
foolishly, and conceitedly. Israel, the statement said, refuses 
to disarm the settlers, which makes us unsure about the security 
of the Palestinian people and discredits Israeli claims. It 
stressed that this incident robs the peace process of its 
credibility. In the meantime, the Alexandria University campus 
was the scene of student demonstrations. The students shouted 
slogans hostile to Israel and condemned the horrific massacre 
committed against the Palestinian people. The lawyers, doctors, 
and engineers trade unions staged a huge march in Alexandria 
yesterday evening to condemn the massacre. 
  The al-Mansurah University board issued a statement 
condemning the bestial crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque, 
saying it shows savagery, barbarism, and violation of the 
sanctity of a divine religion. It called on the international 
community to take action quickly to ensure security and peace in 
this vital part of the world. It appealed to world public 
opinion to put an end to double standards in the application of 
international law.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Mar (MENA)-- A responsible security source 
has denied that any security man has fired a single bullet at 
the students who staged demonstrations in universities in 
protest over the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. In a statement 
today, he said that the security men's task was to prevent the 
students from leaving the university campus to preserve security 
and stability. He stressed that reports that certain security 
men fired bullets at students are totally baseless and false. 
He asserted that the task of the security men is primarily to 
keep law and order and maintain stability, noting that students 
have the right to express their feelings by staging a peaceful 
demonstration inside the campus without causing riots and 
instability.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 28 Feb (MENA)--Today's newspapers say the 
massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque uncovers the ugly face of the 
Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories in the West 
Bank and Gaza and proves that frenzied Israeli talk of security 
issues is just an illogical excuse that aims to guarantee the 
Jews' safety and undermine that of the Arabs. 
  AL-AHRAM warns that the coming stage might witness further 
tension in the territories and that extremist elements on both 
sides will get involved. Israel must show more flexibility in 
handling the circumstances if it wants peace and if the region 
is meant to see that peace in the foreseeable future, it says. 
  The paper calls on the Israeli Government to confront the 
Israeli terrorism with the same enthusiasm and firmness with 
which it confronts what it terms terrorist operations by 
Palestinians. The paper adds that the Israeli settlers' 
terrorism has exceeded all bounds. 
  AL-AKHBAR says the Israeli Government will be unable to wash 
its hands of the blood staining them. The Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre will remain a sign of disgrace that time will not 
erase, no matter how hard Israel tries to absolve itself of the 
responsibility, the paper says. 
  It adds that the Israeli Government's insistence on refusing 
to disarm Jewish settlers--despite all the crimes and those that 
will take place--reflects how Israeli officials belittle the 
lives of the Palestinian people, the legitimate owners of the 
land. 
  AL-AKHBAR adds that the UN Security Council is asked to send 
an international team to investigate this massacre, uncover its 
real motives and circumstances, and determine the extent of 
Israeli army involvement. The Council must also send 
international troops to protect the inhabitants of the occupied 
Palestinian territories to avoid a recurrence of such a heinous 
crime, the paper stresses. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ahmad Sha'ban: "Egypt Is Doing Its Utmost To </F>
Provide Protection for the Palestinians"] 
  [Text] It is noteworthy that, in the wake of the assault on 
the Ibrahimi Mosque, Israel has insisted on the need to continue 
the peace negotiations with the Arab parties, the Palestinians, 
Syrians, Lebanese, and Jordanians, while at the same time 
attempting to downplay the event as an individual act. 
  The issue now is not whether to continue negotiating but 
primarily how to protect the Palestinians, adopt measures to 
prevent a recurrence of the crime, and stop the settlers and 
extremists from threatening and terrorizing the Palestinians. 
The Israeli Government has primary responsibility for this. 
Likewise the United Nations must begin effective action for the 
same purpose and must issue clear and firm resolutions, 
including the confiscation of weapons, to prevent a recurrence 
of irresponsible and illegal violent acts by the Israeli 
settlers and provide protection for the Palestinian civilians. 
  The Israeli cabinet adopted some measures two days ago 
taking 
weapons away from some settlers and limiting their movements. 
The Palestinians found these decisions unsatisfactory because 
they tackle matters superficially and do not touch the basic 
issue, which is their protection. 
  Egypt has consistently stressed this point and President 
Mubarak has always voiced grave concern about the threats to 
which the Palestinians are subjected. Egypt made the same demand 
in its statement to the UN Security Council, urging it to adopt 
a clear resolution that will guarantee Palestinian safety in the 
occupied territories. Egypt also emphasized that the security 
requirements, which Israel never stops advocating, are not 
limited to the Israelis. It announced that similar attention 
must be paid to the Palestinian people's security requirements, 
especially in the coming stage when Israel will need to make 
confidence-building moves and prove its sincere peace intentions. 
  Since the bloody incident occurred, Egypt has conducted 
contacts with all parties to protect the Palestinians and 
prevent a recurrence of the incident which U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher described as the occupation's bloodiest day. 
President Mubarak telephoned U.S. President Clinton, 
Palestinian leader 'Arafat, and Yitzhaq Rabin. The Egyptian 
diplomatic establishment undertook other positive actions in 
many directions, particularly in the Security Council, to ensure 
that a positive and effective resolution is adopted. 
  In this connection, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has asserted 
that the Security Council will lose its credibility unless it 
adopts a resolution condemning the incident and providing 
international protection for the Palestinians. 
  News agencies have reported Israel's agreement, for the 
first 
time ever, to allow international observers in Gaza and Jericho 
and to disarm the Jewish settlers' weapons in Gaza and the areas 
surrounding Jericho, something described by some news agencies 
as an important concession. We say that, first of all, this is 
an auspicious step that came as a result of Egyptian and U.S. 
efforts. We note, however, that it does not represent an Israeli 
concession but is a necessary step to create a modicum of Arab 
trust and demonstrate a goodwill gesture and a constructive 
movement toward peace. 
  The Arabs, all the Arabs, are seeking peace and are doing 
much for this purpose. The other side, the Israelis, must act 
in the same spirit until both sides meet on the road leading to 
this objective. 
  The criminal assault on the Ibrahimi Mosque, causing so many 
casualties, has dealt a strong blow to the peace efforts. 
Objective Israeli measures that guarantee Palestinian rights 
can, however, end the crisis. This of course will need arduous 
efforts and time.

  [Text] Tunis, 1 Mar (MENA)--Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the 
PLO Information Department, has declared that the PLO rejects 
the Israeli proposals that seek to encourage the PLO to return 
to the negotiating table. He explained that the measures that 
the Israeli Government has adopted so far are mere worthless 
formalities. 
  In a news conference he held this afternoon, 'Abd-Rabbuh 
asserted that the Palestinian leadership wishes the peace 
process to continue and the negotiations to succeed but at the 
same time it believes that several major requirements need to be 
met to guarantee the success of this political process. 
  He announced that the foremost requirement is providing 
protection and security for the Palestinian people against the 
terrorists among the Israeli settlers. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh said that the Palestinian leadership will 
continue its contacts with all the concerned parties, namely the 
UN Security Council, the United States, Russia, and the EU in 
order to fulfill the necessary conditions to resume the 
negotiations. 
  The Palestinian official said that the current circumstances 
do not encourage the resumption of the negotiations because if 
they were resumed they would remain under the threat of the 
Israeli settlers' armed terrorism, particularly in the absence 
of any effective deterrent by the Israeli Government. 
  He pointed out that the measures and methods employed by the 
Israeli Army against the Palestinian citizens who were 
protesting the Hebron massacre caused many of them to be 
martyred and dozens to be wounded. 
  He added that the Israeli Government is still adopting 
limited and nominal measures against a small number of settlers 
but is using mass punishment against the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories, such as imposing total curfew and allowing 
the army to fire at them. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh said that Israel's disarming of five settlers is 
a measure that cannot convince anyone that it wishes to provide 
protection for the Palestinian people, especially when the 
Palestinians see large numbers of armed settlers walking about 
in their towns and villages. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh added that there seems to be a consensus about 
having international presence in the occupied territories and 
said this has now become an urgent demand in order to reassure 
the Palestinians that they will be safe from further violence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Indian Budget: Big Rise in Defence Spending"] </F>
  [Text] Even though not entirely unexpected, a 20 percent 
jump in India's military expenditure in its 1994-95 federal 
budget unveiled on Monday will be a matter of concern for many 
in the region and outside. It is a poor response to the new 
emerging compulsions of the post-cold war era as well as to new 
opportunities and the search for a possible reversal of the 
decades long arms race in South Asia. Above all it hardly helps 
those in Pakistan genuinely desirous of achieving a better 
equilibrium between its requirements of legitimate defence and 
development needs. If India, which is already spending more 
than dollars six billion on defence continues to feel insecure 
internally and externally, notwithstanding its huge size and 
relatively much more developed industrial base, how can Pakistan 
lower its guards with a more sensitive strategic location, lack 
of depth and limited industrial potential. India's proposed 
military spending of dollars 7.6 billion for the new fiscal year 
is up by dollars 1.27 billion and covers much than what is 
justifiable by its inflation rate of 8.5 percent. The 
substantial new increase is reportedly the highest since 1986-87 
when it recorded the highest jump of over 31 percent. On the 
whole the military spending maintains the tempo introduced into 
it since 1982-83. Apart from the three services, the border 
security force has also a higher allocation. 
  In its other features the Indian budget now indicates a new 
flexibility to break the rigid postures of the past few decades 
and respond more energetically to the new economic changes of 
the day. Indian finance minister has eased access to foreign 
exchange in a bid to move towards a full float of the Indian 
rupee. Domestic industry is being exposed to greater foreign 
competition by reducing custom duties on imports. Taxable 
incomes now have higher exemption limit while corporate tax rate 
has been substantially lowered. Credit will also be cheap with 
the banks lending rated slashed. But the lowering of external 
tariff has been balanced by some concessions to domestic 
industry to pull it out of the recession of the past two years. 
Such measures undoubtedly will further reinforce the process of 
the profound economic change set in motion in India since 1991 
to open its economy to foreign investors. Whether India can 
execute the process of the market-oriented economic reforms and 
achieve a balanced socioeconomic growth without containing her 
military spending is an open question. But Pakistani planners 
and economic policy makers need to closely monitor India's new 
moves to put it on the global investment radar screen, as 
emphasised by an Indian official recently. For a long time we 
have been used to superficial comparison of ours and the Indian 
economy. In a changing international and regional environment 
it is necessary to shed a complacent view and develop a more 
informed and critical understanding of the economic changes in 
India.

  [Text] Bombay -- Assistant Director General for Nuclear 
Safety, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Morris Rosen 
who was present at a seminar for exchange of operational safety 
experience of pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs) here, 
said at a press conference that he had heard about the CBS 
60-minute TV report on operational hazards in Indian nuclear 
reactors. 
  'I have not seen it. You have to be well aware of what's 
going on. You have to look at the design, operation, people 
involved and maintenance of the reactor'. 'In India. there is a 
well knit group with a lot of morale, which has worked together 
for long, has good experience an advantage over other 
countries', he said. 
  'In developing countries, the equipment may not be the 
latest 
but if you can adapt the machine to the given conditions, it is 
good enough. It is very easy to take a camera into people's 
homes and point out the dirt', he added. 
  Chairman, Atomic Energy Commission, Dr R Chidambaram 
described the American television news programme as malicious, 
mischievous and a deliberate mis-representation of facts'. 
  The report purports to expose ill-effects of radiation due 
to 
our reactors by focusing on some village ten miles away from the 
power plant. It seems a deliberate campaign to misrepresent our 
nuclear programme " he said. 
  Th operational radiological exposure to workers in our 
reactors is within specified limits, our main objective is to 
reduce the collective dose, he added. 
  The CBS show had criticised the functioning of Indian 
nuclear 
reactors by suggesting that safety guidelines were being 
violated in their working. 
  Pakistan was conspicuous by its absence at this meeting 
which 
was expected to bring together technical experts of the six 
member states which operate PHWRs, namely Argentina, Canada, 
India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea for an exchange of 
information on safety standards.

  [Text] It was learned today from the security services that 
Mourad Sid Ahmed, alias Djaafar El Afghani, the leader of the 
Armed Islamic Group [GIA] and nine members of his group were 
liquidated yesterday in the Algiers heights. The name of Djaafar 
El Afghani was linked to the kidnapping of three French citizens 
on 24 October 1993 outside their home in Krim Belkacem street. 
They were Mr. and Mrs. Tivano and Mr. Allan. The second case 
in which Djaafar El Afghani was implicated was the kidnapping of 
Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, the chairman of the Irshad and Islah 
[Guidance and Reform] charity society from his home in Blida 
last November.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and commander in chief of the 
Armed Forces, conferred this afternoon with the brother 
commanders of the Defense Ministry, the General Staff, the 
Interior Ministry, the security forces, the directors of 
departments and units, and military [word indistinct]. 
  The brother chairman of Presidential Council spoke to them 
and reviewed developments in the national arena following the 
signing of the document of accord in the Jordanian capital under 
the patronage of His Majesty King Husayn and the hospitality of 
the fraternal Jordanian people. This meeting was attended by 
all Yemeni political and popular forces. 
  The brother president told the audience: I am glad to meet 
with you before the end of this holy month to acquaint you with 
the results of this meeting, which received great Arab and 
international attention. Everyone thought that immediately 
after the signing of this document in Amman the crisis would be 
over and the state establishments would reunite in order to 
resume work and begin implementing the provisions of the accord 
document. You heard what happened later. Now we are making 
efforts to reunite the leadership and the state establishments, 
and to end all remaining skepticism, which certain elements have 
tried to sow. These elements always survive by plotting and 
fabricating strife at the expense of the people and the 
homeland. The brother president added: It is regrettable that 
these forces and elements have been practicing such activities 
since the outbreak of the Yemeni revolution and until now. 
These forces and elements are only concerned with their own 
interests, even if these interests conflict with the 
revolution's objectives and the aspirations of the Yemeni 
masses. He referred to the traces of fragmentation left from 
the Imam's regime and colonialism. 
  He said: On the eve of establishing the Republic of Yemen 
and the unity of the homeland, we were aware that we would face 
difficulties caused by these traces left by the old regime. We 
hoped that through wisdom and cooperation we would be able to 
overcome these difficulties, benefiting from [words indistinct] 
the lessons of history. But to those who do not want to see a 
united people and a prosperous homeland tried, from the first 
minute of unity, to resume their destructive activities. They 
poisoned relations of understanding, created a skeptical 
atmosphere, and incited division among the sons of the same 
homeland. They fomented conflicts and sectarian and tribal 
problems, and incited all backward practices, which the unity 
came to bury to overcome all tragedies from which our people 
suffered for so long. 
  The brother president said: We, and all the masses of the 
Yemeni people, led by the national military establishment, which 
offered the dearest sacrifices in defense of the revolution and 
for the sake of realizing unity, will work to protect the gains 
that we realized throughout the revolution's march, and we will 
not retreat whatever the price might be. We are prepared to 
sacrifice for the sake of preserving the revolution's march and 
to protect the unity of the homeland. We will not hesitate to 
offer concessions and to relinquish power, if need be, in order 
to preserve the revolution's march and the homeland's unity. We 
presented this idea during the Amman meeting, and we said: 
Instead of differing over posts, it is possible to sacrifice 
some leaders and relinquish power for the sake of the unity of 
14 million Yemenis. 
  The brother president expressed deep sorrow for what 
happened 
recently in Mudiyah and some areas in Abyan as a result of 
certain movements made by some adventurous military commanders, 
against the orders and instructions of the political leadership 
and the hierarchy of the military command. These commanders 
will shoulder full responsibility for the mistakes they made and 
for the bloodshed and killing of innocents that they have caused. 
  He expressed his sorrow and condolences to the families of 
martyrs who fell during these regrettable incidents. He 
emphasized that the state will take care of the martyrs' 
families and will bring to account everyone responsible for 
these incidents. 
  He said every drop of blood shed in these incidents is a 
loss 
for the people and the homeland. The brother president 
considered all those killed in these incidents martyrs for the 
sake of unity, stressing that the state is committed to dealing 
with all issues that result from these incidents. 
  The brother president referred to the tasks of the military 
committee assigned with ending the military deterioration. He 
instructed the commands of the Defense Ministry and the General 
Staff to facilitate all tasks of the committee and overcome all 
difficulties for it in order to allow it to carry out its duties 
in following up implementation of the military aspect of the 
document of accord and ensure the withdrawal of the military 
forces to their garrisons as they had been before the beginning 
of the crisis on 19 August 1993. 
  The brother president expressed his hope that every effort 
would be exerted to restore confidence and dispel doubts within 
the command. He said that confidence could not be achieved 
through a decision or decree by the Republic, but through 
national practice and behavior, apart from exaggeration or 
oneupmanship. He asserted that past practices, behaviors, 
statements, and media polemics do not honor any nationalist 
cause or maintain the homeland's interests. He said that he 
issued instructions to the official media to prevent the 
broadcast of any statements that may further the current 
deterioration. 
  The brother president pointed out in his speech that it is 
the sons of the military and security establishments that paid 
the price for the 1972 and 1979 conflicts. He said they were 
the victims of the conflict, and that after each conflict before 
the unity, disputing parties sat at the dialogue table after our 
people paid a high price for those conflicts. So, why do 
parties not sit at the dialogue table to discuss all issues in a 
brotherly spirit before shedding drops of pure Yemeni blood and 
instead of repeating the tragedies, which our people cannot 
stand and which we do not need? He pointed out that the unity 
is a source of pride and strength for every Yemeni and its is 
also a new birth for Yemen. This unity, he said, has produced a 
new mechanism, which we should use, benefiting at the same time, 
from others' positive experiences in the areas of security, 
economy, administration, and construction. 
  The brother president also pointed out that the signing of 
the document of authorization for the military committee by the 
brother president and his deputy has won the satisfaction of the 
fighters and the masses of the people and that instructions have 
been issued to provide every facility for the joint military 
committee to achieve success in its mission. The Presidential 
Council chairman also stressed that no party has the right to 
control any Yemeni region or exercise trusteeship over the 
people in any part of Yemen. [Word indistinct] of the 
constitutional and legitimate institutions that are freely 
elected by the people to represent them here and abroad. 
  The brother president said: We have great confidence that 
you, O brother fighters and comrades-in-arms, will shoulder your 
responsibility and confront those who create conflicts in 
society. The conflicts should end, and we will do all we can to 
prevent sedition in our society. We will root out those who 
spread sedition in order to entrench security and stability and 
to maintain our national unity. Within the next few weeks, we 
will, God willing, return to our bases safely under the banner 
of unity and democracy; we will turn over a new leaf in the 
interest of the homeland; we will heal the wounds; and we will 
exert efforts to promote confidence through dialogue, meetings, 
and sincerity. The military committee will withdraw [words 
indistinct] to their previous regions in order to translate the 
contents of the accord document and to withdraw units from the 
dividing lines to other areas. There are good signs, he said, 
that the committee will succeed in its mission, and we in the 
command will direct and urge all the military commands to 
cooperate with the military committee and facilitate its 
mission. Any individual or group that rejects orders will be 
fully responsible. We hope that this blessed meeting will be a 
step toward a comprehensive solution to the crisis. I wish you 
every success. The meeting was attended by Interior Minister 
Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil, Chief of Staff Brigadier 
General 'Abdallah al-Tihami, Deputy Chief of Staff for 
Operations Affair Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, and several 
officials from the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry.

<F P=106> [Speech by Nabih Birri, speaker of the Lebanese Chamber of </F>
Deputies, in al-Qardahah, Syria--live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Your Excellency President great 
brother struggler Hafiz al-Asad; Your Excellency President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi; gentlemen: While trying to mend our broken hearts, 
allow me to depart from the realm of emotions to the realm of 
politics for a while. 
  On 4 March 1984, an Israeli explosive device went off at the 
al-Husayni Club in Ma'rakah in southern Lebanon, killing a crowd 
of people and a group of resistance men. On that day, Muhammad 
Sa'd and Khalil Jiradi, two resistance leaders, closed their 
eyes for the last time, fully aware that lofty southern Lebanon 
will persist with its resistance activities, that it will bow to 
nobody except God, and that it will shed no tears, except when 
it beseeches God, imploring Him for mercy. 
  Now, 10 years after the Israeli crime against a house of 
faith and resistance, and only a few days before the anniversary 
of that event, Israel, using sinful hands, has perpetrated a new 
crime against a house of God in the heart of Lebanon. Had it 
not been for God's grace and providence, this criminal massacre 
would have assumed monstrous proportions. It is no coincidence 
that only 50 hours separated the two crimes committed against 
peace in both Lebanon and the region. One of these crimes 
targeted faithful people and the Church in Lebanon, while the 
other targeted faithful people and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. 
  This month, approximately two weeks before the two massacres 
took place, I said that we would face real terrorism that could 
revive the terrorism of the Stern Gang and Haganah. I 
elaborated, saying that daily events show that Israel is 
upgrading its combat capabilities and staging maneuvers, the 
last of which was staged in the Golan on 9 February 1994. All 
these developments show that Israel is heading for war, rather 
than peace. I also said then, and I reiterate this right now, 
that I would not be making any miscalculations when I say that 
Israel is incapable of walking the path of settlement, and of 
paying a price for peace. This is because the Palestinian, 
Syrian, and Lebanese experience with Israel has revealed the 
dark shadows of an Israeli belligerence and occupation that 
cannot be removed by an unrequited peace. 
  The bloodbaths in the holy lands of Palestine and Lebanon 
are 
the best evidence that Israel is incapable of making peace. The 
new Israeli massacres are carbon copies of the massacres 
committed in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Bahr al-Baqar, Hula, al-Khiyam, 
Bint Jubayl, al-'Abbasiyah, al-Zurayriyah, and Ma'rakah. 
  Despite this bloody Israeli record, we still feel that 
Israel 
is granted immunity by the international community. It is 
allowed to act as it wishes, depending on the veto right, which 
is preventing the passage of firm international resolutions and 
the implementation of the provisions enshrined in Chapter 7 of 
the UN Charter against it. This renders the killing of our 
peoples, as is happening at present, a condonable crime, and the 
killing of a single Israeli settler or soldier on our occupied 
territories an unforgivable crime. Their occupation of our 
territories is justified, whereas our resistance on our own 
national soil is deemed terrorism. 
  At any rate, and in the aftermath of the bloodbaths the 
international community has seen with its naked eye, is there 
any longer anybody who believes in the attainability of peace on 
Israeli terms, when the places of worship have become targets of 
outrageous Israeli attacks? This is not indicative of a change 
in our options. For, in the first place, Syria and Lebanon, 
which share a common history, geography, destiny, and future, 
have adopted just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option. 
Such peace must liberate the territories and guarantee the 
restoration of rights upheld by international resolutions. 
  Hence, His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has 
characterized the peace we are striving to achieve as the peace 
of the brave. This peace is grounded in the option of 
resistance, struggle, and intifadah against the occupation. 
This is because these things are an indivisible part of our 
ancestry, heritage, Arabism, and creed, and also because they 
reflect rights enshrined in the UN Charter and international 
legitimacy. The confrontation of occupation is upheld by the UN 
Charter and international legitimacy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Fu'ad al-Batayinah, charge d'affaires of the 
Jordanian mission at the United Nations, has called on the 
Security Council to embark on measures to protect the 
Palestinians under occupation in accordance with the Security 
Council resolutions on the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements. 
Addressing the Security Council during its session last night 
to discuss the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, 
al-Batayinah said: What is required is to provide effective 
protection for the Palestinian people to ensure their safety, 
security, and basic liberties, to save the holy places from 
desecration, and to remove the Israeli settlements. The 
objective, he added, is to continue the peace process to reach a 
just and honorable settlement based on Israeli withdrawal from 
all occupied Arab territory and to ensure the Palestinian 
people's legitimate rights.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the Palestinian 
demand for a bigger police force is legitimate, and Israel is 
prepared to discuss it. Peres was speaking in Jerusalem at a 
joint press conference with the visiting Cambodian Foreign 
Minister, Prince Norodom Sirtvut. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres was 
asked about the long-term effects of the Hebron massacre on the 
peace process. He said it was a real tragedy that had created a 
great problem, and he took it very seriously. However, he 
rejected the Palestinian demand for an international force to 
protect the Palestinian civilians and for the disarming of all 
the settlers. 
  [Peres] We don't have to punish people who are peaceful and 
who support peace. What we have really to prevent is this small 
group of terrible, opinionated people, who may pose another 
problem. In a democracy, you act against dangers and you don't 
punish innocent people. 
  [Katzenell] The settlements will remain where they are, 
Peres 
said. But when he was asked about the proposal to evacuate the 
settlers from downtown Hebron, he said he would express his view 
at the cabinet meeting first, not to the media. 
  The foreign minister expressed confidence that the 
negotiations with the Palestinians would be resumed soon. I 
don't know what all their demands are, he said. I was told that 
they are interested perhaps in increasing their police force. 
That is a legitimate demand, Peres said. We shall sit down and 
discuss it. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa emphasized today that the 
situation in the occupied Arab territories remains dangerous and 
demanded that matters be brought under control in line with 
international law and in accordance with Israel's responsibility 
as an occupying power. 
  The foreign minister said that consultations are under way 
at 
the UN Security Council to issue a resolution about the Hebron 
massacre. He noted the need to prevent a recurrence of such a 
hideous incident by disarming the settlers in the Hebron area. 
  He added: If the settlers are going to have weapons for 
self-defense, the Palestinians must be given the same right. If 
the occupying power protects both the settlers and the 
Palestinians, this will be another matter and in that case the 
settlers' weapons must be removed. 
  Musa said such a measure would serve the interests of the 
Israelis and the Palestinians.

  [Text] Judge Munif 'Uwaydat, public prosecutor at the court 
of appeals, has denied a REUTER report that four women were 
arrested in connection with the explosion at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il, that initial investigation 
showed they planted the bomb near the church altar, and that a 
fifth woman believed to be the leader of the gang has fled 
abroad. 'Uwaydat said the investigation is secret and 
continuing. A judicial investigator will be appointed in 
implementation of the Council of Minister's decision. 
  Commenting on the REUTER report, security sources said the 
authorities in such cases detain many suspects and witnesses. 
They added that six women gave testimonies as witnesses and 
were then released. 
  Another security source has categorically denied REUTER's 
report, pointing out that the investigation is completely secret 
and is being conducted by three people supervised by the 
Lebanese Army's intelligence directorate. The investigation is 
being shrouded in the necessary secrecy to achieve quick results. 
  Other sources said that the security authorities have 
detained six people for questioning as witnesses, including 
three women. 
  According to available information, the pertinent security 
authorities recently detained a non-Lebanese person married to a 
woman from Kasrawan district. He frequently visited a religious 
leader and asked him for help to get Lebanese citizenship. 
Security sources said that this person informed the religious 
leader that there was a plan to detonate bombs in various places 
of worship, including Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il. 
He said he received the information from a Lebanese man. 
Instructions were then issued to security forces to keep a 
close watch on the places named and search them after securing 
permission from the religious authorities concerned.

  [Text] In response to the Church massacre, the Progressive 
Socialist Party has asked international organizations to 
reconsider the acquittal of Zionism and confront Israeli 
barbarism and racism. 
  The party's Foreign Relations Office has cabled the United 
Nations secretary general, the Arab League secretary general, 
Amnesty International, the EU president, the secretary general 
of the Islamic countries organization, his holiness the pope, 
and the president of Socialist International. 
  The cable said: We cabled you a few days ago condemning the 
Zionists' horrendous massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. Today, we cable you to condemn another massacre 
perpetrated by the same hand against innocent worshipers in 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq, Lebanon. These and many 
previous massacres confirm the nature of Zionism and require us 
all to reconsider some UN resolutions that acquitted Zionism and 
(?overlooked) its past and present. We urge international and 
regional institutions, all human rights organizations, and all 
countries and parties to adopt immediate, courageous positions 
against this barbaric racism, which denies every human right and 
threatens world peace if its interests are not served.

  [Text] Beirut, March 1, IRNA -- Iran's embassy in a 
statement issued here Monday strongly condemned the Sunday 
explosion of a bomb in a Maronite church in Juniyah port in 
Lebanon. 
  Explosion of the church was a criminal act with the 
objective 
to cover the massacre of Muslim Palestinians in Hebron, the 
statement read. 
  The embassy's statement which was quoted in Tuesday's papers 
here, stressed that "the hand which shed the Muslims blood in 
Hebron, was the same which exploded the Maronite church." At 
the end of the statement, the embassy expressed sympathy with 
the victims families as well as the Christian Lebanese community. 
  Ten people were killed and 60 injured on Sunday due to the 
explosion of a bomb at the altar of the Maronite church in 
Juniyah port.

<F P=106> [Report by Michel Castex] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, March 1 (AFP)--The killing of nine 
worshippers in a church bombing has heightened fears among 
Christians for their future in Lebanon, where they feel 
politically marginalised, analysts and politicians said on 
Tuesday. 
  Just hours after the victims were buried several Christian 
political leaders turned on the government, demanding that it 
fulfil its responsibilities by identifying and punishing the 
bombers. 
  Many agreed the government was wrong to focus its attention 
on ambitious projects to rebuild Lebanon's war-shattered 
infrastructure when it should first strengthen security and 
address social issues. 
  The head of the Maronite Church, Monsignor Nasrallah Sfayr, 
set the tone at a funeral service Monday in Our Lady of 
Deliverance Church, where 55 worshippers were also wounded 
during Lent Mass on Sunday. 
  "All the Lebanese have the right to a life of freedom 
without 
fear, frustration and inequality," Sfayr said, urging the 
government to rectify its mistakes. 
  "Saying that such things happen in other countries is not 
enough for us. Elsewhere the culprits are found and punished, 
but here they are not identified because of negligence or 
incompetence," he added. 
  Karim Paqraduni, Secretary General of the right-wing 
Christian Phalange Party, echoed Sfayr, speaking to AFP on 
Tuesday. 
  "There is no political will to arrest those responsible for 
this revolting crime," he said. 
  Paqraduni escaped a December bomb attack on his party's 
headquarters during a weekly leadership meeting because he was 
abroad at the time. Three people were killed and 100 wounded, 
and the bomber is still at large. 
  The church bomb "played into the hands of extremists on all 
sides," Paqraduni said. 
  "The bomb clearly underlined a political desire to 
destabilise the situation in Lebanon, terrorise Christians and 
push them to react, in a bid to create a civil war situation in 
Lebanon," Paqraduni said. 
  "The government's political inefficiency allowed this to 
happen," he added. 
  For 'Isa Ghurayb, chief editor of the French-language 
L'ORIENT-LE JOUR, the "horror" which plagued Lebanon during its 
1975-1990 civil war had returned to haunt the Lebanese. 
  Ghurayb, whose newspaper is owned by Culture Minister Michel 
Iddih, said the church bombing was the latest in a series of 
unpunished attacks against Christian targets in Lebanon. 
  "These repeated acts of aggression worry the Christians, 
mainly the Maronites, because they coincide with an 
unprecedented political imbalance in Lebanon ... (where) a 
growing number of Christian feel they have become alienated. 
  "Nothing is being done to remedy this disastrous feeling. 
There are just hollow calls to close ranks around the 
government," he said. 
  Samir Ja'ja', head of the former Christian Lebanese Forces 
militia, accused the government of failing the Lebanese people, 
who "have realised that the security the authorities promised to 
restore is still a mirage." 
  The sense of frustration arose after the 1989 al-Ta'if 
inter-parliamentary accord, which effectively ended the war in 
Lebanon, with the Christians agreeing to give Muslims a greater 
share in running the country. 
  It was exacerbated as the government failed to keep a pledge 
to introduce sweeping social and economic reforms, which led 
most Christians to boycott the 1992 legislative elections, 
protesting that they were imposed by Syria. 
  No demographic survey has been carried out in Lebanon since 
1932, but the Christians maintain they represent 50 percent of 
the three-million-strong population, even though hundreds of 
thousands fled the country during the war. 
  The Muslims say they outnumber the Christians by two to one, 
but the Maronites are the largest single Christian community.

  [Text] London -- Former Prime Minister General Michel 'Awn 
has called for a day of prayer and mourning for the souls of the 
victims of the Zuq Mikha'il explosion. In a statement to 
AL-HAYAH, he said that he had contacted Patriarch Nasrallah 
Sfayr suggesting that "a day of prayer and mourning be held for 
the souls of the martyrs with the patriarch urging all the 
Lebanese to attend. Then, after the day of prayer, a national 
stance would be formulated." 
  That was Gen. 'Awn's first contact of its kind with the 
patriarch since he left Lebanon. He had a courtesy contact with 
him through a third person when he was in Marseilles. 
  'Awn said that "the explosion was a part of a chain of 
incidents aimed at underming Christian-Muslim relations, 
including the attack on the al-Mansuriyah graves, the leaflets 
distributed to prevent feast celebrations, the Phalangist 
headquarters explosion, and, before that, the al-Balamand 
explosion." He said: "We are not accusing anyone, but we know 
that Syria is responsible for security in Lebanon, so if it is 
not in collusion, let it expose the perpetrators." 
  He added: "We do not want statements in the air condemning 
the traditional enemy, which is Israel, and those who do not 
want peace in Lebanon. We want identification of the culprits 
and their links, otherwise the Syrians should leave Lebanon 
because all their claims about maintaining security have fallen." 
  He continued: "Whichever hand perpetrated all these 
incidents, I call on the Lebanese, especially the Christians, 
not to level charges against one another and to close their 
ranks to put an end to this continuing plot against Lebanon. 
The culprits are the same people who hatched this plot as far 
back as the early seventies and who agreed to depose me by force 
on 13 October 1990 in order to complete the plot because I had 
urged you all to cut off the foreign extensions in Lebanon." He 
concluded: "I hope the world's condemnation will be at least as 
strong as its condemnation of the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre 
because the only difference between the two incidents is in form 
not in substance."

  [Text] Following the horrible massacre, the Progressive

the UN secretary general, Arab League secretary general, Amnesty 
International, the EU president, the secretary general of the 
Islamic Countries League [as heard], the pope, and the head of 
Socialist International. 
  The cables said in part: The horrendous massacre that the 
Zionists committed today against innocent Palestinian 
worshippers is the greatest evidence of terrorism and delinquent 
behavior demonstrated by the usurping Israeli entity since it 
was founded with the help of those who claim to be concerned 
about civilization, democracy, freedom, and human rights. 
  If this is the promised Israeli peace, then let it be seen 
by 
the entire world's international, regional, and humanitarian 
institutions. We and history await your stance and your verdict. 
  The Lebanese Communist Party [LCP] denounced the massacre 
and 
said it was an attempt to impose additional conditions on the 
Palestinian side and put pressure on other Arab parties.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
abroad yesterday condemned the Algerian security forces' killing 
last Saturday of Sid Ahmed Mourad [Djaafar El Afghani], leader 
of the Armed Islamic Group [GIA]. It stressed that "there can 
be no solution except complete submission to the will of the 
people." 
  It is the Front's first comment on the killing of El 
Afghani, 
whose group's statements persistently criticized the approach of 
dialogue with the authorities and vehemently attacked FIS 
leaders. 
  Well-informed sources interpret the FIS condemnation of the 
GIA leader's killing as "a clear attempt to intercept any 
accusations which could be leveled at it in the future to the 
effect that it was behind his betrayal." 
  This condemnation comes while Shaykh Mahfoud Nahnah, leader 
of Hamas [Islamic Society Movement], attacked circles "claiming 
to belong to the Islamic tendency," accusing them of killing the 
preacher Shaykh Mohamed Bouslimani, a prominent Muslim 
Brotherhood leader. The authorities accuse the GIA of killing 
the preacher, who -- according to Shaykh Nahnah -- refused to 
issue a fatwa sanctioning acts of murder. 
  Shaykh Rabeh Kebir did not sign the FIS statement. This is 
in 
the knowledge that he has been officially notified by the German 
authorities of the decision to ban him from pursuing political 
activities. The statement, which carried the signature "the 
Executive Committee abroad," accused the ruling regime in 
Algeria of "escalating assassination operations against innocent 
citizens throughout the homeland in the hope of terrorizing and 
intimidating people further." 
  The statement added that "the cowardly criminal operation 
carried out by the repressive authorities against the mujahid, 
leader, martyr, and Sword of Islam Djaafar and a group of his 
aides -- who were the elite of the mujahidin, heroes, and 
martyrs -- reflects the aims of the regime, which is oppressing 
the Algerian people by fire and sword. Let the regime and its 
supporters know that, whenever a leader falls in the arena of 
honor, a new leader succeeds him and follows the same line." 
  The statement pointed out that these operations come while 
the regime continues to talk about looking for negotiated 
solutions to the crisis afflicting the country, which is caused 
by the regime." 
  The statement concluded: "There can be no solution to the 
political problem in Algeria except complete submission to the 
Algerian people's will to build a just, Islamic state that will 
rid people of oppression, repression, and corruption and restore 
to them their dignity and freedom." [passage omitted] 
  Observers say that FIS statements condemning Djaafar El 
Afghani's killing may be designed to cut short the possibility 
of having an accusing finger pointed at it for revealing the GIA 
leader's whereabout. These observers attribute the possibility 
of such an accusation against it to reports about a dialogue 
being conducted between it and the authorities and the 
possibility that the authorities may have asked it to halt 
violence in return for political concessions demanded by the FIS. 
  There are reports in Algeria to the effect that members of 
armed groups are informing against one another and that many 
members of these groups are falling as a result of this. There 
is also widespread talk that the Algerian authorities have been 
able to infiltrate the GIA. 
  Djaafar El Afghani assumed the group's leadership last year 
after its leader 'Abd-al-Haqq al- 'Ayayidah was arrested in 
Morocco and handed over to Algeria. Al-'Ayayidah has still not 
been tried. 
  AL-HAYAH yesterday received a statement from the GIA in 
which 
it announced the death of its leader, pledging to continue the 
"jihad." It also stressed that it "will -- God willing -- 
continue its jihad until God proclaims this religion or until we 
die for the sake of it. The conspiracies of the Jews, 
Christians, and apostates will not change it (the group). Nor 
will the sayings of the atheists who have sold their consciences 
to the East and the West affect its determination." It also 
said that El Afghani "is not the first leader to fall, nor will 
he be the last. It is God's will, and this is our road to make 
this religion prevail -- the road of jihad and martyrdom. There 
is no other road." 
  With regard to the security situation, FIS sources have said 
that six Army personnel were killed and 19 wounded the day 
before yesterday in an ambush set up by "mujahidin" in the 
mountains around al-Qall city the day before yesterday. The 
sources said that security forces "took revenge against unarmed 
citizens, killing al-Sayyid Kebir (60), uncle of Shaykh Rabeh 
Kebir." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Relaxation in Relations </F>
Between Libya and Algeria"] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis -- Algerian-Libyan relations are 
experiencing a clear relaxation which could lead to 
consolidating normalization and turning the page of the stormy 
dispute that erupted in recent months. 
  Well-informed Libyan sources yesterday described the visit 
to 
Algeria by Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, envoy of the Libyan 
leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and his talks with 
President Liamine Zeroual as "positive and fruitful, especially 
with regard to returning matters to normal between the two 
countries." 
  Major al-Humaydi, the first senior Libyan official to visit 
Algeria since the September crisis last year, has always 
maintained strong ties with Algeria and Tunisia, even at the 
most critical times. 
  A severe crisis erupted between Algeria and Libya following 
a 
speech delivered by Col. al-Qadhdhafi at the beginning of last 
July, in which he announced his willingness to mediate between 
the regime in Algeria and the Islamic Salvation Front's leaders, 
whom he described as friends of his. [passage omitted] 
  Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that the Libyan 
envoy's talks with senior Algerian officials resulted in 
important agreements as regards eliminating the causes of the 
previous escalation, first and most closing the Algerian base in 
al-'Ujaylah to the armed Libyan opposition, suspending media 
campaigns between the two countries, and reactivating bilateral 
relations. 
  The same sources said that Algeria, which took over the 
leadership of the Arab Maghreb Union from Tunisia last year, is 
seeking to improve relations with neighboring states and to 
eliminate the causes of tensions inherited from the former 
regime. It is also eager to contribute to ripening regional 
conditions for the convening of the Maghreb summit, which has 
been postponed indefinitely, in order to consolidate its 
leadership of the union and reactivate its institutions. 
  Observers believe that the revival of Algerian-Libyan 
relations is an important step toward eliminating the causes 
that have so far prevented the convening of the Maghreb 
Presidential Council's sixth session in the Tunisian capital.

  [Excerpt] UN, 3 Mar -- The State of Kuwait has welcomed the 
initiative of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, showing 
readiness to send UN observers to occupied Palestinian 
territories. Kuwait said that it would be appropriate for the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to have special 
responsibility for civilians living under Israeli occupation 
with a view to ensuring their safety. 
  In his address to the UN Security Council during a debate on 
the situation in occupied Arab territories last night, Muhammad 
Abu al-Hasan, Kuwait's permanent representative at the United 
Nations, stressed the need to disarm Israeli settlers, some of 
whom had perpetrated the vile massacre in Ibrahim's mosque in 
Hebron last Friday. 
  The Kuwaiti representative said that the Security Council 
had 
to make Israel responsible for protecting Palestinians from the 
recklessness of those who wanted to hinder the peace process. 
He said that settlers had to be disarmed and the extremists 
among them had to be put under constant surveillance. [passage

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has 
said that the settlement of Kashmir is in the vital interests of 
Pakistan and not Khalistan. Talking to newsmen informally in 
Parliament House today, he regretted that the opposition leader 
is attaching greater importance to Khalistan issue rather than 
Kashmir. Pakistan wants a dialogue with India on all issues 
provided India creates prosperous [as heard] conditions. He 
said we would send another two nonpapers to India within next 
few days. 
  To a question, the foreign minister said that if India 
learns 
to live like good neighbors and changes its hegemonic attitude, 
there would be peace in the region. 
  To another question on the increase in Indian defense 
budget, 
the foreign minister said it was extremely unfortunate as it 
will escalate the arms race in the region and create more 
poverty. 
  Responding a question on Pakistan's resolution on human 
rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir in UN Human Rights 
Commission, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said it would be a test for 
the level of world morality and it will expose the 
double-standards of the world community. 
  To yet another question, the foreign minister said Pakistan 
has not closed the border with Afghanistan, rather it has 
reestablished it as the international border.

  [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman has said in Islamabad 
today that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory and a final 
settlement of this dispute through a fair and impartial 
plebiscite under the UN auspices is pending. Referring to 
Indian claims on Kashmir, the spokesman said that such 
unilateral claims by India is tantamount to depriving Kashmiris 
of their inalienable right to self-determination. The spokesman 
called upon the Indian Government to settle this very important 
issue by ending the oppressive activities being carried out by 
its security forces in occupied Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Asia, Unite!] </F>
  [Text] The trade dispute between Malaysia and Britain has 
once again underlined the need for a united Asian front to take 
on the trade warriors of the West. The decision by Kuala Lumpur 
to ban British firms from government contracts worth billions of 
dollars has set a trend for the rest of the Third World 
countries to follow. Though these underdeveloped countries have 
not modern technology for which they depend on the West, they 
have huge markets which can be used as leverage against the 
coercive policies of the West. In the past Europeans had used 
trade as a launching pad for the furtherance of their 
imperialistic ventures. But the West should understand that 
this is not the 17th century. The East is now quite capable of 
protecting its hard earned freedom. The Malaysia-UK row started 
when the British Press alleged that top government officials in 
Kuala Lumpur including Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad had 
received kickbacks form British firms and the revolation of 
connections between arms and aid donations. The British 
Government argues that it has been using aid donations to boost 
weapons sale in order to salvage British ailing arms industry. 
  The Malaysian decison to stop dealing with British should 
serve as a beacon for the rest of the Asian countries. This 
should be specially so in case of major nations such as China, 
India, Indonesia and Pakistan who may not have as sound a 
technological base at present but are rapidly catching up with 
the West. China can provide the leadership that is vitally 
needed in a world where regional trade groups such as European 
Community are increasingly becoming cartels to protect the 
interest of its members. It may not be out of place to refer to 
the EC trade representative's statement warning that his 
organisation will not allow any country to isolate one of its 
members for discriminatory trade ban on political grounds. He 
was commenting on China's threat to impose sanctions on Britain 
because of the latter's policy on Hong Kong. 
  With the West now realising that its economy and military 
power is steadily but surely declining, it is desperately 
searching for new markets. Europe is already united under the 
banner of European Economic Community and Africa has not enough 
purchasing power. Thus Asia remains the only continent whose 
huge markets can save the sinking economy of the West specially 
the United States which according to one of its former secretary 
of state Henry Kissinger, is to lose its status of a superpower 
in a decade. It is not surprising at all that Kissinger has 
suggested that the United States should assume the 19th century 
role of the Britain in order to make sure that Asia does not 
unite under a single power. 
  Kissinger's statements must serve as an eye opener for those 
who still believe that the proposed new world order means 
anything less than 21st century equivalent of neocolonialism. 
Henry Kissinger has even gone to the extent of reminding his 
countrymen that they have fought two wars to make sure that 
Eurasia is not controlled by a single power centre implying that 
the Americans should be ready to go to war again if needed. 
Kissinger's utterance that the United States has learned to 
live with a united Europe makes it abundantly clear that the 
United States should be concentrating on promoting the forces of 
discard in Asia. [sentence as published] 
  Though Henry Kissinger no more holds an office, he gives 
expression to the contemporary US policies on Asia. Examined in 
the context of Pakistan's proximity to the Central Asian states 
via Afghanistan the civil war in Pakistan's neighbourhood does 
not seem to be a coincidence. Since Afghanistan provides the 
closest access to the Central Asia instability in this region 
serves US interest in the best possible way. It helps 
Washington to keep the countries of the region specially Iran 
and Pakistan in a constant state tension and making it difficult 
for the regional powers to unite in a bloc encompassing Paksitan 
Afghanistasn, Iran and Central Asian states of the former Soviet 
Union. 
  For us in Pakistan the lesson is very clear. The policy of 
staying away from Afghanistan runs counter to our interest. 
Islamabad will have to double its efforts to bring peace to 
Afghanistan, without whose cooperation the creation of a 
regional economic bloc will remain only a dream.

  [Text] The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, today denounced 
attempts to raise human rights issue in Kashmir by Pakistan and 
the United States. He declared in the Lok Sabha today that no 
country in the world has a better record in this regard than 
India. He said Pakistan teaching us about human rights is 
ridiculous. Mr. Chavan was replying to the day-long discussion 
on a statutory resolution seeking to extend president's rule in 
Jammu and Kahsmir for a further period of six months from 
tomorrow, which the House adopted by a voice vote later. The 
Rajya Sabha has already approved it. 
  In his 40-minute speech, Mr. Chavan questioned the intention 
of the U.S. Administration in raising the issue and asked what 
locus standi Washington has in recognizing or not recognizing 
the instrument of Kashmir's accession to India. He said neither 
they appear to help Pakistan, nor India, but themselves. 
[sentence as heard] 
  Referring to his meetings with British leaders, Mr. Chavan 
said he was sure that Britain, too, is not happy with the U.S. 
stand on Kashmir. 
  Appealing to all parties to consider the issue above party 
considerations, Mr. Chavan said any internal bickering will only 
weaken India in the international forums. He also strongly 
defended the role of the armed forces in the state and said all 
have to understand the difficult conditions in which they are 
functioning there. He said there is a qualitative change in the 
whole scenario, as the terrorists do not have the support of the 
local population anymore. 
  Earlier, initiating the discussion, Major B.C. Khanduri, BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party], urged the government to have a 
clear-cut policy on Jammu and Kashmir. Participating in the 
discussion, members from all sides of the house supported the 
resolution, but stressed the need for taking political 
initiatives to win the confidence of the Kashmiri people.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says it is unthinkable 
for a government relying on only 58 Knesset members to continue 
making decisions on extremely crucial issues in the life of the 
state. Rabin rejected threats by the Arab parties that they will 
cease to support the government if Tzomet joins the government 
coalition. Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv reports 
that the prime minister was speaking at Kibbutz Ginnosar at the 
end of a meeting with Beduins from the north on the memorial day 
for Yig'al Allon. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin says the Palestinians' demand to open up the 
agreements for renegotiation in the wake of the massacre in 
Hebron is unacceptable, because if agreements are reopened after 
two months, what sense will be there to future agreements? Our 
correspondent adds that the prime minister explained that before 
the famous handshake with 'Arafat, he turned to the PLO leader 
and told him in connection with the signing of the agreement 
that this will be very difficult, and 'Arafat replied: I know.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the longer the 
peace talks are halted, the more difficult it will be to resume 
them and the more complicated the situation on the ground will 
become. 
  Speaking to the Foreign Press Association, Rabin rejected 
the 
PLO's demands for more radical action against the Israeli 
settlers in the territories. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin made an 
impassioned appeal to the Palestinian leadership not to allow 
the late Barukh Goldstein to succeed in his aim of halting the 
peace process by means of the atrocity at the Hebron mosque. 
These are crucial days, Rabin said, and much will depend on how 
quick the negotiations are resumed. 
  [Rabin] The longer it will be dragged, the more it will be 
difficult to resume them, and the situation on the ground will 
be complicated. I believe that at this stage, the leadership on 
both sides -- the Palestinian and us -- has to stand up, to 
overcome pain, sorrow, and agony, and to understand that the 
real solution is in the political field. 
  [Katzenell] Rabin rejected Palestinian demands for the 
disarming of all the settlers. For decades the settlers have 
been the object of Palestinian terrorism, Rabin said, and even 
since the Oslo agreement, they have been the victims of 
terrorist attacks by the organizations opposed to the peace. 
  [Rabin] In coping with terror and violence, there were 
Palestinian victims, mainly in confrontations with the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and other security forces, but terror by 
Israelis, killing, was very rare, if at all. 
  [Katzenell] Rabin also rejected suggestions that the 
settlers be evacuated from down-town Hebron. In his view, this 
would mean accepting the Palestinian demand for immediate 
negotiations on the future of the settlements, and that would be 
a breach of the Declaration of Principles. If we reopen signed 
agreements after only five months, Rabin said, what value will 
there be to any new agreements that we sign with the 
Palestinians. [end recording] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 2 March adds: 
"Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today warned against the 
involvement of Russia in the peace process without coordination 
with the Americans. Rabin said that parties to the negotiations 
might take advantage of the absence of a Russian-U.S. 
cooperation. 
  ["Speaking to foreign reporters, the prime minister said 
Israel will continue imposing the closure on the territories for 
as long as Israel believes it necessary. He added that the 
attorney general is examining the possibility of issuing 
additional detention orders against Kakh activists in the 
territories. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that 
Rabin further said: I have taken all the necessary steps to 
prevent a massacre in Hebron, to the best of my discretion and 
with the best means I had at my disposal."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said this evening 
that Israel will agree to discuss new PLO requests, provided 
they do not contradict the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. 
Speaking at a conference on Jewish communications in Jerusalem, 
Peres noted that the deputy Russian foreign minister and the 
Greek foreign minister, arrived in Israel today from Tunis. 
They brought a message from the PLO leadership stating it is 
very important that Israel realize these are indeed conditions 
for the resumption of the negotiations. 
  Minister Peres clarified that Israel had accepted some of 
the 
conditions, including the release of prisoners. Israel agrees 
that the UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre 
include a temporary placement of foreign presence in Jericho and 
Gaza, in accordance with the DOP. We are also willing to 
discuss the Palestinian request that the autonomy police force 
be larger, Peres said. Our correspondent Amy Rhodes filed this 
report.

  [Text] The District Labor Court in Tel Aviv is due to begin 
considering a request by the Bezeq [Telecommunications Company] 
management to issue a restraining order against workers who have 
adopted measures that have caused serious interruptions in 
telephone communications all over the country. Our 
correspondent Meron Tzur reports that the workers have 
deliberately cut telephone communications to hundreds of 
thousands of subscribers. 
  Dozens of company workers stormed the office of the director 
general of the Telecommunications Ministry in Megdal Shalom in 
Tel Aviv at noon today, shouting loudly to prevent him from 
explaining the nature of the Bezeq Company's new license.

  [Text] Restrictive orders were issued today also against 
residents of the settlement of Tapuah in Samaria. Judy Lotz met 
two of them, who declared they will disobey the orders: 
  [Begin recording] [Lotz] What does your order say, David? 
  [David Axelrod] My order says that I may not enter Hebron 
and Qiryat Arba' for three months, starting yesterday. 
  [Lotz] Did you have to turn in your gun? 
  [Axelrod] I did not receive this order, but I heard it 
exists. 
  [Lotz] Did they come to take away your gun? 
  [Axelrod] They left notice that I should turn it in. 
  [Lotz] Did you? 
  [Axelrod] I did not, and I have no such intention. 
  [Lotz] You are violating the law, are you not? 
  [Axelrod] Am I? Forsaking Jews to be murdered is a 
violation of our beliefs. 
  [Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana] I do not believe people will turn in 
their guns. I find this hard to believe. I believe people will 
rather sit in jail. 
  [Lotz] Will you turn in your gun? 
  [Kahana] I will turn in nothing. I find these orders 
insignificant. They are illegal, immoral, and unreasonable. 
  [Lotz] Will you travel to Hebron and Nabulus, in defiance of 
the orders? 
  [Kahana] I will go anywhere I please in this country. [end 
recording] 
  The police arrested today Eyal Noqed, another Kakh activist, 
who is one of the five the police are seeking to place under 
administrative detention. Our police affairs correspondent Uri 
Kohen-Aharonov has learned that Noqed was captured in an 
apartment in Ra'anana, following intelligence information. 
Currently, there are two Kakh members in police detention. 
Qiryat Arba' residents fear that exile orders will be issued 
this evening.

  [Text] Several top officials from the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and other 
settler leaders have called on the Jewish residents of Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip not to comply with the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] orders to hand over their weapons. Our 
correspondent Gil Litman reports that it is unclear whether the 
settler leaders' declaration also referred to the Kakh and 
Kahana Hay activists who were ordered to turn in their weapons. 
The call was published following telephone consultations 
between the leaders of the Council of Jewish Settlements. The 
declaration said that confiscating the weapons of the Jewish 
residents at such a time was tantamount to jeopardizing their 
lives. The proclamation was signed by the leaders of the Efrat, 
Qiryat Arba', and Mate Binyamin local councils. 
  [Writing on page 12 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT on 3 March, 
Tzvi Singer, Ilana Baum, and Arye Kiesel add: "Thirty Qiryat 
Arba' public figures and rabbis decided close to midnight last 
night to call on the local Jewish residents to refuse to 
surrender their weapons to the IDF if they are told to do so, 
and to choose prison instead." "Among the call signers are Tzvi 
Katzover, Elyaqim Ha'etzni, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, Rabbi Shim'on 
Bet-Tziyon, and No'am Arnon. Joining the call were heads of 
numerous local councils in the territories, including Yisra'el 
Har'el, chairman of the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip; Yinon Ahiman, head of the Efrat 
local council; and Pinhas Wallerstein, head of the Mate Binyamin 
local council."]

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has offered 
Refa'el Eytan the police and internal security portfolio. If 
Tzomet joins the government, it will receive the environment 
portfolio as well. In a meeting scheduled for tomorrow, Rabin 
and Peres will attempt to soften Meretz in anticipation of 
Tzomet's inclusion in the government. Our party affairs 
correspondent Yaron Deqel has the details: 
  The Eytan-Rabin contacts began a long time ago. In today's 
meeting with Likud members, Eytan revealed nothing at all. A 
nocturnal meeting between the Tzomet chairman and the prime 
minister on 28 February gave birth to a written document 
detailing points of agreement between the two. Today the Tzomet 
Knesset members [MK's] received from Eytan -- each one 
individually -- information about the document. 
  The Labor-Tzomet document stipulates that Refa'el Eytan will 
be police minister in charge of Israel's internal security. 
Tzomet will receive another portfolio -- the environment -- and 
if that happens, Minister Sarid may be appointed information 
minister. 
  In the document, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin pledges not to 
harm the Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and to 
permit 5,000 completed housing units to be occupied. 
  Today the Tzomet chairman invited NRP [National Religious 
Party] leader Zvulun Hammer and apprised him of the possibility 
that Tzomet may join the coalition. [passage omitted] The NRP 
is not involved in the Tzomet-Labor political moves at this 
point. 
  The prime minister informed Shim'on Peres of the details two 
days ago. The meeting was attended also by Histadrut official 
Giyora 'Eyni, who along with Tzomet MK Pini Badash had 
negotiated Tzomet's inclusion in the government. 
  Tomorrow Rabin and Peres will meet with Meretz ministers. 
Ministers Shahal and Sarid are still in the dark about the prime 
minister's plan to give their portfolios away to Tzomet people. 
The move seems to be coming together.

  [Text] Minister Shim'on Shetrit says there is a solid 
majority in the Labor Party for the inclusion of [Tzomet Party 
leader] Rafa'el Etan in the government. According to him, 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres are in favor of this. It became 
clear to him in talks with the party leaders that the majority 
of them support the inclusion of Tzomet on the basis of the 
government's basic guidelines and Tzomet's conditions, which are 
consistent with the government's basic guidelines. This is 
reported by our parties affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal.

  [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Television Network 
in Arabic in a linkup with Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio 
Network in Arabic, at 0905 GMT on 2 March begins a live relay 
from al-Qardahah of a ceremony eulogizing Basil al-Asad 40 days 
after his death. 
  At 0906 GMT, President al-Asad arrives at the site of the 
ceremony where he was welcomed by Lebanese President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Lebanese 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and senior Syrian 
officials. 
  President al-Asad, wearing sunglasses, then takes his seat 
in 
a pavilion overlooking an open area in which thousands of people 
are gathered to mark this occasion. Behind him, hundreds of 
officials and dignitaries are sitting in rows. Basil's tomb, in 
the middle of the ceremony area, is covered with flowers. 
  Al-Asad is flanked on his right by Lebanese President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi and on his left by Lebanese Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Nabih Birri. Ba'th Party Assistant Secretary General 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar and Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam sit 
next to Nabih Birri. Al-Asad's son Dr. Bashshar and Lebanese 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri sit next to al-Hirawi. 
  After the recitation of Koranic verses, Sulayman Qaddah, the 
assistant secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
delivered the Ba'th Party speech at 0912 GMT. Qaddah begins by 
praising President Hafiz al-Asad's leadership and achievements 
and the Syrian people's support for the president. He then 
speaks about Basil, his characteristics, and the Syrians' sorrow 
on his loss. 
  Lebanon's Nabih Birri then addressed the ceremony at 0930 
GMT. After praising Basil al-Asad, and enumerating his many 
qualities and offering condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad, 
Birri speaks about the Beirut church explosion and the Hebron 
mosque massacre, saying "Israel, using sinful hands, has 
perpetrated a new crime against a house of God in the heart of 
Lebanon." Birri adds: "It is no coincidence that only 50 hours 
separated the two crimes committed against peace in both Lebanon 
and the region. One of these crimes targeted faithful people 
and the church in Lebanon and the other targeted faithful people 
and the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron." 
  Birri adds: "The blood bath witnessed in the holy lands of 
Palestine and Lebanon are the best evidence that Israel is 
incapable of making peace." 
  He then criticizes world reaction to these two incidents, 
noting that "Despite this bloody Israeli record, we still feel 
that Israel is granted immunity by the international community. 
It is allowed to act as it wishes, depending on the right of 
veto, which is preventing the passage of firm international 
resolutions and the implementation of the provisions enshrined 
in Chapter 7 of the UN Charter against it. This renders the 
killing of our peoples, as is happening at present, a condonable 
crime, and the killing of a single Israeli settler or soldier on 
our occupied territories an unforgivable crime. Their 
occupation of our territories is justified, whereas our 
resistance on our own national soil is deemed terrorism." 
  At 0940 GMT, Safwan Qudsi, secretary general of the Arab 
Socialist Union and member of the National Progressive Front 
[NPF] delivers the NPF speech. His entire speech is devoted to 
eulogizing Basil and praising President al-Asad. 
  At 1000 GMT, 'Adil al-Yaziji reads a poem eulogizing Basil 
al-Asad on behalf of famous Arab poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri. 
  At 1006 GMT, General Mustafa Talas, the deputy commander in 
chief of the Syrian Armed Forces and Army, deputy prime 
minister, and defense minister delivers a speech on behalf of 
the Armed Forces, in which he praises Basil as a courageous 
soldier, an ingenious engineer, and an intrepid knight. Talas, 
and after offering condolences to al-Asad says: "We all ask God 
Almighty to spare you calamities and to keep you a refuge for 
this nation after the Judas of the 20th Century has sold out 
this nation's principal cause in the labyrinths of Oslo." He 
adds that the Israelis then "dared to slaughter this nation's 
worshipers in the Ibrahimi Mosque on a Friday during Ramadan, in 
the same manner that they dared to attack the Sayyidat al-Najat 
Church in Beirut on that bloody Sunday in an overt attempt to 
cover up for their first crime". 
  At 1023 GMT, Elie Farzali, deputy speaker of the Lebanese 
Chamber of Deputies, reads a poem in praise of Basil al-Asad, 
after which he praises President al-Asad's pan-Arab policies, 
and says that the Lebanese people appreciate Syria's support for 
Lebanon and its stand at the peace negotiations "which does not 
differentiate between the regaining of southern Lebanon and the 
regaining of the Syrian Golan, between the interests of Beirut 
and the interests of Damascus." 
  At 1035 GMT Ahmad Kaftaru, mufti of the Syrian Arab 
Republic, 
delivers speech on behalf of the Muslim men of religion, also 
eulogizing Basil al-Asad. 
  At 1048 GMT, Lebanese poet Najib Jamal-al-Din recites a 
poem.

for knowledge.

the Lebanese Higher Shiite Islamic Council chairman, delivers 
speech, and at 1133 GMT, poet Hamid Hasan reads a poem.

Hafiz al-Asad's support for the Lebanese and Palestinian people, 
and his deep understanding of the Middle East crisis, and 
criticizing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
  At 1201 GMT, Mufti of Lebanon Rashid Qabbani takes the 
podium 
to deliver speech. As part of his praise of al-Asad and Syria, 
Qabbani recounts how Syria supports the Palestinian cause, how 
it has helped the Lebanese settle their differences, and how it 
assists them in their negotiations with Israel. 
  At 1213 GMT, Iraqi poet Dr. Mustafa Jamal al-Din recites a 
poem, and at 1239 GMT the exiled Bishop of Jerusalem Hilarion 
Capucci delivers speech. 
  At 1253 GMT, Lebanese Ulema Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah 
addresses the audience. He discusses the importance of 
"patience" as one of the manifestations of "freedom." He 
praises Syria and notes how it has managed to face all world 
challenges and "Zionist challenges" because Syria knows the 
nation has many elements of strength and positive points that 
can help it face all challenges. Syria managed to assert its 
role. He says that some people are in a rush to normalize 
relations with Israel and to drop the Israeli boycott, citing 
new world realities as a reason for this. He says that Syria's 
wise leadership -- al-Asad being a man with a strategic mind -- 
depends on "accurate tactics." He says: "We appreciated your 
stand, Your Excellency the president, when the U.S. President 
spoke to you about terrorism, resistance in Lebanon, and the 
intifadah in Palestine. You spoke to him about the Americans 
when they stood in the face of the Britons." He highly praises

Palestine."

  At 1446 GMT, Bashshar al-Asad delivers a speech on behalf of 
the family in which he thanks the Syrians and the Arabs for 
their honest feelings and the national unity they embodied. He 
also thanks all those who attended the memorial service. 
  At 1452 GMT, Damascus Mufti Shaykh Bashir 'Id al-Bari 
concludes the eulogy by an appeal to God, and then the linkup 
ends at 1500 GMT. 
  At 1530 GMT, Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Television

<F P=106> [Speech by Lebanese Hizballah Spiritual Leader Shaykh </F>
Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah at a ceremony eulogizing Basil al-Asad 
40 days after his death, held in al-Qardahah, Syria, in the 
presence of Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We have noticed, and we do not 
want to accuse anyone, that there are a number of groups in this 
nation who are in a hurry to achieve peace, in a hurry to 
achieve normalization before peace, in a hurry to lift the 
economic boycott, and in a hurry about everything. This is 
because they have the new world order in mind, and because they 
want to tell you something about the new world situation. They 
speak about all this because they are frightened. So, they want 
to achieve security quickly from here and there. 
  However, we see that the wise leadership in Syria, 
represented by President Hafiz al-Asad, has a strategic mind. I 
know him as a man who has in his awareness the history of his 
nation and more. He studies this history and takes from it all 
the bright points in order to illuminate all this new darkness. 
This is out of his concern for the nation's strategy, that his 
tactics may create a stand that people may term moderate or as 
making small concessions here and there, for enlightened and 
accurate tactics can never cancel strategy. 
  We appreciated your stand, Your Excellency the president, 
when the U.S. President spoke to you about terrorism, resistance 
in Lebanon, and the intifadah in Palestine. You spoke to him 
about the Americans when they stood in the face of the Britons. 
What stand did they have? Neither this aura with which the 
U.S. President is trying to surround himself, nor this new world 
order prevented you from doing all this. This is because you 
believe that we are a strong nation, and that we all must, in 
our media, politics, and economy, work to concentrate the 
elements of strength in this nation in order to produce new 
elements. 
  We need a cultural battle that instills in the nation the 
deep values that enable it to expand. We also need a political 
battle that prevents the nation from collapsing before 
intimidation from here and there, but gives it confidence in 
itself rather than borrowing it from here and there. The issue, 
which we are experiencing now, and which we feel that the wise 
leadership is now making clear, is that the international news 
media, and maybe some of our own political media, claim that 
peace will cause the collapse of the Arab nation because Israel 
possesses creative economic capabilities, creative genius, the 
strength, and the international cover, It calls on the Arabs to 
prepare for collapse and arrange their matters with the Israeli 
train after you arrange your matters with the U.S. train. This 
is as if the nation has lost its energy, and as if the nation 
has no political, economic, or media creativity. The nation has 
a lot of all this creativity. A nation that has created 
civilization throughout history can build civilization at times 
of war and peace. The question is to be patient, to study 
matters carefully, to study the situation carefully, and to 
study the future carefully so that we will be free with Imam 
Ja'far al-Sadiq, may God peace be upon him, who says: A free 
man is free in all his affairs. He is patient over all 
catastrophes, and if all catastrophes befall him will not be 
able to break or coerce him. 
  Mr. President, you have proven that you are a free man in a 
world that wants to enslave itself before others enslave it. 
Catastrophes might befall you, whether they are personal or 
public, in order to try to defeat your steadfastness, to 
suppress you, and to prevent you from pursuing this long march. 
We believe that in your experience with the nation, you were 
the man who could not be defeated by catastrophes or challenges. 
Based on this, we believe that you still have the awareness of 
the free men. We feel that you constitute the force that has 
stood strong, despite all the negative political and security 
aspects, with the resistance in Lebanon, and has also stood 
strongly with the intifadah in Palestine, because you know that 
resistance in Lebanon and the intifadah are the bright points 
amid this darkness. Therefore, we are with you concerning the 
overall issue of freedom. We are with you concerning the issue 
of challenge. We also agree with you that the nation must 
continue to be lofty, zealous, and firm. We are also with you 
in all stands that necessitate open awareness and a strong will 
to see in you the man who does not care about what others say, 
but cares about what the nation says, a man who does not care 
about others' challenges, but cares about the challenges of 
building the nation on strong bases. In light of this, we 
believe that, in your great sadness, you were the great patient 
man. He who has the nation's zeal in his mind and heart has the 
zeal of patience in his emotions and stands. We beseech Almighty 
God to preserve you for this nation, and to have mercy on the 
soul of the deceased. May God make paradise be his final abode, 
and grant you and the nation patience and great requital. May 
God's peace and blessing be upon you.

  [Text] New York -- Syria has stressed that the horrendous 
Hebron massacre falls within the framework of the Israeli 
occupation and settlement policy, which is in violation of all 
laws and UN resolutions. 
  Addressing the Security Council last night, Syrian UN 
Representative Husayn 'Awwad said Israel's intransigent attitude 
and expansionist policies, which have persisted since the start 
of the Middle East peace talks in Madrid in 1991, are either 
directly or indirectly responsible for regional extremism. He 
added that Israel has been playing a dual game since the start 
of the Middle East peace process and that the Hebron massacre is 
part of an organized and planned operation, not an individual 
act as asserted by Israel. The government of Israel bears 
responsibility for this massacre, he added. 
  'Awwad said that unless the United States and Russia, the 
cosponsors of the peace process, intervene for the sake of 
reaching a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution in the 
Middle East, Israel will then implement Yitzhaq Shamir's 
slogans, which he summed up in the following phrase: Negotiate 
with the Arabs for years, but do not allow these talks to 
produce any results.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial headlined "The Peace Process Is at 
a Crucial Turning Point," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Yitzhaq 
Rabin's statements these days are of no use to the peace 
process. Rabin tells settlers that there will be no Palestinian 
state, that the settlements illegally established in the 
occupied territories will not be dismantled, that there will be 
no withdrawal from occupied Jerusalem, that Israel will not 
abandon its racism, and that Israel will not recognize the 
Palestinian people's national rights. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: At the same time, Rabin is being generous to 
the world public opinion by giving it some analgesics by saying 
that 1994 will be the year of achieving peace in the Middle East. 
  AL-BA'TH says: Rabin came with his party majority to the 
Knesset under the banner of peace to replace Shamir, who 
obstructed, hampered, and froze the peace process, and brought 
tension to U.S.- Israeli relations with his crude rejection of 
U.S. proposals. It is known that the most important promises 
Rabin gave to Israeli voters -- who are sick of the policy of 
wars, military invasions, occupation of others' land, rebellion 
against international legitimacy, and rejection of several 
initiatives to establish peace in the region -- was his 
commitment to deviate from Shamir's method and to cooperate with 
the United States to reactivate the peace process and to enable 
it to achieve its objectives. 
  The paper says: Had it not been for the Geneva meeting 
between President Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its 
positive results which paved the way for embarking on new 
attempts to resume the peace talks, these talks would have 
remained frozen, not to say halted. 
  The paper clarifies: Every time Syria removes an Israeli 
mine from the road of peace, Rabin's government plants new 
mines. Every time Syria makes a step to push the peace process 
forward, Israel takes several steps backward. These steps have 
forced it to leave the peace process and its talks in Washington 
for the corridors of secret talks in Oslo. 
  The paper holds Rabin and his government fully responsible 
for obstructing and foiling the peace talks in Washington and 
for planting mines on their road. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Unless the Israeli obstacles are 
seriously and decisively surmounted, the peace process will 
continue to be exposed to further erosion, destruction, and 
collapse, and the talk about peace, stability, and security in 
the region will be sheer imagination and deception. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Israeli officials often 
resort to making provocative and skeptical statements to play 
down the importance of the peace process and to give pessimistic 
impressions about the possibility of reaching a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. They try to draw a very 
dark and melancholic picture for the future of the peace process 
in order to achieve their objective of making others believe 
that peace can only be achieved in accordance with the Israeli 
concept, namely, that the Arabs should relinquish their land and 
rights and accept partial solutions and separate deals tailored 
in accordance with Israel's expansionist objectives. The paper 
quotes a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin in Madrid in which he described the peace talks as being a 
bazaar and a commercial deal. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: If this is Yitzhaq Rabin's concept of the 
talks, no one can be optimistic about the approach of peace. 
Neither can anyone claim the peace talks are proceeding in the 
right direction. 
  The paper clarifies: Peace, in its humanitarian sense, 
cannot be compared with a commercial deal that is subject to 
compromise and blackmail and which can take place at the expense 
of one party. Such a description shows a backward mentality that 
is not in harmony with the contemporary international trend that 
considers peace a pressing need necessitated by security, 
stability, and justice in the world. 
  Concluding, the paper says: If Rabin attacks Syria due to 
its insistence on the need for a just and comprehensive peace in 
the Middle East, due to its rejection of partial solutions and 
separate deals, and due to its commitment to restoring the 
occupied Arab territories in full, he should realize that 
Syria's policy will continue to be clear and firm, and that no 
one can divert it from its objectives and principles.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: Given the enormity 
and monstrousness of the Hebron mosque massacre, it was only 
natural for the Arab delegations to suspend the Washington 
bilateral talks to protest the massacre and demonstrate 
solidarity with the Palestinian Arab people. 
  The paper adds: It is illogical for the negotiating process 
to remain at Israel's mercy, and hostage to its bloody crimes. 
Likewise, it should be unreasonable for the Arabs to continue to 
conduct the negotiations on the basis of commitment to the peace 
process when the Israelis are free of any obligations or 
commitments. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: In its open war, Israel has been 
engaged in programmed terrorism, in a war of extermination and 
destruction in the name of peace. The Arabs are always asked 
not to protest to avoid inflaming emotions, and so that the 
peace process may not be undermined. To put it bluntly, the 
Arabs alone are asked to show flexibility, exercise restraint, 
and receive blows to maintain the momentum in the peace process 
as if the Arabs alone are the party concerned with this process. 
The Arabs are perceived as the party that must reward Israel 
and make concessions that consecrate the usurpation of Arab 
territories and rights, as well as submission to Israeli 
dictates and domination. 
  The paper says: Had Israel been in the Arabs' shoes; namely, 
had it been the victim receiving blows and the target of daily 
air raids and shelling, in which the most sophisticated weapons 
are used, and had the massacre struck a Jewish synagogue instead 
of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque or the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, 
certainly the reaction of the West, and the United States in 
particular, would not have been so timid or confined to 
condemnation and denunciation. Had this been the case, the Arabs 
would have become the target of a sweeping campaign. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: Undoubtedly, the 
shocking and horrendous Hebron massacre has turned many concepts 
upside down and changed many things. Thanks to this massacre, 
it has become difficult to continue the bilateral talks, or 
resume them as if nothing has happened. Salvaging the peace 
process and the stalled peace talks requires the application of 
all sorts of pressures on Israel to make it honor the relevant 
international legitimacy resolutions and conventions, respect 
human rights, dismantle settlements, disarm settlers, and return 
to the Arabs all their territories and rights.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "International Protection for the Palestinians </F>
and the Reprehensible U.S. Stand"] 
  [Text] After six days of ongoing UN Security Council 
meetings, it has become obvious that the United States is the 
side which is trying to prevent the issuance of an international 
resolution holding Israel responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and compelling it to accept international observers 
that would provide some international protection for the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  This stand which placates Israel is a continuation of the 
U.S. policy adopted for decades by the successive U.S. 
administrations. This has encouraged Israel to pursue its human 
rights violations in the occupied territories, and has placed it 
above the law, and out of reach of any possible international 
inquiry. 
  Following the Hebron massacre that has been condemned by the 
entire international community, the current U.S. Administration 
under the pretext of not endangering the peace process, adopts a 
stand that lacks wisdom and far-sightedness when it seeks to 
prevent the implementation of the international community's will 
and the UN Security Council from responding to these calls which 
demand some kind of international protection for the 
Palestinians. 
  Does the Clinton administration need more than this torrent 
of innocent blood that was shed in the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip last Friday to be convinced that a defenseless people need 
some kind of international protection, especially since 
Israel--army, border guard, and fanatic settlers, persist in 
shedding the blood of children, elderly people, and women 
without remorse and without fearing any possible international 
inquiry? 
  The issuance of a UN Security Council resolution providing 
the Palestinian people with international protection is another 
test of the seriousness of the U.S. role as a fair mediator in 
the Middle East crisis, how ethically credible it is, and how 
genuine are its continued claims that it defends human rights 
throughout the world.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Killers, Not Victims"] </F>
  [Text] World Zionism and its military tool, the Israeli 
entity, have been established against the background of a great 
lie; namely, the world's persecution of the Jews and the 
Europeans' alleged massacres of them. The Ramadan massacre, 
which was committed by a rancorous Zionist Jew at dawn last 
Friday, is one more piece of evidence to be added to hundreds of 
other pieces of evidence, which all prove that the persecution 
of the Jews was a big lie. This evidence exposes to the entire 
world the falsehood of the Zionist allegations that have been 
used to extort the West, which later adopted them to vent its 
wrath against the Arabs and Muslims. 
  The political Israeli condemnation of the Ramadan massacre 
does not absolve the Israeli entity from direct responsibility 
for this massacre. What Rabin has said is not enough to deny 
his joy over seeing the Palestinian blood spilt over the floor 
of the Ibrahimi Mosque or to deny his happiness with that racist 
action by a Jew who was brought up according to a rancorous 
Torah ideology that views the Arab as the target at which all 
rifles must be aimed and the Muslim as a potential victim that 
must be chased until shot dead. There is no difference between 
Rabin, Sharon, Shamir, and the Zionist killer with his American 
and Jewish roots. There is no difference between the 
Palestinian being killed by regular soldiers or by settlers who 
carry all the instruments of death, except the military uniform. 
It is natural for the Zionist school to produce all those 
killers whose hands are stained with the blood of the 
Palestinian people and whose nails have torn our flesh, which 
has been scorched by their warplanes, tanks, and bombs. 
  Besides, the world which happily watches massacres and is 
pleased to see peoples being torn apart by troubles and 
tragedies, cannot change from one massacre to another. It is 
hard, therefore, to believe that those who committed the 
massacre at the al-'Amiriyah shelter in Baghdad can be sincere 
in their sentiments toward the Ramadan massacre in Hebron. It 
is hard to expect them to be committed to ethics and values 
where the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is concerned, while Muslims 
are being subjected to daily massacres, rape, death, hunger, and 
disease in Yugoslavia and behind the racist wall erected by the 
United States and its allies around the Iraqi people and their 
children's right to milk and their sick people's right to 
medicine. 
  The Ramadan massacre by the Jews and their allies, the 
enemies of the Palestinian rights and people, the enemies of all 
Arabs and Muslims is not the exception, but the rule. 
Therefore, it will be difficult for us to believe the West's 
condemnation of the massacre unless it is coupled by real action 
which punishes the aggressor, works to establish a just peace, 
and puts an end to the Jewish allegations about their having 
been subjected to massacres and persecution.

<F P=106> ["The Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "What </F>
Cultural Normalization!"] 
  [Text] Cultural normalization with Israel seems to be all 
the rage now -- for both local and Arab intellectuals. It was a 
real issue at the recent elections of the Jordanian Writers 
Association and continues to engage the attention of a good many 
Arab intellectuals. For most of them, it seems that to hold our 
ground culturally makes up for the setbacks we have suffered on 
the battle front over the past four decades. 
  In fact, with an impending normalization in the military, 
economic, commercial, tourist, and water spheres, I cannot see 
how it will be possible to resist cultural normalization. 
  How will it be possible to buck the trend for cultural 
normalization when economic normalization will bring Israel 
right to the core of our lives and channels will open wide 
between our mortal, permanent enemy and ourselves? 
  Are we to bar access to the Israeli newspapers, counsel our 
viewers and listeners against tuning in to Israeli television 
and radio networks, and ostracize whoever reads a poem composed 
by an Israeli author or a literary work translated from Hebrew? 
  I, for one, am prepared to observe a decision to combat 
cultural normalization. But will local and Arab intellectuals 
show me and other like-minded persons the way to put this 
decision into practice? 
  I will admit that in this age of satellite communications, 
the world is now virtually a global village and culture is a 
universal and global concern. However, I take issue with some 
intellectuals who are falling all over themselves to become 
familiar with Israeli literary works and figures. 
  How are we to combat cultural normalization when Israeli 
television gate-crashes our homes, when our radios are 
continually tuned in to Israeli stations, and practically every 
Jordanian and Arab daily runs a full page translated from one 
Israeli paper or another? 
  Would it promote the cause of the fight against cultural 
normalization, if we were to march through the streets tomorrow 
and demand that Arab Education Ministries keep the same 
curricula and not tell our children that Israel now belongs in 
the camp of our friends? 
  This may be one way to further this cause. However, assuming 
that Israel will continue to be viewed as an enemy in our school 
curricula, we must realize that an Arab child encountering 
Israelis and handling Israeli toys and candies is bound to be 
confused and perplexed. 
  Normalization is normalization; we can't be selective. It is 
pointless and meaningless to combat cultural normalization when 
we press ahead with normalization in military, economic and 
other areas, and when our intellectuals seem keen to read 
whatever is being turned out by Israel's mass media.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cutting Short the Bilateral Negotiations"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Arab parties' move of 
cutting short the bilateral negotiations in Washington can be 
understood as a natural response that has been dictated by the 
repercussions of the horrendous Zionist massacre in Hebron and 
by the need to pause for a while to reconsider this course. 
After over two years of negotiations, the Israeli Government 
did not budge from its obstinate stands. Rather, it persisted 
in intransigence. 
  Had the Washington negotiations led to any tangible and 
practical results, or had they heralded such an outcome in the 
foreseeable future, then we could have said that the Arab 
parties' move of cutting short the negotiations was a prize for 
the Zionist extremists, who did not hesitate to publicly declare 
their desire to abort this process. But since the negotiations 
became an end in themselves, then cutting them short now or 
suspending them in the future will not much change the general 
standoff characterizing the talks. 
  It seems that the Arab parties were in need of such a 
dreadful shock so that they might wake up from the dream of 
running after the mirage of the Washington negotiations and from 
the effects of Israel's unrestrained policy all this time. The 
Arab parties need to pause a while to catch their breath and 
reconsider this futile negotiatory course. They should use this 
time to reunite their stands, coordinate their negotiating 
policies more effectively, and work to achieve some of the basic 
requirements for the return to Washington. This is in order to 
achieve what is hoped from these negotiations, which have 
consumed a great deal of time and effort and resulted in more 
inter-Arab doubts and differences.

  [Text] Today, Walid 'Asfur, minister of energy and mineral 
resources, and Radi Ibrahim, minister of supply, each received 
Mr. Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, Egypt's minister of economy and 
foreign trade. The sessions addressed bilateral ties and ways 
to develop them further. 
  Mr. 'Asfur and Mr. Mahmud reviewed bilateral cooperation in 
the areas of energy and mineral resources and the progress made 
in linking Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt in an 
electricity grid. They discussed the electricity grid link 
between Jordan and Egypt as part of the five-state chain. They 
also talked about the use of renewable energy and tapping solar 
energy for heating and power generating purposes. Also 
discussed was cooperation in harnessing wind to generate 
electricity. Jordan already has two such stations in 
al-Ibrahimiyah and Jurf al-Darawish and, in cooperation with 
Germany, is working on a third with a 1.2 megawatt capacity. 
  Radi Ibrahim and the Egyptian minister met to discuss trade 
and the supply situation between the two countries. The 
Jordanian minister briefed the Egyptian minister and his 
delegation on his ministry's activities. Ibrahim told the 
Egyptian minister he would like to see bilateral trade 
increased, observing that, in the past, the exchanges lacked 
stability. Noting that the Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian 
Committee is due to convene after 'Id al-Fitr, the minister 
pointed to the need to draw up guidelines to boost bilateral 
trade. 
  The Egyptian minister stressed the need to boost economic 
ties with Jordan and called for pan-Arab economic integration. 
He lauded the Ministry of Supply's key function of making basic 
food items available and stabilizing prices.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Justifiability in Halting Words"] </F>
  [Text] Saturday's [26 February] decision by Jordan, Syria 
and Lebanon to suspend peace talks with Israel in reaction to 
Friday's massacre of Palestinian worshippers at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron, had to expected. The trauma and anguish 
caused by the progrom have made it extremely difficult for the 
Arab side to continue the negotiations on business-as-usual 
basis. A halt to the Washington talks was inevitable. 
  His Majesty King Husayn told members of Parliament Saturday 
that a decision to withdraw from the negotiations was not up to 
Jordan alone, but rather a collective Arab position that needed 
to be carefully taken. Now that a solemn decision has been 
taken, the PLO too can be expected to stick to its demands for 
protection of Palestinians under occupation before talks can be 
resumed in any manner or form. 
  Judging by the deliberations of the U.N. Security Council on 
a draft resolution on the Hebron massacre, the likelihood of an 
agreement among the permanent members for the establishment of 
an international regime for the protection of Palestinians looks 
dim. With the council's inability to move effectively in that 
direction due to opposition from Washington and London in 
particular, the chances of the PLO acepting without any question 
U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to both sides to take 
part in a continuous session in Washington till a breakthrough 
is attained look also bleak. 
  France's alternative proposal to place international 
observers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to monitor the 
situation there may offer a middle ground that could be 
acceptable to both sides. Such an initiative could be a nucleus 
for greater international role in the occupied territories and 
deserves careful consideration. If accepted, the idea could be 
a modest beginning of a process that may prove unstoppable. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has yet to address the 
French proposal and most probably he would reject it. PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat, on the other hand, saw some merits in it 
and did not rule it out of hand. 
  The worthiness of the French idea lies in the fact that the 
other permanent members of the Security Council could find it 
workable under the circumstances. Besides, the Arab side is not 
exactly in a mood, politically or emotionally, to resume peace 
efforts as if nothing had happened. Something meaningful has to 
be adopted therefore as an effetive antidote to the massacre 
before Arab- Israeli negotiations can be put on track again.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 2 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
reiterated Egypt's denunciation of the massacre at the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron, which he described as the epitome of cruelty 
and extremism. President Mubarak noted that he is following up 
the situation and the contacts held with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat, and the Israeli 
president and prime minister. 
  During an expanded meeting held at the presidential office 
today, President Mubarak stressed that Egypt urges the 
international community to adopt a clear-cut decision to back 
the Palestinian people's right to protection under international 
law, disarm the settlers, and take an interest in the security 
requirements of the Palestinian people to ensure the security 
and safety of Palestinian civilians. 
  Following the three-hour meeting, Information Minister 
Safwat 
al-Sharif stated that its purpose was to discuss domestic 
affairs on which the president gave instructions at an earlier 
meeting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Dr. Usamah al-Baz, advisor to </F>
President Mubarak, by Smadar Peri in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. Usamah al-Baz, the Egyptian president's 
confidential counselor, has no patience for small talk. He 
hates formalities, cocktail parties, and tuxedos. He is witty, 
quick, and possesses a keen mind and excellent memory. He is 
the man who carries out the overt, and mainly covert missions, 
on behalf of President Mubarak, with whom he has been working 
since 1975, from the day Mubarak took off his Air Force uniform 
and became the vice president of Egypt. 
  Al-Baz, an international relations expert, graduated from 
Harvard. He returned to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry as its 
director general with a fluent command of English, ready to work 
around the clock. Of all things, he relaxes to the sounds of 
pop music. Behind his back he is called "the mercury," because 
he does not suffer fools gladly and quickly dispenses with 
"nudnicks," nuisances, and anybody who does not stimulate his 
intellectual curiosity. 
  He is the architect of the rapprochement between the PLO and 
Egypt, and is credited with the reconciliation between 
Presidents al-Asad and Mubarak. He has accumulated dozens, 
perhaps thousands of "al-Asad hours." And, he is very familiar 
with Israel. Israeli politics interest him, the names of our 
decisionmakers and our senior and junior advisers are familiar 
to him. 
  [Peri] Mr. al-Baz, President 'Ezer Weizman and Prime 
Minister Rabin hesitated about the appropriateness of sending 
their condolences to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad over the 
death of his son Basil. They hesitated, but finally sent them. 
  [Al-Baz] And I am telling you: there was no room for 
hesitation. Their decision was right, important, and very wise. 
The Syrians appreciated the gesture. 
  [Peri] How do you know? 
  [Al-Baz] I know, and I will not elaborate. How should I put 
it? I met some Syrians, and they told me that they greatly 
appreciated President Weizman's condolences. They were 
pleasantly surprised. See, they look at you as one human being 
looks at another. The moment a bereaved father, whose son was 
killed in an horrendous car accident -- which is the tragic case 
of President Weizman -- shares in the grief of another bereaved 
father -- that is, the Syrian president, who also lost his son 
in similar circumstances -- the message is heard. 
  [Peri] You knew Basil al-Asad and you know President al-Asad 
very well. How did his son's death affect him? 
  [Al-Baz] There is no room for political conclusions. This 
is a human tragedy; a tragedy for the president, for the Syrian 
people, and for all of us. Basil al-Asad was not just the son of 
the president, but was a special personality. He was a likable 
and talented man whose future lay ahead of him. However, as I 
said before, there is no room to derive political conclusions. 
  [Peri] If so, let us talk about the political issue. What 
al- Asad demands from Israel is clear: a withdrawal from the 
entire Golan Heights. But what exactly will he give in return? 
  [Al-Baz] I do not like the question so much, and I will tell 
you why. In my opinion, this is the wrong formula. You are 
making a mistake by listing your conditions in advance. I 
believe that if Israel is prepared to give Syria the entire 
Golan, Syria will make full peace with Israel. 
  [[Peri] What is full peace? 
  [Al-Baz] Something that resembles the peace between Israel 
and Egypt. 
  [Peri] If so, we are in for a cold peace. 
  [Al-Baz] I object to the term cold peace. However, if you 
insist, I am prepared to promise you that the peace between 
Israel and Syria will be a "cold-plus peace" because it will be 
based on the Egyptian model, but will not be a separate peace. 
If you conclude a peace agreement with Syria this year, as we 
expect, and peace is also attained with Jordan and Lebanon, the 
entire Arab perception will change. That is why the peace with 
Syria is "doomed" to be much warmer. 
  [Peri] To tell you the truth, you are not convincing me. To 
this day, President al-Asad has even refused to promise that he 
will open an embassy in Israel. 
  [Al-Baz] Your tactics are wrong. I would like to remind you 
that also in the case of the peace with Egypt nobody asked us to 
promise in advance what the nature of the relations would be. 
Not even in Camp David. This happened on its own, at the last 
minute. After all, many of our countrymen objected to President 
al-Sadat's historic visit to Jerusalem. 
  Therefore, there was no room to make any promises then about 
diplomatic relations in exchange for a withdrawal from the 
Sinai. Had pressure been exerted on us at an early stage, 
opposition would have been greater and this might have hurt the 
process. I propose that you think about what I am saying now. 
I suggest you not to pressure the Syrians. 
  [Peri] How can you, who are a sort of "liaison" between 
Israel and Syria, suggest to us to withdraw from the Golan 
without offering us anything in return? 
  [Al-Baz] I believe that when all is said and done people in 
your country realize that Israel will announce its willingness 
to withdraw from the entire Golan Heights.... 
  [Peri] The entire Golan Heights? And what about the Israeli 
settlements? 
  [Al-Baz] They will have to be removed at some stage, as was 
the case with the withdrawal from the Sinai. 
  I do not want to speak for the Syrians. You may reach an 
arrangement with them whereby certain Israelis can remain there 
as individuals. However, they would have to live under Syrian 
sovereignty, obey Syrian law and the local police. I am not 
sure many Israelis will accede to it. 
  If you really want to know the meaning of the full peace 
al-Asad is talking about, you must enter serious negotiations 
with the Syrian delegation in Washington and demand clear 
answers. 
  [Peri] But the head of our delegation, Ambassador Itamar 
Rabinovich, complains that his colleague, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, 
has been evading the issue. 
  [Al-Baz] I should like to point out that Rabinovich is an 
excellent choice. He is one of your best diplomats. He is an 
academic whose heart is in the right place. He is smart and 
moderate. He has no hang-ups or prejudices that inhibit him 
from making contacts. He is the man best suited to prompt the 
other side to change its attitude toward Israel. 
  [Peri] Have the Syrians changed their attitude toward us? 
Who are we in their eyes? 
  [Al-Baz] I have been following the public debate in your 
country as to whether the Arabs can and should be trusted. I 
believe there is no room for such an argument, because dealing 
with such theories always leads to confusion and to conclusions 
that are inconsistent with the constantly changing situation. 
  [Peri] Let me rephrase my question: When you discuss 
Prime Minister Rabin with President al-Asad, do you get the 
impression that al-Asad believes him? 
  [Al-Baz] I suppose President al-Asad has not yet asked 
himself whether he does or does not believe Rabin. My feeling 
is that al-Asad believes he can "do business" with Rabin and 
conduct give-and-take negotiations with him. My impression is 
that al-Asad has no inhibitions or hang-ups with regard to 
Rabin. The entire Arab world knows that the Labor government 
came to power with a peace program. 
  [Peri] Nevertheless, he refuses to meet Rabin. 
  [Al-Baz] At this point, there is no sense in such a meeting. 
On the contrary, think what would happen if they met and nothing 
came out of it. This would do a lot of damage to the process. 
  We have experience with summit meetings. President al-Sadat 
went to Jerusalem, Haifa, and Beersheba. Your prime minister 
came to Ismailia and the process almost came to a halt. Then he 
visited Cairo, Aswan, and Alexandria. They also met in Sharm 
al-Shaykh, and this meeting too was unnecessary and almost led 
to an explosion. 
  Peace was ultimately brought about by our delegations, which 
sat together with the Americans and conducted negotiations. 
  [Peri] Rabin is pressuring for such a meeting based on the 
assumption that a tete-a-tete session with al-Asad will create a 
common language and will affect public opinion, both in Syria 
and in Israel. 
  [Al-Baz] Based on my acquaintance with both of them, I 
believe they are the best candidates for a summit meeting. They 
are both brave leaders who are prepared to take responsibility 
and make tough decisions. I believe the right chemistry will be 
created between them when they meet, but I do not think such a 
meeting will result in a peace agreement. 
  [Peri] Who do you find it easier to negotiate with: Rabin, 
who is famous for his security awareness, or Peres, with his 
vision about peace and a green Middle East? 
  [Al-Baz] To tell you the truth, despite the differences in 
their personalities, I find it easy to deal with both of them. 
It is good that they are totally different from their 
predecessors, the Likud people. Your previous government was 
made up of introverts. They never bothered to tell us what they 
thought should be done, what was troubling them, or what their 
plans were. 
  [Peri] What is the difference between Peres and Rabin? 
  [Al-Baz] Rabin does not talk as much as Shim'on. Peres 
enjoys lecturing about the future, about his vision. He has a 
treasure trove of ideas. Rabin is much more cautious about what 
he says. I suppose he is conscious of the responsibility he 
shoulders, not just in his capacity as prime minister, but also 
as the highest-ranking man in charge of the security of the 
State of Israel. My impression is that Rabin is more of an 
introvert than Peres, but when we talk he does not keep quiet. 
He definitely responds, although he does not initiate 
conversation. When one succeeds in stimulating him to talk, he 
definitely talks. 
  It was interesting to find out that both have similar 
perceptions about the future, although Peres, much more than 
Rabin, is willing to go into details. Peres has dreams and he 
is willing to share them with you. Rabin focuses on the 
question of what can be achieved within reason. They are both 
thinking men, the difference being that Rabin is a cerebral man, 
whereas Peres goes after his imagination and heart. It should 
be pointed out that both of them are open to ideas and are not 
stuck on old conceptions. 
  The problem is that Rabin does not give you an answer on the 
spot. He prefers to take his time, perhaps to consult with his 
men. Peres responds immediately. 
  [Peri] Is that also the way you "sell" them to the leaders 
of the Arab world? 
  [Al-Baz] I most definitely do not sell them. We usually 
present the picture, the political mood in your country. We 
present Rabin and Peres differently than we presented the Likud 
government. We tell them that their responses are direct and 
that they say what is on their mind without hiding anything, 
whereas their predecessors did not even bother to tell us either 
yes or no. 
  There is yet another important difference between Rabin and 
Peres and the Likud people: It seems to me that they respect 
the Arabs and that, contrary to their predecessors, they do not 
deride them, their culture and mentality. They do not feel 
superior to the Arabs. Shamir, Sharon, Eytan, and Ge'ula Kohen 
did not even mean peace. Even Arens was careless with his 
pronouncements and managed to arouse anger. 
  [Peri] Probably, you also get reports about the rivalry 
between Rabin and Peres. 
  [Al-Baz] Even if theirs is a charged relationship, which I 
find natural, this is not reflected in the negotiations. Quite 
the contrary, I can attest to the collaboration between them. 
We talk to one, and the other picks up from the exact same 
point where the first one left off. 
  [Peri] What exactly is the role you play? Are you the man 
in charge of secret missions, a go-between? 
  [Al-Baz] I do not relay messages. We, the Egyptians, have a 
larger role. We are partners, we are involved. First of all, 
Syria is an Arab country with which we have an historic and 
strong relationship. We appreciate its importance in the Arab 
world, its security needs, and internal stability. Our security 
is linked to that of Syria. 
  It should be pointed out that Egypt and Syria have a mutual 
defense pact, and that when we talk about Syria we are talking 
about an ally. We have an obligation toward them, and vice 
versa, and we defend their position. 
  [Peri] Is there a red telephone line between President 
Mubarak and President al-Asad? 
  [Al-Baz] There is not. They speak on a regular phone. 
  [Peri] Perhaps you could share the secret with us: Why does 
every meeting with President al-Asad last so many hours? 
  [Al-Baz] President al-Asad is very meticulous about 
expressing his positions and opinions in clear terms. He is not 
just a politician, but also a statesman, and he has a lot of 
patience. In addition to that, he is particularly fond of 
history. He is well-versed in it, and he likes to cite examples 
from history to illustrate his position. I should like to point 
out that al-Asad is a good listener. I know very few statesmen 
endowed with the patience to listen to their fellow men. He 
poses you with a challenge and stimulates you to react, and he 
has plenty of patience to listen to your response. 
  [Peri] What is he interested in? What does he ask you about 
Israel? 
  [Al-Baz] He is interested in all the details: How the 
Israelis conducted the negotiations with Egypt, what can be 
expected of them, what motivates them, what are the differences 
in the political concepts of the Likud and Labor, and what is 
their attitude toward the Arab world. 
  [Peri] And what does he say when you tell him that the 
Israelis distrust his intentions and want proof of Syria's peace 
intentions? 
  [Al-Baz] I do not do that. It is not our position to speak 
in the name of Israel and say that "the Israelis want so and so 
from you...." 
  Also, I cannot possibly come to al-Asad and say that the 
Israelis want proof of the seriousness of his intentions. If I 
did that, it would mean that we shared Israeli suspicions that 
al-Asad does not want to live in peace with Israel. And, after 
all, that is not what we think. We think that he definitely 
wants peace. 
  [Peri] Does al-Asad really know us? 
  [Al-Baz] He knows you quite well, but I do not think there 
are any Arabs who know you better than we do. We know you 
first-hand, as do the Palestinians in the territories who 
understand you and your motives and require no explanations. We 
do not have to guess. 
  The Syrians know you better now than in the past because of 
the direct negotiations. And, you are right in reiterating the 
need for direct contacts between your leadership and the Syrian 
top leaders, but you should not insist or pressure. It will 
come. I am sure. 
  [Peri] If al-Asad is reluctant to personally meet Rabin, why 
should he not authorize his foreign minister, Faruq al-Shar', to 
meet secretly with Shim'on Peres? 
  [Al-Baz] It is a matter of principle for the Syrians not to 
have secret meetings. They distrust their purpose. What can be 
achieved in a secret meeting that cannot be attained in direct 
negotiations? Also, there is no sense in such a meeting because 
the talks between the delegations in Washington have not yet 
reached a stage that would justify upgrading the level of the 
meetings. 
  [Peri] You probably remember the secret meetings between the 
late Moshe Dayan and Hasan al-Tuhami in Morocco to prepare 
President al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem. 
  [Al-Baz] To this day I am not sure that those meetings paved 
al-Sadat's way. It is hard to tell what really happened there. 
I spoke with each of them separately, and each gave me his own 
version. That is exactly why secret meetings are unnecessary. 
  [Peri] We distrust al-Asad. He has been procuring weapons, 
calling for a "vague" peace, and operating Hizballah against us. 
  [Al-Baz] That distrust is exaggerated. I can very well 
understand your suspiciousness of the Syrians when they were 
your main enemy and procured weapons and missiles. The Syrians 
also distrust you. I suggest that you both stop distrusting 
each other. Syria has always meticulously honored its 
obligations to you. Your border with Syria is quiet. They do 
not threaten your security. 
  Even if they procure weapons, that is not the key issue. 
After all, you are doing the same thing, and you have not given 
up your nuclear option. Countries occasionally tend to improve 
their military balance in order to improve their bargaining 
position in negotiations, so as not to negotiate from a position 
of weakness. 
  [Peri] And what about Hizballah? The Syrians are not 
exactly stopping them from operating against us. 
  [Al-Baz] I would not say they "welcome" Hizballah's 
activities. At most, they "put up" with them. Neither Syria 
nor the Lebanese Government control them. I seriously doubt 
your argument that Syria supplies arms to Hizballah. Iran does, 
but Syria does not. Hizballah has its own methods. 
  [Peri] Many people in our country believe that al-Asad is 
not interested in Israel. He wants financial aid, U.S. backing, 
and to get Syria removed from the list of countries supporting 
international terror. 
  [Al-Baz] That is incorrect. Al-Asad is interested in 
Syria's security and internal stability, and as long as he has 
an Israeli enemy on the other side of the border he does not 
have full security and cannot afford to divert resources to 
development, industries, and agricultural projects. And, you 
must not forget, you are occupying some of his land. 
  And now I will say what I think is most important: Most 
Arabs already accept the existence of the State of Israel, both 
with their minds and hearts. My impression is that al-Asad 
recognizes Israel and wants to live with it in respectable peace. 
  [Peri] Based on your experience, could you please tell us 
what is the Syrian weakest point? What is it that we should not 
do? 
  [Al-Baz] Honor, you should not offend their honor. They are 
as vulnerable as you are. Do not pose to al-Asad conditions for 
a withdrawal, as if he did not have a public opinion to think 
about. Let them take the initiative and display flexibility. 
You should not believe for a minute that only Syria's top 
echelon calls the shots. Syria is much more open today. The 
government takes popular sentiment into account and there is an 
opposition. It is not a totalitarian regime which ignores 
popular sentiment. Countries such as Syria are today educating 
a generation of youngsters about political awareness, and it is 
not easy to change the mentality overnight. 
  Anybody walking down the streets of Syria today can hear 
talk 
against the government. Al-Asad needs time to explain. Also, 
he cannot and does not want to throw all the opponents of the 
process in jail. He would rather persuade them and obtain their 
assistance. Here, I have given you food for thought. 
  [Peri] Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said what he did 
about a future Palestinian state and an uproar ensued in Israel. 
  [Al-Baz] I read about it. It is healthy and good for people 
to express themselves, even if their opinions are outside the 
consensus. You will see, in three years Zvili's words will 
become the consensus. 
  [Peri] In other words, there is no room for illusions. What 
is happening now is leading to a Palestinian state. 
  [Al-Baz] I suppose so. A Palestinian entity which will 
initially be linked to Jordan must be created. If you insist on 
giving them only self-rule, the Palestinian problem will turn 
into a time bomb. I know that you are anguishing over the 
question of whether 'Arafat will be able to run affairs in the 
territories and whether they will have economic independence. 
These are the right questions. 
  [Peri] You want us to help the Palestinians raise funds. 
What about abolishing the Arab boycott against Israel? 
  [Al-Baz] It is plain to me that the Arab boycott will 
disappear as soon as peace agreements are signed with Syria, 
Jordan, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. I estimate that by this 
coming fall, or within a year at most, we will have agreements. 
In my opinion, this is the last year of the Arab boycott. 
There will no longer be a reason for its existence. 
  [Peri] What do you think Saddam Husayn wants? Some swear 
he wants to join the peace process, while others claim he will 
yet give us a bad surprise. 
  [Al-Baz] To tell you the truth, I do not know. I have no 
idea what he wants. 
  [Peri] With your experienced and sober eyes, how do you see 
the Middle East in another five years? 
  [Al-Baz] More stable and safer, with more traffic across the 
borders. Even if old fears and suspicions do not disappear, 
Israel will no longer be an anomaly, but a recognized neighbor. 
I am not sure it will be the green Middle East of Peres' 
scenario, but there will be contacts, economic relations, and 
tourism. Israelis will be free to move in the Arab world. 
  [Peri] Will there be economic cooperation between Syria and 
Israel? 
  [Al-Baz] I am sure about it, just as I am sure that I am 
speaking to you now. 
  [Peri] I must end with two personal questions. You have 
been involved in the peace process for 17 years and you have 
made a significant contribution. At the beginning, however, I 
believe you were very reluctant. In his book, Isma'il Fahmi 
wrote that when al-Sadat informed a small group of people in 
Cairo about his intention to visit Jerusalem you shouted: "The 
president has gone mad, he should be tied up." 
  [Al-Baz] That is not true. I thought al-Sadat was serious, 
but that we should not act on the spur of the moment and that 
the matter should be given a second thought. I do not want to 
brag about what I did in the process. I did my share. I had a 
job. I contributed to the process. 
  It is true that I was initially skeptical. I wondered 
whether Israel would respond. I knew we would have to deal with 
the Likud government. Today I am definitely pleased. There is 
no room for an analogy between the past and the situation today. 
Many of our suspicions and the image we had about you turned 
out to be totally unfounded. Had it not been for the peace with 
Egypt, we would not be where we are today. 
  [Peri] When the time comes and you make a personal visit to 
Israel, what would you like to do? 
  [Al-Baz] As in Egypt, I prefer informal and casual meetings. 
I know your politicians, and I would go on such a trip to talk 
to your intellectuals -- writers, painters, academics -- and to 
the young generation of politicians. I have no desire to go 
touring the country. I do no longer have the curiosity to see 
new places. I prefer the company of people.

  [Text] His Eminence Mufti of the Republic Dr. Muhammad 
Sayyid Tantawi has called on Palestinians to kill an equal 
number of Israelis. Asked by an AL-'ARABI correspondent if an 
earlier statement he made, expressing readiness for dialogue 
with the Israelis, remains valid after the massacre in the 
Ibrahimi mosque, the mufti asked: "What is the use of canceling 
dialogue between the Arabs and Israelis?" 
  The AL-'ARABI correspondent said the mufti's office 
represents a symbol for Muslims in Egypt and is therefore in a 
delicate position; it must not get embroiled in efforts aimed at 
normalization with the enemy, something that several 
professional associations and popular organizations still 
oppose. The mufti commented, saying: "Don't get emotional. We 
are averse to dialogue with no one, as long as it can help to 
solve problems and conflicts."

Israeli ambassador in Cairo has received threats that he will be 
killed if he does not hasten to leave Cairo. The sources added 
that all Israeli Embassy diplomats have received similar 
recurrent threats over the past few days in protest against the 
Israeli massacre, which killed and wounded a large number of 
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  The AL-RA'Y correspondent has learned that the Egyptian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected a request by Israeli

<F P=106> [Interview with al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali </F>
Jad-al-Haqq by an unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [AL-WAFD] What is the al-Azhar stance on events in 
Egypt now? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq] Your question appears to 
concern media reports on clashes between some groups and the 
police under the name of (terrorism and combating terrorism). I 
would like to say first and very clearly: Events in Egypt 
cannot be called terrorism. Most of the incidents and attacks 
by groups on policemen are reaction. The incidents are either 
criminal ones that violate the law or acts of revenge. Revenge 
is well known in Upper Egypt. It is wrong to say that these 
incidents and their causes are terrorism. "I believe that this 
is very clear." 
  [AL-WAFD] But aren't they attributed to religion? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] That is something else. If a thief steals and 
says (in the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful), what 
do we do with him? There is nothing we can do. But it is wrong 
to call this Islam or the Islamic groups and not say what it 
really is: This is a thief and this is a killer. Every incident 
must be identified for what it really is. Not everything need 
be attributed to an Islamic group, because Islam is innocent of 
these actions. Islam gives no one the right to exact punishment 
himself. It permits no one to steal, kill, or scare people. 
How can we affiliate those who do such things with Islam and 
say that these are Islamic groups? This is wrong. 
  [AL-WAFD] But you might agree with me that there are 
particular ideas of which some people are convinced. Are their 
actions based on these ideas? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] This might be the case but the al-Azhar has 
called on these people to go to the clerics when they are in 
doubt about something. If these people do not go to the clerics 
and raise their ideas with them, how can we identify them? 
  Let them be described by the crimes they have committed when 
they are tried. Their ideas will then become known and the 
clerics can debate them. 
  [Al-WAFD] Your Eminence, remember how the military court 
that 
tried the killers of [former Awqaf minister] Shaykh al-Dhahabi 
in 1977 said the al-Azhar and its clerics failed to play their 
role and added that their absence from the arena was a reason 
for the religious vacuum. It saw the al-Azhar as responsible 
for the appearance and spread of terrorism. As in the past, the 
same words are reiterated very often these days, are they not? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] Without criticizing the ruling to which you 
referred, that was a judicial point of view. It wasn't fair in 
terms of the reality. Those who take their information from the 
media are slack in their duties. The media does not cover the 
al-Azhar and does not report the steps taken by it or the things 
it is doing. Preachers are all over the country, institutes' 
clerics are in all the villages and throughout the whole 
country, and everyone is performing his propagation duty. Where 
is the slackness? 
  Al-Azhar's task is to give advice, not to carry weapons or 
chase the outlaws. This is the task of other quarters. If the 
al-Azhar's effort is not known to those who take their 
information from the media, then it is they who have fallen 
short in their knowledge. Al-Azhar has never been absent from 
the arena and it isn't now. 
  [AL-WAFD] Does this mean that you don't agree there is a 
religious vacuum? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] The religious vacuum is in education, not in 
life in general. The clerics are doing their job everywhere. 
The real vacuum is in education, from the nursery school to the 
university. 
  [AL-WAFD] Criticism addressed to al-Azhar in the past few 
years did not come from outside al-Azhar alone, but from its own 
scholars as well. 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] Every man has his own way; not everyone 
upholds 
the same views. The clerics who accuse al-Azhar of slackness 
should ask themselves what they are offering. 
  [AL-WAFD] We cannot overlook that the major extremist 
organization is led by an al-Azhar scholar, Shaykh 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman. 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] God knows that al-Azhar is doing its duty, 
from 
the oldest shaykhs to the youngest student. But every man has 
his own beliefs and his approach to performing his duties. With 
all due respect for his person, Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman has 
his own beliefs and his approach, which is not approved by Islam. 
  [AL-WAFD] What is your view of that approach? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] I have nothing to add to what I have already 
said. You said that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman criticizes al-Azhar 
although he is an al-Azhar graduate. I said satan disobeyed the 
orders of the lord. 
  [AL-WAFD] In 1977, al-Azhar Grand Imam 'Abd-al-Halim Mahmud 
had to issue a statement, which was not published at the time, 
defending al-Azhar over accusations leveled by the state and 
Islamic groups. Do you think you need such a statement? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] No, we do not need it, because we promote the 
call and defend nobody. We advise all the people. Al-Azhar 
statements were issued at the right time. As I said, everyone 
has his way. 
  [AL-WAFD] But the state and society are demanding that you 
play some role in fighting the growing Islamic violence. Do you 
think you have a role to play? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] The role of al-Azhar or propagation is to give 
advice. If the target population fails to respond, al-Azhar 
does not have the physical power to impose order. This is the 
job of the other apparatuses. 
  [AL-WAFD] You have not been involved in the mediation 
attempts that some people are trying to undertake. Why? 
  [Jad-al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not involve itself in everything 
that comes to people's minds. It is always useful to give the 
opportunity to other institutions that are involved in 
propagating Islam, such as the licensed associations. There is 
no harm if people intervene in this issue or if they offer to 
mediate in it. I have no information on the details. They 
offered mediation more than once and I don't know what has been 
done about it. 
  [AL-WAFD] Do you think al-Azhar can play a role in patching 
up discord or in curbing the extent of the violence? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] We can only rectify the discord if we know 
about it. Al-Azhar knows only one party to the conflict, 
namely, the government. But if the other party becomes known, 
then al-Azhar could intercede. We don't know them personally 
and we don't know their principles. This is because we read 
about them in the press only when events occur. 
  [AL-WAFD] But haven't you received their writings (books and 
leaflets)? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] Yes. We receive some of their ideas and books. 
We study them in a scientific way. But the names of their 
authors do not appear in the books. The books have no titles or 
addresses. They are merely books seized by the police. Then we 
are asked if the books contain sound ideas. We respond 
accordingly. 
  [AL-WAFD] Don't you believe that the discussion of these 
ideas in the media would produce good results? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] It would have been better for the media to 
keep 
away from the rumors and exaggeration of events. But the media, 
be they in Egypt or abroad, have failed to do so. Perhaps the 
media in Egypt have, regrettably, been affected by reports 
coming from abroad. 
  [AL-WAFD] In the early eighties, you were one of those who 
supervised dialogue with the youths who are described as 
extremists. Now, after 10 years, do you believe the dialogue 
represents the ideal method? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] Doubtless, prophets were not sent to the 
people 
by means of guns, but by the word, which calls for righteousness 
and peace, as well as by the call for dialogue. The Koran is 
full of dialogue between the prophets and their peoples and 
between Prophet Muhammad, God bless him and grant him salvation, 
and his people. The dialogue must come first. 
  [AL-WAFD] Some people blame you, saying that instead of 
focusing on confronting the extremists, you are fighting others 
by confiscating their books. 
  [Jad al-Haqq] Al-Azhar does not confiscate books or ideas. 
It only prohibits those attacking religion. 
  [AL-WAFD] Does al-Azhar have its chance to reply in the 
various media? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] No. Al-Azhar has a limited framework that is 
not part of censorship. Al-Azhar authorizes the printing of the 
Koran and the prophet's sayings only. These can only be printed 
with the permission of al-Azhar. Al-Azhar revises the text of 
the prophet's sayings and authorizes the printing. Apart from 
that, al-Azhar does not interfere. Al-Azhar only examines that 
which comes from individuals, groups, or the state. Al-Azhar 
gives its opinion as an expert, not as a censor. 
  [AL-WAFD] Many writings and official opinions in the West, 
particularly in the United States, started referring to the 
Muslim world as the new enemy and the substitute for Communism. 
What is your comment? 
  [Jad al-Haqq] This is obvious. They mean what they say. 
This is evident in the United States and Europe's campaign 
against the Muslims and their issues. But particular spots in 
the Muslim world have enough problems, which prevent them from 
carrying out their humanitarian duties and developing and 
promoting their financial and economic resources. Thorns are 
being planted in the Muslim world.

<F P=106> [All Iranian names as published] </F>
  [Editorial Report] London AL-WASAT in Arabic in its 21-27 
February issue publishes on pages 17-19 an approximately 
2,500-word report by Hasan 'Awwad on the current "power 
struggle" in Iran. 
  The report says that Iranian President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani "received a painful blow a few days ago" when 
Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic revolution, 
dismissed the president's brother Mohammad Rafsanjani, chief of 
the Iranian Radio and Television establishment. The report adds 
that this decision, which took the president and his brother by 
surprise, was welcomed by hardliners inside and outside the 
establishment. The report says: "The Iranian institution 
considered Khamene'i's decision and its timing -- one day after 
the revolution anniversary celebrations which ended on Friday 
[11 February] -- a painful blow to Mohammad Rafsanjani and the 
president, who tried to benefit from the assassination attempt 
which took place at the beginning of the celebrations at the 
Khomeyni tomb. The president wanted to strengthen his 
popularity and influence, which began to decrease around the 
time of the presidential elections last summer." 
  The report then reviews the assignment of Mohammad 
Rafsanjani 
as the chief of the Iranian radio and television establishment, 
his dealing with establishment officials, the "deviation" that 
prevailed in the establishment, and the conflict he waged with 
Murtada Awini, former official in charge of the Islamic Art and 
Culture Center. 
  The report says that Khamene'i wanted to dismiss Mohammad 
Rafsanjani before this date, however, he sought to maintain 
internal balances. However, the report adds, Khamene'i 
instructed a parliamentary committee to prepare a report on the 
radio and television, its negative points, and deviations. This 
prompted Mohammad Rafsanjani to commit deadly mistakes, which 
resulted in his dismissal. The report cites "sources" as saying 
that Khamene'i wants to prevent the establishment of any 
dictatorship in the country and to institutionalize Iran. The 
sources added that when the parliamentary committee issued its 
report on the radio and television, Mohammad Rafsanjani reacted 
emotionally and leveled "severe accusations" against the members 
of the committee. The supporters of the committee staged 
demonstrations in Asfahan and called for the officials in charge 
of the radio and television to be punished. What exacerbated 
the situation, according to the report, is that Mohammad 
Rafsanjani banned live coverage of the parliament's discussions 
and the speeches of its members. Consequently, the parliament 
supported Khamene'i and called on him to send more inspection 
committees to institutions under the president's control, with 
the exception of the Armed Forces, which are under the 
supervision of Khamene'i himself. 
  The report says that the first thing 'Ali Larijani, new 
director of the radio and television establishment, must do is 
to sack the official in charge of foreign radios because he was 
criticized, more than any other official, by the parliamentary 
committee. 
  The recent change in the administration of the radio and 
television establishment prompted President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
to appoint Mostafa Mir Salim as minister of culture and Islamic 
guidance. In addition, other changes were made and will be made 
at the instructions of Khamene'i to cope with the era of 
economic and social reform.

  [Text] The interior minister has announced: The Islamic 
Republic of Iran and Turkey have no border disputes and complete 
security prevails on the two countries' common borders. 
  Mr. Besharati announced this news in an interview with our 
correspondent. He added: The good relations between Iran and 
Turkey have resulted in the two countries witnessing complete 
security on their common borders. He stressed that no country 
can bring about security on its borders by itself. He added: 
We currently have no problems on our eastern borders either. 
  Referring to the exceptional situation in northern, central 
and southern Iraq, Besharati stressed: The situation in various 
parts of Iraq has brought about special conditions on Iranian 
borders. Thanks to the alertness of border-dwellers, 
particularly the self-sacrificing people of Kordestan, the 
security situation in that area, among our country's border 
regions, is becoming more favorable. 
  Referring to the presence of 2.5 to 3 million Afghan 
refugees, and also other refugees, in Iran, the interior 
minister said: So long as the countries of origin of the 
refugees are not calm their presence in Iran is feasible.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamid Haydar from Tehran] </F>
  [Text] The talks held by Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid al-Faysal in Tehran have not 
yielded the results Iraq sought to achieve; namely, breaking its 
regional and international isolation. 
  Knowledgeable sources in Tehran have asserted to AL-WASAT 
that the Iraqi official was surprised by Iran's hard-line 
approach toward attempts at normalization between Tehran and 
Baghdad, unlike the previous rounds of talks held late last year 
in Karachi, New York, and Baghdad. 
  The sources said Iran rejected a proposal by al-Faysal to 
resume trade trips along the joint border "because Iran does not 
want to violate the international trade embargo" against Iraq. 
  The sources added that "trade borders, which had been open 
on 
humanitarian grounds and within the framework of the 
international resolutions regarding the economic embargo, were 
shut off completely by a direct decision issued by Ayatollah 
'Ali Khamene'i, the spiritual guide of the revolution." 
Khamene'i stressed that the border shall remain closed to trade 
until further notice in the wake of the killing of several 
Iranian border guards during trade operations last year. 
  The sources said Khamene'i made this decision after 
receiving 
information and warnings that the U.S. Administration is about 
to take "tangible" measures against Iran on charges of violating 
the international economic embargo against Iraq. 
  The sources further said that the Iraqi official suggested 
"sacrificing" the leaders of the opposition organization of 
Mojahedin-e Khalq if Iran agrees to resume trade operations. 
Iranian officials, who were interested several months ago in 
bringing the leaders of Mojahedin-e Khalq under control, 
rejected the tempting Iraqi offer because they believe the U.S. 
Administration is looking for "excuses to harass Iran".

<F P=106> [Report on remarks by Dr. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian </F>
deputy foreign minister in charge of international affairs; 
place and date not given; from the "World of Politics" 
program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Unidentified announcer] [passage omitted] A 
group of our listeners have asked us to provide some information 
about the present nature of our country's relations with Iraq, 
the exchange of Iraqi and Iranian delegations, and finally the 
POW issue. 
  We invite all these dear listeners to pay attention to 
remarks made over the telephone by Dr. Mohammad Javad Zarif, 
deputy foreign minister in charge of international affairs. 
  [Mohammead Javad Zarif] In the name of God, the merciful, 
the 
compassionate. The Islamic Republic -- on the basis of its 
general policy of seeking relations based on peaceful 
coexistence with all its neighbors -- has been trying to 
normalize its ties with Iraq. A number of meetings were held in 
Karachi and New York between the foreign affairs ministers of 
Iran and Iraq during the course of last year. During these 
meetings, the two sides decided that delegations should be 
exchanged between the two countries at the ministerial level, so 
that bilateral ties may improve and develop by resolving the 
problems that exist on the path of relations between the two 
countries. 
  In order to prepare the ground for the first visit by a 
minister -- that is to say, the visit by His Excellency Dr. 
Velayati -- to Baghdad, and in order to lay down the agenda of 
work for the ministers, it has been decided that an Islamic 
Republic delegation should visit Baghdad and an Iraqi delegation 
should reciprocate the visit. It is hoped that the visits may 
pave the way for the resolution of the two countries' 
outstanding problems, as far as possible. [passage omitted] 
  The basis of our approach to Iraq is our emphasis on that 
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and on peaceful 
coexistence on the basis of the 1975 accord and UN Security 
Council Resolution 598. In order to attain these goals, the 
remaining problems that surround relations between the two 
countries should be essentially resolved. In particular, the 
POW issue, with its humanitarian dimensions, should be dealt 
with as a first step toward reaching an all-embracing solution. 
  The Islamic Republic has always been ready to cooperate 
fully 
to resolve this humanitarian issue. However, right from the 
outset and during the course of the imposed war -- as well as 
after the cease-fire and even after the release of the first 
batch of POWs -- the Iraqi Government has unfortunately been 
pursuing a secretive policy in this area. In order to improve 
bilateral ties, this policy needs to be reviewed. This was an 
issue that the Iraqi delegation was reminded of in a serious 
tone during my visit to Iraq and also during the course of the 
recent visit to Tehran by the Iraqi delegation. 
  They were reminded that they needed to review their policy 
and clarify the situation surrounding the Iranian POWs still 
remaining in Iraq. This implies that the remaining POWs who 
intend to return to Iran should be repatriated. In this case, 
an important obstacle that stands in the way of relations 
between the two countries may be removed. We hope the Iraqi 
Government will make the appropriate decision in dealing with 
this issue. 
  Discussions were also held on other issues, such as frontier 
problems and the other outstanding issues. It was decided that 
delegations of experts and specialists should be exchanged 
between the two countries during the period of time between the 
return of the Iraqi delegation to their country and the visit by 
Dr. Velayati to Iraq in the second half of Ordibehesht 1373 
[5-21 May 1994]. These delegations will study the details of the 
outstanding issues, so that, God willing, a sufficiently high 
degree of understanding will have been reached to enable the 
ministers to implement decisions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Jordanian Ambassador to Iran </F>
Yasin Istanbuli by an unidentified KEYHAN correspondent in 
Tehran; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [KEYHAN] In view of the numerous vicissitudes in 
Iran-Jordan relations, what is your opinion of the trend in 
bilateral relations? 
  [Istanbuli] When we discuss relations between Iran and 
Jordan, we imply long, historic, and continuing bilateral 
relations. 
  Two years ago, it was decided that relations should be 
improved. There are various issues and circumstances 
necessitating better and broader relations. The issue of 
normalizing, establishing, and continuing relations with Iran is 
an important one, which is being seriously pursued in Jordan in 
word and deed. Recently, King Husayn told a news conference 
that Iran has no role in fomenting tension in Arab countries and 
this indicates Jordan's stance on the importance of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Prince Hasan also stresses the role and 
importance of Iran in the Middle East. 
  In letters to Iranian officials, King Husayn has stressed 
Jordan's wish for better and improved relations with Iran. The 
visits by various political, economic, and cultural delegations 
to the Islamic Republic of Iran indicate Jordan's desire to 
broaden ties with Iran. [passage omitted] 
  [KEYHAN] To what do you attribute the problems that cropped 
up in Iranian-Jordanian relations? 
  [Istanbuli] The current relations between Iran and Jordan 
are 
based on the two countries and peoples being Muslim, having a 
fundamental role in the Islamic world, and being part of the 
great Islamic ummah. You should not ignore the role of the mass 
media. The West has adopted two policies with regard to the 
Islamic world: One concerns principled leanings 
[osul-gera'i--euphemism for fundamentalism] and the dangers and 
the second is the issue of human rights regarding which the 
Western countries have concentrated their propaganda on 
particular Islamic countries. In this manner, they claim that 
these countries do not adhere to democratic principles and 
violate human rights. They cover up human rights violations in 
other countries. The victims in both cases are Muslims. 
  The mass media in Islamic countries should defend the 
Islamic 
culture and civilization more than ever so that they can combat 
the Western media's propaganda. You should strive to eliminate 
obstacles and replace them with common denominators and muster 
every resource against such onslaughts. This should be a common 
strategy for all Muslim countries. 
  On the effective role played by the mass media in raising 
the 
level of bilateral relations, he said: Much material is 
published in Jordanian newspapers regarding the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. A few weeks ago, the Iranian ambassador in Jordan was 
interviewed in the press. Similarly, articles and reports on 
elections and other important issues in Iran are published in 
Jordanian newspapers, all of which are geared toward broadening 
bilateral relations. 
  The Jordanian ambassador then referred to the publication of 
articles in Iranian newspapers that tend to project Jordan's 
stance as servile to the United States, opposed to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and anti-Islamic and added: This is not true. 
Jordan wants to have cordial relations with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  Referring to the past record of historic, cultural, and 
Islamic relations between Iran and Jordan, the ambassador called 
for greater contacts between the two countries and the two 
nations and said that despite the problems, bilateral relations 
are on a favorable level. He added: We are living in a region 
in which we should bring our stances and ideas closer together 
and eschew discord. 
  [KEYHAN] The Islamic al-Tahrir party was formed many years 
ago in Jordan but why has it never participated in the political 
process with other factions and adopted the path of opposition? 
  [Istanbuli] This is linked with the thinking and leanings 
of the party. You can ask them this question. The newspaper 
AL-LULWA recently published the party's manifesto, its stance, 
and its strategies, to which you can refer. There is no law in 
Jordan that bans any party on the basis of its thinking. Every 
party is free to state its beliefs and the law on parties 
clarifies that the Islamic al-Tahrir party can carry out its 
activities on the basis of the Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho Accord as 
a 
peace agreement? 
  [Istanbuli] Naturally, if the objective of the Palestinian 
leadership is to create a Palestinian government by means of 
this accord, we cannot say that the Palestinians are wrong. If 
it does not culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian 
government, we can say that they should not do such things. 
  [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of Jordan's West Bank? Will 
you set up a confederation to administer these Palestinian 
territories? 
  [Istanbuli] The West Bank is part of Jordan and this has 
been 
clarified in the Constitution. If the Palestinian leadership 
talks of a confederation, we believe that we are one nation, 
that Jordan is one big nation. We don't even mention the 
Syrians or Lebanese, with whom we have very deep relations, 
which surpass all talk of a confederation. 
  [KEYHAN] How do you view the future of the Middle East, 
especially after the Gaza-Jericho Accord? 
  [Istanbuli] The interests of the Arab and Islamic countries 
are the main basis, the principles that should be incorporated 
in such accords. And there should be provision for the 
conditions of unity of Islamic countries. Jordan stresses the 
need for an Islamic common market that should include every Arab 
and Islamic country. 
  Jordanian Prime Minister Amir Hasan also stressed the role 
of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran in an Islamic common market. These 
are the countries that should resist the enemies' economic and 
cultural onslaughts. We are the first country to stress these 
Islamic-Arab slogans. [passage omitted] 
  [KEYHAN] How do you view Jordan's relations with the Persian 
Gulf countries with regard to the oil war, now that some years 
have passed since then? 
  [Istanbuli] Jordan has always attached much importance to 
its 
relations with the Persian Gulf countries and it does not 
benefit Jordan on principle to adopt a stance against these 
countries. Jordan's policy was to amicably settle the issue of 
the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. In this regard, Jordan 
concurs with the Islamic Republic of Iran and believes that 
foreign forces should not be present in the region. We do not 
want to be opposed to an Arab country and we have cordial 
relations with the Persian Gulf countries. 
  [KEYHAN] In view of the current international conditions and 
the changes in the international structure, how do you view the 
future world order and Jordan's place therein? 
  [Istanbuli] You know that Jordan is a small country in terms 
of its area but has the longest border with Israel. Therefore, 
it has the greatest responsibility of all the Arab and Islamic 
countries. The issue is that Jordan has always tried to have a 
strong army in terms of its resources and capability. It is 
Jordan's strategy to be a country strong in its unity and 
solidarity with its friends. 
  Jordan does not favor differences between Arab and Islamic 
countries, as differences in the Arab and Islamic world will be 
detrimental and harmful. You can see this in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iraq, and Libya and the Islamic and Arab 
world are cooperating on this. We see that two Arab and Islamic 
countries are under an economic embargo. As an Arab and a 
Muslim, I believe there are children, women, and aged people who 
are affected by it and we have a duty to them as Muslims. As 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is the same. In Somalia and 
Afghanistan, the real victims are Muslims again and this 
indicates foreign intervention and losses to Muslims. 
  The potential resources of Islamic countries are a strong 
cultural force against Western civilization, indicating a strong 
and basic international culture. Jordan's strategy right from 
the outset has been that this culture and civilization should 
remain strong and firmly in place and that that requires the 
cooperation of Arab and Islamic countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'eri: "Iranian Opposition Party Accuses </F>
Authorities of Arresting One of Its Prominent Members"] 
  [Text] Paris -- The opposition Iranian National Party has 
announced that the day before yesterday security forces arrested 
one of its prominent members, namely Dr. Siyavosh Sayhat, in 
Esfahan in central Iran. The party said that his family does 
not know where he is being held. 
  A statement issued by the party said that Sayhat, an Esfahan 
University professor, is a well-known doctor who "saved the 
lives of thousands of Iranian soldiers under enemy fire" during 
the Iraq-Iran war (1980-1988). The party urged "all Iranians 
inside and outside the country to raise their voice against 
repressive actions...and to demand the immediate release of this 
courageous son of Iran." 
  It is known that the National Party, led by Daryush Furuhar 
(64), is one of the oldest secular political parties in Iran. 
It opposed the former regime and is now opposed to the current 
Islamic regime. In a recent statement Furuhar urged clerics to 
"quietly hand over power" to national forces. 
  A prominent female member of the party named Homa Darabi 
(51), who was a physician and professor at Tehran University, 
committed suicide on 21 February in protest at the conditions of 
Iranian women. Hundreds of people took part in her funeral 
ceremonies at a well-known mosque in Tehran.

  [Text] Tehran, Feb. 28, IRNA -- Managing Director of the 
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) and Chairman of the 
Non-aligned News Agencies Pool (NANAP), Fereydun Verdinezhad on 
Monday sent messages to chiefs of NANAP member news agencies, on 
last Friday's massacre of Palestinian worshippers in al-Khalil 
mosque, and urged them to reveal the nature of the latest 
Israeli crime to the world. 
  He regretted that although crimes of racist nature such as 
those in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the lates one in occupied 
Palestine, have increased of late, "the horrifying aspects of 
the crimes are treated lightly by world news agencies." 
  Verdinejad expressed hope that nanap members, bearing in 
mind 
the principle of free-thinking of the non-aligned movement and 
their own professional responsibilities would do their best to 
convey the message of the long-suffering people to the world and 
expose the criminals. 
  The message emphasized that the murder and the massacre of 
civilians by the military, in the name of human rights and 
freedom, should be stopped as soon as possible. 
  More than 60 fasting Muslims were gunned down in cold blood 
at the Prophet Ibrahim mosque in al-Khalil by Zionist agents 
last Friday.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, March 3, IRNA -- Iranian 
Ambassador to the United Nations Gholam 'Ali Khoshru here 
Wednesday called on the Security Council to urge for liberation 
of occupied Palestine, as the only and genuine way to bring 
about justice, and for the dismantling of all Zionist 
settlements and return of all Palestinian refugees to their 
homeland. 
  Addressing the session, Khoshru said that the last Friday 
massacre of Palestinian worshipers in al-Khalil by the Zionists 
would not be the last if the approach of the international 
community towards the question of Palestine continues to be the 
same. 
  He further noted that the circumstances surrounding the 
tragic incident clearly proved the fact that the attack was 
premeditated and led by the elements from Zionist army. 
  "That the Israeli soldiers guarding the mosque not only did 
nothing to stop the massacre but as the Zionists confessed 
later, opened fire on the worshipers who were fleeing the scene, 
clearly indicates that the full responsibility over the massacre 
lies with the Zionist regime," he added. 
  The ambassador also remarked that it was astonishing, while 
Zionists coming from a land thousands miles away were allowed to 
carry automatic guns, attack indigenous civilians in their 
mosque, but Palestinians were not allowed to live in their 
homeland and were subjected to continuous Zionist brutality. 
  Khoshru voiced solidarity of both the Iranian people and 
government with the Palestinians and support for their struggles 
and expressed their deepest condolences to the bereaved families 
and Palestinian people on the occasion of the horrible massacre.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Five days after the bloody tragedy of Ibrahim 
mosque in Hebron, during which more than 600 innocent 
Palestinians were either killed or wounded, the PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat at last decided to call off talks with the Zionist 
regime for the time being. Shortly after this bloody tragedy, 
U.S. President Clinton invited 'Arafat to Washington to hold 
talks with the Zionist regime led by Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin on ways of solving implementation problems of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord. 'Arafat hastily accepted this invitation. 
However, the united and angry response of the Palestine people 
in the face of the Zionist regime's horrific crime and its 
repercussions in the entire Arab and Islamic world pushed 
'Arafat into a corner and he excused himself. [passage omitted] 
  It is quite natural that under the existing explosive 
situation in Palestinian society no one dares hold talks with 
the Zionist regime under the name of the Palestinian people. 
'Arafat's decision to call off the talks at this stage is in 
fact a message to those responsible for the massacre of the 
innocent people that they should not worry as the talks will 
resume as soon as the circumstances change and the Palestinians 
calm down. Whereas the Palestinians in the occupied territories 
and the people of neighboring countries including Egypt, Jordan, 
and Lebanon have staged rallies and protest marches to demand 
the ultimate cancellation of the talks. No doubt the adoption 
of a conciliatory approach on the talks with the Zionist regime 
-- at a time when there are clear signs that the Zionist regime 
was directly involved in the massacre of the worshippers in the 
Ibrahim mosque -- is a step to win the support of the Zionist 
regime and the White House statesmen. Such an approach 
definitely seeks to serve the interests of the Zionist regime 
and the White House. The Palestinians demand something 
different and have announced this demand explicitly.

  [Text] Tehran, March 2 (AFP)--An Iranian radical daily on 
Wednesday blasted the "disgusting" offer by Saudi King Fahd to 
pay 53,000 dollars to the families of every Palestinian killed 
during and after the Hebron massacre. 
  "What is the motive of the Saudis in taking the lead and 
offering compensation on behalf of Israel?" JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, 
close to the Islamic hardliners, asked. 
  "Has Riyadh volunteered in such a disgusting act under 
pressure from Israel and the United States, or because it feels 
responsibility for the tragedy?" 
  The paper warned that the offer could "risk tempting the 
Zionists to repeat such crime" and portray an image of Saudi 
Arabia as a defender of Israel. 
  A Saudi spokesman said Monday that the king had decided to 
make the gesture "to ease the suffering of relatives of those 
martyred in the vile massacre ... [ellipsis as received] and 
those shot dead afterwards by the Israeli army." 
  The money would be paid to relatives of those who died in 
the 
mosque massacre and demonstrators who were shot and killed later 
the same day. 
  The king also offered to fly the seriously wounded 
Palestinians to Saudi hospitals. 
  Iran has strongly condemned the slaughter and several 
demonstrations have been held in protest at the incident in 
Iranian cities. 
  The Israeli army says 30 Palestinians died in the mosque, 
and 
Palestinian doctors said the toll was 52.

  [Text] Tehran, March 2, IRNA -- Deputy Foreign Minister for 
Euro-American Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi said here Wednesday that the 
only way to resolve the Karabakh crisis is for representatives 
of Azerbaijan and Armenia to sit at the negotiating table. 
  He said Iran as the great neighbour of the two republics is 
concerned about problems of the region and feels its 
responsibility to help settle the crisis. 
  Tehran puts emphasis against escalation of the almost 
six-year-old conflict and calls for peaceful steps to put an end 
to the fighting, he said. 
  "The Islamic Republic of Iran denounces occupation of 
Azerbaijani territory," said Va'ezi, adding "we believe the 
Armenians should withdraw from all occupied areas and obstacles 
should be removed through political talks." He said Iran held 
consultations with Russian officials to hold a quadruple meeting 
involving Tehran, Moscow, Baku and Yerevan, to help end the 
crisis. 
  Asked about his talks with his Armenian counterpart, 
Lypartian who visited Tehran earlier this week, Va'ezi said that 
issues related to the region and Karabakh and ways to end the 
crisis as well as issues of mutual interests were the topics of 
the talks. 
  "We informed the Armenian side about the problems possible 
escalation of the fighting could pose for Iranian interests," he 
added. He said that he believes the Armenian side has 
seriously taken into account Tehran's position.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Tightening of the Screw on Pyongyang"] </F>
  [Text] With the collapse of the former Soviet empire, and 
the ongoing economic/political liberalization or modernization 
of China, the continued existence of North Korea seems to be a 
question mark more than ever before. 
  The two countries--the former Soviet Union and China--used 
to 
be of great importance to North Korea if not for providing it 
with economic assistance, then for the moral support they 
afforded it. These two countries gave North Korea the feeling 
that it was part of a greater cause, or a greater game, namely 
the now extinct game of communism. 
  What brings the long-term or continued existence of the 
North 
Korean regime specially under question is the fact that it is 
surrounded on all sides by a number of countries with dynamic 
economies by world standards; countries which are continuing to 
experience growth despite the debilitating and lingering world 
economic recession. Even Vietnam with its former moribund 
economy is registering great economic improvements and 
attracting foreign investments. 
  Therefore, if the realities in East Asia are any indication, 
the North Korean regime won't exist for long in its present 
political isolationist form. But the change or changes in the 
North Korean regime will not come, no matter how much the 
pressure from without or within, as long as its present 
leadership is alive. President Kim Il-song is a well 
established political institution in that country. He is, and 
will always be, the liberator of the "fatherland" from Japanese 
and American colonialisms. 
  This latter qualification, the fact of being a political 
institution and a liberator also applies to President Fidel 
Castro of Cuba. The two are leaders with unshaking unwavering 
popular support behind them which no amount of foreign 
propaganda can weaken. The past heroic struggles of these two 
leaders for the "liberation" of their countries are reasons 
enough for their continued rule, just as long as they live. 
  As far as North Korea's other half, i.e. South Korea, is 
concerned, there have been tension and sporadic friction between 
the two, but everything considered they have managed to bear one 
another and coexist for some half a century. 
  But now, all of a sudden, it has been about a year maybe, 
that the question of North Korea's nuclear arms possession has 
become a hot, menacing and destabilizing issue. Despite being a 
topic of frontpage controversy and accusations, Washington has 
not given any concrete proof on what it claims and the whole 
thing seems to have been based on conjecture. 
  The whole crisis surrounding the possession of nuclear arms 
by North Korea looks like a continued and artificial one. And 
there can be a number of reasons why the Americans are raising 
tension in the Korean Peninsula, and for that matter in East 
Asia, and in the meantime worrying everyone. Japan seems to 
have taken the whole deal seriously and is deeply concerned. 
  Washington is subjecting the North Korean regime to so much 
pressure, it is good Pyongyang has not gone berserk. And if it 
goes berserk it should not surprise anyone. The idea of 
regarding the application of sanctions by the Americans and 
their allies as a "declaration of war" might be an indication of 
that. 
  Washington is putting pressure in North Korea to open up its 
nuclear sites to inspection to make sure Pyongyang is no threat 
at all and that it is one hundred percent helpless. But to the 
North Korean regime, the idea of possessing nuclear arms is 
tantamount to prestige and a means of having its existence 
recognized. 
  Therefore, no matter how much the threat of force and 
application of economic sanctions, North Korea will not open up 
its nuclear sites to inspection. For what is North Korea in the 
absence of even the perceived possession of nuclear arms?

  [Text] While it has been more than two months since the 
successful conclusion of the eighth round of international trade 
talks known as the "Uruguay Round" in the framework of the GATT 
organization, the question of whether the Islamic Republic of 
Iran should or should not join this organization is still one of 
the hottest topics of debate in Tehran's economic circles. 
  The public relations office of the Ministry of Commerce 
reports that based on a joint proposal from the Ministry of 
Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a committee will 
soon be formed to study the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
membership in GATT. This committee's duties include a careful 
study of the pros and cons of GATT membership and its likely 
consequences, appropriate recommendations, proposals and 
policies to reduce the negative consequences of membership or 
nonmembership, identifying the political and legal obstacles and 
problems with membership or nonmembership in GATT and 
coordinating the utilization of GATT's technical and specialist 
resources. 
  Some of Tehran's newspapers have recently vigorously opposed 
Iran's membership in GATT, and have seen it as a factor in the 
destruction of the nation's production units. In a series of 
harshly critical articles under the title "Consequences of the 
GATT Agreement for Developing Nations," the newspaper RESALAT 
questioned this organization's goals and wrote: "It appears that 
ultimately GATT has targeted the economic independence of the 
developing nations. If these nations submit to the GATT 
agreement, it will damage their economic independence, which is 
the foundation of their political independence and sovereignty, 
and the developing nations will become second-class members of 
the global village." 
  On the other hand the Institute for Trade Studies and 
Research recently published a book called Understanding 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and a Study of 
the Consequences of the Islamic Republic of Iran Becoming a 
Member. Esfandiar Omidbakhsh and Mas'ud Taromsari, the 
book's authors, write concerning the long-term consequences of 
membership: "Iran's economy is in a state of transition and we 
are in the phase of testing the effects of structural 
adjustments on the nation's overall economy and trade. We are 
still a long way from reaching an established and fully formed 
economic system. Yet membership in GATT is basically a long-term 
cycle and every nation desiring membership in this organization 
must make decisions in this regard in terms of its long-term 
economic and trade objectives. Therefore, the proper procedure 
for studying the issue of GATT membership for a nation such as 
ours, which does not have firm programs and policies--and, of 
course, this is a characteristic of a period of transition--must 
certainly be based on a long-term view." 
  The authors of the aforementioned book add: "An important 
point is the question of what state our economy will be in after 
this period of transition is over. What characteristics will our 
economic structure have? In essence, Iran's foreign trade 
structure in the years following the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, despite controls and deregulation, has more or less 
followed the same pattern that was followed in the country 
during the previous three decades. We have not yet succeeded in 
making proper use of foreign trade as a tool for industrial and 
economic development...therefore with this kind of foreign trade 
structure, in the long term GATT membership will not benefit the 
country that much."

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz has called for 
efforts to be intensified and for objections to be more loudly 
raised in the region and the world against the unjust ones and 
aggressors who covet peoples' rights and threaten their security 
and legitimate interests. He stressed the need for justice and 
peace to prevail among peoples. 
  Receiving a delegation of Eastern Catholic patriarchs, Tariq 
'Aziz reviewed the dimensions of the plot that targets all 
countries of the region and their peoples' security, stability, 
and peace. He said that the unjust blockade, which the arrogant 
powers, especially the United States and Zionism, insist on 
imposing on Iraq, constitutes one of the landmarks of this plot. 
He stressed that the blockade must be lifted since Iraq has 
honored its obligations in accordance with Resolution 687. 
  Bishop Rafael (Bidawid), head of the delegation and the 
Babylon Chaldean patriarchate, stressed the need to put an end 
to the suffering of the patient Iraqi people through serious 
[word indistinct] at all forums to lift the unjust blockade and 
to establish peace and justice in the region.

provocative acts by dropping leaflets, and that the Kuwaiti 
rulers have recently flown drones to drop leaflets on Iraqi 
territory. 
  In a letter delivered to the UN Security Council president 
by 
the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations 
circulated today, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf 
detailed the aggressive and provocative acts carried out by U.S. 
and other warplanes, which violate the Iraqi airspace, flying 
from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. During their flights, 
these planes dropped provocative and hostile leaflets promoting 
instigation against Iraq. 
  The foreign minister added: While condemning these 
aggressive and provocative acts, we hold the Saudi and Kuwaiti 
rulers fully responsible for their participation in acts of 
aggression against Iraq, for the extensive material losses these 
acts cause, and also for the security, economic, political, and 
moral threats they pose to Iraq and the Iraqi people.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Deal and Evidence"] </F>
  [Text] Although the Saudi regime, the world's biggest oil 
producer and exporter, is facing the worst financial crisis in 
its history and is being compelled to cut its general 
expenditure in the 1994 budget by 20 percent, it has signed a 
contract with the United States to purchase 50 airliners for $6 
billion dollars only! Since that regime is no longer capable of 
paying for its purchases in cash due to a drop in liquidity, it 
has been agreed that an American bank will finance the deal. 
  When we know that this deal, in which Clinton is said to 
have 
intervened personally by pressuring Fahd to sign it, will save 
the United States 100,000 jobs whose occupants are threatened 
with dismissal, it becomes very clear how far this servile king 
can go in order to serve his American overlords and to help them 
overcome their pressing economic and social problems and crises. 
Conversely, it also becomes very clear how far the Americans 
can go in order to milk the Saudi regime and plunder its oil 
wealth, which actually belongs to the Arab people in Saudi 
Arabia and the entire Arab nation. 
  With this deal the Saudi regime proves once more that it is 
willing to go to any length in its non-patriotic and anti-Arab 
behavior, which has turned the oil wealth into a scourge for the 
Arab nation. He is no longer part of the Arab nation. In fact, 
he is not concerned about the nation's interests and economic, 
security, and development needs. Here he is rushing to prove 
his loyalty to the United States by offering it services which 
no other agent regime can give. It suffices to say that he has 
contributed, and is contributing, toward the drop in oil prices 
to their lowest level in five years for insisting not to cut his 
production. 
  It is obvious the Al Sa'ud regime has no need for all those 
airliners. It is also obvious that a similar deal could have 
been concluded with other companies at lower cost. But what 
could Fahd do when it was the U.S. President who ordered him to 
sign the deal and the one who intervened, pressured, and also 
announced that he will intervene whenever necessary in order to 
secure commercial deals for his country? Despite this 
intervention, it is only fair to say that Fahd was also 
concerned about securing job opportunities for 100,000 Americans 
now and at any time in the future, and that he was not less 
concerned than Clinton about the U.S. economy and society, 
despite the fact that this concern and subservience to the 
United States is at great financial and political cost to his 
regime. There are many signs and evidence of the bankruptcy and 
financial crisis facing the regime. Furthermore, there are 
indications of a growing religious and civilian opposition to 
the regime's policies and open subservience to the imperialist 
West, despite all the stop-gap political methods to limit and 
absorb this opposition. 
  It may be said that Fahd is behaving this way because he 
counts on the United States to protect his regime and its 
security and future. But such talk is meaningless, since many 
other regimes had once given their loyalty and subservience to 
the United States only to discover later that the United States 
did not guarantee anyone's security except its own security and 
interests. In fact, it helped overthrow those "allied" regimes 
when they were no longer useful and when it was convinced that 
its interests would be served better by an alliance with other 
regimes. But the problem with Al Sa'ud is that they have not 
learned and they are not willing to learn any lesson from what 
has happened.

<F P=106> [Article by Nawwaf Abu-al-Hayja': "The Arab League Between </F>
Blockade of Iraq and Normalization With Zionist Enemy"] 
  [Excerpts] Official reports from the Arab League and 
statements by some Arab officials say that the subject of ending 
Arab boycott of the Zionist enemy will be included in the agenda 
of the next session of the Arab League Council. Officials in 
several Arab states have also been quoted as saying that certain 
governments in the Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, and elsewhere 
will act independently on this subject regardless of the outcome 
of the Arab League meetings to be held at the level of foreign 
ministers. 
  It is astonishing indeed to watch Arab regimes hurtling 
toward Tel Aviv when their governments refuse to even mention 
the subject of lifting the unfair blockade on Iraq -- an Arab 
country and founding member of the Arab League. Worse, some 
regimes are willing to pay billions of dollars in bribes in 
order to prolong this blockade, which has continued for more 
three and a half years now. For its part, the United States has 
pushed, and is still pushing, matters in the direction desired 
by the Zionists, using both the carrot and the stick. Late in 
January 1994, the U.S. Congress approved a bill calling for a 
U.S. arms embargo on any government refusing to end the Arab 
boycott on the Zionist entity and on the foreign companies 
dealing with that entity. [passage omitted] 
  The logic on which the Arab League was founded says that the 
league should act in accordance with higher Arab interests. Do 
these interests now mean approving agreements of abandonment and 
surrender to the Zionist enemy, blockading Iraq and Libya, 
endorsing the occupation of Somalia, and acquiescing to the 
massacre of the Palestinian Arab people -- the massacre that has 
been continuing for more than six consecutive years? 
  Why are these heroes, who are ready with such great 
enthusiasm and unusual encourage to declare the lifting of the 
Arab boycott on the usurper Zionist entity, not showing similar 
enthusiasm and courage toward the continuous criminal blockade 
on Arab Iraq? 
  Their attitude should be at least similar to, or even 
stronger than, the attitude of certain foreign states and 
parties. It is a shame, especially when they have often talked 
about Arab nationalism, Arab solidarity, justice, Arab order, 
and Arab rights. It is as if they meant Zionist, not Arab and 
Zionism, not Arabism. 
  In view of this, one cannot help but wonder about the 
usefulness of the league, now that it has deviated from, in fact 
abandoned, its own principles, disavowed its aims, and has 
become a burden rather than a coordinator for joint Arab action 
and a catalyst for pan-Arab efforts. 
  Three and a half years have passed while the Iraqi people 
have suffered from the blockade of the brothers before the 
enemies, because Iraqi geography says that any blockade on Iraq 
cannot be effective unless it is supported by the regimes in the 
neighboring Arab countries to the west and to the south, 
regardless of who is to the north (Turkey) and who is to the 
east (Iran). Despite this bitter reality, which contradicts all 
Arab values and morals and the principles of the Arab League 
Charter, the subject of the blockade has not been included on 
the agenda of any Arab League Council session. On what basis is 
the boycott of the Zionist enemy now being included in the 
agenda when the Zionist enemy still occupies Palestine, the 
Golan, southern Lebanon, and remains the historical and crucial 
enemy of the Arab nation? [passage omitted]

REUTER had reported that the Lebanese security forces today

detained at dawn today and that initial investigations showed 
that they had planted a bomb next to the altar during the Sunday

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
that Pakistan will continue to assist the Afghan brothers 
despite some unpleasant events. Talking to representatives of 
nongovernmental organizations and international aid agencies at 
[name indistinct] Afghan refugee camp near Peshawar this 
afternoon, she said Pakistan wants the establishment of peace in 
Afghanistan at the earliest possible time. This was necessary 
for speedy reconstruction of Afghanistan. She said the 
representatives of relief agencies to continue assisting the 
Afghan people [sentence as heard]. The prime minister pointed 
out that Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the members of the 
Islamic Conference Organization and other countries have 
appealed to Afghan leaders to stop armed confrontation and 
establish peace in the country. She said Pakistan has not 
closed its border with Afghanistan and all Afghans having valid 
documents are allowed to travel into Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria: Negotiations Going </F>
Round in Vicious Circle; Israel Continues To Exercise Evasion 
Method"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Syria said yesterday that Israel 
continues to use evasion as a method and is trying to perpetuate 
the explosive situation in the occupied Arab territories and to 
create a state of tension and instability in the region. 
  A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Washington 
negotiations are still going round in a vicious circle and that 
the Israeli delegation continues to evade adherence to the peace 
process, first and foremost the full withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights and the other occupied territories. The official added 
that the Washington negotiations have considerably and clearly 
exposed Israel's hostile position toward the peace process. 
"The Israelis continue to raise the same issues and provoke the 
same obstacle with a view to prolonging the negotiations and 
using the wasted time to circumvent the results of the Geneva 
summit, get around the Security Council resolutions, and empty 
them of any substance." 
  The official went on to say that Rabin continues to insist 
on 
the tone of secret negotiations at a high level with the aim of 
torpedoing the negotiations and the U.S. initiative, eclipsing 
the resolutions of international legitimacy, and practicing 
blackmail against Syria, Lebanon, and the Arabs. Plus, Israel 
is going to impose other impossible conditions for the sake of 
playing for time and using the coming years in the service of 
its settlement schemes. 
  The official called on the United States to adopt a firm 
position so that the time will not be wasted, because Syria 
cannot continue to engage in futile negotiations forever or 
allow Israel to lie to world public opinion and say that it is 
continuing the peace process merely to achieve its expansionist 
schemes. 
  The official added that the peace process could collapse if 
Israel continues to ignore Arab demands. And Israel must know 
that there can be no peace in the region without Syria and that 
no agreement concluded with Israel has any hope of continuing or 
being implemented without Syria. Syria has a known and fixed 
position, namely not to relinquish a single inch of its 
territory or the other Arab territories. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By "JORDAN TIMES staff reporter" Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Jordan believes that the only way to ensure the 
protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories is 
through the removal of the settlements in the occupied 
territories, especially in high-tension areas such as Hebron and 
Jerusalem, a senior official told the JORDAN TIMES Wednesday. 
  The Kingdom also wants to see a more active role for the 
United Nations in the Middle East peace negotiations as well as 
in guaranteeing the protection of Palestinian citizens. 
  "Jordan's declared position is that Palestinians in the 
occupied territories have to be protected," said the official, 
who asked he remain anonymous. 
  Jordan, along with its Arab partners to the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations, pulled out of the Washington-based bilateral talks 
early in protest against the massacre of 60 worshippers in 
Hebron last week. 
  The PLO has placed several conditions on the resumption of 
negotiations, including the dismantling of settlements 
especially in Hebron and the Gaza Strip, move the issue of 
settlements from final-status negotiations to be current 
negotiations, disarm settlers and increase the number of 
Palestinian policemen. 
  Israel has already freed around 1,000 Palestinian detainees 
and announced it was ready to disarm 100 settlers. Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, according to reports, was willing 
to accept international observers to supervise the transfer of 
power from Israel to Palestinians, possibly dismantle 
particularly trouble-some settlements, crack down on radical 
Jewish settlers and increse the size of the Palestinian police 
forces. 
  "We believe that the best security arrangements are that 
settlements are dismantled especially in Jerusalem and Hebron, 
the official said. 
  He said that these two areas are especially important 
because 
"of their historic value and the close contact between 
fundamentalist settlers and Palestinian residents in those 
areas." 
  "Jordan also calls for U.N. participation in negotiations," 
the official said. 
  But most importantly, the official said the issue of 
settlements should be moved forward to the current Arab-Israeli 
negotiations instead of relegating the sensitive debate to 
final-status negotiations. 
  "Jordan always believed that the delaying of this issue will 
have dangerous ramifications," the official said. 
  The official said that the head of the PLO political 
department, Faruq Qaddumi, will not visit Amman as previously 
scheduled and has instead gone to New York to discuss the 
proposed U.N. resolution on the Hebron massacre. 
  U.S. and Palestinian diplomats had been holding negotiations 
at the U.N. headquarters in New York to work out disagreements 
on wording and reach a final draft for a U.N. Security 
resolution condemning the Hebron Massacre.

  [Text] Tehran, March 1, IRNA -- Oil has been a major 
political element in the internal and external policies of all 
Third World countries since the Second World War, Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati said here today. Speaking at a 
one-day seminar on future of oil and foreign policy of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, he said that the oil supply and demand 
at the international markets have undergone strategic and 
relatively wide-scale changes. 
  He said oil producing countries which were highly dependant 
on the crude oil revenues in the last decade, suffered heavily 
due to the oil prices fluctuations. OPEC production output rose 
from 14 million BPD in 1985 to the current 23 million BPD 
without tangible rise in the revenues of the member states, 
Velayati said. 
  However, he added, the European Union countries had a total 
revenue of dlrs. 200 billion from 11.8 million barrels of oil 
they consumed in the last year alone. "This is three times as 
much as the amount earned through the export of the similar 
volume of oil by the oil exporting countries, i.e. dlrs. 74 
billion." 
  Citing another example Velayati said Italian tax revenues 
from the two million barrels of oil the country consumed last 
year, were equal to the total revenues of Saudi Arabia of 
selling daily 8 million barrels of crude oil. 
  He elsewhere noted that the prospect of the world energy 
consumption concerning oil and other substitute energies does 
not show a significant change at least in the next two decades, 
and that oil will remain the only existing source of energy. 
  On the gas exports Velayati said Iran is aware of the 
importance of establishing a gas pipeline to Europe, adding that 
the Islamic Republic is willing to mount efforts in this regard 
in a manner that joint interests of Iran, Russia and European 
consumers are ensured.

  [Text] Here is a report just in: Yasir 'Arafat has sent a 
message to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin detailing the PLO terms 
for peace talks resumption. This was reported by Palestinian 
sources in Tunis. They said Sa'ib 'Urayqat traveled from 
Jerusalem to Tunis to deliver the message. The PLO terms are as 
follow: 
  -- Israel will disarm the settlers and permit international 
presence in the territories. 
  -- Israel will stop expropriating Arab lands in the 
territories and building new settlements. 
  -- Israel will restructure several settlements situated 
close 
to Palestinian population centers, such as Netzarim in the Gaza 
Strip, Qiryat Arba', and two settlements in the Jericho area. 
'Arafat suggests that the Netzarim residents should be 
relocated to another settlement in southern Strip, and that 
Palestinians should be allowed to purchase some of the evacuated 
lands.

  [Text] Tunis, 2 Mar (MENA)--A highly-placed Palestinian 
source has stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has 
sent a number of proposals to the Israeli Government in an 
attempt to end the crisis resulting from the massacre at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron in the occupied West Bank and return 
the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to the negotiating 
table. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to 
the Washington peace talks, will hand these proposals to the 
Israelis today. This source disclosed that the proposals, on 
which agreement was reached after the Palestinian leaders met on 
Sunday and Monday, include: 
  First, disarming the Israeli settlers and allowing an 
international presence [tawajud dawli] in the self-rule areas. 
  In a message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, which 'Urayqat 
will deliver, 'Arafat pointed out that these proposals are in 
line with the Declaration of Principles agreement. He said that 
the Cairo agreement provides that the Israeli army will protect 
the settlements while the Palestinian police will be responsible 
for security in the self-rule areas. The source said that 
'Arafat's proposals did not specify the type of international 
presence, UN forces or observers, but was content with the 
phrase "international presence." 
  The Palestinian source said that the second proposal 
requests 
restructuring certain settlements that are close to Palestinian 
population centers or those where extremist Jews live, such as 
the Netzarim settlement near Gaza, which 'Arafat proposed 
merging with the Gush Qatif settlement in south Gaza and Qiryat 
Arba' in Hebron. 'Arafat also proposed that Palestinians 
purchase these settlements. The Palestinian source noted that 
the third proposal requests Israel stop expropriating Arab land 
and building new settlements. He pointed out that 'Arafat has 
become convinced that the current crisis between Israel and the 
PLO can only be solved through direct dialogue between them, not 
by bringing other parties into the crisis. He said that 
intensive diplomatic efforts are under way in Cairo, Washington, 
and other capitals to convince both parties to reach a 
compromise and return to the negotiating table.

  [Text] Tunis, March 2 (AFP) -- PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, in 
"agony" over the Hebron massacre, urged touring Greek Foreign 
Minister Karolos Papoulias to push for international protection 
for Palestinians, Greek officials said Wednesday [2 March]. 
  Papoulias, current chairman of European Union's Ministerial 
Council, told reporters here the Council may be asked to provide 
European troops to an international protection force for the 
Israeli-occupied territories. 
  Papoulias, a long-time friend of 'Arafat, is to brief the 
Council next Monday to report the results of his tour of 
Tunisia, Jordan, Israel, Egypt and Syria. 
  The minister said he contacted several European colleagues 
after his talks here late Tuesday with the PLO chief to tell 
them of 'Arafat's demands. 
  An aide to Papoulias added that 'Arafat was "in agony" over 
the massacre and its consequences for negotiations aimed at 
launching the autonomy accord, which is almost three months 
behind schedule. 
  He "was not very talkative, kept hammering his 
preconditions" 
for restarting the autonomy talks, particularly "security 
guarantees and the disarming of the settlers." 
  Papoulias told 'Arafat that the European Union was "making 
every effort to ensure that the dialogue goes on." 
  "The tragic events of Hebron have created a new situation. 
It will have to be overcome through new measures," Papoulias 
said. 
  The Greek foreign minister also discussed the Hebron 
massacre 
and the autonomy talks with Tunisian President Ben Ali and 
Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya. 
  Papoulias was to visit Tel Aviv later Wednesday to meet with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who has held several 
negotiating sessions with 'Arafat. 
  The PLO has spurned a call from U.S. President Bill Clinton 
to hold snap negotiations to finalise an autonomy deal with 
Israel, while Jordan, Lebanon and Syria broke off talks with 
Israel in support. 
  'Arafat said Tuesday he would insist on UN guarantees to 
protect the Palestinians before resuming peace talks. 
  'Arafat's "bottom line" included the dispatch of 
international peacekeepers, disarming the settlers and 
dismantling some settlements. 
  In New York, the UN Security Council was still struggling 
over a resolution on the massacre while Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali pushed for a UN presence to keep the peace in the 
territories.

  [Text] Cairo, March 3 (AFP)--PLO autonomy negotiator Nabil 
Sha'th left here Thursday [3 March] for London and Washington to 
demand international protection for Palestinians before 
self-rule talks with Israel can resume. 
  Sha'th told reporters before leaving he would talk to 
British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd about ways to "protect the 
Palestinian people and disarm Israeli settlers" after the Hebron 
massacre. 
  He said he would travel on to Washington to meet US 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher on Friday and discuss "measures 
which must be applied to guarantee security for Palestinians 
before negotiations resume" with Israel. 
  Sha'th, an advisor to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, said he will 
also ask the US administration to "adopt a serious position on 
Jewish American groups which collect funds for extremist 
settlers" to attack Palestinians. 
  Nabil Qassis, another PLO member involved in peace talks 
with 
Israel, will join Sha'th in his discussions with US officials. 
  A US official speaking on condition of anonymity said on 
Wednesday that the United States hope the autonomy negotiations 
will resume after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin visits 
Washington from March 14-17. 
  The negotiations to launch self-rule in the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank town of Jericho have been suspended since a Jewish 
settler on Friday shot dead 52 Palestinian worshippers at a 
mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ghawshah, secretary general </F>
of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and PLO Executive 
Committee member, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date 
not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, the Voice of the 
Arabs welcomes you. 
  [Ghawshah] Thank you. 
  [Al-Jundi] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was not the first to 
be perpetrated against the Palestinians living under occupation. 
Following this massacre, numerous question marks hang over the 
peace process. What is the PLO's assessment of the peace 
operation after this incident? 
  [Ghawshah] The crime against our kin in the Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron was doubtless a turning point for the Palestinian 
people's progress and profoundly affected the peace process, 
especially as this bloody assault was not the first of its kind 
by extremist organizations and settlers. Our people have 
already been subjected to many similar assaults. Armed settlers 
have attacked our people, stormed houses, assaulted vehicles, 
and blocked roads while Israeli army and security personnel 
stood by and watched. Despite denunciations and petitions and 
discussions about settler issues, Rabin's government continued 
its policy of allowing settlers to walk around fully armed and 
attack Palestinians. 
  Basically, we view this as a major incident affecting the 
peace operation and halting the talks. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you think this massacre will halt the peace 
process or only postpone it indefinitely? 
  [Ghawshah] This depends on the conduct of Prime Minister 
Rabin and his government and the measures that will be adopted 
following the massacre. They must make a decision disarming all 
settlers. The Israeli Government has only decided to disarm some 
settlers. What also happened is that the Palestinians were 
prevented from laying their martyrs to rest. At the same time, 
the settlers continued to walk around fully armed, something 
that was relayed by television screens worldwide. We say: In 
light of the Rabin government's decisions and judging by how 
seriously it handles this issue and the peace process, we might 
decide to suspend the negotiations instead of halting them 
altogether. We have offered a lot to keep the peace process 
going. We are still saying that if earnest and effective 
decisions are made, primarily providing international protection 
for our people against assault, we might regard what is 
happening as a suspension of the talks, not an end to the peace 
process. 
  [Al-Jundi] Following the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the 
international condemnation of it, observers have spoken about 
the peace process and the basis for negotiations. Regarding the 
Israeli settlements inside the Palestinian self-rule area, is 
there a specific strategy that the Palestinian side will follow 
in the coming phase? 
  [Ghawshah] Since the Madrid conference, the PLO and its 
negotiating delegations have been reiterating that the 
settlements and the settlers constitute an obstacle to peace. 
In all the rounds of talks, the Palestinian delegations have 
been calling for the withdrawal of the settlers and the 
dismantling of the settlements. They have been calling for 
ending this phenomenon, which is considered to be a continuation 
of Israeli aggression and occupation. But because of particular 
factors and circumstances, the discussion of the final status of 
the settlements has been postponed. Now, after the massacre and 
after the world has realized that the main issue is not Israel's 
security, but the Palestinian people's security, it has become 
clear that these settlements are a threat and a powder keg. We 
stress the need to start a serious discussion of the status of 
these settlements. This is particularly so because Rabin has 
stressed that there are security settlements and political 
settlements. We believe some settlements can be dismantled 
while others can be put together pending their dismantling. 
This constitutes a guarantee for peace. But if Rabin and his 
government still insist on their stance, it means they are 
putting out obstacles. Thus, the peace process will remain 
threatened by this powder keg represented by the presence of the 
settlements and armed settlers.

  [Text] PLO Executive Committee member Shafiq al-Hut and 
Fatah Central Committee member Hani al-Hasan have joined hands 
with four PLO Executive Committee members -- 'Abd-al-Rahim 
Malluh, 'Abdallah Hurani, Taysir Khalid, and Abu-Isma'il [Mahmud 
Isma'il] -- in calling for a halt to the negotiations, 
dismantlement of settlements, international protection for 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, and rehabilitating the 
terms of reference of the peace process on the basis of the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions. 
  A responsible Palestinian source has said he has received a 
written approval of this stand by these four PLO Executive 
Committee members from both al-Hut and al-Hasan. 
  In a separate development, nine Palestinian popular unions, 
namely, the Palestinian Workers Union, the Palestinian Teachers 
Union, the Palestinian Students Union, the Palestinian Women's 
Union, the Palestinian Writers and Journalists Union, the 
Palestinian Plastic Arts Union, the Palestinian Peasants Union, 
the Palestinian Artists Union, and the Palestinian Physicians 
and Pharmacists Union, concluded their joint meeting in Tunis on 
1 March. 
  These unions issued a statement, a copy of which was 
obtained 
by AL-RA'Y. The unions held Israel responsible for the massacre 
at holy Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  The statement urged the Arab nation to shoulder its pan-Arab 
and historical responsibility toward the Palestinian people to 
enable them to maintain their steadfastness until the 
achievement of their inalienable rights to self-determination, 
repatriation, and the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state. 
  The statement urged the United States, in its capacity as a 
cosponsor of the peace conference, and U.S. President Clinton to 
end their unlimited support of the Israeli Government. 
  The statement also called on the UN Security Council to take 
immediate and practical measures to dispatch a protection force 
to the occupied territories to protect our people from the 
crimes of Israeli aggressors.

  [Text] Amman, 2 Mar (SANA)--PLO Executive Committee member 
Taysir Khalid has warned against the maneuvers the Rabin 
government is staging by releasing some prisoners whose prison 
terms are about to end, saying that these maneuvers are designed 
to drag the PLO back into the negotiating table on Israeli terms. 
  In a statement distributed here today, Khalid expressed his 
convictions that the Oslo negotiators no longer have ample room 
for maneuvering. He added that they must halt the current 
negotiations and abrogate the Oslo and Cairo agreements. They 
should not return to the negotiations unless the Rabin 
government pledges to honor international legitimacy's 
resolutions on settlements and comply with the terms of 
reference agreed upon for the negotiating process. 
  Khalid asserted that it it fails to take such measures, then 
the Palestinian leadership must tender its resignation and call 
the Palestine National Council into session to elect a new 
leadership. 
  For his part, PLO Executive Committee member 'Abd-al-Rahim 
Malluh has said: We reject Yitzhaq Rabin's perception of 
international protection for our people in the occupied 
territories. He indicated that Israel is attempting to absorb 
the indignation elicited by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
and to cover up for this heinous crime. 
  Malluh asserted that the meetings held by the PLO Executive 
Committee to consider its negotiating position in the aftermath 
of the Hebron massacre were illegal. He added that the members 
attending these meetings were a minority, and that most members 
did not attend.

<F P=106> [Report by Salah 'Azazi] </F>
  [Text] PLO Executive Committee Member Jamal al-Surani has 
said that the entire Palestinian people are calling for breaking 
off the negotiations with Israel. He held the United States 
responsible for the Zionist massacre in Hebron. There is no 
point continuing the negotiated settlement until the U.S. 
position becomes clear, he said. 
  Al-Surani assailed demands by Clinton and Warren Christopher 
that the two sides demonstrate self-restraint, as though 
Palestine was the aggressor against Israel. He said: I pray 
God to remove the scales from the eyes of those who imagine 
something good will come of the U.S. position. It is the United 
States that provides weapons, aid, and all forms of support for 
Israel. 
  Al-Surani said the settlement option leads nowhere with the 
racist usurpers who are embraced by the United States. He 
called for a prompt meeting by the Arab foreign ministers, or 
else the Arabs will be colluding against each other. An Arab 
summit to react to the massacre must be held, he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Washington talks, by Sa'id Mu'addi, place and 
date not given; from the "With the Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the 
Palestinian side in the Washington negotiations: Good evening. 
You have conveyed a message from Yasir 'Arafat to Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. What does the message contain? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, the message was conveyed to the Israeli 
negotiators by telephone last Friday. The message urges the 
Israeli Government to make four moves. First, to disarm the 
settlers; second, to dismantle the settlements in Gaza and 
Hebron; third, to provide international protection; and fourth, 
to place the settlements issue at the top of the agenda. The 
Israel Government replied by adopting certain decisions, which 
do not rise to the required level and which lack seriousness. 
The PLO Executive Committee studied the issue and found that 
the decisions and replies did not contribute to peace efforts. 
  In light of the incidents that followed the massacre in the 
occupied Palestinian territories, including the settlers' 
continued terrorist and provocative activity and the Israeli 
Army's continued killings of Palestinian citizens, the Israeli 
Government is once again required to take practical and 
realistic measures, rather than mere formalities, like the ones 
it has taken in the past. This is exactly what happened and 
this is what was conveyed to the Israeli delegations in 
Washington. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Where do we stand now regarding the 
future Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
  ['Urayqat] I believe that negotiations are not a goal in and 
of themselves. They are a means to achieve a goal. We believe 
that as a result of the terrorist operation in the city of 
Hebron, the current negotiations face a sharp turning point. 
Any negotiations that do not deal with settlements will be 
fruitless. Therefore, Israeli measures should deal with content 
rather than form. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib: Have you ruled out the resumption of 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations before the PLO's conditions are 
met? 
  ['Urayqat] We are not talking about conditions. We state 
clearly that life will not go on as it used to do before the 
massacre that took place against our people in Hebron. The U.S. 
Administration took procedures to move the negotiations from one 
place to another. This is a procedural matter and cannot 
influence the situation. What is required now is serious 
Israeli and U.S. moves. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much. 
  ['Urayqat] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the bilateral talks with Israel, by an 
unidentified reporter, place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Urayqat] Anger prevails in the occupied territory 
and people here have called on the international community to 
move swiftly to provide international protection for the 
defenseless Palestinian people. All forces and figures in 
Jericho participated in a demonstration this morning in which 
they called for international protection and the disarming of 
the settlers. After the demonstration ended safely, the Army 
interfered and fired at people killing a 17-year old youth. 
When the Army started shooting I headed for the market downtown 
where, in my direction, they fired tear gas and a stun grenade 
which hit me in my left leg. Praise be to God, there are some 
bruises, but the injury is not serious. 
  However, what is more important than all this is that since 
the terrorist act carried out by the Israeli settler in the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque, the Israeli Army has killed 21 Palestinian 
youths. The Israeli Army is indiscriminately firing at our 
people. As Israel hides its crimes by standing behind settlers 
or its terrorist cliques, the regular Israeli Army is killing 
people and carrying out terrorist acts. This situation 
strengthens the Palestinian demand for international protection 
in accordance with the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. 
  [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat: Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin urged the PLO to resume the talks and the Israeli 
Army is continuing brutal and repressive acts on the ground. 
How can we reconcile these two extremist Israeli stands? 
  ['Urayqat] It is impossible to reconcile these two stands. 
Rabin must make a choice between settlements and peace, because 
the two cannot coexist. This message was conveyed to Rabin last 
Friday through his delegation in Washington. The PLO told him 
that he has to move toward four things: First, disarming the 
settlers; second, providing international protection for the 
Palestinian people; third, dismantling settlements in Gaza and 
Hebron; and fourth, placing the settlements issue at the top of 
the talks agenda. We believe that if the issue of settlements 
is not at the top of the talks agenda these talks will be 
useless. Regrettably, Rabin's responses, which came during the 
cabinet meeting, were weak and meaningless formalities. We want 
Rabin to make the appropriate decisions. The talks in 
themselves are not the objective. 
  On the other hand, the U.S. Administration has tried to 
limit 
the danger by adopting procedural measures such as moving the 
venue of the talks. It ignored the substantial issues; namely, 
the settlements and international protection for the Palestinian 
people. This thing places the peace process in a deadlock. We, 
the Palestinian people, seek a just, genuine, and comprehensive 
peace on all Palestinian and Arab fronts. We want peace in 
accordance with the international charters and UN resolutions, 
particularly Resolutions 242 and 338. Rabin, however, cannot 
hold talks just for the sake of holding talks. 
  [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the PLO yesterday 
suspended negotiations with Israel pending the meeting of its 
conditions regarding the occupied territories: Providing 
protection for the Palestinian residents and disarming settlers. 
In your opinion, can these negotiations resume without these 
PLO conditions being met? 
  ['Urayqat] As I said, the negotiations cannot be an end in 
and of themselves. The PLO sent a host of questions to the 
Israeli Government, headed by the demands that I have mentioned 
to you. We are waiting for the Israeli Government's response. 
The negotiations are suspended now. The PLO is holding 
extensive international and Arab contacts, covering the United 
States, Russia, Europe, and Arab states. Under these particular 
circumstances, we hope that we will be able to revive Arab 
coordination. This is because it was a great decision by other 
Arab delegations toward entrenching the concept of a 
comprehensive solution when they suspended the negotiations in 
Washington in the wake of the massacre. I believe that it is 
high time that the Arab nation moves toward devising a 
comprehensive strategy. Likewise, negotiations on other tracks 
cannot continue for the sake of negotiations only. 
  [Reporter] Brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat, some experts say that a 
unified Arab stand demanding that Israel implement UN 
resolutions practically annuls the possibility of negotiating 
the Oslo-Jericho [as heard] agreement, which specifies an 
interim period for the occupied territories before arriving at 
the final status. Can the Oslo agreement be abandoned? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, the question is not one of abandoning 
any 
agreements. Everyone realizes that the Palestinian track in the 
peace process has certain peculiarities. We are not talking 
about an occupied part of the Palestinian territory. We are 
talking about occupied Palestine as a whole, about all aspects 
of life in Palestine under the control of the occupation. 
Therefore, the question does not concern the method of the 
Israeli implementation and withdrawal, be it phased or not 
phased; the question has to do with listing a basic item on the 
Palestinian-Israeli agenda, which is the issue of settlements. 
In the past, Israel insisted that this issue be postponed until 
the final status is discussed. During the negotiations, when 
they were asked how they will provide protection or prevent the 
settlers from carrying out terrorist operations against the 
Palestinian people, they said: This is our responsibility. 
Last Friday, this Israeli responsibility was put to the test 
and failed. Israel proved that it cannot do that. Therefore, 
the question of placing settlements on the agenda is essential. 
In addition, there is the issue of international protection. 
If Israel withdraws and redeploys its forces, then why should 
it mind an effective international presence in the Palestinian 
territory to provide protection for 2 million defenseless 
Palestinians? 
  [Reporter] In other words, you are demanding international 
protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, the 
disarming of the settlers, and the raising of the issue of 
settlements at the table of negotiations. Otherwise, you will 
not go to the negotiations with Israel? 
  ['Urayqat] The decision will be made by the leadership. 
However, I personally believe that any negotiations that do not 
place the issue of settlements at the top of the agenda will be 
useless. 
  [Reporter] Sa'ib 'Urayqat, are you personally optimistic 
about the resolution that the UN Security Council may issue? 
  ['Urayqat] In fact, I realize that the U.S. Administration 
is 
being hesitant. I realize that from the outset, the U.S. 
Administration intervened and focused on procedural issues 
rather than on substance. This is not promising. The U.S. bias 
toward Israel is very clear. I am not very optimistic about the 
U.S. position, specifically at the UN Security Council. 
  [Reporter] Thank you, brother Sa'ib 'Urayqat for this 
interview with radio Monte Carlo. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you.

  [Text] Brother Bassam Abu-Sharif [adviser to PLO Chairman 
'Arafat] has called for the removal of the Jewish settlements 
from the occupied territories and proposed that the United 
States finance their purchase for the Palestinians. He said: 
Following the Hebron massacre that claimed the lives of 53 
Palestinians, it is necessary to remove the Jerwish settlements 
from the occupied territories to bring about peace between the 
Palestinians and the Israelis. He stressed that the Hebron 
massacre provided an opportunity for a two-stage settlement, and 
said that the lesson that has been learned shows clearly the 
need for the Israeli Army to withdraw from the occupied 
territories in implementation of the UN resolutions. 
  Brother Bassam Abu-Sharif also said that U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's invitation to the Palestinians and the Israelis to 
hold serious negotiations in Washington gives an opportunity to 
President Clinton to prove to the Arab and Islamic world his 
interest in peace. Concluding, he said that it is Washington's 
duty to intervene, in its capacity as a partner in the peace 
process, to completely end the Israeli occupation and to finance 
the purchase of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip for the Palestinians.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, Amman, Tunis -- AL-JUMHURIYAH has 
continued its telephone contacts with the office of Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis, some Palestinian leaders in 
Amman, and the intifadah leadership to explore their views about 
the Palestinian response to the Zionist occupation authorities' 
massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque, which resulted in 400 
Palestinian casualties. The office of Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat's in Tunis stressed that the Palestinian 
leadership has decided to recall the Palestinian delegations 
from negotiations with the Zionist entity in Paris, Washington, 
Cairo, and Taba. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-JUMHURIYAH, As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, 
leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement-Bayt al-Maqdis, said the 
Zionist crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque was planned and 
premeditated by the occupation authorities and the troops in 
charge of guarding the Ibrahimi Mosque. This is has been shown 
by the fact that the Zionist assailants withdrew freely with all 
their weapons under the cover of the enemy troops surrounding 
the Ibrahimi Mosque. Al- Tamimi asked: How can an individual 
-- as the occupation authorities are claiming -- kill and wound 
400 people? He said: We have made a clear and specific 
decision deeming every Zionist inside the occupied territory a 
target of our revolutionaries' bullets. He added: We will 
carry out the Palestinian response inside the occupied territory 
before the blood of martyrs dries. He urged all other 
Palestinian factions to stop their denunciations and to embark 
on real action that restores the dignity of the blood that has 
been spilled at the Ibrahimi Mosque. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hebron Massacre Between Words And Action"] </F>
  [Text] The international community now has a golden 
opportunity to consolidate peace in the Middle East. That is, 
if it knows how to settle the settlements issue swiftly and 
without dilution. 
  Anyone who hears international reports on "terrorism" tends 
to think that it is a tradition which was born Arab, lived Arab, 
and is going to die Arab. It is most likely that its definition 
and classification will remain so for some time. 
  But Barukh Goldstein and before him the perpetrator of 
Rishon 
LeZiyyon...through to Menahem Begin, "hero" of the King David 
Hotel operation -- we do not want to make a long list -- confirm 
that terrorism is not necessarily Arab. It is actually a 
serious phenomenon which needs to be studied, reexamined, and 
radically tackled with an open mind that does not condemn 
haphazardly or use double standards. 
  We have heard so much about Arab "terrorism" that we are now 
tired of this tone. We realize that it is actually a planned 
bias designed to conceal right and the demand for it. If we are 
today promised responsible international action on an ugly 
massacre like the Hebron massacre, the first signs in the 
Security Council have not been encouraging, as positions have -- 
as expected -- split between those who are content with verbal 
condemnation and the advocates of practical measures. 
  Goldstein's crime is a state rather than an emotional 
individual reaction. It is a state stemming from a political 
strategy, a conditioned upbringing, and convictions which are 
dangerous in their extremist and closed-mindedness and see 
others' obtaining of humanly acceptable minimum rights as a 
direct threat to them. In view of this situation, it is 
impossible to divide a solution or camouflage a settlement. 
  The world has avoided tackling the problem in the occupied 
territories and senior politicians have deliberately ignored 
what is happening, using numerous excuses all of which cannot 
paper over the cracks or convince a child. And today the 
present Israeli government claims that it is not responsible for 
the convulsions of radical settlers like Goldstein, whom the 
Likud government supported for years. But the ruling Labor 
Party will not be able to wash its hands of its responsibility 
-- both during its rule before and after Likud -- for planting 
scores of "security" or "religious" settlements whose residents 
believe the Palestinians have no right to coexist with them. 
  So any compromise attempt for a settlement that does not 
include a solution to the crux of the question is doomed to 
failure. It is futile to talk today about containing reactions 
without moving quickly to remove the settlements. Their 
continuation is unacceptable politically because it recognizes 
the legitimacy of occupation and its implementation and rewards 
occupation by force. It is also unacceptable at the security 
level because it does not guarantee any peace for unarmed 
Palestinians or secure credibility for their promised "local 
authority." It is also unacceptable demographically because it 
is simply a population time bomb.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Palestinian Demands -- Serious and </F>
Crucial"] 
  [Text] In the aftermath of the barbaric massacre in 
Hebron, the world has begun to realize and understand the 
reality of the dangers posed by the settlements' phenomenon on 
the chances of peace. It has become abundantly clear that 
settlement activity and peace are incompatible. Moreover, the 
only way to prevent the recurrence of the Hebron massacre in 
other Palestinian towns is to begin dismantling the settlements, 
whose establishment rational Israeli circles admit was a mistake 
in the first place. Furthermore, the continued existence of the 
settlements is a more serious mistake whether with regard to the 
chances of coexistence or the physical presence of the 
defenseless Palestinian people. 
  The occupied territories' residents do not view this demand, 
which the international community should comply with, as another 
prerequisite for resuming the talks regardless of what it is 
called. This is because disarming the settlers and dismantling 
the settlements, whose existence fundamentally contradicts any 
rational concept of peace, is the only correct beginning. It is 
also the duty of the international community to provide an 
effective force to protect the Palestinians and separate them 
from the armed elements, be they settlers or otherwise, and 
maintain security and safety. 
  The United States, which has backed Israel against any move 
in the Security Council to provide the international force being 
called for by the Palestinians, should consider the formation of 
that force a humanitarian demand that can end daily frictions 
and confrontations between Palestinian residents and the Israeli 
forces, resulting in death and injury. 
  What increases pain and suffering is that the Israeli 
authorities, instead of allowing the residents legitimate 
freedom to express their grief and anger, they rush their forces 
to confront the marches and the demonstrating processions. 
Thus, the number of martyrs and wounded goes up. This in 
itself is an indication that the calm for which the Israeli 
authorities are striving cannot be achieved through violence, 
but by permitting the relatives of the victims, the wounded, and 
other residents to express their feelings and pain, while 
removing the chances of confrontation and friction between them 
and the Israeli forces. Enough victims have fallen so far.

<F P=106> ["Text" of "exclusive" interview with Choe Yong-no, North </F>
Korean ambassador to Iran, by an unidentified correspondent; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] On the pretext of North Korea's 
nuclear program, the United States has deployed its Patriot 
missiles in South Korea. How do you assess the U.S. and South 
Korean Governments' stance on this? 
  [Choe Yong-no] In order to assess this issue, we should seek 
the roots of the matter and basically see on what basis the 
nuclearization of the Korean peninsula is discussed. 
  The issue of the nuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
should be assessed from two positions. The first is that the 
United States has deployed its most advanced arms in South Korea 
and since these arms threaten our country, it is necessary for 
us to arm ourselves. 
  The second is that this is an American plot. By fabricating 
various documents the United States has sparked a commotion on 
the manufacturing of nuclear arms in North Korea. We have 
repeatedly stated that we do not have any wish to manufacture 
such weapons, that we have no potential in this field, and that 
we do not wish to manufacture these items. 
  We still do not have a nuclear power plant in our country. 
There is only one research center and a few small reactors that 
we are using for tests. This center has some needs that had to 
be met before a nuclear power plant could become operational, 
for which these reactors were used. 
  Related to this, the IAEA has inspected our country many 
times and has stressed that our nuclear policy is completely 
peaceful and there is no doubt in this. A few years after these 
inspections they inspected our military bases and said that we 
manufactured nuclear arms there. This is a blatant U.S. plot; 
this superpower is constantly looking for a pretext. 
  Unfortunately, the IAEA has become a U.S. puppet, is 
pursuing 
a policy of double standards toward our country, and is accusing 
us of being in the process of nuclearization. This is at a time 
when some U.S. minions such as Israel and South Africa are 
equipped with the most advanced nuclear weapons and the 
West--the United States--is not acting against them in any way. 
  We cannot tolerate their policy of double standards and 
hostility, and have thus told them that they should rectify 
their unjust stance. For this reason, last March we stated that 
we would be leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  We have repeatedly stated that the nuclear issue in the 
Korean peninsula should be solved through direct talks. Until 
now we have had two official talks and several talks at the 
level of Korean and U.S. experts. 
  Recently the United States has trampled on all the 
agreements 
and issues to which we had reached a conclusion. Thus, the 
talks on the nuclear issue have been overtly placed at an 
impasse. 
  In our opinion, the United States has no intention to solve 
the nuclear issue through peaceful means but is mostly 
interested in solving the issue through force and pressure. For 
this reason, our country has issued a statement underlining our 
decisive stances. 
  Among the reasons that led to the above statement was the 
fact that the United States trampled on all the agreements that 
we had reached in New York. American acts and approaches are 
considered blatant crimes and a flagrant violation of 
international resolutions. 
  We once again stress that we do not wish to hold further 
talks with the United States. Also, we hope that the government 
and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is our good 
ally, will stand next to us. 
  If today we submit to America's incorrect acts, tomorrow it 
will be the turn of Iran, and then another country, to be placed 
under America's yoke. 
  [Correspondent] As you know, the government of Pyongyang 
recently expressed its concern over the launching of Japan's H-2 
satellite and has said that this act shows that Japan's military 
strength has reached a sensitive point. How do you assess this 
issue? 
  [Choe] This issue is connected more with Japan's 
militarism. The Japanese are more active than anyone else in 
the manufacture of nuclear arms. A few days ago we received 
news that the Japanese will begin operation of a nuclear 
accelerator reactor. This reactor is the third such reactor in 
the world. The Japanese have stored a large quantity of 
plutonium and these reactors can manufacture several thousand 
nuclear bombs. 
  This is considered a dangerous act in eastern Asia because 
the launching of a space satellite is mostly connected with the 
collection of information on regional countries. Therefore, 
regional countries are worried about such aggressive acts. 
  The Japanese are the first and only country to have been 
harmed by the nuclear bomb. Therefore, they should not seek to 
develop such arms, in view of their bitter experience, and 
should be more interested in nuclear disarmament and the end of 
mass destruction. 
  [Correspondent] As you know, Mr. Ambassador, in Europe, 
which 
the Westerners consider the cradle of civilization, a war of 
attrition and dangerous genocide is taking place in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your country's stance on the Serbs' 
crimes and savageries and on the silence of international forums? 
  [Choe] International forums have focused their attention on 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. We want a solution to the war 
and the conflicts in the region through peaceful means without 
any massacres. 
  Unfortunately it is very regrettable that international 
forums are silent and have failed to solve the problem. 
  [Correspondent] In view of the fact that you were considered 
a Soviet ally, what are relations like with regional countries, 
especially Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union? 
  [Choe] Trade with Russia continues and relations are the 
same. We also have political-commercial relations with the CIS 
members. 
  We had one embassy in Moscow in the past. Now we have 
several embassies in the region. Since peace, friendship, and 
the preservation of the independence of all countries is part of 
our foreign policy, we have no problems in establishing 
relations with any country that respects the principle of mutual 
rights. 
  As for Russia, there is no place for worry. Relations are 
good. But there is one thing that should be noted and that is 
that Mr. Yeltsin should not follow America around too much and 
make some effort to stand on his own two feet. 
  [Correspondent] In view of your country's economic growth, 
in 
which direction is your country moving: toward 
industrialization, agriculture, or...? [ellipsis as published] 
  [Choe] On the basis of President Kim Il-song's policies, our 
basic policy grants priority to heavy industries, while light 
industries and agriculture are second in priority. 
  On the basis of this theory, we have sought to develop the 
country for two to three decades. Last year we witnessed the 
end of the Third Seven-Year Plan. However, we have set the 
period beginning this year and the next three years as a period 
during which we will prepare the next plan. 
  During these three years, we will grant more priority to 
agriculture, light industries, and trade. 
  [Correspondent] How much of your technology depends on 
foreign countries and how much operates independently? 
  [Choe] We supply our needs mostly from domestic resources. 
However, we import some of the raw materials that we lack in our 
country. 
  Our country definitely lacks some industrial installations 
such as petrochemical refineries. Therefore, we have to import 
these installations and complexes from other countries. 
  [Correspondent] Which country does your country primarily 
depend on? 
  [Choe] Our economic relations cannot be described as being 
dependent on one country. We have trade relations with Asian 
countries and especially with neighboring countries. Before the 
end of the 1980's we had extensive trade and industrial 
relations with the Eastern Bloc. After the disintegration of 
Eastern Europe, our current relations were automatically 
created. But it is not as though our major trade and economic 
relations were dependent on Eastern Europe. 
  It should be noted that we have no relations with the 
United States and Japan because both these countries have a 
colonialist attitude and have imposed economic sanctions on our 
country for decades. Thus, our nation does not have any good 
feelings about these two countries. 
  Since the 1950's, the United States has been implementing 
its 
imperialistic policy toward us. It has always been seeking to 
destroy our socialist system, and in many cases we have been 
threatened by them. 
  The Americans have stationed themselves to the south of our 
country and are striving to occupy and destroy the Korean 
peninsula and are always plotting their objectives. 
  [Correspondent] How are relations with your neighbors and 
what is your country's foreign policy concerning your neighbors? 
  [Choe] We have good relations with countries like China, 
with 
which we share common borders. We have traditionally had good 
relations with our neighbors. However, there is strong dislike 
between us and the Japanese because of the great crimes they 
perpetrated against our country and people during World War II, 
which can never be forgotten. 
  [Correspondent] What is the per capita income, the gross 
national product in your country? 
  [Choe] Because our country's general policy focuses on the 
people's welfare, emphasis is placed on increased production and 
the government's policy is to ensure good living conditions for 
the people. 
  We have adopted various methods to increase our GNP, but I 
am 
not aware of its precise figure. I should say that our country 
is basically different from other countries because our 
government does not tax the people; as far as I know, there is 
no other country that does not tax its people. 
  Education is compulsory and free in our country. University 
education is also free and everyone can attend. 
  We call this method that has been put forth by our leaders 
as 
a "policy of affection," which is aimed at friendship with the 
people. Needless to say, our surplus GNP is used to meet the 
people's needs. 
  [Correspondent] What measures have you considered taking to 
replace tax revenues? 
  [Choe] The surplus GNP and any other government income is 
set 
aside for the next year and some percent of the general GNP is 
used instead of tax revenues to meet the people's needs and to 
run the government. 
  Another point that should be explained is that JAHAN-E ESLAM 
is known to our people. The majority of our people are 
acquainted with it and always consider your newspaper to be 
among the frontline newspapers. 
  On 19 March your newspaper published a commentary on our 
country's nuclear issue, which coincided with our decision to 
leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Many countries 
placed pressures on us to return to this pact. In your 
commentary you said that U.S. pressure was the reason we decided 
to leave the pact and that other countries are wrong to insist 
that we return. 
  Your newspaper's commentary was cited in our country. This 
shows that your newspaper was sufficiently aware of the crisis 
and recent incidents. We hope that your newspaper will 
carefully reflect the official stance of our government, nation, 
and country.
