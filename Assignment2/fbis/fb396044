<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad </F>
Emami-Kashani, interim Friday prayers leader, in Tehran on 25 
February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The people have become 
indifferent toward their own destiny, and the destiny of the 
world of Islam; for example, the government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has once again declared its readiness to send 
troops to Bosnia- Herzegovina to act as peacekeeping forces. If 
the world Muslims gave only one-tenth of the importance that the 
Islamic Republic gives to the Bosnian Muslims, and if the 
governments of other Islamic countries possessed only 
one-hundredth of the resolute will that our Islamic system has 
in its attitude toward the conditions of Muslims in that country 
-- as well as Muslims in Palestine and other parts of the world 
-- then the situation in Bosnia, or for that matter Palestine 
and other parts of the Islamic world would have been totally 
different today. 
  It is because of indifference that we have this situation 
today. In particular, during this auspicious month of Ramadan, 
the great number of preachers who deliver so many Friday prayer 
sermons in so many great and splendid mosques throughout the 
vast land of Islam must undertake efforts to make the people 
aware of their issues and inform them about what the world is 
doing to them: that is that world arrogance is taking control of 
some Muslim countries while at the same time attempting to bring 
the rest of them under its control too. It is one of our duties 
to make people fully aware of such matters. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tehran, [KEYHAN News Sources] -- Once again in 
Tehran rumors of Rafsanjani's resignation as president of the 
republic are heating up. The reason for this is a report 
published in the 1 Esfand [20 February] issue of HAMSHAHRI. 
According to this report, on Saturday 30 Bahman (19 February) at 
a meeting of deputy ministers and chiefs of the nation's 
administrative organizations Rafsanjani said among other things 
that "no change" will be made in the Islamic Republic's revised 
constitution, and, "I will work in another of the government's 
fortifications as a soldier of the revolution." 
  On the other hand, some observers consider the comment about 
no change in the Constitution to be due to the fact that it is 
said that with the change in the Constitution Rafsanjani wants 
to eliminate from this law the provision that one person can 
serve only two consecutive terms as president of the republic, 
in order to be able to serve a third term in that office. 
However, in the Islamic Republic the procedure for revising or 
changing the Constitution has not been specified in legal terms. 
  There is only the fact that in 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 
1990] Khomeyni appointed a council of his own choosing and 
arrangement to revise the Constitution, and the new Constitution 
is the result of that revision. The most important changes made 
in the first Constitution are separating the position of the 
leader of the revolution from that of source of emulation, and 
the other is eliminating the position of prime minister and 
designating the president of the republic as the government's 
highest executive officer. 
<H5>  `We Have No Problem' </H5>
  Our sources in Iran write that if the 
Khamene'i-bazaar-clergy 
group had not tied Rafsanjani's hands by ousting his colleagues 
and close associates such as Mohsen Nurbakhsh, Mohammad Hashemi 
and others, Rafsanjani would probably have begun a battle to 
revise the Constitution and open the way for a third term of his 
presidency. However, with the repeated defeats Rafsanjani has 
suffered, the likelihood of his resignation is now much greater 
than the likelihood that he will open the way for a third term 
as president of the republic (see also our report under the 
headline "God Willing It Is a Cat" on page 12 of this issue. See 
also the column "Obvious and Between the Lines.") 
  Rafsanjani, who has fallen into difficulties on all sides, 
spoke at those meetings of "relative resolution of problems" in 
the country and added that the gains under the First Five-Year 
Plan were "positive." He said: "Infrastructure problems such as 
water and electricity, shipping and transportation, raw 
materials, reconstruction of factories and the growth of 
employment have been relatively solved. Conditions are 
completely normal and we have no problem with the reconstruction 
of the country. We are producing more than ever. For example, 
cement production has grown 5 percent over last year. If there 
is stagnation, where is this cement going? 
  Rafsanjani said the recent changes are "nonpolitical" and 
said the main reason for these changes was that "some officials" 
have remained in the same position since the beginning of the 
revolution.

  [Text] Reports from Tehran say martial law has been 
declared in the province of Sistan va Baluchestan and military 
armored vehicles were positioned in strategic places in Zahedan 
and other cities in this province. At the same time, police 
patrol cars continually pass through the city. 
  Although the cities are apparently calm, they are full of 
disorder. The roads between the cities are reported restless. 
Reports show that armed Baluchis attack automobiles carrying 
armed forces. In attacks that took place between 11 and 16 
Bahman [31 January-5 February], a number of revolutionary guards 
were killed and wounded. Likewise, three police personnel were 
taken hostage by the Baluchis and there is not yet any 
information about what became of them. One of the attacks, 
during which tens of people were killed and wounded, took place 
on the Nikshahr-Iranshahr Road. 
  The National Security Council, meeting in continuous 
session, 
issued a statement attributing the "revolts" in Zahedan to the 
work of "elements" who have "lost their interests during 
security operations by the Islamic Republic's security forces," 
and in this statement, in contradiction to previous statements, 
it called those "elements" "brigands and smugglers." 
  According to a report from Radio Tehran, 'Ali Khamene'i, the 
leader of the Islamic Republic who is also commander in -chief 
of the armed forces, designated minister of the interior 'Ali 
Mohammad Basharati-Jahromi to take his place for three years in 
the police forces. 
  In the relevant order, Khamene'i gave Basharati "full 
authority" to establish order and security in the country. On 
the other hand 'Ali Sham'khani, commander of the Islamic 
Republic's Naval Forces, went to Pakistan last Saturday. On this 
trip he will meet with various Pakistani officials. Political 
observers connect Sham'khani's trip with the ongoing disturbance 
and unrest in Baluchestan. Officials of the Islamic Republic 
believe that the Baluchi rebels get most of the weapons they use 
to fight the armed forces from Pakistan. 
  It is worth noting that the Islamic regime's officials spoke 
of uprisings months ago and studied ways to fight it in the 
Supreme Council for National Security. Observers say that 
despite the government's willingness to fight the uprisings, 
because thinking has been done only from the technical and 
military standpoint, there are likely to be larger and greater 
uprisings in other Iranian cities. The same observers believe 
that if there is an uprising in Tehran, the police will have 
very little luck putting it down.

  [Text] After severe clashes and shooting between opponents 
of the Islamic Republic regime and the revolution guards in the 
city of Zahedan and the discovery of several active opposition 
networks in Khuzestan, a broad wave of arrests started in the 
provinces of Sistan va Baluchestan and Khuzestan. Last Tuesday 
and Wednesday the city of Zahedan witnessed an all-out war. 
  A group of armed men who were apparently protesting the 
destruction of a Sunni mosque in Mashhad began demonstrating 
against the regime in a mosque in the center of Zahedan. 
JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI's correspondent reports that they tore Islamic 
Republic flags and chanted slogans against the leaders of the 
Islamic government. 
  At the same time, revolution guards and policemen, who had 
prepared the city for a celebration of the anniversary of 
Ayatollah Khomeyni's arrival in Iran, fired on the demonstrators 
and received return fire from them. 
  For about half a day Khayyam Street in the center of the 
city 
of Zahedan and the surrounding areas became a complete war zone 
and the scene of heavy fighting. 
  Several residents of the city told news correspondents that 
the windows of their homes had been broken by bullets. 
  IRNA gave no further details, but it insisted that the 
demonstrators are counterrevolutionaries and that these 
incidents mostly take place on the days of the anniversary of 
the revolution, and it added: The hezbollah nation resisted the 
counterrevolutionaries, and despite the situation that 
developed, the ceremonies were held. Figures on the numbers 
killed and wounded have not yet been published. 
  Reliable reports from the province of Khuzestan also tell of 
an atmosphere of unrest that is worrisome for the regime. Last 
week a group making contact with news agencies and Iranian and 
foreign publications reported mass arrests of their friends and 
associates. On the other hand, the Islamic Republic Government 
published a statement according to which national and army 
officials have the direct permission of the president of the 
republic to leave the country at any time. The issuance of such 
an order by the government, in view of the existing 
circumstances in Iran, indicates various kinds of problems. 
  Based on reports received from Iran, the unrest in Zahedan 
began when a report was received from Mashhad that the regime 
intended to destroy the Sunni mosque in Mashhad. The protest 
against this began initially with a gathering that took 
political sanctuary in Zahedan's Maki Mosque, and then it led to 
a demonstration where attacks were made against the decorations, 
lamps, and placards, which were made to mark the beginning of 
the Ten Days of Dawn celebration. In this attack two 
revolutionary guardsmen were killed and several of them were 
wounded. 
  According to the newsletter of the expatriate organization 
HEZB-E MELLAT-E IRAN, Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid, Friday Imam of 
Zahedan, is one of the wounded. His wounds are said to be 
"severe." 
  Talks with Mowlavi 'Abdolhamid by the Islamic Republic's 
representatives, who had come from Tehran to calm the unrest, 
ended with no result. 
  In the midst of this, 'Ali Khamene'i, commander in chief of 
the armed forces, appointed 'Ali Mohammad Basharati to replace 
him for three years on the police force so the regime will be 
better able to resist uprisings. The Islamic government also 
staged a demonstration on its own behalf in Zahedan. In this 
demonstration the regime's mercenaries chanted slogans in favor 
of the government and against what they called 
counterrevolutionaries.

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] On Saturday, 9 Bahman 1372 [29 January 1994] the 
Majles began studying the 7,968-billion-toman national budget 
for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. The budget bill 
was presented to the Majles on 30 Azar [21 December] by 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the republic. Statements 
from the Majles and opinions expressed in the Islamic Republic's 
economic circles concerning the 1373 budget are focused on three 
basic points: the assessment of oil revenues for the coming 
fiscal year, Note 25 of the budget bill concerning the prices of 
some government services and goods, and finally the issue of 
foreign debt repayment. 
<H5>  Oil Revenue </H5>
  The most important point of debate for the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget is naturally the question of foreign 
exchange revenues from crude oil exports. In the bill presented 
by the government, 22,000 billion rials[R] of the government's 
R34,000 billion in revenues, equal to $12.8 billion, is 
calculated based on the sale of oil. This amount, which is 
roughly equal to Iran's oil revenues in the current solar year, 
is being severely criticized by the deputies. 
  The deputies in the majority faction of the Majles consider 
the revenues from the sale of oil as projected in the budget 
bill to be "unrealistic." Finally, after much discussion, on 
Sunday 10 Bahman [30 January] they decreased the figure to 
$10.15 billion. The note pertaining to oil revenues, which was 
approved by the Majles, makes no reference to the volume of 
exports or to the price per barrel of oil. To the figure of 
$10.15 billion must be added the $600 million expected from 
natural gas exports. 
  We note that according to Aqazadeh, Iran's petroleum 
minister, oil revenues from 1 Farvardin 1372 [21 March 1993] to 
30 Dey [20 January 1994] the same year reached $11.38 billion. 
This figure was $2.8 billion, or about 20 percent less than the 
projected amount. 
  The projected figure of $12.8 billion in oil revenues in 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's proposed budget was severely criticized in 
the last few weeks by the majority faction in the Majles. 
  In a harsh editorial published in the newspaper RESALAT on 
28 
Dey [18 January], Morteza Nabavi questioned the fundamental 
assumptions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget. He 
wrote: The nation's general revenues for the year 1373 were 
projected at R33,767 billion, and this was a 42.5-percent 
increase over the general revenues for the current year. In view 
of the sharp drop in oil prices for the current year and the 
failure to realize this year's revenues, the outlook for oil 
prices in the coming year is not bright or hopeful. The failure 
of OPEC members to agree to reduce the production ceiling, 
increased oil production in the North Sea, and reduced oil 
extraction costs for non-OPEC nations, create an uncertain 
future for oil prices. 
  In view of the above elements, Morteza Nabavi concludes that 
the price of oil in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
will be less than $10 billion. 
<H5>  Note 25 </H5>
  The second controversial point is Note 25 in the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Bill. If approved in 
the form proposed by the government, there would be increases of 
100 to 140 percent in the prices of some oil products. Economic 
circles in the IRI say that keeping prices low on oil products, 
which is really paying major subsidies on these products, cost 
the country about $10 billion in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994]. In reality, the very heavy consumption of oil 
products in the country is caused by their very low prices, 
which in some cases have remained unchanged since after the 
revolution. For example, the price of a liter of gasoline in 
Iran is equivalent to 15 centimes in France, meaning 
one-fortieth of its price in France! This situation causes 
Iran's oil products to be smuggled to neighboring countries, 
especially Turkey, where the price of gasoline is 20 times the 
price in Iran. 
  Concerning Note 25 and its consequences for Iran's economy 
there are two different views in the Islamic Republic's economic 
circles. One group says that with the increase in the price of 
oil products, people will not be wasteful and consequently the 
government can export some of what would be consumed 
domestically and increase its foreign exchange revenues. On the 
other side, opponents of Note 25 say that Iran's ability to 
export oil cannot be increased that much and that it would be 
difficult for the government to increase oil exports by 
decreasing domestic consumption. In this case, the only effect 
of increasing the price of oil products would be an explosive 
growth in inflation, while the effect on the nation's foreign 
exchange revenues would be insignificant. 
  The Majles finally approved Note 25, but it did not accept 
the increase in price for oil and gas products expected by 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. With 118 votes in favor, 92 votes in 
opposition, and 2 abstentions, the Majles rejected a proposal to 
reject all of Note 25, and authorized the government in 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] to increase the average price of a 
cubic meter of gas to R12.4, and to increase the price of a 
liter of the four oil products to the following maximum amounts: 
R80 for gasoline, R20 for kerosene, R10 for furnace oil, and R15 
for gasoil, and the difference between the prices set and the 
prices for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] would be deposited 
into the nation's general revenue account as oil and gas product 
taxes. 
<H5>  Foreign Debts </H5>
  The third issue, which has brought on a great struggle 
between the government and the Majles deputies, is the repayment 
of Iran's foreign debt. In its proposed budget for 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] the government assumes that $1 billion 
of the nation's oil revenues will be used to reduce the level of 
foreign commitments. The majority faction in the Majles 
considers this figure insignificant in view of the volume of the 
nation's debt, and it believes that a schedule for repaying 
these debts is the first and most important issue, which must be 
clarified before any decision is made about the 1373 budget. 
  Ever since studying the budget bill (9 Bahman [29 January]), 
Mahmud Astaneh, deputy from Sarband-e Araq, as the first 
opponent of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, 
gave vigorous emphasis to the government's foreign debt. He 
said: It is entirely regrettable that in the year 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994] we were faced with $10 billion in unpaid 
debt, and in the worst form, meaning several thousand small 
debts to different countries, and this shows lack of management 
on the part of the nation's economic experts. Yet in the year 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] we will incur roughly an 
additional $6 billion in debts. 
  The speaker accused the Central Bank of illegally using 
government assets and said: Under Note 29 of the 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994] budget bill, the Central Bank was required 
to act in such a way that the amount of commitments at the end 
of the year [20 March 1994] would be 15.72 percent less than it 
was at the beginning of the year [21 March 1993]. However, it 
was observed how the chief of the Central Bank's performance and 
economic revolution amounted to an auction of the dollars 
obtained through the sale of national capital.... 
  The deputy from Sarband-e Araq also added: One of the most 
important issues with which the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget must deal is setting up a schedule for the 
repayment of foreign debt, and yet in its proposed budget the 
government is asking authorization for taking on another $5.4 
billion in foreign exchange commitments. 
<H5>  'Adeli's Return </H5>
  On the other hand, Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli, whose position as 
president seems to be solidified, has again returned to the 
public eye, and in an interview with the English-language 
newspaper TEHRAN TIMES, published on 28 Dey [18 January], he 
claimed that "the government or the Central Bank do not owe a 
cent to any country or company. Rather, it is the private 
companies and Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt, and 
even these debts are not fixed and they change over time." 
  The chief of the Central Bank said Iran's total outstanding 
debt is $8 billion, and he attributed that to the failure of 
insurance agencies to grant coverage to Iran's mid-term and 
long-term credits. 
  In response to 'Adeli's remarks, the newspaper SALAM, in its 
"Notes" published Sunday 3 Bahman [23 January], wrote: Really, 
if someone said such a thing who had no knowledge of the science 
of economics or banking affairs it would not be surprising, but 
when the Central Bank chief says such a thing, it is very 
surprising. We do not know whether the central banks chiefs in 
other countries can say such things or not, and if they do, can 
they still continue working at their jobs? 
  Does he expect foreign insurance companies to pay for the 
Central Bank's failure to manage its foreign repayments? It is 
truly interesting that he says Iran does not owe a cent to any 
country or company, but that it is these private companies and 
Iran's commercial banks who have foreign debt. We ask him, from 
what bank have Iranian citizens gotten credit certification for 
their import purchases? Did they not give rial amounts 
equivalent to the foreign exchange to the Central Bank and other 
banks, and did they not establish credit certification for the 
purchases? In reality, before making any kind of purchase, 
Iranian citizens give the equivalent amount in rials to the 
banks and after that it is these banks who deal with the foreign 
companies, and no Iranian citizen is in debt for this credit, it 
is the banks who are in debt and we all know that the banks in 
Iran are government banks. That is, it is the Government of Iran 
that is in debt, and nothing is changed by saying such things.

  [Text] The newspaper HAMSHAHRI, published daily with a 
circulation of 200,000, is undoubtedly one of Iran's most 
successful newspapers. The secret of this success is not just 
that this newspaper is full of content and variety and sells at 
half the price--5 tomans--of the rest of Tehran's newspapers. 
Nor is its success due only to the fact that it has a 
professional and experienced staff. Sociologists and media 
experts emphasize two other factors in this regard: One is the 
fact that it is very appealing as a four-color newspaper with a 
more attractive and orderly layout in a land where the 
revolution has eliminated all colors other than black and white. 
The other factor is that HAMSHAHRI is basically a "nonpolitical" 
newspaper, in the sense that in reading and looking at it one 
concludes that it does not insist on showing itself as a staunch 
defender of the government and the revolution. 
  Informed observers say HAMSHAHRI has chosen all these 
methods 
and procedures according to a calculated plan. Whatever the 
truth may be, it is clear that two newspapers, one of them 
KEYHAN of Tehran and the other the heavyweight JOMHURI-YE 
ESLAMI, make most of their attacks against HAMSHAHRI, with such 
things as their criticism of the mayor for spending the "public 
treasury" to publish a newspaper to make propaganda for himself. 
  Despite all this, no one knows whether this newspaper has 
revenues and income or whether it really gets help from the 
municipal government. If the opponents of the mayor and the 
monthly HAMSHAHRI could do so, they would stop its publication, 
but it seems that their power has not yet reached the newspaper, 
even though one of the regime's most powerful clerics, Ayatollah 
Khaz'ali, has said concerning the mayor that he is one step away 
from a religious decree that he should be killed.

  [Text] KEYHAN Economic Service -- Based on the latest 
reports received from Tehran, following the serious disruption 
of the economic situation in the Islamic Republic and the 
intensification of the political disorder, there has been a 
striking increase in the illegal flight of capital from Iran. 
Sources close to international financial organizations who 
follow changes in Iran have confirmed these reports. They say 
the relatively old phenomenon of capital fleeing from this 
country has taken on unprecedented proportions in recent months. 
  At the European headquarters of the World Bank in Paris, a 
high-ranking official who did not want to be identified told 
KEYHAN (published in London) that according to the latest 
assessment by this organization, in the year 1993 about $8 
billion in capital left Iran in various forms. The same official 
disclosed that World Bank delegates recently submitted the 
results of their assessment of this matter in Tehran. Six 
members of the World Bank met with Morteza Mohammad-Khani, 
minister of economic and financial affairs. This meeting was 
attended by Daniel [?Pupay], director of World Bank cooperation 
with Morocco and Iran. 
<H5>  Why The Flight of Capital? </H5>
  So far spokesmen for the Islamic Republic government have 
treated the flight of capital as a normal phenomenon and have 
attributed its increase in the years since the revolution to the 
ill will of those affiliated with the monarchy regime and to the 
consequences of the war. In its issue of 17 Mehr 1372 [9 October 
1993], the newspaper RESALAT wrote: Based on the estimates that 
were made, the volume of capital leaving Iran between the years 
1352 [21 March 1973- 20 March 1974] and 1365 [21 March 1986-20 
March 1987] was more than $27 billion, or about $2 billion per 
year. The peak was in the years 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 
1979] to 1359 [21 March 1980-20 March 1981], when agents and 
affiliates of the former regime played the basic role. 
  However, the end of the war and the beginning of 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's policy of "reform" was only able to halt 
temporarily the massive flight of capital from Iran. This halt 
ended months ago and has resumed at a more rapid rate with the 
weakened position of those who supported "economic adjustment" 
and the terror of the economic crisis. In the view of foreign 
and domestic experts, the expedited flight of capital is caused 
by four factors, the decline in value of the rial, increased 
insecurity for investors, disorder in economic policy making, 
and Iran's increased foreign debt. 
  1. The drop in value of the rial: Heightening inflation and 
the irresistible erosion of the value of Iran's national 
currency against international currencies is one of the main 
reasons for the flight of capital. In view of the nation's empty 
foreign exchange stocks, the drop in the price of oil, factory 
shutdowns and the unprecedented increase in the demand for 
foreign exchange, Iranian public opinion is convinced that the 
price of the dollar on the free market, which is already 
hovering around 212 tomans, will not remain at its current level 
and that the rial will continue to fall (late in the week a 
report was received that the price of the dollar on the Tehran 
foreign exchange market reached 219 tomans). The long-term 
outlook for Iran's national currency is especially dark in view 
of the fact that all the Islamic Republic's experts expect a 
significant increase in the inflation rate in the coming months. 
'Ali Taqi-Khamushi, deputy from Tehran and chief of the Iran 
Chamber of Commerce and Industries, recently discussed the 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. He said: 
Unfortunately, this budget includes inflation of 50 to 60 
percent. 
  2. Increased insecurity for investors: They have compared 
capital to a bird that lands only in a secure environment and 
flees as soon as it senses danger. Since the time of the 
revolution of 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979], the Islamic 
Republic has never been able to encourage Iran's capital to 
participate actively in the task of the nation's economic 
reconstruction. In the insecure atmosphere the vice-regency of 
the chief jurisconsult has created in Iran, capital has been 
either going into short-term profitable activities such as 
brokering and speculating, or it has been going to foreign 
countries at any price. 
  3. Disorder in economic policymaking: The lack of any kind 
of 
specific economic policy, the war between factions over 
directions for development and continuous changes in choices 
have made investors despair concerning the future and persuaded 
them either to leave their capital inactive or send it out of 
the country. In the last year, following the paralysis of the 
nation's economic leadership apparatus and the crisis in the 
policy of "economic adjustment," there has been a vast wave of 
confusion in Iran's economic and financial circles and 
confidence in the future has been severely shaken. 
  4. Increased foreign debt: The experience of Third World 
debtor nations, especially in Latin America, shows that there is 
a close relationship between increased foreign debt on the one 
hand and the rapid flight of capital on the other unless the 
indebtedness can be used in the framework of a specific and 
constructive economic strategy to strengthen industrial 
foundations. Iran's foreign debt, as we know, is one of the 
worst kinds of debt a country can have, because it has been used 
to import consumer goods. Moreover, because of its nature 
(taking the form of usance), it comes at very high interest. 
Increased foreign debt in a country like Iran is indicative of 
even greater instability in its political and economic positions 
and for this reason has made the atmosphere even more insecure 
for investors, and it increases the illegal flight of capital. 
<H5>  Consequences of Capital Flight </H5>
  Iranian capital makes its way abroad in various ways: In the 
form of cash in the transfer of foreign exchange, through 
manipulation in the prices of export or import goods, and other 
means. For example, exporters can show the amount of foreign 
exchange earned from their exports to be less than it is and 
they can keep the difference between the real foreign exchange 
and the amount declared abroad. Likewise, importers may 
negotiate with foreign companies to show the foreign exchange 
needed to be greater than it actually is and keep the difference 
abroad. 
  The flight of capital, in whatever form it takes, is very 
costly to Iran's economy. The consequences can be summarized as 
follows: 

  -  A significant portion of the nation's domestic savings is 
transferred abroad instead of being used in economic 
circuits. 
  -  The portion of incomes subject to taxes is reduced, 
and since the government's revenues also decreases, a 
significant share of the tax burden falls on the weak 
classes. 
  -  It increases the demand for foreign exchange and for 
this reason the fall of the rial against foreign currencies is 
precipitated. 
  -  It decreases the resources needed for domestic 
investment and drives the country to borrowing on the 
international financial markets, thereby increasing the nation's 
foreign debt. 
  Economic experts say the only way to combat the flight of 
capital is to create a secure atmosphere, restore the overall 
economy to soundness and put producing units into operation. 
Legal restraints in this regard are not that effective. 
<H5>  The Search for Capital </H5>
  The flight of $8 billion in capital in one year is taking 
place at a time when Iran is faced with an unprecedented drop in 
foreign exchange. On Tuesday 12 Bahman [1 January] Hasan 
Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, said in the province of 
Semnan that due to the drop in the price of oil Iran has 
suffered a $4 billion revenue loss in the year 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994]. He added that during the First Five-Year 
Plan Iran lost $6.4 billion in foreign exchange due to 
fluctuations in the price of the dollar against other 
currencies. Rowhani said: We sell oil in dollars, but our 
purchases are recognized in pounds, yens, marks, and other 
currencies. 
  The foreign exchange shortage has halted many of the Islamic 
Republic's development programs. Even development projects in 
the nation's oil regions in the Persian Gulf have stopped. The 
newspaper SALAM's correspondent in the oil regions of the 
Persian Gulf reports that the development projects in the 
nation's oil regions in these areas have been stopped by the 
government because of the failure to allocate sufficient 
credits, and Iran's shared gas reserves are being drained by 
nations in the Persian Gulf. 
  On Sunday 11 Bahman [31 December] Engineer 'Abbas Vakil, 
chief of the Lavan oil district, said: Due to the failure to 
allocate credits and to make suitable investments to develop the 
Dalan-Kangan (Khuf) gas field that is shared by Iran and Abu 
Dhabi, this project has stopped. There is no gas exploitation or 
development being done by Iran, and the Abu Dhabi government is 
using advanced techniques to produce and extract the shared gas 
from this field. 
  Engineer 'Abbas Vakil emphasized the need for Iran to invest 
in activity and exploitation in this gas field. He said: The 
Khuf gas field has been in use by the government of Abu Dhabi 
for three to four years. The Khuf gas field is in the lower 
layer of the Mosalman gas field, 150 km from Lavan Island. 
  The severe shortage of foreign exchange and the halting of 
many development projects has persuaded the Islamic Republic's 
officials again to seek foreign investment. Morteza Mohammad 
Khan, the Islamic Republic's minister of economic and financial 
affairs, recently met with Rafi' al-Din Ahmad, executive 
secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the 
Pacific (ESCAP) and told him: "Economic and legal conditions are 
favorable in Iran for attracting and supporting foreign 
investment." 
  Mohammad Khan is inviting foreigners to invest in the 
Islamic 
Republic at a time when the uproar of opposition to Coca-ola has 
provoked very negative reactions outside Iran. Recently Mohsen 
Rafiqdust, supervisor of the Foundation for War Veterans and the 
Oppressed, said: We will remove the American Coca-ola company 
from Iran. 
  In its 5 Bahman article [25 December], writing in this same 
vein, the newspaper SALAM published an article quoting one of 
its readers: The question that comes to my mind is, this company 
(Coca-ola) has invested and started a factory with lawful 
authorization, and all the public officials have witnessed its 
activities and advertising. Now why all of a sudden is there all 
this commotion about removing it? 
  A reader of SALAM--or perhaps the newspaper's editorial 
board 
preferred to have this said in the words of a "reader"--wrote in 
answer to the above question: "Zarifi said that this company, 
associated with world-devouring America, has created problems in 
the field of competition for domestic producers affiliated with 
the Foundation for the Oppressed and War Veterans. Therefore, 
the chief of this foundation's very serious opposition is not 
without its points!" Of course, to obtain his reward in the 
hereafter, it is useful for him to invoke the war against the 
cultural invasion. 
  In any case, this measure by Mr.Mohsen Rafiqdust shows to 
what extent the public atmosphere in Iran is ready to protect 
Iranian investments and to attract foreign investments.

  [Text] KEYHAN Economic Service -- The Islamic Republic of 
Iran is trying to find a way to deal with its foreign exchange 
commitments and get out of its foreign-debt bind by sharply 
cutting imports. This measure, which has created one of the most 
severe fluctuations in the history of Iran's foreign trade, has 
not just affected the import of consumer goods, it has also 
created daily increasing problems for industrial units in 
meeting their import needs, and in some areas it even threatens 
to stop the production cycle. 
  Economic experts in the Iranian capital say cutting exports 
alone will not solve Iran's foreign debt problems, and that 
hasty measures taken for public display in this area will only 
lead to greater disruption of Iran's productive ability. 
<H5>  From $29 Billion to $12 Billion? </H5>
  Based on the predictions of some Iranian and foreign 
sources, 
the volume of Iran's imports will drop from $29 billion in the 
year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] to about $12 billion in 
the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. If this occurs, 
Iran's imports will drop 58 percent in 12 months. It is said 
that this year only America was unable to increase its exports 
to Iran. 
  Concerning the amount of Iran's imports in the year 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993], the figure of $29 billion is based on 
a statistic published late in the month of Azar [22 November-21 
December] by the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Office of 
Statistics and Machine Services. In its report, the Customs 
Office emphasized that this volume of imports includes political 
exemptions, foreign goods in transit, goods accompanying 
travelers, and smuggled goods, and if these goods are counted, 
imports for the year 1371 will be more than $29 billion. The 
largest amount of goods in terms of value in the year 1371 came 
into the country from Germany, Japan, and Italy. 
  Reports published recently by foreign sources show that 
there 
was a significant drop in the exports from the above three 
countries to Iran. Based on the latest statistics published by 
the Japanese Foreign Trade Organization, in the first nine 
months of the year 1993 (winter through summer of last year) 
Iran imported about $1.2 billion from Japan, while the value of 
Iran's imports from Japan in the first nine months of 1992 was 
$2.1 billion. 
  The total volume of Germany's exports to Iran in 1993 
decreased about 40 percent, but no reliable reports in this 
regard have yet been received. In Italy, hundreds of small- and 
medium-sized companies active in the Iranian market are on the 
verge of bankruptcy because of the sharp drop in exports to the 
Islamic Republic and hundreds of their workers are faced with 
unemployment. This situation has developed as the result of 
Iran's new import policy, and it has also caused insurance 
guaranteeing exports to Iran to be cut by the Italian Export 
Credit Insurance Agency, known as Sace. Sace, following the lead 
of its Western counterparts such as COFACE [Foreign 
Trade-Insurance Credit Company] in France and Hermes [export 
credit guaranteee agency] in Germany, is refusing to issue 
insurance coverage on exports by Italian companies to Iran. A 
group of Italian parliamentary deputies, in asking a question of 
the government of that country, warned of the unemployment of 
those hundreds of workers. They said: "What Sace did with 
exports to Iran has caused heavy losses for Italian companies, 
because those companies, after signing contracts with their 
counterparts in Iran, have stopped production because of Sace's 
failure to make a quick decision and they have stopped exports 
to Iran." The measure taken by Sace followed the intensification 
of the frightening financial conditions in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and this country's inability to meet its foreign 
commitments. 
<H5>  Highest Rate of Debt Growth </H5>
  Iran's financial crisis mainly came about in the wake of the 
disruption of its trade balance, meaning the dominance of 
imports over exports. The nation's trade deficit went from $7 
billion in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] to $10 billion in 
1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. The result was that Iran's 
foreign debt reached astronomical levels, rising to about $30 
billion (or, according to some Iranian sources, including the 
newspaper SALAM, to about $40 billion). In its recent report on 
world debt published as World Debt Tables, the World Bank said 
Iran had the highest rate of debt growth among the Middle 
Eastern and North African nations. This report, which is 
published annually, shows the latest short-term and long-term 
debt situation for all nations. 
  This report says Iran's foreign debt increased from $11.3 
billion in 1991 to $14.2 billion at the end of 1992, amounting 
to about 13 percent of the value of Iran's gross domestic 
product [GDP]. This figure was about 10 percent at the end of 
the year 1991. The aforementioned report also says that in the 
year 1992, 78 percent of Iran's foreign debt was short-term 
debt. The World Bank concludes that Iran's rate of acquiring 
debt is the highest among the nations of the Middle East and 
North Africa. 
  Can the policy of sharply reducing imports put an end to 
Iran's foreign debt crisis? Apparently the repayment of debt, 
which is mostly short term and at high interest rates, is a 
priority for Iran's economic policymakers. However, there is 
much evidence that this crisis cannot be solved by reducing 
imports alone. 
  First of all, even if the Islamic Republic could reduce 
imports to $13 billion by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], it 
would only succeed in leveling the nation's trade balance, 
because the nation's exports, with a best-case assessment of the 
current state of the oil market, even including nonoil products, 
will not go higher than $14 billion. This amount of foreign 
exchange will barely suffice to meet the need for subsidized 
goods, the Ministry of Petroelum's equipment and services, 
military equipment and interest on loans, and then there will 
nothing left to pay the principal on loans. 
  Moreover, foreign trade problems must not be assessed solely 
in light of the balance between imports and exports. Many of 
Iran's producing units are dependent on imported capital and 
intermediate goods, and suddenly depriving them of these goods 
could lead to their absolute destruction and the unemployment of 
hundreds of thousands of workers. 
  In this same regard Dr. Akbar Karbasian wrote in the 5 Dey 
[26 December] issue of RESALAT that the decisions of the Foreign 
Exchange Market Regulating Commission have exposed private 
companies to "the long and wide bureaucracy of the Ministry of 
Commerce. While they have to register their orders with that 
ministry (and not at the Central Bank), they are wandering 
between the Ministry of Commerce, the Central Bank and Iran 
Customs. What is not clear is, if there is a foreign exchange 
shortage, what are the nation's many producers, their personnel 
and their families going to do?" 
  Akbar Karbasian adds that even if the Foreign Exchange 
Regulating Committee's policymakers "can in the short term 
inject some calm into the nation's economic structure, which is 
now limping along, the long-term indicators such as the GDP, 
per-capita income, and new investment are on the decline." 
  To solve Iran's financial crisis, short-term and long-term 
measures are without a doubt more constructive than quick fixes 
for public consumption. Some Iranian experts say that to get out 
of the deadlock, the country should pay off its short-term debt 
as quickly as possible by getting new sources of foreign 
exchange on the international financial market in the form of 
long-term lower-interest loans. The only way to achieve this 
goal, however, is to hold a series of international talks, 
especially with the IMF and the World Bank. This will get the 
country out of its economic constraints, and it has to do with 
the Islamic Republic's foreign policy and its relations with the 
world community. 
<H5>  War Against `Economic Hypocrites' </H5>
  Despite the decisions by the Foreign Exchange Regulating 
Committee and the imposition of heavy pressure on imports, the 
future of the rial against the dollar remains quite uncertain. 
In this regard many rumors are circulating in the Islamic 
Republic's capital. Based on reports received from Tehran, some 
Central Bank experts are saying that based on the economic 
models they have that the price of the dollar will go to 280 
tomans and will find relative stability at this level. 
  The drop in value of Iran's national currency, which is 
caused by severe social disruption in the country, is currently 
one of the hottest economic debates in the Islamic Republic's 
press. In its 28 Azar [19 December] issue the newspaper 
JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI writes: "the problem of foreign exchange is 
more than an economic reality. It has now become an all-out war 
between the economic hypocrites and the government." This 
newspaper adds that the "economic hypocrites" paraded in the 
playing field for several days by taking over the Islambul [a 
Tehran street] intersection, just as the "political hypocrites" 
tried to destroy the Islamic Republic by taking over Islamabad. 
  With regard to the difference between "political hypocrites" 
and "economic hypocrites," the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI 
writes that the first group, "with its savage actions, showed 
more than before the oppressed condition of Islamic officials." 
Now the second group, "with its actions, is causing people to be 
disappointed with the government's officials, and with the 
rumors it is circulating among the people, it is saying that 
even the government's top officials are acting with it, and this 
is to disperse the people away from the Islamic government." 
  The same newspaper adds: "More regrettable is the influence 
of those who have positioned themselves here and there in 
government organizations as specialists and are making the 
analysis that our national currency should fall even further to 
reach real parity." 
  The experts the newspaper refers to are in the Central Bank. 
As was mentioned, they put the parity rate of the rial and the 
dollar at 280 tomans. 
<H5>  `Ruinous' Policies </H5>
  On the other hand, in its 24 Azar [3 November] issue the 
newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI published a very harshly worded 
editorial accusing Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government, without 
mentioning the president of the republic's name, of implementing 
"ruinous" economic policies. This newspaper wrote: The 
unjustifiable silence of the nation's economic officials has 
reached an intolerable point, and it is still unclear whether 
this silence is a specific policy or whether our economic 
officials really have nothing to say. 
  In its editorial, the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI adds: Even 
those who defend the policy of unifying the foreign exchange 
rate, even those who consider it necessary at this time to 
implement the policies of economic adjustment, and even those 
who approve of simultaneous implementation of all these 
programs, fully acknowledge the truth that there is no economic 
justification of any kind for the instantaneous jump in the 
foreign exchange rate. 
  This newspaper says "unbridled imports" are the main cause 
in 
the drop in the value of Iran's national currency. It wrote: 
Even if we did not have the self-sufficiency slogan, even if we 
did not think in revolutionary terms, even if we were not 
thinking about deprived people and the owners of this 
revolution, we should not tolerate such ruinous decisions and 
economic policies, which open the country's doors to imports of 
everything. Today we are like someone who has drained the water 
out of his pond and is wondering why the fish do not have any 
water. Today we are aligning our national currency with foreign 
currencies at a time when our national economic and banking 
system are not ready and do not have the capacity to make such a 
change. With the water drained out of the pool, we still want to 
see the fish living and in the water.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Salvation Front: Rabeh Kebir's </F>
Uncle Was Killed at a Security Roadblock"] 
  [Excerpt] Jeddah, Algiers, AFP, REUTER -- Sources close to 
the Islamic Salvation Front have said that uncle of Cheikh Rabeh 
Kebir, chairman of the Front's Executive Committee abroad, was 
killed last Monday morning "because of his identity" at a 
security roadblock in the al-Qall [as transliterated] area in 
east Algeria. 
  The sources revealed new details about the fighting that 
took 
place Monday morning in the al-Qall area near the village of 
Kanoua'. An eyewitness who smuggled his report out of the 
country says that before dawn on Monday a military group entered 
the al-Tars [as transliterated] area near al-Qall and set up a 
roadblock, halting the traffic. Cheikh 'Ali Kebir (60) happened 
to by passing by with two other people in a truck driven by him. 
  The military group, the sources said, continued to move into 
the area, and at about 1030 hrs it was ambushed in an area 
called Mahafir al-Baghlah [as transliterated]. The ambush had 
been set up by gunmen belonging to the Armed Islamic Movement. 
  The sources added that the gunmen attacked the group with 
their automatic weapons, and that the elements manning the 
roadblock knew about the incidents, so they killed Kebir and his 
two companions. 
  Armed Islamist sources put the number of dead among the 
security forces at 500 [as published], among them three officers 
holding the rank of first lieutenant. 
  Furthermore, Front sources say that 'Ayn al-Na'jah military 
hospital in the capital is overstreched during the month of 
Ramadan, noting that the focus is on liquidating those 
collaborating with the authorities, who are described as 
informers by a report on military operations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the Algerian </F>
Islamic Society Movement (HAMAS), by 'Abdallah al-Hajj in 
Jeddah; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Hajj] It seems that the confrontation 
between the regime and the Islamists is escalating, despite 
Zeroual's appointment as president. What are the direct reasons 
for the escalation? 
  [Nahnah] We expected an escalation of violence because 
political rivalry is not based on rules that guarantee power 
rotation or participation in power so as to safeguard security 
and property and prevent bloodshed. The swelling of the tide of 
violence remains natural as long as some people are pursuing the 
policy of breaking bones and destroying the country, its present 
and future, even at the expense of values, virtues, and 
achievements. [passage omitted] 
  Liamine Zeroual's arrival is another experience to be added 
to the other experiences. However, what attracts attention is 
the fact that the man has the presidential and defense powers 
and does not need to hesitate as much as those before him did. 
This is why we saw him move toward dialogue and toward 
expanding it and securing mechanisms and a date for it -- which 
is indeed a glimmer of hope. But the armed party -- so it seems 
-- felt that the rug had been pulled from under its feet, so it 
decided to increase the tide of violence so as to attract 
attention to the claim that it is the party concerned with the 
dialogue of negotiation, not anyone else. Especially as the 
Islamic Salvation Front realized that the policy of 
confrontation would lead to the required outcome, so it 
displayed a degree of reason, which armed parties tend to 
ignore. These parties tend to threaten or criticize anyone who 
insists on adopting reason, which most regrettably came after 
the devastation of the country. Had the conflicting parties 
accepted dialogue from the first day, we would not have reached 
the verge of this painful devastation. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hajj] Hocine Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Socialist Forces 
Front, has said that a civil war will break out in Algeria and 
that the more extremist will win it. What is your opinion? 
  [Nahnah] Numerous hands are involved in the Algerian 
situation, because of the explosive issues which have found a 
good climate for explosion in the critical situation. Even 
before this crisis erupted, our movement warned about the 
serious situations which could develop in Algeria along the 
lines of what is happening in Lebanon, Afghanistan, or Somalia. 
Especially since some people are working to kindle the 
political, religious, and frontal sedition in Algeria. Anyone 
who says that the most extremist will win is actually openly 
calling for more extremism, which damages the image of Islam and 
political Islamist movements. Muslims rushed into many battles, 
but the sly reaped the fruits. The policy of decay pursued by 
the Algerian and foreign octopuses serves only the idea of 
settling scores at the expense of the nation and its constants. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hajj] Preacher Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani was 
assassinated recently. Do you believe that this will lead to 
inter-Islamic confrontations inside Algeria? 
  [Nahnah] Martyr Cheikh Mohamed Bouslimani, may God have 
mercy on him, was a man of knowledge, call [al-da'wah], and 
reform for 30 years. He was killed by the hands of treachery, 
sin, and recklessness. They have ignorantly assumed the task of 
shedding innocent blood directly or indirectly in order to 
exploit the critical situation. We cannot say that this action 
is the result of the understanding of Islam. Not at all. The 
Islamic banner is exploited to achieve cheap and base 
objectives, namely to spread terror, plant despair, expand the 
circle of frustration among citizens, and push the Algerians 
toward infighting and sever their necks and ruin their homes 
with their own hands. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Hajj] Do you believe that President Zeroual is the man 
of the hour in Algeria? And how can he succeed in salvaging the 
country? 
  [Nahnah] The country's success and extrication from the 
crisis cannot be achieved by putting diluted ointments on 
malignant tumors, but by abandoning deception, falsification, 
and the policy of playing for time, and turning to the people, 
respecting their will, and opening channels to express their 
ideas and proposals without any compulsion, domination, 
subservience, arrogance, or marginalization. 
  I welcome Liamine Zeroual's endeavor to ease the crisis by 
expanding the dialogue, alleviating the citizens' suffering, 
hastening to hold elections, and not taking any notice of the 
voices of the crows of socialism, secularism, and ignorance, who 
are the cause of the calamity and the bankruptcy. They promote 
French influence and Marxism. And I urge President Zeroual to 
shorten the transitional phase as much as possible. And if 
necessary, he should at least be a fair tyrant in this period.

  [Text] Cairo, March 4 (AFP)--Egypt's outlawed Islamic Group 
said Friday it had carried out three attacks in the past week to 
avenge the Hebron massacre of more than 50 Muslim worshipers by 
a Jewish settler. 
  The Islamic Group, known in Arabic as al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah, claimed responsibility for two attacks on banks 
and the murder of a police officer, according to a statement 
sent to AFP. 
  "These operations are part of the escalation we decided on 
to 
avenge the martyrs of Abraham Mosque" in Hebron, the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Jewish settler shot dead 52 
Palestinian worshippers last Friday, it said. 
  The statement claimed responsibility for the late Thursday 
explosion at the Egyptian-American Bank in Cairo, as well as an 
attack on Tuesday against Misr Bank in Abu Tij and the killing 
of a police officer in Badari. 
  Both Abu Tij and Badari are in the southern region of Asyut, 
a Muslim militant stronghold. 
  The group said it carried out the attacks after the banks 
closed "in order not to endanger human lives." 
  It renewed its February 8 call to tourists and foreign 
investors to leave Egypt and to Egyptian bank customers to close 
their accounts. "If these (attacks) are not enough for you, 
there will be others," it said. 
  Since the warning there have been six attacks against banks 
-- five in Cairo and one in Asyut -- but there have been no 
casualties.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Mar (MENA)--The opposition parties have 
strongly condemned the ugly crime the Israelis committed in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque on Friday last week in which scores of 
innocent Palestinians were martyred. 
  The statement, which was issued by the parties today during 
a 
news conference held at the headquarters of the Liberal Party, 
asked that the world conscience be addressed by sending cables 
of protest to the member countries of the Security Council to 
impose economic sanctions on Israel and force it to respect the 
Palestinians. 
  The statement asked the Islamic Conference Organization to 
convene an urgent conference in holy Mecca to discuss what the 
Muslims are being subjected to in Palestine and all other 
places, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina, and make practical 
decisions to protect the holy Muslim shrines, especially inside 
the al-Aqsa Mosque.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the Nasirite Arab Democratic Party] </F>
  [Text] The Nasirite Arab Democratic Party [NADP] strongly 
condemns the barbaric massacres and bestial actions perpetrated 
by the Zionist gangs against our Arab people in Palestine. 
These vile crimes eloquently demonstrate the extremely racist 
nature of the Zionist enemy, which is hostile to all that is 
humanitarian and good in this world, while it brags about 
peaceful solutions. 
  The Hebron massacre and the bloody confrontations that 
followed it in the occupied territories reaffirm our party's 
unwavering stand on the illusion of peace with the usurping 
enemy. They also represent further evidence of the principles 
that what has been taken by force can only be retrieved by force 
and that there is no final solution to the Palestinian issue 
other than the liberation of all its territories from Zionist 
desecration. Our party stresses that Zionists' ruses will not 
deceive the Arab people. There is nothing that can make us 
differentiate between the Zionist settlers' actions and the 
practices of the occupation gangs. All of them were involved in 
shedding Arab blood during the month of Ramadan in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque and in the steadfast towns of the West Bank and the Gaza 
Strip. It is logical for Rabin to attempt to depict the bloody 
massacre as an action of an irresponsible individual and to ask 
the Palestinians to exercise self-restraint and not stage 
provocative acts against him?! However, it is shameful for the 
Egyptian Foreign Ministry to issue a statement describing the 
bloody massacre as part of the extremist acts that are engulfing 
the world, as if it is the government's duty to look for excuses 
and justifications that absolve the Zionist gangs from the 
martyrs' blood. Still worse is the Egyptian Government's 
determination to continue to deceive the Arabs and tame them so 
as to accept the humiliating capitulation to the Zionist enemy. 
  These regrettable incidents have proved the weakness and 
naivete of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which places the 
Palestinian people firmly in the Zionist enemy's palm. They 
have destroyed for good all the illusions that have been 
propagated about living under the Zionist spears and among tense 
and racist settlements. It is a glaring idiocy for some Arab 
rulers to call on the Zionist enemy to protect the Palestinians 
in the occupied territories when the occupation forces protected 
the killers while they broke into the Ibrahimi Mosque and are 
still firing the bullets of treachery at the Arab demonstrators 
in every Palestinian village and town. 
  The time has come for the Arab rulers to wake up from their 
slumber, stop squandering the rights of the Arab people in 
Palestine, shake off their submissiveness to U.S.-Zionist 
orders, and voluntarily abandon--before being forced to do 
so--the suspicious propagation of plans of capitulating to 
Zionist ambitions. 
  Our party calls on the Arab masses to declare their anger, 
profess their solidarity with our kinsmen in the occupied 
territories through all available means, and fully condemn 
attempts to impose capitulation to Zionist ambitions. We call 
on the Arab masses to boycott all forms of normalization with 
the Zionist enemy. The NADP declares its full support for the 
Arab people's intifadah in Palestine, which is one of the 
noblest expressions of Arab rejection in an age of government 
subservience to Zionist arrogance.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Wafd Party on the al-Ibrahimi </F>
Mosque massacre--date not given] 
  [Text] Muslim society and the international community in 
general are heartbroken at the report of the massacre 
perpetrated by a fanatical Zionist inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in which dozens of Palestinians were martyred and hundreds 
others were injured, unarmed victims who were praying to God 
from their hearts during the dawn prayers. 
  This massacre is to be added to the crimes that the 
Palestinian people have been subjected to since the Dayr Yasin 
massacre, which was perpetrated by criminal thugs whose 
objective was to uproot the Palestinian people from their lands 
and possessions and to give these lands and possessions to 
tyrants and despots. And these despots went ahead with the 
judaization of the Palestinian land in accordance with a vile 
scheme that resulted in covering the Palestinian territories 
with settlements and colonies that are like a spearhead in the 
Arab nation's body. 
  The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre constitutes a crime against 
all humanity. It is the black fruit of the tendencies of hatred 
and bigotry that Zionism is planting in the hearts of its 
followers, thus prompting them to kill and practice violence and 
urging them to annihilate the Arabs so that the land will be 
theirs alone and Israel's area can expand to include the entire 
Middle East, with sovereignty over and control of all the 
peoples of the region. 
  The treacherous bullets that assassinated the worshippers in 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque wounded the hearts of the Arabs, Muslims 
and supporters of right and justice everywhere. These bullets 
have undermined the peace hopes of everyone. Israel's rulers are 
secretly hatching plots while talking publicly about peace. They 
are the ones who gave the terrorrist an opportunity to attack 
the worshippers and it is they who cover up for the criminals 
after each massacre. 
  The Wafd Party, which firmly believes that justice must win 
and injustice is bound to be vanquished sooner or later, 
believes that this ugly crime must open the eyes of the Arab 
rulers to the extent of the Israeli danger. The Arab rulers 
must rise above differences, conflicts, and hatreds and stand 
united against the schemes being hatched against us so as to 
turn us into lackies of the Israeli state under the slogan of 
the Middle East policy. The Arab peoples should be aware of the 
danger coming from Israel and those who stand behind Israel. 
The Wafd Party, while feeling the enormity of the catastrophe 
inflicted on the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, 
is confident that this catastrophe will make this heroic people 
more determined, stronger, and more steadfast. The martyrs who 
were slain by the bullets of treachery are in an Assembly of 
Truth, in the Presence of a Sovereign Omnipotent, in the company 
of prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of truth), the 
witnesses (who testify), and the righteous (who do good): Ah! 
what a beautiful fellowship. [Koranic verse] 
  [Signed] Muhammad Fu'ad Siraj-al-Din 
  Wafd Party leader.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry's security forces have imposed 
strict security measures around the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, 
the Academic Center, and the Jewish cemetery in the city center. 
Security sources said that these measures were taken as a 
precaution against reactions to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
in Hebron. 
  The security sources also imposed strict security measures 
around the houses of the Israeli diplomatic mission members and 
put up barricades on all the roads leading to the embassy. 
Passersby were subjected to exhaustive searches. 
  AL-WAFD learned that Israeli Ambassador David Sultan has 
issued instructions to the Jewish and diplomatic community in 
Cairo advising them to be cautious in their movements. 
  A responsible source at the Interior Minister asserted that 
these are precautionary measures to prevent acts of revenge. 
  A state of alert was also announced at Cairo International 
Airport yesterday for fear of violent acts against Israeli 
delegations coming to or leaving Cairo. The airport authorities 
imposed strict security measures inside the passenger lounges 
and on the Israeli airline EL AL flights and with luggage checks.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Mar (MENA)--A huge peaceful march was 
staged in Cairo this evening by thousands of youths and women. 
The participants condemned the Israeli actions in the occupied 
territories and the bestial massacre of innocent Palestinians in 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Thousands of worshippers came 
out of the 'Amr-Ibn-al-'Ass Mosque after evening prayers and 
joined the march, which proceeded to the al-Rawdah and al-Manyal 
areas chanting slogans and carrying placards condemning that 
abominable crime. Police vehicles escorted the peaceful march to 
protect it.

  [Text] Cairo, 3 Mar (MENA)--Hundreds of university students 
assembled in al-Tahrir Square this afternoon carrying placards 
condemning the ugly massacre inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron last Friday [25 February]. 
  The students denounced this painful incident and demanded a 
halt to the peace negotiations with Israel. 
  After one hour of slogan shouting, when the square became 
overcrowded with other citizens, the police dispersed the 
demonstrators in order to prevent other elements infiltrating 
them and to keep traffic moving as it had begun to be disrupted. 
The police used tear gas and some warning shots to disperse the 
demonstrators.

  [Text] The security forces yesterday evening arrested six 
students from among hundreds of students who marched from Cairo 
University, crossed the University overpass to al-Qasr al-'Ayni 
Street and proceeded to the People's Assembly building to demand 
the abrogation of the peace treaty with Israel. The security 
forces intercepted the demonstration in front of the ROSE 
AL-YUSUF building and succeeded in dispersing it. These forces 
imposed strict security measures around the People's Assembly 
and the adjacent ministries for fear of a resumption of the 
demonstrations. 
  The Central Security Forces surrounded Cairo University and 
engaged in violent clashes with the students inside the campus 
and fired tear gas grenades and rubber bullets, injuring a large 
number of students. Among those injured were Hasan 
'Abd-al-Samad 'Asakir, a student at the law college; Sami 
Muhammad Zaydan, a student at the arts college; Mu'tazz Mahmud, 
a student at the law college, who was hit by three bullets in 
his left foot; and Sami Ahmad Fadil, whose left leg was hit by 
rubber bullets. A number of injured students were taken to the 
al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital. In the meantime, thousands of 
students continue to stage demonstrations in the universities of 
'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Alexandria. Nasirist and Islamic 
students joined in leading the demonstrations. The students 
carried placards condemning the Arab rulers' defeatist stances 
and calling for an immediate halt to the peace negotiations and 
the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in Cairo.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Mar (MENA)--Today's Cairo newspapers 
continue to comment on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, 
which killed 90 and wounded 300. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH advises the Arab negotiator to rearrange his 
cards, priorities, and stances, noting that there is no time for 
sorrow or he will lose his mind. 
  The paper adds that the Palestinian negotiator must benefit 
from conditions around him and from the repercussions of events 
in the occupied territories, where the Palestinian people are 
enduring a great historic ordeal. 
  The paper writes that the massacre proved to the world that 
the Israeli expansionist settlements constitute a security 
threat to the Palestinian people, a threat that should be 
eliminated. The massacre also showed the world that the 
continuing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories 
will mean unceasing massacres day and night, since 
confrontations between the Israeli army and the unarmed people 
do not stop. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds that the world has discovered that peace 
is indivisible; it either involves all the parties or none. The 
world has also discovered that negotiations will remain the only 
approach to a balanced peace. 
  AL-AKHBAR regrets that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre finds 
someone at the UN Security Council to protect the culprits and 
try to obstruct any resolution that condemns Israel and demands 
serious protection for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories to avoid a recurrence of the barbaric massacre. 
  The paper is surprised that the world, which condemned the 
massacre, is turning a blind eye to the massacres occurring 
daily in the West Bank and Gaza for years. It notes that Israel 
has given its soldiers the freedom to practice the hobby of 
hunting children and women with their automatic rifles. It 
wonders about the difference between the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and the massacres that have continued since the 
intifadah started in the occupied territories. True, the Hebron 
massacre was committed by a deranged Israeli officer, as they 
say, and finished off by the Israeli army to avert any 
Palestinian reaction. But the unceasing daily massacres against 
the Palestinian people lead to the same result of shedding and 
depleting Arab blood, the paper says. 
  AL-AKHBAR adds: If the members of the Israeli Government are 
truly sincere in their sorrow over the victims of the massacre, 
they would have prevented their soldiers from committing daily 
massacres in the occupied territories. 
  AL-AHRAM contends that the limited, cosmetic measures taken 
by Israel will not absorb the Arab, Islamic, and world rage over 
the horrific massacre that occurred in the Ibrahimi Mosque at 
dawn last Friday. 
  The paper believes that the world needs to know whether 
Israel really wants peace with the Arabs and Palestinians or 
merely wants to wear the mask of peace and pursue the policy of 
hegemony behind it. 
  AL-AHRAM says the logic of peace is clear and its course is 
straightforward. This makes it incumbent on Israel to adopt 
actual measures, pledge to disarm settlers, ban the activity of 
extremist Jewish organizations, and dismantle the Qiryat Arba' 
settlement, from which the Jewish butcher who committed the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre came, it stresses. 
  The paper concludes by saying that real peace begins by 
truly 
believing in a mutual and equal security, not by believing in 
one side's security at the expense of the others' lives.

  [Excerpt] Mustafah al-Badawayhi, head of the Damietta 
prosecution office, has ordered that the mayor of Damietta, a 
member of the city council, and 15 other extremists be put in 
prison for 15 days pending investigations. They were charged 
with forming a secret organization with the objective of 
toppling the government by using the position of the mayor 
supported by a number of other members of the council who belong 
to the Labor Party to conduct secret activities and to use the 
summer resort of Ra's al-Barr, which is now empty, for their 
organization's training, lectures, and other instruction. 
  The security men noticed some suspect activities by some 
youths known for their extremist tendencies. By observing them, 
it became evident that they were forming a secret organization 
and that the mayor was abusing his office to support the 
organization. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by al-Sa'id al-Shatti from Damietta] </F>
  [Text] Security Department interrogations of the members of 
the terrorist organization led by Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, 
ophthalmologist and chairman of the Damietta City Council, have 
revealed the existence of similar groups in many other 
governorates. These groups rely principally on the members of 
local councils affiliated with the Socialist Labor Party [SLP]. 
Some of the suspects have confessed, implicating their 
colleagues in other governorates. 
  The security departments will soon announce that they have 
uncovered new terrorist organizations in several governorates. 
  Dr. 'Ali al-Day said that as chairman of the City Council, 
he 
approved a Ramadan soccer tournament in the Ra's al-Barr sea 
resort at the request of Mustafa Subayhah, chairman of the City 
Council's Youth and Sports Committee. He denied that the team 
members were trained in karate or kung fu. 
  Investigations have shown that the chairman of the City 
Council, assisted by several SLP members, exploited the council 
and his own position to implement suspect plans and disseminate 
ideas calling for the regime's overthrow. 
  The suspects are: Dr. 'Ali Hasan al-Day, ophthalmologist and 
chairman of the City Council; Ashraf Zakariya 'Ubayd, deputy 
City Council chairman and decorator; Muhammad Muhammad al-Jundi, 
furniture dealer; Hasan al-Sayyid al-Mursi, optician; 
'Abd-al-Hadi al-Nahhas, freelance accountant; Hamdi 'Isa, 
agronomist; Husayn Husayn 'Ukashah, freelance accountant; 
al-Sa'id Muhammad Musa, decorator; Ahmad Gharib Abu-Diyal, 
vocational school student; Karim 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 
Jamal 'Abduh Shamsu, furniture maker; 'Adduh 'Ali Abu-Mahdi, 
carpenter; decorators Khamis Ibrahim and Muhammad Ibrahim; and 
furniture makers Ashraf Muhammad Basha, 'Abduh Abu-al-'Aynayn, 
and Mahmud al-Bih. 
  Mustafa al-Badawayhi, director of Damietta's Prosecution 
Office, remanded them for 15 days for interrogation on a charge 
of establishing an organization seeking to overthrow the 
government. 
  He also instructed that Damietta Public Attorney Counselor 
Ahmad al-'Izabi to supervise the arrest of the following eight 
further suspects: Mustafa Subayhah, City Council member; Wa'il 
Subayhah, secondary school student; Salamah al-'Iraqi; City 
Council member and furniture dealer; Salamah al-Bahawan, 
agronomist and City Council member; Muhammad Isma'il al-Rawdi, 
employee; Mahmud al-Sha'rawi, furniture maker; Ibrahim Durrah, 
decorator; and Ahmad Jaddu, decorator.

  [Excerpt] Damietta--The state security intelligence service 
in Damietta has uncovered a dangerous terrorist organization 
inside Tanta Prison led by Mahmud Muhammad Shu'ayb, brother in 
law of terrorist Karam Zuhdi. Both of them were sentenced for 
the 1981 events and the assassination of the late President 
Anwar al-Sadat. 
  Organization leader Shu'ayb is doing a life sentence in 
Tanta 
Prison after being convicted of involvement in the 1981 events 
and 40 terrorist acts in Asyut. Last March he began to contact 
a group of his colleagues and other elements from inside the 
prison in order to form an organization to be tasked with 
assassinating a number of public figures, with special emphasis 
on police officers and men. Ramadan Hasan Salih, Muntasir Ahmad 
Husayn, and Khalid Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Rahman, all of them from 
Asyut, helped him to set up the organization together with 
Mahmud Mustafa Hasaballah from al-Buhayrah, who is a doctor at 
the general hospital in Fuwah. 
  The intelligence service discovered all the arrangements 
made 
by the terrorist organization and monitored the instructions 
sent from the prison to the various members in a number of 
governorates. All the arrested defendants were handed over to 
the public prosecution office for interrogation. [passage

Hisham Fu'ad] 
  [Excerpt] AL-'ARABI has learned that two of those charged 
with attempting to assassinate President Mubarak by bombing Sidi 
Barrani airport and the presidential guest house in Marsa Matruh 
were executed by a firing squad Monday. The families of the two 
were notified to receive the bodies last Thursday. On 17 
February, the military court sentenced to death three people: 
Midhat al-Tahhawi, Hamadah Lutfi, and Muhammad Ahmad Sa'id 
Salih (fugitive). The court also sentenced Fathi Muhammad 
Khattab, Khalid Faraj, and Khalid Rashad to 10 years in prison. 
  Observers have noted that the indictment and trial were 
carried out quickly, with the whole case taking no more than one 
month. It all began when security services, in an inspection 
campaign in Abu Za'bal in mid-January, accidentally arrested one 
of the suspects. After that, the military prosecution prepared 
the indictment and the military court began its hearings on 30 
January. Three court sessions were held in 10 days, and 
families of the suspects were not allowed to contact their sons 
or appoint lawyers to defend them. The court appointed the 
defense lawyers. 
  Najar al-'Arabi, secretary of the Egyptian Human Rights 
Organization, commented on the military court ruling by saying: 
The trial was extremely hasty, and the defense could not 
perform its duty. The new executions only exacerbate the 
phenomenon of political executions; law organizations have 
repeatedly called for halting them and for the defendants to be 
allowed to appear before civilian judges. [passage omitted]

  The lawyer for the sixth defendant, 'Isam Muhammad

to verify the claim that they were assaulted. He said that he 
joins the other lawyers in demanding that the court disqualify 
all the testimonies attributed to the defendants. 
  Husayn Jabir Muhammad, the defense lawyer for the 11th 
defendant, Tuhami Ahmad 'Abdallah, called on the court to find 
his client not guilty for various reasons, including the 
invalidity of the arrest and search warrant because it was 
issued two hours after the accused were arrested and the 
invalidity of the testimonies and admissions attributed to him 
because they were taken under coercion. [passage omitted] 
  The court adjourned until tomorrow, when it will continue to 
hear the defense case.

  [Text] Tripoli, 4 Mar (MENA)--Colonel Mu'ammmar 
al-Qadhdhafi has praised Egypt's and President Husni Mubarak's 
role in seeking to solve the Libyan-Western dispute, noting that 
President Mubarak is currently making further efforts to achieve 
this result. He said Libya appreciates these efforts. 
  Col. al-Qadhdhafi also praised Egypt's role in confronting 
the challenges to the Arab world in a serious and responsible 
manner. He cited Egypt's efforts on behalf of the Palestinian 
cause as an example. 
  During a meeting with a delegation of Egyptian journalists 
who were attending the ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 
Libyan Jamahiriyah's establishment, al-Qadhdhafi said he 
maintains constant contact with President Mubarak. 
  Asked what Libya can offer to solve the Libyan-Western 
crisis, Col. al-Qadhdhafi said that Libya has nothing new to 
offer. 
  Regarding the disappearance of former Libyan Foreign 
Minister 
Mansur al-Kikhya, he said that Egypt and Libya are cooperating 
in an investigation to uncover the facts. 
  He declared: We are concerned about this issue. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi described al-Kikhya as "a Libyan citizen 
concerned with human rights, not an opposition figure." 
  Al-Qadhdhafi declared that no official Libyan decision has 
been made to withdraw from the Arab League, explaining that the 
union secretariat in Libya informed the Arab League of Libya's 
wish to withdraw in an informal manner. He explained that a 
draft resolution to withdraw from the League will be submitted 
to the Libyan basic people's congresses for discussion. He said 
Libya sees no benefit in staying in the league. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi called for amending the Arab League Charter to 
take into account world changes and their implications for the 
Arabs. He urged the league to develop itself. 
  Asked why he is not adopting inter-Arab reconciliation as a 
cause to defend and why he is not backing Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's initiative on this issue, 
al-Qadhdhafi said he agrees with Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's views and 
supports his efforts on this matter. He called for an Arab 
summit to revive inter-Arab solidarity. 
  Regarding his country's conflict with Chad, Col. 
al-Qadhdhafi 
said Libya is committed to the decision made by the 
International Court of Justice [ICJ] on this issue and that this 
dossier is now decisively closed. He noted, however, that some 
things needs to be arranged between the two countries so that 
the ICJ's ruling can be implemented. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi denounced the Arab world's terrorist movements, 
saying that they have no connection whatever with Islam and are 
financed and commanded by people abroad. He said Islam is 
innocent of these terrorist movements. 
  Col. al-Qadhdhafi denounced the massacre perpetrated by 
Israeli settlers in the Ibrahimi Mosque and said that the 
incident has moved all nations, including the United States. 
  He accused the Israeli Mosad of the recent bombing of a 
Coptic [as received] Church in Beirut, which he said was done to 
cover up the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libyan Opposition Once Again </F>
Highlights Plane Incident"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Libyan opposition has once 
again highlighted the incident of the crash of the Libyan plane 
which was flying from Benghazi to Tripoli in December 1992. 
  In a statement issued by Bashir al-Rabiti, head of the 
Libyan 
National Organization, the opposition held the Revolutionary 
Committees responsible for blowing up the plane with a view to 
killing three people who had important information about the 
Lockerbie explosion. 
  The statement quoted "eyewitnesses" as saying that elements 
from the Revolutionary Committees "arrived one hour before the 
plane took off from Baninah airport and issued stern orders to 
airport security officials not to search the elements that had 
entered the plane with three suitcases [haqa'ib] containing 
explosives." 
  The statement added that "the information available 
indicates 
that the three targeted people tried first to travel via the 
seaport of Benghazi but were prevented from doing so, and their 
movements were put under observation for fear of their releasing 
information about Lockerbie. Then it was decided to liquidate 
them." 
  The statement pointed out that Interior Minister Ibrahim 
al-Bakkar, who ordered the formation of a committee to 
investigate the explosion of the plane and begin its work after 
the Arab interior ministers' conference, met his death [laqiya 
hatfuh] while on his way back from the conference in Tunis.

<F P=106> [Report by Abdallah Oul Mohamedi: "Bloody Tribal Clashes </F>
Over Results of Mauritanian Municipal Elections"] 
  [Text] Nouakchott -- One person was killed and a number of 
others were wounded in bloody clashes between members of two 
tribes in the town of el 'Ayoun in eastern Mauritania because of 
a dispute over the results of the municipal elections. 
  According to travelers from the area, the clashes between 
the 
tribes spread throughout the entire town and the neighboring 
villages, necessitating the intervention of police units in the 
area to separate the combatants. Army reinforcements were also 
summoned to the area. Despite the scarcity of reports from the 
town yesterday morning, informed sources have told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that tribal leaders are threatening to take the battles 
to other areas. 
  According to the same sources, the clashes throughout the 
town broke out after the announcement of the results of the 
election of the chairman and deputy chairman of the town's 
Municipal Council. Two tribes competed for control of these 
posts. They are the Awlad el Nasir tribe, which supports the 
ruling party, and the el Aghlal tribe, which supports one of the 
opposition parties. The clashes began as soon as it was 
announced that the candidates of the ruling party had won. 
  Some Mauritanian officials accuse the authorities of 
encouraging tribal rivalry in the area by having the ruling 
party present a list of candidates controlled by a single tribe. 
That made the opposition play the same game by putting up a 
list of rival candidates also from a single tribe. The conflict 
in the area also assumed a religious dimension when a young man 
from a family that traditionally inherited religious leadership 
of the Hamawi sect appeared as a candidate on the opposition's 
list. According to a Mauritanian reporter who has been watching 
the situation there, "yesterday's events threaten a relentless 
war."

  [Summary From Poor Reception] "There is a split within the 
Union for Democracy and Progress [UDP], one of the leading 
opposition parties in Mauritania." A series of resignations 
have been noted, which is quite unfortunate. "From Mauritania, 
Salem Meshbour Salem reports:" 
  [Begin Salem recording] "The UDP represents the third 
political force in Mauritania, after Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed 
Taya's ruling Democratic and Social Republican Party and Ahmed 
Ould Daddah's Union of Democratic Forces, which is the leading 
opposition party. The UDP was established in June 1993 by Hamdi 
Ould Moukniess, a former foreign minister between 1960 to 1978 
under the First Republic." At the time he established the 
party, Moukniess, who was already very famous in his country, 
was joined by most of the former ministers of Mauritania's first 
president, Moctar Ould Dada, with the aim of initiating dialogue 
between the government and the opposition to resolve the serious 
problems confronting Mauritania. "Among these problems was 
national unity, since the fabric of the community had been 
seriously damaged in 1986, 1987, and especially 1989 during the 
incidents with Senegal. UDP leader Moukniess belongs to the 
first group of Mauritanian intellectuals, who rejected the 
falsification of the cultural identity of the various 
communities which compose the Mauritanian people." For 
Moukniess, Mauritania belongs to both the Arabo-Berbers and the 
Negro-Africans, while nationalists believe that Mauritania is 
simply an Arab country. 
  "The UDP, which straightaway involved itself in the real 
problems confronting Mauritania, has just suffered a staggering 
blow with the resignation of many key personalities from its 
executive committee. The reason given was differences over 
political policy. Significant among those who have left are, 
Mohamed Ali Cherif, former secretary general of the presidency 
of the Republic under Moctar Ould Dada and chairman of the 
external relations committee of the party; [name indistinct], 
chairman of the economic committee; Yarba Ould Tayir, youth and 
sports officer; and [name indistinct], UDP information officer. 
The party leadership has not reacted yet to the founding 
members' resignation. Their departure, of course, weakens the 
ranks of the Mauritanian opposition." [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by King Hassan II on the occasion of Throne Day, the </F>
33d anniversary of Hassan's accession to the throne, in Rabat -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Last year was full of 
variously important events, diversified according to the time 
and place where they occurred. Most of these events were 
important, however, and they affect our history. Assuredly, as 
days pass, we will adequately appreciate their significance and 
fully understand their lessons. 
  In view of the great upheavals witnessed during the last 
decade, one can say that the post-war era has come to an end and 
that a new era is on the horizon. In our view, the agreement 
signed in Washington will be the most important event defining 
the outlines of the future. What was considered a figment of 
imagination yesterday--or at best a possibility--is gradually 
turning into a reality today in front of our eyes. Perhaps the 
plots and conspiracies will come to an end soon, plots that 
lasted a whole century and that were concocted against a whole 
people and--behind them--the whole Arab nation. However, we 
must not surrender to optimism more than we should, because 
clouds are still hiding the horizons of the future and because 
the road is still full of obstacles. 
  We are satisfied that both parties in the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations are seriously and truly determined to take the 
peace process to its conclusion. As far as we are concerned, we 
have worked for peace for more than 20 years, by calling for it 
and working to achieve it. This allowed us to talk about the 
matter all sides with the required frankness. 
  We told the Israelis that they had to deal with the facts 
because the first Gaza-Jericho agreement is only a stage. Peace 
will not become real and lasting unless it is comprehensive and 
encompasses all the occupied Arab land. As to the Palestinians, 
we brought to their attention the fundamental change their 
behavior must undergo because they are no longer merely fighters 
seeking to liberate their land, but responsible leaders 
answerable to their people and to the world. 
  Yes, it is true that their struggle and their many 
sacrifices 
brought them affection and support from all parts of the world. 
This deserves to be praised, especially since their adversary 
enjoyed the unconditional support of the majority of the great 
powers. Now they must make use of this affection and support 
without hesitation and reap the benefits. The Arab-Israeli 
negotiations are still continuing and are going through 
difficult times, in which it is difficult to disentangle the 
intricacies. Nevertheless, it will reach its aim. The whole 
world wishes for this and works toward it. [passage omitted] 
  We arrive now at the issues of our relations with our 
foreign 
partners and allies. Primary among these problems, naturally, 
is that of the ties that we are trying to ensure between us and 
the EEC. The proposals made to us in December 1993 were not to 
our liking. They did not please us. For this reason, we 
presented to our partners a document containing our reaction to 
these proposals, and recalling, in particular, the decision made 
by the ministerial meeting of the 12 states aimed at concluding 
a new agreement with Morocco based on four main foundations: 
political dialogue; economic, technical, and cultural 
partnership in the sectors of common interest; the gradual 
establishing of a free trade zone; and financial cooperation. 
We insisted, in particular, on the need for Moroccan products 
to enter the EEC market, particularly our agricultural products. 
  As for the European program, it is, regrettably, 
characterized by caution and ambiguity. It is contenting itself 
with maintaining the usual monetary machine. Without clear 
commitment, it makes promises that there will be a discussion in 
the future about financial matters. Pending the early 
implementation of a new agreement--soon, hopefully--Morocco 
believes that beginning now it has become necessary to reexamine 
the current agreement so that it may be in accord with the 
effects of the Uruguay round and the requirements of the 
European Union market. Morocco also urges its partners to be 
more understanding and more open and to treat Morocco the way it 
is treating them. 
  My dear people: Neither the challenges of the issues we have 
just raised nor their priority could make us forget the 
essential issue that comes at the top of our concerns--namely, 
the issue of our territorial unity. We are, as far as our 
Sahara is concerned, still committed to organizing a 
confirmatory, self-determination referendum under UN control 
that will lead to the final joining together of our southern 
provinces with the motherland. 
  Despite the dilatory ambiguities and tricks of our 
opponents, 
we are certain that the international community will know how to 
impose its commitments and implement the various decisions that 
have been agreed upon to this effect. 
  We are naturally pleased--while talking about our 
territorial 
unity--to raise the thorny issue of Ceuta and Mellila and 
neighboring islands that are still under Spanish authority. We 
have been keen so far, in faithfulness to our longstanding 
traditions, to avoid confrontations that would lead us nowhere 
and that might only lead to worsening of relations between Spain 
and Morocco. 
  We have always tried to solve our problems in peaceful ways 
based on consultation and negotiation--always driven by the firm 
conviction that the course of time will not affect our rights 
and that there will be no concessions concerning this part of 
our land. In an attempt to bring our positions and those of our 
neighbor closer, we have proposed to our Spanish friends to 
establish jointly a think tank, which will be in charge of 
examining a solution that would secure the rights of one side 
and preserve the interests of the other. It has become 
impossible to delay the solution indefinitely. Therefore, we 
hope that our proposal will be well received so that a solution 
is found for an abnormal situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An official spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Cooperation said that the Kingdom of Morocco learned 
with deep sorrow and grief of the massacre in Hebron of dozens 
of innocent Palestinians who were performing their religious 
rites in the venerated month of Ramadan and in a place sacred to 
the revealed religions. 
  The official spokesman added that Morocco, as it pays homage 
to the souls of the martyrs, who were martyrs of blind 
extremism, strongly condemns this hideous crime which was 
perpetrated at a time when the international organizations were 
expecting that peace would soon prevail in the region and were 
according particular importance to the recent 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  The spokesman concluded by saying that Morocco, while 
calling 
for the perpetrators of this hideous crime to be severely and 
decisively punished and for the escalation of violence to be 
halted, considers that such acts must be an incentive to 
international organizations to make preparations for 
guaranteeing peace, security, and the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people.

  [Excerpt] Voices of condemnation and denunciation of the 
massacre carried out yesterday by an Israeli terrorist against 
worshipers inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied West 
Bank continue to be raised across the world. 
  His Majesty King Hassan II, may God render him victorious, 
has sent a cable of condolences to the Palestinian president 
Yasir 'Arafat. The cable says: 
  His Excellency and dear brother Mr. Yasir 'Arafat, head of 
the fraternal State of Palestine; 
  We were taken aback by the news of the savage, terrible 
massacre, whose victims were a large number of our innocent 
Palestinian brothers in the occupied territories while they were 
performing the Dawn Prayers in the safe sanctuary of the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on this Friday of the blessed month of 
Ramadan at the hands of criminals who were made by virtue of 
hatred and racism to commit the most ugliest of crimes and take 
mankind back to the dark ages. We strongly deplore this 
abominable and terrible massacre and strongly condemn its 
perpetrators and all those who participated in carrying it out 
by not taking the necessary precautions to avoid it. We beseech 
God Almighty to extend His mercy to the righteous martyrs and to 
grant you and their folks patience and condolences. We also 
request you to be the best interpreter of our feelings to their 
families and relatives. 
  Signed: Your brother Hassan II, King of Morocco. 
  In the same context the official spokesman of the Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs and Cooperation has stated that the Moroccan 
Kingdom has learned with deep sorrow the news of the Hebron 
massacre, which resulted in the death of scores of innocent 
Palestinians while they were performing their religious duties 
during the blessed month of Ramadan and at a place which is holy 
to all heavenly religions. The spokesman added that Morocco, 
while bowing with respect before the souls of the martyrs -- the 
victims of blind extremism -- strongly condemns this abominable 
crime carried out at a time when the international community was 
hoping to establish peace soon in the region and was devoting 
special attention to the recent Palestinian- Israeli agreement. 
The spokesman concluded by saying that Morocco, while appealing 
for the severe and resolute punishment of the perpetrators of 
this abominable crime and for putting an end to the escalation 
of violence, is of the opinion that such acts should be an 
incentive for the international community to mobilize to secure 
peace and security and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian 
people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Communique by the Ministry of Royal Palaces, Protocol, and </F>
Decorations; issued in Rabat on 27 February] 
  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Hassan II, may God render him 
victorious, received Abu-Marwan, ambassador of the State of 
Palestine in Morocco, at the Royal Palace on Saturday evening. 
During the audience his majesty expressed again to the 
ambassador his profound sentiments and condemnation of the 
terrible massacre which was committed by the criminals at the 
holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque [in Hebron]. He reaffirmed to the 
ambassador that this massacre, despite its ugliness and 
severity, will be an incentive for the international community 
to understand more the sufferings of the Palestinian people, and 
for the awareness of the international community of the need for 
the withdrawal of the Israeli forces [from the occupied 
territories] as soon as possible, as these painful events have 
shown beyond any shadow of a doubt that the fanatics have no 
regard for the sanctity of God's houses which are holy places 
for both Muslims and Jews. 
  His majesty the king has graciously decided to adopt the 
families of the martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque -- widows, and 
orphans -- and reaffirmed that the Moroccan Kingdom will 
undertake to meet the needs of these widows and look after their 
children and ensure that they will receive their education until 
they become of age. 
  In view of the aggravation of these events his majesty the 
king phoned the Palestinian president [Yasir 'Arafat] to 
exchange views regarding the steps which ought to be taken to 
confront these situations and their consequences. He expressed 
to him the royal will to look after the families of the martyrs 
-- widows and orphans -- as a gesture of sympathy toward them 
and to share their grief. 
  The ambassador expressed to his majesty the gratitude and 
thanks of the Palestinian people and officials for the wise 
counsel which his majesty continues to provide for the 
Palestinian issue, and for his majesty's continuous attention 
for Holy Jerusalem and the righteous strugglers. He implored 
God Almighty to keep His Majesty as a strong support for his 
homeland and nation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Salih Accuses Socialist </F>
Party of Closing Airspace in South"] 
  [Excerpts] London, Sanaa, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has admitted that he purchased 
arms for the "Yemeni Army" from the state treasury. He said 
that the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP) concluded similar deals 
"whose sources of financing are unknown." He stressed that the 
YSP has closed the airspace in the southern and eastern 
governorate to receive arms shipments from Russia and East 
European states, which include helicopters and various types of 
[military] equipment. 
  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih expressed his 
confusion 
between "external orders" and "internal demands" vis-a-vis the 
efforts being exerted to contain the crisis between the 
(northern) General People's Congress [GPC], which is led by him 
-- and the YSP, whose secretary general is Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, before the problem worsens and turns once again 
into an armed confrontation, especially after the failure of the 
military committee, which is led by Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, 
deputy chief of staff, to disengage the forces in Abyan 
Governorate. 
  This came in the president's meeting with a number of 
dialogue committee members the day before yesterday evening. 
The meeting was described by a spokesman for the GPC as "an 
effort by the dialogue committee to renew its legitimacy after 
the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document, in order to 
resume its work to implement the document." [passage omitted] 
  Salih stressed his commitment to implementing the Pledge 
Document. He urged the need for the Council of ministers to 
convene in Sanaa or to authorize the committee dialogue to 
supervise the work of the government and the military committee. 
  The Yemeni president said at the meeting that Yemen does not 
now have military forces -- an indication that it is "easy" to 
implement the security part of the Pledge and Accord Document, 
thus opening the door to the YSP's return. But some participants 
told him that these forces have been moved to the fringe areas 
to reinforce deployment on the partition border -- which further 
worsens the political crisis, instead of making a move to end it 
and eliminate its effects. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Dr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas </F>
by unidentified correspondent on in Amman on 22 February] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] How do you assess the situation, 
especially after the incidents which followed the signing of the 
Pledge and Accord Document? 
  [Al-'Attas] The situation is difficult, particularly as the 
brothers (in the General People's Congress [GPC]) did not, after 
the signing of the agreement, agree to discuss subsequent steps 
to the signing despite the fact that the Socialist Party [YSP] 
submitted a paper which it hoped would be discussed and signed 
as an annex to the Pledge and Accord Document. That paper 
spells out the steps to follow the signing and discusses ways of 
convening the various bodies in pursuance of the provisions of 
the document proceeds. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What about the deteriorating situation at the 
military level, to be specific? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that what has happened at the military 
level can be contained. That is what we have stressed to the 
brothers in Aden, and they are endeavoring to do that despite 
the provocations and improper activities aimed at dividing the 
people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] But do you not believe that the provocations were 
started by the YSP at some point before the signing of the 
document when you appointed Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad as governor of 
Abyan and in doing so flouted the powers of the Presidential 
Council? 
  [Al-'Attas] No, giving Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad the duties of the 
governor of Abyan was a legal step. Furthermore, before he was 
assigned the duties of governor, the GPC brothers took several 
inappropriate steps in Abyan. The latest military provocations 
were only an extension of these steps. At the request of the 
people of Abyan and in order to calm the situation and reassure 
the people, I issued that decision which is based on cabinet law 
no. 20 of 1991 empowering the prime minister to make any 
decisions he deems fit and then submit them to the cabinet 
within one month for consideration. And so I indeed did assign 
the duties of Abyan governor to Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad. The 
strange truth is that the violations are committed by the other 
side. All the security directors are appointed by them without 
any commitment to and completely ignoring the prime minister. 
The same applies to the heads of directorates and many of the 
legal changes they carry out without having the right to do so, 
encroaching on the very essence of the prime minister's powers. 
I am surprised that they have caused this furor in dealing with 
a particular problem to block a step which was taken in the 
public interest and in an attempt to prevent the sedition which 
some are trying to foment. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In your view, is the unity [of Yemen] in danger? 
  [Al-'Attas] I believe that unity is in the hearts of all the 
good people of Yemen who supported it from the moment it was 
declared and who, in the years following the declaration of 
unity, worked in every possible way to build and consolidate the 
unity state. The fear for unity stems from those who do not 
want to build the unity state and consolidate it to become an 
integral part of the daily life of all compatriots and the basis 
of all central and local practices. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Have these people, then, managed to undermine 
unity? 
  [Al-'Attas] Insistence on their ways, wittingly or 
unwittingly, is harmful to unity. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Let us go back to the military situation. You 
have just received reports about new clashes in Abyan. What is 
your comment on that? 
  [Al-'Attas] At this moment, the military situation can be 
contained but all parties should be willing to do that. I 
believe that the military provocations in Abyan began several 
weeks ago when arms were distributed and when the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade broke out of the lines within which it was allowed to 
move according to the specific directives of the Defense 
Ministry. As a result, it was deployed in positions which had 
been assigned to the Madram Brigade in Abyan Governorate. That 
led the people to the conclusion that the provocative actions of 
the brigade must be stopped. So, we can say that the deployment 
beyond the designated points was the start of the military 
provocations and it led to the limited clash which claimed the 
lives of a number of Yemeni people. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Let us move to another kind of provocation. Do 
you not believe that the tours of 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Salim 
Salih Muhammad are political provocations? They visited some 
Gulf states without coordination with the rest of the 
Presidential Council members. 
  [Al-'Attas] Why? The president ('Ali 'Abdallah Salih) 
himself used to say that any of the Yemeni leaders should be 
given the opportunity to make such visits. He hoped to do that 
himself. I believe that Shaykh 'Abdallah (Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar) 
made some efforts in that direction but the lack of response was 
clear a long time ago. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In view of the recent developments, what do you 
really want and what can you do? 
  [Al-'Attas] It is possible to prevent infighting and find 
peaceful ways out. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Would federation be a way out? 
  [Al-'Attas] Federation or other forms which may be better 
than that. What is important is finding a political way out. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What do you mean by other forms? 
  [Al-'Attas] I do not wish to be specific right now.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Dardiri and Iqbal 'Ali </F>
'Abdallah: "Socialist Party Fears `Somalization' of Yemen"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa, Aden -- The Yemeni situation yesterday 
became a race between political solutions and military 
deterioration in the north and the south of the country -- which 
really threatens a "Somalization," as military sources belonging 
to the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] put it. 
  The new development at the political level was the 
announcement that the Council of Ministers will convene in Aden 
today for five days under the chairmanship of Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Meanwhile the military situation 
continued to deteriorate in Abyan Governorate and in the 'Imran 
area, north of Sanaa, after 24 hours of cautious calm. The 
Council of Ministers meetings in Aden will be devoted to 
examining measures concerning the implementation of the Pledge 
and Accord Document signed by party leaders in Amman 20 February. 
  However, a prominent minister belonging to the General 
People's Congress [GPC], which is led by Lieutenant General 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, pointed 
to the possibility that the GPC ministers will boycott the 
Council of Ministers meetings in Aden. 
  Al-'Attas said that the "call for the ministerial meeting in 
Aden came from the dialogue committee in its meeting on 24 
February in Sanaa, specifically from one of its members, namely 
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anasi, secretary general of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping and deputy prime minister, who headed the committee 
meeting at the which the call for convening the Council of 
Ministers in Aden was announced." 
  The Yemeni prime minister told AL-HAYAH that "the 
deteriorating conditions require that a schedule be drawn up to 
prepare the atmosphere and normalize political conditions, 
ensuring that this program coincides with the implementation of 
the Pledge and Accord Document and makes it possible to activate 
the various organizations." 
  Al-'Attas declined to "talk about the serious military 
deterioration some governorates are experiencing." He merely 
pointed out that "it is regrettable, and there is a military 
committee and a committee for dialogue among the political 
forces. Its task is to halt military operations, which pose a 
serious threat to the homeland's unity." 
  Despite the military quarters' repeated denial that there is 
any new fighting in Abyan or north of Sanaa, where the 5th 
Brigade belonging to former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
is stationed, the Defense Ministry in Yemen insisted on 
confirming the military deterioration. 
  Aden sources said that the military situation in Abyan 
Governorate in the south and the area of Harf Sufyan, north of 
the capital, Sanaa, witnessed a serious development yesterday. 
And that military officials in the south stress that what is 
happening is "the start of Somalization, unless a quick solution 
is found." 
  The Defense Ministry statement in Aden yesterday pointed out 
that the "northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade, which is stationed in 
Abyan, has continued to deploy its personnel and various types 
of weapons, including rocket launchers and heavy artillery, 
toward the areas of al-Saylah, al-Bayda', Modiyah, Wadi Dufas, 
al-Dirjaj, and occupied Jabal Sarar, in addition to its 
large-scale deployment in Zanjibar, capital of the governorate." 
  The statement pointed to the existence of "movements and 
deployments north of Sanaa, as northern troops from Sanaa headed 
toward the 5th Brigade to help the forces besieging the brigade 
belonging to 'Ali Nasir Muhammad." The statement confirmed that 
"the 5th Brigade's commander, Colonel 'Abdallah al-Shalil, 
managed to withdraw to al-Jawf area with the help of the Bakil 
tribes." [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH Col. al-Shalil, who was contacted 
from Aden yesterday, said that "the ferocious attacks he 
experienced were a war of annihilation against the 5th Brigade, 
which was subjected to a ferocious offensive using various types 
of weapons from Saturday evening until its withdrawal the day 
before yesterday." [passage omitted]

chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday evening received 
brother Dr. Khalid al-Karaki, His Majesty King Husayn's adviser. 
  Al-Karaki arrived in Sanaa with a Jordanian military team, 
led by Major Gen. 'Id Kamil, assistant to the Jordanian Army 
chief of staff. The Jordanian team will be partly responsible 
for carrying out the military aspect of the accord document 
signed in the Jordanian capital. It will also handle part of 
the the work of the military committee. 
  Dr. al-Karaki conveyed a message from King Husayn to his 
brother the chairman of the Presidential Council spelling out 
his majesty's efforts to bridge viewpoints and implement the 
accord document. The message reiterated Jordan's keenness to 
see the accord document translated on the ground as an 
achievement that concerns the Arab nation as well as the Yemeni 
people. It indicated that it is the duty of all Arabs to rally 
to Yemen's unity as a pan-Arab project embodying the aspirations 
of Arab unionists and holding out the hope that the dawn of Arab 
unity has arrived. 
  President Salih and Dr. al-Karaki reviewed Yemeni 
developments against the backdrop of the accord document. The 
president told him he and the Yemeni people were appreciative of 
His Majesty King Husayn's and the Jordanian people's pan-Arab 
attitude and genuine concern for unity and democracy in our 
country. The president said he appreciated that Jordan was 
doing all it could to help Yemen ride out the tough challenges 
left by the political crisis. President Salih noted that these 
efforts were crowned by Amman hosting the gathering of Yemeni 
political and social figures to witness the ceremonies for 
signing the accord document. Our people, the president told Dr. 
al-Karaki, will always recognize Jordan's brotherly stands that 
dramatize the profundity of ties between the two brother peoples. 
  The president asked him to convey his greetings to his 
brother His Majesty King Husayn and best wishes for the 
brotherly Jordanian people. The meeting was attended by brother 
'Ali Muhammad al-Anisi, the head of the Presidential Office; 
Maj. Gen. 'Id Kamil, assistant to the Jordanian Army chief of 
staff; and Fayiz al-Rubayyi', the Jordanian ambassador to our 
country.

  [Text] Brother Brigadier Muhammad Haydarah Masdus, deputy 
prime minister and member of the political bureau of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, has categorically denied the statement of the 
General Committee of the General People's Congress, saying that 
it was incorrect in its substance and detail and devoid of 
truth. In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', brother 
Brig. Muhammad Haydarah Masdus described the General Committee's 
statement as sheer fabrication and aiming to obstruct the great 
efforts being made to preserve the national unity of Yemen's 
sons and to preserve it from all forms of violence and 
terrorism. The brother deputy prime minister called on the 
brothers of the permanent committee to attest to the truth of 
even one of their assertions. He appealed to brothers 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the 
Presidential Council; Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of 
the Presidential Council; Haydar Abu-Bakr al-Attas, chairman of 
the Council of Ministers; and the brother chairman of the 
Security and Military Committee urgently to form an 
investigation committee to expose the individuals who are 
distributing arms and forming assassination squads in Abyan 
Governorate, as well as those who are financing them. 
  Brother Brig. Muhammad Haydarah Masdus stressed that he had 
frequently spoken and continued to speak against the 
distribution of arms and the deployment of military forces in 
Abyan Governorate. This is what he told the military committee 
chaired by Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, the deputy chief of 
staff, in the presence of the U.S. military attache.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the higher council of the </F>
Yemeni Reform Grouping; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate, who said: And fear tumult or oppression, which 
affecteth not in particular only those of you who do wrong. 
[koranic verse] Prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad 
and all his kin and companions. In these blessed days all our 
people from al-Maharah to Sa'dah are hoping for an end to the 
crisis that has affected every aspect of our lives and 
aggravated our people's pain and suffering. Our people have been 
waiting for their political leaders to return to attend to their 
duties and for state agencies to fulfill their Constitutional 
tasks and carry out the accord document after it was signed in 
Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February]. 
  Thus, our patient people are surprised by the military 
movements and the incidents that have sparked off the crisis 
anew and threatened the unity, security, and stability of the 
homeland. These incidents were orchestrated as a device to 
weasel out of the responsibility for implementing the provisions 
of the accord document and then to drift to only God knows what 
fate. 
  The higher council of the Yemeni Reform Grouping has been 
following these developments and the irresponsible media hype 
about them. It contacted official circles with the aim of 
bringing the situation under control and keeping irresponsible 
actions from getting out of hand. The higher council condemns 
these regrettable incidents that can only harm the homeland and 
the citizens and play into the hands of the haters of the 
homeland's unity, security, and stability. It calls on all the 
parties to be equal to their religious, national, and historic 
responsibilities and work toward bringing these incidents to an 
end and ensuring that they do not recur. The council calls for 
the relocation of all military units to their positions and for 
the Armed Forces to be kept out of political and party disputes. 
This is in order for them to remain a source of strength for 
the homeland and a shield for the country's sovereignty and 
independence and the community's security and welfare and to be 
kept unaffected by political considerations and narrow party 
interests. 
  The council calls on all political forces and the citizens 
from all walks of life to exercise vigilance and not allow 
themselves to be drawn into any actions that may hurt the 
homeland or its unity. It also calls for forestalling the 
advocates of sedition who do not care for the well-being of the 
Yemeni people and are used to living in a climate of bloody 
conflict and deception and breaking promises and breaching 
charters. 
  The higher council calls on the competent authorities to 
speed up the enquiry into the incidents and name those who were 
responsible and disclose facts to the people lest they remain at 
the mercy of internal and external misinformation. We pray that 
God keep our country and people and spare us all [word 
indistinct] and lead us all to all that is good and our leaders 
to the right ways.

  [Text] Sanaa, 27 Feb (INA)- A source at the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG], one of the three ruling coalition parties in 
Yemen, has denied reports of its complicity in military 
incidents that occurred in the Yemeni Governorate of Abyan last 
Monday. 
  In a statement to the press in Sanaa last night, the source 
asserted that the YRG has never been a party in any bloody 
military dispute among the sons of Yemen. 
  Press reports had accused the grouping of sending armed men 
to escalate the military incidents against the Yemeni Socialist 
Party's supporters in the Abyan Governorate.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Governor Requests Withdrawal of </F>
All Forces; al-'Amaliqah Attempt Eradicates Fundamentalists From 
al-Maraqishah"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Political sources in 
Aden have said that the bloody incidents sparked off by the 
(northern) al-'Amaliqah Brigade in Abyan Governorate four days 
ago were aimed at preventing Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, one of former 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad's men, from assuming his duties in 
implementation of the decision issued by Yemeni Prime Minister 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. 
  The sources pointed out that al-'Amaliqah's attempt received 
the support of Jihad elements and the fundamentalist militias to 
besiege the battalions of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and 
clash with the Madram Brigade (partisan militias), but it failed 
to achieve its aims. In fact it enabled the Socialist Party to 
correct a mistake which had existed since January 1986, namely 
reinforcing its military presence in Abyan and destroying 
fundamentalist infiltration, which took place after the 
establishment of unity. 
  Southern forces succeeded in storming the Afghan Arabs' 
centers in the al-Maraqishah mountains. High-level political 
sources arriving in Aden from Abyan the day before yesterday 
said that 90 Afghan Arabs from the Jihad organizations have been 
arrested and 30 killed. And that the others are being pursued 
in the northern Abyan heights toward the northern governorate of 
al-Bayda'. 
  The source accused northern army commanders of supporting 
the 
Afghan Arabs, who were stationed in Abyan, and of supplying them 
with food and military equipment. The sources said that these 
did not exist before unity and they began to arrive in Shabwah, 
Hadhramout, and Abyan after unity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, Feb 26 (AFP)--Southern troops are preparing 
for a major offensive to capture the strategic town of Qa'tabah, 
a spokesman of the northern General People's Congress (GPC) 
Party charged Saturday. 
  "The YSP (Yemen Socialist Party) has massed troops and heavy 
weapons near the former border," which used to divide the former 
North and South Yemen republics before they united in May 1990, 
the spokesman told AFP. 
  "Their forces are getting ready to capture the strategic 
town 
of Qa'tabah, whose occupation would allow them to enter Ibb," a 
city deeper inside the northern region, he charged. 
  The YSP "seeks to trigger a full-blown war," he charged. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's GPC -- which ruled the 
former North Yemen -- and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's YSP 
-- which ruled the South -- decided to share power upon 
unification, but they have not merged armies. 
  The GPC spokesman accused the YSP of sending several tanks, 
37 Russian-made armoured vehicles and nearly thirty 36 
millimeter (1.44 inch) guns to 'Awabil, Shi'b al-Khanaq and 
Jahaf provinces, adjoining the former border. 
  The southern party on Friday distributed 3,000 light weapons 
to its militiamen in these provinces, he added. 
  The YSP has also bought from Bulgaria several fighter 
aircraft that landed in the past few days in the southern 
airports of Aden, capital of the former South Yemen, and 
al-Rayan, he said. 
  Tens of tons of military uniforms, tents and blankets were 
unloaded lately in the airport of Hadhramaut Province, 500 
kilometers (300 miles) north east of Aden, he said. 
  Salih and al-Bid have been locked in a political showdown 
since August, when al-Bid refused to take up his duties as vice 
president in the capital Sanaa, in the north, demanding major 
economic, political and security reforms. 
  A reconciliation agreement signed on February 20 by Salih 
and 
al- Bid in Amman has failed so far to end the crisis as nearly 
20 soldiers have been killed in clashes between rival army units 
since then. 
  Yemeni Minister of Defense Haytham Qasim al-Tahir, a 
southerner, on Friday said the military commission in charge of 
implementing the security measures agreed upon in Amman has 
failed to stop escalation.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah in London and unattributed </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT report from Sanaa: "People of al-Dali' Besiege 
Northern Brigade in Yemen"] 
  [Text] Yemeni military sources have confirmed that forces 
of the (northern) 2d Armored Brigade stationed at al-Kabsi camp 
in al-Rahah area near Radfan (about 160 km north of Aden) 
yesterday came out of their barracks and spread out in nearby 
villages and valleys with the aim of besieging the southern town 
of al-Dali'. 
  At the same time the northern al-'Amaliqah Brigade in the 
southern governorate of Abyan yesterday also continued to deploy 
heavily in the town of Zinjibar after storming and seizing the 
security command headquarters in the governorate. 
  That northern military move came less than one hour after 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who is also the secretary 
general of the General People's Congress [GPC], and his Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who is the secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], signed an authorization giving the 
Joint Military Committee full powers to put an end to the 
military clashes between northern and southern forces. 
  Political sources have stressed that the crisis of trust 
which has now spread from the political to the military sector 
might hamper the implementation of any agreement. According to 
military sources in Aden, the people of al-Dali yesterday came 
out to confront the forces of the (northern) 2d Armored Brigade 
to prevent them from moving their armor and to force them to 
return to the positions they held before. 
  Military reports also said yesterday that the al-'Amaliqah 
Brigade was still refusing to obey any orders to return to its 
barracks on the outskirts of the southern town of Zinjibar. 
  The sources said that the 5th Light Infantry Brigade loyal 
to 
former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad was totally destroyed and 
that the real number of victims of the heavy bombardment of that 
brigade by the 1st Armored Division commanded by Colonel 'Ali 
Muhsin al-Ahmar was still unknown. 
  The sources added: "The crime was not just what happened to 
the soldiers loyal to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad near 
Sanaa, but also the fact that those who did it are denying that 
there was such a barracks in that area. That is what they said 
to the military team which visited Harf Sufyan north of 'Umran."

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, Feb 27 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni troops 
attacked a southern brigade with heavy artillery, killing 12 and 
wounding at least 30, a Defence Ministry spokesman said here 
Sunday. 
  The report was denied by a spokesman for President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih's General People's Congress (GPC) in Sanaa, the 
northern capital. 
  The spokesman for the Defence Ministry, which is controlled 
by Salih's southern rival, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
said units of the northern first mechanised division attacked a 
base of the southern Fifth Infantry Brigade at Harf Sufyan, 
north of Sanaa, late Saturday. 
  "Twelve members of the (southern) brigade were killed and 
about 30 others wounded," the spokesman said, adding that the 
northern troops prevented the wounded from being evacuated. The 
base was still ringed by northern troops Sunday. 
  A spokesman for al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) 
confirmed that the attack took place. 
  Military mediators from Jordan and Oman drew up a five-point 
plan on Sunday to halt clashes between northern and southern 
army units in which at least 20 people were killed last week. 
  Officials in Sanaa said the mediators called on the opposing 
sides to ban new troop movements, return to their positions 
before the clashes, free prisoners and return the weapons 
seized, dismantle checkpoints and halt the media campaign 
against each other. 
  The GPC, which ruled the former North Yemen, and the YSP, 
which ruled the south, decided to share power when the country 
was united in May 1990, but the armies were not merged. 
  Salih and al-Bid have been locked in a political dispute 
since August, when al-Bid refused to take up his duties as vice 
president in the northern capital Sanaa, demanding major 
economic, political and security reforms. 
  A reconciliation agreement signed in Amman on February 20 
has 
failed so far to end the crisis, and at least 20 soldiers have 
been killed in clashes in the southern Abyan province.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj on interview with Shaykh Naji </F>
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif, chief of the Yemeni Bakil tribes, 
in Jeddah; date not given] 
  [Text] Shaykh Naji Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shayif, chief of 
the Yemeni Bakil tribes, expects a separation to take place 
between the two parts of Yemen. He said: "The separation has 
existed since olden times, and there is nothing for Yemen to 
lose from this separation." 
  In an interview in Jeddah al-Shayif told AL-HAYAH that 
"unity 
grants no superiority over anyone." He accused "those who made 
the Pledge and Accord Document" of planning not only to separate 
the south from the north, but to establish five separate 
regions, each divided into several governorates with their own 
resources, independence, and sovereignty, to be united 
temporarily under the Council of Ministers and then become 
independent later." 
  Al-Shayif described Yemeni unity as "abnormal; it does not 
reflect the will of the two parts of Yemen. And it has never 
been in the interests of the Yemeni people or friendly states in 
the region." 
  He expected "the ties of unity binding north and south Yemen 
to split soon at the end of the current tragic events." 
  He said that "the current deterioration in conditions 
between 
the two parts is the result of developments which are not new. 
They are the result of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn, whose ambition was to seize the Arabian Peninsula 
as a whole. And when the scheme aimed against the region's 
states and its friends, they [Yemeni leaders] invented the unity 
between the two parts with a view to destroying Yemen and its 
people. The outcome is the infighting and dispute which 
everyone is watching and which is harmful to Yemen." 
  He said that "by allying with the communists, they tried to 
sabotage Yemen's relations with its friends and brothers." 
Al-Shayif accused those he called "Shiite leaders" of 
"cooperating with the communists to openly instigate subversive 
actions in Yemen in order to attribute them to Yemen -- 
government and people." He noted that "the aim is for Yemen and 
its people to be held responsible for what the communists did in 
order to divide the people of the one march in Yemen and the 
Arabian Peninsula." 
  He said: "As for the Socialist Party and the other parties 
allied with it, they caused the disaster." He added: "We felt 
sorry for our colleagues who were fooled by the methods of 
deception and did not wake up until recently, that is, until the 
introduction of the Pledge and Accord Document by the dialogue 
committee." He said that those who formulated this document 
"are members of the parties allied with the Socialist Party, 
nothing of which is left except its name, as socialism has died 
in the world as a whole." 
  He pointed out that members of the dialogue committee 
composed of the leaders of the parties allied with the Socialist 
Party "are running affairs in Yemen, even though they do not 
enjoy the support of honorable Yemeni citizens." He said that 
leaders of the Socialist Party "have reached that level only 
with the help of leaders of the General People's Congress and 
some of its members, who are working behind the scenes to serve 
the Socialist Party." 
  He criticized the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the General 
People's Congress, the House of Representatives, and the 
Presidential Council, which he said "lack authority, as affairs 
are run behind the scenes by elements from the Shiites allied 
with the communists." 
  He said that he had warned of the danger of what is 
happening 
at a meeting of Yemeni tribal chiefs held under him a few months 
ago. 
  He said that "what is happening in Yemen at present is that 
the ship is steered by the dialogue committee arising from 
Shiite sources, which pushes everyone to implement its members' 
schemes." 
  He stressed that "if the situation continues as it stands, 
we 
will find ourselves compelled to intervene and obliged to take a 
decisive initiative, even if hostile groups interpret it as 
aimed against our comrades in destiny. What we are interested 
in is to tackle the general situation, in which our comrades in 
common destiny are interested."

  [Text] Sanaa, 3 Mar (INA)--Two Yemeni figures have warned 
against a suspicious scheme that is being carried out in Yemen 
to effect an irreversible secession through infighting. 
  In a statement aired over the Yemeni Television last night 
and relayed by the INA correspondent in Sanaa, Yemeni Deputy 
Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and 
opposition National Grouping Chairman Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum 
said that they have become convinced beyond any shadow of doubt 
that the scheme to effect an irreversible secession in the 
country is being carried out with sure steps, and that secession 
will be effected through bloodshed and a bitter infighting 
between the two parties to the conflict. 
  The two Yemeni officials asserted that the all Yemenis are 
responsible for safeguarding Yemen and its unity. They 
indicated that the accord document recently signed in Amman is 
the property of all the Yemeni people, and not that of a single 
ruler, party, or group. They held the Yemeni people responsible 
for protecting and defending this document. 
  The statement issued by the two Yemeni officials appealed to 
the Yemeni Army not to get involved in acts that could shed the 
blood of their fathers, brothers, and sons just to promote the 
interests of certain persons or parties, as such a thing would 
harm the interests of 14 million Yemenis. They asserted that 
they have made persistent efforts to achieve a minimum 
understanding between the parties to the conflict.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, yesterday evening met with the brother members 
of the Joint Military Committee, which comprises a Jordanian 
work team headed by Staff Major General 'Id Kamil Ramadan; an 
Omani work team headed by Staff Major General 'Abd-al-'Alim 
(?Murtahin Rakhbut); Staff Colonel 'Ali Muhammad Salah, deputy 
army chief of staff for operations; and Colonel Muhammad Haytham 
Qasim, deputy army chief of staff for logistics. 
  The brother president was apprised of the progress of the 
committee's work, and of the outcome of its field activities. 
He was also briefed on the positive and gladdening results it 
has achieved in terms of ending military escalation and making 
preparations for the implementation of the military provisions 
enshrined in the accord document. 
  During the meeting, agreement was reached on a timetable for 
the withdrawal of Armed Forces units from contact lines to the 
pre- crisis positions they occupied before 19 August 1993, 
beginning with the western area in Bab el Mandeb, the central 
axis, and up to the eastern axis of Shabwah, Ma'rib, Hadramaut, 
and al-Mahrah, in implementation of the provisions enshrined in 
the accord document, and within the context of the authorization 
document the Joint Military Committee has received. The 
authorization document was signed by the brother Presidential 
Council chairman, who is the supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, and the brother vice president. This agreement is meant 
to spare our Yemeni people any bloody armed conflicts that could 
put the homeland and its unity in jeopardy. It is also designed 
to thwart the efforts of warmongers, advocates of secession, the 
enemies of unity and democracy, and all enemies of the Yemeni 
homeland. Similarly, it is meant to defeat all attempts to 
undermine the homeland's security and stability and push our 
country into the furnace of a destructive war. This agreement 
also seeks to frustrate the endeavors of those who, while 
engaged in oneupmanship, seek to capitalize on national issues 
at the expense of the people, promote selfish and parochial 
interests, build personal glories at the expense of the 
homeland's higher interests, and return our people to the period 
that preceded 22 May 1990. 
  The brother president and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces asserted his constant support for the Military 
Committee's work. He indicated that he instructed the commands 
of both the Ministry of Defense and the Army General Staff to 
provide all possible facilities and extend every possible 
assistance to the committee to enable it to accomplish its 
mission, halt and eliminate all effects of the military 
escalation, and supervise the withdrawal of all units to their 
pre-crisis positions. He underlined the need for all to commit 
themselves to national constants, and also to the provisions 
enshrined in the accord document. He also underscored the 
importance of the speedy implementation of the provisions 
enshrined in the accord document without any delay or 
procrastination. 
  Salih emphasized that our Yemeni people will not condone any 
circumvention of the document or any encroachment on their 
national gains, especially unity and democracy. He called on 
all the political and righteous forces in Yemen and all our 
people to cooperate effectively with the armed and security 
forces to help them carry out their sacred national duties in 
defending the country's sovereignty and independence and in 
pooling efforts to build the 22 May Homeland [reference to the 
1990 Yemen unity date] on firm and strong basis and in a spirit 
of national responsibility. 
  The brother president said that the armed and security 
forces 
belong to the people. They are the walls of the homeland and 
its impregnable fortress. They will never be a tool to destroy 
the country and its gains or a means of oppression, terror, and 
domination for the sake of a group whose only care is to ensure 
its remaining in power; a group which rejects submission to 
people's desire and opposes democracy and the principle of 
peaceful exchange of power.

  [Text] The higher joint military committee, which is made 
up of the deputy chiefs of staff for operations and logistics, 
the heads of the Jordanian and the Omani military committees, 
and the U.S. and French military attaches, has held a meeting. 
It reviewed the military situation and the extent of the 
commitment to the implementation of the military document issued 
by the brother chairman and vice chairman of the Presidential 
Council on the need for the return of all military units to 
their positions before the crisis. 
  The committee discussed the results of the field action and 
the extent of the military units' commitment to implementation 
through the reports submitted by the subcommittees supervising 
field activity. 
  The higher joint military committee asserts that the return 
to previous positions is proceeding well in Ta'izz, Lahd, Abyan, 
and Ibb. The committee has great confidence that the leaders of 
the groups and units in the rest of the regions have started to 
return to the agreed-upon locations. 
  The committee has decided to form a third subcommittee to 
supervise and monitor the return of units to their previous 
positions in Ma'rib and Shabwah. This subcommittee will start 
work tomorrow morning. 
  The higher military committee urges the brother [words 
indistinct] maximum degree of cooperation to facilitate the work 
of the subcommittees by carrying out the decisions issued to 
them in executive orders from the defense minister and the chief 
of the General Staff. 
  The higher military committee is working around the clock. 
It reassures the Yemeni people that there is a spirit of 
cooperation and accord between its sons and that everyone is 
concerned about the unity and cohesion of the Armed Forces to 
preserve Yemeni national unity.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, received a phone call this 
evening from his brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader 
of the Libyan 1 September revolution. The two sides discussed 
several issues of interest to the two fraternal countries, as 
well as developments that interest our Arab nation. They also 
discussed the developments in our country in light of the 
signing of the pledge and accord document and the efforts 
exerted to end the political crisis and face the challenges that 
are imposed on the march of unity and democracy in our country. 
  The brother president reassured his brother Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi on the situation in our country, explaining to him 
that progress is being made to contain the crisis and tackle its 
regrettable repercussions. He pointed out that all the good 
forces in the homeland are pursuing efforts to eliminate the 
hotbeds of tension, implement the accord document, and adopt 
peaceful dialogue as a means for settling all disagreements and 
differences. 
  During the phone conversation, the brother president 
referred 
to the successes the joint military committee has scored on the 
level of checking the military repercussions and making the 
necessary preparations to implement the military part of the 
accord document. 
  The brother president expressed thanks and appreciation to 
his brother President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and the brothers in 
Libya for their sincere brotherly stands, which embody an 
eagerness to safeguard the march of unity and democracy in our 
country. He also praised the pan-Arab role the brothers in 
Libya have carried out to support our country and all the unity 
efforts that brought about the establishment of the Republic of 
Yemen on 22 May 1990. 
  For his part, brother Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of 
the Libyan 1 September revolution, voiced Libya's strong and 
uninterrupted support for Yemeni unity, stressing that stands by 
the side of all the good efforts that seek to preserve the unity 
march, given that it is a pan-Arab objective and a beacon for 
all the Arab unionists. He reaffirmed that Libya cannot but be

harm the republic.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Baghdad-based National Command of </F>
the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party on 3 March 1994] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Children of our mujahid Arab nation; children of 
Iraq and Palestine; O Arab strugglers, children of the Ba'th 
Party: 
  The massacre at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque adds yet another 
tragic, bleeding event to the Arabs' wounds in Palestine, the 
Arab homeland, and the Muslim world. This was a major wound to 
dignity that reminds us of the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque in 
Jerusalem. It reminds us of the unseen reasons behind it, warns 
us against its serious consequences, specifies the disease in 
the body of the nation, and reveals a painful and depressing 
defect in Arab reactions and the contradiction that continues to 
expand between the true substance of the nation and its current 
reality. 
  The picture of this event -- the picture of worshipers at 
dawn prayer, kneeling to Allah in the mihrab of Ibrahim 
[Abraham] -- has entered into the mind of the Arab people and 
the Muslim peoples as a clear embodiment of the true nature of 
the Zionist entity, the deep wound in the Arab and Muslim 
realities, and the dimensions of the conspiracy against the Arab 
nation's future. 
  Such an event symbolizes the substantive meanings that 
reveal 
the nature and full dimensions of the challenge, which cannot be 
dealt with from a classical view or through an immediate 
reaction. It requires a daring, thorough thought about one's 
self and the event. Those who are today voicing denunciations 
and condemnations and showing outrage, as well as those who 
pretend to have been outraged, should not only express pain and 
outrage. They should ask the basic question: Why was Palestine 
usurped? The Ibrahimi Mosque event must make Arabs ask this 
question again. It should make them raise their political 
analyses to a level that goes beyond the logic of the regimes 
that have given in to negative realities and circumstances and 
to the schemes of enemies that made the Arab conditions reach 
such a position. 
  Such a major event combines the meanings and images that 
remind us of the origins of the Palestinian and Arab national 
and pan-Arab tragedies and the conspiracy against the Arab 
nation's future and destiny. Therefore, emphasizing the 
substantive meanings of the Ibrahimi Mosque event and turning 
these feelings into mature action and a (noble?) view of a 
genuine strategy to face current challenges is the sound way to 
deal with this bloody event, in which a new group of Palestinian 
martyrs joined the caravan of Arab struggle. 
  O valiant sons of Arabism: The massacre of the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque raises several significant questions. The 
bloody incident raises the question of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. It reasserts its new dimensions, which were absent 
from the plans of those who are working to resolve the Palestine 
question and those who are running after crumbs of humiliation 
and unfair solutions. These solutions hold an arrogant, usurping 
criminal to be the same as a victim whose self-defense 
capability, existence, rights, and destiny are restrained by 
Western powers and Zionism. 
  This horrible massacre brings into question anew the root of 
the problem, namely, the Zionist occupation. It exposes old and 
new Western intentions to encroach on the Arab nation's rights 
to progress by continuing a colonialist policy that is permeated 
with a Zionist spirit bearing grudges against Arabism and Islam. 
The new massacre raises anew the question about the real role 
of the Zionist entity, a role that manifests itself in this 
barbarous example of terror and collective killing, a role that 
holds all values in contempt and whose only aim is to hamper the 
Arab nation's cultural and human progress. It embodies an 
example of the cultural degeneration that is revealed if we 
compare the scene of the worshipers, portraying the meaning of 
human faith, and the scene of Zionist treachery that depicts 
Zionism's racist nature as well as the hatred and rancor imbibed 
by Zionist generations who have made their first aim 
annihilating the Arabs. 
  Thus, the grave incident portrays the contradiction between 
the line of the capitulationist settlement on the one hand and 
the real nature of the Zionist enemy and the real dimension of 
the Arab-Israeli struggle on the other, shedding light on plans 
and schemes aimed at opening the door for transforming the Arab 
region into a graveyard of its own history and people's rights 
and wiping out its national identity and the aspirations of its 
masses. The characteristics of jihad as manifested in the 
Mother of Battles have thus reasserted their values, 
strengthened their principled logic, and renewed the nation's 
confidence in facing he challenges, no matter how great and 
immense they may be. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque incident might have been just a new 
wound 
in the nation's body had it not been for the spirit of jihad 
released by the Mother of Battles which saved this body from 
being totally paralyzed, opening new horizons for the Arab 
struggle and making clear what is possible and what is not 
possible in light of the clarity of the nation's substance, the 
level of deception in it and the exposure of the deceivers and 
the great distance that separates them from the line of the 
mujahidin. 
  O free Palestinians and Arabs. The factors of the current 
Palestinian, Arab, and international situation are interacting 
to express the nation's substance and cultural struggle in 
facing the aggressive Western colonialist policies and Zionism's 
fascist, racist, domineering, and expansionist nature. The 
Mother of Battles opened the door for a new phase of mass 
struggle. Therefore, despite its grave and disastrous nature, 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre brought a new powerful shock to the 
nation and released the anger of the broad masses in the Arab 
homeland against the settlement scheme to liquidate the 
Palestinian cause. It reaffirmed the truthfulness of the Mother 
of Battle's principled stand of jihad in expressing the nation's 
dignity, honor, and the future of Palestine and Arabism. 
  The time has come for a discussion in this spirit by the 
nation's free men in a pan-Arab program, and for emphasizing the 
pan-Arab nature of the battle for a comprehensive mass 
confrontation of the Zionist challenge and the capitulationist 
settlement line. 
  Now that our Palestinian people have given their opinion on 
all the capitulationist formulas, the nation is motivated to 
take care of its central cause and to effect a program of 
struggle that is farsighted and carefully wrought, which will 
transform the revenge for the martyrs blood into profound 
motives for entrenching the principled stand for the sake of 
liberation, for strengthening the spirit of jihad and the 
struggle for unity, and for raising the confrontation to a new 
and advanced level on the road to liberation and to the 
realization of pan-Arab aims. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque incident reveals to those who had 
believed that the Gaza-Jericho agreement had ended the 
Arab-Zionist struggle and placed the Palestinian cause on the 
brink of liquidation that they are deceiving themselves. This 
is because this illusion presents a superficial, unrealistic 
view of the nature of the struggle and an incorrect picture of 
the nature of the enemy. To attach new traits to the Zionist 
enemy that do not match its nature is a matter of theorization 
in order to justify the retreat from the real principled stand 
and the correct revolutionary concept of the nation's resources. 
  The unprincipled agreements, no matter under what names and 
regardless of their descriptions, are an abandonment of the 
substance of the nation and the understanding of the enemy's 
nature. The chaste blood shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the 
betrayed blood that will be added to the rivers of blood in 
Palestine and the Arab arenas of struggle, coupled with the pain 
twisting in our hearts as a nation facing immense dangers, call 
upon us to reconsider and contemplate, stop this capitulationist 
policy and restore the principled awareness that binds our 
nationalist stands in various arenas. Foremost of these arenas 
is the one in which the nation expressed its historic readiness 
to confront the challenges besieging us and the capitulationist 
schemes that contradict our real nature as a mujahid nation 
capable of steadfastness in the face of this barbarous and evil 
aggression, which assumed the most terrible dimension during the 
30-state aggression against Iraq and the most treacherous and 
grotesque picture in the attack on the Ibrahimi Mosque and the 
worshipping faithful during the month of Ramadan, the symbol of 
peace and Islam. 
  The incident reveals the enemy's brutality in the face of 
the 
humane Arabism and its contemporary cultural endeavor. 
  Children of Arabism and Islam: Adhering to the principled 
course constitutes the boat of survival for the nation. If the 
struggling Arab forces are incapable of engaging in equal, 
decisive battles under the current pan-Arab circumstances, this 
does not absolve them from standing fast and harassing the 
enemies in order to confuse their plans and weaken their 
resources and morale, until the day when conditions for decisive 
battles become available. Introducing the criteria for what is 
correct and what is biased in the current positions is one of 
the most important requirements for struggle and jihad in this 
circumstance. 
  Therefore, despite the seeming disequilibrium in the balance 
of forces in favor of the imperialist and Zionist camp, the 
Ibrahimi Mosque crime reveals the bankruptcy of Zionist methods 
in the face of Arab resistance to occupation and usurpation. It 
confirms the ability of the militant Arab forces to stand fast 
and resist as long as they abide by the principled course, which 
sticks to national and pan-Arab rights, as the realistic, 
genuine course that understands the nature of the decisive, 
cultural conflict the nation is fighting in defense of its right 
to life and renaissance. 
  Consequently, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of the 
Mother of Battles and the stone-throwing heroes, must be 
maintained. It must continue in the nation and must expand, be 
entrenched, and spread in the greater Arab homeland because this 
spirit will decide the final outcome of the conflict and the 
cultural and humanitarian meanings of the national and pan-Arab 
liberation struggle. 
  Arabs may not be able to regain all of their rights now. 
However, by maintaining their principled positions and honor, 
they can guarantee the future and create new militant formulas 
by siding with the masses to revive militant and jihad popular 
action in national and pan-Arab life and transform emerging 
events, regardless of how great their challenges may be, and 
threats and pains into futuristic phenomena and steady steps on 
the path of the future, which the nation and its sacrifices are 
worthy of. 
  If you aid God, he will aid you. [part of a Koranic verse] 
  Long live Palestine, free and Arab; 
  Long live the struggle of the people of Palestine and the 
stone-throwing children; 
  Long live the principled, jihad confrontation in the 
Mother of Battles; 
  Long live the mujahid people of Iraq; 
  Long live the nation of the Arabs, free and glorious.

  [Text] Baghdad, 4 Mar (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz has stressed that the bad advisers to the U.S. President, 
who are pushing the U.S. Administration into taking rancorous 
and illogical stands and are preventing the UN Security Council 
from fulfilling its obligations toward Iraq, will reap the 
results of their shallow and rancorous positions. 
  Reacting to a recent article by U.S. National Security 
Adviser Tony Lake in FOREIGN AFFAIRS magazine, in which Lake 
discusses what he calls the double containment policy, 'Aziz 
told INA that these advisers are involving their president in 
incorrect positions and pushing U.S. policy in the region to a 
dead end. 
  Tariq 'Aziz added that the position announced by U.S. 
National Security Adviser Tony Lake -- in which he adopts the 
views of his professional Zionist assistant, Martin Indyk -- 
reflects a rancorous, hostile, colonialist attitude, as well as 
the shallow thinking of U.S. President Bill Clinton's advisers. 
  'Aziz said: Tony Lake speaks of peoples and nations as if he 
is playing a computer game. He forgets the facts of history and 
the will of the peoples, which, in the end, is the decisive 
factor that determines results. 
  Tariq 'Aziz explains that this adviser, who lacks sufficient 
knowledge of history, the social and political facts of the 
region, and conditions inside Iraq, cannot provide any 
convincing evidence to prove the policy he is promoting has 
achieved any of its objectives. 
  He noted that the insistence on maintaining the blockade 
against Iraq is not only a hostile and evil course, but is also 
the wrong course and will not achieve any of the declared 
objectives stated by the U.S. policy planners. 
  He stressed that Iraq is a deep-rooted country that has a 
superb ability to stand fast and that its people are strongly 
behind their national leadership and have proved this on the 
ground. He also said the reports Tony Lake mentions about the 
domestic situation inside Iraq are silly and are based on 
sources with no credibility whatsoever. This information, 'Aziz 
added, is given to the U.S. Administration by elements who are 
paid for their worthless services by U.S. intelligence services 
and the governments of Jabir [Kuwait] and Fahd [Saudi Arabia]. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said the game of containing peoples and states 
by 
applying pressure and extortion is a losing game that will lead 
to a dead end. He said the correct way to build security and 
stability in the region and the world is to show respect for the 
will of the peoples and their legitimate interests, and to deal 
with them in a civilized manner. 
  Regarding Iraq's position on issues of security and 
stability in the region that were discussed by Tony Lake, the 
deputy prime minister said: Iraq was, and will remain, a 
principal factor influencing security and stability in the 
region. The policy of weakening Iraq that the United States has 
been following will not improve the state of security and 
stability, as suggested by Lake. Instead, it has led to 
increasing tension and chaos, and led, in effect, to indirect 
U.S. occupation of the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. It also 
led -- and this is clearly a fact -- to the impoverishment of 
the states of the Peninsula and the Gulf and the squandering of 
their wealth. These states were very rich before the aggression 
against Iraq, but are now in debt and have lost all their 
reserves. Their future is no longer guaranteed. This reality 
is one of the factors threatening security and stability in the 
region. These facts also refute this shallow and wrong course 
which Clinton's advisers are promoting. 
  Tariq 'Aziz said: These advisers are involving their 
president in wrong positions. In the most recent letter they 
prepared for him to send to Congress on policy toward Iraq, they 
included lies and flagrant falsehoods. The content of that 
letter contradicts the statements and documents issued by the UN 
Security Council Special Commission and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. It also includes silly allegations that do not 
agree with reason and logic or geographic facts in Iraq. 
  'Aziz added: Such advisers are pushing U.S. policy in the 
region to a dead end. The allies in the region, referred to by 
Lake in his article as pillars that guarantee this policy, are 
now weaker in all aspects -- political, economic, and security 
-- than they were before the aggression against Iraq. So, how 
can they guarantee for Mr. Lake the objectives he has drawn for 
U.S. policy in the region? 
  Tariq 'Aziz said: Iraq has fulfilled its obligations as 
stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions. This dictates 
that Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 should be implemented 
immediately and without setting any additional conditions.

  [Text] United Nations, 3 Mar (INA)--In an official letter 
to the UN secretary general, Iraq has refuted Max Van der 
Stoel's claims, saying the claims lack credibility and are full 
of fallacies. 
  In its reply to Van der Stoel's report, Iraq clarified that 
his anti-Iraq claims fall within the framework of the political 
role assigned to him to create crises and to serve aggressive 
foreign schemes against Iraq. 
  The letter, whose official text was published here today, 
Thursday, says that by doing so, Van der Stoel exposes the role 
assigned to him to prevent the international community from 
lifting the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  The letter notes that Van der Stoel's report is based on 
claims by persons who live in Iran, London, and the Hague, and 
who are known for their hostility to Iraq and for their desire 
to harm it pursuant to achieving suspect political objectives 
that have nothing whatsoever to do with human rights. 
  Iraq's letter clarifies that Max Van der Stoel's report is 
based on blind provocation, and that, consequently, Van der 
Stoel was not neutral or objective, but biased, and that he 
violated the task assigned to him. 
  The Iraqi letter exposes Max Van der Stoel's claims 
paragraph 
by paragraph. It says: Van der Stoel did not take the trouble 
to verify what he claims, in terms of information or the 
fabricated videotapes and photographs that were supplied to him 
by hostile political sides linked with foreign forces whose 
objective is to create confusion and to tarnish Iraq's 
reputation. 
  The letter stresses Iraq's official stand toward providing 
all the requirements of security and protection for all its 
citizens in accordance with its national laws and international 
commitments, and toward securing all their civil, political, 
economic, social, and cultural rights all over Iraq. 
  The letter adds that what the competent authorities do is 
part of the Iraqi state's responsibility and basic national 
duties of maintaining security and stability throughout Iraq. 
  In its letter, Iraq accused Van der Stoel of involvement in 
the political propaganda campaign aimed at dismembering Iraq 
geographically. The letter says: Max Van der Stoel's claims 
lack credibility and have premeditated hostile intentions 
against Iraq. 
  The letter says: The Kurdish people are part of the Iraqi 
people under any circumstances. The national authorities have 
continued to provide the northern governorates with rations just 
like the other Iraqi governorates. 
  The letter adds: The militias in the northern region, which 
are protected by the foreign forces there, steal these rations. 
They either sell them to citizens for double their regular 
price or smuggle them to neighboring states. 
  The letter strongly attacks Max Van der Stoel's calls for 
controlling human rights observers in Iraq, and says that the 
Iraqi Government categorically rejects this idea, especially 
since it flagrantly conflicts with the principles of 
sovereignty, independence, and noninterference. 
  The letter clarifies that Van der Stoel is trying to turn 
these observers into political agents for the colonialist 
states, and thus, he ignores the Iraqi state's responsibilities 
concerning sovereignty and independence. 
  The letter says: By his claims, Van der Stoel flagrantly 
violates two principles of the UN Charter; namely, the principle 
of noninterference in the affairs that constitute an essential 
part of the state's internal sovereignty, and the principle of 
respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.

  [Text] A Kurdish conference sponsored by the Russian 
authorities has sent a message to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin asking Moscow to establish official relations with the 
Kurdish movement based on their mutual interests. 
  Reporting this yesterday, the London-based AL-HAYAH 
newspaper 
said the Ankara government forwarded a protest to Moscow and 
asked for an explanation. 
  In this context, it has been announced in Ankara that the 
Turkish deputy foreign minister left for Moscow the day before 
yesterday to demand an official explanation. 
  The conference organized by numerous Kurdish groups in 
Moscow 
last week was held in cooperation with the Russian Ministry of 
Nationalities and Regional Policy Affairs under the theme 
"Kurdistan at a Historical and Political Crossroads."

  [Text] Referring to the agreement with the PLO, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that if the negotiations are 
resumed, we can reach an agreement within one month. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I was aware that Hamas and the 
Islamic Jihad on the Palestinian side will do everything to 
intensify terrorism and kill Israelis--and I stress Israelis, 
and my intention is Israeli Jews and non-Jews. Furthermore, I 
was aware that there is friction, and there was friction, with 
settlers, particularly with the most radical--the members of the 
Kakh and Kahane Hay groups and their supporters. But I admit it 
was difficult to imagine that such a hideous murder would be 
perpetrated by an Israeli--and what is more, one who wears a 
cap. I did not imagine that there would also be an Israeli 
Hamas or Jewish Hamas. I appeal to the Palestinians and their 
leadership in Tunis: I understand the pain and the anger. 
Don't allow a lone Jewish murderer who killed Palestinian 
Muslims just for being who they were, during prayers, to destroy 
the prospect for peace. [end recording]

  [Text] The United States is demanding that Israel detain 
scores of settlers from the hardline and extremist groups and 
hold them in administrative detention, our correspondent in 
Washington Arye Golan reports. The United States also thinks 
that Israel must disarm the settlers and supply them with light 
weapons for self-defense only. 
  These issues were scheduled to be raised in the preparatory 
talks of Nabil Sha'th with Dennis Ross, U.S. peace talks 
coordinator, and Martin Indyk, a member of the National Security 
Council, before Sha'th's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher this afternoon.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he has not 
received any official communication from the United States 
regarding the need to adopt further measures against the 
settlers. He said the government has decided to adopt measures 
against persons who are likely to constitute a threat. These 
measures include administrative detentions, transferring people 
from one place to another, and disarming people. Our 
correspondent Gil Litman reports that Minister Peres was 
speaking at the conclusion of a meeting with the EC 
representatives, the Greek foreign minister, and the

Israel is ready to come to terms with the Palestinians and 
supports the establishment of a strong Palestinian police. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz says Peres' statement 
apparently means that Israel is prepared to restrict the number 
of Palestinian policemen to more than 8,000. The prime minister 
has recently said that this is the figure that Israel has agrees 
to. 
  Regarding foreign presence in the territories, the foreign 
minister said Israel agrees to this according to the Declaration 
of Principles. In the foreign minister's opinion, it is 
possible to successfully conclude the negotiations with the 
Palestinians within one month. 
  Our correspondent adds that the situation in Russia was also 
discussed in the meeting.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the Labor Party 
is seeking to expand the coalition to increase the government's 
endurance capacity and its ability to conduct the peace 
negotiations. Minister Peres says that before his party can 
continue the negotiations with opposition parties to bring them 
into the government, it must discuss the matter first with its 
partners. 
  Labor Party leaders will meet this afternoon with Meretz 
ministers and will ask them to remove their opposition to 
Tzomet's inclusion in the coalition.

Temple Mount area and forces summoned to the area are removing 
the youths without using force. It is assumed that the youths 
are seeking to spend the night there in order to be among the 
many worshipers who arrive for Friday prayers tomorrow and for 
fear that the police will prevent youths from entering the

  [Text] The Israeli human rights organization, Betzelem, has 
sharply criticized the lethal gunfire used by the army to quell 
Palestinian riots. At a news conference in Jerusalem today, 
Betzelem said soldiers killed 21 Palestinian since the Hebron 
massacre. 
  In response, the government said soldiers were under orders 
to be restrained but found themselves in life-threatening 
situations. Steve Linde reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Linde] Betzelem says after the mosque 
massacre the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] (?streamed) large 
numbers of troops into heavily populated Palestinian areas and 
permitted them to use live fire against Palestinian 
demonstrators. Betzelem research director Yuwal Ginbar: 
  [Ginbar] It was found that during less than a week 21 
Palestinians and one Israeli were shot to death by Israeli 
security forces. This is an extremely large number. This stems 
from the fact that, right after the massacre, the army--instead 
of being moderate, instead of being tolerant, instead of letting 
the population express its anger and grief--went in with force 
to all the population centers, used heavily live ammunition in 
order to disperse crowds. And the result was the deaths, so 
many deaths. 
  [Linde] In response, the government says soldiers opened 
fire 
only when their lives were threatened. Government Press Office 
Director Uri Dromi: 
  [Dromi] Those soldiers were under danger for their life, and 
they had to open fire in order to rescue themselves from the 
situation. Needless to say, there were orders given to the 
soldiers in the beginning to try and restrain themselves--use 
the minimum fire possible--because we were all aware of the 
anger and the pain and the agony of the people. But, 
unfortunately, in this kind of loaded situation and strained 
environment, law and order must be maintained, and it is the 
duty of the army to do so. 
  [Linde] Betzelem called on the authorities to refrain from 
augmenting forces in Palestinian population centers and 
introducing troops not trained in riot control, and it urged the 
government to immediately halt all forms of collective 
punishment, such as curfews and closures.

  [Excerpts] Jerusalem, March 3 (AFP) -- Israeli troops shot 
and wounded more than 30 Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip on Thursday [3 March], but the level of violence was down 
from the previous days after the Hebron massacre. 
  Palestinian sources said 27 people were shot in the West 
Bank, including 10 in a clash between troops and demonstrators 
in the village of Nahalian near Bethlehem. 
  Seven Arabs were hit by army bullets in Gaza, they said. 
Also on the strip, an alleged collaborator with the Israelis 
was killed. PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's mainstream Fatah group 
claimed responsibility for the killing of Salim Alibani, who was 
40. [passage omitted] 
  The army also sealed off the territories on Sunday 
preventing 
70,000 Palestinians from reaching their jobs in Israel. The 
closure is to be enforced for another week, according to Israeli 
television. 
  Troops were on alert for Friday, the day of Moslem prayers 
and a week after the Hebron killings.

  [Text] The official committee formed to investigate the 
Hebron massacre held its first meeting this evening at the 
Higher Court building in the capital. 
  The purpose of the meeting was to make technical 
arrangements 
for the committee's work prior to its first public meetings next 
week. 
  Attorney Shomo'el Kassar has made an appeal to the Higher 
Court of Justice asking it to issue an order to prevent the 
official committee from beginning investigations into the 
criminal incident that took place at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. 
  The appeal said investigating this case is wholly rejected, 
since, to date, no committee of inquiry has been formed to 
investigate several bloody incidents against Jewish citizens. 
  Our legal affairs correspondent Moshe Matlih said Attorney 
Kassar attributes the formation of the committee to political 
reasons.

  [Text] There are serious disruptions in telephone service 
in the country. Many of the telephone lines have been 
disconnected by the striking Bezeq Company employees. Many of 
the problems and disconnections have been deliberately made by 
the company employees, the company's director general said this 
morning. The company will establish an inspection committee, 
and if employees are found to be guilty of malicious action 
against the telephone network, disciplinary and even judicial 
measures will be taken against them. 
  Meanwhile, our correspondent Meron Tzur reports that there 
are difficulties in dialing from inside and outside the country. 
This includes, among others, facsimile and some computer 
communications. Employees have returned to normal work only in 
the Haifa District and the north. The company is considering 
distributing back-to-work orders to the employees to ensure 
vital services. It is also awaiting an answer from the 
employees committee on a compromise proposal made last night.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "To Go On As If 'Arafat Was </F>
There"] 
  [Text] The ministers have been spreading themselves thin 
over all Israeli and foreign electronic and print media, 
desperately urging Yasir 'Arafat to return expeditiously to the 
negotiating table. The Hebron massacre increased Yitzhaq 
Rabin's dependence on the PLO leader and encouraged -- perhaps 
even forced -- 'Arafat to present some extraordinary demands 
which no responsible prime minister could accept, even under the 
heavy shadow of the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. 
  Disarm the settlers? This would be tantamount to leaving 
them there to be murdered by Palestinians. Deploy an 
international element in the territories? By the time of this 
was actually implemented, Israel would have been coerced into 
agreeing to an international presence that was far greater in 
scope and higher in status than the government could ever have 
imagined. Permit the Security Council to intervene in the 
political process? That would mean the collapse of the first of 
Israeli diplomacy's Ten Commandments. Or move the talks to 
Washington? This would indicate the end of all hope that the 
two nations at the center of the conflict could make their way 
through an agreement manufactured in the Middle East. 
  Even after the massacre, there are things Israel can offer 
to 
and trade with the PLO, but it has no option that will allow its 
government to take independent action designed to pressure 
'Arafat to stop stalling. 
  The debate on a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the 
territories seems to have died out with the signing of the 
Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles in September 1993. Who 
would want to be a solo dancer when two are willing to 
participate in this tango and when all the ministers firmly 
believe that this twosome is a prerequisite? 
  What we have now is not merely a new situation but also a 
new 
option. Under the present circumstances, Environment Minister 
Yosi Sarid, who participated in the political talks with the 
Palestinians, is willing to consider a combination of two 
approaches: Israel should make it clear to the PLO that it will 
not confront it with a fait accompli in the territories but will 
take steps toward a unilateral implementation of the nearly 
signed Israeli-Palestinian Gaza-Jericho agreement. Until now, 
Sarid had persistently opposed the idea of a unilateral 
withdrawal. 
  The difference here is substantial. Had the original 
unilateral withdrawal proposal been accepted, Israel would have 
announced the parameters of its withdrawal from the territories, 
the locations it was abandoning, and the dates. The present 
case is different. Warren Christopher stated last Tuesday that 
95 percent of the agreement on the first phase of autonomy has 
been completed. This can be used to threaten the PLO that 
Israel will implement the agreement even without it and that it 
had better seriously go about making practical preparations on 
the ground. 
  In practice, this would enable Israel to pull the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] out of these areas; to abolish the 
military-civilian bodies still operating there; to take labor- 
and economy-related steps in accordance with the agreements 
Avraham Shohat was about to finalize with Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad 
Quray']; and to make progress on some particularly difficult 
clauses in the agreement with the PLO, such as the Rafah and the 
Jordan River border crossings. 
  Israel can set up these border crossings in accordance with 
plans finalized in the Cairo talks and start operating them in 
the agreed manner. The Palestinian side of the crossings will 
remain vacant until 'Arafat decides to man it. The Israeli side 
of the crossing will be fully operational, and Israel will fill 
in for the Palestinians as long as they remain absent. 
  And what about the issues that have not been concluded? What 
kind of documents will the Palestinians issue? How will a mass 
influx of refugees into the territories be prevented? And 
mainly, how many square kilometers will the Jericho arrangement 
cover? 
  On these matters, Israel will do what it considers 
convenient 
but, at the same time, will stress that negotiations on them can 
resume at the exact point at which they were broken off. 
  Even those who opposed a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from 
the territories now realize that such a move will spur the PLO 
to return promptly to the negotiating path, lest Gaza and 
Jericho drop like ripe fruit into Hamas' [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] lap. 'Arafat may even be interested in receiving such 
a threat from the Israelis. 
  While a decisive step of this kind will exacerbate the 
dispute with the right-wing opposition, we must admit -- 
embarrassing as it is -- that it is easier to go through any 
national soul-searching under the new circumstances than in any 
other political scenario. At this time, it is hard for the 
settlers to recruit even part of the Likud, the NRP [National 
Religious Party], and Tzomet for an effective opposition. 
  In addition, the present climate offers a secondary gain. 
Rabin, who has been refusing to uproot a single Israeli 
settlement, was unable to do it under a pressure from and for 
the sake of the PLO; but should he come to terms with himself, 
even border adjustments in Netzarim, Tall al-Rumaythah, and 
Hebron's Bet Hadassah are not impossible -- on condition that 
the government wants it with all its heart and has the necessary 
political and personal energy.

  [Text] Members of the Jordanian delegation to the 
Jordanian-Israeli peace talks have returned to Amman from 
Washington. Delegation member Marwan Dudin said the delegation's 
return came in the wake of a Jordanian decision, in coordination 
with the other Arab parties, on suspending the current round of 
negotiations as part of the manifestations of protest and anger 
that prevailed among the official and popular circles in Jordan 
following the savage massacre against the worshipers at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque last Friday. 
  The decision to suspend the negotiations was made at the 
government's instructions after holding intensive Arab contacts.

  He told Jordan Television that he will discuss with 
Jordanian 
officials current conditions in the Middle East in the wake of 
the Hebron massacre. He said the most pressing issue now is to 
maintain the momentum of the peace process. 
  The Greek foreign minister added that the European Union 
believes that a demand by the Palestinians in the occupied lands 
for international protection is just one.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
at the Prime Ministry this morning Karolos Papoulias, Greek 
foreign minister and chairman of the European Community [EC] 
Council of Ministers, and the delegation accompanying him. 
  Their discussion dealt with bilateral relations and the 
existing cooperation between Jordan and the EC countries, ways 
of enhancing them, as well as the most important issues in the 
international arena. 
  In a press statement on the most important ideas he 
communicated to the Israeli leaders on behalf of the Palestinian 
president, Papoulias said: These ideas revolve around calming 
the atmosphere and creating a new atmosphere that would 
facilitate things, provide security for the Palestinians, and 
lead to disarming the settlers and resuming the dialogue between 
the two sides. He said that the Israeli side has promised to 
take these ideas into consideration and will reply to them 
later. He said: Efforts will be exerted in the future and the 
EC hopes that the peace efforts will produce good results and 
will not reach a dead end. 
  The meeting was attended by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister 
of state for foreign affairs; Dr. Fawwaz Abu-al-Ghanam, minister 
of state; the Jordanian ambassador to Greece; the Greek 
ambassador to Jordan; and the EC representative in Amman.

  [Text] The Jordanian side, led by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, and the Greek side, led 
by Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and the current 
chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, held a session of talks 
at the Foreign Ministry this morning. 
  The two sides addressed friendly bilateral relations and 
ways 
of enhancing them, as well as relations with the EC. They also 
discussed the latest developments in the region and in the peace 
process. 
  Al-Hasan stressed the deep relations of friendship and 
cooperation between Jordan and both Greece and the EC. The 
special relations King Husayn has with European leaders have 
contributed a great deal to developing these relations. 
  Al-Hasan reviewed the developments in the peace process and 
Jordan's important, pivotal role through its constant calls for 
achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. He also 
reviewed the tremendous, courageous efforts His Majesty King 
Husayn has made to advance the peace process toward its 
objectives in line with Resolutions 242 and 338 and the 
foundations of international legitimacy on which it was 
launched. These foundations are represented in Israel's 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, ensuring the 
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national 
soil, ensuring Jordan's rights to territory and water, and 
resolving the problem of the refugees. 
  Al-Hasan pointed out that Jordan has borne great burdens as 
a 
result of the repercussions of the Arab-Israeli dispute, the 
Gulf crisis, and its reception of successive waves of emigrants 
resulting from these crises -- including one in 1948, another in 
1967, and ending with the Gulf crisis in 1991. This is in 
addition to the indebtedness and other financial burdens it has 
borne in this context. 
  Al-Hasan noted the difficulties Jordan is facing as a result 
of the siege imposed on the Gulf of 'Aqabah, despite Jordan's 
commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  Al-Hasan also briefed the guest on Jordan's democratic 
process and the eagerness of the leadership and the people to 
perpetuate and develop it in line with the principles of rule by 
the Constitution and legislation and respect for human rights. 
  Minister al-Hasan noted his appreciation for the support and 
aid that the EC states have extended to Jordan and the region, 
as well as the EC's efforts to promote the peace process, 
particularly the multi-party negotiations. He also appreciated 
the EC's sponsorship of the economic development working group. 
He expressed hope that this aid will increase to enable Jordan 
to continue its important role in the peace process. 
  The two sides also discussed the hideous massacre that the 
Israeli settlers committed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque during 
the dawn prayers last Friday in the blessed month of Ramadan. 
They emphasized their condemnation of this criminal act and 
stressed the need to provide the necessary protection for the 
Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. They also 
stressed the need to disarm the settlers, and the importance of 
speeding up the achievement of a comprehensive peace that will 
end the regional conflict. 
  For his part, the guest minister stressed the deep ties of 
friendship between Jordan and both his country and the EC 
states. Thanks to His Majesty King Husayn, these relations were 
established and consolidated through his strong friendly 
relations with their leaders, he said. The guest minister also 
said he appreciated his majesty's wise policy and courageous 
positions in support of a peace that will be accepted by the 
coming generations. 
  The guest minister also stressed his understanding of the 
economic difficulties and burdens Jordan is facing as a result 
of its commitment to the peace process. He also noted 
appreciation for the important role Jordan is playing to serve 
the causes of peace, and stressed the need to support Jordan to 
continue this role. He lauded the democratic experience Jordan 
is living. 
  The two sides reviewed relations between Greece [as heard] 
and the European states and the ways to consolidate and promote 
them in various fields. In this regard, the two sides noted 
their good bilateral political relations and the need to expand 
this in the economic, cultural, tourist, air transport, and 
other fields. 
  Regarding relations with the EC states, the two sides agreed 
on the importance of convening the Jordanian-European Commission 
Joint Cooperation Council as soon as possible.

  [Excerpts] Amman, 3 Mar (PETRA)--Planning Minister Dr. 
Ziyad Fariz today received Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign 
minister and chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, and his 
delegation. 
  Dr. Fariz reviewed the challenges Jordan is facing in the 
current phase, the circumstances prevailing in the region, the 
economic measures Jordan has adopted, and the achievements it 
has realized. He also reviewed the repercussions of the Gulf 
crisis, including the decline in Jordanian exports to the Gulf 
states and the reduced demand for Jordanian workers in these 
states. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Fariz noted his appreciation for the EC aid to Jordan, 
and urged the EC to further support Jordan in the economic field 
in order to fill the 1994 financial gap and alleviate the burden 
of the general indebtedness. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Fariz also reviewed Jordanian-Greek relations in the 
economic, trade, technical, and cultural fields based on the 
bilateral cooperation agreement signed in 1976. He discussed 
with the guest minister ways to activate bilateral cooperation 
by establishing joint food and agricultural industries, and 
holding meetings between businessmen from both countries to 
explore new ideas and promote cooperation in various fields. 
  The guest minister noted the extent of identity between the 
objectives of the Jordanian development plans and those which 
the EC is seeking to achieve in order to encourage 
competitiveness and fight both unemployment and poverty. He 
said he highly appreciated the great efficiency Jordan is 
enjoying in the field of economic and other policies. He noted 
that Jordan will be supported by the EC in various fields.

  [Text] Karolos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and 
chairman of the EC Council of Ministers, left Amman this evening 
following a two-day visit to Jordan. During the visit, he met 
with His Majesty King Husayn and several senior Jordanian 
officials. 
  In press statements, Papoulias said that the EC understands 
His Majesty King Husayn's great role, and fully understands both 
Jordan's needs and the necessity of extending aid to it after it 
has sustained damages as a result of the Gulf war and the 
inspections in the port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Papoulias added that he conveyed to King Husayn a letter of 
thanks and appreciation from the EC for his majesty's role in 
the reconciliation among Yemeni leaders. Asked about the 
possibility of requesting the EC to disarm the Israeli settlers 
in the occupied Arab territories, Papoulias said: There is a 
joint declaration by the EC. We believe we can push this 
request forward. He noted that an appropriate atmosphere should 
be created to resume the peace negotiations by pooling various 
efforts. 
  Papoulias said that after ending his regional tour on 
Sunday, 
he will head for Brussels to meet with his EC colleagues in 
order to brief them on the outcome of his tour. He expressed 
hope that the EC will take new initiatives on the region in 
order to promote the peace process. 
  Asked whether it is possible to convince Israel to allow the 
deployment of international troops in the occupied Arab 
territories to protect the civilians there, Papoulias said: We 
will seriously discuss this problem. An alternative solution 
would be to send international observers, so we can secure the 
resumption of the peace negotiations and dialogue. We will also 
discuss various ways and means to guarantee security for the 
Palestinians. 
  Papoulias was seen off at Amman airport by Talal Sat'an 
al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs; the Jordanian 
ambassador to Greece; and the Greek ambassador in Amman.

  [Text] The House of Representatives has denounced the 
criminal bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najah church in fraternal 
Lebanon. In a statement, the House said that it views the 
killing of innocent people and attacks on places of worship as 
criminal acts that are a disgrace to human civilization. These 
acts also violate all international norms, laws, and legitimacy, 
the statement noted. 
  At the same time, the House emphasized that this criminal 
incident indicates that the tampering and criminal hands do not 
want fraternal Lebanon to restore its well-being and stability, 
the statement said. Just as in the case of the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque, these hands wanted Lebanon to be an arena for 
destruction and bloodshed. This confirms that the sinful hands, 
which committed the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, were 
the same hands that targeted the lives of innocent people at the 
Sayyidat al-Najah church, and that they only carried out this 
act to overshadow the massacre they committed in Hebron, the 
statement noted. 
  Greetings to the Lebanese Government and people, and may God 
preserve Lebanon as an oasis of security and safety and as a 
supporter of its Arab nation, the statement added.

  [Excerpts] Labor Minister Khalid al-Ghizawi has chaired a 
meeting comprising an International Labor Organization [ILO] 
fact-finding team and representatives of the Royal Committee for 
Jerusalem Affairs, the Palestinian Affairs Department, the Amman 
Chamber of Industry, the Trade Union Federation, and the Union 
of the Chambers of Commerce at the meetings hall in the Ministry 
of Labor. 
  During the meeting, the labor minister delivered a statement 
urging the ILO to implement the decisions made by the 
international labor conferences in 1974 and 1980. These 
decisions call for extending all forms of aid to the Palestinian 
people and their labor forces in order to support their 
steadfastness on their land. [passage omitted] 
  Minister al-Ghizawi noted the inhumane policy that Israel is 
pursuing in the occupied Arab territories. He said: We in 
Jordan only recognize the sovereignty of God Almighty over the 
Islamic holy places. He also pointed to Israel's policy, which 
aims to Judaize Jerusalem, and, consequently, complete the 
greater Jerusalem project. The minister added that Jordan 
condemns and vehemently denounces all forms of Judaization, and 
urges the international bodies to intervene in order to protect 
the mosques and churches, so that they will be outside the 
framework of the bloody conflict. 
  He said that Jordan also demands a halt to the building of 
Israeli settlements, the disarming of the settlers, and a total 
transfer of the settlers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

  [Text] A group calling itself the Islamic Battalions 
[al-kata'ib al-islamiyah] has threatened revenge for the martyrs 
of Palestine. The group said that hardline Islamists in Egypt 
will begin to attack the Americans and Israelis. 
  Carrying the report, REUTER said that the group made the 
threat in a statement seemingly faxed from Beirut. The 
statement gave the Americans in Egypt 48 hours to leave the 
country. The statement said: We warn every American in Egypt 
that he will be a target for the Islamist mujahidin in the 
country. 
  The group claimed responsibility for a device exploding in 
front of the Egyptian American Bank in Cairo last night. 
  The Islamic Group in Egypt earlier claimed responsibility 
for 
the same explosion as well as for recent attacks against banks 
and policemen in Egypt.

<F P=106> [Khayrallah Khayrallah article: "Between Two Massacres"] </F>
  [Text] At first glance, one cannot but link the Zuq 
Mikha'il church massacre in Lebanon to the al-Ibrahimi mosque 
massacre in Hebron committed by a Jewish "fundamentalist" with 
the clear participation of others who believe that there is no 
possibility of coexistence between the peoples of the region and 
that there is only room for extremism, extremists, and 
continuation of violence. 
  Of course, the timing of the church explosion appeared to be 
the best service to Israel because the crime committed in 
Lebanon provided the best evidence that there are "extremists" 
everywhere and that the ugly act committed against the 
worshippers in Hebron was part of the wider framework of 
imbalance in the region, a condition which made the peace 
process possible just as it made those opposed to the process 
resort to exceptional ways of fighting it. And so in the end it 
would appear that violence and terrorism are features of a 
general condition prevailing in the region, that what happened 
at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was an integral part of that 
condition, and that Israel itself will have to face the problem 
of its "fundamentalism" just as in the case of a good number of 
states in the region such as Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. 
  Such an argument appears to be solid and logical, but what 
is 
required is an understanding of the Lebanese situation, which 
must be viewed from a special angle because that small country 
is in the process of rebuilding itself after its government 
moved it out of the intensive care unit to pave the way for 
laying the foundations of a state and institutions that would 
take it healthily to the year 2000 and beyond. Lebanon is 
currently in labor. The Zuq Mikha'il church explosion cannot be 
isolated from the attempt to assassinate Christian clergy on 
their way to the al-Balamand monastery, the explosion at the 
Phalangist headquarters in al-Sayfi in the heart of Beirut on 
new year's eve last year, or the sectarian leaflets distributed 
at the time and the explosions which accompanied that in stores 
in various areas. All that was in the context of undermining 
the process of redrafting an integral national plan for Lebanon 
taking into consideration the fact that there is a need to 
rectify matters, particularly the injustice inflicted on the 
Christians in general after they were dragged into a "suicidal" 
plan and then into boycotting the latest parliamentary 
elections. That does not mean that other parties, such as 
Syria, do not bear any responsibility in the context of settling 
scores with certain leaderships to the point of deliberately 
humiliating them even if that means making a large number of 
Lebanese people feel that they are the "oppressed" group indeed. 
  It is easy to accuse Israel of being the party behind the 
church explosion to divert attention from the al-Ibrahimi mosque 
massacre, but it is difficult to admit that certain groups in 
Lebanon, while pretending to be fighting Israel, actually in 
practice serve the policy of the Jewish state. They do so by 
seeking to sabotage the national basic program being implemented 
by the Lebanese Government at all levels beginning with the 
reconstruction of Beirut and reviving it as a civilized city in 
which people enjoy living together, not just a place of 
coexistence between the Lebanese themselves and Arab brothers 
and foreigners, and by pursuing a policy of terrorizing the 
Christians to block any attempt to restore political balance in 
the country. 
  The main question remains: What is the position of the 
Syrian leadership on everything happening in Lebanon? Can 
Damascus continue to play the game of maintaining certain 
balances in the country through its ability to use "the 
extremists" and their practices in the framework of its regional 
policy? Finally, the church explosion must be seen as a blow to 
Syrian security in Lebanon. What will Damascus do? Will it 
continue to play the waiting game knowing that any weakening of 
Lebanon is ultimately a weakening of Syria and its ability to 
face Israel with a minimum degree of Arab coordination.

<F P=106> ["In Broad Daylight" column by Rajih al-Khuri: "The </F>
Massacre"] 
  [Text] Israel has brought together the necessary elements 
and created the right possibilities for the "Palestinian 
massacre." 
  It is not possible to explain in any other way the order the 
Israeli Army received to prepare for speedy withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  Despite the progress the negotiations are making between the 
Palestinian and Israeli committees, even if on the "basis of 
crumbs" which constitutes a prominent element in the strategy of 
Israeli negotiation, the rush to evacuate Gaza and Jericho 
before the set date of 13 April is nothing less than a time-bomb 
the Israelis are planting under the feet of the PLO and Hamas. 
  Before discussing the reasons behind this upcoming massacre, 
we need to recall the many Israeli voices that during the past 
two years have not stopped demanding that the ball of fire be 
thrown in the lap of the Palestinians and the occasional 
official calls for evacuating the terrorist mire in reference to 
the Gaza Strip, where the stone revolution has not abated. 
  This was before reaching the autonomy agreement on 13 April 
1993, and before the agreement and the detailed talks it 
stipulates between the two sides reached the point of no return, 
as Shim'on Peres says. 
  And now, there is no escape from moving forward, even if the 
road is a field of knives, at least for Yasir 'Arafat who cannot 
go backwards even though he is shaking politically every time he 
makes progress. 
  He is a prisoner of this iron wager that is imposed by the 
talks. It has led not only to denuding him of all the slogans, 
papers, and maneuvers, but also of his own skin, not to mention 
his head. 
  What does he have in hand other than the "autonomy" 
agreement 
which can barely be seen with the naked eye, especially since 
the area of Gaza and Jericho that will come under the autonomy 
is no bigger than the Fatah-land 'Arafat reigned over in 
Lebanon, and especially since his authority in that area, which 
constitutes an amplified form of the Ansar detention camp, is no 
more than the authority of a taxi driver from Sabra during the 
days of "the Palestinian mandate" over Sabra camp. 
  It is autonomy on paper only. In practice, a reading of the 
agreement's articles regarding the crossings for example, is 
enough for a person entering Gaza and Jericho to realize that 
the Hebrew stamps have been imprinted not only on his passport, 
but on his forehead, and perhaps even his brain. 
  Therefore, what can 'Arafat offer the Hamas people, the 
rejectionists, the extremists, and those calling for jihad? 
What can he tell them? What can he promise them for the 
future, when he has nothing but this present? How will he keep 
the peace, with whom, and on what basis? 
  It is clear that it is too early for Rabin's government to 
call on 'Arafat to bear his responsibilities in combating 
terrorism as soon as possible. The day before yesterday, 
Israeli radio said that "Palestinian policemen" should be 
deployed in the Gaza Strip as a vanguard force at the end of 
this week. 
  We need to remember that pistols have taken the place of 
batons in the hands of the autonomy police as the result of a 
strong request from Shim'on Peres, since clubs are not enough to 
confront the Islamic resistance movement. 
  While the PLO is paying attention to training and preparing 
its policemen, Israel was setting the bloody stage with great 
care. Yasir 'Arafat himself a few days ago protested "that a 
terrible trade in arms is taking place under the supervision of 
Israeli forces in Gaza and Jericho. I believe that this has 
been seriously planned. They know that these weapons will not 
be used against them after they withdraw. So, who will they be 
used against? It is a very dangerous game if they are planning 
to create a new Afghanistan among the Palestinians." 
  The issue does not need 'Arafat's testimony, nor does it 
need 
the publicly declared fears that were expressed by Abu-'Ali 
Shahin, the official responsible for the Gaza Strip, who said 
that the pro-Likud Shin Bet is drowning the people with weapons 
and plotting to start a civil war among the Palestinians. 
  The issue does not need all these testimonies. It needs sane 
and careful thinking, not because the Palestinians do not have 
anything but this single chance to prove their competence, even 
within the framework of the autonomy and under the Israeli 
microscope, but because the Palestinian massacre will return 
Gaza and Jericho to Israeli rule upon a request from the 
Palestinians themselves. At this point, there are many lessons 
the residents of Gaza and Jericho need to learn. 
  They need to learn first for their own sakes, and maybe for 
the sake of others. This is because negotiations on the Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks could turn a full and empty circle waiting 
for what will happen to the Palestinians. 
  If things continue this way, the "full partner" in the peace 
process will naturally be the good successor of President Bill 
Clinton. 
  And may God help everyone.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In an editorial today, AL-BA'TH says: One can 
deduce from the Israeli conduct that there is a new attempt not 
only to circumvent the results of the Geneva summit, but also to 
circumvent the U.S. role and all the international efforts 
seeking to achieve the just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses the importance of having a balanced and 
effective European role in the peace process. However, the 
paper warns that the Israelis' emphasis on the Europeans, from 
the economic viewpoint, seeks to market the Oslo Agreement, in 
which some people found an opportunity to enter the region. The 
paper says: This view is based on a host of unfounded 
illusions, which will harm principally the peace process and the 
Europeans themselves, in view of their interests in the region 
and strong ties with the Arab states. The paper wonders: Will 
the European Community agree to serve as a bridge on which Rabin 
can cross to hamper the peace process? 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel has on more than one 
occasion tried to use the European role to its advantage. But 
that role remained balanced to some extent over the issue of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. With Rabin's moves, which precede his 
visit to Washington, this role should not lose its balance 
because the wager on the Oslo Agreement will fail.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Thirty Syrian Deputies Call </F>
on Turkey To Stop War Against Kurds"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- In a significant development, Syrian 
People's Assembly members have called on Ankara to stop its 
military operations against the Kurds in Turkish Kurdistan. The 
deputies, about 30 of them, believe that the Turkish Army is 
waging an undeclared war on the Kurdish people by burning and 
destroying their towns and villages. In a memorandum, a copy of 
which was obtained by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the deputies said that 
the Turkish special forces were "hunting, persecuting, and 
killing Kurdish patriots," and that "successive Turkish 
governments since the Ottoman reign have continuously ignored 
the existence of the Kurdish people in a foolish policy that has 
failed to obliterate the Kurdish national identity." 
  The Syrian deputies also called on the Turkish Government to 
work for a just and peaceful solution to the issue of the 
Kurdish and Turkish peoples and establish links of coexistence 
between them. The Syrian parliamentarians accused the Turkish 
Government of imposing a terrorist fait accompli in the Kurdish 
areas. 
  The Syrian deputies addressed their memorandum to Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel, National Assembly Speaker Husamettin 
Cindoruk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. It was handed to the 
Turkish ambassador in Damascus at the embassy premises. In that 
memorandum, the deputies said that reports carried by news 
agencies and the Turkish media about the military operations 
carried out by the Turkish Army in the east and southeast of 
Turkey (Kurdistan) confirm that "what the Army is doing is 
tantamount to an undeclared war against the Kurdish people and 
that the police and gendarmerie forces are imposing an 
unbearable situation of terror in the Kurdish areas where 
patriotic and social figures are liquidated in broad daylight in 
public." 
  The memorandum added that "this chauvinistic military and 
political campaign by the Turkish Government is producing 
terrifying results for the Kurdish population, a matter which 
arouses extreme concern among members of the Syrian People's 
Assembly and all peace- and justice-loving people. It runs 
contrary to the principles of democracy and human rights which 
Turkish officials claim to respect and abide by." 
  The memorandum urged Turkey to stop the military operations 
and work for a peaceful solution because that would save it 
money and blood and would enhance the links of coexistence 
between the two peoples, and it would also place Turkey among 
the civilized states and strengthen its role and position in the 
eyes of the world public opinion. 
  The deputies added: "The only way to resolve peoples' issues 
is dialogue and mutual understanding on the basis of recognition 
of the national rights of the oppressed people." 
  It is worth noting that Syrian-Turkish relations often 
passed 
through political crises because of the position of the Kurdish 
fighters and the water issue which is still pending between the 
two countries. Turkey has always hinted at using the water 
weapon because of what Turkey claims to be Syrian support for 
the fighters of the Kurkish Workers Party, but Syria has 
repeatedly and categorically denied these charges. 
  In their official statements, however, the two countries 
reaffirm their satisfaction with the rapid and positive 
development of their relations and their intention to further 
expand these relations in all fields. The two sides have also 
expressed satisfaction with the positive developments over the 
past months regarding security issues pertaining to the long 
borders between them, as a result of the spirit of cooperation 
which has been confirmed and enhanced by the exchange of visits 
between the interior and foreign ministers of the two countries 
during which it was reaffirmed that any activity on the 
territory of either of them harmful to the security of that 
country would not be allowed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
has said the carnage in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron could be 
repeated elsewhere. Observers took this statement as an 
implicit threat to the Palestinian people whose intifadah has 
flared up and encompassed all cities, villages, and camps of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip and extended even to the 1948-occupied 
territories. 
  The truth is that the Israeli prime minister is just as 
responsible for the horrendous massacre as the Zionist settlers 
who carried out the treacherous attack. Rabin is the one who 
armed the settlers and gave them a free hand to commit 
aggression in the occupied territories. He also refused, after 
the massacre, to take deterrent measures to check the settlers' 
activities and disarm them. Instead of punishing the war 
criminals and bloody killers, he imposed a collective punishment 
on the entire Palestinian people, subjected all of the occupied 
territories to military siege, and instructed the occupation 
troops to shoot indiscriminately. As a consequence, more than 
20 martyrs from our Arab people have fallen in the wake of the 
savage massacre. Dozens more were wounded. The list is 
increasing everyday, and suppression is on the rise. 
  Rabin is indeed preparing for further massacres, since he 
insists on incorporating the Zionist extremist Tzomet Party into 
the government coalition and letting the well-known terrorist 
and bloody leader of the Tzomet Party, Refa'el Eytan, take over 
the Police Ministry. 
  Eytan is one of the most extremist Zionists. He is the one 
who advocated mass expulsions of the Arabs and committing savage 
massacres against them to drive them to emigrate immediately. 
Therefore, the international community should take Rabin's 
threats seriously and provide protection for the Palestinian 
people in line with the Geneva Conventions and international 
charters and principles. 
  By issuing such threats and making them a reality, Rabin not 
only seeks to severely harm the Palestinian people, but also to 
deliver a fatal blow to the Middle East peace process, entrench 
occupation, and pursue schemes to Judaize the occupied Arab 
territories and plant them with settlements. 
  We do not believe any of the influential parties on the 
Security Council are unaware that the massacre has done great 
damage to the peace process and that any new massacre will 
undermine the peace process in its entirety. We also do not 
believe that a single Security Council member is unaware that 
Zionist settlers constitute a stumbling block to the achievement 
of peace. A just and comprehensive solution in the Middle East 
is impossible without the return of all the occupied Arab 
territories, the evacuation of the settlers, and the Palestinian 
people's guaranteed right to exercise their national rights, 
foremost being their right to self- determination. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has again highlighted certain 
facts that some people have forgotten or chosen to disregard. 
One of these facts is that peace is impossible under occupation 
and cannot coexist with settlement activity. Therefore, the 
Security Council, which is discussing the question of this 
region, is asked to assert the need for a full Israeli 
withdrawal and for the evacuation the settlers and the 
dismantling of the settlements in line with international 
resolutions. These resolutions have always rejected occupation, 
the acquisition of territory by force, settlement activity, and 
Judaization of the land. 
  Today, peace depends on a decisive international stand and 
true international credibility. Current and past events have 
shown that the international community cannot continue to 
disregard the reality of Zionist occupation and give the 
criminal hand of Zionism a free rein in the occupied 
territories. This would be an outright violation of 
international charters and UN principles and would undermine the 
peace process that has so far drowned in Arab blood shed at the 
hands of Israel, its troops, and settlers. 
  The Arabs, who responded to the U.S. peace initiative and 
accommodated all Security Council resolutions, have only reaped 
bitterness and frustration. Such a situation is no longer 
acceptable by Arab governments or by the Arab man in the street. 
Unless effective international measures are taken to implement 
the Security Council resolutions, effect the return the occupied 
Arab territories, and ensure the liberation of the Palestinian 
people from Zionist terrorism and oppression, the peace process 
is liable to collapse into oblivion.

  [Text] Delhi police have arrested six persons and foiled a 
well-planned conspiracy for creating widespread disturbances in 
India by Pakistan-trained militants. Briefing newsmen in New 
Delhi today, the city police commissioner, Mr. N.B. Kaushal, 
disclosed that they had planned to create disturbances, attack 
religious places, and use poison. He said it is for the first 
time that Pakistan used its own nationals for such operations 
who are trained and experienced in guerrilla warfare and 
insurgency. Sixteen kg of explosives, detonators, hand 
grenades, and Pakistani passports were seized from the arrested 
persons who belong to the Islamic Inqilabi Mahaz [Revolutionary 
Front]. Two sets of floppies were also seized from the 
terrorists, who were planning to prepare a computer. Cases 
against them have been registered, and they were remanded to 
police custody.

  [Text] The home minister has reiterated that nobody can 
question the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India. Mr. S.B. 
Chavan also said that Washington should get its facts clear and 
should stop meddling in the internal affairs of the country. He 
told the Rajya Sabha today during the zero hour that he stands 
by his statement on the subject made in the Lok Sabha on 
Wednesday. Mr. Chavan pointed out that it was India which moved 
the United Nations as a complainant following the naked 
aggression of Pakistan on Kashmir.

  [Text] India has sought closer cooperation of the European 
Union and the United States in dealing with Pakistan's 
resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission meeting 
in Geneva. The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, 
told the envoys of the European troika and the U.S. charge d' 
affaires in New Delhi today that neither the letter nor the 
spirit of the Pakistan resolution is acceptable to New Delhi. 
It will also not help in improving the situation in Jammu and 
Kashmir as it is the direct result of the Pakistan-sponsored 
terrorism. He asked them to convey India's position on the 
Pakistan resolution and hoped that the delegations of these 
countries will work closely with the Indian delegation in 
Geneva. The meeting was held at the request of the envoys.

Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights 
Commission meeting in Geneva. The visiting Polish foreign 
minister, Mr. (Andrzej Olechowski), gave this assurance in his 
talks with the external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, in

special emphasis to its relations with India and wants to 
strengthen the economic ties. 
  Mr. Dinesh Singh briefed him about Pakistan's attempt to 
internationalize the Kashmir issue under the guise of raising 
human rights issue. Pakistan's own record in this area is 
abysmal. Mr. Dinesh Singh said the political process in Jammu 
and Kashmir can easily begin if Pakistan stops aiding and 
abetting terrorism in the state. 
  Both also discussed the ongoing reforms in the UN system and 
called for making it more democratic.

  [Text] India and Poland have called for further 
strengthening economic cooperation in the wake of changes in 
both the countries. Speaking at a banquet hosted in honor of the 
visiting Polish president, Mr. Lech Walesa, in New Delhi last 
night, President Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, said a sense of 
identity and affinity marks the multi-dimensional growth of ties 
between the two countries. Describing Mr. Walesa's personal 
contribution to Polish revolution as significant, Dr. Sharma 
said the dramatic changes in Poland over the last decade acted 
as an important catalyst in ending the Cold War and 
fundamentally transforming international relations. 
  Reciprocating the sentiments, Mr. Walesa lauded India's 
efforts toward ending the arms race and eliminating the threat 
of nuclear warfare. Turning to the economic front, Mr Walesa 
said there is great scope for increasing trade between the two 
countries and the potential in both the countries should be 
fully exploited. 
  The Polish president also met the vice president, Mr. K.R. 
Narayanan, and stressed the need to project Mahatma Gandhi's 
ideas and values for shaping the new world order.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace in Palestine Still a Mirage"] </F>
  [Text] The latest hope for peace in Palestine was shattered 
yesterday when a "lone" Israeli gunman sprayed Muslim 
worshippers at the tomb of the Patriarch in Hebron killing more 
than 30 Palestinians and injuring dozens more. 
  Israeli security force also did their bit by killing at 
least 
another 18 Palestinians and wounding many more when they fired 
into the crowds gathered at hospitals to donate blood and show 
support for their fellow countrymen. 
  The U.S.-brokered agreement between the Zionists and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) for an autonomous 
Palestinian administration in Gaza and Jericho, is now 
christened in blood. The PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat issued a 
statement saying the massacre could have "very serious 
fallout... at all levels," and his organization declared a 
3-day strike in Gaza in memory of the dead. 
  'Arafat is not the only party to blame for this massacre, 
nevertheless he must take the major share of responsibility for 
this tragedy because his cooperation with the Zionist entity and 
its American handlers gave some Palestinians the impression that 
the usurper Zionists could be trusted and that peace may be 
achieved simply by taking the Zionists and the Americans on face 
falue. 
  Throughout their 45 years of occupying Palestine, the 
Israelis have claimed that their security agencies are the best 
in the world and have often criticized other countries' security 
systems. It would take a great deal of faith to believe that 
this massacre was purely a coincidence and the work of a "lone" 
crazed Jewish fanatic. Hopefully, later investigations will 
clarify questions regarding the slow response of the Zionists to 
this massacre, as well as the reason why nearly 20 more unarmed 
Palestinians were slaughtered by Israel's security officers. 
  Israel is just buying time until its lobby in U.S. Congress 
can once again convince congressmen of Israel's strategic value 
to America. After the fall of Communism the American Israel 
Political Action Committee (AIPAC) lost some credibility among 
Americans. AIPAC's perennial argument that Israel, as the "only 
democracy in the region," and as a bastion of anti-Islamic 
ideology in Muslim Middle East is no longer valid due to the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the gradual realization 
by the U.S. that Islam can not be defeated by Israeli 
conspiracies and lies. 
  It is for the people of Palestine to draw their own 
conclusions from this latest Zionist atrocity. But logic, 
common sense, and the past behavior of Zionists tell us that the 
Israelis, despite their peaceful utterances, have no desire for 
peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani, adviser to the </F>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by an unidentified correspondent in 
Tehran on 3 March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Greetings, dear listeners. I 
hope you are well. As you know, last Friday the Zionists 
attacked the shrine of his holiness Abraham, peace be upon him, 
and martyred a number of fasting Muslim Palestinians who were 
saying their prayers. The subject of this program is to 
investigate the dimensions of this great catastrophe. His 
excellency Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani is the esteemed guest of 
this program. During the course of this program, we will 
benefit from his views. [passage omitted] 
  As my last question, at the beginning of our discussion, you 
referred to countries such as Lebanon or Syria. What will be 
the external effects of the massacre on Arab countries, such as 
the countries you mentioned or on Jordan--in view of the fact 
that those countries have announced that they will not take part 
in the peace talks? 
  [Larijani] In my view, the first repercussion will come from 
inside. 'Arafat has completely lost his credibility for the 
talks. On one level, this means that all the peace talks have 
been delivered such a blow that, in my view, they cannot be 
revived. Of course, it is possible that they may hold two or 
three meetings and such like. However, to Israel the 
suppression of the intifadah is the precondition for any peace. 
Therefore, peace talks suffered a major defeat as a whole, the 
intensity of which was not predicted by any of the countries 
that took part in the peace talks. The Islamic Republic was the 
only country that rejected the talks from the start and 
predicted their failure. 
  I believe that a much stronger resistance has started 
against 
the peace talks throughout the Islamic world. It is clear that 
this resistance will influence the political leaders. Perhaps, 
if the political leaders of the Islamic world pay attention, 
this is the best opportunity to at least pay careful attention 
for once to the basic issue of peace and security instead of to 
all the lies that have been spoken about peace. The real basis 
of this peace and security will be to change the regime in the 
occupied territories. The regime is, in essence, an illegal, 
racist, and aggressive regime. 
  [Correspondent] And against human rights? 
  [Larijani] Yes, and against human rights. It has the worst 
record as a racist country, even when compared to the regimes of 
South Africa or the former Zimbabwe. Therefore, let us talk 
about the real, basic issue. Let us talk about a regime in 
which Muslims, Christian, and Jews all live freely and enjoy 
equal civil rights. Such a new regime will be the cure for the 
present problems. No peace will be possible without it. I 
believe that, under present conditions, the Islamic 
Republic--while continuing its strong support on the 
international scene for Islamic movements in the occupied 
territories--should also present new ideas for the solution of 
the problems. Those ideas should also be based on the evolution 
of a regime--the changing of the present aggressive regime to a 
legal regime that ensures equal rights for all. If that idea is 
realized, I believe that it would be one of the best fruits of 
the Islamic resistance for the Muslims, for Christians, and even 
in the future for the Jews. This will be a very important 
outcome. 
  [Correspondent] Once again, I thank you for your 
participation in this program. 
  [Larijani] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Despite the Zionist regime's futile efforts to calm 
down the Palestinian uprising, anti-Zionist demonstrations 
continue in the occupied territories. Since the massacre of 
fasting worshipers in the al-Khalil mosque, the Zionist regime 
has resorted to a policy of suppression and persuasion in a bid 
to limit reaction to the tragedy inside occupied Palestine. 
However, these policies have not yielded the results that Tel 
Aviv wished. 
  The Zionist regime's decision to release 500 more 
Palestinian 
political prisoners yesterday, as well as the disarming of some 
extremist Palestinian [as heard] groups and the payment of 
compensation to the families of the martyrs of the tragedy at 
the Ibrahimi shrine, are among the persuasive efforts that the 
Zionist regime has resorted to hoping to prevent the Palestinian 
Muslims from spreading the intifadah. The suppression of 
Palestinian demonstrators who were protesting the massacre of 
the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque, which has resulted in 
several deaths and injuries, are among the terrorist acts that 
the Zionist regime hoped would end the reactions to the recent 
tragedy. 
  Political analysts believe that the Zionist regime's 
policies 
of persuasion and suppression have not yielded the results that 
Tel Aviv wished but have further clarified the nature of this 
regime. This regime, which has claimed that it does not have 
even one political prisoner and that all prisoners are under 
criminal charges, has displayed contradictory behavior with the 
release of 1,300 Palestinian prisoners in the past few days. 
This step by the Zionist regime, with which it is trying to 
limit the wave of rage from the Palestinian Muslims, has 
revealed that the Zionist regime's allegations on Palestinian 
prisoners are not true, since according to the Zionist regime's 
penal code criminals cannot be released without approval from 
the cabinet. 
  Also, the Zionist regime's efforts to suppress the 
Palestinian demonstrators, which has resulted in hundreds of 
deaths and injuries, has only resulted in its disgrace. By 
massacring the Palestinian Muslims in the streets and alleys of 
the occupied territories, this regime, which stated that the 
tragedy at the shrine was perpetrated by an insane person, has 
revealed an aggressive nature that is not very different from 
that of the allegedly insane criminal.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] In the Name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
One of the wonders of arrogant powers in justifying their 
worldwide plundering interests is the use of political concepts 
with various, and occasionally contradictory, meanings which 
create a convoluted and complex situation and paves the way for 
them to capitalize and misuse. 
  For example, when the expression war and peace loses its 
meaning in Somalia and western forces' invasion of Somalia is 
said to be to restore peace, within that context, war and peace 
would be difficult to appraise in any part of the world. 
  An expression which, more than war and peace, has lost its 
true meaning and is used in various, and sometimes 
contradictory, forms is the concept of human rights. 
  The best evidence of that fact is the present situation in 
occupied Palestine. Murder, assassination, breaking of limbs, 
arrest and torture of Palestinian combatants, and dozens of 
other inhuman acts are the daily achievements of Zionism, of 
which few are unaware. But, despite those terroristic 
activities, which take place officially and semi-officially, the 
violation of human rights in the region is not on the agenda of 
any organization defending human rights. 
  The deadly silence of international forums proclaiming to be 
defenders of human rights places a heavy onus on freedom-seeking 
people of the world, to perform their humanitarian duty and 
bring the oppressed cries of the Muslim people of Palestine to 
the world's ears. 
  Ruyvaran, Middle East analyst of the New Research Group, 
describes the situation in occupied Palestine and the 
international forums overlooking Zionist crimes. 
  He says: 
  Perhaps one could sum up that the Muslim people of Palestine 
are deprived of their right to live, let alone their other 
rights. Basically, the policies of the Zionist regime in the 
occupied territories are not even comparable to the racist 
policies of the apartheid system in South Africa. 
  In the occupied territories, in accordance with the planned 
policies of the Zionist regime, the people of Palestine are 
deprived of a large portion of their political, economic and 
social rights, and basically face unequal conditions in matters 
of education, hygiene and employment. 
  Not even once have the international organizations and 
forums 
objected to the policy of rendering the Muslim people of 
Palestine homeless and settling migrant Zionists in homes which 
used to belong to Palestinians. This is despite the fact that 
such a policy contravenes the fourth article of the Geneva 
Convention. Generally speaking, this policy entails the 
disruption of the demographic composition of Palestine, and this 
is an objective which as a whole constitutes one of the 
indisputable foundations of the Zionist process of thought. 
  Placing Palestinians in protected zones and preventing their 
movement in the occupied Palestine unless with the permission of 
the military governors, has in practice deprived the people of 
Palestine from enjoying equal opportunities in jobs, education, 
and health. This behavior can only be analyzed within the 
framework of the systematic and wholistic policies of the 
Zionists, the main objective of which is the political, 
economic, and scientific impoverishment of Palestinians. 
  Equally important, by training and arming the Zionist 
settlers on the one hand, and then on the other hand depriving 
the Palestinians from the right to defend themselves in that any 
of them who dares carry even knives and other non-firearms is 
punished, the Zionist regime has formed a kind of relationship 
between the Palestinians and the Zionist settlers which 
basically entails that any dispute is invariable resolved by 
coercion and the law of the jungle. 
  The tragedy of the massacre of fasting worshippers in the 
tomb of Abraham, even if one accepts the Zionist regime's claim 
that the crime was committed by an individual, was a natural 
outcome of the aforementioned official policies. So long as 
these policies remain in force, similar tragedies will 
unfortunately happen again. 
  Of course one must not overlook America's role amid all 
this. 
Although Washington was probably more informed than any other 
party about current developments in the occupied territories, 
but it made certain arrangements two years ago to put pressure 
on the UN General Assembly to rescind its resolution which 
equated Zionism with racism. 
  The International Human Rights Committee's turning a blind 
eye to that reality has thus far been an encouragement to the 
Zionist regime to pursue its policies through further violation 
of the rights of the Muslim Palestinian people. Maybe that is 
just the the reason why those international forums cannot be 
considered blameless in the atrocities that are daily happening 
in occupied Palestine. Mr. Mohammadi, from our country's foreign 
ministry, has this to say about the issue: 
  [Begin Mohammadi recording] Human rights and the Palestine 
issue is one of the United Nation's complicated issues. That 
is, on the one hand the Special Committee of 24 for 
Decolonization -- which is one of the main UN General Assembly' 
committees -- condemns Israel every year as a violator of human 
rights and on the other hand the UN Human Rights Commission 
fails to take any measures to prevent human right violations in 
the occupied territories. That can be interpreted in this way 
that the legal aspect of human rights differs from its political 
aspect when applied to various states. That is, wherever the 
political will of those powers which are at the top of the 
United Nations and international organizations is in line with a 
state and those powers are in agreement with such a state then 
the powers take no decisive and urgent action to prevent human 
right violation and are not even willing to issue any binding 
resolution. There human rights is merely confined to its legal 
aspect and is never used as a political weapon to discredit and 
isolate such states. 
  In the last half century the world public opinion has 
witnessed the violation of human rights -- in its worst possible 
form -- in the occupied territories. On the other hand it does 
not seem that anyone can remember that up till now any special 
envoy to have taken any action on human right violations in the 
occupied territories on behalf of the United Nations or the 
Human Rights Commission. Only on one occasion, when 400 
Palestinians were expelled from their homeland, the UN Security 
Council adopted an advisory resolution saying the Palestinian 
should be returned to their homeland. And even that was 
implemented conditionally -- given the occupiers method of 
approach to the resolution. That is, the occupiers decided how 
they were to return to their homeland. 
  Therefore we can draw this conclusion that those states 
which 
are supporters of the Qods occupying regime and are at the top 
of international organizations do not in anyway make use of the 
political aspect of human rights against the image and 
credibility of the Qods occupier regime and fail to adopt 
serious decisions and measures for human rights to be observed 
in the occupied territories. [end recording] 
  The political and discriminatory approach by world powers 
towards human rights issue and their use of it as a pressure 
lever to secure their own plundering interests distances the 
Human Rights Committee and Amnesty International Organization 
from their titles every day and renders them devoid of 
humanitarian objectives.

<F P=106> [Report by staff correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Tehran -- Major General Mohsen Reza'i scoffed at 
Western media reports that claim Iran is for nuclear weapons 
saying "Political logic, morality, our own culture and above all 
the situation in today's world does not allow us to have such 
deadly weapons. [quotation marks as received] 
  The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps head said, "Political 
wisdom asks us not to go for weapons which could cause 
devastation for humanity." 
  "Of course, we are for traditional weapons and that too just 
for self-defense...and that's all," he said. 
  The eight-year Iraqi imposed war is proof of the real nature 
of our combatants who never violated the internationally 
recognized norms concerning war Major Gen. Reza'i recalled. 
  He was referring to the Iraqi forces who left no stone 
unturned violating the basic tradition of war using chemical 
bombs against both civilians and military personnel. The Iraqi 
forces also frequently bombed purely civilians areas during 
their 1980-88 imposed war. 
  "That Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons...is just 
baseless rumor," Reza'i refuted. 
  Western media repeatedly say Iran will or has already 
provided the necessary facilities to Communist North Korea for 
testing missiles with ranges up to 1,000 kilometers. What is 
Reza'i's explanation? 
  "No, a firm no," Major Gen. Reza'i told the TEHRAN TIMES in 
an exclusive interview at his office. 
  "By now the entire world should know that Iran is very 
sensitive as far as our soil and military facilities are 
concerned and we will never allow others to use it...no matter 
how friendly `others' are," he said referring to the friendly 
ties with North Korea. 
  "As long as I'm talking about the real nature of the Islamic 
combatants and the officials of the Islamic Republic, it will 
not be out of place to mention the Russian requests which Iran 
turned down without a second thought,: Reza'i, 41, said. 
  "Despite our animosity and enmity against the United States 
we rejected repeated requests from Moscow to deliver to them the 
F-14 fighter plane and the wire-guided anti-tank missile, TOW," 
he said. 
  He disclosed that even the U.S. through various channels 
tried to obtain a Soviet-made T-72 tank which we seized from the 
Ba'thist forces during the Iraqi-imposed war. 
  The United States once more received `a firm no' from the 
Islamic Republic despite a number of tempting offers from the 
Pentagon, he said. 
  Maj. Gen. Reza'i, head the IRGC for the last 13 years, comes 
from Masjed Soleyman, Khuzestan Province. 
  In answer to another question, Reza'i said the Kuridish 
problem in Iraq is under our observation and our forces are 
ready to counter any sort of terrorist activities launched from 
there. 
  Referring to the agreement signed by Iran and Turkey he said 
"It has eased the situation." 
  He denounced Iraq for sending terrorists and taking undue 
advantage from the present situation in the region underlining 
the fact that that itself was a violation of the 1988 ceasefire 
and against the traditional practice of friendly neighbors. 
  Reza'i is married with five children and currently studying 
economics at the post-graduate level. He has a glorious record 
of revolutionary activities against the now defunct Shah's 
regime. 
  Commenting on the Persian Gulf he said, "The geographical 
situation of the waterway is such that the deep water is on 
Iran's side which enables the Islamic forces to keep alien 
warships under observation." 
  Without going into details he said there was a plot 
engineered by Britain, Israel and the United States designed to 
keep regional tensions high. 
  "I think," he said, "the plot proved to be a mouse trap for 
the United States. 
  "It's my view that no country should think that they can 
take 
undue advantage from the differences between Iran and another 
Persian Gulf country," he warned. 
  He pointed out that the Iraqi regime made the same mistake 
in 
1980 and "we all know the consequences of that." 
  "I tell my friends in the UAE to listen to my advice as Iran 
wants to continue friendly relations with all the shaykhdoms 
there," Reza'i said. 
  The IRGC played a vital role during the Iraqi-imposed war 
and 
received compliments from the Leader of the world's deprived, 
the late Imam Khomeyni. 
  Commenting on the post-war era Reza'i said the IRGC is busy 
with extensive construction projects in the country. He said 
IRGC personnel, popularly known in Iran as `Sepahis,' are 
constructing a major dam, Karkheh, in Khuzestan Province. For 
the last two years, the Sepahis have been building the dam which 
is 3 kilometers long, 150 meters high with a capacity of 7 
billion cubic meters of water. 
  So far Rls. 600 billion have been spent on the project and 
it 
is estimated that Rls. 1 trillion will be spent before it is 
completed. 
  The IRGC personnel are also working on the 100-kilometer 
Tehran-Saveh highway to provide a natural gas supply network for 
the nation.

  [Text] The United Nations is an international organization 
formed to vindicate the rights of nations living under despotism 
and suppression. Now, over 50 years after it was established, 
this international organization's activities are contrary to the 
objectives that have been stated in the UN Charter. Our 
political correspondent interviewed our country's permanent 
representative at the United Nations, who is in Tehran now to 
discuss the United Nations' actions on world events during 
recent years. 
  [Kamal] Kharrazi, our country's permanent UN representative, 
said it is disturbing that the United Nations follows U.S. 
policies and stressed that the United Nations has become more 
like a pressure lever. Citing an example of how the United 
Nations follows U.S. policies, he referred to its stances on 
Iraq, Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina and said: Since U.S. 
interests were involved in the Iraqi and Somali problems, the UN 
presence was strong. But, when it comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the passage of two years since the problem started, it has 
taken no serious step against the Serbs. 
  Elsewhere in his interview, our country's permanent UN 
representative discussed how the United Nations uses human 
rights in its approach to various countries and said: 
  [Begin recording] [Kharrazi] Human rights has been turned 
into a political instrument and everyone, that is, the 
representatives of the various countries at the United Nations, 
knows the human rights issue is a political instrument, not a 
real problem, and that the stance on this issue is very 
selective. One country is selected for political reasons so 
that pressure is exerted on it and the United Nations examines 
human rights in it, while the member countries know that, say, 
the Iranian human rights situation cannot be compared with that 
in many countries nearby. They know this. But in their 
political transactions and under the pressure and influence of 
these countries, they do not vote in our favor. And this is 
because the approach to human rights in general is a political 
one. 
  Basically speaking, we should note one point: The United 
Nations is not a house of justice where everything is based on 
justice. The United Nations, as I said, is a political club in 
which the political interests of countries play a determining 
role. In countries' political transactions among themselves 
they may vote for something. They may not necessarily believe 
in the vote they cast, but they justify their vote on the basis 
of their own political interests. [end recording] 
  In this interview, Kharrazi also referred to the UN Security 
Council's procrastination over dealing with the recent crime by 
the Zionists at al-Khalil and pointed out: Such approaches have 
led the Third World members of the United Nations to demand that 
the Security Council hold open sessions and to the countries of 
the south forming a committee to examine the Security Council's 
actions.

  [Text] Pakistan has welcomed the signing of agreements 
between Bosnia and Croatia for a bicommunal federation in Bosnia 
to be linked with Croatia in a confederation. A statement 
issued by the Foreign Office in Islamabad today said the 
government appreciates the role played by the United States in 
achieving this result and is confident that this accord, which 
follows closely the cease-fire concluded by the Bosnian 
Government and Croats last week, would bring about a lasting 
reconciliation between the two communities. The statement said 
the agreement reached in Washington between the Bosnian 
Government and the Croat community would mark a significant step 
toward a comprehensive peaceful settlement of the Bosnian 
conflict. Pakistan also welcomes the positive role played by 
the Russian Government in the reopening of the Tuzla airport, 
making possible humanitarian aid to the city.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 February 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Regime Said To Collapse 
  2. Government at Odds With Correspondents 
  3. Corruption, Anti-Islamic Policy Viewed 
  4. Normalization With Israel Slammed 
  5. Satellite Dish Invasion 
  6. Preachers Banned From Television 
  7. West's Anti-Islamic Views Refuted 
<H5>  REGIME SAID TO COLLAPSE </H5>
  In its 22 February edition, Cairo AL-SHA'B, the mouthpiece 
of 
the opposition Labor Party, publishes an unattributed 400-word 
report on page 1 citing Britain's THE SUNDAY TIMES' 20 February 
issue saying that the regime in Egypt is threatened with 
collapse at the hands of Islamists. The report says that "a 
confidential U.S. intelligence report being drafted in light of 
reports by the central, foreign, and military intelligence 
services warns against the dangers facing the regime in Egypt 
and its possible collapse in the face of onslaughts by the 
Islamic groups and the consequences this could have for the 
entire Middle East." THE SUNDAY TIMES' report notes: The 
"Islamic fundamentalists will continue to make gains throughout 
the country, which will practically lead to the collapse of the 
Egyptian Government, which is a geopolitical mainstay for U.S. 
policy in the Arab world." The report refers to "the Americans' 
frustration at the security campaigns, torture of suspects, 
military trials, executions, and the government's refusal to 
deal with any of the social problems that give the 
fundamentalists a political advantage." The report claims that 
while the U.S. State Department and U.S. intelligence are urging 
the Egyptian regime to introduce political and economic reforms, 
the regime has refused to change its "hardline attitude." 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT AT ODDS WITH CORRESPONDENTS </H5>
  An approximately 400-word unattributed report on pages 1 and 
7 notes that "dissatisfaction" prevails among foreign 
correspondents in Egypt over the "increasing harassment" to 
which they have recently been subjected by the Egyptian 
authorities for reporting on the situation in Egypt. The 
government is not happy about it. The report notes that the AFP 
bureau chief in Cairo was summoned to the Interior Ministry and 
was "kept waiting" for hours before being "strongly reprimanded" 
by Major General Ra'uf al-Manawi, public relations director at 
the Interior Ministry, for filing a report on an explosion in 
Tanta. 
<H5>  CORRUPTION, ANTI-ISLAMIC POLICY VIEWED </H5>
  Two reports on page 4 feature antigovernment remarks by 
Labor 
Party leaders. One, an approximately 2,000-word report by Salah 
al-Nahif, reviews a speech by party leader Ibrahim Shukri at a 
rally in al-Gharbiyah Governorate. Shukri spoke about various 
political issues, noting the party's campaign against 
"corruption," and in defense of the people's aspirations for 
freedom and political and economic reforms. Shukri said: 
"Under Islam, it is the people's right, rather, their duty, to 
advise and correct the ruler." He added: "I told King Faruq: 
`All those around you are gangsters and thieves.' Today, I 
tell Mubarak: `Many of those around you have become corrupt 
gangs that threaten the very existence of the nation. You must 
rid the country of them.'" Noting that the country is passing 
through a crisis, Shukri added: "It is a tough and extremely 
violent crisis that Egypt is enduring. We still insist that 
political reform is the key to any reform. Political reforms 
begin by amending the law on practicing political rights to 
provide guarantees for fair elections that reflect the will of 
the people." 
  The Labor Party secretary in al-Gharbiyah, Salah al-Qafas, 
also addressed the rally. He reviewed the challenges facing the 
nation and added: "We know that the colonialist forces are not 
looking for friends, but agents. Whoever says he is a friend of 
the United States or others is an agent. There is no such thing 
as a new world order, but rather a domination of the world by 
the United States, which lives by violating the freedoms of 
peoples and plundering their wealth, using Israel as its stick." 
  Labor Party Executive Committee member Muhammad Badr 
referred 
to a "criminal plot to strike at Islam." He said that events in 
Egypt are an attempt to undermine Islam and "weed out the 
Islamic awakening." He added: "Anybody who follows the 
Egyptian media will notice that they act as a spearhead against 
an Islamic inclination by removing moral and religious 
censorship of programs." 
  On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 
1,500-word unattributed report on two speeches given by Labor 
Party Secretary General 'Adil Husayn at a village in 
al-Daqahliyah Governorate. Husayn reviewed the "Western and 
Zionist plots to control our region through the so-called Middle 
East market" and called for the "need for the country to be 
governed by heavenly law." He added: "This nation will 
continue to memorize God's book. It will uphold it as a 
shari'ah to be implemented to provide progress and establish 
justice among the people." He noted that Prophet Muhammad and 
his companions "struggled, persevered, and fought when fighting 
was necessary" to accomplish their mission, because God "does 
not give victory to a people who give up easily or who believe 
that God will give them victory without a struggle against 
themselves, the devil, and the enemies of religion." 
Concluding, Husayn is quoted as pointing out that the Labor 
Party program seeks to "set up a homeland for Islam that could 
ensure dignity and prosperity, provide jobs for the jobless, and 
food and medicine for the needy." The paper cites him adding 
that his party seeks to "restore shari'ah as the law of the 
land" and have "rulers who are opposed to Zionism and the 
enemies of religion; rulers who seek reforms, not cover up the 
corrupt." 

<H5>    NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL SLAMMED </H5>
  Labor Party deputy leader Muhammad Hilmi Murad writes an 
approximately 2,000-word article on page 5 demanding a "popular 
trial" of Deputy Prime Minister Yusuf Wali for his remarks in 
the People's Assembly in which he "glorified Israel, praised its 
scientific and technological advances in agriculture, and 
defended it for its role in cooperating with Egypt in this 
regard." He says Israel's technological and research advantage 
in this regard is nothing but the "fruit of the efforts of the 
scientific centers in the United States and Europe that 
cooperate with Israel." He states that Wali's outspoken remarks 
on normalization with Israel represent a "new era in his role in 
establishing the Middle East market" after years of "diffident" 
calls for courting Israel. Concluding, Murad declares: 
"National duty dictates that we follow what organized and 
conscientious people in some advanced states do and hold a 
popular trial of officials by a selected panel made up of 
specialists and former members of the judiciary." 
  Muslim Brotherhood writer Ahmad al-Malat echoes Murad's 
sentiments in an approximately 1,500-word article on the same 
page. He lashes out at AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Ibrahim Nafi' for 
his calls for better relations with Israel. Admonishing Nafi' 
for saying that there is no permanent enemy or friend, al-Malt 
suggests: "You have forgotten or ignored that the Jews' enmity 
toward Islam is the strongest." Commenting on remarks by Nafi' 
that several Arab businessmen are flocking to Israel to conclude 
business deals with it despite the boycott, al-Malat writes: 
"What is this shame? Isn't it enough that you have surrendered 
the future of your countries to Uncle Sam through the agreements 
you have concluded with him according to which you trust him 
with your necks and in return he guarantees you safety from any 
aggressor?" He adds: "Manhood, chivalry, and jihad have become 
meaningless words in your dictionary. To you they mean nothing 
but extremism and terrorism." 
  Al-Malat states that Nafi' was "shameless" enough to call 
for 
giving priority to joint ventures with Israel. He asks: "Who 
gave you the right, honorable writer, to chart Egypt's policy as 
you please and do so contrary to the desire of its noble Muslim 
people, who refuse to sell their gas to their enemies and who 
continue to break the bones of our children and slaughter our 
youth in the holy land?" He adds: "O enthusiastic writer, I 
tell you and the rulers who follow you that this is not your 
cause, but the cause of Islam." He adds: "If you are short of 
nerve in defending the usurped right, declare it for history's 
sake and admit publicly that you are not up to jihad, yet don't 
close the door on the abluted hands that seek, through 
legitimate jihad, to regain as much as possible of the land and 
dignity that you have wasted. Call these mujahidin by the real 
names that God almighty has given them. Don't say that they are 
advocates of violence and terrorism, for violence and terrorism 
are the qualities of those who have usurped the land from its 
real owners." He adds: "Do not sing the praises of the glory 
expected from this satanic openness, which you covertly worked 
to achieve not too long ago and on which you are working 
publicly and insolently today. You imagine that after muffling 
the sincere mouths, breaking the honest pens, and keeping only 
the hypocrites, you have every right to speak in the name of the 
vanquished peoples who cannot afford to tell the truth in their 
own country." 
<H5>  SATELLITE DISH INVASION </H5>
  Muhammad Abu-al-Futuh, in an approximately 1,000-word 
article 
on page 9, comments on an article by writer Sa'd-al-Din Wahbah 
in AL-AHRAM on 22 January rejecting calls for prohibiting 
satellite dishes. Abu-al-Futuh argues that dishes bring more 
"poison, immorality, and decadence" than benefits, which makes 
them a "ferocious threat that must be resisted." He points out 
that the Egyptian people's traditions have withstood numerous 
military invasions and occupations, but that the "cultural 
invasion and occupation is a malignant enemy" that brainwashes 
people and is, therefore, more serious. He adds: "The obscene 
and homosexual programs that the dish will bring us are more 
dangerous than cancer and AIDS. It is the intellectual and 
cultural AIDS." 
<H5>  PREACHERS BANNED FROM TELEVISION </H5>
  Muslim Brotherhood writer Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus, in an 
approximately 600-word article on page 12, criticizes Egyptian 
television for its superficial programming and for banning some 
Islamic preachers from appearing on television. 
<H5>  WEST'S ANTI-ISLAMIC VIEWS REFUTED </H5>
  In a 400-word column on page 12, Islamic Preacher Muhammad 
al-Ghazali slams the West's accusations against Islam.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 22 February 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Awqaf Minister's Efforts Defended 
  2. Imams Urged to Take Propagation Initiative 
  3. Western Media Criticized 
  4. Koran Meanings Translated into Albanian, Bosnian 
  5. NATO Ultimatum to Serbs 
<H5>  AWQAF MINISTER'S EFFORTS DEFENDED </H5>
  In its 22 February issue, the state-owned weekly 'AQIDATI 
publishes on page one a 300-word editorial signed by Board 
Chairman Samir Rajab defending Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali 
Mahjub from criticism. The writer begins by saying that it is 
not surprising to see Dr. Mahjub attacked because he is a 
successful man, and it has become the habit in Egypt to 
criticize only successful people. He adds that the main 
accusation leveled at the minister was that only policemen and 
state employees attend his seminars and meetings, but this 
accusation was refuted last week when thousands came to hear him 
speak in Upper Egypt. The writer then praises the minister for 
his successful efforts in bringing Christians and Muslims closer 
together and arranging meetings between Coptic Pope Shinudah and 
Dr. 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi and Shaykh Muhammad Mutawalli 
al-Sha'rawi. In conclusion, the writer says: "While Awqaf 
Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has taken upon himself the 
task of confronting terrorism with an enlightened mind and a 
boldness that many lack, he must fully realize that the 
propagators, planners, and perpetrators of terrorism will use 
all illegal means to deter him from this noble aim. Hence, what 
they are using against him now is one of these dirty tricks, 
intellectual terrorism. But we tell him: Continue on this path 
and fear nothing but God Almighty, your conscience, and the 
Egyptian people." 
<H5>  IMAMS URGED TO TAKE PROPAGATION INITIATIVE </H5>
  Further reporting on Dr. Mahjub's activities, the paper 
publishes on page two a 450-word report on speeches he made in 
al-Minya and Asyut that focused on the roles and duties of 
mosque imams. Speaking in al-Minya, he urged the imams to retake 
the initiative in propagation and stand firmly against 
impostors. He said: "Religious propagation and those in charge 
of it have entered a stage where the situation has become 
confused and trends have diversified; where a group that has no 
knowledge of religion, its tenets, or the rules or methods of 
propagation are vying with the legally, religiously, and 
constitutionally qualified imams. This has lead to confusion in 
religious thinking among our youth. Adulterated thinking has 
been propagated among our youths by a group of people who have 
nothing to do with their religion's thinking and who are not 
asked to explain this thinking." He then warned: "We will pay 
a heavy price and the moderate Islamic course will be affected" 
if any of the imams fail in their duties. After stating a 
similar message in a speech in Asyut, the minister added that 
the state is responsible for the correct concept of Islamic 
propagation, fully supports religious establishments, and gives 
them unlimited backing. He then urged the imams to go to the 
streets, mosques, youth centers, and schools to spread the 
message. 
<H5>  WESTERN MEDIA CRITICIZED </H5>
  On page six, the paper publishes a 340-word comment by 
Basyuni al-Halawani in the "Very Frankly" column, in which he 
criticizes the Western media for exaggerating "individual and 
limited" terrorist actions that take place in Egypt in order to 
distort the image of Islam and damage Egypt's economy. After 
noting the number of terrorist incidents in Germany in 1993, the 
writer says that comparing the terrorist incidents in Egypt with 
those abroad shows that real terrorism is in Europe and not in 
Egypt, "which remains the most stable and safe country in the 
world, and that treachery and betrayal will not change the 
Egyptians' tolerant nature." But, he adds, the western media is 
persisting in exaggerating these incidents, and this shows that 
there are specific objectives in this campaign. He then calls 
for a stand against these correspondents "who speak only in the 
name of extremism and terrorism and who are looking daily for 
whatever distorts our image and damages our interests while 
turning a blind eye to all Egyptian achievements." He adds that 
this entails drawing up rules and regulations and reviewing our 
media policy of dealing with terrorism and extremism so as not 
to give the Western media the opportunity to continue publishing 
tendentious reports. 
<H5>  KORAN MEANINGS TRANSLATED INTO ALBANIAN, BOSNIAN </H5>
  The paper carries on page 11 a 700-word report describing 
the 
efforts of the Islamic Relief Society and its latest 
achievement, the printing of 100,000 copies of interpretations 
of the Koran in the Albanian and Bosnian languages for 
distribution among Muslims in these two countries. 
<H5>  NATO ULTIMATUM TO SERBS </H5>
  On page 21, 'AQIDATI carries a 300-word comment by Ashraf 
Abu-al-Hawl on the aftermath of the NATO ultimatum to the Serbs 
in Bosnia. He says that NATO should extend this ultimatum to 
other Muslim areas but concludes by saying that one should not 
expect "the West to sacrifice its sons for a few Muslims, even 
if they are Europeans or Slavs, as is the case with the 
Bosnians. Therefore, we have no choice but to accept the West's 
solution as long as we cannot resolve it ourselves."

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 25 February 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Human Rights Violations Claimed 
  2. Government-Serbian Ties Cited 
  3. Mufti Interviewed on Israelis 
  4. Copts Urged To Denounce Butrus-Ghali 
  5. Butrus-Ghali Trial Urged 
  6. Release of Hamas Leader Urged 
  7. Yusuf Wali Castigated 
<H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS CLAIMED </H5>
  A 400-word report on pages 1 and 7 cites a statement by the 
Egyptian Organization for Human Rights claiming irregularities 
in police handling of confrontations with and arrests of 
extremists. 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT-SERBIAN TIES ALLEGED </H5>
  A 350-word report by 'Abd-al-Sattar Abu-Husayn appears on 
pages 1 and 7. Abu-Husayn starts out by saying: "Our 
government has committed a new crime against the memory of 
Bosnian martyrs, thus refuting all its claims of seeking to stop 
the Serbian massacres of Bosnian Muslims. Our government 
continues to deal with European companies exporting weapons to 
Serbs. It even allowed the Serbian military attache in Cairo to 
engage in supplying his countries with its military needs in 
weapons and hardware through a gun-running network of companies 
in Egypt, Cyprus, and other countries in the region." 
'Abd-al-Sattar then summarizes a DER SPIEGEL report to the 
effect that "Serbian authorities have made Cairo their center 
for contacts in the region and for providing supplies to the 
Serbian war machine with the help of the Serbian military 
attache in Cairo." 
<H5>  MUFTI INTERVIEWED ON ISRAELIS </H5>
  A 2,700-word report by Muhammad Hilal on page 6 includes 
Hilal's telephone interviews with Mufti of the Republic Muhammad 
Sayyid Tantawi and Ahmad Jamal Abu-al-'Aza'im, a leading 
Egyptian psychologist. The topic of the interviews is a 
conference held recently in Dar al-Ifta' or the house of Islamic 
legal opinions, of which the mufti is the head. The conference, 
organized by Abu-al- 'Aza'im, was attended by Israelis. Hilal 
is opposed to their presence in this "impregnable Islamic 
bastion" and questions both the mufti and the psychologist about 
this event. He writes: 
  "I said: The Israelis [were] in Dar al-Ifta'. Why, Your 
Eminence? 
  "His eminence the mufti is quoted: `By God, my son. I do 
not know of their participation in the conference, and I did not 
notice them in the hall when I delivered the opening speech on 
"Islam's Way of Resolving Conflicts."'" 
  The mufti then explains that he granted Abu-al-'Aza'im's 
request to use the Dar al-Ifta's conference room without 
inquiring about the identity of the delegates. Asked what he 
will do if Abu-al-'Aza'im requests using the conference room for 
another conference, the mufti is cited saying: "After what 
happened, I will ask him about the identity of the delegations 
he will invite." Hilal presses the mufti further: 
  "I said: `If, among the delegations, there is an Israeli 
delegation, will you refuse to hold the conference in 
Dar-al-Ifta?' 
  "His eminence the mufti said: `Listen, my son, do not ask me 
who entered Dar al-Ifta' and what his identity or religion was. 
But ask me what Dar al-Ifta' will tell them.'" 
  Jalal then asks the mufti about his speech to the conference 
and the mufti says: "I only delivered the opening speech and 
welcomed the guests. If you want to learn more, get in touch 
with Dr. Abu-al-'Aza'im." 
  Jalal does that, phoning Abu-al-'Aza'im, who reacts to his 
questions with a call for dialogue as a means of ending 
hostilities in the region. The psychologist says: "Frankly 
speaking, enmity between us and Israel is a mere psychological 
wall that we are trying to demolish so that everyone may live in 
peace." 

<H5>    COPTS URGED TO DENOUNCE BUTRUS-GHALI </H5>
  A 600-word column by Dr. Muhammad Muru appears on page 6 
under the headline "Conspiracy against Egyptian Copts." Muru 
writes: "Sectarianism is an old imperial game that never goes 
out of fashion. Egypt, which remains a major obstacle to the 
imperialist and Zionist scheme, is facing a multiple threat. 
Turning Copts against Muslims in Egypt is an old policy that 
was pursued by British imperialism and by American and Zionist 
imperialism more recently. As part of this scheme, Muslim 
sensitivities are provoked so that they turn against Copts, 
making them hostile to the national cultural endeavor and swear 
allegiance to the Western imperial scheme." 
  Muru reviews the history of Prime Minister Butrus-Ghali, a 
Coptic politician, who, hated by the nationalist movement, was 
assassinated in 1910 by a fellow Copt. The slain prime minister 
is the grandfather of the current UN secretary general, with 
whose policies Muru disagrees: "Today, Butrus-Ghali, the 
grandson, acts in a similar manner that provokes every Egyptian. 
The Coptic Egyptian UN secretary general does not hide his 
sympathies with Israel, describes UN Security Council Resolution 
242 as not binding, and acquits himself as a hardliner in 
affairs concerning the blockade of Iraqi children and the Libyan 
people." 
  The UN secretary general, Muru adds, "plays a suspicious and 
insolent part in the continuing massacres against the Bosnian 
people." 
  Muru then reasons that the Copts should denounce the 
"crimes" 
of the UN secretary general, as their grandfathers denounced his 
grandfather's, "so as to foil the imperialist scheme aiming to 
foment hostility between the country's two religious 
communities." 
<H5>  BUTRUS-GHALI TRIAL URGED </H5>
  A 1,100-word report by Khalid Yunus on page 7 concerns a 
seminar held by the Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia on 
Monday 21 February. He writes: "The seminar held by the 
Egyptian Committee for Supporting Bosnia last Monday on the 
subject of `UN Legal and International Responsibility Toward the 
Bosnian Issue' called for staging a popular trial of the United 
Nations and its Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali and for the 
formation of a preparatory committee to make arrangements for 
the trial within two months." 
  The seminar, Yunus adds, was attended by "a large number of 
international law experts and political figures, led by Labor 
Party leader Ibrahim Shukri." 
  Addressing the seminar, Labor Party leader Shukri is cited 
as 
saying that "the trial of the United Nations and its Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali is an urgent necessity in view of UN 
positions and resolutions that only serve Serbian schemes." 
<H5>  RELEASE OF HAMAS LEADER URGED </H5>
  An unattributed 350-word column entitled "Palestinian 
Issues: 
Vatican and Shaykh Yasin" appears on page 8. The unidentified 
columnist notes that the Vatican is marking the holocaust. 
  The writer asks: "What is curious is that this is the first 
time the Vatican is marking this occasion, which is taking place 
at a time when the truth about this presumed pogrom is starting 
to come out. Studies appearing even in the West speak of a big 
lie behind this story that has been touted for decades and been 
used by champions of Zionism to flagellate the world into a 
feeling of guilt so that they may earn undeserved compensation 
for an alleged tragedy." 
  The columnist wonders why the Vatican should feel sympathy 
with a tragedy that "even if it is true" happened decades ago 
but overlooks the "living tragedy" of the Palestinian people. 
The columnist then asserts that the health of Ahmad Yasin, 
58-year-old spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement--Hamas, "is seriously deteriorating as he languishes in 
an Israeli jail." The writer concludes: "Where are those who 
negotiate and mediate with Israel? Why don't they call for the 
release of the paralyzed shaykh?" 
<H5>  YUSUF WALI CASTIGATED </H5>
  AL-SHA'B continues its long-running campaign against Yusuf 
Wali, deputy prime minister and minister of agriculture, 
livestock and fisheries, and land reclamation. A 2,200-word 
report by Salah Budaywi headlined "Wali and the Zionists Prepare 
a 45-Clause Plan To Promote the Idea of a Middle East Market" 
appears on page 10. 
  Budaywi notes that the "Higer Zionist-Egyptian Agricultural 
Committee held its 18th session in Cairo late in the week before 
last." He then highlights a 25-point protocol on agricultural 
cooperation that was signed by both sides and calls for the 
establishment of joint scientific research centers and training 
programs. 
  Throughout his report, Budaywi attempts to make the point 
that such cooperation with the "Zionist entity" is designed to 
ensure regional supremacy for the latter. For example, he 
writes: "The two sides agreed to request assistance from 
Washington in implementing a joint program in the framework of 
the Middle East market. The program, involving the United 
States, Egypt, the Zionist entity, and the Palestinians, aims at 
reclaiming desert areas in the Middle East and improving 
agriculture production. The program is designed to give the 
Zionist entity and its experts the upper hand."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, </F>
referred to as the "President of the State of Palestine," in 
Tunis, by Muhammad al-Ashwaf, in Cairo, from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Ashwaf] President 'Arafat, we welcome you to the 
Voice of the Arabs. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, what is the Palestinian position 
on the consequences of the terrible massacre perpetrated by the 
Jewish settlers against our Palestinian people in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron last Friday? What new political and security 
revelations has this event provided? 
  ['Arafat] We must first point out that we were expecting 
such 
tragedies and wished to implement the Washington and Cairo 
Agreements quickly. But it is clear that the Israeli leaders 
are determined to continue their ploys of not implementing the 
agreement and evading commitment to the agreed deadlines. I 
wish now to refer to a grave issue, which we have discussed very 
frankly with the Israeli officials. This is connected with the 
involvement of some Israeli army units in the Hebron crime, a 
crime that recalls an earlier massacre in the al-Aqsa Mosque and 
another in Rishon LeZiyyon, that is, the 'Ayn Qarah. These army 
units were also involved in other tragedies and clashes 
following the Hebron massacre. Over 29 martyrs and 280 wounded 
have fallen in addition to the large number of victims who fell 
in Hebron: Some 65 martyrs and 256 wounded. One massacre 
followed another: First, the catastrophic massacre in Hebron 
and another perpetrated by the army in which 29 martyrs fell and 
280 were wounded. What does this mean? This means that, as we 
have noted, some Israeli army units are in collusion with the 
armed settlers. I said this to Rabin when he telephoned me to 
express his condolences. I told him: I have such and such 
information. Under 20 minutes after the massacre, they--my 
brothers Mustafa al-Natshah, 'Aziz 'Amr, 'Ali al-Qawasimah, and 
the doctors at the hospital--telephoned me from al-Ahli Hospital 
in Hebron and told me that an attack was waged against the 
people who had gathered in the hospital to see the victims. 
What does this mean? The Israeli Army is colluding with the 
settlers. Are we confronting the same thing that our Algerian 
brothers faced at the hands of the secret army? Our Algerian 
brothers faced the same thing after they concluded the Evian 
Treaty. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] President 'Arafat, the ugly crime against the 
worshippers in the Ibrahimi Mosque has brought the issue of 
Palestinian security strongly to the fore and showed that undue 
emphasis on Israeli security involves a major falsehood. What 
are your views about providing security for the Palestinians in 
light of the Hebron massacre? 
  ['Arafat] It is clear now how hollow the Israeli ploy was. 
Whenever we made any proposal, they used the settlers' security 
as an excuse. What must now be provided is security for the 
Palestinian people. This is why we insisted on submitting the 
issue to the Security Council. We had a lot of trouble before 
we could convene a meeting of the Security Council. We really 
had a lot of trouble. Our Egyptian brothers, as the current 
chairmen of the Arab group at the United Nations, are working 
directly with us and know how much trouble we had at the 
Security Council before we could convene the current session. 
We are asking the Security Council to do two things: First, to 
disarm the settlers, because there must be no power other than 
the Israeli occupying army, and second, to provide an 
international force to protect the Palestinian people, our 
children, women, men, and masses and our Islamic and Christian 
sanctities. Do you follow me? We are trying at the Security 
Council and we hope to get a resolution adopted. We hope to do 
this despite the difficulty of the discussions and the 
maneuvering. We are waging a fierce battle at the Security 
Council. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, you have demanded international 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. What is the extent of that protection? Or, what 
measures do you consider sufficient to meet the requirements of 
that protection? 
  ['Arafat] We want protection like that established for our 
brothers in Bosnia-Herzegovina, like the international 
protection in Cambodia or that in Somalia. Why should the 
Palestinian people alone be deprived of international protection? 
  [Al-Ashwaf] Speaking about an international force, Israel 
has 
announced its acceptance of a civilian international presence in 
Gaza and Jericho alone. Do you think this is sufficient? 
  ['Arafat] Of course, it is not sufficient. Should we also 
get guards to protect international observers? Where could we 
obtain such protection, for God's sake? Is it a joke? This 
shows their carelessness; it shows that the crime and the 
massacre moved nothing in the Israeli mentality. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] We move to another point: The repercussions of 
the crime have led the Arab-Israeli negotiations, particularly 
on the Palestinian-Israeli track, to a real impasse. What is 
the scale of that impasse? 
  ['Arafat] As we announced, we and the brother Arabs who 
suspended the talks are not against negotiations. We have 
particular terms to be fulfilled before we can resume these 
talks. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] What are these terms? 
  ['Arafat] We should at least see what will happen, whether 
in 
the UN Security Council or in the Israeli Government; we should 
see whether the Israeli Government will take particular measures 
against the settlers and their weapons. I would like to remind 
everyone, near and far, of what Rabin said. Didn't he say there 
were political and security settlements? Some of these 
settlements belong to those extremists. What measures will 
Israel take against the settlements that belong to extremist 
groups like Kakh, Barukh, and God knows who else? What can I 
tell you? There are varying groups. Our people are required to 
offer all these sacrifices on every level. I would like to say 
that these massacres have not enfeebled us. We are the people 
of martyrs, liberals, revolutionaries, and strugglers. We are a 
formidable people. Massacres will not make us kneel down, epics 
will not weaken us, and conspiracies will not lower our morals. 
"So lose not heart nor fall into despair, for ye must gain 
mastery" [Koranic verse]. This must be clear to everyone, near 
and far. Tragedies and massacres will only make us stronger and 
firmer. We are the servants of this holy land; each one of us 
is willing to sacrifice his life. "On that day shall the 
believers rejoice with the help of God. He helps whom he will 
and he is exalted in might, most merciful" [Koranic verse]. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] You earlier noted that Israel promoted weapons 
in 
the occupied territories. What is the truth in this? 
  ['Arafat] I am saying that these [settlers] are units of the 
Israeli army. This means that we are up against the same 
situation our brother Algerians encountered. A secret 
organization within the army is distributing weapons so that 
when they withdraw, an inter-Palestinian massacre will ensue. 
No inter-Palestinian massacre will take place. We differ in 
our views. [Second Muslim Caliph] 'Umar Ibn-al-Khattab said: 
May God have mercy on a man who corrects 'Umar's mistakes. We 
welcome counterviews. But this will neither dissuade us nor 
weaken our determination. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] Mr. President, before we conclude this dialogue, 
would you say a word to the sons of the steadfast Palestinian 
people in the occupied territories? 
  ['Arafat] I tell them that this is an opportunity to enhance 
the unity of our ranks and to stand up in one line against our 
enemy. "Truly God loves those who fight in his cause in battle 
array as if they were a solid cemented structure" [Koranic 
verse]. I say to them: Have patience and rely on God's help. I 
know the road is difficult and long but our determination is 
stronger and we are more patient. "Our Lord, pour out constancy 
on us and make our steps firm and help us against those that 
reject faith." "Blot out our sins and grant us forgiveness and 
have mercy on us. Thou art our protector. Help us against 
those who stand against faith" [Koranic verse]. God willing, we 
will get together soon to pray in the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and 
the Ibrahimi Mosque. We will also pray at the Church of the 
Sepulcher and in Bethlehem as one people with one firm will. 
"That even the apostle and those of faith who were with him 
cried: When will come the help of God? Ah! Verily, the help 
of God is always near," [Koranic verse]. We will stick together 
until victory, victory, victory with the help of God. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] Would you like to emphasize anything else? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to thank my brothers in Egypt and 
President Mubarak for the effort they are making with us. I 
thank the custodian of the two holy mosques, my brothers in the 
Arab Maghreb, all our Arab brothers, and the Islamic and 
Christian powers that have stood firmly with us on the incident. 
I thank them for their support. We will stick together until 
we get to Jerusalem, God willing. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] We thank you deeply and welcome you always on 
the 
Voice of the Arabs. 
  ['Arafat] God willing, we will pray together in Jerusalem. 
  [Al-Ashwaf] God willing.

and submits its report to the PLO Executive Committee as soon as

  [Editorial Report] Nicosia FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 
6 March publishes on page 11 what it claims to be a photocopy of 
a cable sent on 16 October 1993 by the chairman of the Supreme 
Islamic Committee in Jerusalem and the chairman of the Awqaf and 
Islamic Affairs Council to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
complaining about the settlers' practices in the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron. The "cable" reads: 
  "Mr. Prime Minister and Defense Minister, Tel Aviv: 
  "Subject: The Holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
  "On the evening of Friday 8 October 1993, a number of Jewish 
settlers attacked six of the guards of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
and a 64-year-old worshipper during and after the call for 
evening prayers after a certain (Barukh) [parenthesis as 
published] attacked the muezzin. Incendiary chemical material 
was thrown on the mosque's carpets on the evening of Thursday 14 
October 1993. But for the vigilance of the guards and 
worshippers, the worst could have happened. 
  "These repeated daily attacks on the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
cannot remain ignored. 
  "Regrettably, we have never felt that the Israeli 
authorities 
have adopted any measures on the practices of these aggressive 
settlers. 
  "We would like to make it clear that we did not approve in 
the past, do not approve now, and will not approve or condone 
any prayers by non-Muslims in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque. We 
hope the officials will put an end to these provocative and 
aggressive practices against the freedom of worship and against 
the Muslims' absolute right to their mosque." The cable is 
signed: 
  "With due respect,

  [Excerpt] After its recent meetings in Tunis following the 
Hebron massacre, the PLO leadership has sent a letter to Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres that includes a number of 
conditions before resuming peace talks. Among these conditions 
is the protection of Palestinian citizens. This letter was 
conveyed to the Israeli minister last night by the chairman of 
the EU Council of Ministers, who left Tunisia yesterday, and by 
the Russian deputy foreign minister, who carried a private 
message from President Boris Yeltsin for President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  The chairman of the EU Council of Ministers had also met 
President Yasir 'Arafat. After the meeting, the Israeli foreign 
minister said he was ready to discuss any new conditions with 
the PLO provided they did not contradict with the Declaration of 
Principles. Peres added that some conditions included in the 
organization's letter, like the release of prisoners, had been 
met and that other conditions were unclear. 
  Regarding a likely Security Council resolution concerning 
foreign presence in Gaza and Jericho, Peres said that was 
possible in accordance with what had been stipulated in one of 
the Declaration of Principles' clauses, but that presence would 
not be an alternative to the Palestinian police force, 
increasing the number of which will be discussed by the two 
sides. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jibril Rajjub, PLO adviser on territorial </F>
affairs, by Moti Amir in Tunis on the "Morning Newsreel" 
program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Amir] The PLO leader these days enjoys almost total 
support in the PLO Executive Committee and among his advisers. 
All of them support his demand to disarm the settlers, 
reorganize the settlements before the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, and deploy international observers in 
the territories. 
  'Arafat's assistant Jibril Rajjub told us in an interview in 
Tunis that Israel is responsible for torpedoing the Oslo 
agreement. 
  [Rajjub] I believe the PLO cannot resume the peace process 
or 
negotiations without a new basis. The new basis is solving the 
problem of the settlers. I think that uprooting all the 
settlers from Hebron is the only solution to return to the 
negotiations. Those who killed and those who danced and 
celebrated after the brutal massacre in the mosque will have no 
peace and there will be no coexistence with them. We will not 
give them security while they live in Hebron. 
  [Amir] What are you afraid of? What can happen in Hebron 
now? 
  [Rajjub] Anything is possible. One day a mad person might 
come and do the same thing. No one can guarantee that the 
Hebronites will not take revenge. What happened motivates us 
all to take revenge and react in the way they see fit. It is 
better to solve the whole problem and remove the settlers. I 
think we will be traitors if we agree that those who celebrated 
the massacre in Hebron will remain in Hebron. 
  [Amir] Does this mean the negotiations remain deadlocked and 
that you are reopening the Oslo agreement? 
  [Rajjub] Listen, the deadlock happened after the brutal 
massacre in Hebron. Negotiations have taken place over six 
months following the Declaration of Principles agreement. The 
negotiations have always been linked with the security and peace 
of the settlers and settlements. What happened proved that 
security and peace can be achieved when we send the settlers to 
hell. 
  [Amir] Rajjub announced that Fatah will renew the armed 
struggle against Israel. Was this a PLO instruction? 
  [Rajjub] There has been no decision to end the struggle. 
Perhaps the means have changed but as long as there is 
occupation and settlers, no orders are given to end the struggle. 
  [Amir] Will the Fatah Movement initiate a revenge operation 
following the Hebron massacre? 
  [Rajjub] Anything is possible. I think this is a 
possibility. No one can tell you that something like this won't 
happen. 
  [Amir] Regarding the contacts between Tzomet and the Labor 
Party, total indifference is being demonstrated on the surface. 
But Palestinian sources note that including Tzomet in the 
government will, in their opinion, restrict the Israeli 
Government's freedom of action in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians and enable Rabin to act more forcefully against the 
extremists among the settlers.

<F P=106> [Khalil Matar report: "PLO's UN Representative Tells </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: U.S. Position Gradually Getting Closer to 
Ours"] 
  [Text] New York -- Nasir al-Qudwah, Palestinian 
representative at the United Nations, has emphasized that the 
PLO will not back down from its position reflected in the 
Palestinian draft resolution submitted to the Security Council. 
That, he stressed, is the acceptable minimum. He praised the 
attitude of the Arab and Islamic groups and their full support 
for the PLO demands. 
  It should be noted that the United States and the PLO were 
until yesterday evening trying to break the deadlock over the 
drafting of a Security Council resolution condemning the 
massacre. Two draft resolutions have been submitted to the 
Security Council since last Friday. One of them is a 
Palestinian draft resolution, supported by the Arab and Islamic 
states and also by some other states, requesting protection for 
the Palestinians in the occupied territory, in addition to 
condemning the massacre and being binding on Israel. The other 
is a U.S. draft resolution just condemning the massacre without 
any commitment. 
  The council is supposed to have resumed its consultations 
last night. On the Palestinian draft resolution, al-Qudwah told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our position has, from the first moment, 
been that the council should convene officially and pass a 
resolution containing the following elements: 
  1. A clear and strong condemnation of the massacre; 
  2. Confirmation that the fourth Geneva Convention applies to 
all the occupied territory including Jerusalem; 
  3. A call for a UN presence in the occupied territory to 
provide protection for the Palestinian people there; 
  4. A request that Israel and the occupation forces take 
specific measures against the settlers, including disarming them. 
  He added: "At the beginning the Americans insisted that a 
statement by the chairman would be sufficient, but now their 
position is gradually drawing closer to ours. We will not 
change our position because it is not a tactical position. We 
are asking for the minimum." In response to the U.S. position 
that what the draft resolution calls for in connection with the 
protection point is based on the Declaration of Principles on 
Gaza and Jericho and as such is an attempt to expand its scope 
prematurely, al-Qudwah said: "My understanding is that there is 
no qualitative difference between Gaza and Jericho and the rest 
of the occupied territory. There may be a differentiation only 
as far as the time factor is concerned, but that does not mean 
that there should be discrimination on the principle, 
particularly as the Declaration of Princples stipulates that it 
is a first step that would extend to all the occupied 
Palestinian territory." 
  On early participation by the Security Council in measures 
not agreed on with the Israelis, as the Americans say, the 
Palestinian representative declared: "As far as we are 
concerned the Security Council was and remains the body solely 
responsible for anything connected with Israeli violations of 
the fourth Geneva Convention whether there is a peace process or 
not. This is based on the understanding we reached with former 
U.S. Secretary of State James Baker before the Madrid 
conference." 
  He added: "We are not trying to find an alternative 
mechanism to the current peace process, but we stress that the 
council's role on matters which only it has the power to 
legislate or confirm should be preserved." On the reference to 
Jerusalem, he said: "The phraseology regarding it in the draft 
resolution cannot be changed at all because that is the same 
phraseology used in all the UN General Assembly and Security 
Council resolutions since 1967. Any change would mean some kind 
of concession and acceptance of the Israeli position on it. 
Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied territory and 
nobody can deny our right to it." He added: "As regards the 
claim that, having agreed to the postponement of the 
negotiations on the status of Jerusalem and the settlements, the 
Palestinians should drop their advance demands regarding them -- 
that claim is rejected. The legal status of the settlements is 
still the same, and there has been no political change that 
would make it incumbent on us to abandon our position on them. 
They remain illegitimate irrespective of when the negotiations 
on them take place. The same thing applies to Jerusalem, which 
remains an occupied territory regardless of when the 
negotiations on its final status take place."

  [Excerpt] A well informed Palestinian source in Tunis last 
night confirmed that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, the head of the PLO 
Information Department would arrive in Paris today to hold talks 
with French officials regarding the conditions of resuming 
Israeli-Palestinian economic talks, halted since the Hebron 
massacre. This is within the framework of what the PLO 
Executive Committee decided in its recent meetings regarding 
sending envoys to Western countries to explain its [PLO] 
conditions for resuming talks with Israel on the implementation 
of the agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  A French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said yesterday that 
France, who is chairing the [UN] Security Council this month, 
was hoping for the Security Council's approval of a resolution 
very soon. The spokeswoman raised the [issue of the] need for 
the immediate implementation by the Israeli authorities of the 
measures taken against the settlers and those to the benefit of 
the Palestinians. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 4 (AFP) -- PLO information chief Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh said Friday [25 February] that the presence of 
international observers under UN supervision would greatly help 
to restore Palestinian confidence after the Hebron massacre. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh, speaking after a meeting with French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, said an observer presence "would have a 
very strong symbolic meaning to restore confidence among the 
Palestinians of the occupied territories." 
  Juppe confirmed that France was prepared to send observers 
under United Nations authority, adding that Israel's security 
measures needed to be observed by "international representatives 
mandated by the UN." 
  On Thursday [3 March] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
backed the idea of an international force to protect 
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and said Britain was 
ready to take part. 
  Juppe said he hoped a UN Security Council resolution on the 
observers would be passed "as soon as possible." The resolution 
has been held up for almost a week because of differences with 
the United States. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh visited Paris as part of a Palestine Liberation 
Organisation effort in world capitals to explain its conditions 
for resuming autonomy negotiations with Israel. 
  The negotiations were broken off after the massacre, in 
which 
52 Palestinians were slaughtered in a mosque by an Israeli 
gunman. 
  Resuming the peace process and putting the autonomy accord 
into effect would be "unthinkable" at a time when "armed 
settlers are walking freely among the Palestinians," 'Abd-Rabbuh 
said. 
  'Abd-Rabbuh will next visit Brussels for a meeting with 
European Commission President Jacques Delors. Nabil Sha'th, PLO 
chairman Yasir Arafat's advisor, met with Hurd in London on 
Thursday before heading for Washington where he was set to meet 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Friday.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', chief of the PLO </F>
Economic Department, in Tunis, by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio, 
from the "With the Events" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Apparently, there is no alternative to 
resuming the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. What is the 
solution for the resumption of these negotiations? 
  [Quray'] First of all, we believe there is no alternative to 
negotiations in order to implement the Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington. However, the negotiations cannot be 
resumed without providing an appropriate climate and the 
necessary conditions to resume them. Therefore, confidence, 
which has been undermined, must be restored and there should be 
an appropriate climate. The Israeli Government should work 
seriously to provide this climate because matters are in its 
hands, and not in the hands of others at all. The Israeli 
Government should first ensure that settlers will not move about 
carrying weapons outside their homes, if it is unable to 
immediately disarm them. The second point is that there should 
be a serious discussion about dismantling a certain group of 
settlements, since those settlements constitute a real threat to 
the peace process. The third point is that the Palestinian 
people are worried about their security. After the Declaration 
of Principles has been signed and while we are discussing with 
the Israelis the security issues that concern them, it is now 
time to have a serious discussion about the security of the 
Palestinians. The real threat is the one against Palestinian 
security. Therefore, the Palestinians should rest assured that 
there is protection for them. Why not have an international 
presence? Why not? 
  [Mu'addi] Do these conditions represent the minimum demands 
in order to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations? 
  [Quray'] First of all, I did not set conditions. I spoke 
about providing an appropriate climate conducive to the success 
of the negotiations. This massacre has created a psychological 
shock. Therefore, an appropriate climate should be created. 
This is not in our hands. It is in the hands of the Israeli 
Government. The ball now is in the Israeli Government's court. 
If it wants this process to succeed and this agreement to be 
implemented, then it should promptly take these measures. 
Another question, which I believe should be taken into 
consideration if the Israelis are serious, is that a committee 
should be formed now to hold negotiations on the question of 
settlements. I know the discussion of settlement activity was 
postponed until the final status negotiations, but this massacre 
has proven that settlements should be discussed now. I am not 
setting this as a condition related to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, but I am pointing out this issue so that it can be 
discussed as of now. By the time the final negotiations are 
held, this process will have made major steps and some measures 
probably will have been taken. 
  [Mu'addi] Don't you think that these proposals or conditions 
mean the reopening of the Oslo accord? 
  [Quray'] The Oslo accord is open in the first place, and it 
is being negotiated. What is proposed here is not amending it, 
but giving it dynamism and vitality. As is the case with any 
agreement, the stages of its negotiation and implementation 
create dynamism and vitality to make it succeed should there be 
any obstacles. So we are only opening the negotiations about 
settlement activity. Why not do this? This does not mean that 
the Oslo agreement has been rejected or that its file has been 
reopened, as has been said. Israel is attempting to go forward 
without resolving the problems obstructing implementation. This 
should not happen. 
  [Mu'addi] It was announced in Tunis today that a Palestinian 
committee of inquiry was formed to investigate the criminal 
incident in Hebron. What will this committee do and is it 
possible for it to cooperate with the Israeli counterpart 
committee? 
  [Quray'] It is simply a fact-finding committee to compile a 
complete file about this ugly, horrendous, unprecedented 
massacre. Regarding the possibility of cooperation, well, this 
committee is going to find all the facts and everything that is 
necessary to have all the information. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Ahmad Quray'. Thank you very much. 
  [Quray'] You are welcome.

  [Text] Damascus, 3 Mar (MENA)--Faruq Qaddumi, head of the 
PLO Political Department, has urged the United States and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to adopt tangible measures to give 
impetus to the peace process and make Israel implement the 
principles on which this progress is based, namely the exchange 
of land for peace and full withdrawal from the occupied Arab and 
Palestinian territories. 
  In a statement to MENA's Damascus correspondent, Qaddumi 
said 
that it is necessary to expedite the withdrawal from the 
Palestinian territories under the commitment made by Israel and 
witnessed by the United States on 13 September 1993. 
  Qaddumi added that it is also necessary to disarm the 
settlers and remove the political settlements that Rabin, when 
he became prime minister, said were dispensable. 
  Qaddumi, who is visiting Syria, affirmed that recent events 
have proven that the Zionist movement is a racist movement. He 
announced that the PLO will ask the United Nations to revive its 
resolution equating Zionism with racism, which the United States 
has tried to delete from UN records. 
  Qaddumi emphasized the need to create secure areas at 
friction points in the occupied Arab territories, notably in 
Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem. 
  He urged the international community to make serious efforts 
to encourage the peace process by adopting prompt decisions to 
dispatch international forces to protect the Palestinians living 
under occupation and to pressure Israel to make an immediate 
withdrawal. He said Jerusalem, Hebron, and Bethlehem must be 
placed under international protection until the final phase of 
the political settlement arrives. 
  Qaddumi said this final phase must come soon and that there 
is no need for a transitional period. 
  He pointed out that such prompt measures will encourage 
Palestinian-Israeli coexistence and warned that delay might 
inflame the region and pose a threat to security and peace. 
  Qaddumi urged the United States, in its capacity as peace 
sponsor, to shoulder a great responsibility and take concrete 
steps to give impetus to the peace operations, not merely issue 
an invitation for negotiations and seek to defuse international 
anger by such an invitation. 
  Qaddumi concluded his remarks by saying that the United 
States must adopt concrete measures, via the United Nations, to 
provide the necessary protection for the Palestinians and halt 
the Israeli settlers' criminal actions. He called for pressure 
on Israel to make it disarm the settlers and remove the 
political settlements.

  [Text] Amman--QUDS PRESS--The Hamas [Islamic Resistance] 
Movement has asked Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to step 
aside and resign his leadership of the Palestinian people, 
accusing him of representing only himself and an isolated group, 
which is oppressing our Palestinian people, as a responsible 
source in the movement said. 
  Commenting on a letter 'Arafat sent in response to a letter 
to him by Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, chief of the Hamas political 
bureau, the source said: 
  We in the Hamas Movement were astonished by the way 'Arafat 
replied to our letter in which we asked him to return to 
national ranks and make the courageous decision to withdraw from 
the negotiations. We believed the horrible massacre of 
worshipers in Hebron would shake 'Arafat to his foundations and 
prompt him to reconsider and withdraw from the negotiations. 
However, nothing of the kind happened. 'Arafat attempted to 
absorb the overwhelming popular indignation against his 
collapsing policy. 
  By saying in his letter that a deviation from his and the 
PLO's policy is a deviation from the national consensus, 'Arafat 
seems to be saying that the majority of the Palestinian people 
are outside the national consensus and that he regards only 
himself and his capitulating minority as the entire Palestinian 
people. This is gross contempt for our people and their 
fighting forces. It appears 'Arafat is unaware of the pulse of 
the indignant Palestinian masses who are angry with him and his 
capitulationist policy, and his shaky stand against the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. 
  The PLO's conditions for returning to negotiations are 
flimsy 
and cannot be compared with the size of the massacre. Yet 
'Arafat and his cohorts would soon decide to resume negotiations 
the moment their U.S. master makes a decision to this effect. 
  We ask 'Arafat to step aside and resign his leadership of 
the 
Palestinian people because he represents only himself and an 
isolated group that is oppressing our people. 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes herewith the verbatim text of 
'Arafat's letter in answer to the letter sent by the chief of 
the Hamas political bureau as disseminated by Palestinian 
embassies and press agencies: 
  I have read your letter on the deplorable massacre 
perpetrated by fanatic Israeli settlers, with the participation 
and support of Israeli Army units, against our steadfast, pious 
people who were kneeling in prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the 
city of Khalil al- Rahman [Abraham]. God said in his clear book 
of wisdom: But those who are slain in the way of God, He will 
never let their deeds be lost; soon will he guide them and 
improve their condition and admit them to the garden which he 
has announced for them. [Koranic verses] 
  This is the time for unity, solidarity, and unity of ranks 
and not for division and differences. We are now in need of 
unity and cohesion more than ever before because we are waging a 
very fierce battle to find a drastic and comprehensive solution 
to the problem of settlements and to disarming the settlers and 
to ensure international protection for our people. The souls of 
our pious martyrs, all of our martyrs, are beacons to light our 
path in order to enter Palestine raising the banners of Jihad, 
struggle, and victory. Our direction is holy Jerusalem, the 
first of the two qiblahs, the third holiest mosque, and the 
capital of our independent state. We are potential martyrs on 
the way to Palestine. Then give the glad tidings to the 
believers. [Koranic verse] 
  Palestine has returned to the political and geographical 
map, 
thanks to decades of Palestinian people's jihad and struggle on 
all levels and forums. The savage and deplorable murders 
committed by the fanatic extremists are a desperate attempt to 
prevent our people from reaching their national aims of ending 
the Israeli occupation and saving our Islamic and Christian holy 
places from the yoke of occupation and restoring our people's 
inalienable national rights, including their right to return, to 
exercise self-determination, and to establish their independent 
state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. 
  Palestine is the focus of our attention and the dearest 
place 
to our hearts. It is the bride whose dowry is paid by the lives 
of our men. Struggle and jihad will continue to regain it and 
realize just peace for it so that our Palestinian people will be 
able to live in peace, justice, and stability. Everyone is 
asked to stand together behind the PLO, our people's sole 
legitimate representative, in its policy and methods that have 
been approved by the our successive national councils. 
  To deviate from these policies is to deviate from the 
national consensus, causes great harm to our people's just 
cause. In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
And we shall try you until we test those among you who strive 
their utmost and persevere in patience, and we shall try your 
reported mettle. [Koranic verse] 
  We pray to almighty God to grant us one of the two favors: 
either victory or martyrdom.

<F P=106> [By 'Ala' al-Mashahrawi] </F>
  [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, a Fatah leader in the 
Gaza Strip, has described the steps taken by the Israeli 
Government in response to the Ibrahmi Mosque massacre as 
cosmetic steps and as an attempt to deflect the Palestinian and 
Arab peoples' anger. 
  Dr. al-Agha said that those steps are in no way sufficient 
and do not represent serious measures vis-a-vis the size of the 
tragedy that has taken place. He added that the release of a 
few hundred prisoners has no connection with any serious steps, 
especially as the prison term of most of those prisoners was 
about to end. 
  As for the Palestinian leadership's stance toward the 
painful 
massacre and the steps that it has taken, Dr. al-Agha said that 
the Palestinian leadership's response is somewhat acceptable and 
is epitomized by suspending the talks until two basic conditions 
are met. They are: 
  1. Placing the settlements issue as a top priority on the 
agenda and, ultimately, evacuating the settlements and disarming 
the settlers. 
  2. Imposing international protection, with UN supervision, 
in the occupied territories to ensure that the Palestinians live 
in peace and security.

  [Text] The hawks of the western sector of the Palestine 
National Liberation Movement (Fatah) have appealed to 
Arab--Druze and Bedouin--soldiers in the Israeli Army, who are 
working in what is called the Zionist border guard and security 
bodies, to rebel against their leadership in the Army and border 
guard. 
  A statement addressing these soldiers was distributed in 
Nabulus, Tulkarm, Hebron, and other cities. The statement says: 
Your history, dignity, Arabism, and Arab magnanimity require 
you to rebel. This call is a sincere invitation to rescue 
yourself from the quagmire of crime against our kinsfolk and 
clan. 
  The statement adds: Our call is genuine and does not stem 
from emotions. Throughout the years, we have persevered and we 
have suppressed our pain and sorrow as we saw part of our own 
people practice killing and terrorism against our people 
everywhere in southern Lebanon and Palestine. 
  The statement says: It is now time for you to return to your 
genuine Arab dignity and magnanimity that was upheld by the 
great struggler Sultan Pasha al-Atrash followed by the great 
struggler Kamal Junblat. Let those heroes be your paragon of 
honor and dignity. 
  The statement says colonialist invaders are evicted and 
defeated and oppressed people triumph. History tells us about 
the invaders and colonialists. Remember your ancestors at Jabal 
al-'Arab who, led by struggler Sultan Pasha al-'Atrash, defeated 
and evicted the French, just as they were evicted from Algeria 
and just as the United States left Vietnam in defeat. 
  Fatah hawks also sent a warning to settlers in the occupied 
Palestinian territories that says: As of 28 February, you are 
being pursued wherever you are. Our fighters will pursue you 
and the occupation army and other security bodies will not 
protect you. 
  The warning says: It is time for retribution. Your only 
chance is to immediately leave the settlements before it is too 
late. The warning adds: If you leave, you will survive. Leave 
the settlement immediately. Your life from now on will be at 
the mercy of our heroic men.

  [Text] In a statement distributed on 14 February, the 
Supreme Islamic Committee [SIC] in Jerusalem rejected Israeli 
proposals to discuss the future supervision of the Islamic holy 
shrines in the occupied territories, such as the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron, al-Nabi Yusuf Tomb in Nabulus, al-Nabi Samuil 
Mosque in Jerusalem, and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem, on the 
basis that these holy places are sacred to both Muslims and Jews. 
  The statement said: The Islamic mosques should not be a 
place of worship for non-Muslims. The mosques to which the 
proposals refer and that are mentioned in the statement are 
Islamic mosques built by Muslims. 
  The statement added: The current practices in the mosques 
are based on the force of the occupation. From the beginning, 
the SIC has objected to these practices, stressing its adherence 
to the Muslim holy shrines and mosques.

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Text] The collection of a million Palestinian signatures 
to a memorandum calling for an end to negotiations with Israel, 
unless it agrees to end all settlement activities and dismantle 
all settlements, has started. The signatures of Palestine 
National Council [PNC] members and national and popular figures 
to a similar memorandum has also started to be collected. The 
first memo, called "the National Consensus Document," was 
prepared by the Habash-led Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] and the Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] in the occupied Palestinian 
territories. Its final draft was worked out yesterday after 
consultations with the two fronts' leaders abroad. It reads as 
follows: 
  The ugly crime and horrendous massacre against the 
defenseless sons of our people in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque, in 
collusion with the occupation forces, is clear and unequivocal 
evidence of the premeditated intentions against the sons of our 
heroic Palestinian people and are meant to force them to 
relinquish their legitimate rights. Accordingly, we in the 
occupied Palestinian territories call for suspending the current 
negotiations until the following conditions are met: 
  1. Israel's explicit agreement to halt all settlement 
activities, expansion, and confiscation of lands. 
  2. A pledge to dismantle all settlements, considering them 
illegal according to the international legitimacy resolutions. 
  3. Rebuilding the negotiations on the basis of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy on the Palestine 
question. 
  4. Providing direct international protection for our people 
and their holy places, and forcing Israel to respect all 
international charters and norms, the Fourth Geneva Convention, 
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
  The document stressed that withdrawing from the occupied 
territories, guaranteeing our people's right to 
self-determination and the establishment of their independent 
state with Jerusalem as its capital, and implementing the 
resolutions of international legitimacy are considered a basic 
condition for the establishment of peace in the region. 
  The two fronts' representatives in the PNC also began to 
collect the signatures of the PNC members and national and 
popular figures on a similar memo prepared by Taysir Khalid from 
the DFLP, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh from the PFLP, and Sulayman 
al-Najjab from the Palestinian People's Party. Al-Najjab, 
however, disclaimed the memo in whose formulation he 
participated. The representatives of the three organizations 
drafted this memo after the failure of 120 PNC members in Jordan 
to agree to a joint stand toward the Hebron massacre. 
  The memo calls for and end to the current overt and covert 
bilateral talks with the Israeli enemy until the international 
community, particularly the Security Council, and Israel respond 
to our just demands which are: 
  1. Dismantling the settlements and stopping all settlement 
activities in accordance with the UN resolutions, particularly 
Security Council Resolution 465 for 1980, which considers these 
settlements illegal, and evacuating settlers from all the 
occupied Palestinian territories, including holy Jerusalem. 
  2. Securing international protection for our Palestinian 
people under occupation, applying the Fourth Geneva Convention 
of 1949 to the occupied territories, and entrusting security in 
the territories to UN forces for a temporary period of time 
until the Palestinian people can assume responsibility and 
national authority.

  [Text] News reports coming from New York indicate that the 
Security Council has failed to reach an agreement on issuing a 
resolution condemning the massacre committed by the Israeli 
terrorists against those who were praying at the honorable 
al-Haram al-Ibrahimi [mosque] that led to the fall of scores of 
victims among the praying Arab Palestinians. The Council had 
resorted to the adjournment of its session during the past days, 
at the request of the U.S. representative to the Council. 
  JANA Arab affairs editor has commented on this saying: 
  The failure of the so-called Security Council to condemn 
this 
savage massacre -- which constitutes one of the ugliest and 
dirtiest crimes of official terrorism -- exposes before the 
entire world the truth of this Council, which is controlled by 
the Christians and used by the crusader West as a tool to serve 
its interests and is a sword hanging over the necks of those who 
reject its blackmailing policies and refuse to give in to its 
will. 
  Although a week has elapsed since the savage massacre of 
al-Haram al-Ibrahimi -- and despite the clear evidence of 
official Israeli responsibility before the world for this 
terrorist crime that claimed as victims scores of Arab Muslim 
Palestinians while they prayed inside the Ibrahimi mosque -- the 
so-called Security Council is still postponing its session and 
is evading anything that will implicate the criminal Israelis, 
who are still shedding Arab Palestinian blood while the Council 
is claiming to be discussing the massacre. 
  The editor added that this exposed attitude by the so-called 
Security Council is the attitude of the West, which does not 
want to declare the truth and admit that what the Israelis have 
done was premeditated, official terrorism and a link within a 
long chain of Israeli acts of terrorism and thus to convict the 
Israelis of terrorism. 
  The editor stressed that this is another scandal of the 
so-called Security Council -- which holds immediate sessions and 
enthusiastically issues resolutions on sanctions and embargoes 
when the question is concerning the Arabs, applying the seventh 
chapter against them even when those resolutions are based on 
mere suspicion -- while witnessing with its own eyes one of the 
ugliest crimes of terrorism committed by the Israelis, openly 
and officially and before the entire world. Yet the Council 
refuses to issue even a denunciation of the criminals. It is a 
stand that cannot be explained except by the crusader West's 
indifference towards Arab lives and their blood, as if they were 
a race other than mankind. It is also an encouragement to the 
Israeli terrorists to commit more massacres against the 
Palestinian people. It is another indication regarding the 
extermination scheme being implemented against the Arabs and the 
Muslims by the Jewish-Christian alliance.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Black Friday--A Harbinger of More To Come"] </F>
  [Text] The racist, usurper Zionist regime allowed the 
massacre of more than 60 fasting Palestinian worshippers at the 
al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque and on the streets of Hebron last 
Friday. This is neither the first of such Zionist atrocities 
nor will it be the last to be committed by the hated and 
anti-Islamic savages in Tel Aviv. 
  In nearly 50 years of occupation of Muslim Palestine, 
international organizations, charged with safeguarding the 
security and territorial integrity of smaller countries, have 
turned a deaf ear to this injustice. 
  The illegal Jewish settlements populated by recent Russian 
and East European immigrants are ripe for physical violence 
because of social, religious, and cultural incompatibility of 
the Zionists with the indigenous Palestinian population. It was 
this incompatibility that lead to the Black Friday massacre of 
February 25. 
  Israel's refusal to abide by UN resolutions 242 and 338, and 
its subsequent settling of Russian and East European Jews in 
Arab lands created a common belief among the Zionist population 
that they can get away not only with stealing Palestine but also 
with the mass murder of Palestinian Muslims. 
  The selective and totally biased way in which the UN 
implements its own resolutions regarding Palestine is weighing 
heavily on the world's conscience, while the United States, as 
Israel's military supplier and financial supporter, bears the 
major share of guilt for Palestine's miseries as well as for 
this latest Zionist savagery. 
  The United States has been trying to create for itself the 
image of an honest broker in the Arab-Israeli conflict. America 
has been trying to convey to the Muslim world that its interest 
in brokering peace in the Middle East is based purely on 
humanitarian motives and is free of any political and financial 
considerations. But, the recent history of U.S. and Western 
European mediation in this conflict has proven that the West 
only acts when it is assured that the consequences of its 
actions are not against Israel or Western interests. 
  Transplanting a mostly Eastern European Jewish community to 
the heart of Muslim Middle East in 1948 was done by the UN under 
orders from the United States without any regard for the rights 
of the indigenous people of Palestine. 
  Considering the continued indifference of the West to the 
plight of the Palestinians, the time has come for the world's 
Muslims to take the initiative and begin implementing 
independent measures to resolve this historical injustice. 
  The world Muslims, particularly the Palestinians, can use 
their own potentials and capabilities derived from Islam and its 
traditions to reject those leaders who still believe in making 
peace with the butchers of Tel Aviv, and remove the Israeli 
cancer from the body of Islamic Middle East.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Political sources in Jerusalem yesterday said 
Israel and the PLO are holding contacts in an attempt to 
organize a meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo on 7 March. According to the 
sources, Peres will try to convince 'Arafat to immediately 
resume the peace talks. 
  Last Friday Peres conveyed a message to 'Arafat via Greek 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Foreign Minister Peres 
urged the PLO chairman to immediately resume the negotiations 
and offered him a "package of steps" Israel is willing to 
implement. Among these steps are accelerating the withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho in an attempt to complete it by 13 April, 
granting the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho immediate 
authority and increasing the size of this police force, and 
deploying international observers in Gaza and Jericho. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 6 March 
broadcasts a report by political correspondent Udi Segal on the 
proposed Israeli steps, adding that "Foreign Minister Peres says 
that in addition to the above proposals, Israel will agree to 
discuss additional demands and has some more proposals of its 
own. He emphasized, however, that Israel will not agree to 
illogical demands such as the dismantling of settlements and 
disarming all the settlers." In recorded remarks, Peres says: 
"We distinguish between useful and senseless demands. We will 
examine every demand and will not oppose anything which can help 
calm tempers and facilitate the peace process." Asked to 
elaborate, Peres adds: "We will not oppose strengthening the 
Palestinian police force. Also, when there is a curfew in an 
Arab village we will object to armed settlers entering it and 
other things of this nature."] 
  Peres told Papoulias it is possible to complete the 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho within three to four weeks. 
Prime Minister Rabin told the Greek foreign minister, on the 
other hand, that between three to four weeks will be required 
for finalizing and signing the agreement with the PLO, whereas 
the implementation of the agreement will require six more weeks. 
  According to Israeli political sources the U.S. 
Administration has made it clear to the PLO -- via meetings 
between senior State Department officials and Nabil Sha'th -- 
that the United States has no intention of getting actively 
involved in the negotiations. According to reports which have 
reached Jerusalem, the Americans told Sha'th -- who demanded 
that settlements such as Netzarim and the Jewish settlement in 
Hebron be dismantled -- that they will accept "whatever you 
conclude with Israel." 
  The PLO has sent its delegates to an agricultural conference 
in Cordova, Spain, attended by regional experts in the framework 
of the multilateral peace talks. Aside from the Palestinians 
and Israelis, representatives of Arab countries participating in 
the multilateral talks also attended the meeting. Israeli 
sources last week expressed the fear that the delay in the 
bilateral talks would also suspend the multilateral talks.

<H5>  GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS </H5>
  In its 24 February issue, the opposition AL-USRAH 
AL-'ARABIYAH publishes on page 7 an approximately 1,500-word 
report by 'Ala' Tawfiq on human rights violations in Egypt, 
which the writer says "cannot be worse." Against pictures of a 
bearded Islamist behind bars and defendants being led to court, 
the report cites several human rights activists on torture of 
detainees, forced confessions, application of emergency laws, 
and degradation of man's humanity. Najad al-Bura'i, secretary 
general of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization, refutes 
government allegations that human rights groups defend criminals 
and ignore the rights of victims. He says: "We defend and urge 
protection of defendants as humans. We do not seek to prevent 
their trial or punishment, nor do we want to affect trials. We 
demand protection of defendants as human beings; we want to 
protect their human and legal rights." Asked whether Egypt 
observes human rights in a satisfactory manner, al-Bura'i -- 
according to the writer -- "was content with only a sarcastic 
smile." 
  Muhsin 'Awad, assistant secretary of the Arab Human Rights 
Organization, notes violation of rights such as arrest and 
torture of workers on strike and the existence of laws 
conflicting with international conventions. He concludes: "I 
tell those who say that human rights in Egypt are observed well 
that they are illusioned, tendentious, and deviants from the 
truth." 
  Dr. Ahmad al-Majdub, of the National Center for Criminal 
Research, urges fair trials in civilian courts, "not by a 
military judge who takes orders." Challenging official 
statements on respect for human rights, al-Majdub rhetorically 
asks: "Do attacking houses without strong incriminating 
evidence, referring cases to military courts, preventing defense 
lawyers from seeing documents, denying defendants the right to 
appear before civilian judges, and applying the emergency law 
for many years indicate respect for, or even presence of, human 
rights?" 
  --In a separate 1,000-word column on the same page, the 
paper 
publishes "examples of torture victims," giving names and cases 
of a number of people who were tortured in police centers, some 
of whom died as a result. The paper cites official forensic 
medicine reports to substantiate its claims. 
  --In a related 200-word news report on page 1, the paper 
says 
security campaigns in the southern governorate of Asyut have 
been seeing "brutal practices and serious excesses against 
women, old men, and children." The paper says raids on houses 
are carried out at random, with police breaking down doors and 
forcing young men to leave their houses and take off their 
clothes amid floods of harassment and oaths to force them to 
give information. The report says that in their raids, police 
forces arrest hundreds of innocent people and detain them in 
camps in Asyut without giving reasons. The police reportedly 
seize private passenger vehicles to use in their campaigns. The 
report cites a National Democratic Party official in Asyut as 
warning against the repercussions of these security campaigns, 
noting that they make people sympathetic to the Islamic Group's 
violence. "The barbaric police acts have only increased 
violence," the official is quoted as saying. 
  --Another 100-word news report on page 1 says security 
forces 
raided a girls' high school last week to force veiled students 
to remove their veils despite a court decision allowing the 
practice. The report notes that the education minister had 
objected to the court decision and decided to appeal. 

<H5>    RECOGNITION OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD URGED </H5>
  A 300-word article by Mahmud Yasir Ramadan, the newspaper's 
board chairman, urges that the Muslim Brotherhood be included in 
the national dialogue due to take place in April because the 
group, whether the government likes it or not, "is an 
influential political force" in the country. Noting that all 
opposition parties recognize the Muslim Brotherhood as a 
political force, not as a charity or service society, Ramadan 
says it is high time the ruling National Democratic Party did 
the same. "If we want the dialogue to succeed and effectively 
achieve results to save the homeland and its citizens from the 
negative consequences of extremist ideas, then we must accept 
moderate political forces, no matter what their inclinations," 
he writes. To support his call, Ramadan maintains that "failure 
to grant the Muslim Brotherhood official or semi- official 
recognition is the primary reason for the emergence of the 
political violence groups, which we call terrorist or extremist 
groups." 
<H5>  ISLAMISTS WIN, CONTEST TRADE UNION ELECTIONS; WRITER COMMENTS </H5>
  On page 9, which is devoted to news of trade unions and 
professional associations, the paper reports a "major victory" 
for the Islamic trend in the election of the Agronomists 
Association. It says that for the first time in the history of 
the association, the Islamic trend won the majority of seats in 
the mid-term renewal elections in most of the country's 
governorates. The paper comments: "The big victory reflects 
the people's genuine longing for the Islamic solution." It 
claims that the victory was achieved despite administrative 
pressure from Agriculture Ministry officials and threats to 
supporters of the Islamic trend. 
  --Other reports say that the Islamic trend will lead the 
Lawyers Association elections in Cairo and al-Jizah on 17 March, 
and will contest the Pharmacists mid-term renewal elections on 
29 March. 
  --An approximately 800-word article by Dr. Faruq 
'Abd-al-Salam on page 4 comments on the Islamic trend's 
successes in trade union elections. He notes the failure of the 
government's effort to curb these successes when it introduced a 
professional associations election law "that was especially 
designed to combat the Muslim Brotherhood trend" under the 
pretext of serving the general interest. 'Abd-al-Salam argues: 
"Today, the Islamic trend sticks in the throat of the ruling 
regime. The Islamic trend is exposing the regime's claims of 
democracy, and the ruling party's claim that it enjoys a 
majority." "It is futile, ridiculous, and surprising," the 
writer adds, "for the ruling party to claim any majority of any 
kind when it cannot, no matter what influence and deviant 
methods it uses, win one-tenth of what the Islamists win in the 
professional associations." The writer sees irony in the fact 
that while the regime is claiming democracy, "the trend enjoying 
true majority in these sensitive positions is the only trend 
denied the right to form a political party." 
<H5>  WRITER NOTES PLANS TO IMPROVE TIES WITH ISRAEL </H5>
  An approximately 1,500-word article by Fathi al-Mansuri on 
page 7 discusses prospects of Egypt's Middle East policies in 
the near future as concluded from articles published in 
government newspapers. The writer particularly summarizes or 
gives excerpts from two lengthy articles by AL-AHRAM Chief 
Editor Ibrahim Nafi' on 11 and 18 February calling for joint 
projects and warmer relations with Israel to serve Egypt's 
interests. 
  The writer, making little comment, says such articles 
normally reflect official policy and pave the way for certain 
future measures. He says Nafi' articles stress that "what was 
being discussed as merely a possibility and 
speculation--normalization with Israel, removal of the boycott, 
and the Jewish entity playing its role, especially through 
economic Middle Eastern projects--is virtually becoming true." 
<H5>  CONSPIRACY AGAINST ISLAMIC EDUCATION </H5>
  An approximately 1,000-word report by Hani al-Makkawi 
reviews 
what the writer terms a "conspiracy against education" to 
obliterate Islamic identity and entrench Western culture. The 
report also contains tables showing the percentage of Islamic 
material deleted from textbooks. It cites an al-Azhar 
educational official as saying that "under the current education 
minister, everything related to Islamic, Arab, and national eras 
has been deleted from textbooks." He gives examples of several 
deletions from Islamic and pan-Arab subjects to show that the 
purpose is "to open the door wide to the Americans and Jews." 
An Islamic history professor is also cited on attempts "to 
distort Islamic history under the pretext of modernization" of 
the educational curricula. 

<H5>    AL-GHAZALI URGES ISLAMIC UPBRINGING </H5>
  A 2,500-word report by Yasir al-Dukkani on page 8 discusses 
a 
seminar on Islamic culture attended by Islamic preacher Shaykh 
Muhammad al-Ghazali and several other Islamic scholars. The 
report cites Shaykh al-Ghazali as stressing the importance of 
Islamic upbringing to solve the Islamic nation's problems and 
stop its defeats. Al-Ghazali also stresses that Islam must not 
be viewed narrowly where marginal differences and minor details 
not affecting the essence of Islam are highlighted. Al-Ghazali 
is cited as saying: "I used to fight on two fronts: communism 
and stagnation, and today I am also fighting on two fronts, 
secularism and extremism." He adds: "This nation must return 
to its origins and first culture. Islam does not know 
nationalities or imported ideas. Anyone taking Islam or the 
return to it lightly is an apostate." 
<H5>  WRITERS REFUTE SECULARISTS CLAIMS </H5>
  Two articles of about 1,500-words each on page 8 react to 
"slanders" by secularist writers and their accusations that the 
Islamic culture is closed-minded. The first article, by Yasir 
al-Rikani, cites some Islamist thinkers as defending Islamic 
thought, its openness to other cultures, and its call for using 
the mind. 
  At the end of the second article, in which writer Dr. Ahmad 
'Abd-al-Rahman refutes a claim by secular writer Dr. Fu'ad 
Zakariya that the principles of Islam conflict with the 
causality theory, the writer says: "We know for sure that 
Western media will not stop their attacks on Muslims until they 
abandon Islam and embrace the infidel materialistic philosophy, 
thus losing their intellectual independence and distinguished 
identity and becoming submissive slaves to the West, like the 
Red Indians." 
<H5>  WRITER URGES CONFORMITY BETWEEN LAWS AND SHARI'AH </H5>
  A 500-word article entitled "The Citizen and the Law" by Dr. 
al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Miliji on page 4 notes that citizens 
are living in fear most of the time because they wonder whether 
things they do violate some law or another. This is a result of 
much harassment and accusations, he says. "We hope that the 
laws, legislated in dark ages to oppress and frighten citizens 
into becoming tools in the hand of rulers, will be realigned," 
he writes. He adds: "There is hope that the laws will be put in 
harmony with our [Islamic] creed so that there will be no 
conflict between what we believe and what is imposed on us under 
the so-called laws." 
<H5>  ISLAM AND THE FAMILY </H5>
  Page 3 features a report and two columns on the Muslim 
family 
and the importance of keeping it cohesive. Writers maintain 
that Islam protects women's rights and safeguards their status 
in society. The approximately 3,000-word report by Hisham Khadr 
laments the fact that Egyptian men are allowing their wives or 
daughters to travel abroad for work. It cites experts and 
specialists as saying that this helps in the collapse of 
families and other social problems. Contending that Islam does 
not allow women to travel abroad unaccompanied by a male member 
of the family, the writer wonders how men could possibly allow 
their wives, sisters, or daughters to travel abroad on their 
own: "Where is dignity, gallantry, manhood, religion?" he 
bitterly asks. 
<H5>  WESTERN INTENTIONS IN BOSNIA DOUBTED </H5>
  A 500-word article by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah on page 5 
argues 
that the Western intervention in Bosnia is aimed at stopping the 
successes that the Muslim Bosnians have recently been making. 
The writer says the NATO threat basically aimed at preventing 
Muslims from using their main weapon--heavy artillery--while 
only collecting the Serbs' heavy weapons in certain places where 
they can be used against Muslims in other Bosnian cities. 
  In another 600-word article on page 10, Chief Editor Mahmud 
'Atiyah also casts doubts on Western intentions in Bosnia but 
mainly assails the position of Russia, which he says wanted to 
revive its lost glory "at the expense of the cheap Muslim 
blood." He also attacks the UN secretary general's position on 
Bosnia and urges Muslim peoples to give donations for their 
Muslim brothers in Bosnia.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 March 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Writers React to Ibrahimi Mosque Massacre 
  2. Enlightenment Convoy Discusses Hebron Massacre, 
Satellite 
  Dish 
  3. Al-Azhar Students Denounce Hebron Massacre, Demand 
Israeli 
  Ambassador's Expulsion 
  4. Grand Imam Urges Youth To Seek Knowledge 
  5. Seminar Discusses Extremism, Conflict With West 
<H5>  WRITERS REACT TO IBRAHIMI MOSQUE MASSACRE </H5>
  The 1 March edition of the state-owned religious weekly 
'AQIDATI features several articles, commentaries, and reports 
that react to the "Ibrahimi Mosque massacre" and its 
repercussions. 
  In his 350-word column on page 1, Chairman of the Board 
Samir 
Rajab says he refuses to believe that the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre was committed by an individual or group of individuals. 
"It is an entangled conspiracy that involves several powers, 
including Israel's Army in its entirety as well as its 
government, because, unfortunately, they do not want this nation 
to advance or flourish," he argues. 
  Noting that U.S. and NATO threats were heard only after 
everything was lost in Muslim Bosnia-Herzegovina, Rajab affirms 
that the same thing will happen to the Palestinians, "unless 
positive international protection is provided for them through 
firm, effective, and rigid measures." He suggests that the lack 
of Arab and Islamic solidarity will further aggravate things 
and, admitting that "peace is essential," emphasizes that this 
peace must be based on justice. He warns that "any aggression 
against Islam will lead to a very severe and violent reaction." 
  Basyuni al-Halwani's 400-word column on page 6 contends that 
the massacre proves to the world that "God's chosen people are 
the most deceptive and treacherous and they break promises." He 
hopes the states that defend Israeli terrorism and back their 
crimes would "review their biased policy, abandon their support 
for injustice and aggression, and turn over a new leaf on Muslim 
issues" by dealing fairly with them. 
  Al-Halwani believes it is unlikely that the culprits will 
get 
their fair share of punishment, despite the growing world anger. 
Citing the Bosnian example in this context, he remarks: "The 
world tolerates and encourages Jews to commit their crimes, as 
long as these crimes are being committed against Muslims." 
  He wonders whether Muslims will suffice themselves with 
condemnation and denunciation after the massacre or will "wake 
up, quit their differences and imaginative battles," and adopt 
firmer decisions. He appeals to Muslims to "wake up before it 
is too late," contending that Muslim blood has become "the 
cheapest on earth." 
  Majdi Salim's 400-word article on page 10 views the issue in 
another perspective, picturing the world as a "chessboard" 
controlled by "a single, very skillful player"--the United 
States. 
  Simplifying his idea, Salim writes: The "first act of the 
world farce" opened with the "Serbian barbarians'" bombardment 
of the market place in Sarajevo. The West threatened, the 
Islamic world denounced and condemned, and NATO addressed an 
ultimatum to the Serbs, he says. 
  The "second act" was opened by Russia, "which is now begging 
from America." Redeploying the Serbian troops, Russia compelled 
the West not to launch an air strike against Serbs, he says. 
  Still in the second act, Salim writes that a Jewish 
terrorist 
committed a heinous crime in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The 
writer states: "The chess player who moves the pieces wants to 
close the second act of the farce without harming genuine world 
terrorism and its architect, the state with the six-sided star," 
he writes. 
  "The skillful player begins the third act of the farce by 
offering a toy to Muslims to play with, forget the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, and hail the civilized West, which carried out 
its threat and shot down four Serbian planes as they were 
bombarding Muslims in Sarajevo," Salim concludes. 
  In a 150-word commentary on page 20, 'Adil Dayf writes that 
the massacre came as no surprise to those who follow "the 
Israelis' criminal history." Emphasizing that "these criminals 
must be isolated completely, surrounded, abandoned, and punished 
severely," he stresses that "sanctions must involve the Israeli 
Government, which encourages such crimes against Muslims." He 
warns that failure to punish the criminals will encourage the 
recurrence of crimes. 
  Ashraf Abu-al-Hawl's 300-word article on page 20 contends 
that "no matter how many decisions are taken to disarm the 
extremist settlers, the Israeli Government will be unable to 
stop Zionist massacres, since it is very easy for the crazy 
murderers who believe in the supremacy of the Jewish race to 
conceal weapons." 
  Recalling that the intifadah ensued following a similar 
massacre by the settlers in Gaza in December 1987, Abu-al-Hawl 
states: "There will be no peace between the Palestinians and 
Israelis unless the Zionist settlements are totally removed." 
  A 250-word commentary by Ibrahim Nasr on page 23 claims the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is only "a link in the chain of 
notorious massacres committed once in a while--after accurate 
calculations and at set times--to determine the extent to which 
the cold parts of the Arab nation's body will heat up." 
  He remarks that it is "no longer acceptable to hear the 
phrase `land for peace' with Israel, since Israel owns the land 
through occupation and controls its people." What war does 
Israel fear now that it has made real peace with the heart of 
the Arab nation and its long arm?, he asks. 
  Doubting that the intifadah can shake Israel, he notes that 
Israeli media try to present the issue in this light to justify 
the criminal acts. 
  Al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Ra'uf opens his 500-word column on page 24 
with the remark: "How cheap Muslim blood has become." Claiming 
inaction by the "new world order" over the killing of dozens of 
Muslims in Sarajevo by "the Serbian pigs," he refers to a "new 
crime in the long chain of Zionist crimes against Arabs in 
general and Palestinians in particular." 
  He contends that the principles and strategies that govern 
the Israeli mentality have not changed since the state of Israel 
was established almost 50 ago. 
  "Unless this mentality is changed, the reality will not 
change, the bloody incidents will not stop, the file of violence 
and terrorism will not be closed, and real peace will not be 
established for either Arabs or Israelis," he says. He adds 
that the Israeli mentality will not change unless Arabs develop 
the ability to refuse and to act. "Until this happens, Muslim 
blood will remain cheap," he concludes. 
<H3>  ENLIGHTENMENT CONVOY DISCUSSES HEBRON MASSACRE, SATELLITE 
DISH </H3>
  Muhammad al-Abnudi reports on the "enlightenment convoy" 
that 
the Awqaf minister leads around the Republic. In a 700-word 
report on page 2, al-Abnudi writes that scholars and lecturers 
affirmed in their meeting with the masses in al-Sharqiyah 
Governorate that the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is "a mark of 
disgrace on the forehead of the Islamic nation and proof to 
everyone that terrorist operations are not launched by Muslims 
as the West claims." 
  The report adds that the masses denounced this vicious 
aggression and stressed the need to support Jerusalem's Muslims 
and give top priority to finding solutions for the problems. 
  The report adds that the meeting discussed other issues, 
including Egypt's stance on the massacres to which Bosnian 
Muslims are being subjected. Asked about Egypt's role in this 
connection, Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab 
highlights that "Egypt needs domestic stability to play its role 
best." 
  The meeting raised the issue of the Western media and 
receiving programs by satellite dish. Asked about this, Amin 
Basyuni, Radio and Television Union chairman, remarks: "The 
problem does not lie in the dish but in how we handle it, since 
we cannot isolate ourselves from the world." He believes that 
there is no alternative for building "a strong, Muslim, Egyptian 
man" who can distinguish right from wrong. 
<H5>  AL-AZHAR STUDENTS DENOUNCE MASSACRE, DEMAND ISRAELI </H5>
  AMBASSADOR'S EXPULSION 
  A 100-word report on page 3 says that over 10,000 students 
in 
al- Azhar University staged "a peaceful demonstration" on 27 
February to denounce the Hebron massacre. 
  The report adds that "a statement by the student union 
condemned the incident and demanded the expulsion of the Israeli 
ambassador." 
<H5>  GRAND IMAM URGES YOUTH TO SEEK KNOWLEDGE </H5>
  In the 3d of a series of articles, al-Azhar Grand Imam 
Shaykh 
Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq urges youth to seek knowledge and 
use it to enhance their nation's strength and lead it to 
progress. In his 1,000-word article on page 3, he cites 
examples from Islamic history to show that the Islamic nation 
has always respected its knowledgeable and pious youth. 
<H5>  SEMINAR DISCUSSES EXTREMISM, CONFLICT WITH THE WEST </H5>
  A 3,000-word report on page 4 gives an account of a seminar 
'AQIDATI organized in the Flying Institute in al-Sharqiyah under 
the banner "Ramadan, the Month of Mercy and Sympathy." 
  Speaking at the seminar, Chief Editor al-Sayyid 
'Abd-al-Ra'uf 
is cited affirming that Egypt is "in good shape" and that 
"extremism is an exception." 
  Al-Azhar Professor Dr. Muhammad Fayid Haykal replied to a 
question on "how to restore the Islamic nation's lost glory amid 
imported currents." He is quoted as saying that this can only 
be achieved by "raising our children according to sound Islamic 
principles." Noting that the conflict between the Islamic 
nation and the West is a cultural and intellectual one, he 
called for "directing the youth to the intellectual and cultural 
sides of Islam" so that they can read and understand Islam 
properly and help their nation to assume its rightful place in 
the world. 
  The seminar also discusses fasting and its effect on 
Muslims.

  [Text] Brother leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] met U.S. 
Ambassador in Tunis John McCarthy yesterday evening. During the 
meeting, they reviewed the latest political developments and the 
dimensions and repercussions on the peace process and the 
current negotiations of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi mosque 
perpetrated by Zionist settlers. 
  They also reviewed the deliberations of the UN Security 
Council regarding a resolution on the massacre perpetrated by 
the settlers, the need to guarantee international protection for 
our Palestinian people, and the disarming of the Zionist 
settlers so that such a massacre would not be repeated. 
  They also reviewed the Palestinian-U.S. meeting chaired by 
Dr. Nabil Sha'th [as heard], which is currently being held with 
U.S. officials in Washington so that the Security Council can 
come up with an effective resolution. 
  The meeting was attended on the Palestinian side by brother 
Abu-Lutf [Faruq Qaddumi], the head of the PLO Political 
Department, Brother Hayil al-Fahum, the head of the European

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of 
the state of Palestine and head of the PLO Executive Committee, 
has received special Russian envoy Igor Ivanov, who has been 
visiting Israel. The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, indicated 
that Ivanov acquainted brother Abu-'Ammar with the outcome of 
his talks with the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar laid out for the Russian envoy the PLO's 
basic demand that protection for the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories be ensured before the talks can be resumed. 
Brother Abu-'Ammar reiterated the PLO's position that the 
United Nations must secure protection for the Palestinians and 
disarm Jewish settlers. The brother president, WAFA adds, told 
the Russian envoy he was disturbed that the UN Security Council 
found it hard to pass a resolution that would make it possible 
for the peace talks to resume and for secure protection for the 
Palestinians throughout the occupied territories to be ensured. 
The meeting took place in a cordial atmosphere and demonstrated 
that the Palestinian and Russian viewpoints were identical. 
  According to a Palestinian source, brother Abu-'Ammar 
earlier 
received the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, John McCarthy, to discuss 
continuing consultations about a UN Security Council resolution 
on the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Russia is widely thought to be 
in favor of a resolution providing for international protection 
for the Palestinians in the occupied territories, while the 
United States and Israel are opposed.

  [Text] According to Israeli radio, the PLO and the Israeli 
Government are holding contacts about a possible meeting today 
or tomorrow between brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and 
Shim'on Peres, who will try to talk him into resuming the 
negotiations. Peres sent a message to brother Abu-'Ammar 
regarding expediting the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area, boosting the size of the Palestinian police force, 
taking over immediate [as heard] responsibility for the Strip 
and Jericho, and the deployment of international observers in 
the projected Palestinian self-rule area.

  [Text] Cairo, March 6 (AFP)--The PLO on Sunday [6 March] 
ruled out a meeting between its leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres because of the tensions stirred 
by the Hebron massacre. 
  The Israeli newspaper HA'ARETZ reported that Peres wanted to 
meet 'Arafat in Cairo on Monday to put the peace talks back on 
track. 
  "The atmosphere is not suitable for such a meeting," the PLO 
representative to Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP, referring to the 
February 25 mosque massacre in Hebron on the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank. 
  Kamal criticized the UN Security Council, which has been in 
session for the last week, for "not adopting a resolution 
condemning Israel after the massacre." 
  The proposed resolution condemning the massacre by an 
Israeli 
settler has been held up by a disagreement between the PLO and 
United States over a reference to Jerusalem and to an 
international presence in the occupied territories. 
  HA'ARETZ said the call for an 'Arafat-Peres meeting was 
passed on to the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Tunis by 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, who has been touring 
the Middle East. 
  Peres said meanwhile that Israel was ready to respond to the 
Palestinian conditions for a resumption of the autonomy talks 
which were broken off in the wake of the mosque carnage. 
  "We have no reason to oppose demands which can advance the 
peace process and calm the situation," he told Israeli radio. 
  "We can for example agree to enlarge the ranks of the 
Palestinian police and to ban armed settlers from entering a 
Palestinian village under curfew," said Peres, who signed a 
security deal with 'Arafat in Cairo on February 9. 
  'Arafat was expected in the Egyptian capital later Sunday 
for 
talks with President Husni Mubarak on the Hebron massacre. 
  He was also due to meet Nabil Sha'th, his political adviser, 
who travelled to Washington last week for talks with US 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the Palestinian 
demands, said Kamal. 
  The PLO wants Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and West 
Bank 
to be disarmed after a settler shot dead dozens of Muslim 
worshipers in Hebron. 
  It has also called for international protection and the 
dismantling of some Jewish settlements, notably Qiryat Arba' 
near Hebron, where mosque killer Barukh Goldstein lived, and 
settlements in the town centre. 
  Peres told the US television network CNN on Saturday that 
Israel accepted Palestinian demands for security guarantees, 
including the presence of international observers, but the 
details would have to be discussed. He was in favour of "the 
presence of a temporary foreign or international group" in the 
territories. 
  But Prime Minister 'Yitzhak Rabin has ruled out any armed 
observers saying the only international role in the territories 
would be to monitor how the Palestinians spend money from donor 
countries during autonomy.

  [Text] Both the PLO leadership and the Israeli Government 
want to restart the peace process, but the question is to what 
extent Israel thinks it can meet the PLO's demands. We will 
first go over to Oslo, which is being visited by PLO negotiators: 
  [Correspondent Johan Fredriksson] The PLO's main condition 
for resuming the peace talks is that armed UN supervisors should 
be stationed in the occupied territories. It does not have to 
be a big force, the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
when he visited Oslo today. 
  [Begin Sha'th recording, in English] We are not calling for 
a 
major army of separation. We need the presence--the strong, 
effective presence--of people who know about security, and that 
is, I think, why we needed armed observers. [end recording] 
  [Fredriksson] In addition to this, however, the Israeli 
Government must, on the one hand, put an end to the violence 
that its own army uses in Gaza and on the West Bank. On the 
other hand, it must also disarm the militant settlers in the 
regions, Sha'th says. 
  [Begin Sha'th recording, in English] Half the element is to 
have an international presence; the other half is to have an 
Israeli restriction of the settler violence. [end recording] 
  [Fredriksson] This is Johan Fredriksson in Oslo.

  [Excerpt] Ramallah, QUDS PRESS -- Professor Bassam Jarrar 
and Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, Palestinian negotiators in the talks 
for implementing the self-rule accord, have warned against 
"capitulating" to Israeli demands regarding the release of 
prisoners in return for providing protection to collaborators 
with the Israeli forces. 
  Bassam Jarrar, a leading Ramallah dignitary, has said that 
"Israel is interested in providing protection for its agents." 
He pointed out that giving guarantees that no harm will befall 
collaborators with the occupation in exchange for the release of 
detainees held by the authorities aims at "encouraging those 
individuals and others to collaborate with Israel." He added: 
This will set a dangerous precedent that will help Israel to 
continue recruiting collaborators even after the self-rule 
accord is implemented. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Information Department Head Yasir </F>
'Abd-Rabbuh by unidentified reporter in Paris on 4 March -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Mr. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO 
Information Department, following the Hebron massacre and within 
the framework of the PLO campaign to explain its demands for 
resuming the negotiations with Israel, you are now visiting 
Paris, and you met with officials here. What topics were 
discussed and what stands were expressed? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, a meeting was held with the French 
foreign and defense ministers. At this meeting, we explained 
the stand of the Palestinian command, emphasizing the need to 
provide all security guarantees for the Palestinian citizens in 
the occupied territories as a necessary step before the peace 
process is resumed. At the forefront of these demands is the 
issue of ending settlement activities, the armed presence of the 
settlers, and some settlement centers that are a real obstacle 
and a time bomb threatening any peace arrangements that could be 
reached. At the same time, we must not forget the importance of 
the presence of international forces in the occupied territories 
with full authorization from the UN Security Council to carry 
out their role of safeguarding security and monitoring Israeli 
respect for the security of the Palestinian people and their 
rights. I can say that the French and Palestinian stands on 
these points are in agreement, and that France is playing its 
role as the current UN Security Council president by issuing a 
UN Security Council resolution that will help us start 
implementing such arrangements and measures. 
  [Reporter] Has France agreed to send international forces to 
the occupied territories? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] France today said that it agrees to an 
effective international presence in the occupied territories 
authorized by the UN Security Council and the United Nations, 
and that this international presence should have a practical 
role in preventing any violations against the Palestinian 
people, particularly after the massacre that was committed in 
Hebron one week ago. 
  [Reporter] What capitals will you visit after France? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Today, we will also meet with the EC 
leadership 
in Brussels, and with the Belgian foreign minister. We will 
explain the Palestinian stand within the framework of common 
action with Europe and all other forces eager to preserve the 
peace process and have it proceed without impediments and 
without any mines being laid on the road, such as the presence 
of the Israeli terrorists, the settlers, and the extremist 
forces that support them. 
  [Reporter] The international envoys that have traveled to 
Tunis to meet with the Palestinians and to Israel, including the 
Russian envoy and the Greek envoy, whose country chairs the EC, 
have urged the Palestinian and Israeli sides to resume the 
negotiations. When do you expect the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations will resume? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] We seek to resume the negotiations as soon as 
possible. However, the resumption of the negotiations calls for 
real guarantees. The question is not one of sitting around a 
table only. The question is to reach, on the ground, a secure 
and sound state of affairs with respect to the Palestinian 
citizens, a situation that does not expose them to the Israeli 
terrorism at any moment. 
  [Reporter] Are you satisfied with the development of the 
international stand in this respect? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] We believe that most of those who represent 
the 
international stand are sympathetic and understand the realism 
of the Palestinian stand and Palestinian demands, as well as the 
Palestinian side's concern over the peace process and its 
continuation. The international stand now completely 
understands that the obstacles placed by the terrorist settlers 
and others should be completely removed so that the peace 
process may be resumed, and so that steps and measures can be 
taken on the road to implementing the peace agreement and not 
only to sit at the table of negotiations. 
  [Reporter] Reports from Israel speak of a serious dialogue 
between the Rabin government and the extremist right-wing party 
Tzomet to have it join the coalition government. Tzomet's 
stands are known to be against the autonomy agreement and to 
support the presence of the settlements, not to mention the 
other extremist stands. What do the Palestinians think about 
this development? 
  ['Abd-Rabbuh] Of course, this is a negative development. The 
strange thing is that Rabin's government, which claims it is 
against extremism, seeks to deal with extremism by resorting to 
more extremism. We are closely watching this issue, especially 
since the differences between Eytan, Kahane, and the other 
extremist gangs are minor. They all agree on the same platform 
-- on adopting a racist stand against the Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman </F>
al-Najjab by Tawfiq 'Abid, "at his residence" on 5 March] 
  [Text] ['Abid] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has dealt a 
severe blow to Palestinian action at this stage. Is it possible 
to contain the effects of this massacre? How? 
  [Al-Najjab] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre cannot be 
contained. The same goes for the continuing massacre committed 
by the Israeli Army all over our occupied territories. The 
effects of what happened cannot be contained on the Palestinian, 
Arab, Israeli, and international levels. Any attempt to bypass 
the massacre, similar to what Israel and the United States are 
trying to do, will result in the failure of the peace process. 
  There is a national Palestinian consensus on the need to 
suspend the negotiations and to have a more serious stand toward 
this far-reaching Israeli crime. The crime has raised again the 
question of providing security and protection for the victimized 
Palestinian people, and not for the Israeli settlers and Army, 
who carried out this massacre. 
  This is not the first massacre the Israeli occupation 
committed against our people that has elicited worldwide 
condemnation and anger. The Israeli side, however, has 
continued to get away with these massacres. 
  All sincere people should now work to prevent the repetition 
of this bestial crime. This is very important. Another point 
is that the impact of this massacre on the negotiating process, 
as well as Israel's actual stand -- apart from sympathy -- 
should be assessed. 
  This massacre and subsequent developments have cast a heavy 
shadow on the entire negotiating process. Regrettably, the U.S. 
position, which has not stopped being hostile to our people 
despite the end of the Cold War, is still keeping the Security 
Council and the world community from taking the necessary steps 
to prevent a repeat of this crime. The Security Council has 
been holding deliberations for a second week without reaching a 
serious resolution in this regard. 
  The Palestinian side and the other Arab brothers should 
reflect on what happened and draw lessons about the true U.S. 
position and how to deal with it as it is without embellishing 
it. 
  We should consider that the European and Russian positions 
are better than the U.S. position, which still insists on 
imposing an Israeli solution on all Palestinians and Arabs and 
which is playing a serious role in obstructing the progress of 
negotiations. 
  On the Palestinian level, whether the negotiations continue 
or not, the question of ensuring protection for the Palestinian 
people and stopping the crimes committed against them must top 
the agenda of the Palestinian leadership. 
  In the aftermath of the massacre, the Rabin government has 
imposed a curfew and comprehensive siege against more than two 
million Palestinians under occupation. The Israeli side has 
also adopted other measures to fully isolate Jerusalem from the 
rest of our occupied territory and to bolster its annexation to 
Israel. In addition, the confiscation of territory and 
expansion of settlements has not stopped. More than 10,000 
Palestinians remain in the occupation prisons. 
  Moreover, thousands of deportees are still away from their 
homeland. The question being asked by every Palestinian citizen 
is: How can we believe Israel is serious about reaching a 
settlement based on Resolution 242 when the first item of this 
resolution stipulates Israel's withdrawal from all the 
1967-occupied territories, including Jerusalem? 
  The isolation of the Palestinian negotiator from his people 
will weaken him and weaken the front of negotiations if we 
regard it as a new struggle and and a new front to end the 
Israeli occupation. 
  The recent massacres have put the Oslo and Cairo agreements 
to the test and shown the serious gaps in these accords, 
particularly with regard to the question of settlements, which 
is postponed until the final status negotiations. 
  The criminal acts practiced by settlers and the measures 
taken by the Israeli Government to curb them are trivial and can 
deceive nobody. I would like to ask: What will be the state of 
Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho if one of the settlers 
in Gaza, Jericho, or Hebron -- who is fully protected in 
accordance with the Cairo accord -- commits a new crime? If we 
are talking about a real withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, all 
settlers must withdraw from these two areas. Regrettably, the 
Cairo accord, which was signed by President 'Arafat alone, 
thereby violating the Executive Committee's decision, has turned 
the withdrawal from Gaza, stipulated by the Oslo Declaration, 
into a redeployment of forces because it has given the Israeli 
settlements -- under the pretext of maintaining their security 
-- an area which is three times the actual areas of these 
settlements. The Cairo accord also gave the Israeli Army the 
right to control and move patrols on three roads in Gaza, which 
have fragmented the strip into separate parts. The Israeli side 
refuses to expand the Jericho area to more than 50 km under the 
pretext that there should be no Israeli settlements in the area. 
  This situation simply calls for going back on what was 
agreed 
upon in Cairo and Oslo in this regard and for insisting on the 
withdrawal of the settlements together with the Israeli forces 
in these areas so that there will be no excuse to maintain the 
Israeli Army in these positions. 
  Furthermore, the recent massacre and subsequent acts have 
canceled any sense of security among the Palestinians, 
particularly if the settlers, such as the gangs of settlers in 
Hebron, are close to them. This requires the immediate 
evacuation of these settlers-- a matter adopted by one-half of 
the Israeli Cabinet. 
  The crime also exposed the serious mistake represented by 
delaying the discussion of settlements to the final stage. This 
mistake must be rectified before there can be any talk about 
resuming the negotiations. We have paid a heavy price for the 
Palestinian side's acceptance of the Israeli concept of peace 
and the Israeli interpretation of the Declaration of Principles, 
as was very evident in the Cairo accord. 
  ['Abid] Following the massacre, we have seen a split in the 
Palestinian arena. Some people call for withdrawal from the 
talks and others call for suspending these talks. Where do you 
stand in this regard? 
  [Al-Najjab] First, we do not call for withdrawal from the 
talks. The overwhelming majority of our people support the 
talks that will lead to a political settlement on the basis of 
Resolution 242. Suspending the talks is something else. That 
takes place in any talks. And the suspension in itself is a 
negotiating stand that shows that the party that adopts such a 
stand adheres to its stand, seeks through pooling other 
national, sisterly, and international forces to influence the 
other party, and mobilizes world public opinion, including 
Israeli public opinion, to stand against stands that are 
undermining the peace process. 
  We must always remember that the Rabin government is held 
responsible for obstructing the talks and eroding its 
credibility in the Palestinian and Israeli streets. Putting the 
issue of settlements on the top of the agenda receives unanimous 
Palestinian and large-scale support. Therefore, we should 
exploit this. 
  The large-scale criticism of the performance of the 
Palestinian leadership with regard to exploiting this is correct 
and legitimate. The hesitation and confusion in announcing the 
suspension of talks -- even following the suspensions of these 
talks by Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon in solidarity with our 
people -- have weakened the credibility and seriousness of this 
leadership in responding to a general national stand. 
  President 'Arafat was quick to accept U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's invitation to move the negotiations to Washington, 
without referring to the Executive Committee. By this he 
contributed to giving the U.S. Administration credibility that 
it does not deserve. He also gave the illusion that the reason 
for what is happening is the geographic location of the 
negotiations, which is not close to the White House in 
Washington. 
  We saw how the United States used this acceptance at the 
Security Council and we now see the current U.S. attempts to 
prevent the council from adopting a resolution that meets the 
requirements demonstrated by the recent massacre. 
  I would like to say here that the U.S. side is trying to 
force us to pay the price for a formal condemnation of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre by excluding Jerusalem from the 
occupied territories in the draft resolution. 
  Regrettably, some Palestinians have the illusion, the same 
ones as the U.S. side, that delaying the negotiations for a few 
days will calm the situation and that the negotiations could 
then be resumed as if nothing happened. 
  This idea is an illusion because the bullets fired at the 
faithful worshipers kneeling before God were at the same time 
fired at the policy followed in the negotiations. The facts 
raised by this crime are solid and cannot be overcome with the 
passage of time. 
  As for the argument that says it is impossible to review the 
agreements, this conclusion is totally wrong because the 
agreements are not an objective in themselves. They are a means 
to implement Resolution 242 and all its articles, to secure the 
Israeli withdrawal from our occupied land, to guarantee our 
right to self-determination, and to attain peace and security 
for all parties in the region. 
  These agreement proved that they are incapable of securing 
all these demands, therefore, they should be revised in a manner 
that serve their purpose. We should consider the meaning of 
Rabin's insistence on these agreements, and on the Cairo 
agreement in particular, in refusing to reconsider the subject 
of settlements and the timing of discussing this subject. 
  Backing off from unjust and dangerous agreements will not 
undermine the credibility of the Palestinian leadership, but not 
considering the dangers contained in these agreements and the 
possibility that they may lead to more Israeli massacres and 
entrenchment of occupation will. 
  ['Abid] Some people hold 'Arafat responsible for the 
massacre, and say that the massacre was the result of the 
agreements he signed with the Israelis, especially the Cairo 
agreement. Do you share this view? 
  [Al-Najjab] I do not believe that a Palestinian or an Arab 
could say such a thing. How can the victim be responsible for 
the crime? I can say that the Israeli Government--not 'Arafat 
as some went too far in saying--is responsible for the crime. 
We should not make mistakes about this and we should continue 
to work to let the criminal pay for his crime. The one who 
occupies our land is the Israeli Army, and it is the Israeli 
Government that builds settlements, arms settlers, and remains 
silent toward their recklessness and crimes. In this, the 
Israeli labor and Likud governments are equals. 
  ['Abid] Some Palestinians have urged 'Arafat to resign, 
saying he does not represent the Palestinian people any more. 
Do you share this opinion? 
  [Al-Najjab] First of all, and in this particular situation, 
fights and demands should be focused on the perpetrators of the 
crime. We should distinguish between the measures that should 
be taken to force the perpetrators of the crime to pay for what 
they did, and the internal Palestinian demands, or what we call 
reorganizing the Palestinian house in a manner that develops the 
performance of the leadership and the Palestinian establishments 
and restores people's confidence in the PLO. 
  What should be toppled is the current policy, which has been 
proven untenable by all the challenges and tasks of the new 
stage of our national struggle. There are very strong and wide 
criticism of President 'Arafat's policy. It is up to him now, 
and he has to decide whether to continue this policy, thus 
leading to more isolation, or to rise to a new situation. 
  If this is how I see things, this is because we are talking 
about an issue of concern to the entire Palestinian community. 
We are talking about the protection of Palestinian rights and 
gains. All the national forces, figures, and institutions must 
join hands to secure international protection for the 
Palestinian people and to tackle serious problems caused by 
Israel's arrogance and the open U.S. support it enjoys, as well 
as the sorry state of Arab solidarity and coordination. 
Additionally, the performance of the Palestinian leadership 
leaves much to be desired and the legitimate Palestinian 
institutions, including the PLO's Executive Committee, have been 
in a state of inertia. Nor has there been a commitment to the 
PLO's plan of action or the peace initiative. 
  ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to be very much in control of the 
Executive Committee. Why is it that some members are boycotting 
its sessions most of the time? 
  [Al-Najjab] I would first like to draw a line between two 
groups within the PLO, although they have much in common. There 
is the group of six who tendered their resignation from the 
Executive Committee. Their resignations, however, are not 
valid, since it is up to the Palestine National Council to 
accept or reject them. Another group is supportive of the 
negotiations. 
  As for me, I made my boycott of the Executive Committee's 
sessions known twice. The first time was when 'Arafat 
unilaterally signed the Cairo agreement, thus presenting the 
committee with an fait accompli. I and others did not show up 
for that session and, therefore, it lacked a quorum. The second 
was when 'Arafat unilaterally accepted President Clinton's 
invitation for the talks to continue in Washington. 'Arafat 
thus turned a deaf ear to the voice of local and dispora 
Palestinians, all of whom want the negotiations to be suspended 
until international protection is secured. Hence, the call for 
an Executive Committee meeting so that 'Arafat may explain a 
decision he made on his own. 
  Only seven members turned up for that session. Five members 
did not attend in order to deprive the session of a quorum. 
  It is not too late yet for the Executive Committee to 
reconvene, according to rules. To facilitate this, 'Arafat 
should break off the negotiations and go along with the 
Palestinian consensus. That would open the door for a serious 
assessment of the negotiating process and, having drawn the 
necessary lessons, put it back on track. Such a development 
would also arrest the deterioration in the Palestinian position 
as happened when the Palestine Central Council endorsed the Oslo 
accord by a majority, if with certain qualifications. 
  We have asked the brothers who resigned from the Executive 
Committee to attend at least one session at which it may be 
possible to take a vote on and abrogate the Cairo accord. 
  ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to have files on each and every 
member of the Executive Committee so that he can win over 
whoever he needs to whenever he wants to. Is this true? 
  [Al-Najjab] I have been asked this question often enough by 
journalists. Regrettably, the cake has been carved up so as to 
reflect the closeness of this or that PLO member to 'Arafat. 
  As an old political party [reference to the Palestinian 
People's Party], whose participation in the Executive Committee 
is fairly recent, we can claim to have nothing to do with such 
tactics. How close we are to 'Arafat or other PLO Executive 
Committee members depends on how much or little we have in 
common. 
  We support serious and persistent efforts to defend our 
people's rights and promote coordination and cooperation with 
fraternal countries. We participate in a serious mechanism to 
achieve all this. As is known, we participated in the 
Washington talks, but we suspended our participation in the 
ninth session for well-known political reasons in protest 
against the course of the negotiations and the performance that 
unfortunately still prevails. 
  ['Abid] But one of your party central committee members 
still 
participates in the Taba negotiations? 
  [Al-Najjab] Hasan 'Asfur was elected as the People's Party 
Central Committee member at the second party congress. As was 
announced at the time in the statement and by 'Asfur himself, 
his participation in the negotiations was a personal decision 
and he represents no one. It is known that his case was 
referred to a party commission to have him account for not 
abiding by his party's decision not to participate in the Taba 
negotiations. 
  The fate of 'Asfur, whether he remains a Central Committee 
member or not, will be decided by the party congress. We are 
making arrangements to hold this congress. We are a democratic 
party, and will respect the decisions of the congress, which is 
the highest authority in the party. As yet, the violations 
Hasan 'Asfur has committed are organizational and not political 
violations. 
  ['Abid] Many voices are being raised calling for revenge 
against the Israelis following the Hebron Mosque massacre. What 
do you have to say to this? 
  [Al-Najjab] If we want to really avenge all the victims of 
the Palestinian people, we must pursue work to seek salvation 
from the occupation and to wrest our people's national rights. 
I do not support any personal reaction and I am against 
attacking Israeli civilians. Our cause is just and the weapon 
we use should remain clean. It is impermissible to give the 
Israelis any justification to cover up for their crimes or to 
give those who defend them in Washington the excuse to speak 
about terrorism without specifying the party they mean. 
  We must take into consideration the need not to lose the 
Israeli voices that condemn the settlers massacres and call for 
their removal by not carrying out individual operations against 
civilians. 
  ['Abid] What is required on the Palestinian level at the 
present stage? How can one develop some of the stands that were 
shaken by the Hebron Mosque massacre? 
  [Al-Najjab] Our battle is a protracted one. What is 
important now is to enhance our national unity, as well as Arab 
coordination and cooperation, particularly with Jordan, Syria, 
and Lebanon. We wish success to the efforts under way to 
restore coordination among the parties participating in the 
negotiations, especially since all the parties abide by the 
comprehensive solution, which means the implementation of all 
the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 242 on all the 
tracks. 
  We must also pursue work with all of the international 
parties angered by the recent crime to have them continue and 
develop their support for our people and rights, taking into 
consideration that these parties are getting more and more 
convinced that peace cannot be achieved at the expense of these 
rights, or by ignoring them.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat will arrive in Cairo 6 March. He and President Husni 
Mubarak will hold urgent consultations and comprehensively 
evaluate the peace process and the developments in the wake of 
the Hebron massacre. 
  This was stated by Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id 
Kamal, who told MENA in an exclusive statement that late last 
night he conveyed to Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa a message from 
President 'Arafat on some obstacles the Israelis and Americans 
are still raising to a UN Security Council resolution condemning 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and approving the deployment of 
international observers in the West Bank and Gaza. 
  The Palestinian ambassador said the United States rejects 
any 
mention of Arab Jerusalem in any Security Council resolution on 
the pretext that Jerusalem will be discussed in the final stage 
of the negotiations. 
  Kamal noted that this problem can be overcome by calling for 
dismantling the settlements and protecting the Palestinians in 
all the territories occupied in 1967, which implicitly means 
Arab Jerusalem. 
  He said 'Arafat's message to the Egyptian leadership is part 
of the constant, ongoing coordination and consultations between 
Egypt and the PLO, especially within the framework of Egypt's 
current efforts to issue a Security Council resolution 
condemning the Hebron massacre. 
  The Palestinian ambassador to Egypt said while in Cairo 
'Arafat will also receive a report from Dr. Nabil Sha'th on his 
talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and a number of his advisers, especially Dennis 
Ross, the general coordinator of the Middle East peace talks. 
  Kamal called on the United States to adopt an effective 
position on forcing Israel to disarm the settlers, not only in 
Gaza and Jericho, but also throughout the West Bank, too. 
  He explained that the issue of an international presence or 
forces in Gaza and Jericho is not new, as it was mentioned in 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached in 
Oslo and signed in Washington on 13 September. Full details of 
that declaration had been worked out by Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators before the al-Ibrahimi massacre, he said. 
  He stressed that the Palestinians now want the settlers to 
be 
disarmed effectively and expeditiously. 
  Kamal called on the United States to take effective measures 
to recognize the PLO, as it promised to do during a meeting in 
Washington in October between PLO Political Department Chief 
Faruq Qaddumi and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

  [Text] Occupied Jerusalem--Quds Press--The Palestinian 
Hamas Movement inside the occupied territories has called for 
challenging the Israeli authorities' decision and go tomorrow, 
Friday, [as published] to the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
tomorrow, Friday, to perform their prayers. 
  The movement distributed a statement at the start of a new 
month for the Palestinian intifadah. The statement says: We 
call on our kinsfolk and beloved ones in Hebron to challenge the 
occupation authorities and perform Friday prayers at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque on 4 March, stage a mammoth march after prayers, 
and throw stones and Molotov cocktails at the occupation 
authorities' cars, because the Israeli occupation forces have 
announced the closure of the Ibrahimi Mosque following the 
massacre and said they will prevent the worshipers from entering 
the mosque until new security arrangements are taken. 
  In its statement Hamas said: This statement is a warning to 
the people. The statement starts with the Koranic verse: "And 
they ill-treated them for no other reason than that they 
believed in God, exalted in power, worthy of all praise." SAWT 
AL-SHA'B publishes the text of the statement: 
  O brave men of Hebron. O the lions of Gaza. O the heroes of 
Nabulus. O the guardians of al-Aqsa Mosque. O the knights of 
Ramallah and Bethlehem. O the enduring masses in all our towns, 
villages and camps. O the men, women, youth, and children. 
Declare it a fresh revolution against the occupation. Cry out 
Allah Akbar [God is great] and let these cries tear out the 
hearts of the criminal Zionist occupiers. Let the hearts of the 
malicious settlers tremble. Pursue the occupation soldiers and 
attack the gangs of settlers and slay them wherever you catch 
them for things have come to a head and all the deception has 
been uncovered. The massacre is evidence as clear as the sun 
that our Zionist enemy does not respect ties of kinship or 
covenant. It wants to multiply our wounds so we will surrender 
and so it will keep anyone it wants and evict anyone it wants. 
It is doing so under the umbrella of peace, the love of peace, 
and the headlines of the Oslo and Cairo agreements. 
  The collaboration of the government of terrorist Rabin with 
the malicious criminal settlers in this barbaric massacre, after 
the signing of the treasonous Cairo agreement is a definite 
indication that all Zionists are the same and that they all 
harbor hatred against our Muslim people, civilization, and 
nation. 
  Let the veil drop from the eyes of those who have illusions 
about peace with the enemy. Let the symbols of capitulation -- 
those of Madrid, Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, who are crouching 
in Tunis watching the wounds of our people and nation -- fall. 
  O masses of our garrisoned people. Let the abhorrent 
barbaric massacre be the start of a new stage in our people's 
struggle and for the escalation of our national revolution 
against the wicked occupation, including all its tools and 
symbols. 
  Let the land burn under the feet of the occupiers. Let the 
cries of Allah Akbar be raised. Let the confrontations of our 
masses with the pillars of occupation continue. Let us foil the 
policy of capitulation and let the blood of our martyrs and 
injured ones and the sufferings of our men and women turn into a 
curse that pursues the occupiers day and night so our national 
rank will be pure and united on the road of struggle toward 
victory and liberation. 
  Masses of our glorious people: The vicious Zionist 
massacre is a test to our dignity, pride, and vengeance. It may 
be followed by various other massacres. By God, it is our 
destiny to be standing on the frontline in our nation's conflict 
against the criminal Zionists; and, by God, it is inevitable 
that God will grant us victory over our enemies as long as we 
embrace the means to achieve victory and rely on God almighty, 
conqueror of tyrants and infidels. 
  It was due from us to aid those who believed. 
  God will certainly aid those who aid his cause; for verily 
God is full of strength, exalted in might, and able to enforce 
his will. [Koranic verses] 
  Be united and do not allow any traitor or people with weak 
spirits to join your ranks. Censure the capitulationists and 
defeatists, force them to abide by your hopes and aspirations, 
and block the road between them and the enemy. Let the 
demonstrations and mass rallies take to the streets. Engage 
with the soldiers and the herds of settlers. Let the heroes 
pursue the settlers and turn their settlements into jails and 
let them shed the blood of the rancorous Zionists in the streets 
of the settlements. 
  We, in Hamas, call for the following: 
  1. Friday 4 March: We urge our kinsfolk and beloved ones in 
Hebron to defy the occupation authorities and to perform the 
Friday prayer in the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque. We also urge them to 
go out in a massive rally after the prayer to deafen the enemy 
with the cries of Allahu Akbar and throw stones and Molotov 
cocktails on their cars. 
  2. Friday 4 March: We call on our people to go out in 
massive rallies after the Friday prayer from all mosques in 
Palestine to cry Allahu Akbar, denounce the ugly crime, and call 
on the PLO and the Arab states to withdraw from the negotiations. 
  3. From 5 to 7 March, three days for escalating the 
confrontations and the qualitative operations against the 
occupation soldiers and the herds of settlers. 
  4. Celebrating the al-Qadr Night on 27 Ramadan [9 March] in 
mosques, and to pray to God to grant us victory and defeat the 
occupiers. We also call for crying Allah Akbar in loudspeakers 
from the rooftops of buildings. 
  5. Observing a day of general strike on 9 March on the 
start of the intifadah's 76th month to denounce the signing of 
the treacherous Cairo security agreement. 
  6. On 11 March, the last Friday in Ramadan, we urge all our 
people to travel to holy Jerusalem to perform the Friday prayer 
at the al-Aqsa Mosque. We urge them to defy the occupation 
authorities and the siege and curfew, and to perform the prayer, 
even on the walls of the al-Aqsa Mosque if necessary. 
  7. On 'Id al-Fitr day, we urge the people to perform the 'Id 
prayer outside mosques in open yards, in accordance with the 
Prophet's teachings. We also urge them to visit the families of 
the martyrs, wounded, and detainees and the patients, and to 
help the poor and the needy. 
  8. On 14 March, we call for staging mass rallies, to be 
attended in particular by the families of the martyrs, wounded, 
and detainees. We also urge the demonstrations to proceed to 
the homes of the members of the negotiating team to urge them to 
withdraw completely from the negotiations and to join the 
resistance against occupation. 
  Allah Akbar. Victory to our mujahid people.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, on Friday 
[4 March] described as hollow a call by Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat to join hands in his campaign to negotiate the status of 
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories with Israel and 
ensure the protection of the Palestinians living there. 
  "'Arafat's call is simple theatrics with no substance," said 
Ibrahim Ghawshah, the Amman-based spokesman for Hamas. "He is 
trying to cicumvent Hamas' demand for shelving the so-called 
peace talks with Israel," Mr. Ghawshah told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Mr. Ghawshah was referring to a Feb. 28 letter from Mr. 
'Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
(PLO), to Musa Abu Marzuk, head of the political department of 
Hamas. 
  The PLO leader's letter, which came in response to a Hamas 
message calling on him to abandon the peace talks in the wake of 
the Feb. 25 Massacre of Muslim worshippers by one or more Jewish 
settlers at a Hebron mosque, "did not touch the essence of 
Hamas' position," Mr. Ghawshah said. 
  Furthermore, by sending an envoy to Washington in response 
to 
a call by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Arabs and Israelis to 
resume the peace talks, Mr. 'Arafat "has reaffirmed that he has 
no intention of moving from the course of surrender he has 
adopted," Mr. Ghawshah said. 
  In a Feb. 28 open appeal to the rank of file of Fatah, the 
mainstream PLO group founded by Mr. 'Arafat, Hamas said: "We 
appeal to our brothers in Fatah to join hands and escalate the 
Intifadah and holy war against the enemy." 
  "The (Hebron massacre) in which hundreds of our people died 
confirms the righteousness of resistance and armed struggle, and 
exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to coexist in peace 
with our people," it said. 
  In his message to Hamas, Mr. 'Arafat said: "It is the hour 
of unity and solidarity and uniting ranks and not differences 
and divisions." 
  "This unity is most needed when we are fighting one of our 
fiercest battles to find a radical and comprehensive solution to 
the settlements and the disarming of settlers and securing 
international protection for our people," he wrote. 
  According to Mr. Ghawshah, "this is not a language of 
reconciliation as we had proposed. We wanted 'Arafat to abandon 
the negotiations with Israel and return to armed struggle to 
liberate our lands." 
  Mr. Ghawshah said Mr. 'Arafat "is ignoring the streets of 
Amman, Damascus, Cairo and the occupied territories which have 
erupted in protest against negotiations with Israel." 
  "Arafat no longer represents the Palestinian people," he 
added. 
  Hamas, which is locked in a running battle with Mr. 
'Arafat's 
Fatah for leadership of the Palestinians living in the occupied 
territories, rules out any dealings with Israel and propagates 
jihad (holy war) as the means to achieve liberation. 
  The group has vowed to step up armed attacks atgainst 
Israelis and, in a Feb. 25 statement, singled out settlers as 
potential targets for revenge attacks following the Hebron 
massacre. 
  "We will not let up our resistance against Israel until the 
lands are totally liberated," Mr. Ghawshah vowed Friday. 
  He said a group of 10 Palestinian groups in an alliance 
based 
in Damascus would meet after 'id al-Fitr "to concentrate on our 
further course of action" to undermine the peace process. 
  The coalition, known as the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, 
"was preoccupied with internal affairs so far," Mr. Ghawshah 
said. "Now we can turn our full attention to activities in the 
occupied territories." 
  He was referring to the formation of a leadership council 
for 
the allaince. After several months of deliberations, the 
council was formed in January, with each of the 10 factions 
nominating two members each to the body. All secretary generals 
of the groups plus members are now members of the council. The 
only exception is the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PFLP), whose secretary-general, George Habash, did 
not join the council because of ill-health and nominated his 
deputy. 
  For the first time after the Sept. 13 Israeli-PLO accord was 
signed, Hamas has threatened Palestinians from the occupied 
territories who are members of the delegation negotiating peace 
with Israel. 
  "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate 
withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel," the group said in 
an open letter addressed to the Palestinians living in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The reference to Oslo was to 
the site where Isaeli and PLO negotitors worked out in secret 
the autonomy accord which was formally signed in Washington in 
September. 
  "We will not allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to 
continue 
negotiations with those murderers at the expenses of the 
Palestinian people."

<F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Islamic Hamas Movement </F>
spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah by correspondent Muhammad Tishkar in 
Beirut; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] In the name of God, the merciful and the 
compassionate. The Palestinian Islamic Hamas Movement has 
announced that it rejects the dispatch of UN forces to the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip in order to protect the Palestinians. 
Hamas Movement spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said in a telephone 
interview that this plan is designed to circumvent the basic 
problem, which is the presence of the Zionist occupation and the 
Zionist settlers on Palestinian territory. He affirmed that the 
PLO's purpose in making this suggestion is to attempt to tone 
down the escalating opposition among the Palestinian people 
inside and outside Palestine to enable the organization to 
resume its negotiations with the Zionist occupation. Ghawshah 
noted that the dispatch of UN observers will not ensure 
protection for the Palestinian people. Even if the UN Security 
Council decides to send armed forces to protect the 
Palestinians, he said, these forces will not be able to provide 
such protection. Proof of this is that thousands of UN armed 
forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina could not prevent massacres there.

  [Text] Editor-in-chief of AKHIR KHABAR: 
  Peace be upon you. Your newspaper published a front-page 
report on 5 March headlined "Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] Orders 
Not To Retaliate" which says that sources close to the Hamas 
Movement told you that the Palestinian leadership hopes Hamas 
will not carry out any military operations at present, and that 
Hamas has halfheartedly responded to this request. 
  We emphasize that this report is baseless and that all 
information contained in this report is a total fabrication. 
  No contacts have taken place between our movement and the 
Palestinian leadership on retaliation for the Hebron massacre. 
Our movement's policy is clear and open. It calls for strong 
and decisive retaliation against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre and revenge for the martyrs' blood. 
  Our position has always rejected the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements, and this fully conflicts with the published report. 
  While we wish that you would check such information through 
contacting the known Hamas representatives in the future, we 
hope that you will publish this clarification in the same place 
in which that report was published. [no signature as published]

  [Text] Damascus, 5 Mar (SANA)--The Unified National 
Leadership of the Intifadah [UNLI] has stressed that it will 
escalate the struggle with all its resources and energies. It 
also stressed it will entrench all forms of struggle against the 
Zionist machine of suppression and the Zionist settlers and 
emphasized need for withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  In a statement entitled "The Vengeance Call" distributed 
here 
today, UNLI said the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque crime, which was 
committed by the Israeli occupation authorities, reveal the ugly 
criminal face of these authorities and the true Israeli 
objectives; namely to murder our people, to empty our land of 
its inhabitants, and to settle the Zionist settlers in their 
place. The crime also reveals the falsity of the Zionist 
allegations, which keep talking about peace. 
  In its call, UNLI demands the United Nations, particularly 
the UN Security Council, to shoulder its responsibility to 
protect our unarmed people and provide real protection for them 
so the world organization can prove its credibility. 
  UNLI urges the international and regional organizations and 
the European peoples who support human rights to work on 
fulfilling their role toward our unarmed people and their right 
to live in freedom, dignity, and security on their land. 
  It also urges our people in the diaspora camps to continue 
the solidarity activities in the face of the Zionist killers. 
It also hails the decision made by Fatah Hawks [group in the 
occupied territories] and Fatah militants to resume armed action 
and struggle against the occupation troops and end the so-called 
truce. 
  UNLI also calls for a plan to activate the work of the 
militant coordination committees in the field, which should 
group all militant forces and figures in the homeland, and to 
continue and escalate all forms of struggle throughout the 
entire homeland.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5, IRNA--Palestine Islamic jihad 
movement's secretary-general, Fathi Shaqaqi said here Saturday 
[6 March] that the Zionists will see a chain of vengeful 
operations soon in retaliation for the last Friday's massacre of 
Muslim worshippers at Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil. 
  Speaking to IRNA, he said the bloodbath in al-Khalil 
[Hebron] 
was a pre-designed plot carried out by the Qods occupier forces. 
  Shaqaqi said the Zionists were dissatisfied with the active 
presence of Palestinian Muslims at Prophet Ibrahim's (peace be 
upon him) mosque. They committed the horrible crime to 
strengthen their own presence in al-Khalil which houses 27 
Jewish settlements, he said. 
  He brushed aside the Zionist claim that the crime may have 
been carried by an individual and said the people who were 
present at the scene said that some militarymen opened fire on 
the crowd in the mosque. 
  Elsewhere on reflection of the crime and its impact on the 
world, Shaqaqi said the shameful crime made Russia call, for the 
first time in the recent year, for international support for the 
Palestinian people living in the occupied lands.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
stated that President Husni Mubarak and Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat discussed the situation in the occupied Arab 
territories and the impact of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque's incident 
on the peace process. 
  In a statement following the conclusion of the 
Mubarak-'Arafat talks this evening, Musa said the two presidents 
also discussed the issues of settlements and Palestinian 
security in the occupied territories. 
  Musa said the security issue concerns not only the Israelis 
but both the Arabs and Israelis. Therefore, from now on we 
cannot speak about Israeli security without talking about 
Palestinian security on an equal footing. 
  Musa explained that the demonstrations that were staged in 
Jerusalem today to protest the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident 
supported peace. They definitely encourage and give the 
impression that forces desiring peace from the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides can play a role in encouraging an agreement. 
  Musa said: We have never said that all Israelis are 
settlers. But we have spoken about these extremist and 
aggressive gunmen who commit crimes against the Palestinians in 
the occupied territories. This is why we have spoken about 
disarming the outlaw elements in some organizations. 
  Asked if the Palestinians insist that the UN Security 
Council 
issue a resolution providing protection for the Palestinian 
people, Musa said the Security Council resolution should refer 
to the security and protection of the Palestinians. Moreover, 
the Israeli Government is dutybound to take measures to protect 
the Palestinians from the settlers' attacks and the terrorist 
organizations inside the settlements. 
  On whether Israel is prepared to accept the presence of 
international observers in the occupied territories, Musa said 
there is a basis for this in the Declaration of Principles, in 
which Israel accepted a foreign presence between them and the 
Palestinians. This indicates that this idea is not ruled out. 
However, what is being discussed now at the Security Council is 
the protection of the Palestinians in the rest of the occupied 
territories, that is in the West Bank as well. 
  Musa added that we are speaking about a framework during the 
next two weeks envisaging the disarming of the settlements, 
protecting the Palestinians, and disbanding the terrorist 
organizations. There must be decisive Israeli measures because, 
under international law, Israel is responsible for the 
territories under its military occupation. 
  Asked about the statements by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher following his meeting with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and 
whether these statements indicate a U.S. conviction for the need 
to provide protection for the Palestinians, Musa expressed his 
appreciation of the stands of the United States and Europe and 
of their awareness of these considerations. He stressed that 
there is a worldwide understanding of this issue. 
  On the date of the resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian 
talks, Musa said setting a date is not being discussed now 
although the negotiating track still exists. 
  Asked if the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident will make it 
difficult to convince the Arab people to continue the peace 
process, Musa said that the crime that was committed in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque provoked Arab people everywhere, including 
the Egyptian people and Government. We are all together in this 
and are angry over what happened.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, arrived in Cairo 
tonight after a tour of the United States, Britain, and Norway. 
  Upon his arrival, Sha'th said he will brief President 
'Arafat 
on the outcome of his tour, which focused on how to respond to 
the Palestinian people's need for security following the 
criminal al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. He expressed 
the belief that the most important outcome of his tour was the 
agreement of the U.S., British, and Norwegian Governments that 
providing security for the Palestinians is a top priority before 
the peace process can be resumed. The three governments also 
believe that the Palestinian demand is just and must be met. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
expressed his country's full consent to the presence of UN 
forces in the occupied territories and British participation in 
them. The Norwegian foreign minister explained that his country 
has issued orders to the Norwegian Armed Forces and Norwegian 
planes are ready to take off immediately once a resolution is 
issued in this respect. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the Americans have declared their agreement 
in principle but want time to study the measures and discuss the 
subject with Israel. 
  Dr. Sha'th explained that in principle the three parties 
agree on the need to restrain the terrorist settlers and prevent 
the Israelis from carrying weapons in Palestinian towns and 
villages. They also agree on other measures to reduce the 
violence by the Israeli army, which after the massacre killed 
people in numbers nearly equal to those in the massacre. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that the three parties affirmed the need to 
return to the talks quickly so that the Israeli withdrawal can 
take place before 13 April. 
  Dr. Sha'th stressed that Egypt will remain a full partner in 
the talks, whether they are held in Cairo or Washington. He 
noted that it is especially significant that he started his tour 
in Egypt and returned at the end.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat held a press conference at 
the conclusion of their two-hour talks last evening. 
  'Arafat opened the conference by saying: I extend my 
heartfelt thanks to President Husni Mubarak, who is standing 
firmly and strongly with the Palestinian people, their cause, 
and their sanctities. 
  'Arafat expressed his appreciation of the firm stance Egypt 
has taken with the Palestinian people vis-a-vis the heinous 
massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. I have asked President 
Mubarak to make efforts with all the parties concerned in the UN 
Security Council to follow up on this matter, he said, adding: 
I discussed this matter with Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  On resuming the peace negotiations, 'Arafat said: We cannot 
talk about negotiations until we see what the situation will be 
like at the Security Council and until we see the resolution it 
will adopt. We insist on full condemnation of this heinous 
crime, international protection for our people, and disarming 
settlement inhabitants, he stressed. 
  'Arafat emphasized the need for protecting the Palestinian 
people, emphasizing that withdrawing settlers from Hebron is 
essential because these settlements are dangerous. He added 
that the Israeli Government must take effective and swift 
measures to control the settlers, because this is its 
responsibility. 
  Answering a question on the outcome of the talks his 
adviser, 
Dr. Nabil Sha'th, held in the United States, 'Arafat said: We 
hope the United States will take a clear-cut stance to urge the 
Security Council to issue a resolution--this is very important 
for the occupied territories, particularly Jerusalem--to disarm 
settlers and provide international protection for the 
Palestinians. 
  'Arafat added that the most important thing is to determine 
the party that will take charge of protecting Palestinians, 
because we have an army [as received] to protect the 
Palestinians from these settlers. 
  'Arafat affirmed that units of the Israeli Army were 
involved 
in the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa remarked that the situation is 
too 
serious to be addressed in a sentimental manner. The matter 
needs specific measures, he emphasized. 
  The foreign minister underlined the need for the UN Security 
Council to issue a resolution and enforce certain measures to 
protect the Palestinians against aggression by the Israeli 
settlers. 
  Speaking about the minimum Palestinian demands, Musa said 
that President 'Arafat has already stated this clearly: a UN 
Security Council resolution and certain measures to guarantee 
protection for the Palestinians and their safety. The 
settlements cannot be left the way they are now because this 
will lead to a repetition of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque incident, 
Musa said, hoping the Security Council will adopt a resolution 
as soon as possible. 
  The UN Security Council resolution must involve the minimum 
Palestinian demands that are supported by the Arab states and 
the international community, he stressed. We are very upset at 
the delay in issuing a resolution because the Hebron incident 
cannot pass without taking specific measures to avert a 
recurrence and in the meantime protect the Palestinians in 
accordance with the international resolutions that should be 
respected, he emphasized. 
  The foreign minister reiterated that all are acting to issue 
a resolution and enforce certain measures to protect the 
Palestinians. We have expressed our regrets and our denunciation 
of what happened in Hebron, he said, adding that the issue of 
Palestinian protection and settlers must be taken into 
consideration. 
  Musa pointed out that as an occupying force, Israel is fully 
responsible for protecting the Palestinians according to the 4th 
Geneva agreement. He said that the West Bank and Gaza are under 
Israeli occupation, according to UN Security Council Resolution 
242.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with President Husni Mubarak by an </F>
unidentified AL-QABAS reporter on 7 March; place not 
given--opening paragraphs are MENA introduction] 
  [Text] Kuwait, 6 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
stressd the importance of finding a way to guarantee the 
security of Palestinians in the occupied territories. He 
expressed his deep regret and sadness over the Hebron Mosque 
massacre of Palestinians at prayer. He stressed the importance 
of continuing the peace process and denying extremists the 
opportunity to destroy the negotiations. In a comprehensive 
interview with Kuwait's AL-QABAS' Monday edition, President 
Mubarak said that Egypt has consistently supported the 
Palestinians, noting that it backs the Palestinian request to 
disarm the settlers. 
  President Mubarak pointed out that Egypt's view of the 
area's 
future in light of the plans being proposed, such as the "Middle 
Eastern Market," is that there is a need for cooperation among 
all the countries of the region. He said that if there is 
cooperation among the region's countries, it would benefit all 
of them; it is unreasonable that one party should benefit from 
such a market. He noted that the world currently is being run 
by mutual interests and not by emotion and that peoples 
currently look for what secures a means of living. He said that 
Arabs need to trust their potential and that they are capable of 
enhancing cooperation with any party through coordination among 
themselves in their common interest. 
  Discussing the negotiations on the Syrian track, President 
Mubarak said that Egypt is always prepared to cooperate with all 
parties to facilitate the negotiating process, noting that the 
Syrian brothers have the capability and potential to negotiate. 
  Regarding the Damascus Declaration, President Mubarak said 
that Egypt's relations with the Gulf countries are excellent 
with or without the declaration. He said that Egypt will stand 
by the Gulf countries if they need help whether the declaration 
exists or not. 
  On relations with Iran, President Mubarak pointed out that 
Egypt is prepared to establish good relations with all countries 
of the world if they are based on good intentions and respect 
for the principle of nonintervention in the domestic affairs of 
others. He reviewed Egypt's efforts before and after the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait and its impact on Arab relations. He said 
that Egypt always calls for respecting international legitimacy. 
  Discussing the domestic situation in Egypt, President 
Mubarak 
said that he gives priority to the economic reform program, 
noting that a great deal has been achieved. He noted that the 
terrorist groups are trying to stop the economic reform process 
by striking at the country's stability but that they have not 
and will not succeed. He noted that certain information media 
organizations, notably Western ones, are trying to exaggerate 
the incidents that occur in Egypt. He asserted that the 
security agencies in Egypt are strong and capable of uncovering 
and hunting down perpetrators of terrorist acts and referring 
them to courts. He stressed that no one will escape justice. 
He said that the Egyptian people and their institutions are 
capable of traversing this stage and achieving stability. 
  Following is the text of the interview: 
  [AL-QABAS] It seems to me that we must begin with the 
painful 
Palestinian developments. Where are we heading? How do you 
evaluate Arab reactions to the limited Israeli measures after 
the Hebron killings? What effect will moving the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks to Washington have? 
  [Mubarak] I would like to say that the incident was really 
sad, a shock beyond belief. It is true that there are 
extremists all over the world, but I believe Israel can control 
this kind of extremism. What is worse, the incident took place 
in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque during prayers and in the holy month 
of Ramadan. This act, therefore, is unimaginable. But 
extremists can do any thing because they have no principles or 
values. Some say that the killer (Goldstein) could not do it 
individually, and that he had accomplices. I cannot be sure, 
but I hear things here and there. In the final analysis, it is a 
dirty attack that might have been intended to hinder the peace 
process. If we respond by hindering the peace process, both 
sides will lose a great deal. 
  I believe Israel must take strict measures to protect the 
Palestinians. At the same time, I tell the Palestinian people 
that we must carry on with the peace process; we will face many 
obstacles because many groups on both sides do not want the 
peace process to move ahead. 
  [AL-QABAS] Do you believe, Mr. President, that Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat is capable of defending and implementing 
the Cairo Agreement, or is there a need to amend it? If 
amendment is needed, how can it be done? 
  [Mubarak] I believe that there should be no postponement of 
the peace talks. Opportunity comes only once, and it is now 
available. 'Arafat is in a stronger position now and I believe 
that he should not postpone the negotiations, but continue the 
process. Who knows what will happen if he postpones the talks? 
Some Palestinian group may carry out an act of revenge and 
things will move in a vicious circle. Now the Palestinians are 
the victims. If an extremist Palestinian group carries out some 
operation, the position of the Israelis will grow stronger. 
And, because they have a more powerful media and other 
capabilities, we will lose. This is my personal opinion. 
  [AL-QABAS] So, what should Israel do to put things back on 
the right course? 
  [Mubarak] I do not want to go into the details of what 
Israel 
needs to do. I am talking in general. First, strict measures 
must be taken against those who contributed to the attack. 
Second, we must find a way to protect the Palestinians from the 
attacks that may be perpetrated by extremist groups while the 
peace negotiations are in progress. 
  [AL-QABAS] The Egyptian position is clear, Mr. President. 
You are demanding that the Israeli settlers be disarmed. 
  [Mubarak] This is a Palestinian demand, and we support it 
and 
demand other measures. What is important is to secure the 
Palestinians and the peace process. If things are left 
uncontrolled, then attacks and counterattacks will take place 
daily; we will enter a vicious circle and we will not reach a 
solution. Now we have a chance for a peace process, and no one 
knows what will happen later. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, are you still trying to facilitate 
the negotiations on the Syrian track? How far ahead did the 
Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton push things? 
  [Mubarak] Our brothers in Syria have the capability for 
negotiations. When we are asked to facilitate things or bring 
viewpoints closer, we do not hesitate. But we do not impose 
ourselves on anyone: the Syrians, the Palestinians, or any other 
party. Anyone asking for our help tells us exactly what he 
wants and we do not hesitate. But we do not act automatically. 
We discuss the request, assess the possibilities, and then try 
to help through contacts with either Israel or the United States. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, how does Egypt see the region's 
future in light of plans that are being proposed, such as the 
Middle Eastern market? What is your stance on this particular 
plan? 
  [Mubarak] The Middle Eastern market was an idea proposed by 
someone. It does not mean that we should concentrate on it and 
put everything else aside. They have been talking about a 
Middle Eastern market since 1983. I believe that it was Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who proposed it in 1982 or 1983. 
He has some specific ideas, but should we deal with them before 
the peace process? I do not think so. 
  [AL-QABAS] This Middle Eastern market initiative came from 
them. Why is our role as Arabs always limited to receiving 
initiatives? Why don't we came out with initiatives? 
  [Mubarak] Let me tell you that we do not receive 
initiatives. 
Egypt was the first country to take the peace process 
initiative. How then can it be said that Egypt is at the 
receiving end of initiatives? We surprise the world with our 
initiatives. France and Germany were very bitter enemies, but 
when the issue concerns peoples and public interest, then I 
cooperate with anyone whoever he is, even if he is a genie. We 
take the people and economic interests into account. Everyone 
wants what is best for his people. If I believe that I have an 
interest in such type of cooperation, then I will not hesitate. 
Take the countries that had bitter enmity between them and you 
see that there is cooperation between them now. I do not say 
that there are friendly relations between Germany and France but 
mutual economic interests. 
  If I have to cooperate strategically with Israel or anyone 
else, then it is because I have an interest. Of course, they 
too have interests. We, the Arabs, have interests too. The 
world is motivated by mutual interests and not by emotions. 
People are now looking for whatever ensures their livelihood 
and we want to raise our peoples' standards of living. If there 
is cooperation, it means that the benefit has to be mutual. It 
is not reasonable to have one side only benefiting and not the 
other. Let us see, for example, what was said about Egypt when 
it established relations with Israel. It was said that Israel 
would swallow Egypt economically. Has this happened? Almost 13 
years have passed since then, but has Egypt been drowned "as 
some are claiming" by Israeli goods? They are the ones buying 
from us. 
  Why are we, the Arabs, trying to belittle our capabilities? 
We must be confident that we are capable of cooperating with 
any party as long as we are coordinating together, taking care 
of our interests, and operating within the framework of common 
interests. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, there is the problem of relations 
with Iran and Turkey. Do you believe that they can be brought 
together with the Arabs in a regional framework, especially as 
these two countries have common interests, civilizations, and 
history with the Arab world? 
  [Mubarak] The Arab world is bound by many ties based on 
language, culture, and religion. This does not mean that I am 
excluding Turkey or anyone else. We have very good relations 
with Turkey in particular. The Arab countries have good 
relations with Turkey. If you are talking about a regional 
framework, I do not want to talk about alliances now. It is 
still too early to talk about alliances. 
  As for Iran, our relations with it in the past were good. 
I made numerous attempts to cooperate with Iran, but it says 
one thing and does the opposite. The last time Iranian 
officials contacted us, "some time ago," they talked about 
reopening offices and a consulate. I needed some time to think 
before I could agree. They had a charge d'affairs here, who did 
certain things, made contacts, travelled around the country, and 
spent money; despite this, I agreed after long consideration. 
They then said that it was time to exchange ambassadors. I was 
cautious about this for a long time and after approximately a 
year and a half I said that I agreed in principle. They asked 
that we name the ambassador. The next day, I heard about a 
problem in Iran between certain extremists and 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati. They asked him if he was going to open an embassy in 
Egypt. He said no and that he was only opening a cultural 
office. I told them thank you but we do not need a cultural 
office. This shows that they have domestic differences. 
  I am prepared for cooperation with Iran if its intentions 
are 
good and if there is a respect for the principle of 
nonintervention in domestic affairs. For our part, we do not 
interfere in Iran's domestic affairs. Should Iran try to 
interfere in our domestic affairs, we will reject this. It is 
easy for Iranian officials to say that we interfere in Iran's 
domestic affairs, but we do not do that because it is 
inconsistent with our values. 
  If any country imagines that it can play in our country, we 
can do the same because it is not difficult. However, our 
principle is not to interfere in the domestic affairs of others. 
I will not change this principle. If anyone makes a mistake, I 
will warn him but I will not interfere in domestic affairs. 
Recruiting people inside other countries is not difficult and 
the cost is not that high. How much would be spent on 
recruiting? They are mistaken if they believe that we are not 
doing this for economic reasons. This is an erroneous belief 
because all countries have economic problems. All countries are 
suffering from economic problems, but our principle is not 
spending but adherence to values. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, this topic prompts us to ask a 
question about what certain people call the problem of Egypt's 
role in the region, or, rather, they cite as an indication of 
the crisis the fate of the Damascus Declaration. 
  [Mubarak] To begin with, the Egyptian role is not in a 
crisis: Our relations with the Gulf countries are excellent with 
or without the Damascus Declaration. We will support any Gulf 
country that requests help or assistance in any field, including 
the military one. If any Gulf country requests help, is it 
conceivable that Egypt would refuse? We are signatory to "the 
Joint Arab Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement." The 
first part was not implemented but we will not lag in defending 
our Arab brothers. The Damascus Declaration changed nothing. 
  [AL-QABAS] This talk leads us to broach inter-Arab relations 
and Iraq's future. Do you think that Saddam Husayn's regime can 
comply with all UN resolutions? 
  [Mubarak] I had hoped that the Saddam Husayn regime had not 
done what it did in August 1990. I had not imagined that he 
would do what he did, particularly because in the first Arab 
summit that I attended in Rabat, Saddam Husayn spoke in his 
capacity as the guardian of the eastern gate of the Arab nation. 
He assailed Syria for having forces in Lebanon and told the 
Arabs that if Iraq attacks any Arab country, let all Arab armies 
fight against Iraq. 
  Whoever thought that someone who saying this would invade a 
country to destroy it and try to kill its rulers. Who knows 
whether he would have stopped there or gone further. In his 
message to Iran, Saddam Husayn said: There are 800 kms of 
maritime border between me and you. This meant that the United 
Arab Emirates was included. 
  Then it became clear that he had a huge nuclear force and 
apparently was in need of the oil money to develop it and become 
the third power in the world. The invasion took place. I was 
shocked and could not believe it. I thought that he would stop 
at the disputed area and the issue would be over, but he had 
expansionist ambitions and was planning for them. 
  I was with him one week earlier and he promised me that 
nothing would happen. He told me: I will not take any action 
against Kuwait. He and others denied that this ever happened, 
but it was clear, in black and white. Saddam Husayn denied that 
this happened and said that he had witnesses. Who are they? The 
two delegations, Egyptian and Iraqi, were on the lower floor and 
Saddam and I were on the upper floor, and they did not attend 
the meeting we held. 
  [AL-QABAS] The Arab reader must know these details about 
what 
went on when you sat alone with Saddam. 
  [Mubarak] When I found out that the threats were continuing 
and the foreign media was talking about troops massing, I said 
it is better to hasten before a mistake is committed since 
prevention is better than a cure. I rose at 0600, 0700 due to 
the time difference, and arrived in Baghdad at 1000. I rode 
with Saddam in his car. I was accompanied by the foreign and 
information ministers. We went to a palace that overlooked a 
lake and went to a hall where we sat alone. I asked him: Do 
you intend to commit aggression against Kuwait? He said: No. 
But don't tell them. I said: There is a big clamor. Do you 
have forces close to them as the news agencies are reporting? 
He said: No, only the usual forces are present. After a long 
discussion we agreed on finding a solution at a meeting to be 
held between an Iraqi delegation and a Kuwaiti one and that the 
first meeting would be held in Jeddah. I did not propose Cairo 
but Jeddah with King Fahd. Saddam at first refused. I told him 
that this was better than having them come to meet with you in 
Baghdad, after all that you have done and where they would feel 
powerless, or you going to Kuwait. Both of you, Iraqi and 
Kuwaiti leaders, come to a third country and prepare the 
atmosphere at the first meeting for later. Then you will meet 
one time here and one time in Kuwait. Those were my exact 
words. After a long discussion, he agreed on holding the first 
meeting in Jeddah. I still had not informed King Fahd. 
  At the end of our closed meeting, we went together to the 
lower floor where we had lunch with the delegations' members. 
The issue of Kuwait was not broached at all at the table. He 
kept talking about the hall and other general issues. The 
meeting ended at this point. 
  Before I traveled to Kuwait, Tariq 'Aziz made a statement in 
which he said that the meeting between Presidents Mubarak and 
Saddam did not concern the Kuwaiti question but bilateral 
relations. 
  I read the statement on the plane and asked: Is this 
statement necessary? When I landed, the Kuwaiti brothers asked 
me. I said that the matter might be designed to pressure you. 
I told the amir: Give them some money and silence them. I left 
the amir after he promised that he would answer me on the 
question of the meeting. The next day I went to Saudi Arabia, 
where I met with King Fahd and told him that I had proposed the 
meetings. He said: Brother, whatever you want. The second day 
they told me that the meeting would be one of protocol. Saddam 
was saying that it was a protocol meeting. He spoke to me about 
a meeting, but then he invaded Kuwait. Then why did you agree 
with me on a meeting in Jeddah, then in Kuwait, and then in 
Baghdad? Are you deceiving me? The lack of frankness and 
deception of people causes dismay and exasperation. 
  [AL-QABAS] As for us the Kuwaitis, is there anything new 
regarding Kuwaiti prisoners in Iraq? I am not asking as a 
reporter, but as a man who is related to some of the captives. 
  [Mubarak] We have tried in many ways, and we are still 
trying, despite Iraq's denial that it has any Kuwaiti captives. 
  [AL-QABAS] Can we say that Egyptian-Gulf relations are cool, 
or that there is a retreat in bilateral contacts in general? 
  [Mubarak] Who said so? I had a telephone conversation with 
Shaykh 'Isa (the amir of Bahrain) yesterday, King Fahd 
telephoned me a week ago, and my brother the amir of Kuwait 
spoke with me some time ago, and so did Shaykh Zayid. Qatar's 
foreign minister was here with me; he left and will return on 
Saturday. I do not know why the press is talking about cool 
relations. 
  Our relations with our brothers in the Gulf and in all Arab 
countries are not cool. We are a big country in the region; we 
do not antagonize this one or that one. We support right. 
Although we and Iraq were together in the Arab Cooperation 
Council, we stood against Saddam Husayn when he attacked Kuwait. 
Syria asks us to help its cause, and we do; the Palestinians do 
not stop asking for support. But we must say that we provide 
help and support only when we are asked to. 
  The talks in Cairo are between the Palestinians and the 
Israelis. When we are asked to help, we speak with the Israelis 
and the Americans and we reach understandings. We do not impose 
agreements or things on any party; we only provide our expertise 
and opinion and use our influence in the right place and at the 
right time. 
  [AL-QABAS] After this last question on foreign policy, we 
will move to domestic issues. What is the latest in 
Egyptian-Iranian relations? Why is Iran's role in the regional 
order being neglected? What are the conditions for Iran's 
participation in this order and the protection of the Gulf? 
  [Mubarak] There is nothing wrong between Egypt and Iran. We 
would have wished not to have our relations with Iran, or indeed 
with any other country, frozen. I am eager for good relations 
with all countries. Iran is a Gulf state; I extended a hand to 
it and am ready to cooperate with it provided that no side 
interferes in the internal affairs of the other. But Iran is 
trying to interfere. 
  I remember that Iran slandered us at one point under the 
slogan of liberating Jerusalem. I tell those who want to 
liberate Jerusalem to go and do it; Jerusalem cannot be 
liberated by abusing us. We do not prevent anyone from 
liberating Jerusalem. But this age no longer accepts mere talk, 
inflammatory rhetoric, and accusations of others. These are 
soon exposed, thanks to the communications revolution the world 
is experiencing. Nothing can be hidden now. Lies soon become 
exposed in two or three days. I like nothing but realism. If I 
can do something, I say I can, if I cannot, I say I cannot, even 
if this does not please others. 
  Regarding Iran's position, I believe that the Arab 
countries, notably the Gulf countries, can defend themselves 
through cooperation. These countries are in no need of Iran or 
any other country. They can coordinate among themselves. They 
have huge financial and material resources that enable them to 
draw up a strong defense plan against any aggression. What 
counts is good intentions and clear vision. They don't need 
Iran or even Egypt. However, being an Arab state and member of 
the Arab League and committed to Arab agreements, Egypt will not 
hesitate to protect the Gulf when asked to do so. Egypt has no 
ambitions on the land or anything else possessed by its 
neighbors. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, what is the latest development in 
the Lockerbie issue? 
  [Mubarak] The issue is at a standstill. We have done a great 
deal to resolve it, but it seems that it has calmed down for 
some time. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, we cannot broach the issue of 
Libya 
without mentioning the issue of Mansur al-Kikhya. Is there 
anything new about this humanitarian issue? 
  [Mubarak] Al-Kikhya used to meet with Libyan visitors from 
Libya. He would go out with them on his own and travel with 
them to Alexandria alone. At the Ambassador Hotel, where he was 
staying, he would go out with various individuals. Also, Ahmad 
Qadhdhaf al-Damm visited him. Numerous possibilities are 
conceivable. There is a possibility that they have taken him 
somewhere. They might have travelled by any passport or by a 
Libyan passport because he used to deal and travel with them. 
He is likely to have left with them in a vehicle across the 
border. Vehicles belonging to the consulate leave Egypt for 
Libya daily. For your information, the Libyan-Egyptian borders 
are open and Libyans come and go without passports but with 
identity cards. 
  If al-Kikhya himself goes out with them alone and they come 
to him from Libya daily and go out at night, what can we do? If 
he was afraid, why would he go out with them for dinners at 
night? They once accompanied him in a vehicle to Alexandria. 
There is a quarter in Alexandria called the Hayy al-Magharibah 
where thousands of Libyans live. Can the Egyptian security 
agencies watch everything? Summing up, no one can tell for sure 
where and how al-Kikhya disappeared. We asked the Libyan 
officials but they denied their connection with his 
disappearance. You know that there are opposition Libyan 
figures living in Egypt such as al-Huni, former Prime Minister 
al-Bakkush, and others. There are other Libyan opponents whom 
no one can harm because we know them and know their residences 
and where they go. As for al-Kikhya, we were surprised by his 
arrival without notice or request to protect him and we were 
surprised by his disappearance. We have an agreement with the 
Libyans to respect political refugees. They have not assaulted 
anyone. Al-Kikhya arrived here in transit and he used to go out 
here and there. 
  [AL-QABAS] If we move to the issue of the internal 
situation in Egypt, the agenda of your third term in office is 
crowded with the issue of completing the economic reform, 
promoting the national dialogue, confronting terrorism, and 
continuing development. Can the priorities be listed, and what 
has been achieved? 
  [Mubarak] Economic reform and development are continuing. 
All that you mentioned is continuing. The development of the 
infrastructure utilities is continuing. All our efforts are now 
focused on achieving stability because there can be no 
development, life, or production without stability and no safety 
for capital without stability. Some media organizations, 
especially Western ones, are exaggerating. Even if a person 
throws an aerosol can, it is exaggerated. I do not believe that 
governments are the source of this exaggeration but the press. 
Anyhow, we are persisting and continuing our course. 
  One of the groups that committed a terrorist act in front of 
one of the banks in al-Jizah Square said they did it to revenge 
"those who died in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque." The majority of 
these people are not Muslims or anything else. 
  This is an insult to Islam. Islam has nothing to do with 
these actions. This is proof that they are far removed from 
Islam. They are a gang of criminals who get paid from abroad 
and have been sentenced since the days of President al-Sadat. 
They get paid from abroad and from others in the region and I 
know this. 
  [AL-QABAS] But they are having an effect. They have reached 
the information minister, the prime minister, and almost reached 
you, Mr. President, in the rest house. 
  [Mubarak] I do not have a rest house there. They are 
confused. They plant something with the aim of hitting just any 
person. All their attempts had failed and God willed that those 
perpetrators be exposed so that they can be tried. Egypt's 
security organs are strong and capable of chasing and exposing 
all these criminals. Sooner or later, they are apprehended after 
every crime they commit and no one escapes justice. 
  [AL-QABAS] What have you done then to confront them? Have 
you started a dialogue with them? 
  [Mubarak] We are not opposed to a dialogue. We have spent 11 
years in a dialogue with them since the death of al-Sadat. The 
dialogue gave them the opportunity to establish themselves. But 
we rejected this when they started to use weapons. Our police 
are loath to use weapons against citizens regardless of their 
crimes but they started to shoot after becoming the target of 
perfidy. Think of it: a policeman began to shoot when the issue 
became a matter of life or death for him or the terrorist. The 
police have been forced to defend themselves. But, by God's 
will, they will not be shaken by this. 
  I, with all the Egyptians, am capable of getting through 
this 
stage and achieving stability. We have full control. A look at 
history shows us that they were the ones that killed al-Naqrashi 
Pasha [prime minister under King Faruq] and tried to kill Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir. We in Egypt have an accumulated experience of 
confronting these criminal attempts and must expect them. But 
this is not limited to Egypt alone. Someone tried to 
assassinate U.S. President Clinton and another England's Crown 
Prince Charles. There was also an attempt to assassinate 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Not a single European country has escaped 
terrorism. 
  The president expressed surprise that some European 
countries 
have accepted some terrorists and granted them political asylum, 
even though they have been sentenced to death. He said: I warn 
these countries that they will pay the price sooner or later at 
the hands of these people. 
  [AL-QABAS] Such as 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman in the United 
States? 
  [Mubarak] I do not want to talk about the United States 
because this caused trouble for us there. The Americans 
believed I had known the terrorists would do something at the 
World Trade Center, but I was only giving general warnings 
before the incident. Be careful, the terrorist groups will play 
in your country, I would warn. Then, after the attack against 
the center, they asked if we had prior information. The fact is 
that we did not have prior information, but our warnings were 
based on our knowledge of those groups and their methods. Those 
who receive these terrorists, these fugitives, will deeply 
regret it. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, each phenomenon has its positive 
as well as its negative sides. What did Egypt lose in its war 
against terrorism and what did it gain? 
  [Mubarak] The main negative point was the impact on tourism 
in Luxor and Aswan, although tourism in Luxor is better now. 
But we won over the people; they are against any terrorist, and 
they are active in arresting them. We won the public's 
solidarity, and this is our biggest strength. We lost some 
revenue from tourism but we gained in the fact that the people 
discovered that this terrorism is removed from Islam. They 
claimed they were working for Islam, but they are only a group 
of hired people. One of them received 44,000 pounds to 
assassinate the prime minister. 
  [AL-QABAS] Where did the money come from? 
  [Mubarak] It does not come directly from the source; it 
moves 
from one place to another and finally comes from Afghanistan. 
It is most likely that your Iranian neighbors are the ones who 
pay 44,000 pounds. Instead of distributing the sum among his 
team, this person bought a private car for 26,000 pounds and 
gave 10,000 as a down payment for an apartment. He is a plumber 
who worked and made money, but he was tempted by 44,000 pounds 
coming in one installment without effort. He paid 5,000 pounds 
as marriage expenses. So he spent 41,000 pounds altogether. He 
then put 2,000 pounds in his pocket and distributed the rest 
among the others. He was arrested the next day after he bought 
the car. Regrettably, this is an Egyptian who does not 
appreciate what he is doing. He gets a little money, but he 
does not appreciate how this affects the country. 
  [AL-QABAS] According to some press reports, the Egyptian 
Government has accused some quarters in the Gulf of financing 
terrorist operations. Is this true? 
  [Mubarak] Some time ago, there were some nongovernmental 
societies that helped and paid, but mostly with good intentions. 
Thy imagined they were donating for charity or for building 
mosques; they did not know where the money went and how it was 
used. I spoke with the governments in the Gulf. They were not 
paying attention to this, but now they are taking it into 
consideration. 
  [AL-QABAS] What, then, is the possibility of cooperation 
with the moderate Islamic trend, specifically the Muslim 
Brotherhood? 
  [Mubarak] The Muslim Brotherhood is an illegal society; 
there 
is nothing called Muslims and Muslim brothers. We are all 
Muslims. Egypt's Constitution does not allow the formation of 
parties on a religious basis, as this would mean dividing 
Muslims. If you are not convinced of their ideas, and if you do 
not join them, they accuse you of blasphemy. The Muslim 
Brotherhood is a political society. If I approve an Islamic 
party, I will have to approve a second Islamic party, and a 
third, perhaps a Christian party, and then a Jewish party may 
emerge, and then a secular one. The Islamic parties are 
attacking each other. Do you think they have good relations 
among each other? We have many examples to the contrary. This 
will turn the county into a bloody theater. Religion is for God 
and the homeland is for all. All Muslims are equal; no Muslim 
is better than the other unless he is more pious and closer to 
God. Classifying people into Muslim brothers, non-Muslim 
brothers, and infidels means dividing society. 
  [AL-QABAS] Mr. President, my last question is: How long will 
the post of vice president remain vacant? 
  [Mubarak] I would like to say a very important thing: The 
Egyptian Constitution determines how power is transferred. If 
something happens to the president of the republic, the People's 
Assembly speaker takes over, which is what happened after the 
death of al-Sadat. If the People's Assembly is nonexistent for 
any reason, the president of the Higher Constitutional Court 
takes over as an interim president until the nomination of a new 
president is completed. The Constitution does not state that I 
must appoint a vice president, but allows the president to 
appoint a deputy or deputies, and also allows him to appoint 
assistants. I have noticed that the presence of a deputy or 
deputies in the past caused struggles and produced cliques, 
which divided the country. I do not want this. I am building 
the country and I have no time for such things. But I will 
appoint a deputy at the right time, although this is not easy. 
Consider how many times Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir appointed deputies 
and later dismissed them. I received a letter from a person 
telling me not to appoint a deputy so that the presidency will 
not be inherited; I laughed. 
  [AL-QABAS] Shall we take it that you will not appoint a 
deputy in the near future? 
  [Mubarak] Not in the near future, but the time will come 
when 
I appoint one. There were rumors some time ago that I would 
appoint this person or that person, but I must chose a fully 
qualified person with integrity who may run for president later. 
But he may run and fail because the People's Assembly may not 
nominate him. 
  My selection of a deputy must be accurate. I do not want to 
appoint one and change him after some time. The vice president, 
moreover, does not have specific powers. Anyway, the Egyptian 
Constitution specifies how power is transferred, but the time 
will come when I appoint a deputy. When? I will not say.

  [Text] The People's Assembly held a session this morning 
under Speaker Ahmad Fathi Surur. The Assembly looked into a 
number of briefing requests addressed to Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa on the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  Minister 'Amr Musa then addressed the Assembly, saying that 
the Hebron massacre has shocked the Egyptian president, 
Government, and people. Musa pointed out that Egypt was the 
first country to denounce the massacre, its perpetrators, and 
the policies that led to it. Egypt, he added, voiced the need 
to curb Israeli extremism and provide measures for protecting 
the Palestinians. 
  The foreign minister said that President Husni Mubarak 
instructed Egyptian officials to support the Palestinian demand 
for a UN Security Council session to discuss the massacre. 
President Mubarak also got in touch with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat several times, stressing his and Egypt's support 
for the Palestinians at this critical juncture. The two 
Presidents reviewed the measures that should be taken to 
guarantee the safety of Palestinians and prevent the settlers 
from terrorizing them. 
  Minister Musa said that Egypt's reaction to the massacre was 
guided by a number of basic principles. Egypt has firmly 
condemned the massacre. Egypt has stated that responsibility 
for the massacre is not confined to the perpetrator; that Israel 
has a clear and specific responsibility for it. Egypt has made 
it clear that Israeli settlements are illegitimate and that they 
hamper the peace efforts and undermine tranquility and stability 
in the occupied territories. The settlements, Egypt believes, 
conflict with the rights of the Palestinian people in their land 
as well as with International law. Egypt has called on Israel 
to take measures to disarm the settlers. 
  Minister Musa said that the massacre should fortify our 
resolve to seek a peace settlement that is based on the exchange 
of land for peace and guarantees the restoration of Palestinian 
rights. 
  The foreign minister said that negotiations should continue 
because Israel must not be left in control of Arab land. He 
pointed to the unanimous world condemnation of the massacre. 
  The People's Assembly issued a statement strongly denouncing 
the barbaric crime, saying that it violates all ethical 
principles and norms of international law. The statement says 
that the Israeli Government, being the occupation authority, is 
responsible for the massacre. It condemns Israel's failure to 
offer protection to civilians living in the occupied territories 
in the face of repeated acts of repression and terror. This 
failure, the statement adds, fuels the spirit of fanaticism and 
hatred and invites the recurrence of atrocities. 
  The Assembly referred Foreign Minister Musa's speech and the 
deputies' comments to an ad hoc parliamentary committee to 
follow up this matter with the government and keep the Assembly 
fully briefed on the subject.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood on the Hebron </F>
incident] 
  [Text] (But they ever strive to do mischief on earth. And 
God loveth not those who do mischief.) [Koranic verse] 
  God says: (Not will they cease fighting you until they turn 
you back from your faith if they can. [Koranic verse] 
  While the Zionist enemy is waving the mirage of peace, an 
officer from the occupation army stormed into the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque at dawn today to kill more than 90 unarmed worshipers 
kneeling in prayer. The treacherous occupation army finished off 
the rest, thus raising the number of the massacre victims. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood strongly condemns this ugly criminal 
incident which shows the perfidious and corrupt nature inherent 
in the treacherous enemy. They call on the international 
community to hold an urgent Security Council session to discuss 
the status of the Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, 
and Jerusalem; to place these areas under international 
supervision; and to send international forces to protect 
unarmed civilians, women, and children and protect the Islamic 
and Christian holy places. They also call for holding free 
elections under neutral international supervision to choose 
representatives of the Palestinian people in this part of 
Palestine, which the United Nations admits is under occupation, 
so as to govern these areas, protect its people, and manage 
their affairs. They demand that no agreement, which has been 
drawn without their will and where their opinion has not been 
legitimately sought, be imposed on this people. 
  This ugly incident clearly indicates the aggressive nature 
of 
the Zionist enemy who has gathered [the Jews] scattered all over 
the world, usurped the country, and expelled its owners who have 
become either refugees or displaced persons, or are living under 
repression and occupation. This is a racist, aggressive, and 
expansionist entity that does not acknowledge or seek peace and 
waves the banners of peace only to deceive and to achieve 
further expansion and superiority. 
  The Arab and Islamic nation is called upon at this critical 
time to rally under the banner of Islam (And hold fast, all 
together, by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be 
not divided among yourselves) [Koranic verse], make ready your 
strength to the utmost to deter aggression and protect the 
innocent, and not to slip into the false mirage. The continued 
full boycott of the Zionist enemy is a pressing demand under 
these circumstances until the full rights of the Arab and 
Islamic people in the land of Palestine are restored. 
  O Islamic peoples. The path of Islam is the path to 
deliverance. Applying God Almighty's shari'ah is the way to 
retrieve rights and attain sovereignty. 
  O steadfast Palestinian people: Hold on to your religion. 
Hold on to your land. Lift up the intifadah all over 
Palestine. Raise the banner of jihad because it is the only way 
to attain glory, dignity, independence, and life. 
  (So lose no heart, nor fall into despair: for ye must gain 
mastery if ye are true in Faith) (If a wound hath touched you, 
be sure a similar wound hath touched the others) [Koranic 
verses] 
  Know ye that the Islamic nation in general and the Arab one 
in particular are supporting you with all their might and 
resources and their hearts are with you. They are waiting for 
the day when they break the shackles that are preventing them 
from participating effectively with you in liberating the whole 
holy land. Tomorrow is not that far away. And God hath full 
power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know 
it not. [Koranic verse] 
  God is great. 
  Thanks be to God and God's prayers and peace be with our 
master Muhammad, his scion, and his companions. 
  [Signed] Muhammad Hamid Abu-al-Nasr. 
  General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood.

<F P=106> [From the "Days" column by Jalal 'Arif: And they are asking </F>
us for self-restraint] 
  [Text] Thus is normalization! 
  Yes. These are the normal relations as seen by a gang that 
has usurped our territories and established a state. It knows 
that it was established through terrorism and that it will 
continue to exist through terrorism. 
  Thus is normalization. Palestinians kneeling in prayer to 
God in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron are killed by the 
Israelis' bullets. This picture is an accurate representation 
of Israeli terrorism and a summing up of the Arab tragedy. 
Countless Arab revolutionaries and rulers had earlier knelt in 
Washington seeking protection and offering their obedience and 
loyalty in hopes that thrones and regimes whose lifespans ended 
several years ago might continue to exist and in the hope that 
"leaders" who have gone bankrupt and whose roles have come to an 
end might find some new role, even if it means serving Israel. 
  The massacre has now come to expose the truth of everything. 
It comes in the midst of a big clamor selling illusions of 
peace and depicting the agreements for total capitulation as 
historic solutions. The massacre reminds everyone that even 
total capitulation will not make them show mercy to anyone but 
merely gives the enemy a wonderful opportunity to practice 
terrorism. They have not and will not abandon their Zionism. 
Hence, in their view, the battle will continue until they 
establish their "promised" kingdom from the Euphrates to the 
Nile and until they control the water, resources, oil, and land. 
Everything is permissible for this purpose and nothing outside 
this design is of any value. 
  The massacre also reminds those who have forgotten or 
pretend 
to have forgotten of the real relationship between Israel and 
the United States. They are saying that the killer is American, 
mad, and an Israeli. Regardless of the naivity of the claim 
that the crime was committed by a single person acting amid the 
tight security thrown around the site, the truth that should be 
apparent to us is this: the real criminals in this crime, as in 
other crimes, are the U.S. and Israeli governments. It is the 
Israeli government that has been built on terrorism, that 
constructed the settlements, armed the settlers, gave them 
money, weapons and protection, and pushed them into practicing 
terrorism against the Arabs, and then released the killers 
following nearly farcical trials. It is the U.S. Administration 
which has supported all this and turned the Jewish gangs into a 
state and the state into a gang that takes all it wants from the 
United States -- ranging from financial, military, and political 
support, and even the tools of terrorism such as Goldstein and 
his ilk used, to atomic power and missiles. 
  What will happen after the massacre is very well-known -- 
advice for self-restraint and this U.S. call: "Forget what 
happened, and let us play, or negotiate, so that the peace 
process will not stop!" 
  As for self-restraint, we have practiced it, willingly or 
unwillingly, for many years, and now we see the result. When we 
hear the Likud leader, who is a candidate for prime minister 
after Rabin, expressing appreciation that there are many people 
like Goldstein among the settlers, what can we say to those who 
shout in our faces saying: We demand the blood of our sons' 
killers in every case and regardless of the place; anyone allied 
with them is a traitor; revenge is a must; there are plenty of 
guns available and also madmen. 
  As regards the negotiations, everybody knows they will only 
lead to further concessions. Those who want peace must return 
to international legitimacy. Let the beginning be a full 
withdrawal from all occupied territories, removal of all the 
settlements, and the recognition of the Palestinian people's 
rights. Without this, any talk about peace and stability in the 
region is nothing but a mirage. 
  The leadership of the organization that was established to 
liberate Palestine should return to the right course and stop 
what it began in Oslo. Otherwise, it should leave the scene 
rather than lead its people to be massacred without resistance. 
  And the trumpets here that call for turning the cold peace 
with Israel into a warm one should stop. Let them tell us how 
peace can be established between the killer and the victim, and 
how do Israeli bananas taste in their throats when they are 
stained with the blood of the martyrs [reference to the 
agriculture minister's admission that Egypt imports bananas from 
Israel] 
  As for us, we have no choice but to resist to the end. 
Therefore, we call upon all those who believe in a just and 
comprehensive peace and who refuse to surrender to Israeli 
hegemony to engage in serious work to establish a popular 
organization that will serve as a spearhead in the prolonged 
battle against the Zionist presence on the soil of Egypt in all 
its shapes; an organization opposed to normalization and a 
Middle East market; an organization that will muster all efforts 
to support the Palestinian intifadah and mobilize the masses 
against the Israeli-American conspiracy against our national 
security and pan-Arab interests. 
  We have only two choices: To resist despite difficulties in 
order to impose a just and honorable peace of the strong, or to 
submit to the status quo, eat Williams bananas, entertain 
ourselves with what they call "the challenge" [catch phrase in 
articles by the chief editors of government newspapers that call 
for a warmer peace with Israel], place our fate in the hands of 
Israel and the United States, and receive congratulations for 
self-restraint while turning ourselves into a nation of refugees 
and martyrs.

  [Text] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the peace talks, has stressed the need for the 
issue of settlements to top the agenda of any 
Palestinian-Israeli talks in the future. In a statement to our 
radio, he pointed out that failing to include the question of 
settlements in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks will make 
these talks pointless. He noted that the Palestinian side had 
called for the need to discuss the question of settlements 
before the Oslo agreement was signed to ensure protection for 
the Palestinians. 
  Dr. 'Urayqat added that the Palestinian people want peace 
more than any other party. He expressed fears for the possible 
recurrence of the Israeli massacres against citizens in the 
occupied Arab territories. He emphasized the need for 
international protection to ensure that such incidents may not 
recur in the future.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM has 
emphasized that the problems resulting from the widening scope 
of extremist actions in the region requires that their impact on 
the Middle East peace process be neutralized. This problem 
requires a radical solution because the developments over the 
past two years have shown that such a solution is in the best 
interests of all parties. In an editorial today, the paper says 
that it is insufficient to disarm the extremists in settlements 
or even to impose international protection of the Palestinians 
as a temporary measure until the issue of settlements has been 
resolved, noting that a basic solution lies in deporting the 
settlers and extremists from the occupied land. 
  AL-AHRAM states that the Israeli views of keeping the 
settlements in the occupied territories have become 
old-fashioned given the new realities of Jewish extremism. The 
paper says that certain facts about Jewish extremism that 
emerged after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre showed that there 
are training camps and command posts that extend to the United 
States. In addition, these realities demonstrated the American 
Jews' support for the Jewish extremists in Israel and inside the 
occupied territories, a fact that has made the U.S. 
Administration express its concern.

<F P=106> [Report by Muna Qasim: "The Monthly Report for February </F>
Issued by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center 
Paints a Vivid Picture of the Performance of the Egyptian 
Economy in 1993"] 
  [Text] The February issue of the Egyptian Monthly Bulletin, 
a monthly survey of major economic indicators published by the 
Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre (IDSC) 
summarised the performance of the economy. Egypt's economic 
performance in 1993 reflects the positive results of two years 
of ambitious economic reform, during which the national economy 
faced and overcame many of the challenges which arose in 1991 
and 1992. 
  One of the most notable features of 1993 is the decline of 
annual inflation rates. According to the IDSC report, the 
annual average rate of inflation fell from 13.6 per cent in 
December 1992 to 12.1 per cent in December 1993. These figures 
are based on the consumer goods index of 1992, when the annual 
inflation rate reached 9.3 per cent, compared to 20.3 per cent 
in the previous year. 
  This is attributable to the declining price indices of a 
number of groups of consumer goods with the exception of rents, 
fuel, sports facilities, education and cultural activities. 
  As part of the economic reform plan, which depends on market 
mechanisms to achieve economic balance, the pricing structure 
continued to be adjusted during 1992 and 1993 to reflect the 
real cost of services and commodities. Last year, measures were 
applied to rid the state budget of the burden of subsidies and 
cut the budget deficit. The application of the sales tax was 
also expanded in scope. The fall of the annual inflation rate 
to 12.1 per cent in December 1993, however, resulted from the 
decline in the wholesale index, especially in commodity groups 
such as foodstuffs, tobacco, and clothing which has offset the 
effect of increases in the prices of oil and fuel. 
  Monetary policies applied since 1991 have attained two major 
goals: foreign exchange rates have been stabilised and interest 
rates have gradually been cut. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) 
in 1993 continued its policy of holding liquidity in check and 
stabilising exchange rates, which coincided with the downward 
trend of interest rates on savings in local currency. Exchange 
rates maintained a relative stability during 1993, with the CBE 
interfering to buy foreign currencies. The US dollar rate 
increased from PT [piasters] 333.75 in January 1993 to 336.95 in 
December 1993. During the course of the year, the Egyptian 
pound declined by only one per cent against the dollar which 
suggests that monetary policies designed to eliminate the 
dollarisation of the economy were successful. 
  Parallels can also be drawn with the stability of the 
Egyptian pound against the pound sterling, the German mark, the 
French franc, the yen and the ECU. The exchange rate of the 
Egyptian pound against these currencies fluctuated between 1 and 
1.5 per cent, which affirms the stability of the foreign rates. 
  In September, 1993 the number of licensed foreign exchange 
companies reached 72, with 57 branches and a total capital of LE 
[Egyptian pounds] 129.385 million. These companies have 
accounted for $700 million in net foreign currency revenues. 
Meanwhile, the CBE stuck to its policy of intervention, to 
maintain the stability of foreign exchange rates and enhance its 
foreign currency reserves. Until June 1993 the CBE purchased 
around $7.1 billion, of which it used $1.9 billion, bringing net 
purchases to $5.2 billion. 
  In 1993, monetary policies continued to achieve three main 
goals: these were to hold the expansion of liquidity in check, 
to stabilise the rate of exchange of the US dollar and to cut 
interest rates on savings held in Egyptian pounds, in order to 
encourage investment and to push forward economic development. 
  To achieve these goals, the CBE resorted to several 
measures. 
These included the cancellation of credit ceilings on loans to 
the private sector as of October 1992 and on loans to the public 
sector as of July 1993. There was also a trend towards 
decreasing the issue of new treasury bills, to strike a balance 
between the need to curb the state budget deficit and to keep 
liquidity in the national economy at a suitable level. 
  The IDSC figures suggest a link between declining average 
returns on treasury bills and the downward trend in interest 
rates on bank deposits in the period January 1993 to January 
1994. Interest rates on Treasury bills reached 16.2 per cent in 
January 1993, as opposed to a discount rate of 18.55 per cent. 
By December 1993 the interest rates on Treasury Bonds reached 
14.45 per cent. The significant improvement in the budget 
deficit, which went down to 3.6 in 1993, has led to a decrease 
in the issuance of new bills. As a part of the liberalisation 
of banking services, the minimum interest rate of 12 per cent on 
three-month deposits made in Egyptian pounds was cancelled in 
1993. Taking into consideration the relationship between 
interest rates on short-term bank deposits and those on 
short-term treasury bills, interest rates on bank deposits have 
markedly decreased, to 15.25 per cent in December 1993. 
Accordingly, the CBE's lending and discount rates went down to 
16.58 per cent by the end of 1993 and then dropped further, to 
16.25 per cent, at the beginning of 1994. Thus, the CBE has 
managed to achieve its monetary and credit policies, which 
implies that the economic reform plan has succeeded in making a 
positive impact on the performance of the banking system. 
  As far as Egypt's economic relations with foreign countries 
are concerned, the balance of payments achieved a surplus in 
1993 due to the surplus of the current accounts balance achieved 
over the past three years. However, the aggregate surplus was 
less than that achieved in the previous year, due to the growing 
deficit in the trade balance and the declining surplus of the 
services balance. 
  According to the statistics published by IDSC, the balance 
of 
trade deficit increased by $7.315 billion in 1993, compared with 
$6.421 billion in 1992. This increase is attributable to the 
decline in exports to $3.4 billion; at around $216.2 million 
less than the previous year, this represents a decrease of some 
0.6 per cent. This is the result of exports to Russia and the 
other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States being 
cut down by $302.1 million. The decline in exports was felt 
mainly in chemical products, textiles and agricultural products, 
while exports of crude oil and oil products increased. 
  Egypt's imports, meanwhile, increased by $677.7 million or 
around 6.7 per cent, to reach $10.7 billion. According to some 
monthly statistics revealed by the IDSC, the balance of payments 
deficit reached $575.93 million in November 1992, an increase of 
around 107.8 per cent over the base year 1990. 
  In October 1993, the deficit reached $470.39 million, an 
87.46 per cent increase over the base year, and rose to $516.28 
million in November 1993, an increase of around 95.99 per cent 
over the base year. These figures suggest that the deficit 
rates are relatively the same, as a result of the exports 
decline already mentioned. 
  The fiscal year 1992-93 is the first year of the third 
five-year socio-economic development plan, which runs from 
1992/93 to 1996/97. This third five-year plan focuses on 
developing the commodity sectors at rates of growth above the 
rate of population growth, with the aim of improving living 
standards, as well as striking a balance between the growth of 
expenditure and production to control prices. In addition to 
this, the five-year plan aims to promote the tourism industry as 
a renewable source of foreign currency. 
  The figures released by the IDSC indicate that the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP), calculated at 1987 prices, increased by 
2.8 per cent in 1992 as against 2.3 per cent in 1991 and 2.5 per 
cent in 1990. 
  According to the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and 
Statistics, population growth decreased to 2.1 per cent in 
1992/93, compared to 2.3 per cent in the previous fiscal year. 
This is an encouraging sign, since the growth of GDP, at 2.8 
per cent, exceeded population growth. However, more population 
control is needed at the same time as GDP increases, to minimise 
the burdens of overpopulation on development and the labour 
market. 
  The tourism industry is considered an important source for 
foreign currency, but IDSC statistics reveal two important 
points. The first is that the number of nights spent by tourists 
in Egypt has declined from 21,318,000 in January 1992 to 
15,089,000 in January 1993; the second is that tourism revenues 
have declined from $2,138 million between January and November 
1992 to around $1,290 million during the same period in 1993. 
The same statistics show that the number of tourists went down 
from 200,000 in December, 1992 to 172,000 in December 1993; the 
number of nights spent by tourists in Egypt decreased from 
1,082,000 in December 1992 to 912,000 in December 1993. The 
decline took place despite efforts to promote Egypt's tourism 
industry to offset the negative effects of terrorist acts.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--The leaders of the 12 Somali 
factions have agreed on a unified concept of an action program 
proposed to settle the Somali problem, after their meetings in 
Cairo over the past two days. Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the 
Unified Somali Conference, declared this program today. The 
program includes the following: 
  1. Establishing a salvation council of 17 members made up of 
all 15 groups, including General Mohamad Farah Aidid as well as 
the leader of the National Somali Movement in the north. Ali 
Mahdi Mohamed will have a seat on the council according to the 
Addis Ababa resolutions. The chairmanship of the council will 
alternate. 
  2. The first chairman of the Salvation Council will form a 
provisional government of qualified Somali cadres. He will also 
complete the formation of the transitional national council, 
which will end the task of the salvation council. 
  3. The salvation council will assume the task of enacting 
legislations, completing the transitional phase, and supervising 
the building of state institutions. 
  Consultations will be held with the National Somali Movement 
and the National Somali Coalition to participate in implementing 
this program through a delegation that will be sent to meet with 
General Aidid for this purpose.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5 (AFP)--The Iranian parliament on 
Saturday [5 March] called for a Palestinian armed struggle 
against Israel until the Jewish state disappeared from the face 
of the earth. 
  "We declare that the problem of Zionism will only be solved 
through armed struggle against Israel until the cancerous tumor 
disappears from the map of the world," said a statement from 
deputies, read out in parliament. 
  The deputies condemned the February 25 massacre of Moslem 
worshipers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron, 
and warned against using the "painful tragedy" as a catalyst for 
progress in the Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  They also slammed the international community's "treacherous 
silence" over the "shocking crime." 
  Palestinian doctors say 52 Arabs were killed in the 
shooting, 
while the Israeli army has put the toll at 30. 
  On Friday Iranian spiritual guide Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i 
called for a massive uprising against Israel, with the backing 
of the Islamic world. 
  Fathi al-Shiqaqi, head of the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad 
in 
Palestine group, vowed here Saturday that Palestinian militants 
would soon launch revenge attacks against Israel in retaliation 
for the Hebron massacre.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5 (AFP) -- Iran could improve ties 
with its arch-enemy the United States if Washington began 
settling financial disputes with the Islamic Republic, a 
newspaper close to Islamic hardliners said here Saturday. 
  The KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, an English-language newspaper, 
said 
a "solution may be found to the animosity" between Iran and the 
United States if Washington could prove it was "sincere" about 
improving ties. 
  "As a first step, Washington should release" billions of 
dollars in Iranian assets frozen in the United States since 
1979, when Iranian students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran 
and held U.S. nationals hostage, it said. 
  The call by KAYHAN was the first since Tehran ruled out 
negotiations with Washington in November, on the anniversary of 
the embassy siege, and appeared to put to rest speculation about 
attempts to improve ties. 
  Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties 
since 
1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the 
pro-American shah. 
  The paper also urged compensation for the relatives of the 
passengers of an Iranian civilian airliner downed by the U.S. 
Navy over the Gulf. 
  The Iran Air Airbus was shot down by two missiles fired from 
the cruiser USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988, shortly after taking 
off from Bandar-e 'Abbas to Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. 
  The United States has maintained that the shooting was an 
accident, the plane being mistaken for a military aircraft. 
  The daily however voiced doubt that Washington would "ever 
be 
able" to come to terms with the Iranian revolution, or 
understand that Iran "could never be forced to yield" under 
pressure.

  [Text] Tehran, March 4, IRNA -- Chinese deputy prime

'Ali Akbar Velayati. 
  Upon arrival at Mehrabad airport, Qichen told reporters that 
the objective of his trip was to expand bilateral relations and 
to exchange views on international issues. 
  Referring to the Islamic Republic of Iran as an important 
bridge between the European And asian continents, he noted that 
the two countries have common viewpoints on fmany international 
and regional issues. 
  Pointing to significant roles of Iran and China in the 
region, the Chinese official termed Tehran-Beijing relations as 
friendly and traditional. 
  He then strongly condemned the recent massacre of 
Palestinian 
worshippers by the Zionist regime at al-Khalil mosque last 
Friday, adding that the killings have had a negative impression 
on the so- called peace process in the region. 
  On China's reaction towards American allegations of human 
rights violation, Qichen said "we do not let any foreign country 
interfere in our internal affairs. The government is following 
up the matter." 
  Velayati also referred to the two countries ties as 
"important and determining factor" in the region and noted that 
the relationship can be the base of peace and tranquility in the 
region. 
  Iran-China bilateral relation progressed since the triumph 
of 
the Islamic revolution, and important decisions have been taken 
by the two sides, the major part of which has been implemented, 
Velayati remarked.

  [Text] China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister, 
Mr. Qian Qichen, arrived in Tehran on Friday morning and was 
welcomed at Mehrabad International Airport by Foreign Affairs 
Minister Velayati. Mr. Qian and his delegation are expected to 
stay in Iran for two days. A top-ranking political- economic 
delegation accompanies Mr. Qian Qichen in his visit to Iran. 
  Shortly after arriving, China's foreign minister took part 
in 
a press conference, which was also attended by Iran's foreign 
minister. The visiting Chinese official expressed his happiness 
at being in Iran and referred to Sino-Iranian ties as sincere 
and fruitful. Pointing to the Islamic Republic of Iran as a 
country bridging Asia and Europe, Mr. Qian added: The Republic 
of China believes establishing healthy relations with Iran 
should bear positive effects not only in the region, but also in 
the world arena. 
  China's deputy prime minister then referred to the two 
states' economic ties and said: 
  [Begin Qian recording in Chinese, with superimposed English 
translation] The level of trade exchanges between China and Iran 
are satisfactory; declaring that both nations are willing to 
expand reciprocal cooperation in various economic fields. [end 
recording] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Foreign 
Minister, how do you view Mr. Qian's visit to Iran and what 
issues are likely to be discussed between you and your Chinese 
counterpart? 
  [Velayati] In the Name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate. Mr. Qian Qichen is my old friend and has been the 
Foreign Minister of China since a long time ago. During last few 
years he paid one official visit to our country, and this is the 
second official visit which he has paid to our country on the 
basis of my invitation; and we are going to talk about the 
bilateral and also international issues. You know that after 
the Islamic revolution we have promoted our relations with China 
in different fields. And also as far as the international 
affairs are concerned, we have had very close cooperation during 
the last years, especially in the United Nations and other 
international organizations. 
  Recently in Jakarta, China was accepted as an observer in 
the 
Nonaligned Movement. So, not only at the United Nations, but 
also in the Nonaligned Movement we cooperate together. Iran and 
China as two important Asian countries can play a very important 
role for peace and tranquillity in this part of the world. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you. [end recording] 
  Regional issues, including the Palestinian question, are 
among the most crucial topics which the two sides said they will 
take into serious consideration. The Chinese foreign minister 
stated his country strongly condemns the massacre of Muslim 
Palestinians by the Zionist soldiers in the town of Hebron in 
the occupied land. 
  As for the uproar by the West on human rights in China, Mr. 
Qian Qichen said: China does not allow any foreign country to 
interfere in its internal affairs, adding that his country acts 
on the basis of China's judicial laws and system, not on the 
basis of the criteria favored by the West. 
  At the end of the press conference, the two foreign 
ministers 
emphasized joint participation in the international meetings and 
gatherings, and hoped that Iran and China would adopt further 
common policies towards regional and global affairs. 
  Iran and China have long enjoyed most friendly mutual 
relations. Mr. Qian's visit, however, is viewed as an affair to 
further activate the two countries' bilateral cooperation 
concerning regional and international issues.

  [Text] Chinese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Mr. Qian Qichen arrived in Tehran today on an 
official visit. China's foreign minister during his two-day 
visit to Tehran will meet with Iranian officials. The two sides 
will discuss mutual relations, as well as regional and 
international issues. 
  It is well [as heard] to mention that China and Iran have 
their relations since many years ago and, despite ups and downs 
in the world policies, Sino-Iranian relations have always 
enjoyed a positive stability. At this juncture of time, too, 
leaders of the two countries intend to further strengthen their 
friendly relations. 
  Beyond doubt, the expansion of cooperation between Iran and 
China as two independent countries in the East and West Asia 
indicate the significance of the relations in various 
dimensions. Political analysts believe that common cultural and 
deep-rooted Sino-Iranian civilization in the past as well as 
strong ties between the two countries have promoted 
Tehran-Peking relations to a fruitful and strategic level in the 
region and the world. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran and China enjoyed good 
economic, 
trade, political, and cultural relations during the years 
following the culmination of the Islamic revolution in Iran. 
During the years parallel to the regular formation of economic 
joint commission, and tasked by the high-ranking officials of 
the two countries, the volume of trade exchanges between them 
increased to $710 million dollars in 1993. Presently, Iran and 
China have extensive cooperation in the field of energy, 
transportation, telecommunication, mines, industry, agriculture, 
transfer of technology, and exchange of scientific information. 
  In view of the independence of Central Asian Republics 
following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the existence of 
exceptional potentials in Iran and China, the Central Asia has 
presently turned into an area of economic and trade activities 
and has expanded international cooperation among east, west, and 
central Asia. 
  In the meantime, the Islamic Republic of Iran and China have 
identical stands towards international issues, especially the 
U.S. and West pressures against the Third World countries by 
playing an active role. Hence, the two countries' cooperation 
can foil the plots hatched by the enemies. On this basis, 
reciprocal visits by the officials of the two countries and the 
exchanges of views and consultations on various affairs can 
boost the mutual understanding. 
  The visit to Tehran by China's Qian Qichen would undoubtedly 
open a new horizon in expanding the relations between the two 
countries.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani today received Mr. Qian 
Qichen, the Chinese deputy prime minister and foreign affairs 
minister. 
  In the meeting, the president referred to the common 
cultural 
and historic bonds between Iran and China and described the 
further expansion of joint cooperation between the two countries 
for strengthening peace and stability in the world, particularly 
in the Asian continent, as important. He said: Playing a more 
active role on international scenes and confronting foreign 
powers' interference in Asia requires further planning, 
cooperation, and exchange of views among regional countries, 
particularly the two big countries of Iran and China. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said the lack of a serious 
confrontation against the political and economic problems of the 
world today are caused by the illusive perceptions in power 
domination and the creation of new power blocs in the world. He 
said: The threat against the territorial integrity of an 
independent country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of 
Europe, and the continuation of the occupation of the 
Palestinian territory by the usurper Israel, which each day 
opens a new page of aggression and massacre of Muslims in its 
shameful book of history and prevails its anti-peace nature, as 
well as many problems that exist in the countries of Central 
Asia and regional countries, mean that Asian countries and the 
Third World -- which have a mighty power in terms of political 
and economic and manpower resources -- must no longer allow the 
domination seeking powers to interfere under the pretext of 
mediation to solve regional problems and disputes; they should 
themselves take the initiative. 
  The president also stressed the need for further cooperation 
between Iranian and Chinese experts to explore ways to further 
deepen the two countries' relations. 
  China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister conveyed 
the best greetings of the Chinese Government and people to the 
Iranian Government and people. He said: Both Iran and China 
are among the ancient and civilized countries who are connected 
together by deep historial roots. 
  He added: After the the Islamic revolution in Iran, the two 
countries had common political viewpoints on many international 
issues. As a result, the trend of the expansion of bilateral 
relations has accelerated in many fields, especially in economic 
and commercial fields. 
  Mr. Qian said it is necessary for the developing countries 
to 
confront the domineering ambitions of world arrogance. For this 
reason, he said, China is determined to further expand its 
cooperation with countries such as Iran. 
  China's deputy prime minister and foreign minister stressed 
the necessity of strengthening stability and tranquillity in 
Central Asian countries for the sake of the economic and social 
reconstruction of those countries. He said: China supports the 
expansion of the national economies of those countries, and also 
favors closer cooperation with Iran for solving regional issues, 
including among the neighboring countries.

  [Text] At a meeting with Mr. Qian Qichen, visiting deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister of China, First Vice 
President Hasan Habibi--referring to recent global 
developments--said: The resulting situation is significant for 
the major countries of the Asian continent, including China and 
Iran, to strengthen peace and regional stability. He added: The 
Middle East is a sensitive region of the world, and maintaining 
peace and tranquillity in this region can help in achieving 
global peace and stability. 
  The first vice president referred to the developments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Palestine--which have emotionally harmed 
the Muslims--as bitter developments. He asked China, as a 
country enjoying special status on the UN Security Council, to 
play a more active role in confrontation with hegemonic policies 
of the major powers. 
  Habibi described Iran-China ties in all fields of mutual 
interest as extensive and added: In addition to good 
socioeconomic relations, ground could be paved for further 
expansion of mutual ties through cultural cooperation, exchange 
of professors and students between the two countries, provision 
of more suitable means for exchanging the experience gained by 
craftsmen, and the exchange of scientific, technical, and 
industrial experience between Chinese and Iranian experts. 
  At the meeting, the deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister of China termed the panorama of future cooperation 
between Iran and China as promising and added: Mutual 
understanding based on mutual respect, noninterference in each 
other's internal affairs, and support for global and regional 
peace and stability, form some of the joint principles of the 
two countries' foreign policy. 
  He described the existing possibilities for the expansion of 
bilateral cooperation as extensive and desirable and said: Apart 
from the two countries' political, economic, and commercial 
relations, expansion of international cooperation is also 
noteworthy. 
  The latest regional and international developments, as well 
as the trend of cooperation between Tehran and Beijing were 
reviewed during a meeting today between Qian Qichen, Chinese 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and Mr. Velayati, 
our country's foreign minister. 
  At the meeting, the Chinese deputy prime minister considered 
the similar and close views of Tehran and Beijing on many 
international and regional issues to be an effective factor in 
bringing the two countries closer in their friendly relations. 
He said: Tehran-Beijing relations are good, positive, and based 
on mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. 
  The Chinese foreign minister praised Iran's independent 
policy and Tehran's efforts in establishing peace and stability 
in the region--especially in Afghanistan. 
  During the course of the meeting, Mr. Velayati also 
described 
Tehran-Beijing relations as deep-rooted and exemplary. 
  He said: China is capable of playing an important role in 
the implementation of the underground project in Tehran. 
  Iran's foreign minister considered human rights to be a 
weapon that is used by superpowers to interfere in the internal 
affairs of other states. He said: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
seriously and forthrightly opposes the exertion of any influence 
that is aimed at dominating other states.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5, IRNA -- Majlis speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri in a meeting with the Chinese 
Deputy Premier Qian Qichen here today said that there had been 
"no ambiguous juncture" in the long relations between Iran and 
China. Hoj. Nuri said parliamentary relations between the two 
countries are helpful for the expansion of mutual ties in other 
areas. 
  During the meeting the speaker also warned the U.S. against 
any moves which tend to breach the international norms. "The 
U.S. should take lessons from the collapse of the former 
superpower of the Soviet Union, and should not violate 
international norms simply because it has no rival anymore." 
  Referring to the dual attitude of international 
organizations 
towards the killings of the innocent people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina by the racist Serbs as well as the carnage of the 
Palestinian Muslim worshipers by the criminal Zionists, the 
Majlis speaker called on the world countries to take serious 
action vis-a-vis such crimes. 
  Stressing Iran's determination to maintain security and 
stability in the Persian Gulf region, Nuri said that the U.S. 
presence in the Persian Gulf is a threat to the security of the 
region. 
  Qian in reply said that Iran served as a bridge between Asia 
and Europe, and termed Iran's role in the strategic and 
sensitive region of the Persian Gulf as "positive and 
constructive". He also said expansion of the mutual 
parliamentary relations would strengthen the two countries' ties 
in other areas.

  [Text] Tehran, March 6, IRNA -- Majlis Vice-Speaker 
Hojatoleslam Hassan Rowhani in a meeting with the visiting 
Chinese deputy premier and foreign minister, Qian Qichen, on 
Sunday emphasized the important role of Tehran-Beijing 
cooperation in the region. 
  He referred to the efforts of the Islamic republic of Iran 
to 
help resolve the problems in the region and said Iran has always 
been after peace and contributed to establishment of lasting 
peace in the region. 
  He also said Iran has launched mediation efforts in the 
fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia and is trying to ease 
the tense situation in Afghanistan through peaceful means. 
  Rowhani expressed concern over the presence of alien forces 
in the Persian Gulf and described the movement of large warships 
in the area and dispatch of military hardware to the region as 
dangerous to regional peace. 
  Elsewhere in his remarks, he called the trend of the United 
Nations activities as worrying and said some UN decisions 
especially that of the Security Council did not conform to the 
objectives of the Council. 
  The very ineffective decisions of the Security Council on 
Somalia, on horrible crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on recent 
massacre of Muslims in Al-Khalil prayers ground in occupied 
Palestine show that the Security Council is incapable of 
carrying out its obligations, he said. 
  Rowhani said China as a giant economic power is expected to 
assume a significant role in economic development of Iran in 
light of historical bonds and the friendly relations between the 
two countries. Qian in response said that relations between 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and China have been based on mutual 
respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. 
He called for promotion of Tehran-Beijing ties. 
  He confirmed that some committees of the United Nations have 
become tools in the hands of Western governments. He referred 
to the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Committee 
and called it unjust becuase, he said, the committee is 
scrutinizing the status of human rights in most countries but it 
does not raise the issue of human rights in the United States. 
  He referred to close cooperation of Iran and China in the 
United Nations Human Rights Committee and emphasized that the 
cooperation should expand in the area. 
  He said that China was ready to play an active role in 
Iran's 
development plans and implement different plans including its 
nuclear power plant, building wagons for subway trains, cement 
plants and manufacturing military equipments.

<F P=106> [Friday Arabic sermon by Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah </F>
'Ali Khamene'i at Tehran University on 4 March--recorded] 
  [Text] Believers everywhere: May God's peace, mercy, and 
blessings be with you. The advent of the blessed night of the 
Koran's revelation, a night better than a thousand months, 
represents an opportunity for the Muslim to purify his soul and 
educate his spirit, lifting it, via his supplications and 
prayers to God, from the swamp of materialism to the realm of 
light and meaning. It is a success that I wish you will all 
have, brothers and sisters. 
  All vicious hands are seeking to drag humanity toward 
corruption and materialism. The Muslims must guard themselves 
against being dragged into this overwhelming flood through piety 
and seeking God's protection. They must erect the Islamic 
nation's structure on a solid foundation of souls strengthened 
by the repetition of God's name and a will reassured of the 
fulfillment of the divine promise, especially as we mark the 
martyrdom anniversary of the lord of the pious and prince of the 
faithful 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib, may God's peace be with him. Let 
us therefore turn this great man's saga into a beacon lighting 
our way. 
  The basic issue in our Islamic world today is the painful, 
bloody incident at the venerated Ibrahimi Mosque where fasting 
worshippers were massacred en masse by the hand of international 
Zionism. The massacre cloaked this month of fasting with the 
garb of sorrow and overwhelmed Muslim hearts with anguish and 
distress. The media of global arrogance and their stooges are 
strenuously and cunningly seeking to impose a blackout on this 
news and downplay its heinous character. But its grave 
implications are clear to everyone who has an enlightened heart. 
  I find it necessary to present the following points to our 
brothers and sisters: 
  First, those who perpetrated this incident are not a small 
group. No, everything indicates that the incident occurred after 
careful planning, preparation, and support from those who 
usurped Palestine. The Israeli Government is the criminal and 
its accomplices are those who have been giving it backing, thus 
encouraging it to dare to carry out this act. The unconditional 
U.S. backing for Israel, particularly at the recent humiliating 
negotiations, provided a safe climate for the Israeli Government 
to perpetrate this crime. The other accomplices are all those 
writers, politicians, and media personnel who beat the drums and 
did their utmost to undermine the Islamic ranks who are 
struggling against usurper Zionism and to transform the conflict 
into a conflict between two wings of our nation. They did this 
in line with U.S.-Israeli wishes. 
  Second, this incident marks the beginning of a new stage in 
the progress of Zionist policy. It will not be the last 
incident; the Zionists are still pursuing the policy they 
adopted soon after the occupation, which aims to produce 
stifling and insecure conditions for the Muslims. On the 
threshold of this unjust solution to the cause, they seek to 
prevent something called the Palestinian people from continuing 
to exist in the usurped territories. They have succeeded in 
turning the Palestinian people into a minority on their land. 
They are seeking to weaken them more and terrify their ranks so 
that the Palestinian cause can be handed over to oblivion and 
loss. It is the usurpers' beautiful dream and naive 
imagination. This incident is proof of their self-deceiving 
imagination. 
  Third, this incident teaches all the Palestinians, Arabs, 
and 
Muslims the lesson that the usurpers of Palestine are continuing 
their policy of assassination, terror, and deception. Polite 
talk with them, compromise, and so-called peaceful solutions 
will be to no avail. Had this incident occurred during the 
armed fedayeen struggle carried out by Palestinian groups, it 
could have been described as a retaliation. But its occurrence, 
after those individuals who profess to be Palestinians signed, 
with dirty and trembling hand, a document selling off Palestine, 
demonstrates the inveterately hostile, uncompromising, and 
usurping nature of Zionism. 
  Fourth, the zealous and heroic Palestinian people must, as 
a consequence, decide their own future and not leave it for the 
enemy to decide. The United States, Israel, and the corrupt 
regimes who are U.S. puppets will not adopt a humanitarian 
decision that honors the Palestinians. Those who opted for 
negotiations think only of keeping their seats of power for a 
few more days. They are heedless of the people who are wronged 
and oppressed in their own country. Their youths are killed, 
their women dishonored, their homes turned into graves, and 
their mosques, worship, and prayers are transformed into 
massacres. The Palestinians are Muslims and must therefore draw 
inspiration from their great Koran, which says: "And why should 
ye not fight in the cause of God and the cause of those who, 
being weak, are ill-treated and oppressed, men, women and 
children." [Koranic verse] 
  The Koran also describes the enemies of God: "In a believer 
they respect not the ties of kinship or of covenant. It is they 
who have transgressed all bounds." [Koranic verse] 
  Jihad is a difficult endeavor that needs endurance but it 
pleases God almighty, shatters the chains of bondage and 
humiliation, and guarantees an ideal future. Palestine has no 
security even in its own territory. Its life without struggle 
is not easier than a life of struggle. 
  No right is greater than God's words: "And if any strive, 
they do so for their own souls, for God is free of all needs 
from all creation." [Koranic verse] 
  I ask the exalted to bestow enlightenment and vigilance on 
the Islamic nations so that they can fulfill their duty to the 
Palestinian cause, especially as this issue has become more 
bitter and more afflicted. 
  International Jerusalem Day next week is drawing near. It is 
the arena in which the will of the Muslim masses becomes evident 
and is an opportunity that expresses Islamic maturity. Let us 
all appreciate this opportunity and raise our voices on that day 
in the face of the usurpers of Palestine and all those who back 
them. 
  In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  "When comes the help of God, and victory, and thou dost see 
the people enter God's religion in crowds, celebrate the praises 
of thy Lord and pray for his forgiveness, for he is 
oft-returning in grace and mercy." [Koranic verse]

<F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, in Tehran on 4 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the Merciful, the 
Compassionate. [passage omitted] 
  The issue of the Zionist enemy's aggression against the 
immaculate shrine of Abraham is such a great atrocity and it is 
such a painful incident that saying a few words does not do it 
justice. We believe that the usurper government of Israel is 
directly responsible for the Hebron massacre. The supporters of 
the usurper government, headed by America, are also responsible 
for this incident, because they always defended the Zionists 
during all those years. Whenever there was a problem for the 
Zionists, immediately America rushed to their defense. Those 
American Jews, those big capitalists, did whatever they wanted 
using American power and money and used America's political 
influence all over the world to support that cancerous cell 
which has been created in the heart of the Islamic nations. 
  Very well, are they not guilty in this case? Are they not 
responsible? No doubt they are. Also responsible in this 
incident are other allies and supporters of Israel. The world 
public media that have not justly explained that incident are 
also responsible. Human rights organizations, UN Human Rights 
Committee and other small and large organizations -- which 
operate all over the world under different titles -- are lying 
in ambush, waiting for small incidents to happen for any 
government in any corner of the globe that has no friendly ties 
with America, so that they could scream about violations of 
human rights. Now look at this case, the usurper, malicious and 
tyrannical government of the Zionists, who are the enemies of 
humanity, shed the blood of hundreds of Palestinians when they 
are fasting and prostrate in prayers. They kill tens of 
persons, injure hundreds, and later, when people who are 
naturally angry, bereaved, and sympathetic come to streets with 
their fists clenched, then Israeli soldiers target them one by 
one, hunting them and killing them. Here those organizations 
proclaiming to be defenders of human rights are keeping their 
mouths shut and say nothing. 
  At best, such and such international organization set out to 
condemn it. What good is a word of condemnation to Palestinians 
anyway? If organizations which claim to be championing human 
rights were genuine, then they should have all stood up, raised 
a cry, and imposed a blockage on the Israeli Government. They 
should have issued an ultimatum to Israel's backers and warned 
them that they had no right to help a corrupt, bloodthirsty, and 
criminal regime. However, none of this was done. 
  The Arab governments too were unfortunately complacent. They 
neither declared mourning nor set out to grieve and cover 
everywhere in black cloth [sentence as heard]. Moreover, they 
made no efforts to put a complete stop to the ongoing 
negotiations. They were at fault for their complacency. Of 
course, the conscience of the Islamic ummah became aroused and 
turbulent. 
  The Western press, however, were more at fault than any one 
else. As far as the Israeli press and media were concerned, 
they said what was exactly expected of them. They were 
murderers themselves, so how could one expect a murderer to 
condemn himself? However, why did the press in the so-called 
free world indulge in overlooking the truth to such a degree and 
remain silent or at best portray the whole thing as an 
insignificant incident? However, when an Arab took up arms and 
attacked a few people -- an attack which as far as I know did 
not lead to a great deal of damage -- the American press created 
such a hue and cry during the recent days. As far as I was 
informed, the whole of the press reports were saturated with the 
news of that incident. Nonetheless, they chose to be silent 
toward the Hebron incident, or at best decided to belittle the 
whole issue. The Western press, alternatively, set out to 
portray the incident as a provoked act committed by a single 
individual. These all constitute a great injustice. How 
fanatic, ruthless, and devoid of a free spirit -- to which they 
lay claim -- the employees of the Western press must be to react 
to the incident in such an unacceptable manner? 
  Our dear nation has of course always declared its stances. 
Let us not say --and I ask the others not to say -- what is the 
use of this anyway? The heaviest burden on the shoulder of the 
usurpers is the uprising of nations in any part of the globe. 
If nations rise, stage demonstrations in their respective 
countries, and display their clenched fists, then the criminals 
will feel trapped. This applies to all issues and processes, 
such as anti-Americanism or protest against the bloodthirsty 
elements in former Yugoslavia. 
  The peoples of the world must announce their presence on the 
political scene. That is very effective in the international 
climate of world politics. Let them not overlook this. 
Therefore, when Jerusalem Day [11 March] comes, if the world of 
Islam, God willing, honors that day with its true meaning, if it 
honors next Friday to shout at the usurper Zionists, the enemy 
will be defeated and forced to retreat. And you the people of 
Iran will, God willing, demonstrate the meaning of using 
Jerusalem Day as an opportunity to declare your stand on the 
issue of Palestine. 
  Next Friday is Jerusalem Day. Thank God, the Iranian nation 
has behaved well in that respect, and so have the government and 
the foreign ministry. They did not waste any time; they said 
what needed to be said. The oppressed Palestinians realized 
that there are people around the world who are concerned about 
their issue. 
  That concern must be proved. Pressure on Israel should be 
increased. The Palestinians, themselves, should take on the 
responsibility of reviving the issue of Palestine and fight. 
Struggle is hard, but a life like that is harder than the 
struggle. The difference is that if they fight the future would 
be good for them, but living like that would bring more hardship 
for them every day. 
  Of course, the people in occupied Palestine are awake today. 
But the struggle inside Palestine should be general and 
all-embracing and continual and connected to the outside world 
and connected to the heart of the Muslim ummah. And Muslim 
nations should help them. 
  About this issue I would like to talk to our Muslim brothers 
overseas, so I will say a few words. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Revenge Is the Only Option"] </F>
  [Text] As usual with every crime that the Zionists 
perpetrate against Muslims inside and outside the occupied 
territories, official statements have been issued full of the 
usual rhetoric and the media has overflowed with denunciations 
and condemnations. Official authorities hastened to contain the 
popular reaction and called for self-restraint and responsible 
behavior. Popular reaction was far ahead of the authorities. 
The masses have maintained sincere feelings and a sound 
awareness for 42 years. Whenever the Jews have dealt their 
barbaric blows to Muslims, the main preoccupation of the 
governments has not been to react to these attacks but to 
contain the mass anger and control public unrest. 
  This continued until the regimes' policies overcame the 
reaction of the man in the street. The majority of the people 
thus began to pay scant attention to the violation of the 
nation's dignity and the desecration of its sacred places. Many 
of the older generation who are suffering from repression and 
pain yearn for the 1950's, when popular awareness was boiling 
from the Gulf to the ocean and the streets were erupting with 
demonstrations. These were the people's recourse for their 
political impotence and a necessary venting of their emotions 
over the wounds to their dignity and their defeat. 
  But regrettably, yesterday's vigor no longer exists. Many of 
the patriotic and national forces have retreated and lost their 
zeal. Only the Islamic forces have remained in the arena, and 
they are being pursued and attacked by the authorities and 
cursed by the international forces, which accuse them of 
terrorism and of being opposed to peace. 
  The extent of the anger that cannot be kept pent up is 
evinced by the extent of the official organs' efforts to 
consolidate the defeat and present a fait accompli. This was 
clearly shown in everyone's desire to continue the peace process 
and their calls to protect it from collapse. 
  The al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is the bloody fruit of a 
peace resulting from a defeatist and capitulationist mentality. 
What peace is this they are talking about and what is its 
philosophy if its price is more killings, destruction, 
massacres, and violations of Palestinian human rights? 
  How can there be coexistence when the Jews are acting 
according to the Talmud, which advocates the annihilation of the 
Muslims and legitimizes the shedding of their blood? 
  The Zionist concept of peace is the peace of the Jews and 
their security, not peace for the Palestinians and their 
recovery of their lands. What the international and regional 
capitals are saying about peace is only a trick to defuse 
popular anger and to calm the hearts that have been shaken by 
this barbaric crime. 
  The hurried U.S. call for the resumption of the peace talks 
in Washington and everyone's eagerness to blame the incident on 
sick madmen suffering from psychological complexes are only 
designed to justify the logic of the false peace, while 
asserting that this peace will solve our problems, make everyone 
happy, and restore normality. 
  But this crime indicates something completely different. Its 
planners chose to carry it out in a sacred place and at a holy 
time in a clear indication of the essence and core of the 
conflict. It is a conflict between two systems and 
civilizations, one divine and the other earthly, one that 
embodies harmony with what God wants and the other hostile to 
God and propagating discrimination and the inequality of peoples. 
  The Zionist Jews' concept of security demands nothing less 
than the exclusion and annihilation of the Muslim Palestinians 
and depriving them of the right to life and to their land. 
Hence, the logic of confrontation must take account of the real 
Zionist objectives. No understanding can be reached with a 
criminal enemy through the logic of the defeated peace. Real, 
practical action that deprives the Zionists of their security 
and safety is the only possible reply that can restore a balance 
to the conflict formula. 
  Indifference, laxity, and dependence on negotiations will 
not 
restore wasted dignity or lost rights. The blood of innocent 
Palestinians shed in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is merely the price 
for the ostrich policy that is pursued in the region in regard 
to the criminal enemy. If Muslims were in the habit of 
returning blow for blow, the Zionists would not have been so 
confident that they could commit their crimes so easily. There 
is only one logic that the nation should follow undeviatingly in 
its struggle with the enemies: namely, the logic of 
steadfastness, resistance, and escalation of the confrontation, 
not withdrawal and retreat. Retreat has always paved the way 
for the enemies to commit more crimes. The Muslims have had 
enough retreats and humiliation and everyone should now shout 
for revenge. Let the secularists and pragmatists stop offering 
their advice and logic, which have only compounded the nation's 
humiliation and degradation.

<F P=106> ["Today's Halt" column by Walid Ibrahim] </F>
  [Text] The senseless atrocity committed by the Zionists in 
the Ibrahimi mosque generates a mixed sentiment of terror and 
bewilderment. What can one say? Yesterday afternoon, when I 
came to the office to discuss a topic for "Today's Halt" column, 
the editor suggested I should write about the carnage, but I was 
not yet over the shock. I said no and left. What kept preying 
on my mind was that the crime will be folded, rolled up like a 
carpet and consigned to a dusty corner. 
  It is expected the peace process will resume after a short 
pause. Yasir 'Arafat will return to work on the "only 
alternative" and try to fully utilize the "historic opportunity" 
furnished by the shameless Gaza-Jericho agreement. Yes, this is 
the greatest grief and ultimate humiliation. 
  'Arafat said that the crime was one that should not be 
forgotten. But it will be. They will say that the culprits are 
not connected with the Israeli Army and probably describe them 
as hysterical and mentally deranged. 
  'Arafat was publicly wondering about the position of the 
United States, as a cosponsor of the peace process. It was 
President Clinton who orchestrated the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles. 'Arafat also wants to know the 
reaction of European and nonaligned countries. 
  What if you get an answer to that, 'Arafat? What will 
change? Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the 
defunct Arab League, said that the massacre will endanger the 
peace process. The French Foreign Ministry voiced outrage. The 
White House also expressed mild indignation. The UK Government 
did not denounce the massacre but criticized the events that 
followed and expressed--is not this great, 'Arafat?--its hope 
that the massacre will not impede negotiations between the Arabs 
and Israel. The Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its 
"profound dismay" and called on--this is a good one too--the 
concerned parties to continue peace efforts. The German Foreign 
Ministry described the incident as a "bloodbath" and called 
on--what else can you ask for, 'Arafat?--the various sides not 
to allow the peace process to be derailed. The International 
Committee of the Red Cross merely expressed alarm and called for 
"respect for the rights of civilians" 
  So, everyone and his cousin have denounced the massacre in 
strong or not-so-strong terms. They also called for talks and 
the continuation of peace efforts. 
  Is this what you wanted, 'Arafat? Were you worried that, in 
the absence of condemnation, the sacred blood of the 
Palestinians would fail to change into negotiable water and dust? 
  What is degrading is that Western foreign ministries despise 
you, 'Arafat, as much as they despise Palestinians, dead or 
alive. The massacre that you yourself described as "a crime 
that should not be forgotten" will, after all, be forgotten. 
After all expressions of outrage have receded, after the call 
to get on with our lives--read: let the massacre go 
unpunished--is heeded, the process of forgetting will set in. 
  For more than 40 years, we and the rest of world have been 
denouncing and condemning the "Zionist entity," but the 
Palestinians continued getting killed and liquidated; the chorus 
of condemnation may as well have been the drone of a fly. 
  How can you confront your people with a straight face while 
Palestinian bloodshed in the Ibrahimi mosque covers you from 
head to toe? And, what about earlier Palestinian blood? Have 
you consigned that to your archives as well? 
  You, 'Arafat, more than anyone else, should see to it that 
the crime is not forgotten. The least you could do is listen to 
the advice of Fatah dissident, Munir Maqdah, who said: "In the 
past, we called on 'Arafat to step down. But now, stepping down 
is not good enough. The best thing 'Arafat can do is to commit 
suicide."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Hypocrisy," the 
newspaper TISHRIN editorial says: The world is awaiting a 
positive UN Security Council [UNSC] stand condemning the heinous 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, providing for protection of 
Palestinians under occupation, and underscoring the foundations 
of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, 
Israeli officials have been making a flood of statements, 
demanding the immediate resumption of the negotiations, as if 
the massacre did not take place, as if the settlers problem has 
been resolved, and as if there are no longer any threats to Arab 
lives. 
  TISHRIN adds: Israeli officials have leaked reports to the 
effect that they have disarmed only two settlers. We should 
remember that the population of Zionist settlers in the occupied 
territories stands at 150,000. The settlers, who are armed to 
the teeth, have not concealed their determination to persist 
with their murders, sabotage, and massacres. This shows the 
immense deception in which the Israeli officials are engaged, as 
well as the immense disregard in which they hold the 
international community. 
  The paper notes the Israeli officials' zeal for the 
resumption of their stalled talks with the Palestinians. The 
paper maintains that this reflects their fears over the future 
of the Oslo and Cairo accords. This is because the two accords 
have, practically speaking, given Israel a free hand in the 
occupied Arab territories, and consecrated fully the Zionist 
domination of affairs there. 
  The paper says: The two accords provide for security 
arrangements, as well as a redeployment of Israeli troops to 
protect settlements. By contrast, these accords have failed to 
include any provisions regarding the protection of Palestinians 
from the attacks of settlers or the Israeli Army. 
  TISHRIN believes that the Israeli demand that Syria declare 
commitment to just and comprehensive peace is a clear 
manifestation of Israeli hypocrisy. The paper reiterates that 
Syria, through President al-Asad, has repeatedly declared such a 
commitment. Moreover, Syria repeatedly saved the Washington 
talks from collapse, and made repeated calls for a true peace in 
the Middle East. However, Israel has lent deaf ears to these 
calls. It has done all it can to blackmail the Palestinians and 
push them toward a separate deal that neither realizes the 
Palestinian people's aspirations, nor meets the requirements of 
the desired peace in the region. 
  Concluding its editorial, the paper urges the UNSC, which is 
continuing its debate on the Hebron massacre, to uphold the 
principles enshrined in the UN Charter and prove the credibility 
of the world community by dotting the i's and crossing the t's 
and condemning settlement activities as a policy, approach, and 
practice. 
  In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
addresses the savage practices the Israeli occupation 
authorities are perpetrating against the Palestinians of the 
occupied Arab territories, saying: Since the Hebron massacre, 
Israel has been enforcing a military siege against the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, isolating their residents from the 
outside world. It has clamped a curfew on some 2 million 
Palestinians, and given its troops a free hand to spread fear 
and terror throughout the occupied territories. These troops 
have perpetrated murders, repression, and terrorism that are no 
less heinous or hideous than the Hebron massacre. 
  The paper adds: What has taken place, and is currently 
taking place in the occupied territories has failed to move the 
conscience of the international community. To date, no punitive 
measures or actions have been taken to make Israel halt its 
bloody repression. Nobody has asked Israel to lift the curfews, 
which have turned the lives of hundreds of thousands of people 
into an intolerable inferno due to the acute shortages of food 
and medical supplies. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The reactions to the Hebron 
massacre have been confined to useless condemnations and 
denunciations that cannot prompt the Tel Aviv rulers to halt the 
savage practices being perpetrated by their troops and settlers. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If it is really 
concerned about security and stability in the Middle East, and 
if it wants the peace process to achieve its objectives, the 
world community must urge the UNSC to adopt a firm and decisive 
resolution providing for the dismantlement of settlements in the 
occupied territories, and for protection of Palestinians. Such 
a resolution must make Israel do all that needs to be done to 
promote the cause of peace.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: While the world waited, expecting the UN 
Security Council to take a positive stand by condemning the 
brutal Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, by ensuring the protection of 
the Palestinians living under the yolk of occupation, and by 
stressing the bases of a just and comprehensive Middle East 
peace, Israeli officials made statement after statement 
demanding an immediate resumption of the negotiations, as if the 
massacre had not occurred, as if the problem of the settlers had 
been solved, and as if there were no longer a threat posed to 
Arab citizens! 
  Israeli officials leaked information alleging that they had 
disarmed just two settlers. But there are some 150,000 heavily 
armed Jewish settlers, who do not even try to conceal their 
determination to continue the murders, destruction, and 
massacres. Thus we see the true extent of the Israeli officials' 
deception and their disregard for the international community. 
  In fact, Israeli officials' eagerness to resume the 
suspended 
talks with the Palestinians is due to their fear for the Oslo 
and Cairo agreements, which have practically given Israel a free 
hand in the occupied Arab territories affairs and entrenched 
total Zionist hegemony. While both agreements stipulate 
security arrangements and an Israeli military deployment, they 
do not, in return, include any arrangement for the protection of 
the Palestinian people from attacks by the settlers and the 
Israeli Army. 
  Israeli officials are also concerned over the growth of the 
Palestinian intifadah throughout the occupied territories. This 
threatens both agreements with collapse and sheds light on the 
main problem represented by occupation, settlement, and Israel's 
refusal to apply Security Council resolutions organizing the 
peace process. By trying to revive the negotiations, the Israeli 
officials want to deceive the international community and to 
prevent the Security Council from passing a resolution stressing 
the bases of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
condemning the settlement policy, calling for the dismantling of 
the settlements, and providing protection for the Palestinian 
people. 
  Israel's calls for peace do not stand up to any test. It is 
Israel that occupies the Arab territories, refuses to withdraw 
from them, commits crimes, instigates the settlers to commit 
massacres, arms and finances settlers, and prevents the 
Washington talks from advancing a single step. Over two years 
of talks, the Arab delegations have heard nothing other than 
Israeli security pretexts and conditions, while Arabs in the 
West Bank, Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon fell victims. It is 
the Arab side that certainly needs security guarantees. The 
terrible Hebron massacre exposed Israel's hypocrisy and 
allegations, which are aimed at preventing the application of 
the Security Council's resolutions and the return of the 
occupied territories to their rightful owners. 
  Israel's call on Syria to declare its commitment to 
achieving 
a just and comprehensive peace gives a clear idea of Israel's 
hypocrisy. Syria has announced such a commitment hundreds of 
times through President al-Asad, it has repeatedly saved the 
Washington talks from collapse, and it has called for true peace 
in the Middle East that can survive in the face of events and 
variables. But Israel lent a deaf ear to these calls and 
focused all its efforts on how to blackmail the Palestinian side 
and to push it into a unilateral settlement that does not meet 
the aspirations of the Palestinian people and the requirements 
of the desired peace in the region. How quickly the snow melted 
and Israel's peace concepts were exposed! Israel wants to kill 
the Palestinian people by raking them with machine guns and 
rockets, all under the pretext of security allegations. 
  The Security Council, which is continuing its consultations 
on the Hebron massacre, must live up to the principles of the 
United Nations and the credibility of the international 
community in order to clarify matters, to condemn the settlement 
process in terms of politics and application, and to clearly 
call for Israel's total withdrawal as a basic conditions for a 
stable peace in the Middle East.

  [Text] In its editorial today under the headline "Israeli 
Lies," TISHRIN speaks about claims of U.S. Jewish organizations 
about the living conditions of Jews in Syria. 
  The paper says these claims are part of a systematic 
campaign 
to create confusion and cast doubt on Syria and its positions 
that call for achieving a just and comprehensive peace, as well 
as putting an end to Israeli attempts to blow up the peace 
process. 
  TISHRIN asserts that when Israel raises doubts about the 
situation of Jews in Syria, it knows well that it will only reap 
failure and will not be able to exonerate itself of the crimes 
it is committing in broad daylight against Arab citizens and 
holy shrines. 
  Noting the massacres Israel itself has committed against 
Jews 
to drive them to emigrate to Palestine, the paper says: We 
recall these official practices only to assert that Israel and 
its terrorist and extremist organizations seek --by propagating 
their illusions that Syrian Jews are in danger -- to distract 
attention from the denunciation and condemnation of what it did 
at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. The 
whole world regards the unbelievable Israeli aggression against 
the Palestinian people in the occupied territories with anger, 
rage, and suspicion. 
  The paper adds: The world, and the Jews of Syria, have 
acknowledged that they are living in their homeland and enjoying 
full peace and security. Israel has no right to fabricate lies 
and launch claims and falsehoods about the status of Jews in 
Syria, because they form an indivisible part of the Syrian 
people and enjoy, without discrimination, all rights of 
citizenship to travel, movement, ownership, responsibilities, 
work, and residence. The Jews of Syria are in no need of 
misleading Israeli claims. They have said that they do not 
accept any substitute for their homeland, Syria, and they are 
capable of producing evidence to reply to Israeli lies. 
  The paper concludes: Israel should be the first party to 
acknowledge that it entertains illusions about what is it 
saying. The result will be similar to cultivating the sea. Its 
lies, no matter how skillfully fabricated, can fool no one. 
Israel is facing the results of its own terrorism and is held 
responsible for its crimes and massacres.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In two articles, AL-THAWRAH speaks about the 
dimensions of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its impact on the 
Middle East peace process. 
  The first article, under the headline "Settlers, A Major 
Pillar of Occupation," talks about the dangers Israeli 
settlement activity poses to the peace process and the 
impossibility of achieving peace under this settlement activity, 
which is a form of occupation. 
  AL-THAWRAH asserts that contrary to the expectations of 
Israeli rulers, the monstrosity of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
has revealed to the whole world that the complex of racism 
controls Zionists, particularly the settlers. The massacre 
revealed the extent of their black rancor against Arabs, to the 
point of physical liquidation. Those people do not care about 
the negative -- in fact destructive -- impact this will have on 
the peace process, on which the world community pins great hopes 
of achieving a just and comprehensive peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH says such a peace cannot be established before 
the 
Israeli occupiers and the Zionist settlers leave the occupied 
territories. Let the settlers be the first to do this. 
  The paper adds: If the international community wants the 
bilateral peace talks to resume, then appropriate resolutions 
should be issued to provide international protection for 
Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, to disarm the 
settlers, and to deploy international observers as a prelude to 
dismantling the Zionist settlements. 
  In the second article, under the headline "Incapable 
Security 
Council", the paper speaks about another aspect of this issue. 
It explains that the Security Council's slowness in issuing an 
appropriate resolution regarding Israel's responsibility for the 
massacre and the situation in the occupied territories has 
exacerbated matters and encouraged the Yitzhaq Rabin government 
to go further in its measures to kill Palestinians and impose a 
tight military siege and curfew following the massacre. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Rabin has shown an extreme disregard by not 
ruling out a repeat of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre elsewhere in 
the occupied territories. He wants to threaten the Palestinians 
with new massacres and takes lightly the Security Council. 
  The paper says Arabs have a fair and necessary demand before 
the Security Council. They want the Security Council resolution 
to refer to an international deployment to ensure the security 
of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories, including 
the city of Jerusalem as part of the 1967-occupied territories. 
  The paper adds: Israeli policy, which is drowning in 
terrorism, aims at depriving Washington of any peaceful 
achievement, as long as the United States does not intervene and 
only asks the parties concerned with the peace process to reach 
solutions, and avoids applying pressure. 
  The paper concludes: Israel does not really want peace. The 
evidence is the obstruction of the peace talks, the increase of 
Israeli crimes, and the continuing construction of settlements 
and the occupation of Arab territories. Peace does not coexist 
with occupation.

<F P=106> [Statement by Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid following meeting with the ambassadors of the 15 
member-states of the UN Security Council in Cairo on 6 
March--recorded] 
  [Text] I have expressed my dismay and sorrow at the 
Security Council's delay in adopting a resolution about the 
terrible Hebron massacre even though 10 days have already passed 
since the incident. This is politically and morally 
unacceptable. We hope that the Security Council will hasten to 
issue a resolution implementing the rules of the Fourth Geneva 
Convention in order to provide international protection for the 
Palestinians, disarm the settlers, and dismantle the 
settlements. We believe that this massacre has had a profound 
effect on the peace process. We wish to preserve the peace 
process. If you look at paragraph six of the resolution before 
you, it says that the two countries sponsoring the peace 
conference will urge earnest action to ensure the success of the 
peace efforts by halting Israeli procrastination. Regrettably, 
Israel's procrastination has gone on too long and is 
intolerable. Therefore, it is necessary to point out how 
dangerous this procrastination is. Doubtlessly, the whole world 
welcomed the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 
13 September 1993. The Arab League regarded it as an important 
step on the path to peace, but we later heard Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin say that some of the deadlines in the declaration 
are not sacred. Of course, you have heard these remarks. The 
first step in the agreement should have been implemented on 13 
December; now we are approaching the 13 April deadline, the date 
set for the troops' evacuation and the establishment of 
autonomy. Will anything be implemented on this date or is 13 
April also not a sacred date? If nothing is sacred why is it 
mentioned in the agreement? I am surprised at this. There is no 
need to specify dates if we are then going to say they are not 
sacred. 
  Of course, I drew attention to this point today. I asked the 
ambassadors and envoys of the 15 Security Council members to 
inform their governments of all this. I believe they will do so 
today in view of the fact that the Security Council is due to 
meet again on Monday morning. We still have ample time for 
contacts because of the six or seven-hour time difference 
between Cairo and New York. Over there they have not yet woke up 
today. This gives us enough time to make contacts and enable 
the envoys to call up their capitals, who can contact UN 
headquarters. We hope that when this happens a resolution will 
be adopted very quickly.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi received U.S. Ambassador 
to Lebanon Mark Hambley at B'abda Palace this morning. They 
discussed the massacre at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
Micha'il, developments in Lebanon, and the suspension of the 
bilateral talks following the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron. Hambley handed President al-Hirawi a message from 
U.S. President Bill Clinton expressing the feelings of the 
American people and their strong support for Lebanon in foiling 
the attempts of those who are trying to infringe upon its 
independence. 
  After the meeting with President al-Hirawi, Hambley said 
that 
the visit was intended to express condemnation of the carnage at 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which caused the death of innocent 
people. He reiterated his country's support for the peace 
process and its emphasis on continuing these steps toward peace. 
He noted that President Clinton had stressed his support for 
President al-Hirawi and, through him, to the other Lebanese 
leaders and people. 
  Responding to a question on continuing the talks after their 
suspension in the wake of the Hebron massacre, Hambley said that 
his country is trying to find a suitable atmosphere for a 
resumption of the talks and the peace process in the region. He 
noted that his country is contacting all parties and expects the 
parties to resume talks in Washington soon.

  [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has announced that it 
is unfair to claim that security is deficient despite the 
existence of many security agencies in the country. 
  In an interview carried on Radio Free Lebanon's "Dialogue 
With an Official" program, Dallul stated: We must not forget 
that these agencies were very recently an object of admiration 
and appreciation by all citizens and officials. We must have 
confidence in the security agencies and give them a chance to 
uncover the perpetrators of the crime. It is still premature to 
say that they have failed. 
  Regarding coordination among these security agencies, Dallul 
admitted there is a flaw in this respect, which he ascribed to 
the statutes by which they were established which ignore the 
issue of operational coordination among all these departments. 
  He added: Of course, the Central Security Council meets 
regularly under the chairmanship of the interior minister, but 
perhaps we should have more practical and effective coordination. 
  Dallul said it might be possible to give some good news to 
the citizens to offset some of the sorrow that they have 
suffered since the church bombing in al-Zuq. He said he has the 
impression that there will be some results very soon, noting 
that the citizens, officials, and media must support the 
security agencies and disregard any aspersions against them at 
this particular time. 
  Regarding reports of the arrest of some women who allegedly 
carried out the bombing, Dallul said this is a lie told at the 
expense of the security agencies and is not the work of any 
agency seeking to discredit another. 
  He added: They exploited an individual working in a certain 
media institution who also serves the interests of a certain 
group and disseminated this report through him. The report aims 
to confuse the entire investigation. The authorities 
immediately arrested this person and interrogated him. 
  Dallul said that everyone who has been interrogated has been 
treated as a witness with possible useful information, not 
interrogated as a suspect.

  [Text] Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman 
of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has renewed his accusation 
that Israel engineered the massacre at Sayyidat al-Najat Church. 
He stressed that this is a type of crime that only Israel 
commits. He did not rule out the possibility that the 
perpetrators may be Lebanese Christians, Maronites, or Muslims, 
adding: We exonerate no one; the crime happened and its 
perpetrators are at large in our society. And Israel has tools 
and agents in Lebanon. He went on to call on the government to 
uncover the criminals because we want to learn the identity of 
these tools of Israel. 
  Grand Ja'farite Mufti Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan has said 
that the total condemnation of the Sayyidat al-Najah Church 
crime has fortified Lebanon anew, enhanced the Lebanese people's 
vigilance and cohesion, and consolidated their national unity.

that the perpetrators of the Zuq Mikha'il church massacre be 
tracked down because this crime is not a Christian or Muslim 
problem. It is a Lebanese-Arab problem. Fadlallah believes 
that this is a crucial stage and that the situation in the 
region will be moving toward further mix up. He affirmed that 
any shake-up in the Arab reality will have echoes in Lebanon.

  [Text] Beirut, Feb 25 (AFP)--The head of a former Lebanese 
Christian militia was sentenced in absentia to seven years of 
hard labour by a military court here for allegedly collaborating 
with Israel, a court source said on Friday [25 February]. 
  Etienne Saqr was accused of "collaborating with the Israeli 
enemy," the source said. 
  One of his aides, Samir Philippe Nasr, who has been jailed 
for the past six months, was also sentenced to two years of hard 
labour on the same charges. 
  Saqr, who headed the Guardians of the Cedars militia, was 
accused of having told Nasr to ask renegade army general Michel 
'Awn to cooperate with "Zionist circles" and the Jewish lobby in 
the United States. 
  'Awn, who lives in exile in France, turned down the request, 
according to the military prosecutor's findings. 
  Saqr denied the charges against him in November, but said he 
was in favour of establishing good relations with Israel. 
  Since 1989, Saqr has lived in his home village of Sabbah, in 
the Jazin district of south Lebanon, an area controlled by 
Israel's proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army (SLA). 
  The Lebanese authorities have cracked down on several people 
alleged to have supported normal ties with Israel, including 
Miss Lebanon Ghada Turk, accused of deliberately posing with 
Miss Israel at an international beauty contest in Johannesburg 
late last year.

  [Text] The Hebron massacre has rekindled the old-new 
competition between Jordan and the PLO over the legitimate 
representation of Palestinians inside the occupied territories. 
  Since the early moments of the massacre, Jordan -- king and 
government -- acted in a manner showing that it is the major 
party concerned with this affairs. The language used by King 
Husayn indicated that he is the person most directly concerned 
with what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque. The Royal Court thus 
declared a three-day mourning period and his majesty donated 
100,000 dinars to the victims of the massacre. The king also 
immediately instructed the Jordanian delegation in Washington to 
inform the U.S. Administration of the suspension of the 
negotiations -- without consulting the PLO. His majesty also 
received appeals from Hebron residents asking him to come to 
their rescue. These appeals are a political yardstick showing 
that Jordan is the party to which the people inside the 
territories turn in times of hardship. 
  The Jordanian Government, led by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, 
has translated the political significance of the steps taken by 
King Husayn into concrete action. It has asserted, through a 
show of mourning and by sponsoring licensed demonstrations and 
marches, that it was deeply affected by what happened in Hebron. 
For the first time in its history, the Jordanian Government has 
been the leader in a state of "protest" against what is 
happening inside the occupied territories. 
  These "panoramic" steps raised controversy among Palestinian 
community leaders. Some observers even went as far as to say 
that Jordan has reopened the traditional competition between 
Amman and the PLO over Palestinian representation. This war of 
representation did not end with the decision issued by the 1974 
Rabat summit, which asserted that the PLO is the sole, 
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. On many 
occasions, King Husayn voiced reservations about this decision 
when it has not facilitated the mission of the Palestinians to 
acquire their legitimate rights as the Arabs had thought.

  [Excerpts] Many questions still surround the news of a 
secret visit to France for medical treatment by Staff Lieutenant 
General Husayn Kamil Hasan al-Majid, Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn's adviser. Word of the visit, carried by an opposition 
radio in northern Iraq, has set off a political crisis within 
the French Government. The Iraqi opposition radio said Lt. Gen. 
al-Majid obtained an entry visa to France under an assumed name 
and on a Jordanian diplomatic passport, along with his 
secretary, Khalid al-Makhzumi, and his wife, who is Saddam's 
daughter. 
  Al-Majid had been hospitalized at the King Husayn Medical 
Center, where he underwent surgery to remove a brain tumor that 
turned out to be benign. [passage omitted] 
  The question remains, however, whether Jordan really made 
Jordanian passports available to the Iraqis. Jordan's Interior 
Minister Salamah Hammad, in a statement to SHIHAN, has 
disclaimed any knowledge of the passport issue, and stressed 
that his ministry has not issued passports to any Iraqis.

  [Text] Amman--Officials, Iraqi sources and travellers 
Sunday [6 March] said the Iraqi government had tightened 
existing rules as well as imposing fresh measures against 
smuggling across the border to Jordan in a bid to check the 
seepage of goods from Iraq, which is under a sweeping 
international embargo. 
  Particular attention is given to checking foreign currency 
and electronic and electrical goods at the Iraqi crossing point 
into Jordan at Tirbil in the wake of a dramatic plunge in the 
value of the Iraqi dinar since early this year, they said. 
  In many cases vehicles carrying diplomatic plates are also 
searched thoroughly before being allowed out, they said. 
  Iraqi nationals carrying foreign currency with them into the 
country also face similar problems, they said. 
  "There does not appear to be any hard and fast rule for the 
amount of foreign currency one could carry while he or she goes 
in," said an Iraqi source. "Sometimes even small amounts are 
seized from travellers." 
  "On the other hand, many businessmen appear not to have any 
serious problems," added the source. 
  Beyond that, however, are stricter measures aimed at 
preventing imported products leaving Iraq territory, the sources 
said. 
  "Every piece of baggage is checked very throughly and 
anything that raises doubts that it could be used for commercial 
purposes is confiscated at the border poknt before the traveller 
leaves Iraq," said an Iraqi source. 
  A traveller reported that two of three Irqi-made leather 
jackets he was carrying were seized at the border. "They said 
they could permit only one for personal use," the traveller told 
the JORDAN TIMES. 
  In another case, a foreign journalist who had carried with 
him extra lenses and other camera accessories on an assignment 
in Iraq reported that he was not allowed to take them out. 
  "I had registered my cameras when I went in, but did not 
bother to do so with the lenses and some other accessories," 
said the photographer. "On my way out, they said I could carry 
only the cameras and confiscated the lenses and accessories, 
saying I could not prove I had taken them with me when I went 
in. Intervention by Iraqi officials in Baghdad did not help 
either." 
  According to experts on Iraqi economy and the government 
approaches to imports and exports, Baghdad appeared to be 
concerned that it would have to spend massive amounts in foreign 
exchange for imports to meet local demands as and when the 
sanctions are lifted. And, as such, It wants to retrain whatever 
remains in the country, they said. 
  Border officials on the Jordanian side said they were 
finding 
fewer cases of smuggling and fewer items that are subject to 
Jordanian customs regulations in travellers baggage. 
  "We used to find many travellers, both Iraqis and others, 
carrying foreign-made cameras, watches, perfumes, electronic 
equipment, etc., and most of the time levy customs on them," 
said an official. "These days the flow of such items seems to 
have dried up." 
  According to Iraqi sources, the Baghdad government wants to 
check people trying to take out electronic and electric goods 
that the country imported prior to the imposition of the 
sanctions in August 1990. 
  A massive quantity of such products also ended up in the 
Iraqi market from Kuwait which remained under Iraqi occupation 
between August 1990 and March 1991. 
  The Iraqi source noted that Iraqi rules in force for many 
years prevent the outflow of goods imported into Iraq without 
prior government permission, but that the regulations were 
enforced with relative laxity until recently. 
  "Now, the rules are enforced to the letter," said the 
source. 
"Only those with wasta (connection with influential officials) 
are an exception."

<F P=106> [By Nirmin Murad, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] A total of 33 Iranian diplomats have slipped out of 
the country quietly in compliance with a Jordanian request that 
Tehran reduce its diplomatic representation here to a number 
compatible with Amman's presence in the Iranian capital. 
  As part of the agreement between Amman and Tehran, the last 
of the 33 diplomats left at the end of February and the 
previously bustling embassy, according to the secretary general 
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been reduced to four 
diplomats, including the ambassador, four administrators, a 
driver and cook. 
  Nayef Hadid told the JORDAN TIMES that the Kingdom believed 
it was necessary to request the reduction because the number of 
Iranian diplomats in Jordan was not compatible with Amman's two 
diplomats in Tehran. 
  In the first on-the-record confirmation of the Jordanian 
request, Mr. Hadid said that he first approached the Iranian 
ambassador here about reducting his diplomatic staff in November 
last year. 
  "Ten days later, Iranian guards shot at our embassy in 
Tehran 
injuring a security man," Mr Hadid said. The shooting incident 
was not reported in Jordan. 
  Officials, however, had said that Jordanian ambassador to 
Iran Yasin Istanbuli was attacked at his home in Tehran and his 
assailants searched his house and stole some of its contents in 
August of that year. 
  It was Tehran's refusal to apologise officially over the 
mistreatment of the Jordanian ambassador that initially made the 
Jordanian government ask for the reduction. 
  Sources had said that Mr. Istanbuli was tied up for several 
hours while his assailants searched his house and stole some of 
its contents. 
  Jordanian officials at the time expressed their suspicion 
that the assailants of Mr. Istanbuli belonged to one of the 
security wings in Iran and demanded that the Iranian government 
investigate the cause. 
  The government here, according to the sources, also demanded 
an "official apology" from Tehran but only received a message 
that the Iranian government was "sorry" that the attack had 
taken place. 
  Privately, officials say that the Kingdom was becoming 
concerned over increased activities by Iranian diplomats to 
infiltrate cultural and research centres in the Kingdom and 
distribute leaflets targetting Gulf regimes. 
  Officials contacted by the JORDAN TIMES would not confirm 
these accusations but one source said that the embassy had been 
able to win support among private sector businessmen here and 
that these influential traders contacted the Foreign Ministry on 
behalf of the embassy when it first became known that they were 
being asked to reduce their staff. 
  Jordan and Iran restored diplomatic relations in 1990 after 
a 
decade of strained relations caused by Amman's support of Iraq 
in the 1980-88 war. Iran reopened its embassy in March 1990 and 
appointed the first ambassador in 13 years in October 1993.

  [Text] Amman, AL-RA'Y -- U.S. Navy vessels in the Straits 
of Tiran have continued to stop commercial vessels bound for 
al-'Aqabah. An official source at the Tawfiq Gharghur &amp; Sons 
Shipping Company told AL-RA'Y on 1 March the Maltese ship 
"Angelic" was intercepted at the Straits of Tiran by the U.S. 
Navy. The ship was coming from Eastern European ports with 2062 
tonnes of goods and dozens of containers on board. The U.S. 
Navy inspected the ship on the pretext that they could not have 
access to some packages addressed to Jakarta Port in cabin No. 
3, which contained no goods for Jordan at all. 
  This took place despite the fact that the captain and crew 
of 
the ship cooperated fully with the inspection team and proposed 
sealing the ship's cabins that contained no cargo for Jordan. 
The purpose was to allow the ship to unload the al-'Aqabah 
goods and then go back to the inspection site while the other 
cabins were still closed. The inspection officer, however, 
refused and prevented the ship from proceeding toward 
al-'Aqabah. The ship was forced to head for Suez Port to unload 
its cargo for Jordanian merchants.

Gaza-Jericho agreement can be implemented within six weeks. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Mr. Rabin made 
the remarks to an EC delegation led by the Greek foreign 
minister. The prime minister also said in the meeting that he 
would be ready to accept an international presence only in Gaza 
and Jericho after the Palestinians take over those areas. He 
also told the guests that Israel is interested in the resumption 
of the negotiations with the PLO as soon as possible, but he 
would not be prepared to reopen agreed upon accords.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with MBC, Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres called for the resumption of peace talks 
between Israel and the PLO, saying that such a move would 
benefit both sides. 
  Responding to a question on the difficulties that the Hebron 
massacre has created for the peace talks and the fact that the 
massacre brought to the fore once again the issue of 
settlements, settlers, and their restraining effect on the peace 
process, Peres said: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] "I admit that what happened 
created 
many pressures and problems for us. We have to find the 
suitable solutions. In my opinion, the most important 
development that should happen now is the implementation of the 
agreement, not its revision. I believe that the Palestinians 
and Arabs will feel a dramatic change once they are in control 
of their lives in Gaza and Jericho. Soon afterward, it will be 
possible to begin negotiating other matters. But if we scrap 
the agreement and start on a new one, we will remain suspended 
in midair for a long time and people will lose patience and 
eventually confidence in the possibility of achieving peace." 
  [Correspondent Mahir Shalabi] There is talk of a possible 
meeting between you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat 
tomorrow in Cairo. 
  [Peres] "No agreement has been made about this meeting so 
far." 
  [Shalabi] If this meeting takes place, one of the issues 
that 
will be put before you is the deployment of international forces 
in the occupied territories. 
  [Peres] "If the meeting takes place and this subject is 
brought up, I will probably have an answer." [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The call for the evacuation of Jewish settlers 
from the heart of Hebron is not new, but it now appears that the 
problem is much more wide ranging. Senior government sources 
point to over 40 settlements that the government will probably 
have no choice but to evacuate. In the meantime, it seems that 
the tendency to leave voluntarily is growing among the settlers. 
Over 1,000 settlers have so far appealed to the Construction 
and Housing Ministry to leave and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer 
admits that contrary to the law, he approved rental aid for the 
center of the country. Roni Daniyel and 'Imanu'el Rosen report: 
  [Begin recording] [Daniyel] This is the picture that says 
it all. In the heart of Hebron's casbah the white roofed houses 
belong to the Jewish settlement in the town. There are about 
400 Jews in Tall al-Rumaythah, Bet Hadasa, Bet Romano, and the 
Avraham Avinu market among 120,000 Arabs. That is what 
threatens to ignite a big fire. 
  [Ben-Eli'ezer] That obliges us and the entire public to say 
to them: Despite all the pain and sorrow we feel, you are being 
evacuated from Qiryat Arba. Period. [passage omitted] 
  The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs 
discussed the fate of those houses this week. Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer and Shulamit Aloni demanded the immediate 
evacuation of the Jews from Hebron. The prime minister listened 
but did not respond. Many ministers believe that he will order 
their evacuation, but not now, not before the Declaration of 
Principles is implemented. 'Uzi Bar'am promises to raise the 
issue at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. 
  [Bar'am] I think that only a few ministers have declared 
their opposition therefore there is still a silent group, 
including the foreign minister, and it is very important to hear 
their opinions on the matter. 
  [Rosen] What is the prime minister's stand on the Hebron 
issue, as far as you know. 
  [Bar'am] I think that the prime minister does not want to 
touch the Hebron issue because he wants to continue with the 
position that we do not evacuate settlements at this stage. I 
do not think he agrees with the settlement inside Hebron, he 
simply thinks it does not pay to concentrate all the forces on 
that issue now. 
  [Daniyel] But Hebron is only a small example of a much 
larger problem. This is Karmel which does not have Arab 
neighbors or in fact any neighbors. It is a Jewish settlement, 
30 families, on the slopes of the Hebron Hills, with a narrow 
road and almost no traffic, a clear example of an isolated 
settlement. [passage omitted] 
  Karmel is also only one example. The government ministries 
and the defense establishment have already prepared the lists. 
Over 40 settlements are defined as isolated settlements in the 
heart of Arab areas. Put another way, it is Netzarim repeated 
40 times. When autonomy is implemented, approaches to each of 
these settlements, for example Psagot, will become a military 
operation. [passage omitted] 
  [Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur] I believe we will 
want to set up coherent blocs of as many settlements as 
possible. We will have to find solutions for isolated 
settlements. I already know this will not be easy. Travel to 
them is very unpleasant, they pass through or nearby Arab 
villages. Topographically, it is very easy to set up ambushes 
there. 
  [Rosen] Not for attribution, we were told that the General 
Staff, the government, and the prime minister believe that the 
future of these settlements, or at least these, will be decided 
on in the near future, long before the permanent arrangement is 
discussed. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 
GMT on 4 March reports that "today's Ramadan prayers on Temple 
Mount were held in a perfectly orderly fashion. Only some 
20,000 worshipers turned out, and when prayers ended about 20 
minutes ago, most of the worshipers dispersed." 
  Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 4 March adds 
that in a conversation with correspondent Aviv Bushinsky, Police 
Commissioner Rafi Peled said "that the Israel Police reached 
agreement with the Muslim waqf on the Temple Mount regarding 
ways to prevent confrontations between the Muslim worshipers and 
the police forces following Friday prayers. The commissioner 
noted that this is one of the steps the police took to prevent 
any violence. The other steps included the closure on the 
territories, as a result of which only residents of East 
Jerusalem attended the prayers. In addition, the police 
deployed massive forces in the Old City. 
  "The commissioner explained that the police decided to 
remove 
the Jewish worshipers from the Western Wall plaza for a limited 
time in order to ensure their safety. He stressed that this 
measure was taken in a bid to safeguard the Jewish worshipers."

<F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Sefi Hendler] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It looks as though Prime 
Minister Rabin is seriously pursuing the move to expand the 
coalition. Today, he held a phone conversation with Minister 
Shulamit Aloni and explained to her that not all the reports 
regarding this issue are accurate. Rabin told Meretz leader 
Aloni he wants to meet Meretz ministers tomorrow in order to 
explain the situation to them. 
  Meanwhile the Meretz Knesset faction convened in Tel Aviv 
today and decided to reject Tzomet's inclusion in the coalition 
at the present time. Environment Minister Yosi Sarid explains 
the decisions of his party: 
  [Begin Sarid recording] Meretz believes that the inclusion 
of Tzomet in the government at the present time is unwarranted 
and should be rejected. In the wake of the Hebron massacre and 
its grave repercussions Tzomet's inclusion would send out a 
negative message to our Palestinian interlocutors, Israeli Arabs 
and their public and Knesset representatives, and would have an 
adverse effect on the peace process' chances of quickly 
proceeding toward a positive conclusion. [end recording] 
  It is worthwhile to note that Minister Sarid put the 
emphasis 
on the present time. Meretz believes that at the present time 
Tzomet's inclusion would harm the peace process, but in a few 
months -- after the first stage of the Oslo agreement is 
implemented -- conditions could change. 
  Meretz's statement also mentioned SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim], calling on it to return to the coalition. Meretz is 
perhaps signalling to Rabin that they are willing to compromise 
on SHAS' return to the coalition. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Meretz party has decided to stick by its 
opposition to Refa'el Eytan's Tzomet party joining the coalition 
with Labor. Their position, outlined by Environment Minister 
Yosi Sarid, followed a meeting with Prime Minister Rabin at 
which he again asked Meretz to lift its veto on Tzomet. It was 
reported after this session that while Meretz did not rule out 
the possibility, they did not think this was the right time. 
Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said he got the impression 
that while Meretz would accommodate the Orthodox SHAS [Torah 
Observing Sephardim] party on issues of constitutional 
legislation, it would not budge where Tzomet was concerned. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan today refused to promise not to 
join the present government. He was speaking to settler leaders 
from Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip who visited him at his 
home in Tel 'Adashim, and expressed alarm at the reports of 
contacts between Tzomet and the ruling Labor party. However, 
Eytan called Qol Yisra'el this morning saying it was not true he 
had accepted the government's basic guidelines or its policy on 
the peace negotiations. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says his party will 
support 
the government, but only from the opposition benches, if it 
stops freeing terrorists and takes steps to restore security. 
Netanyahu made the statement at a right-wing demonstration, one 
of a series taking place every Friday at Ra'ananna in central 
Israel.

  [Text] A coalition crisis is possible. The Meretz Knesset 
faction threatens to walk out of the coalition the moment Labor 
starts negotiating with Tzomet on joining the government. This 
was decided tonight in a meeting attended by Meretz ministers 
and its caucus. Meretz notes that the coalition agreement gives 
it veto powers over other parties joining the coalition, and it 
is certain that Prime Minister Rabin will abide by the 
agreement. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Meretz 
says that coopting Tzomet into the coalition will constitute a 
negative message to the PLO leadership, Israel's Arab community, 
and the entire peace process. 
  Minister Shulamit Aloni informed Prime Minister Rabin of the 
Meretz decision. She said his response was indignation and that 
he said he would continue contacts with Tzomet. Minister Aloni 
said the prime minister thinks Meretz has to do his bidding and 
that he demands more from it than from his own party. She said 
they are two separate parties and the Meretz position also has 
to be taken into account. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent that 
following the Meretz decision his information permits 
negotiations into Tzomet joining the government. 
  Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the Meretz decision 
is strange. It is unclear why they rule out Tzomet, which is 
ready to join on the basis of the government's basic guidelines, 
he said.

  [Text] Kuwait City, March 5 (AFP)--A key defendant in the 
trial of 11 Iraqis and three Kuwaitis accused of trying to 
assassinate former US President George Bush retracted his 
confession on Saturday [5 March], pleading not guilty as the 
trial resumed at Kuwait's state security court. 
  Wali 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Ghazali, a 36-year-old Iraqi, denied 
working for the Iraqi intelligence service, reversing his stand 
when the trial opened on June 5. 
  At the request of lawyers for the two main 
defendants--al-Ghazali and another Iraqi, Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir 
al-'Assadi--the court adjourned the trial until April 2. 
  "I did myself wrong by my confessions," said al-Ghazali, 
denying that the Iraqi intelligence service employed him to 
assassinate Bush in a suicide mission in Kuwait in April 1993, 
using a car bomb or explosives strapped to his body. 
  Earlier al-Ghazali and al-'Assadi, 33, regarded as the 
ringleader of the group, said the Iraqi authorities had "forced" 
them to carry out the mission. 
  Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives 
into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot 
to assassinate Bush. 
  Iraqi Ahmad Jabbar Habib, 21, repeated his denial Saturday. 
  The other defendants also denied any involvement in the plot 
or links with Iraq. 
  The verdict in the trial was due to have been issued at the 
December session after having already been postponed from the 
end of October. 
  The human rights group Amnesty International alleged the 
trial was unfair, accusing the court of not meeting 
international standards. 
  Three defendants have said confessions were extracted by 
police beatings. 
  After a US investigation into the plot, Washington launched 
a 
cruise missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence headquarters in 
Baghdad on June 27, 1993. Iraq said six people were killed in 
the attack. 
  During the Bush administration U.S.-led multinational 
coalition forces drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait in February 
1991, ending their seven-month occupation of the emirate.

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, offered Friday prayers at the 
Grand Mosque in Sanaa. [passage omitted] 
  Following Friday prayers, the brother Presidential Council 
chairman spoke to the worshipers at the mosque and congratulated 
them for their blessed prayers, and reviewed the developments in 
the national arena in light of the signing of the document of 
accord and the current preparations for implementing and 
translating it on the ground. 
  He referred to the steps covered since the signing of the 
document in the Jordanian capital, Amman, and the regrettable 
ramifications that took place later. He especially emphasized 
the military field, and the measures adopted to stop these 
military ramifications, and the success realized by the joint 
military committee in this field. 
  He said that following the signing of the document, there 
was 
great hope that the crisis was over and that the beginning of a 
new stage was at hand, that the document would be implemented 
and that all parties would adhere to it. Regrettably, what 
happened showed the determination of certain people not to 
reunite the constitutional establishments to enable these 
establishments to carry out their duties in implementing the 
document. 
  The brother president said: In this address to you, I want 
to assure you and all the masses of our people that we will make 
every effort, alongside all unionists and good people, to 
contain the crisis. Let our people be sure that we will not 
allow discord and fighting among the sons of our people, we will 
not allow one drop of Yemeni blood to be shed for the sake of 
narrow interests, and we will not allow anyone to encroach on 
the homeland's security and stability. 
  He said that no one individual, party, or group has the 
right 
to maintain a mandate on unity or people, or any part of this 
people, adding that unity is a safeguard that will never be 
relinquished whatever the price might be. He said heroic Sanaa, 
the historical and political capital of the unified Yemeni 
homeland is a city for all unionists, and is the home for all 
Yemenis in all parts of the homeland. 
  He stressed that our people will stand firmly with unity, 
with democracy, and with the document of accord, and will 
confront those who sow strife and incite sectarian, racist, or 
tribal problems. The people will also confront all forces of 
renegades and secession. 
  The brother president said: We are concerned that Yemeni 
blood be spared and that our people be spared the difficulties 
and our country be spared the destruction. We will seek with 
all the power we have to build Yemen and avoid all the gloomy 
pictures it witnessed in the past. With the unity, we closed 
the files of the past. We will not permit the occurrence of new 
tragedies in the history of our people and homeland. 
  Those who speak in a loud voice about a state where law and 
order prevail should offer us the model they followed for 25 
years, in the economic, administrative, and development spheres 
to find the basic structure for development, and building the 
state. We do not need to speak more about the model they had 
offered to the citizens over that period of time. This model is 
well known to our people, part of whom still suffer from its 
tragic consequences. We regret to say that such people now seek 
the recurrence of this model throughout the entire homeland so 
that our entire Yemeni people will suffer, after already 
attaining their unity on 22 May 1990. Our people have hoped 
that this unity will be the dividing line between these dark 
ages and a new era based on freedom, democracy, justice, respect 
for human rights, and on real development from which the 
homeland benefits. We aspire to build a modern Yemeni state, a 
state where blood, honor, and property will be safeguarded, a 
state based on law and order, on free economic activities, and 
on fair competition for achieving what is better. We will not 
allow any force whatsoever to tamper with the security of the 
homeland and the tranquility of the citizen. 
  The brother president added: We want the specter of fear to 
end and the crisis to disappear for good from the minds of our 
people. We want our people to live a quiet and safe life far 
from the crises which some insist on repeating in the homeland's 
life and which poison the lives of the people. Some appear to 
have forgotten how to live without these crisis, something to 
which they have become accustomed during their lives. Our 
steadfast people in one part of the homeland have paid a 
prohibitive price for this. They now want all the people 
throughout the entire homeland to pay the price of this crisis 
which has been going on for over six months. Our people have 
suffered from tribulations and have sustained hardships as a 
result of this crisis. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman added: We and all 
the good people hope to welcome 'Id al-Fir with happiness and 
joy and with a sense of safety. We are confident that our 
people, who overcame many challenges through their history, will 
also pass this test and will maintain their determination to 
achieve unity, democracy, peace, and progress. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accused his 
southern rivals of conspiring to divide the country and vowed to 
prevent a split at any prince. 
  In a televised speech last night, President Salih said unity 
was a fact of life and that any thinking of secession is out of 
the question. He said it will not happen no matter what the 
price will be. 
  President Salih indirectly accused Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party of heightening military tensions. 
He said he warned those who insist on this course that they 
will pay the price. 
  He said a joint Yemeni-Jordanian and Omani military 
committee, which also includes the U.S. and French military 
attaches in Sanaa, was working to end the military tension and 
for the return of forces to their original bases.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Haydari, Iqbal 'Ali 'Abdallah, </F>
and Muhammad 'Allam: "Al-Bid Attacks 'Ali Salih, Warns of Loss 
of Control"] 
  [Excerpt] A series of developments yesterday reflected the 
persisting tension at political and military levels in Yemen, as 
the General People's Congress [GPC] refused to convene the 
Yemeni Council of Ministers in Aden, turning down a request by 
[Prime Minister] Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. And Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential 
Council, spoke for the second time about his willingness to step 
down if this is going to serve Yemen, its unity, and its 
democracy. 
  Sources in Sanaa have said that Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party, 
vehemently attacked President 'Ali Salih before the Yemeni 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee, with which he met the day 
before yesterday in Aden. The sources said that al-Bid accused 
'Ali Salih of "planning the military incidents witnessed 
recently in Abyan Governorate in the south of the country and in 
the Harf Sufyan area." He also said that "'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
was happy with the offensive launched against some refugees in 
the Harf Sufyan area and with the treacherous ambush set up in 
Abyan by the al-'Amaliqah Brigade against a small battalion from 
al-Wahdah Brigade." 
  Addressing members of the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid said: 
"I 
fear that we might lose control. I stopped an integrated 
military force which was on its way to hit and discipline 
al-'Amaliqah Brigade. And the central security camp in Aden is 
under siege, but we are not going to kill them in retaliation 
for what 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih did in Abyan and Harf Sufyan." 
  In his meeting with the Dialogue Committee, al-Bid proposed 
that Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier Mujahid Abu-Shawarib assume 
all military powers as regards the Armed Forces, in order to 
ease the severity of the military tension and return matters to 
their previous status. al-Bid asked Brig. Abu-Shawarib to 
contact President 'Ali Salih during the meeting to obtain 
permission to do so. 
  The sources emphasized that Brig. Abu-Shawarib did indeed 
contact the president and later told the meeting that 'Ali Salih 
had refused to give him the authorization. He told him: "How 
can we breach the authorization document given to the 
Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani military committee, when its ink has not 
dried yet? Such talk represents a contradiction in positions, 
and I do not believe that you would accept that, nor do I 
believe that it is honorable for us as leadership to do it." So 
al-Bid said: "Did I not tell you that his intentions are not 
sincere," pointing out that he knows well the GPC's military 
strength. And that he knows how many troops that force includes 
from the GPC, the Reform Grouping, and the Nasirites. He added: 
"So we believe that our position is the strongest. But our 
characteristic is that we examine the situation before making a 
decision." 
  Concluding, al-Bid said that the al-'Amaliqah forces in 
Abyan 
"attacked the party's offices and militias -- actions which 
explode the situation." He renewed his warning about losing 
control of the military situation if such actions continue. 
  In Aden, sources close to the Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee, which convened in the southern governorate of Abyan 
in the evening of the day before yesterday, said that "the 
committee's members failed to stop the deterioration in the 
situation in Abyan -- the deterioration which began on 21 
March." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aden, QNA [Qatari News Agency]--'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
Yemeni vice president and leader of the Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP], has announced a unilateral halt to what he termed 
vituperations and media campaigns, as of yesterday. 
  In a message to the Yemeni people, broadcast over Aden Radio 
last night, al-Bid said the decision was made by the YSP 
Political Bureau in observance of the citizens' sorrow over the 
death of former Yemeni President 'Abdallah al-Sallal and out of 
respect for the last holy days of Ramadan. 
  The vice president said in this regard: The decision, made 
under serious circumstances, reflected great sorrow over the 
death of Field Marshal 'Abdallah al-Sallal and our feelings 
about this mournful event.

  [Text] A group to defend Yemen's unity was formed in Sanaa 
yesterday on the initiative of a number of university 
professors. An informed source said this grouping, which has 
been called the "Popular Resistance" [al-muqawamah 
al-sha'biyah], will include hundreds of politicians from all 
trends, lawyers, doctors, and university professors, in addition 
to military commanders. The group calls for renouncing 
violence, rejecting division, and implementing the Amman 
document signed last month. 
  The source said the group will work among students and men 
of 
religion to organize popular resistance to face the possibility 
of war in the country. 
  Last Thursday, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
called 
on Yemenis to wage a peaceful struggle to implement the Amman 
document.

  [Text] Baghdad, March 5 (AFP)--An Iraqi daily called for an 
alliance with Libya and Sudan on Saturday [5 March] to oppose 
"imperialism and Zionism" following the Hebron massacre. 
  The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest 
son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya 
and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common 
stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the 
February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens 
of Moslem worshippers. 
  Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete 
inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of 
traitors among the Arab leaders." 
  Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and 
called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to 
declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron." 
  Arab-Israeli peace talks were suspended after the massacre. 
  The PLO has demanded that the United Nations guarantee 
protection for Palestinians in the occupied territories and that 
Israeli settlers be disarmed. 
  The newspaper also called on the ruling Baath party to hold 
a 
congress of Arab forces to "form an anti-colonialist and 
anti-Zionist front." 
  Meanwhile, the official Iraqi news agency INA Saturday 
expressed the hope that contacts between Iraqi and French 
officials would help toward the lifting of an international 
embargo imposed on Baghdad after its troops invaded Kuwait in 
August 1990. 
  "The Franco-Iraqi meetings in Paris, at the invitation of 
France, indicate that French diplomats will take steps aimed at 
lifting the embargo," INA said. 
  A senior Iraqi foreign ministry official, Riyad al-Qaysi, 
held talks with his French counterparts in Paris Friday. 
  The meetings were a sign of "France's willingness to resume 
relations with Iraq," INA said. 
  Al-Qaysi's visit came less than a week after one by a senior 
official of Baghdad's oil ministry, as a guest of the French oil 
companies Total and Elf-Aquitaine. 
  The companies are negotiating concessions to exploit 
petroleum deposits in southern Iraq once the UN embargo has been 
lifted. 
  Iraqi newspapers said al-Qaysi's talks in Paris were part of 
a diplomatic drive to get the embargo lifted, and he would also 
visit China. He went to Russia on February 22. 
  Under the 1991 Gulf war ceasefire conditions the oil embargo 
may be lifted once Iraq has fulfilled UN demands for the 
dismantling of its weapons programmes.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA)--The AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper 
says the United States has become virtually isolated in its 
calls for the continued enforcement of sanctions against Iraq, 
particularly since it has seen with its own eyes the 
disintegration of its international coalition. 
  In an article published today, the paper adds: Despite the 
fact that the U.S. position on the embargo has remained 
unchanged, as attested to by the recent report Clinton submitted 
to the U.S. Congress, there has been a change in the French and 
British positions on the embargo. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The French position is showing signs of 
change, as manifested in the Iraqi-French political and oil 
talks and the statements made by the French foreign minister, in 
which he said that there is a strong likelihood of Iraq resuming 
its oil exports shortly. 
  The paper goes on to say: Despite the fact that the British 
position on the embargo is still close to the U.S. position, 
there has been a noticeable watering down of the intransigent 
anti-Iraq rhetoric used by British officials. As for Russia and 
the PRC, they are sympathetic to the efforts to lift the embargo 
imposed on Iraq. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH says: These indications, coupled with Iraq's 
cooperation and its implementation of the provisions enshrined 
in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, underscore the 
need to lift the embargo, because there are no justifications 
for maintaining it. 
  The paper concludes by saying: The continuation of the 
embargo means that Washington is implementing the most dangerous 
chapter of its grand anti-Iraq conspiracy, and that it is 
working to stifle Iraq; and this is something the Iraqi people 
oppose and will never accept.

  [Excerpt] The Iraqi regime is playing a malignant and 
sabotaging role in deepening the Yemeni crisis and breaking the 
unity of the Yemeni people. For some time, the Iraqi regime has 
been interfering in Yemen's internal affairs, particularly after 
the successful democratic experiment in Yemen. With this 
experiment, the Yemeni people in both parts of the country opted 
for unity and coexistence under a single regime to prevent the 
country from sliding into the cycle of conflicts and crises. By 
depending on the people's will and by going back to the people, 
Yemeni unity was achieved. 
  Naturally, the Baghdad regime does not feel comfortable 
about 
the success of any experiment that may smell of democracy and in 
which the peoples have a decisive say. Thus, the Baghdad regime 
decided to inflame the Yemeni crisis and steadily sought to 
undermine Yemeni unity, hoping to gain a foothold there by 
creating a fragile pro-Iraqi regime in Yemen that would follow 
in its footsteps and accept whatever Iraqi dictator Saddam 
Husayn imposed on it. 
  According to Iraqi opposition sources, the Yemeni Socialist 
Party has expressed concern with the sabotaging role played by 
the Baghdad regime in the Yemeni crisis. Instead of lending a 
helping hand to bring the views of the two conflicting parties 
in Yemen closer, the Iraqi regime is trying hard to deepen their 
differences by backing one party against the other. Reports 
indicate that 12 Iraqi pilots have arrived in Sanaa to train and 
support the northerners' troops. The same reports indicate that 
during the past two months the Iraqi Embassy in Sanaa was the 
scene of meetings between military commanders who support Yemeni 
president 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Iraqi military attache in 
Sanaa. To further increase tensions in Yemen, some members of 
the pro-Baghdad Yemeni Ba'th Party kidnapped a number of 
foreigners some time ago and held them with some of the tribes 
affiliated with the party. Furthermore, the Baghdad 
intelligence service in Yemen in the past few years has 
assassinated several Yemeni political and scientific figures.

  [Text] Amman--AL-SHURUQ has learned from sources close to 
the Jordanian Royal Court that an Iraqi Kurdish delegation 
visited Amman secretly more than a week ago and met with several 
Jordanian officials. 
  According to these sources, the delegation gave King Husayn 
an official request for the king's mediation with Iraqi 
President Saddam Husayn. They asked him to help facilitate the 
resumption of the Kurdish-Iraqi dialogue on the self-rule 
negotiations that started in May 1991 with visits to Baghdad by 
Kurdish leaders Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani. The 
negotiations came to a halt in July 1992 when the Kurds joined 
the opposition delegations visiting Western capitals to ask for 
support to topple the regime in Iraq. 
  The sources said that the Kurds' need to resume the dialogue 
with Baghdad appears urgent now with the lack of prospects for 
the Kurdish plan in northern Iraq. This is mainly due to 
Iranian and Turkish fears over their domestic situations and the 
possibilities for division and the redrawing of maps in the 
region, which has not seen stability for dozens of years. It is 
also due to indications that the international embargo imposed 
on Iraq could possibly end next June. 
  The Jordanian sources say they do not expect King Husayn to 
respond quickly to the Kurdish desire out of fear of Arab 
reactions, especially since he is now in the process of 
normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf 
states. He also fears a new failure in his mediations, 
especially since he has not yet recovered from the failure in 
his mediation between the parties to the Yemeni crisis.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Zionist Crime and </F>
American Position"] 
  [Text] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was another perfect 
example of the criminal, fascist mentality of the Zionist entity 
and showed how thirsty the Zionists are for Palestinian blood. 
The U.S. attitude toward the atrocity, which has claimed 400 
casualties, once more exposes America's open and consistent bias 
toward the usurper Zionist entity, as well as underscoring its 
abiding willingness to extend political protection to that 
entity at the United Nations, not to mention the apologies and 
alibis afforded the Zionist entity by U.S. media 
  Typical of its approach to the savageries the Zionist entity 
has committed against the Palestinian Arab people, the United 
States has, for the past three days, been bending over backwards 
not only to contain and deflect the angry reactions to the crime 
and its perpetrators and to underplay the bloodbath and its 
consequences, but also to shield the Zionist entity from any 
international measures. The Clinton administration has not 
limited itself to throwing its full weight behind Tel Aviv; it 
stands ready to keep the UN Security Council from passing a 
resolution decreeing protection for the Palestinian people in 
the occupied territories and demanding that the Zionist entity 
take immediate measures to curb the illegal practices of the 
Zionist settlers. 
  It was entirely predictable that the draft resolution 
submitted by the nonaligned group at the United Nations should 
come up against U.S. opposition. Particularly objectionable to 
the United States is the paragraph stipulating international 
protection for the Palestinian people. Washington argues that 
such a resolution would set back the ongoing peace process. 
Another disagreeable paragraph to the Americans is the one 
calling on Israel to curb the settlers' scandalous actions 
against the Palestinian population. Beyond that, the United 
States has come out against disarming these settlers! 
  At the end of the day, what the Clinton administration 
really 
wants is for the negotiations to resume. As for stemming the 
flow of Palestinian blood, it could not be bothered. Seen 
against this backdrop, Clinton's call for the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks to resume in Washington is a wretched 
and transparent attempt to whitewash the Zionist crime and shift 
the attention of the Palestinian, Arab, and world opinion away 
from the atrocity. From a U.S. perspective, the progress of the 
talks seems to count for more than Palestinian blood. 
  In any event, this is not the first time that the United 
States has acted disgracefully, nor will it be the last. The 
U.S. attitude now fits in with a pattern of open U.S. partiality 
to the Zionist enemy. Still fresh in our memory is the crime 
perpetrated by the Zionists at al-Aqsa Mosque in October, 1990 
and how the Bush administration manipulated the Security Council 
into passing a weak resolution condemning violence in general 
terms. Will the Clinton administration get the Council to issue 
a similarly weak resolution with empty expressions of 
condemnation that have no value in the face of this 
state-sponsored Zionist terror?! 
  There is an elementary truth that the imperialists and their 
allies and agents will not recognize, and that is that the 
Palestinian people, who have been engaged in a bloody and 
ceaseless struggle for the past 40-odd years and who have 
offered huge sacrifices as they stood up to Zionist coercion and 
occupation, are not about to relent in the battle against terror 
and repression. The Palestinians will carry on with their heroic 
fight and make further sacrifices until their right to an 
independent state on their national soil is recognized.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "No to the Massacre, No to Degradation"] </F>
  [Text] Had most Arab rulers and officials not degraded 
themselves, their dignity, and the rights of their nation, the 
massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron would never have 
occurred. The Zionist enemy's calculations would have been 
totally different as well, especially since it is a usurper 
entity, whose true aims cannot be concealed by claims of 
security and military superiority while the memory of the 
glorious battle and al-Husayn missiles is still vivid in our 
minds. 
  Unfortunately, many Arab rulers and officials have degraded 
themselves, Palestine, and Iraq, whom they are now blockading 
after participating in the aggression against it. They were 
against Iraq when it was facing Israel alone; a sole warrior 
knowing no hesitation or compromise over rights despite all the 
support Israel garnered from the imperialist and neo-imperialist 
forces. 
  Here the degradation and the compromises have produced their 
racist Zionist puss. The Zionist entity has dared to commit a 
hideous massacre, killing prostrate worshipers in the mosque of 
Ibrahimi, the grandfather of prophets, at dawn prayer on a 
Friday in the holy month of Ramadan. 
  Could there be anything more degrading than this massacre?!! 
  If the boiling public anger were to react by avenging Arab 
honor, becoming an anger for Palestine, its people, martyrs, and 
our holy places, then it is also bound to clash with those 
governments that pledged to guarantee the security of Israel and 
the safety of its existence and borders. They used all their 
political, financial, and military weight to kill the 
Palestinian revolution, as a weapon and a source of strength. 
They have also gone a long way toward sponsoring and 
encouraging submission and deviation, until some of them joined 
the U.S. settlement bandwagon, which was started by Bush and 
Baker and is now continued by Clinton and Christopher. 
  When everything -- the land, the people, the holy places, 
and 
the factors of history and geography -- becomes negotiable, then 
even the martyrs' blood is seen by these degraded weaklings as a 
surmountable problem. For instance, they think it is sufficient 
to switch the talks from Cairo to Washington, amid theatrical 
appeals for self-restraint, in order to continue the 
negotiations so as not to hamper the negotiation process. This 
is itself a political massacre of the Palestine question. 
  We wonder, had this crime been committed by someone else, 
would we have heard the same calm U.S. diplomatic talk? Or 
would we have witnessed threats, fast UN resolutions, military 
reinforcements from all direction, pressures, sanctions, and 
land, air, and sea blockades on all political and economic 
levels?! 
  With the Ibrahimi Mosque bloodbath, the world stands face to 
face with the U.S. sword that threatens world nations, their 
rights, and honor. Here is the UN Security Council, despite all 
the martyrs who fell on their national soil at the tombs of the 
prophets and martyrs razed by Israeli Army bullets as a 
punishment for their bereavement; here is the Security Council, 
after quarter of a century of occupation and half a century of 
usurpation, destitution, and murder, still holding consultations 
in unofficial sessions to draft a resolution renewing its 
confidence in the Israeli Government's ability to tackle the 
situation in a just and wise manner. 
  In order to throw dust in our eyes, the capitals of 
domination and oppression have issued verbal condemnations, shed 
crocodile tears over the victims, and declared their deep 
concern about the fate of the settlement and the negotiation 
process!! 
  Amid this Arab fragmentation and all this degradation and 
submission to the tyrant and the enemy, amid the absence of 
international legality and the Arab League's use of the American 
language rather than the Arabic language, and amid the dwarfing 
of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic Conference 
Organization, this massacre has occurred with all its ugliness 
and implications. It has shown to the people of Palestine, the 
Arab nation, and all Muslims a glaring picture of their present 
status and what their future will hold if this weakness, 
fragmentation, and absence become solidified under agreements 
that are now being dictated by Washington so that Tel Aviv, with 
all its power and nuclear weapons, would be free to shed more 
Arab blood and to occupy our lands and holy places. 
  What the enemies want must not be our inevitable fate. Here 
is giant Iraq standing high and proud with its full willpower, 
honor, and historic leadership; and here are the heroes of the 
intifadah with all their vigor, filling the land of Palestine 
with stones, bullets, and martyrs to prove that they are strong 
and that their resolve knows no despair or fatigue. These 
heroes disdain every false and crafty condemnation, because they 
and all honorable Arabs and Muslims know that they have the 
final say in this epic struggle, whose fire could not be 
extinguished for 75 years on the land of Palestine. Their epic 
is Palestine's modern history, which will become more radiant 
with the blood of the righteous martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Immortality and glory to the martyrs. 
  Glory to the fighting revolutionaries. 
  Long live Palestine free and Arab. 
  Long live our glorious Arab nation. 
  God is great.

  [Text] Baghdad, 5 Mar (INA) -- The AL-'IRAQ newspaper has 
denounced the rabid, malicious, and tendentious media and 
diplomatic campaign launched by the Clinton administration 
against Iraq. 
  In its editorial today, the paper notes the periodic report 
sent by the U.S. President on 3 March to Congress. The report 
was primarily targeted against Iraq. It employed a long series 
of deliberate false arguments, disregarded facts, and was 
blindly carried away by Zionist desires. 
  The paper says the Clinton administration is entertaining a 
great illusion and falling into the abyss of cheap lies and 
blatant deception if it thinks that it can succeed through its 
octopus and diabolical media machine. This machine excels in 
telling lies and fabricating accusations to influence world 
public opinion in favor of U.S. stupidities when the question of 
lifting the embargo is discussed. 
  AL-'IRAQ further argues that the position of the Clinton 
administration, reflected in its spiteful report to Congress, 
reveals to the whole world the extent of the involvement of the 
U.S. President and his Zionist advisers, such as Tony Lake and 
Martin Indyk, in a plot to turn the Security Council and the 
international family against Iraq. They are doing this in the 
hope of maintaining the savage embargo, after it has lost all 
its justifications. 
  The paper asserts that by continuing to antagonize the 
unyielding Iraqi people, going to extremes to have more unjust 
resolutions issued, and relentlessly seeking to maintain current 
resolutions against Iraq, the Clinton administration will only 
reap failure, humiliation, and hatred. 
  The paper adds: The criminal Bush wagered on starving the 
Iraqi people and defeating it eventually through the economic 
blockade. However, Bush ended up in the trash can of history. 
The Iraqi people have maintained their steadfastness, worked 
miracles, and pursued their reconstruction drive. Bush only 
reaped disgrace, shame, and eternal damnation. Clinton will 
reap the same fruits if he continues his losing wager on the 
Iraqis' endurance and steadfastness.

  [Text] Baghdad, 5 Mar (INA) -- An Iraqi newspaper has held 
U.S. President Bill Clinton responsible for maintaining the 
criminal embargo against the people of Iraq and closing all 
doors to questions being strongly raised about the reasons for 
its continuation after Iraq has fulfilled the obligations 
spelled out by Security Council resolutions. 
  In its editorial today, AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the U.S. 
President has asked Congress to continue to support the embargo, 
citing a series of fabricated stories and lies, which have been 
worn out by repetition. The U.S. President has even taken a 
further step by appointing himself a "guardian" over Iraq and 
its people and poking his nose in its domestic affairs. 
  The paper notes the extreme frustration the Clinton 
administration has faced as a result of two connected phenomena 
in the Arab nation. The first phenomenon is the collapse of two 
pillars of U.S. policy following the aggression against Iraq, 
the regimes of Fahd and Husni Mubarak. The second is that Iraq 
has maintained popular support all over the Arab nation and that 
Saddam Husayn has continued to be a symbol of pan-Arab honor and 
adherence to honorable values in the Arab nation and the Islamic 
world. 
  The paper asserts that the steadfastness of the Iraqi people 
and the genius of President Saddam Husayn have changed regional 
and Arab equations in their favor. They have also defeated 
attempts by Western-Zionist media to influence the masses of the 
region and drive them to antagonize Iraq.

  [Text] Baghdad, 7 Mar (INA) -- AL-QADISIYAH has stressed 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton realizes well that his 
statements against Iraq are nothing but unfounded fallacies and 
lies. 
  In an article today, the paper adds that UN committees have 
emphasized that Iraq has fully met its obligations toward the 
resolutions issued against it, and that this requires that the 
UN Security Council meet its obligations toward the Iraqi people 
and prove its credibility to the world through the immediate 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. 
  The paper indicates that having given up his role as the 
president of a superpower, Clinton has handed the command to the 
Zionist lobby controlling U.S. policy, thus turning himself into 
a Zionist advocate at the expense of the U.S. interests and 
other peoples struggling for advancement. 
  AL-QADISIYAH explains that U.S. world policy is dominated by 
arrogant and haughty tendencies and by the logic of force, 
paying no attention to other peoples' rights. Such a policy, 
the paper says, must backfire against its makers, leading them 
to the abyss. 
  Concluding its article, AL-QADISIYAH says that when Clinton 
attempts to oppose the progress of a lively people such as the 
Iraqi people, who are supported by all struggling peoples, or 
when he threatens other nations with sanctions unless they give 
up their own interests in favor of U.S. interests, he should 
realize that the law of life and the logic of evolution say that 
the future is made by creative, lively peoples who are enriched 
by experiences and hardened by ordeals.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA) -- The newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
maintains that the U.S. Administration is using democracy and 
human rights as political cards to damage the interests of world 
peoples and undermine their abilities to freely make political 
decisions and pursue independent options. 
  In an article published today under the headline "Clinton, 
Ignorance, and Zionist Motives", the paper, which speaks for the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, adds: When they advance arguments 
grounded in the U.S. concept of human rights and U.S. national 
security, U.S. officials forget that other world peoples have 
their own national security to worry about, and that they also 
have human rights that must be respected. 
  The paper wonders: Since democracy is rooted in dialogue, 
how can anybody who professes to be a democrat and a staunch 
advocate of democracy reject dialogue and wave the big stick in 
the face of anyone who chooses to hold a dissenting view? 
  The paper notes the periodic report U.S. President Bill 
Clinton submitted to Congress. In this report, the paper says, 
Clinton spoke, thanks to the bad advice offered him by his 
Zionist advisers, of what he called Iraq's sponsorship of 
terrorism, and of human rights violations in Iraq. Clinton said 
Iraqi policy continues to pose threats to U.S. national security 
and to U.S. foreign policy -- something that prompts the United 
States to support the continued enforcement of the economic 
sanctions against it. 
  The paper adds: The U.S. President has deliberately chosen 
to overlook the fact that there is a UN Security Council [UNSC] 
resolution passed at Washington's urging, i.e., Resolution 687, 
that must be taken into account in this regard. The U.S. 
President has chosen to forget that Iraq has honored all its 
commitments toward this resolution, and that, consequently, the 
UNSC must immediately honor the provisions enshrined in 
Paragraph 22 of this resolution by lifting the sanctions clamped 
on Iraq. According to the rules in force, Iraq is entitled to 
see the embargo lifted. The UNSC must act to lift the sanctions. 
  The paper goes on to say: Clinton has set fresh terms for 
lifting the sanctions clamped on Iraq prior to the UNSC's 
periodic review of the sanctions. His statements will not fall 
on receptive ears at the UNSC, particularly since the positions 
of the UNSC permanent members on the embargo have experienced a 
clear change due to Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments toward 
Resolution 687. 
  The paper accuses the U.S. president of taking positions 
that 
reflect a flagrant ignorance of the geopolitical facts of the 
Arab region, of the cohesive political regime in Iraq, and of 
the Iraqi people's rallying around its nationalist leadership. 
  The paper adds: Clinton must understand that his implication 
of Iraq in terrorism is meaningless. It is clear to those near 
and far that Iraq has nothing to do with terrorism. Clinton is 
aware of who the real terrorists are. Iraq has never been 
involved in the terrorism game, the parties to which have become 
known to all. 
  The paper notes the hostage games and the bargaining 
conducted between the United States, some Western countries, and 
some Middle Eastern parties and political regimes. The paper 
says this is flagrant proof of the involvement of the United 
States and these parties in terrorism. This shows Iraq has 
nothing to do with terrorism. 
  AL-THAWRAH says the "human rights" argument raised by the 
U.S. Administration whenever the UNSC's periodic review of the 
Iraq sanctions approaches has become ridiculous. 
  The paper urges the United States to adopt a balanced policy 
toward Iraq and the Arab homeland, because it is not in its 
interest to see Iraq weakened, as Clinton's advisers must have 
deluded him into believing. Iraq is a crucially important 
factor for development, progress, stability, and equilibrium in 
the region. It is a factor conducive to world security and 
peace. As for the embargo, it is about to be defeated, whether 
Clinton likes it or not.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, adviser to Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, has announced that the United Nations is about to 
reach an agreement, which will receive United States backing, to 
deploy armed international observers to protect the Palestinians 
in the occupied territories. 
  Sha'th told MBC in Washington today that he discussed the 
Palestinian demands in this regard with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher. 
  [Begin recording] [MBC correspondent in Washington 'Aziz 
Fahmi] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher received Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, in Washington this morning in an attempt to settle the 
current differences between the two sides over the Palestinians' 
return to the negotiating table. The Americans want the 
negotiations to resume now and then discuss during the 
negotiations securing protection for the Palestinians and 
disarming the settlers. But the Palestinians want to settle this 
before they return to the negotiating table as a condition for 
the resumption of the negotiations. 
  The MBC met Dr. Sha'th before he left for the State 
Department to meet Warren Christopher. 
  [Sha'th] We are here for negotiations with the U.S. side to 
secure all means of international protection, disarming the 
settlers, and the necessary security measures to guarantee 
security for the Palestinian people. These are the requirements 
for restoring momentum to the peace process to complete our 
achievements. Hence, I believe the U.S. side understands that 
there is need for Palestinian security but it should understand 
that this requires measures, not just an expression of 
principles. 
  [Fahmi] What if they refuse? 
  [Sha'th] We do not jump to conclusions. We have come here to 
meet Secretary Christopher to get what we want. So I cannot 
begin the talks by expecting a rejection. 
  [Fahmi] Meanwhile, press sources cited the PLO 
representative 
at the United Nations as saying that Dr. Nabil Sha'th must 
discuss with Warren Christopher the deadlocked UN discussions. 
It is known that the United States suspended these discussions 
until it reaches agreement with the Palestinians on drafting the 
resolution due to be passed by the Security Council. The 
Palestinians' main aim now is to secure Israel's and United 
States' consent to the principle of the presence of 
international observers to protect the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. Israel has rejected this demand since it 
occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat will arrive in Cairo within the next 48 hours for a 
visit to Egypt during the visit, he will hold urgent 
consultations with President Husni Mubarak on the latest 
developments after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. 
  'Arafat will meet with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and Dr. 
Usamah al-Baz, director of President Mubarak's Office for 
Political Affairs. He and the Egyptian officials will discuss 
ways to achieve the Palestinian demands that the PLO has set as 
conditions for the resumption of peace talks with Israel. The 
PLO suspended its participation in these talks because of the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Sa'id Kamal said 
Egypt--President Mubarak, the government, and the great 
people--has been and will remain the main supporter of the Arab 
and Palestinian people. 
  In a statement to MENA, he added that the growing support of 
the Egyptian and Arab nations for the condition of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories following the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre confirms Egypt's continuing, 
pioneering role in maintaining pan-Arab security.

  [Text] According to a report by our correspondent, a 
resolution signed by more than 140 deputies was read during the 
Majles open session this afternoon condemning the horrific 
crimes of the Zionists in Hebron and the mysterious and 
treacherous silence of international forums and false supporters 
of human rights. 
  The resolution--expressing support for His Eminence Imam 
Khomeyni's justified stand on the need for the elimination of 
the Zionist regime from the world map and following the esteemed 
leader's stand--has emphasized: The solution to the problem of 
Zionism and uprooting of this cancerous tumor will not be 
possible except through continuation of the armed conflict. 
  The resolution, in part, says: What is tragic in the wake of 
this painful development is the fact that global arrogance--led 
by America and criminal Zionism--has declared the occurrence of 
this tragedy as solid preparation for continuation of the 
compromising talks and has expressed the need for speeding up 
the sell-out plan. 
  In the conclusion of the resolution, the deputies of the 
Islamic Majles have called upon our country's noble and 
revolutionary people and all freedom loving people and Muslims 
of the world to pour out the fire of their revolutionary wrath 
and anger against the usurping Zionism, through enthusiastic 
participation in rallies of the international Jerusalem Day, and 
to repay their debt to the unjustly shed blood of the innocent 
Palestinians by chanting slogans of death to Israel and death to 
America.

  [Editorial Report] Amman radio and television carry live 
broadcasts on 4 March of Friday prayers from mosques in Amman. 
  Amman Radio Jordan Network in Arabic at 0900 GMT on 4 March 
carries a live broadcast of Friday prayers from al-Husayni 
Mosque in central Amman. The broadcast includes a 36-minute 
"religious lesson" by Dr. Dawud al-Fa'uri of the University of 
Jordan's Islamic Sharia college. 
  Al-Fa'uri begins by hailing those who died in the Hebron 
massacre on 25 February. The preacher questions the behavior of 
those who claim to be "the chosen people of God, and the sons 
and beloved of God, only to appear in their true colors in front 
of the whole world as enemies of God, humanity, and peace." 
  He says: "How can they describe as extremism the behavior of 
the innocent child who hurls a stone at the man who attacked him 
and took all of his possessions, and fail to call extremism the 
flagrant shooting of those who are prostrated before God in 
prayer at the Khalil al-Rahman [Abraham] Mosque?" 
  Al-Fa'uri adds: "The first party responsible for the kind of 
extremism and murder that has taken place is the Israeli 
Government, which fights extremism elsewhere while nurturing it 
at home. It gave weapons to the settlers and has watched the 
extremism of Jewish religious groups such as the Kakh Movement, 
the Kahane Movement, and Shas. The least the Israeli Government 
should have done was to withdraw weapons from the settlers and 
the extremist religious organization, at least during the peace 
talks. The least it should have done is to execute all those 
who carried out the murders in front of the whole world, as it 
does when it brings down homes on the heads of their residents 
based on a suspicion or for throwing a stone." 
  Al-Fa'uri blames Arabs and Muslims for their disunity, 
despite factors of similarity among them. He blames the 
international community for closing its eyes to anti-Arab and 
anti-Islamic crimes. He congratulates those who are steadfastly 
defending "their brothers, honor, and property" in the occupied 
territory and calls on believers to help them in every possible 
way. He urges the people to follow the example of King Husayn 
in contributing to their Palestinian brothers and praised the 
Jordanian people's stand in support of the Palestinian people. 
  Al-Fa'uri devotes the remainder of his "lesson" to the 
merits 
of the fasting month of Ramadan and al-Qadr night, during which 
the Koran was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. 
  Amman radio also carries another a 23-minute "sermon" on 
obedience to God's teachings. The unidentified preacher laments 
the poor condition of Muslims, which he attributes to their 
failure to follow their true religion, and praises ancient 
Islamic tradition. The preacher refers to massacres and 
injustice committed against Muslims in the world, including the 
Hebron massacre committed by "the Zionists". He praises the 
Hebron victims, who will have their "reward in the hereafter." 
He asks the people to contribute to the support of the 
families of the victims. 
  Amman Jordan Television Network in Arabic at 0945 GMT 
carries 
a live broadcast from King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman that 
includes a 24-minute sermon on religious values and the merits 
of the holy month of Ramadan.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has again indicated he 
will not accept the PLO's demand for an international force to 
protect the Palestinians because this, in his view, would mean 
reopening agreements reached with the PLO for further 
negotiations. Rabin was addressing a seminar at the Hebrew 
University on the subject of the civil service in the time of 
peace. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] There is no point in 
negotiating an agreement if after a short time it can be 
reopened, Rabin said, for if that is the case, there must be 
serious doubt about the value of any new agreement which will be 
negotiated in the future. In the wake of the Hebron massacre, 
the PLO has demanded the stationing of an international force in 
the territories, the withdrawal of settlers from Hebron, and the 
wholesale disarming of settlers as conditions for a resumption 
of the talks, but in Rabin's view, this would mean rewriting the 
agreements reached in Oslo and more recently in Cairo. This 
view was echoed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the Knesset 
this morning, after he appeared before the Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee: 
  [Peres] The time, which is evaporating and disappearing, is 
a crucial one, and I personally believe that the most 
contributing change to the present situation will be the 
implementation of the agreement. Instead of opening the 
agreement, let's better realize it, and then all of us will see 
that we do not have an agreement about a piece of paper, but we 
do have an agreement about the new reality. 
  [Katzenell] Also present at the Hebrew University seminar 
today was Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. He did 
not agree that the PLO's demands constituted a reopening of 
signed agreements: 
  [Al-Tibi] At present, 'Arafat and the PLO leadership is 
committed to the peace process. We are not talking about 
opening agreements; we are talking about a new circumstance that 
was created after the massacre. The most important and cardinal 
point should be security for Palestinian civilians. This issue 
should be solved as soon as possible for the sake of both 
parties in order that we will be able to come back to the 
negotiating table. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 March carries 
a similar report, noting that al-Tibi added "that we are in the 
midst of an agreement which, in another five years, will bring 
about a Palestinian state in all the territories captured in 
1967. During this process, Israel must provide answers to the 
burning security issues of the Palestinians in the territories. 
Al-Tibi also said that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], as the 
sovereign power in the territories, failed in the defense of the 
Palestinian residents."] 
  [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin called on the PLO 
leadership to overcome the pain and anger created by the Hebron 
massacre and return to the negotiating table quickly. The 
longer this is delayed, Rabin warned, the more opportunity there 
will be for Palestinian terrorists or, perhaps, another Jewish 
madman to exploit the break. [end recording]

  [Text] Riyad al-Qaysi, Foreign Ministry undersecretary for 
international relations, is holding talks in Paris, while Oil 
Ministry Undersecretary Taha Humud is putting the finishing 
touches on cooperation negotiations between Iraq and the French 
Total and Elf-Aquitaine companies to develop oil investments in 
Iraq. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe recently said it is 
highly likely that Iraq will soon resume its oil exports. A 
French source said Iraqi-French negotiations on developing oil 
investments have been conducted on a regular basis in Baghdad. 
The talks were moved this week to Paris where an Iraqi 
delegation, led by the Oil Ministry undersecretary, has arrived. 
  Moving the talks to Paris indicates the extent of the 
progress made and France's desire to restore relations with 
Iraq. The visit was made at the invitation of France. This 
means French diplomacy will act to lift the embargo. The two 
French oil companies have shown interest because Iraq has the 
world's second largest oil reserves. 
  Commenting on this development in Iraqi-French ties, British 
sources in London said Iraq will likely become, once the embargo 
is lifted, an arena for competition among French, Italian, 
German, British, and U.S. companies. Officials from these 
companies have been frequenting Baghdad for months to win 
contracts with Iraq, especially in the field of food agriculture 
and pharmaceutical items not included by the embargo. They are 
awaiting major deals worth tens of billions of dollars, as was 
the case in the seventies and eighties, once the embargo is 
completely lifted. 
  Even if the embargo is partially lifted, this would 
constitute progress, since the Iraqi economy has high production 
capabilities and rich resources.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--MENA has learned that 
diplomatic contacts are being held on the "highest level" in 
Cairo to work out a Palestinian-Israeli formula to overcome the 
obstacles hindering a UN Security Council resolution condemning 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, providing international 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories, and taking into account the resumption of 
negotiations in accordance with a Palestinian-Israeli bilateral 
agreement. 
  Diplomatic sources have told MENA that the current brief 
visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
political adviser Jacques Neriya, comes within these accelerated 
contacts. 'Arafat categorically rejected a meeting in Cairo 
with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at Peres' request. 
  MENA has learned that the visiting Israeli envoy is carrying 
a proposal to hold an urgent meeting in Cairo or Washington 
between 'Arafat and Rabin to reach a formula for an agreement to 
resume the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
  The agency has also learned that the Israeli side is willing 
to implement the Gaza-Jericho Agreement within three weeks from 
the conclusion of negotiations in this connection. 
  The Egyptians and Palestinians are making contacts with the 
United States in its capacity as a sponsor of the peace process 
to guarantee the safety of the Palestinian people and work out a 
new basis for negotiations in the stage to come. 
  Official Palestinian sources have told MENA that no meeting 
between 'Arafat and Peres is acceptable right now and under the 
current circumstances, especially as the Palestinian people are 
worried and lack confidence in the Israeli Government's promises. 
  Diplomatic sources told MENA that in light of the 
Palestinians' refusal to meet with Peres, Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, current chairman of the EU's Ministerial 
Council, has requested an urgent meeting with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat. In that meeting, held at Cairo 
Airport, Papoulias handed 'Arafat Israeli proposals aiming to 
overcome the obstacles facing the resumption of the 
Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations. 
  The Palestinian side, MENA learned, rejected the Israeli 
proposals, which aim to reach a bilateral deal sidestepping the 
UN Security Council. The Israeli proposals are in line with the 
policy approved by the Israeli cabinet in its 27 February 
session. 
  The main features of this policy are: 
  - Emptying the Hebron area of settlers. 
  - Forming a committee of inquiry into the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. 
  - Taking tougher measures against "some" extremist Israeli 
settlers in the West Bank, such as: 
  a. The institution of administrative detention. 
  b. The imposition of military restrictions and control on 
the movement of some extremists into the West Bank, particularly 
Hebron. 
  c. The cancellation of the gun licenses of some extremist 
Israeli settlers and their disarmament. 
  d. The Israeli Government's legal adviser is to examine 
the possibility of outlawing the Kakh and Kahane groups. 
  e. The release of 1,000 Palestinian detainees. Eight 
hundred were released last week. 
  The Israeli Government also decided to pay compensation for 
the families of the victims of the Hebron massacre. 
  According to the same diplomatic sources, the massacre at 
the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron has created a new reality 
necessitating a new form of dealing and communication between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis. The Israelis, for their 
part, are still trying to prevent the condemnation of the 
massacre by the UN Security Council. 
  According to these sources, Rabin maintains that he cannot 
control the domestic situation in Israel in view of the 
fragility of the current coalition. It is worth noting that a 
wave of anger swept through Israel following the massacre. 
  The Palestinians, meanwhile, insist on international 
protection of Palestinians living in the occupied territories. 
Such protection, the Palestinians say, can be provided through 
the deployment of international observes working either under a 
mandate from the UN Security Council or a Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement. Such agreement would specify the number and 
nationalities of the observers, along the line of the existing 
agreement between Egypt and Israel. 
  The Palestinians also insist that all Palestinian detainees 
in Israel be promptly released. They note that the Palestinian 
need for security guarantees matches that of the settlers. 
  It is worth noting that 9,400 Palestinians are in Israeli 
jails and detention camps, in accordance with the latest Red 
Cross count. 
  The Palestinians also seek improved living conditions for 
the 
Palestinians living in the occupied territories until the 
implementation of the self-rule agreement.

  [Text] The radio's central news unit correspondent has 
learned that Jacques Neriya, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's political adviser, met with Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat in Cairo today. The Israeli envoy presented the 
Palestinian president specific Israeli ideas on overcoming the 
crisis resulting from the attack on worshipers in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and on creating a general climate that will 
allow the PLO to resume the negotiations. 
  President 'Arafat discussed with the Israeli prime 
minister's 
adviser the measures that have to be taken to protect the 
Palestinians in the Arab territories. These measures include 
the protection of the Palestinians, provision of security for 
them, and a nonrepetition of the Hebron incident. 
  The radio correspondent also learned that the Palestinian 
side stressed the importance of disarming the settlers, 
restricting or dissolving the extremist organizations, removing 
the settlers from Hebron and densely populated Palestinian 
areas, and providing the necessary protection for the 
Palestinians. 
  President 'Arafat met with Neriya before the former's 
departure from Cairo this afternoon.

<F P=106> [From the "Economic Cast"] </F>
  [Text] Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', chairman of the 
Palestinian Reconstruction and Development Council has told MBC 
Television that Palestinian and Israeli delegations, who have so 
far held five rounds of economic negotiations, are having 
differences over the issue of trade and customs duties. 
  [Begin Quray' recording] We have made some progress on 
banking and financial issues but we are having a real dispute 
over trade and customs duties. I wish to point out that, first 
of all, a new reality has come into being and we must handle 
issues on the basis of this. The Palestinian territory cannot 
remain in the same condition during the transitional period as 
it was during the occupation phase. A new reality exists that 
should apply to all spheres of activity, be they political, 
economic, or social. This is the new reality. Another issue is 
the following: According to the Declaration of Principles there 
will be economic cooperation with Israel but the Palestinians 
will continue to have strategic economic relations with their 
larger Arab homeland. Israel must understand the Palestinian 
trade relationship with the Arab homeland. The Palestinians 
must make their own decisions on this matter. A third area of 
dispute is connected with our determination to decide the level 
of customs duties and taxes to be imposed on economic 
development projects. We must also be the only authority to 
determine how much tax is paid on certain basic commodities.

<F P=106> [Report on interviews with the PLO's UN Observer Nasir </F>
al-Qudwah, and Israeli UN Ambassador Gad Ya'aqobi, by Antoine 
'Awn and Fatimah Benhuhu, conducted via satellite link between 
London and New York on 7 March--recorded; Ya'aqobi speaks 
English with superimposed Arabic translation] 
  [Text] Despite the U.S. assurances to Dr. Nabil Sha'th 
regarding their initial approval of international protection for 
the Palestinians, PLO Observer at the United Nations Nasir 
al-Qudwah told MBC Television a short time ago that disagreement 
continues with the United States about certain points in the 
draft resolution. The PLO had announced in a statement made by 
President Yasir 'Arafat that there will be no return to the 
negotiations before the Security Council issues a resolution 
guaranteeing the Palestinian civilians' protection and the 
disarming of the settlers. 
  Nasir al-Qudwah answered questions we posed to him during a 
conversation conducted via satellite link tonight. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Qudwah] As far we are concerned, we 
are 
doing our utmost to ensure that a Security Council resolution is 
adopted as soon as possible. Later today there will be a 
meeting of the representatives of the Arab group and the Islamic 
group with the same aim, namely to ensure that the Security 
Council acts swiftly to adopt a resolution. I still have no 
information and therefore cannot be sure of the exact time when 
this will happen. We hope it will occur very soon, if not today 
then tomorrow, God willing. 
  ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, the Palestinians are demanding that 
the 
Security Council adopt a resolution providing for the protection 
of the Palestinians and disarming the settlers before the 
negotiations are resumed, as Mr. 'Arafat declared. What are the 
attitudes of the Security Council members to this Palestinian 
demand? 
  [Al-Qudwah] True, this is part of the Palestinian demands 
that we submitted at the start and to which we still totally 
adhere. The Security Council members are generally supportive 
of our demands, which they regard as just. Regrettably there 
were disagreements from the start with the U.S. delegation. We 
tried, however, through some hard negotiating last week, to find 
solutions acceptable to both parties. We have had some success 
but have not yet agreed on a final text. 
  ['Awn] Mr. al-Qudwah, Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke of a tentative 
U.S. approval of an international presence in the occupied 
territories. Why is a resolution being delayed, then? 
  [Al-Qudwah] There are still some points on which we did not 
reach agreement in our discussions with the U.S. delegation. 
These points include Jerusalem's legal status as part of the 
occupied Palestinian territory. This is a matter on which we 
can make no concessions whatsoever. Another point is the 
mechanism by which the implementation of the resolution will be 
followed up. As for the issue of international protection, we 
have succeeded in generally agreeing on the wording. In 
accordance with this, the United States has agreed to an 
international presence in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
[end recording] 
  MBC Television posed a question to Israel's representative 
at 
the United Nations Gad Ya'aqobi about Israel's reasons for 
hindering the adoption of a Security Council resolution on the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, particularly after it failed to 
protect the worshipers. 
  [Begin Ya'aqobi recording] We strongly support the Security 
Council meeting and a swift resolution because we believe that 
this issue must be dealt with and finished with so that the 
negotiations can be resumed and a decision made to implement the 
two parties' agreements, including the Cairo Agreement. [end 
recording] 
  Ya'aqobi affirmed that Israel does not oppose any steps to 
protect the Palestinians, but he said he believes that the 
quickest way to provide this protection is by resuming the 
negotiations so that a Palestinian police force can be 
established to carry out its tasks in cooperation with the 
Israeli forces, as he put it. He repeated that Israel has 
accepted the principle of an international presence in the 
occupied territories and noted that this phrase will be included 
in the resolution which the Security Council will issue. He 
stated, however, that Israel will not agree to renegotiating the 
Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement, warning that 
this would only hinder the talks and obstruct the implementation 
of the agreements.

  [Text] Amman -- Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid has stated that the Arab League foreign ministers 
will meet at its headquarters on 26 March to discuss the Arab 
boycott of Israel, an issue which the Arab League constantly 
keeps on its agenda. He stressed that the ministers will 
discuss the direct and indirect boycott and make the appropriate 
decision on the issue. 
  In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR yesterday, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid said that the ministers will also discuss amending 
the Arab League Charter by introducing supplements to bring it 
in line with the current circumstances, changes, and 
developments. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab League seeks with all 
its efforts and capabilities to achieve Arab reconciliation, and 
overcome the repercussions the Arab nation experiences in the 
wake of the Gulf crisis by raising the slogan of frankness 
before reconciliation. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that he summoned the representatives 
of the UN Security Council permanent and nonpermanent members to 
inform them about the Arab League denunciation and condemnation 
of the massacre in the blessed Irahimi Mosque, and asked them to 
appeal to their countries and governments to take steps to 
immediately have the UN Security Council issue a resolution 
condemning the massacre and providing protection for the 
Palestinians. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, 
Arab League assistant secretary general, and head of the Arab 
League mission to Yemen, phoned him yesterday to brief him on 
the efforts he is undertaking to settle the Yemeni crisis. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that Maj Gen Bayraqdar will leave for 
Aden today, Monday to meet Vice President 'ali Salim al-Bid, 
after which he will return to Sanaa to meet with Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to exchange views on how to 
settle the differences between the Yemeni brothers.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir </F>
'Arafat, in Tunis, by David Frost, in the studio on 6 
March--recorded; from the "Frost on Sunday" program] 
  [Text] [Frost] Do you blame the Israeli military for taking 
part in the massacre in Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] It was clear [words indistinct] that this massacre 
cannot be done without the help and the cover of some Israeli 
units, who according to everybody information and it is known 
for everybody that the mosque in Hebron is completely under the 
protection and the supervision of the Israeli Army units and all 
its gates and around it, no, and I have the right to ask how 
this gang had the ability to enter this mosque with these 
armorments and in the same time these units open their fire 
against these people who were escaping from the mosque from 
outside and some of them -- about eight have been killed and 24 
have been injured in front of the mosque. 
  [Frost] But Mr. Chairman I know how much you believe in 
peace 
of the brave, you cannot let, you musn't let surely one madman, 
one madman end these talks? 
  ['Arafat] There were not one, but between 10 and 12, and for 
your information the persons who were being killed inside the 
mosque and being injured, about 322 some of them had received 
more than seven bullets. 
  [Frost] What is the next move Mr. Chairman if talks are to 
start again? 
  ['Arafat] We have to wait and see what is going in the 
Security Council and we are waiting for a stronger resolution, 
we are in need of a quick move from the [word indistinct] 
especially from the Clinton Administration. 
  [Frost] Have you spoken to President Clinton since the 
massacre? 
  ['Arafat] I haven't had the ability to speak [word 
indistinct] but have had the opportunity to [talk with] Mr. 
Christopher. 
  [Frost] And what did he say to you? 
  ['Arafat] He promised me that he would do all his best in 
the 
Security Council to have a stronger resolution. 
  [Frost] How many military observers to you think you need to 
see in the West Bank and in Gaza? 
  ['Arafat] I am not asking for the moon, I am asking for 
something suitable and convenient. 
  [Frost] Do you feel that what this massacre did was also to 
increase the support for the extreme Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] movement and make life more difficult for the PLO? 
  ['Arafat] They have the right to ask me -- not only Hamas -- 
everybody has the right to ask me, this is the peace [words 
indistinct] and I have the right ask the [word indistinct] and 
especially President Clinton is this the peace which I have 
signed in Washington? 
  [Frost] When do you think those peace talks will start 
again? 
  ['Arafat] You can't go to the tango, and dance the tango 
alone, you have to ask the other sides who are still maneuvering 
to try to avoid the accurate and honest implementation of what 
had been signed and agreed upon. 
  [Frost] If Israel is ready to tango as well, the Americans 
will provide the music in Washington. 
  ['Arafat] The music in Washington, but first of all is there 
a will? if there is no will there is no way, if there is a will 
there is a way, otherwise all of us will lose, not me 
personally, not me as a Palestinian people, because peace is not 
only a Palestinian need, it's a Palestinian need, Israeli need, 
Arab need, inter-Arabian need, American need, international need. 
  [Frost] But I mean in our conversation at Christmas, just 
before in December you said when I asked you if you trust Prime 
Minister Rabin and you said yes, do you still trust him, do you? 
  ['Arafat] I am sorry to say I will have to wait and see how 
after this delay of this implementation of what is [word 
indistinct] upon I have to wait and see, it seems that he is 
following the advice of this extremist Israeli Army. 
  [Frost] So when do you expect to be sitting in your office 
in 
Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] Sorry, in the past I was imagining that the other 
side was going to implement accurately and honestly what was 
agreed upon. Now I am sorry to say I cannot give you the answer 
for this question, sorry to say. 
  [Frost] Is the PLO weaker as a result of this massacre? 
  ['Arafat] The moment is not the PLO all the people [word 
indistinct] have lost its credibility, not only before the 
massacre but after the massacre, it became clear and obvious, 
that this process had lost its credibility completely. 
  [Frost] Well this is a major, a major change from the 
optimistic Yasir 'Arafat of ten days ago. 
  ['Arafat] I am a pragmatic man, I am not dealing with 
dreams, 
I am dealing with realities and fact. 
  [Frost] Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by unidentified </F>
correspondent; place and date not given: "We Are Cousins"] 
  [Text] [FOCUS] The Hebron massacre has weakened the peace 
process. Will it survive the crisis? 
  ['Arafat] The peace process has been interrupted. I would 
like to stress that it has been interrupted and not broken off. 
We hope that President Clinton will save the situation. 
  [FOCUS] What measures do you expect Clinton to adopt? 
  ['Arafat] Clinton should support the resolution on 
international presence that we submitted to the United Nations. 
It is included in the Declaration of Principles (DOP). The DOP 
should be fulfilled in the interest of our people. Clinton must 
exert pressure to ensure the disarmament of the Israeli 
extremists in the occupied territories. Finally, the Israeli 
Government must clarify the role of the army in the massacre. 
  [FOCUS] Do you believe Rabin when he says that he wants to 
clear up the attack? 
  ['Arafat] I believe that Rabin will take corresponding 
measures if Clinton asks him to do so. Otherwise, I would be 
skeptical. Rabin must do everything possible to ensure the 
security of the Palestinian people. 
  [FOCUS] Thus, you are not demanding the abandonment of all 
settlements? 
  ['Arafat] We are not demanding heaven on earth. We know 
Israel and the Israelis. We are cousins. We know them very 
well. There is no doubt that some settlers are fanatical. The 
Israeli Government must take measures against them because the 
fanatics want to undermine the peace process and to kill 
Palestinians. 
  [FOCUS] How do you assess the chances for peace, leaving the 
massacre out of consideration? 
  ['Arafat] The truth is that the Israelis do not want to 
implement the results of the negotiations. Rabin stated: 
"'Arafat should sweat." And then the massacre occurred. 
  [FOCUS] What will now happen? 
  ['Arafat] If the peace process should be stopped, and if 
Israel does not ensure the security of my people, a 
Balkanization will take place, and the Middle East will shake.

  [Text] Sources in the PLO leadership have said they 
believe that an Israeli delegation will arrive in Tunis to meet 
with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat within a day or two. The 
sources said that the delegation will be headed by a minister 
close to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The sources in the PLO 
leadership said that the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat and 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in Cairo was positive; however, 
it is still too early to talk of resuming the negotiations. 
Moti Amir, our correspondent in Tunis, reports that the PLO 
leadership feels that some tentative progress has been made 
toward resuming the talks with Israel. For the time being, 
however, no date has been set for their resumption. 
  Consultations were held at the prime minister's bureau last 
night within the framework of the efforts to resume the talks 
with the PLO. The participants analyzed the messages that 
arrived from the PLO yesterday. Shlomo Raz, our political 
correspondent, reports that the messages were delivered via 
direct and indirect contacts between the Prime Minister's 
Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and PLO elements in the territories and in Tunis. Among 
those attending yesterday's consultations were Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, and 
senior IDF officers, headed by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi, head of 
the Palestinian delegation in the Civilian Affairs Committee of 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, has stressed that there is 
a consensus among the Palestinian people on the need to protect 
themselves from the Israeli practices and the Israeli settlers' 
oppression until the Palestinian people get their legitimate 
rights, including the right to self-determination. 
  In a statement to MENA, al-Tarifi said today that the 
Israeli 
forces have arrested 1,000 Palestinians since the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre in Hebron while announcing the release of 800 
Palestinian detainees. 
  Al-Tarifi denounced the repressive Israeli measures, noting 
that the Palestinian people have been living under a security 
cordon imposed on them for 10 days now and that schools and 
shops are closed as a result of the curfew imposed on the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
  He said that the Palestinians could not perform Friday 
prayers last week in al-Aqsa Mosque, where thousands usually 
pray especially during the month of Ramadan, due to the 
arbitrary Israeli closure of al-Aqsa Mosque to all worshipers 
and visitors. 
  He added that a mood of despair and disappointment prevails 
among the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and 
even among the Palestinians of 1948 [Israeli Arabs]. 
  He stressed that the resumption of the negotiations process 
with Israel should take into account the new developments, 
because the Israelis have always spoken about guarantees of 
their own security but the recent massacre shows that it is the 
Palestinian people who need protection. 
  He said that the Israeli settlers are the ones threatening 
the peace process, not the Palestinian organizations. 
  Al-Tarifi, who resides in Jerusalem, came to Cairo to meet 
with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who earlier today 
ended a one day visit to Cairo.

  [Excerpt] Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, deputy 
head of the Palestinian delegation and chairman of the Security 
Committee in the self-rule negotiations, has said that "a 
meeting will be held in Cairo this week between President 
'Arafat and the Palestinian delegation to the self-rule 
negotiations to assess the most recent phase of negotiations and 
lay the main guidelines for a new negotiating strategy." 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y in Amman one hour 
before 
departing for Cairo yesterday morning, Maj. Gen. al-Yahya added 
that "in view of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, it has been 
necessary to reconsider the Palestinian negotiating strategy." 
He said that "suspending the negotiations does not mean ending 
them but temporarily stopping them to conduct a comprehensive 
study in light of recent developments, reports by the 
Palestinian envoys in Paris, London, and Washington, and a 
possible Security Council resolution." 
  Maj. Gen. al-Yahya, who was commander-in-chief of the 
Palestine Liberation Army, added that "negotiations are the only 
way to achieve the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area, but we need new concepts." 
  Asked about moving the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to 
Washington, al-Yahya said that "the main factor is not the venue 
of negotiations but the real attitude toward implementing the 
Declaration of Principles without any obstacles, particularly on 
the part of the Israeli side." He added that "moving the 
negotiations to Washington poses no problem for the Palestinian 
side. If the negotiations resume, we hope that the final 
results will be achieved in the shortest possible time." 
  Al-Yahya revealed that "the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
deferred 
an "urgent meeting" which the Palestinian-Israeli Security 
Coordination Committee was about to hold to explore the Israeli 
withdrawal and make arrangements for the Palestinian police 
entry to the Jericho area and Gaza Strip and their deployment 
and duties." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nicosia -- In his first reaction to the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, former head of the 
Palestinian negotiating delegation, has said that this ugly and 
criminal act reminds one of previous and repeated massacres to 
which the Palestinian people have been subjected in Dayr Yasin, 
Kafr Qasim, the al-Aqsa Mosque, Qibya, and Nahalin. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi was speaking by phone with AL-QUDS from 
Nicosia, where he is visiting at present in response to an 
invitation to attend an international conference of churches 
after paying a visit to South Africa. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added that a good solution cannot be 
reached except with the removal of Israeli settlements from the 
heart of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Settlements are the main 
obstacle to the achievement of a lasting peace in the region on 
the basis of UN resolutions. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi called on the Palestinian leadership to 
suspend 
the talks and reassess the current Palestinian situation 
entirely on a democratic basis. This would ensure the unity of 
the Palestinian position inside and outside by mobilizing all 
Palestinian potentials and defining the effective options 
available to the Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [Second part of interview with Faruq Qaddumi, head of the </F>
PLO Political Department, by Sa'id al-Gharrawi and 'Ali Husayn 
in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] What is the significance of 
the PLO-Jordanian economic agreement that you have signed? 
  [Qaddumi] The economic life of the Jordanian and Palestinian 
peoples is a joint economic and social life. There is no way we 
can separate the aspects of these two peoples who have common 
interests in all spheres. We must strengthen these interests 
and create institutions capable of protecting them so that they 
will stand up against all the challenges that will face us in 
the future and that will try to devour the Palestinian economy. 
  The agreement with Jordan and the one with Egypt seek to 
strengthen the Palestinian economic infrastructure and depend on 
the Arab parties and international aid to build a growing and 
independent Palestinian economy capable of freeing itself from 
Israel's grip. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Don't you think there is a 
contradiction in the course of Palestinian planning between the 
economic appendices of the Oslo agreement and the 
Jordanian-Palestinian agreement? 
  [Qaddumi] This contradiction has not surfaced so far. We 
have agreed with Jordan on several economic aspects but have not 
reached any agreement with Israel, even though the economic 
appendices provide for cooperation in all spheres. We view this 
cooperation by our own concept, which is cooperation to free 
ourselves from the Israeli economy, in a basic way. This will 
ensure peace in the region. But if Israel wants to swallow up 
the Palestinian economy, peace will not be established. 
Israel's attempts at economic containment will fail, no matter 
what. 
  Therefore, we are against customs cooperation with Israel. 
They have their own customs system, which is suitable to their 
advanced Israeli society. We also have our own customs system. 
However, there can be understanding on the import of goods from 
abroad. 
  Undoubtedly, this course will protect the peace process and 
put it on a sound and correct path. If Israel tries to impose 
its will on economic matters, we will absolutely reject its 
measures. As I have stated, Palestine's economic life is tied 
to fraternal Jordan's economic life. There is no way we can 
ignore this fact but we must strengthen these economic ties. 
Our people live on the two banks and our Jordanian people are 
part of us. We have passed through a successful unity 
experiment. We cannot distinguish between a Palestinian and a 
Jordanian. The two people have common interests and ties that 
must be strengthened. 
  As for economic relations with Israel, I clearly say: We 
will not allow the Israeli finance minister to decide which 
goods must pay customs fees. If there is a need to change the 
customs system or to alter the customs tariff on a certain 
commodity, we will do it. 
  This is our stand, which is sound. No one can compel us to 
accept a unified customs system. In addition, the import 
policies are not uniform in the world. Each country has its own 
policy. If we take into account the low standard of living in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the customs tariff imposed on 
imported goods cannot be similar to the customs tariff imposed 
in Israel. In short, Israel has its own system and we have our 
own system, which is considerably similar to the Jordanian 
customs system. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Occasionally, it looks as if 
Palestinian-Jordanian relations pass through difficult periods. 
We have seen Jordanian statements criticizing the PLO's weak 
coordination with Jordan. What is the truth about these 
relations and what is their present status? 
  [Qaddumi] The slogan of coordination between Jordan and 
Palestine is raised by both sides but coordination has not 
reached the level that we or our brothers in Jordan want. The 
obstacles to the implementation of the agreement confirm and do 
not preclude the need to strengthen this coordination. This 
coordination must result in a broad plan of understanding 
between us and our brothers in Jordan. This led to the signing 
of the first economic agreement and then the second economic 
agreement, which includes many matters mentioned in the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The second agreement covers all 
aspects of life--administrative, security, and economic aspects, 
as well as displaced people, refugees, borders, legislative 
affairs, and laws. 
  Hence, we have actually begun following the correct course 
for coordination and cooperation that we should have followed a 
long time ago. 
  I do not say which side is to blame. We were all busy with 
the peace process. When the proper time came to consolidate 
this coordination and cooperation, we began holding intensified 
meetings at the highest level (ministerial level) and drafted 
the terms of this coordination. The committees began to work. 
A few days ago, the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Political 
Committee held a meeting in Amman and reached agreement on most 
of the tasks of the committees that we have formed and appointed. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] There has been talk about 
establishing a Palestinian central bank as a symbol of 
Palestinian sovereignty and as preparatory groundwork for 
building a state. But looking into the articles of the 
agreement with Jordan we see that the task of this bank has been 
given to the Jordanian Central Bank. 
  [Qaddumi] This is not absolutely correct. The 
Jordanian-Palestinian accord referred to an agreement of the PLO 
and Jordan to reopen the Jordanian banks that existed before 
Israel's occupation of the West Bank and this responsibility 
extended to cover the Gaza Strip. We accepted this and said 
that the Jordanian Central Bank will supervise these Jordanian 
banks that have branches in the West Bank. 
  There is a joint technical and fiscal committee that 
supervises the tasks and responsibilities of the Jordanian 
Central Bank. On the one hand, the Jordanian Central Bank 
oversees these banks and, on the other hand, there is a joint 
Palestinian-Jordanian technical committee that receives a full 
report from the central bank after frequent inspections and 
supervision of the aforementioned Jordanian banks. This 
practice will continue until a Palestinian monetary authority 
has been established. When such an authority is established, it 
will assume all the responsibilities; in other words, the 
functions of the Jordanian Central Bank will cease after a 
Palestinian monetary authority is established. 
  We know perfectly well that when talking about Jordan or 
Palestine, we do not talk about different states but of our 
concern as one team for the joint interests of these two nations 
who live on the two banks and in Gaza. 
  Hence the Jordanian-Palestinian accord is the pinnacle of 
coordination and cooperation between the brothers in Palestine 
and Jordan. Then came subsequent agreement to enhance this 
cooperation with our brothers in Jordan. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] And what about the agreement with 
Egypt? 
  [Qaddumi] We also signed an economic agreement with Egypt to 
help us develop our economy inside the occupied territories. 
The agreement stipulates Egypt's right to open branches of its 
banks in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. All this is aimed at 
investment, transferring capitals, developing the Palestinian 
economy, and building its infrastructure. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Do you believe that the U.S.-Syrian 
summit will have a positive impact on the Syrian-Israeli 
negotiating track, which could delay any progress on the 
Palestinian track? 
  [Qaddumi] I disagree with those who hold this opinion 
because 
any progress on the Palestinian track helps advance the Syrian 
track and vice versa. Any progress on the Syrian track helps 
advance the Palestinian and other Arab tracks. 
  We wish the best for Syria if it progresses in its 
negotiations with Israel, and we support sisterly Syria in its 
negotiating process to achieve its national rights. That is why 
I said at the beginning that the Syrians will not sign a deal 
before the Palestinians do. There was a mutual agreement at the 
ministerial coordination meetings that genuine progress in the 
negotiations has to be made on the Palestinian track because 
there are differences between this track and other Arab tracks. 
That is to say, we are first negotiating over a transition 
phase that we want to finish and then will move on to 
negotiating the final phase. This transition phase does not 
exist on the other Arab tracks, on which the delegations 
negotiate only the final phase. 
  So any progress on the Syrian track will serve the 
Palestinian track because this means that Israel will withdraw 
from the Golan and south Lebanon. This helps us because 
everyone agrees that a final solution must be reached 
simultaneously, and all the Arab parties should sign a 
comprehensive peace deal on the same day. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Despite the coordination and 
agreements 
you mentioned, Syria continues to deliver sharp criticism 
against every Palestinian move toward a transitional solution 
that you mentioned. What is your comment? 
  [Qaddumi] Not only Syria criticized these moves; I was one 
of 
those who criticized them. We admit there are flaws in the 
Palestinian-Israeli accord and the Palestinians criticized the 
Cairo agreement. Regrettably, the Israelis placed one option 
before us. This does not mean that it was an acceptable option, 
but rather an option imposed on us because we want to advance 
this process to return our land. 
  What distinguishes the negotiations on the Palestinian track 
is that we are trying to enable our displaced people to receive 
their land. The point is that our people should live on their 
land not that we should just retake our land. The issue centers 
on the Palestinian refugees' return to their land; there is no 
such issue on the other Arab tracks. This is our basic concern 
and such issues and concerns do not exist on other tracks. 
  Therefore, we often sacrifice other issues to guarantee our 
nation's return to its land; afterward, the nation can undo the 
shackles, with which the Israeli occupation tied it. 
  Actually, this is the main difference between us and the 
Arab 
tracks. No matter how long the negotiations on the Arab tracks 
take, they do not have much effect on the Palestinian track. We 
want to halt the settlements and want the enemy to withdraw from 
every inch of our land so that the enemy will not build more 
settlements. 
  The presence of our people there puts an end to settlement. 
It also makes it hard for waves of settlers to come to our 
Palestinian land. This is because the implementation of the 
agreement means Israel has no right after today to build any 
settlement on the Palestinian territory, despite its 
paramilitary presence on this territory. Also, the presence of 
our people on their land will put us in a stronger position to 
prevent the building of new settlements because the Israeli 
objective is to absorb the Palestinian land. The Israeli 
extremists and the fanatic Zionists in the world, particularly 
in the United States, claim that the Palestinian land is a 
disputed territory. As for the Golan, everybody admits that it 
is part of Syria, and the same goes for south Lebanon, which is 
recognized as part of Lebanon. So we are struggling to give the 
Palestinian identity to this land and force an Israeli 
acknowledgement that this land is Palestinian and, thereafter, 
it would be impermissible to establish any settlements on it. 
This is what the Arabs must understand when talking about the 
transitional period, in which things get mixed up, criticisms 
and queries increase, and the question is often asked: Why do 
the Palestinians accept this or that matter? As I have stated 
once, we are facing tough choices and the majority of the 
Palestinian leadership opted for the lesser evil, particularly 
following the Malta summit between U.S. President George Bush 
and then Soviet President Gorbachev. At this summit, they 
agreed to bring thousands of Russian immigrants into Palestinian 
land. The Baghdad Arab summit studied the new situation to 
protect the Palestinian land from being swallowed. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Did the Syrian leadership understand 
the Palestinian motives? 
  [Qaddumi] The details of the Palestinian position 
demonstrate 
that we have a clear-cut strategy, and the Arabs realize it. 
However, they cannot back what we too are criticizing. What we 
have accepted is a choice imposed on us. We are struggling to 
gain more rights for our people so that they may have full 
sovereignty over their territory. The Arab brothers are trying 
to avoid discrepancies between the Palestinian track and the 
other Arab tracks. That is, they want the Syrian track to be 
similar to the Palestinian track. But the fact is it cannot be 
similar to the Palestinian track, because the facts regarding 
the Palestinian track are different from those of the Syrian or 
Lebanese tracks. We too back Syria and Lebanon when they say 
that the tracks are different and that a solution cannot be 
similar in all tracks. However, a solution must involve a 
comprehensive, explicit, and clear withdrawal and the removal of 
settlements. We are moving inch by inch on the Palestinian 
track to ultimately achieve these goals, but the methods we use 
may differ from those of the other tracks. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You mention the question of removing 
the settlements, but there is no text that explicitly refers to 
the removal of settlements or even to a halt to building 
activity. 
  [Qaddumi] The political settlement is based on international 
legality; that is, "land for peace." The definition of land is 
that we must enjoy sovereignty over it. Thus, an Israeli 
settlement built on Palestinian land cannot remain. But how can 
it be removed? This is the question that we have to solve. When 
and how? In addition, the Security Council resolutions rule 
that these settlements are illegitimate and must be removed, and 
Israel must remove them because the final solution, as 
stipulated in the agreement, must comply with Security Council 
Resolution 242. This resolution calls for Israel's withdrawal 
from the Palestinian territory, a just solution to the question 
of Palestinian refugees, and the inadmissibility of seizing 
others' territory by force. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Doesn't Brother Abu-al-Lutf [Qaddumi] 
believe that making progress on the Palestinian track, with 
tangible deadlocks on the other tracks, is a success for the 
Israeli strategy of creating a schism in the Arab front and 
separating the tracks? 
  [Qaddumi] In fact, separate negotiations with each Arab 
party 
have been going on since the Madrid conference, but the Arabs 
are negotiating while coordinating among themselves. From the 
start, the PLO has sought to achieve this Arab coordination and 
cooperation in the negotiations. We tried to break the ice 
between us and Syria and started to coordinate with it; the same 
is true of Lebanon. We also straightened out our relations with 
Egypt, which in turn started to undertake its pan-Arab duties in 
the best possible way. This means that inter-Arab coordination 
proceeded well until the Oslo agreement; the fault here lies not 
with the Palestinians but with U.S. President Clinton. When I 
and brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] met President Hafiz 
al-Asad in Damascus and handed him a copy of the agreement he 
said: We will study it, but we have some observations. We will 
not say that we are either for or against this agreement, but we 
will say that the Palestinian institutions, the PLO, and the 
Palestinian people are responsible for accepting or rejecting 
this agreement. In the meantime, we will give you some 
observations. Later, we were surprised to see that President 
Clinton insisted on the need to sign the agreement on 13 
September. brother Abu-'Ammar tried to postpone the signing 
ceremony but it was a date imposed on us. This is what made 
brother Abu-'Ammar, in the end, go to Washington to sign the 
agreement. But the truth is that it was neither brother 
Abu-'Ammar's intention, nor the intention of the other brothers, 
to sign the agreement on that date because we were waiting for 
the observations promised by the brothers in Syria, Lebanon, and 
Jordan. The mistake of the U.S. President and his 
administration was that they hurried the signing on 13 September 
to tell the world that the United States had made an important 
accomplishment in the Middle East. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Could this U.S. behavior be 
interpreted as a lack of interest in the facts about the region 
or a U.S. attempt to harm inter-Arab ties? 
  [Qaddumi] This interpretation cannot be adopted. In my view, 
the United States at the time was going through a difficult 
economic crisis. It was said at the time President Clinton was 
reluctant to make crucial decisions. Thus, a political 
accomplishment was needed to improve the ratings of the U.S. 
Administration. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] We notice a U.S. tendency not to 
intervene in the Palestinian-Israeli talks. Do you expect the 
U.S. Administration to make a ceremonial act like it did in 
September? 
  [Qaddumi] The United States is the primary sponsor of this 
process and cannot abandon its responsibilities to bring the 
views closer, promote the peace process, and put pressure on the 
parties concerned, particularly Israel, which shows 
intransigence. Without this, the peace process will not work. 
If the United States gives up acting as an unbiased sponsor 
this process will stumble. Unless real accomplishment is made 
on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks, the peace process will 
stumble entirely. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But how can we talk about an unbiased 
U.S. role when U.S. officials do not let any opportunity pass 
without emphasizing their commitment to Israel's qualitative 
superiority over the Arab states? 
  [Qaddumi] The United States always raises the claim that it 
is "an impartial sponsor". So it has to act in this way; that 
is, by making the peace process succeed in accordance with 
former President Bush's initiative in March 1991, which 
contained the principle of "land for peace," the recognition of 
the Palestinian people's political rights, and the 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 242 as a basis for 
a settlement. Judging by the promises it made to Israel, we 
knew from the start that the United States, particularly this 
administration, is biased. However, as time went by it started 
to realize that this bias would not serve peace in the region 
and that it had to be more sensitive to things that serve peace. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] Can we talk about a normalization in 
Palestinian-Gulf relations following the visit of brother 
Abu-'Ammar to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with the Saudi 
monarch? 
  [Qaddumi] Brother Abu-'Ammar's visit to Saudi Arabia and the 
visits of other Palestinian delegations to the Gulf states 
earlier were not only an attempt to normalize Palestinian-Gulf 
ties. On the contrary, they were attempts toward full 
inter-Arab reconciliation. We set up and participated in the 
committee formed by the Arab League to achieve Arab 
reconciliation. Without this reconciliation, the Arab position 
will remain weak. There must be reconciliation among all Arab 
members of the Arab League and an Arab charter must be drafted 
that clearly defines inter-Arab ties and their future. Thus, the 
Palestinian delegations' visits to the Arab states or the Gulf 
serve Arab purposes. They seek to create an appropriate 
atmosphere not only to serve the peace process, but also Arab 
reconciliation, which Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd- al-Majid is exerting strenuous efforts to achieve. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Oslo agreement did not contain a 
clear-cut and explicit clause about the return of the displaced 
persons. It looked as if the PLO had abandoned a legitimate 
right recognized by Security Council Resolution 437, which 
stipulated the right of the displaced persons to unconditionally 
return to their lands. Doesn't this sound logical? 
  [Qaddumi] This is incorrect. A reference to the displaced 
persons of 1967 exists in the Oslo Agreement. A quadripartite 
Palestinian-Jordanian-Israeli-Egyptian committee must be set up 
during the interim period. These displaced persons number more 
than 760,000. As for the refugees, the agreement mentioned that 
negotiations must be held to discuss their problem after the end 
of the second year of the transitional period. Also, the 
refugees committee of the multilateral talks is discussing this 
question although Israel remains intransigent and rejects 
Resolution 194, which stipulated the right of the Palestinian 
refugees from 1948 to return to their homes or, for those who do 
not want to return, to be compensated. Thus, negotiations 
between us and Israel over the refugees have been put off for 
two years, but this does not mean that we are not raising this 
issue in all international forums, in the UN General Assembly, 
in international conferences, and in bilateral relations. All 
efforts focus on the need to get Israel to recognize in 
principle the Palestinians' right to return to their homes in 
accordance with Resolution 194. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But, Brother Abu-al-Lutf, the recent 
"Cairo agreement" spoke about "residents" whose names are 
registered in the records of the Israeli authorities and about 
"visitors" of the Palestinian territory. It did not touch on 
the question of the displaced persons? 
  [Qaddumi] The Cairo agreement is, one way or another, an 
annex to the Oslo agreement. It talks about who should and 
should not enter the Palestinian territory in the coming stage. 
As for the displaced persons, there are clear provisions about 
them in the agreement. As I said, a quadripartite committee 
(from Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt) will be formed to 
define the rules for their return; there is no room for argument 
about this. As for the refugees, they must not return to Gaza 
and Jericho but to their homes in Yafo, Haifa, the Galilee, etc. 
In other words, they must return to the places from which they 
were evicted. If they want to go as visitors to the West Bank 
and Gaza, they have the right to, but Israel must be informed if 
these persons will visit their relatives for one or two months 
and, in such case, they would have a visitor status. As for the 
question of their return, they must return to the places from 
which they were previously evicted. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] You recently took part in a 
ministerial meeting of the Nonaligned Movement in Jakarta. What 
is your view of the movement's role and actions now that the 
Cold War is over, and how important is that role? 
  [Qaddumi] The end of the international struggle that was 
called "the Cold War" has brought the nonaligned countries 
closer together. During the international struggle between the 
two superpowers, some of these countries were affected by the 
political stands of and received economic aid from one of the 
sides. As a result of these conditions in some nonaligned 
countries, differences arose within the movement. But following 
the end of the third world war (the Cold War), the developed 
countries started to have an almost identical view of these 
countries because interests that led to a rapprochement with 
them have disappeared. 
  Hence, the big powers began to treat many nonaligned 
countries similarly. They started to feel that they were close 
to these countries and that their interests are identical and 
intertwined. The nonaligned countries began to feel the need to 
strengthen their solidarity in order to face the challenges 
presented by the developed countries. The struggle has in fact 
become more of an economic one than a political one. Therefore, 
we can say that the objective conditions are now present for the 
nonaligned countries to increase their cooperation on a regional 
basis, after which they will move toward comprehensive 
cooperation within the Nonaligned Movement's framework, because 
all these countries are in the south and in a struggle with the 
countries of the north to obtain technology and reduce their 
debts and the interest and services imposed on these debts. 
  As we know, all the nonaligned countries have similar 
conditions and stands toward the major powers. Each one of 
these countries produces one or two commodities that are the 
basis of their economy. The developed countries in the north are 
trying to control the price of these commodities while the price 
of the developed countries' industrial goods are constantly 
rising. This creates an imbalance in the nonaligned countries' 
economic structure and makes them rally together to repel the 
dangers created by the developed countries' economic and trade 
policies. 
  Hence, the struggle between north and south in all branches 
of the economic sphere will intensify. This will double the 
importance of solidarity among the nonaligned countries to 
confront the challenges imposed by the differences between the 
north and south. 
  The Nonaligned Movement has become more important now than 
in 
the past because it affects the life of the citizen and his 
social and economic wellbeing, which in turn affect the 
political situation in these countries that are in dire need for 
political stability. 
  We have seen a number of unstable political situations that 
resulted from the economic imbalance and troublesome debts of 
these countries. From this comes the importance of cooperation 
among the nonaligned countries, because the developed world is 
exploiting them regardless of their geographical positions or 
political stands. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] But does not brother Abu-al-Lutf 
believe that the name "Nonaligned Movement" has become a relic 
of the past and that current conditions demand that it be 
changed? 
  [Qaddumi] There is no need to change the name. We discussed 
this issue at length at the movement's conferences and it was 
decided to keep it, that is "the Nonaligned Movement", as an 
international movement. 
  [FILASTIN AL-THAWRAH] The Palestinian-Israeli conflict 
entered a new phase on 13 September 1993. What is the scope of 
this conflict? 
  [Qaddumi] The tools of the conflict will be political and 
social, in addition to foreign pressure. It will be a race of 
economic development and there will be serious attempts to 
organize Palestinian society so that it will be capable of 
facing the challenges of building and developing our 
institutions, training qualified cadres, finding all the honest 
means to enable every citizen to live a dignified life, and 
modernizing our institutions to absorb the developed societies' 
technological and scientific advances.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi has criticized 
recent Israeli measures and said that they address the form not 
the content and are merely cosmetic steps that do not meet 
minimal requirements. 
  The former Palestinian negotiating delegation spokesperson 
stressed that the peace process is not an end by itself but a 
means for achieving a genuine and just peace. 'Ashrawi said 
that the horrible massacre in Hebron illustrated the Israeli 
position's flaw in the negotiations. That position endeavors to 
separate the people from the land and impose the method of 
functional division instead of geographic jurisdiction. 
  'Ashrawi called for modifying the peace process, which is 
dominated by Israeli priorities that seek to impose hegemony and 
control rather than engage in real negotiations. 
  Regarding the way out from the current situation, Dr. 
'Ashrawi emphasized that it calls for total withdrawal from the 
negotiating process, but she believed that basic prerequisites 
had to be met before returning to the talks. 
  'Ashrawi listed those demands: Disarming the settlers, 
dismantling settlements in densely populated areas, and 
providing international protection for the Palestinian people. 
  'Ashrawi said that it has become essential to open the 
settlements' file. She added that the Declaration of Principles 
was not sacred, just as Israel has regarded its timetable not 
sacred. 
  'Ashrawi criticized the Palestinian leadership implicitly. 
She called for changing the negotiating approach and the 
Palestinian decisionmaking process. She also called on the 
leadership to be candid with the people and not downplay their 
capabilities and right to participate and question.

  [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Zakariya al-Agha, the Fatah official 
responsible for the Gaza Strip, has said that the release of a 
few hundred prisoners is insufficient and is a cosmetic move 
aimed only at deflecting the Palestinian people's anger and the 
international condemnation of the Hebron massacre. 
  Al-Agha added that if the Israeli Government wants to 
implement more positive measures, it should release all the 
Palestinian prisoners, without exception or discrimination. It 
should also reassess the settlement policy, disband the 
settlements in the occupied territories, and disarm the settlers. 
  Commenting on the Israeli Government's decisions in the wake 
of the massacre, al-Agha said: The Israeli Government's 
decisions are deficient. I do not believe that they will be 
effective in putting an end to the danger posed by the settlers 
and to their conduct and aggressions. He noted that the Israeli 
Government must address the issue of the settlements and 
settlers in a fundamental rather than a superficial way. 
  Regarding Fatah's position and intention to resume armed 
activities in response to the massacre, Dr. al-Agha said: I 
believe there was never a decision to stop armed activities. 
There was only a "truce" which the two sides were obliged to 
observe and respect. We now see that the Israeli side failed to 
abide by the truce and violated it several times. It is 
inconceivable for us to stand idly by in the face of these 
violations and remain committed to the truce. 
  Dr. al-Agha expressed the belief that conditions must be set 
for the resumption of the talks -- the most important being the 
disarming of all the settlers. Israel must also agree to 
disband the settlements and evacuate them from all the occupied 
territories. International protection should be provided for the 
Palestinian people until these two conditions are met. 
  Dr. al-Agha noted that the current situation necessitates 
the 
drafting of new formulas for the talks. He said that the 
Palestinian people support the suspension of the talks until the 
situation is reassessed and new conditions are set. These 
conditions must be accepted by Israel, because the negotiating 
climate and the circumstances that prevailed prior to the 
massacre have now changed. New realities have imposed 
themselves on the scene and should be addressed. Among these 
are the settlement issue, the Palestinian people's safety, and 
the settlers' aggressions. Therefore, these issues must be 
given top priority before the resumption of the talks is 
considered. 
  The Palestinian official stressed that international 
protection is not a substitute for removing the settlements; it 
is a temporary measure until all the settlements are removed. 
  Commenting on the positions taken by the United States and 
Western countries regarding the massacre, the Palestinian 
official expressed the belief that these positions were good but 
not enough. He noted that while they condemned this criminal 
act, condemnation alone is not enough and words must be 
translated into deeds. the way to do this is to support the 
Palestinian people's demands, which are their natural right. 
  Dr. al-Agha called on Palestinian national and Islamic 
forces 
to coordinate and close ranks. He said that this stage is 
crucial and critical for every Palestinian and that it is the 
duty of all Palestinian national and Islamic forces to engage in 
dialogue and seek the lowest common denominator for national 
unity.

  [Text] Dubayy, 6 Mar (MENA)--Press reports published here 
today said that the PLO leadership has asked the Fatah Movement 
leaders inside the occupied territories not to take any military 
action against Israeli targets at this time. 
  AL-BAYAN cited Palestinian sources as saying that this 
request came in the wake of reports that reached the Palestinian 
command that some of the armed Fatah members in the occupied 
territories are planning with elements from Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] to stage widespread acts of revenge in 
retaliation for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  On the other hand, the same paper cited Hamas sources in 
Amman, Jordan, as saying that the group has agreed not to take 
military action at present and limit itself to civil 
disobedience and popular rebellion. 
  The sources added that Hamas agreed to this on the 
conditions 
that it be for a limited period of time and that this agreement 
would come after the PLO command informed it that there is an 
imminent agreement with the United States to provide 
international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories.

  [Text] Well-informed sources in Washington yesterday said 
that the U.S. Government has formulated a plan to revive the 
Middle East peace process and resume the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations within a few weeks. The entire peace process has 
been jeopardized by the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The sources indicated that this plan is grounded in 
providing 
protection for the Palestinians of the occupied territories to 
entice the Arab sides back into the negotiations in early April. 
  News reports from Washington said that, with regard to 
protection for the Palestinians, the U.S. Government has 
formulated proposals on the measures that can be taken and 
announced in order to pacify the Palestinians of the occupied 
territories. The reports added that it is not unlikely that the 
United States will make an effort to persuade Israel to accept a 
reduced presence of unarmed international observers in the 
occupied territories as part of protection guarantees for the 
Palestinians in accordance with the provisions enshrined in the 
Declaration of Principles signed by the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides. 
  The U.S. sources asserted that the U.S. plan, which contains 
specific proposals, will be the focus of consultations to be 
held with the concerned parties within the next few days, 
particularly with [Israeli] Prime Minister Rabin, who is 
scheduled to visit the United States next week. 
  The sources noted that an outline of this plan was discussed 
by senior officials of the U.S. State Department and a PLO 
delegation headed by brother Dr. Nabil Sha'th during the 
meetings they held recently. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher yesterday. He also met with the U.S. team assigned 
the task of following up on the Middle East peace talks. 
  The sources pointed out that it is not unlikely that the 
consultations held in this regard will be continued with the 
concerned parties during a tour of the region by Dennis Ross in 
the second half of March. The sources went on to say that 
Christopher himself might undertake this mission if he finds 
that this is warranted to ensure the reactivation of the peace 
process and bring it back on track as soon as possible.

  [Text] Tunis, March 7 (AFP) -- Israel's decision to 
compensate victims of the Hebron massacre is an admission of 
official complicity in the killings and does not go far enough, 
the Palestinian news agency WAFA said Monday [7 March]. 
  "We are not demanding compensation, but effective 
international protection," the official news agency said. 
  The offer was "an admission of complicity" on the part of 
Israeli officials in the February 25 massacre, in which a Jewish 
settler gunned down dozens of Arab worshippers in a mosque, the 
agency said. 
  However, the PLO did not reject the compensation outright. 
  Israeli officials said Monday the victims of the Hebron 
mosque massacre or their relatives would receive up to 70,000 
dollars in compensation. 
  The military administration would make the payments based on 
a sliding scale worked out by the Finance Ministry, starting at 
8,500 dollars for a lightly wounded bachelor. 
  Relatives of the 30 Palestinians killed, according to the 
army's toll, would receive the same amount as survivors who were 
seriously hurt in the attack. 
  "The financial compensation...cannot settle the matter," 
WAFA 
said, adding that money "can never, no matter how large the 
amount, wipe away the blood, heal the wounds or conceal the 
tragedy." 
  PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat returned to the PLO's Tunis 
headquarters from Cairo Monday, following talks with Egyptian 
officials and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's political 
advisor Jacques Neriya. 
  Israeli diplomats in Cairo said Neria presented proposals 
aimed at clearing the way for resuming talks on implementing the 
September 13 accord on Palestinian self-rule. 
  The PLO suspended the talks after the Hebron massacre. 
  Palestinian sources in Tunis said 'Arafat was due to call a 
continuous session of his main Fatah faction to discuss progress 
made in the PLO's drive to secure international protection for 
the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  The PLO has also demanded the disarming of Jewish settlers 
and the dismantling of certain settlements. 
  'Arafat said Monday that negotiations could only resume once 
the UN Security Council had passed a resolution stipulating 
international protection for the Palestinians and the disarming 
of settlers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, secretary general of the </F>
Palestine Liberation Front, by Ahmad 'Abd-al-Majid, in Baghdad; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Majid] You were deeply saddened by 
pictures of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre you saw on 
television, and you stayed at home for two days, refusing to 
receive anyone. Is sorrow sufficient? Can a revolutionary 
stand idle, doing nothing, while his people are being killed 
before his eyes? 
  ['Abbas] Revolutionaries are full of emotions. I believe 
that it is normal to experience emotions first, before other 
values and reactions, including retaliation. Consequently, it 
is natural for any human being to become angry over such a 
massacre when he sees his people being brutally killed while 
they are performing their prayers. This affects us as human 
beings. [passage omitted] 
  The normal state of affairs during the stage of conflict is 
that we should expect losses, and the fall of martyrs. However, 
what saddens us in the face of such a massacre is the current 
political formulas, the stands that conflict with our real 
principles, and the current miserable Arab situation. Great 
sadness is a major tool for a consequent action. The men who 
were martyred, the children who were killed, and the widows who 
cried deserve balanced measures that will alleviate their 
suffering and prove that our determination is still strong to 
pursue struggle to terminate occupation and to achieve 
independence. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] You said consequent action. What is the 
nature of this action? Will you resort to another option other 
than the option of a political solution? 
  ['Abbas] Struggle is an integral and indivisible whole. 
However, any action necessitates a reaction, especially when you 
see your people being slaughtered. You must then look for an 
appropriate action. We have not relinquished armed struggle. 
As an organization, we still believe that armed struggle is a 
major tool to attain our people's rights in Palestine. 
Developments are escalating, and they are all related to what 
has taken place. We have great hope that God will grant us 
success and help us wipe away the tears of the widows and 
console the children who have lost their fathers and brothers. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Can our sadness console the victims? 
  ['Abbas] Sadness is not condolence, it is a human 
expression. 
The holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre makes us sad. The condolence 
in such a national cause is to make our people confident that 
armed struggle is still continuing, that the objectives for 
which martyrs fell and for which our people were exposed to such 
a massacre will not be forgotten, and that our people's blood 
will not melt away uselessly. The martyrs' blood must be a 
torch, granting the revolution further strength and lighting the 
road toward our goals. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The way you deal with the national 
Palestinian rights is to some extent similar to that of Hamas. 
Do you have contacts with this movement? 
  ['Abbas] As an organization, we have carried out armed 
struggle for more than a quarter of a century in a continuous 
manner that has left its imprint in the national, Arab, and 
international arenas. We have never been negligent in this 
field. Our vision has always been clear and it will remain so. 
Hamas and other organizations have similar ideas. In one way 
or another, we have contacts with the Palestinian forces that 
work within the national framework, regardless of their 
political stands. The closer their stands become to ours, the 
closer we become to these Palestinian organizations. 
  We view Hamas with special appreciation, and we have 
contacts 
with it. I say contacts and not an alliance. These contacts 
might be developed. This depends on how close our political 
stands become in the future regarding struggle in our homeland. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] But do not you see that there is a 
contradiction between armed struggle and political action within 
the PLO framework? 
  ['Abbas] This is an integration, not a contradiction. We are 
represented in the PLO and the PLO Executive Committee. We have 
developed relations with factions and forces that are outside 
the PLO framework. We also have relations with factions that 
left the PLO or that have adopted a certain stand toward the PLO 
leadership such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine. Our concept of integration is based on our reading 
of the PLO's current situation. In our opinion, the PLO still 
constitutes the moral entity of the people. In other words, it 
is the state of the Palestinians. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
U.S. President Bill Clinton called on the parties to the 
settlement to resume negotiations in Washington. In your 
opinion, why this hasty invitation? 
  ['Abbas] We should speak about the U.S. role, taking into 
consideration that America is the legitimate father of the 
current political settlement. In brief, we can say that the 
settlement is a U.S. settlement. We are aware of the changes 
and circumstances that have contributed to drawing the features 
of the stage that produced the so-called peace plan. Based on 
this, the United States must be very concerned about the success 
of its Middle Eastern plan, which is represented by the 
establishment of a regional Middle East complex in which Israel 
will be the center of gravity, because it has fateful ties with 
the United States. In light of the repercussions of the 
massacre, the U.S. President's invitation came as a quick 
reaction aimed at protecting whatever he can still protect of 
his programs in the region. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Do you have any advice for the PLO 
leadership? 
  ['Abbas] Everyday carries new evidence of the blind and 
erroneous political course -- its uselessness, the extent of the 
harm it has inflicted on our people and cause, and the losses 
which could have been averted if the PLO had redressed its 
course, especially since there are no signs or indications 
regarding substantive Israeli concessions. There were huge 
national losses, and the Israeli and American demands are 
pushing the PLO toward making still further concessions. In 
addition to this, repressive and oppressive measures are still 
continuing, and they were crowned by the Hebron massacre. The 
only advice I have to the PLO leadership is to leave, 
unhesitatingly, this quagmire that it has led our people into, 
before the catastrophe becomes complete. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The reason behind your relinquishment of 
your 
seat in the PLO Executive Committee is still unknown, why? 
  ['Abbas] My departure of the PLO Executive Committee was 
linked to my reading of the situation; the Gulf war and the 
PLO's political program paved the way for what has followed. It 
was my choice not to stay with the leadership dominating the 
PLO. As an expression of our commitment to the PLO, we 
nominated another comrade to replace me. [passage omitted] 
  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a different man than the one I 
used to know. He expresses aspirations and concerns differently 
from how he used to express then in the past. He speaks in a 
language that is not the traditional language of his 
revolutionary conversation with us. He uses the politicians' 
language. Despite all these differences, we are still concerned 
about our relationship with brother Abu-'Ammar, which is based 
on frankness and sincerity. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] How do you view your other half; namely, 
Jordan -- people and government? 
  ['Abbas] Regardless of the details, we believe that Jordan 
and Palestine are an integral whole, and that relations between 
the Palestinian and Jordanian peoples go far beyond relations 
between any two peoples in the region. Our relations are very 
interrelated and affect each other greatly.

  [Text] Damascus, 7 Mar (SANA)--The Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has announced that Iyad Salah, a 
young man from the front's Red Star Battalions, was martyred 
after he stabbed two settlers in the Gush Qatif settlement in 
the occupied Gaza Strip.

struggler Salah was martyred after a settler managed to open 
fire on the group that attacked the two Israeli settlers. Other 
members of the group successfully withdrew. 
  The statement added that the occupation forces were deployed 
in the area and that they set up roadblocks and began campaigns 
in search of the other group members.

<F P=106> [Interview with George Habash, secretary general of the </F>
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, by unidentified 
reporter -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIDA' AL-WATAN] How do you assess what took place 
at the Ibrahimi Mosque [in Hebron] and the reactions to the 
massacre. What do you expect in this regard? 
  [Habash] What happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque is an odious 
and bloody massacre that severely shocked the national, Arab, 
and international levels. It is a massacre that shocked the 
human conscience everywhere. 
  Whoever knows the history, nature, and mentality of the 
Zionist entity and the Zionist movement was not been surprised 
by this massacre. The Zionist history is rife with massacres. 
This bloody massacre has shattered any illusions about the 
nature of this fascist, racist, bloody entity. Most explicitly, 
I hold the Zionist entity's government and Rabin personally 
responsible for what was committed against our innocent and 
defenseless people at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the subsequent 
premeditated killing of the sons of our people who rose to 
express their indignation throughout the occupied homeland. As 
Rabin talks about peace, his troops and settlers continue their 
cold-blooded killing of innocent worshipers and our defenseless 
masses. It is ironic to claim that the perpetrator of the 
massacre was an insane settler. In fact, the massacre is the 
logical outcome of the policy of settlement and arming the herds 
of settlers from head to toe. It is the logical outcome of 
having an army addicted to killing and slaughtering. 
  The United States also bears direct responsibility for this 
and other massacres, for it continues to protect the Zionist 
entity, cover its crimes, and does its utmost to spare the 
Zionist entity any harm, and even condemnation. This is most 
visible through its stands at the UN Security Council, where the 
U.S. Administration is desperately fighting to circumvent the 
horrible massacre and its indications and dimensions. The 
settlements spread over our territory are an absolute violation 
of all UN resolutions. Why are these resolutions not 
implemented immediately? Why doesn't the U.S. Administration 
show the same enthusiasm to enforce the will of the 
international community, that it shows when imposing its will 
and racism against the peoples of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and 
other countries? There is no explanation for that except 
acceptance of what the Zionists are committing against our 
people to break their will and resistance and to peddle 
destructive schemes. 
  In the same vein, I do not absolve the spineless Palestinian 
leadership from responsibility for the tragedies and massacres 
of our people. That leadership has abandoned all national 
rights and recognized the Zionist entity's right to exist on our 
soil and agreed in the Oslo-Cairo accords to keep the 
settlements and settlers implanted among the sons of our people. 
However, this leadership knows well these settlements' nature 
and expansionist and bloody objectives. He who allows the 
occupation and its troops and settlers to stay on our national 
soil bears direct responsibility for the occupation authorities' 
acts of killing, repression, and terrorism against our resisting 
people. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has strongly and glaringly 
exposed the falsehood of all Zionist-U.S.-'Arafatist demagoguery 
about the alleged peace. What is being offered is capitulation 
that maintains occupation and settlements and approves of the 
acts of repression and killing against our people. 
  The crime is terrible and appalling. Therefore, we should be 
extremely vigilant to deny the U.S. and Zionist attempts to 
circumvent and contain this massacre through cosmetic measures 
any chances of success. 'Arafat and the Oslo team are striking 
a deceptive tone to absorb and contain the overwhelming and 
decisive popular reactions. The masses are well aware of the 
illusions and deceptive campaign that the spineless leadership 
has promoted after the signing of the Oslo and Cairo agreement. 
The masses are also aware of this leadership's deceptive talk 
about peace, security, prosperity, and sovereignty. 
  Therefore, in view of this massacre, we explicitly state 
that 
our masses can be protected and their security maintained only 
through the departure of the occupation troops, the complete 
removal of settlements from our land, and recognition of our 
people's right to repatriation and statehood, including 
Jerusalem. This means that the humiliating agreements, which 
fundamentally contravene our national principles and rights, 
should be overturned. 
  We are demanding an urgent popular and political movement 
pressing for the following: 
  --Overturning the humiliating agreements which contravene 
our 
national rights. 
  --Halting negotiations completely. 
  --Removing the settlements from our land completely. 
  --Providing international protection for our masses in the 
occupied homeland immediately in preparation for the Zionist 
army's full withdrawal. 
  --After the failure of the U.S. course which started in 
Madrid and the subsequent agreements, leading up to the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, we are demanding a return to the international 
option and the UN resolutions approving our people's national, 
inalienable rights: The rights to repatriation, 
self-determination, and statehood, including Jerusalem, the 
capital of Palestine. This should be an alternative to the U.S. 
course. 
  We hope that the massacre will constitute a turning point in 
the life of our Palestinian masses, the national, democratic, 
and Islamic political forces, and on the pan-Arab level to 
collectively confront the destructive Zionist-imperialist scheme 
and to maintain the option of struggle in order to attain our 
national and pan-Arab objectives.

<F P=106> [Press statement issued by the Russian press office in Tunis </F>
on 1 March] 
  [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin decided to send his 
personal envoy to carry out consultations with the leadership of 
the PLO within the existing framework of Russian-Palestinian 
cooperation to resolve issues involving a Middle East settlement. 
  President Yasir 'Arafat received a personal letter from 
President Boris Yeltsin in which he expressed Russia's strong 
intentions to help on all fronts to reach comprehensive peace 
and security in the Middle East. 
  Yasir 'Arafat expressed deep appreciation for the support 
that the Russian president was giving Palestinian people during 
these difficult times. He pointed out Russia's important role 
in the Middle East. 
  The meeting with the Palestinian leader focused on steps 
aimed at preserving the peace process in the light of the 
current tension in the occupied territories after the Hebron 
tragedy. 
  The Russian side expressed support for the Palestinian 
position on the necessity of securing an international presence 
in the occupied territories that would become an additional 
guarantee against the possible recurrence of such provocative 
acts. 
  President 'Arafat received with appreciation the Russian 
decision to provide practical aid to establish Palestinian 
self-rule. With the importance of Russian-Palestinian 
cooperation in the peace process in mind, an agreement was 
reached to continue close contacts.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in </F>
Cairo, by radio correspondents Sa'id Mu'addi and Sha'ul Menashe, 
in the studio--live] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Your Excellency Minister 'Amr Musa, good 
afternoon. 
  [Musa] You are welcome. 
  [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, intensive contacts 
and consultations are being held under Egyptian sponsorship, 
with the participation of the parties concerned, in order to 
resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Are there positive 
signs following the meeting between Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Musa] The objective is not only to resume negotiations. 
The objective is to tackle the problems that resulted from the 
crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque. This crime, committed 
by the murderer Barukh Goldstein, cannot go unnoticed. There 
must be measures to prevent similar crimes and ban the 
aggressions carried out by settlers, extremists, and terrorists 
against the Palestinians. This is an important and major issue. 
  It is inconceivable that matters should proceed normally in 
the wake of this crime without securing protection for the 
Palestinians and without ensuring Palestinian security. This is 
an important and basic issue. Negotiations can proceed normally 
when agreement is reached in this regard and when such measures 
are taken. 
  [Menashe] Your Excellency the Minister, apart from the 
existing problem between the PLO and Israel, is the atmosphere 
surrounding other Arab parties to the negotiations opportune to 
resume talks? 
  [Musa] The crime committed in Hebron by the terrorist 
settler and murderer Goldstein has enraged all Arabs and the 
whole world. Thus, the atmosphere is now replete with wrath 
regarding this crime while we await the measures that will be 
taken to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories 
from people similar to this terrorist murderer. 
  [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, the Israeli 
leadership, with all its party affiliations, denounced the 
criminal act that occurred in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Despite 
much sorrow and grief, the peace process should continue. 
Naturally, Egypt, which is a pioneer in this regard, will 
redouble its efforts to resume these negotiations. What role is 
Egypt currently playing to promote the peace process? 
  [Musa] The Israeli Government has indeed condemned this 
incident. What is important is not only to condemn or show 
resentment, but also to take measures that will prevent similar 
incidents. In other words, the settlers who carry arms should 
be prevented from entering the Arab territories. It is now very 
clear that the settlements are a serious issue and cannot go 
unnoticed, and that people should not be left free to kill the 
Palestinian Arabs in the manner of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
Measures should be taken. 
  Naturally, we in Egypt are convinced that peace can only be 
achieved through negotiations. The peace process began, and 
negotiations were about to achieve their objectives. We believe 
that negotiations are a positive process. However, measures 
should be taken on the ground to protect the Palestinian people. 
Do not forget that the Palestinians are living in territories 
that are occupied and that are not Israeli territories. 
Consequently, the settlers residing in the settlements should 
be encircled somehow in order to protect the Palestinians. This 
is because there is not just the issue of Israeli security but 
also the issue of Palestinian security on equal footing. This 
issue is now clear to the masses, to public opinion, and to all 
of us. It has also now clear that it is the Palestinian's 
security, and not only the Israeli's security, that is 
threatened. We want a just and balanced solution. We do not 
want any trivial thing meant only to say that we signed and 
negotiated. Hence, in order for negotiations to resume, which 
is important to us all, measures should be taken on the ground 
to protect the Palestinian people. 
  [Menashe] Mr. Minister, can we have a hint as to what took 
place yesterday in the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat, President 
Mubarak, and your excellency? Strictly speaking, are we 
proceeding toward the aspired objective despite the obstacles? 
  [Musa] I cannot give you a specific answer because the 
measures that are being taken in the occupied territories to 
protect the Palestinian people are a major issue. Everything 
depends on this issue. 
  [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, can we expect 
Foreign Minister Peres' arrival in Cairo to meet with Yasir 
'Arafat, or will contacts be held to hold a meeting between His 
Excellency President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin? 
  [Musa] Nothing has been decided yet on either meeting. 
  [Mu'addi] Your Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa, thank you very much. 
  [Musa] Thank you.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH demands that 
security be provided for the Palestinian people as a first step 
toward ending the occupation because this is the only way to 
bring about a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. 
  In an editorial today, the paper says that the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre revealed the serious dimensions of the Middle 
East conflict and proved that working for a just and 
comprehensive peace involving all parties concerned means 
providing security for all parties. It does not mean securing 
the existence of one party at the expense of the other. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH emphasizes that real peace requires ending all 
racist trends and discrediting all claims about the right to use 
force to expand into other people's lands and that peace means 
coexistence and cooperation without discrimination. Since the 
Palestinian people are disarmed under the occupation, the 
settlers living on lands they will never be entitled to under 
any circumstances must be disarmed, the paper stresses. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH affirms that Egypt will continue to back the 
Palestinian people with its firm, solid, and effective stances 
because this is the destiny it accepts willingly.

  [Text] Cairo, March 8 (AFP) -- A militant Islamic group, 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, late Monday claimed responsibility for 
renewed train attacks in southern Egypt and warned they would 
continue until the end of the week to avenge the Hebron massacre. 
  Gunmen, suspected by the interior ministry of being Islamic 
fundamentalists, meanwhile shot dead a plain-clothes policeman 
in Asyut province in southern Egypt just hours after a bomb 
exploded outside a hotel in the area, causing no casualties. 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, which seeks to replace the secular 
government of President Husni Mubarak with an Islamic state, 
urged the population to avoid "tourist sites, public 
transportation and everything connected with banks, which 
practice usury." 
  A communique delivered to international press agencies here 
said the group had carried out three attacks in southern Egypt 
early Monday that according to the latest interior ministry toll 
wounded 12 Egyptians. 
  It said the operation, the third it has claimed against 
trains travelling in southern Egypt in the past two weeks, had 
targeted "tourist trains" and had been conducted "to avenge the 
martyrs" of Hebron. 
  An estimated 30 Palestinians were gunned down last Friday by 
an Israeli settler as they prayed at a mosque in the West Bank 
town of Hebron. 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said the train attacks would 
"continue until the end of the month of Ramadan," the holy month 
of dawn-to-dusk fasting scheduled to end this weekend. 
  While the movement has directed previous operations against 
tourist facilities as part of its campaign to cripple the 
government, two of the trains attacked with automatic weapons 
early Monday carried only second and third class carriages and 
were being used by Egyptians of modest means. 
  Eleven people, six of them tourists, were hurt in a bomb 
attack on February 23 on a train between Cairo and Luxor. Four 
days earlier, two tourists and two Egyptians were wounded when 
gunmen fired on a train south of Asyut. Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah 
claimed responsibility for both operations. 
  The policeman attacked Monday died instantly after gunmen 
shot him in the village of Durunkah. The assailants made good 
their escape and the interior ministry was unable to indicate 
how many were involved.

  [Text] Cairo, 7 Mar (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR criticizes the UN 
Security Council, which still refuses to issue a clear, 
forthright resolution condemning the Israeli Government for the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in which hundreds were killed and 
wounded by an armed Jewish extremist. Later, more were killed 
and wounded by the Israeli Army during demonstrations to protest 
the massacre. 
  In an editorial today, the newspaper says that if some 
states 
defend the UN Security Council's slackness regarding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre using the 
excuse that certain powers obstruct any decisive resolution, the 
world cannot stand by when it sees this important authority 
become too weak to play the role entrusted to it by the UN 
Charter. 
  AL-AKHBAR calls for referring the matter to the UN General 
Assembly to take the necessary measures to restore the UN 
Security Council's esteem.

  [Text] Damascus, 7 Mar (MENA)--Muhammad Basyuni, Egypt's 
ambassador to Israel, has affirmed that Syria is the key to 
comprehensive peace, without it, there can be no comprehensive 
peace in the region. 
  This came in an interview with the Egyptian ambassador 
published in one of the Israeli Arab newspapers of which some 
issues were distributed in Damascus by the Arab Israeli 
delegation currently visiting Damascus. 
  Ambassador Basyuni clarified that despite the difficulty in 
the Syrian-Israeli peace track, it has clear characteristics. 
He noted that a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria 
cannot be reached without full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights. 
  He affirmed that Syria cannot accept anything less than full 
withdrawal in return for comprehensive peace. 
  He pointed out that peace is the essential demand of all 
people in the region without exception. He expects that 1994 
will be the year of peace in which agreements on the Declaration 
of Principles will be signed on all peace tracks. 
  As regards reports on terrorism in Egypt, the Egyptian 
ambassador affirmed in his interview that what is being reported 
about this topic is exaggerated. Violence and terrorism are an 
international phenomenon from which many progressive and 
developed countries are suffering. It is not restricted to 
Egypt alone.

  [Text] Cairo, 6 Mar (MENA)--Interim Somali President Ali 
Mahdi Mohamed has expressed his appreciation to President 
Mubarak for meeting with the leaders of the Somali groups today. 
In a statement to reporters today, he said that the leaders of 
the Somali groups thanked President Mubarak, the Egyptian 
Government, and the fraternal Egyptian people for their 
strenuous efforts toward finding a solution to the Somali 
problem. He voiced his hope that these efforts will succeed in 
finding a solution to the Somali problem. Mohamed said that the 
meetings of the 12 Somali groups in Cairo reached an agreement 
on a statement that includes a complete concept on which all the 
Somali groups agreed. 
  Responding to a question on General Mohamed Farah Aidid's 
view of this statement, Mohamed said that Aidid did not take 
part in the meetings and that a delegation will be sent to him 
with the statement to study it. 
  Replying to a question on reports that a provisional 
government will be formed at the end of March and whether the 
declaration will speed up its formation, Mohamed said: We hope 
that this will happen. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the 
meetings of the 12 Somali groups in Cairo and their invitations 
to the three other factions affirm that the situation in Somalia 
is entering a new stage that calls for reconciliation among the 
majority. He noted that Egypt sent an invitation to all the 
Somali factions, including General Aidid. He stressed that 
Egypt does not differentiate between Somali groups. He pointed 
out that it is important for Somalia to enter into a new stage 
of building on the basis of the agreement and the participation 
of all groups in the presidential council or consultative 
council. He noted that every leader has his standing according 
to the Addis Ababa resolutions on national reconciliation in 
Somalia. He said that President Husni Mubarak will send a 
message to Ethiopian leader Meles Zenawi in his capacity as the 
chairman entrusted with following up on the Somali problem. He 
said that the message will deal with the latest developments. 
Egypt will also brief other African countries on the Somali 
agreement. He expressed his hope that these developments will 
lead to genuine moves to resolve the Somali problem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian fundamentalist Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim </F>
by Hisham Mubarak in Copenhagen; date not given; first three 
paragraphs are POLITIKEN introduction] 
  [Text] As reported in POLITIKEN on Tuesday, the Egyptian 
Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, who has been granted political asylum in 
Denmark, has issued threats against foreign tourists and 
investments in Egypt. 
  The Egyptian lawyer and author Hisham Mubarak has been to 
Denmark to interview Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim. Hisham Mubarak is 
writing a book about the Islamic fundamentalists and their 
international network. 
  The following is an extract from the interview with Tal'at 
Fu'ad Qassim. 
  [Mubarak] What are the Islamic Groups now concentrating 
their efforts on? 
  [Qassim] We are taking a three-pronged approach. First, we 
are aiming at a military coup. On this front things are going 
very well. The state has absolutely no information about it, 
and the security police are being kept busy by a few small-scale 
actions which some of the Groups' younger members have carried 
out in the provinces. 
  Secondly, the population as a whole has to be mobilized. In 
order to be able to carry out an Islamic revolution, the whole 
population must be mobilized. It is very important to prevent 
foreign intervention or, failing that, to delay foreign 
intervention for at least 18 days, in the view of our military 
people. We have organized many demonstrations and one of the 
purposes of these was to train the Groups' members to mobilize 
people, and we are experts in this field. 
  Thirdly, special missions. These are of great significance, 
in that they involve the murder of some of the people in 
government posts. (...) This organizational unit (responsible 
for special missions -- POLITIKEN editorial note) has gained 
experience through carrying out a number of missions, it is now 
ready, and it will play a part in the implementation of the plan 
(to overthrow the regime -- POLITIKEN editorial note). This 
unit is active and it will not stop the death missions as long 
as circumstances make these activities necessary. It is a 
misunderstanding to think that the arrests of some members of 
the Groups or an absence of action over a period of time are a 
sign of weakness, since this is in accordance with a plan 
adopted for this organizational unit's activity. 
<H5>  Preparations for a Military Coup </H5>
  The state knows nothing about the military organizational 
unit which is responsible for preparing a military coup, nor 
does it know anything about the organizational unit responsible 
for special missions. If some of its members are arrested, the 
only information these members have is about their own cell, and 
that is no help to the security police at all. As for the other 
cells, there is no connection between them at all. 
  [Mubarak] The former members of the military or those who 
stood accused in the Jihad case (court case in connection with 
the murder of al-Sadat -- POLITIKEN editorial note) were rank 
and file soldiers and officers who had no power. If we assume 
that what you say is correct, this does not pose a great threat. 
What are your views? 
  [Qassim] I disagree with you. It is the young officers who 
hold the real power, since soldiers do not take their orders 
from the generals, and we believe in the importance of 
lower-ranking officers; history has shown this. They are the 
most motivated people. 
<H5>  Tourists Spread AIDS </H5>
  [Mubarak] Why have the Islamic Groups carried out terrorist 
acts against tourism? 
  [Qassim] There is more than one reason for the policy of 
attacking tourism. Firstly, tourism is a major source of income 
which is incompatible with Islam and which goes to fill the 
state coffers. This means that the regime receives money which 
helps to keep it in power, while we think that the regime should 
be removed. So we have decided to strike this area in order to 
remove this source of income to the government, so that the 
regime loses its power. (...) 
  Secondly, tourism in its present form is an abominable thing 
because it spreads prostitution and AIDS via female Jewish 
tourists. It is a vile means of spreading all forms of 
immorality. Tourism is also used to collect information on the 
Islamic Groups for foreign intelligence services. Therefore 
tourism, in our eyes, is an abominable thing which should be 
changed. These are the reasons for the tourist sector being hit 
in accordance with the Groups' strategy of damaging the regime. 
  [Mubarak] But the acts of violence which you have 
committed were also intended to kill, since it was tourists who 
were killed. What connection is there between the tourists and 
the government? 
  [Qassim] Some of the tourists are insured against being 
killed. That is why our slogan is tourism, not tourists. We 
have done a lot of planning and preparation because we wish to 
avoid killing tourists. So we took a number of measures. We 
issued various declarations, warning tourists against coming to 
Egypt where their lives would be in danger. We declared that 
anyone coming to Egypt was risking their life, because the 
tourist sector is targeted, and we sent declarations to all the 
competent authorities, in which they were urged not to admit 
tourists for the reasons mentioned. In the light of this, those 
who come anyway deserve whatever happens to them. 
<H5>  Attack on Investments </H5>
  [Mubarak] You have issued a statement in which it appears 
that investments are shortly to become a target for the Groups' 
mission. When will you carry out violent acts against 
investments? 
  [Qassim] The time when investments will be attacked depends 
on a number of factors. One of these is the Egyptian security 
police's treatment of us. We will assess how the struggle 
between the state and ourselves is progressing. If the state 
shows increasing violence towards us, we will attack investments 
in revenge and in order to prevent such violence. 
  [Mubarak] Can you not here give what you see as valid 
reasons, as you can in the case of the tourist sector. What 
reasons are there for attacking investments? 
  [Qassim] Our aim is to destroy all state institutions with 
the least possible bloodshed. These things are very simple. 
One of our military cells in the Groups has the capacity to 
attack investments in Egypt, when the time is ripe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General 'Abd-al-Rahman Sa'id, </F>
"no. two in the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army 
organization," by Nizar Daw-al-Na'im in London; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Daw-al-Na'im] What means do you have at your 
disposal to topple the regime? And do you prefer one means to 
another? 
  [Sa'id] As military men and a military organization we plan 
our work, and we intend to win the battle for which we have 
planned by every means. We are trying to apply all available 
means to achieve victory. We are bound by what was mentioned in 
our first statement on ways of toppling the regime and by what 
was mentioned in the Democratic National Grouping's charter in 
this connection. The charter stressed the need to topple the 
regime by all available means, including civilian and military 
means. Our job, as the grouping's military arm, is the latter. 
In Sudan's history civilian means were used twice: once to 
topple the regime of Lt. Gen. Ibrahim 'Abbud (1964) and (former 
President Ja'far) Numayri (1985). The Army intervened after the 
masses' participation. That scenario will continue. 
  The statement we addressed to the Sudanese forces inside the 
country as the Legitimate Command of the Sudanese Army said that 
we should work together to topple the regime. It means that, 
since we addressed individuals carrying arms, these arms should 
be used to topple the regime. Of course, it would be better if 
the aim can be achieved through peaceful means. However, 
individuals who are carrying arms can use these arms. 
  We do not expect our battle with the regime to be easy. And 
we will use all our strength from both inside and outside the 
Army, and we will use the people's factions in the capital and 
the other cities to settle the final battle. We have our own 
military plans, but I cannot talk about them. However, I can 
say that we are about to topple the regime by all the means 
available to us. 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] Are you coordinating in this connection with 
the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM]? 
  [Sa'id] We discussed this coordination in the first meeting 
with the movement's leader, Colonel John Garang, and his aides, 
which was held in November 1990. There was a point which we had 
to clarify, namely that we are the legitimate commanders of the 
Armed Forces. And as you know, the movement is in a state of 
war with the Armed Forces, whose commanders are supposed to be 
us. Here comes the contradiction, because we do not want the 
Armed Forces to be defeated by the movement while we are seeking 
to topple the regime in Khartoum. This position was clear, and 
the movement's leaders appreciated it. This leads us to stress 
that we are not betraying the Armed Forces, revealing their 
plans, or talking to the brothers in the SPLM about the points 
of weakness or strength in the Army. We only discuss with them 
coordination for the sake of toppling the regime, each side 
using its own method. And we cannot stop them from continuing 
the ongoing war, nor can they drag us into their war against the 
regime. [passage omitted] 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] It is often said that any military attempt to 
restore democracy in Sudan could turn into a civil war. Is that 
what you want? And what guarantees are there to prevent that 
happening? 
  [Sa'id] There is no possibility of civil war breaking out in 
the event of a confrontation with the regime's forces. Against 
whom is that civil war supposed to be fought. The regime arms 
the militias to help it survive. It is the regime which is 
calling for a war of that kind. But we are aware of that and do 
not believe that a civil war is going to break out if we 
confront the regime, even if this confrontation is military. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] In your first statement you urged Sudanese 
Army personnel to rebel against the regime, but that did not 
happen.... 
  [Sa'id] We urged officers and soldiers to support 
legitimacy, not to rebel. Because they did rebel when they 
joined President 'Umar al-Bashir, or when he deceived them. We 
urged them to return to legitimacy, not to rebel again. As for 
the scale of their response to our appeal, it cannot be 
measured. However, we can talk about the reaction to this 
appeal. This reaction was reflected in the strict surveillance 
measures applied by the regime against officers and soldiers. 
For example, it prevented them from leaving their units, 
tightened security control over them, even inside their barracks 
and homes, and prevented nonserving officers entering the 
barracks to finalize some matters, as used to happen before. 
And large-scale changes were made in the military leaderships 
in the capital, with these being replaced by cadres from the 
National Islamic Front. And officers whose loyalty was deemed 
suspect were moved to the war zone in the south, and a large 
number were dismissed. All this clarifies the scale of the 
response, which did not crystallize clearly because the regime, 
with all the capabilities at its disposal, managed to confront 
this move. This is why I believe that the appeal we addressed 
encountered a great response and can be exploited at any time. 
The fact that we have not seen anything tangible does not 
necessarily mean there is no response. 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] The information available to the media says 
that no serving officers have joined you, and that all members 
of the organization are nonserving officers. 
  [Sa'id] A small number of serving officers have joined us. 
And I cannot say that there is a large number of them. The 
reason for that is the extensive measures taken by the 
government. 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] A special court is currently looking into the 
case of the bombings which the government says were part of a 
plan to undermine stability and overthrow the regime. What is 
your link with that operation? 
  [Sa'id] We did not have any involvement in the so-called 
bombing case. I do not deny that we know some of the defendants 
in the case. And of course, the regime was bound to associate 
our relationship with these defendants and the case in order to 
prove our involvement. By virtue of my 25-year experience in 
the Engineer Corps I cannot plan a naive operation like that, 
because it is difficult to obtain explosives from outside the 
country and there is a lack of them inside. [passage omitted] 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] Have you carried out any military actions 
against the regime over the past four years? 
  [Sa'id] We have not carried out any action that satisfies 
our aspiration. We have planned actions, but they have not been 
carried out for one reason or another. We know that four years 
is a long time and causes boredom for those who would 
participate in actions of that kind. But the circumstances are 
not helpful. We are discussing the possibility of taking action 
with our own capabilities. International conditions and the 
opposition's circumstances are responsible for this situation. 
We have not had a base from which to act, or sufficient aid. 
And I believe that all these obstacles will soon disappear. 
And I am optimistic that the regime will be toppled by an armed 
action, and that all aid will arrive soon. 
  [Daw-al-Na'im] A disagreement erupted inside your 
organization recently. What is the nature of the differences, 
and what is the scale of the split? 
  [Sa'id] The nature of military political action requires a 
degree of flexibility -- which sometimes leads to the 
intervention of some parties, hence the disagreements. Like 
other political forces, we have not been spared that disease. 
However, thank God, our brothers in the military establishment 
who differed with us joined the Legitimate Command willingly, 
and they have offered a great deal. So the discipline exists, 
regardless of our differences. Military discipline exists and 
we respect one another. The disagreement needed to be tacked 
and, thank God, has been contained. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kampala, 5 Mar (PANA) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister 
Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih, said in Kampala on Saturday [5 March] 
that bombing raids being carried out by the Sudanese Airforce on 
position held by the rebel Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army 
(SPLA), is aimed at forcing them to the negotiating table. 
"Much as the Sudan favours a cease-fire and a complete 
cessation of hostilities, previous experiences have shown that 
treating the issue of the cease-fire separately is a futile 
exercise", the foreign minister told a press conference in 
Kampala. 
  Abu-Salih who arrived in Uganda from Kenya on Friday, with a 
message from President 'Umar al-Bashir to Preesident Yoweri 
Museveni said, Khartoum believes that fighting is not a solution 
to war. "We want a just and genuine peace in the Sudan", he 
said. He claimed that much of the fighting in the southern 
Sudan is betwen the rebel factions themselves and tribes hostile 
to the rebels. 
  The foreign minister who returns back to Kenya Saturday said 
Sudan fully supports peace initiatives by the four heads of 
state in the Inter-Governmental Authority on Desertification and 
Development (IGADD), the objectives of which is to reach a 
negotiated peaceful settlement of the civil war in the southern 
Sudan. 
  "These countries sharing the same borders with the Sudan, 
being fully knowladgable of the root causes of the problem, are 
better placed to help bring about the desired peaceful 
settlement", he said. He added however, that proper 
negotiations should be consucted by his government and the 
rebels to reach a peaceful settlement. 
  The Khartoum [as received] in 1992 launched the latest 
massive military operation against the southern rebels led by 
the SPLA which accused the central governmment of trying to 
Islamise the entire country.

  [Text] The prime minister today declared that the 
government is determined to put down Pakistan-sponsored 
terrorism in Kashmir and nothing will come in the way of 
protecting India's territorial integrity. Describing Islamabad 
raising the human rights issue in Kashmir at Geneva as totally 
uncalled for, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that Pakistan has no locus 
standi other than that of an aggressor. 
  The prime minister said the government will carry out the 
mandate of Parliament expressed in its unanimous resolution in 
letter and spirit. He was replying in the Lok Sabha today to 
the marathon debate on the motion of thanks to the president's 
address. The house later adopted the motion by a voice vote 
after rejecting all opposition amendments. Mr. Rao regretted 
that the basic question on Kashmir has taken a back seat and 
peripheral issues like human rights have come to the fore. He 
said the Parliament resolution reflects the determination of the 
nation to protect the territorial integrity of the country, but 
the house should go into further details so that the world must 
know what our Parliament thinks about the issue. 
  Amid thumping of desks by the treasury benches, Mr. Rao said 
that the export of terrorism by Pakistan into the Kashmir valley 
should stop and the government is determined to do it. He said 
the development efforts in the valley will be intensified and 
details will be given to the house later. The prime minister 
dealt with wide-ranging issues including Ayodhya, Dunkel draft, 
economy, rural development, and reorganization of states. 
  On Ayodhya, he appealed to the members not to be agitated 
any 
more as the Supreme Court is seized of the matter. He said once 
the apex court gives its opinion, action will be initiated 
taking the house into confidence. 
  On reorganization of states, the prime minister said he is 
not in favor of opening the Pandora box. However, specific 
schemes have to be initiated to remove imbalance in development. 
Referring to the situation in the northeast, he said the 
overall situation has improved and special attention is being 
paid for the development of the region. He pointed out that for 
the first time in 40 years, Mizoram has representation in the 
council of ministers. 
  Turning to the Dunkel draft, the prime minister declared 
that 
the farmers' interest will not be compromised and on the other 
hand the agriculture exports will get a boost.

  [Text] Colombo, 3 Mar (LANKAPUVATH) -- Sri Lanka's security 
forces have in a new wave of motivation and confidence killed 
over one hundred LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] 
terrorists while losing only six soldiers in the first two 
months of 1994, in ten incidents where the LTTE attacked in 
large strength but were beaten back with heavy losses. 
  They have not only repulsed attacks by the LTTE though 
heavily outnumbered, but also killed as many as an estimated 100 
terrorists mostly in close quarter battle, military spokesman 
Brigadier Gemunu Kulatunga told LANKAPUVATH Thursday. 
  Giving details, he said that a group of soldiers training 
with dummy ammunition and firing mortars at Weli Oya were fired 
on by LTTE terrorists with a barrage of live mortars on Tuesday. 
The mortar trainees had immediately reloaded their mortars with 
live ammunition and hit back hard at the terrorists killing two 
of them and forcing others to withdraw. Two soldiers were also 
killed in this incident which occurred during daylight hours. 
  Brigadier Kulatunga said that 15 terrorists were confirmed 
killed and 10 bodies recovered at Comar Point, Pooneryn, in 
northern Sri Lanka. 
  He said that in an another incident, 30 to 40 LTTE 
terrorists 
had been killed in a dawn attack on an army picket moving from 
Kahambiligasyayad detachment at Weli Oya. In this incident four 
soldiers had been killed when a terrorist mortar hit a buffel 
[as received] vehicle which they were manning causing an 
explosion of the ammunition inside it. In an act of rare 
bravery and courage a single soldier charged at the LTTE 
terrorists with his T-56 firing burst after burst at a group of 
thoroughly shocked terrorists killing five of them while the 
others ran. Subsequently reinforcements and air cover were 
called in and about 30-40 terrorists were killed. 
  A report from Thoppigala in the jungles south of Batticaloa 
District states that troops effectively beat back a pre-election 
attack by about 200 terrorists with two terrorists being 
confirmed killed. 
  The military spokesman said that at Angodawillu eight 
terrorists were confirmed killed when a group of 75 cadres 
attacked a security forces patrol. 
  At Etawetunawewa in Weli Oya, a group of 25 soldiers, many 
of 
them bathing naked in the tank, after a hard day's training were 
repulsed an attack at dusk by two groups of terrorists numbering 
about 50 in each group. The soldiers had swum ashore, picked up 
their rifles and blasted the terrorists killing at least 20 of 
them. The terrorists had on radio transmissions monitored by 
technical sources admitted being stunned at the fierce counter 
attack launched by the soldiers and made frantic calls for 
vehicles to evacuate the wounded terrorists. Only four soldiers 
were wounded in this incident.

  [Text] The prime minister has said that a solution to the 
Kashmir issue, support to the cause of Muslims throughout the 
world, increase in energy production, and a check on the 
population boom are the foremost priorities of her government. 
Addressing a Ramadhan fast-breaking dinner for journalists, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto said that the support to the cause of Kashmiris 
is included in the 1947 principles of our independence, and we 
are continuing the support to Muslims of Bosnia, Afghanistan, 
and Palestine under the same spirit. 
  The prime minister said that for us, the Kashmir cause is a 
part of our faith in God, and we have made intensive efforts and 
taken practical steps in this regard; and instead of remaining 
silent as in the past decade, we have fully highlighted the 
Kashmir issue. The prime minister said that one of our goals is 
to do away with Pakistan's international isolation. She said 
that Pakistan was on the verge of being declared a terrorist 
state during the past regime. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that her government has decided to 
present the Jammu and Kashmir issue in its correct perspective. 
Pakistan values freedom, for which the Muslims of the 
subcontinent launched a struggle under our great leader Jinnah. 
She said that her government's political will and determination 
have helped in taking the Kashmir issue from one capital to the 
other and from one city to the other, thereby apprising the 
world leaders of the miserable condition in Kashmir. She said 
that the opposition should have cooperated with us in this 
regard, but it disappointed us. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that she visited Cyprus within a few 
hours after assuming the office to apprise the Commonwealth 
leaders of Indian atrocities in Kashmir. Eventually, the 
government decided to present the issue before the the UN Human 
Rights Commission in Geneva. This is the first time since the 
1950's that this has happened. 
  Referring to internal issues, the prime minister said that 
she has directed the authorities to ensure fiscal discipline to 
contain the budgetary deficit that presently stands at about 60 
billion rupees. The federal and provincial governments will 
have to cut their nondevelopmental expenditures at all levels.

<F P=106> [Report by Raja Zulfikar] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad: Foreign Minister Sardar Asif has said 
that Pakistan's vital interest is not Khalistan, nor break-up of 
India "if India breaks up, it will affect us also". 
  While talking to a group of journalists in the Senate hall 
where he had come to cast his vote in the Senate election, the 
foreign minister said: "We do not wish to see break-up of 
India. Pakistan's vital interest is Kashmir and not Khalistan or 
other things like Nagaland and this or that." 
  He deplored that the leader of the opposition thought that 
establishment of Khalistan was in the national interest of 
Pakistan, and not Kashmir. He differed with the idea that a 
strong India was a threat to Pakistan. 
  "Big and small countries do not have a set of relations. If 
the big country begins to live as equal neighbour, it is no 
problem. After all, the USA and Mexico are also living in peace 
like China and Bhutan. Why can't India live in peace with 
neighbours." He said the day they (India) changed the mentality 
of bulldozing the region, the matter will be over. 
  Replying to a question about increase in Indian defence 
expenditure, Sardar Asif said Pakistan could not protest against 
this because it was India's sovereign right to spend whatever it 
liked. However, he said it was very unfortunate and this would 
escalate arms race in the region and would definitely increase 
tension. He said Pakistan was reducing its defence expenditure 
but India was increasing it. 
  "From whom do they fear a threat? There is no country that 
can threaten them in this region. We all feel extremely 
concerned and this is not the concern of Pakistan alone but of 
South Asian countries and all those countries which are in the 
Indian Ocean region." 
  The Foreign Affairs Minister linked the passage of 
Pak-sponsored resolution on Kashmir with the international 
morality and a test of the world moral position. 
  Though not pessimistic yet a rather concerned Sardar Asif 
remarked "a broad trend of events shows that economic interests 
have superseded morality. There is little morality and much 
commercialism everywhere," the minister said during a chat with 
a group of newsmen in the Senate Hall which was declared a 
polling station on Wednesday. 
  He expressed Pakistan's concern over increase in the Indian 
defence expenditure and termed it unfortunate. He further said 
that Pakistan's vital interest was in Kashmir and not in 
Khalistan or breakup of India. 
  Asked if the Pak-sponsored resolution on Kashmir met 
failure, 
would it not demoralise the people? Sardar Asif remarked it 
should not. "We want to find out exactly what are the double 
standards. We want to know how much morality is left in the 
West. We will test them again and again, we want to test them 
now and later in September and we will test them at every 
forum," the minister maintained. 
  He described the Kashmir resolution as an election "and when 
you are into an election, you go with open eyes, knowing fully 
that you can win or lose." According to the Foreign Minister, 
the fate of the resolution did not depend on arithmetics or 
number count, instead it was a question of world conscience. 
  He was satisfied that Pakistan had done every thing 
possible. 
"There is nothing which we could have done that we have not 
done." he did not agree that it would be a diplomatic failure if 
the resolution did not get through. "How can," he said, 
"Pakistan be held responsible if there is no international 
morality left? You cannot blame the victim." But he did say 
that every one agreed the human rights violations must stop in 
the Indian-held Kashmir. 
  Sardar Asif, however, said the world at large had special 
relations with India as it was a market of a billion people. 
The western countries have commercial links with India and mega 
deals with them which they don't want to lose," the minister 
said. [quotation marks as published] 
  Replying to a question about Afghanistan, Sardar Asif 
elaborated that there was a possibility of reopening of 
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul as soon as possible but he made it 
conditional with adequate compensation and return of equipment. 
However, he said relations with Afghanistan were all right. 
  To another question, he said Islamabad had not closed the 
border with Afghanistan but re-established it. "We have to give 
a clear signal to every one that it is international border and 
there must be respect for it." He warned that no illegal entry 
would be allowed. Islamabad, he said, would try to relax 
conditions as much as the situation demanded. He said General 
Ziaul Haq, whom he termed a dictator, had introduced several 
flaws in connection with passport and visa facilities to the 
Afghan nationals and their Pakistani citizenship. 
  About any fresh India-Pak contact, Sardar Asif said Pakistan 
wanted to go forward with the talks and it was keen for a 
dialogue "but let them create conditions for talks to proceed." 
  He described as baseless an allegation by Indian Foreign 
Secretary that Pakistan was creating hurdles in development of 
good relations and said Islamabad was prepared to discuss any 
thing. But he said it was unfortunate that the call for 
improving human rights situation was dubbed as `hurdle'.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Increase in the Defense Budget"] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan has informed the International Monetary 
Fund of its decision to increase its defense budget by 100 
billion rupees for the next fiscal year following India's 
announcement of a 20-percent hike in its defense budget. 
Pakistan has also made it clear to the monetary organization 
that the new dimensions of dangers posed to this region due to 
the increase in the Indian defense budget cannot be ignored. 
Financial organizations like the IMF have adopted a policy of 
imposing tough conditions when providing aid and loans to needy, 
developing countries. Generally, conditions like a cut in 
defense expenditure and the number of armed forces personnel are 
set in cases of Islamic countries. Pressure has also been 
exerted on Pakistan to accept this condition. However, India 
has been exempted from it. The Pakistan Government has been 
severely criticized by the opposition and some other political 
circles, and it is not possible for the government to easily 
reject these criticisms. 
  By deciding to increase the defense budget, the government 
has silenced its political opponents, and the people have 
expressed their satisfaction. By informing responsible persons 
in the IMF about the decision, the Government of Pakistan has 
also made it clear that it is not willing to put its security 
and existence at stake merely to secure loans from a financial 
organization. The fact is that India's aggressive designs in 
this region is no secret and Pakistan faces the gravest danger 
from the Indian buildup. This is because it is with Pakistan 
that India has the most serious dispute, in the form of Kashmir. 
India considers Pakistan as the biggest hurdle in this region to 
the fulfillment of its designs. Pakistan has already been the 
target of Indian aggression thrice. Therefore, it cannot afford 
to ignore Indian activities. 
  Under the circumstances, the Government of Pakistan's 
decision is an appropriate and sensible one in the interest of 
the country's security and a strong national defense. The 
government should scrupulously adhere to the decision. 
Pakistan's position is very strong and forceful and this is why 
it is not possible for any country or organization to ever 
counter Pakistan's arguments at any forum.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Threat of Trade Sanctions"] </F>
  [Text] The US is reportedly threatening Pakistan with 
trade sanctions. During the tenure of the Nawaz Sharif 
government, two cases were filed under the US Trade Act of 1974 
which seek the withdrawal of the `most favoured nation' status 
thus far accorded to Pakistan. The grounds for this are that 
Pakistan has not been abiding by ILO [International Labour 
Organization] conventions on labour rights. Bonded and child 
labour are said to be widely used in some industries here. 
According to reports in the litigation underway, the present 
government has deliberately failed to meet the deadlines set by 
the American judicial committee and this could result in the 
threat of the sanctions being turned into a reality. Whether 
this allegation is accurate is uncertain, but in any case since 
both the Labour and Commerce Ministries as well as the Law 
Division are involved, it is not clear who is in fact 
responsible for framing the answers required by the litigation 
in the US. Matters have come to such a pass despite the fact 
that the PM [Prime Minister] had constituted a committee headed 
by Shahnaz Wazir Ali to coordinate the concerned Ministries' and 
Departments' efforts. It now appears that this Committee was 
for some reason unable to meet the deadlines. Perhaps the lapse 
was not intentional but related to the complexity of the matter 
and the various government departments' inefficiency. An entire 
gamut of our exports such as carpets and textile goods are 
likely to be the victim of these sanctions, if imposed. 
  A large part of our population lives way below the poverty 
line. To simply state that child and bonded labour should be 
eliminated to meet American legal requirements for preferential 
treatment in trade is unrealistic and ignores the harsh problems 
our poor face to merely survive. Obviously, earnings from these 
forms of labour cannot be replaced by any measure overnight, 
even though our government ought really to be paying more regard 
to safety nets for our less privileged. As a prerequisite to 
doing away with these ills, jobs will have to be created on a 
vast scale and adequate remuneration for the bread earners of 
families provided so that the poor are not compelled to send 
their children to work or engage in bonded labour. Meanwhile, 
the government should gear up its efforts to try and convince 
the US authorities that we are heading in the desirable 
direction and in turn, stave off the crippling effect, estimated 
at a loss of $200 to $400 million in 1994 alone, that trade 
sanctions would have on the economy.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A Jordanian official 
source has announced that the results of the interrogation of 
the detainees held in connection with the case of the explosions 
and assassinations plot in Jordan necessitated more arrests of 
suspects linked to the 23 detainees known as "Afghan Arabs" and 
confiscation of arms kept in their hideouts. 
  The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the prosecutor of the 
Jordanian State Security Court, which handles cases affecting 
state security, expected the number of the detainees to 
increase, and that a number of Kalashnikov machine guns, 
explosives, and pistols were found in the posession of the 
accused and in some hideouts in Amman. 
  Disclosing some details about the detainees, the source said 
that they had all gone to Afghanistan via a third state, that 
some of them received training there for three months on various 
types of weapons, and that the detainees did not know one 
another but they did know their leader and commander who is also 
now under detention with them. 
  The source added that they operated in small cells with one 
secret official in charge and that they did not give their 
organization any name because they did not want such a name to 
circulate and eventually lead to their exposure. 
  He said that they had confessed that they all belonged to 
one 
group which had one leader who is now detained with them, and 
that they used to arrange their travel to Afghanistan through 
individuals returning from Afghanistan who would supply them 
with air tickets and addresses to go to in other states, and 
that they would stay at some relief home [Bayt i'ashah] until 
someone came to provide them with the necessary information and 
requirements after which they would go to Afghanistan. 
  They emphasized in their confessions that had worked for the 
elimination of vice which, to them, meant movie theaters, video 
cassettes, bars, and shops which sell alcoholic drinks. They 
also confessed that they had planned to assassinate Jordanian 
and Palestinian prominent civilian and military figures, and 
that their actions were also aimed against the current peace 
process and geared toward preventing the conclusion of peace 
agreements with Israel. The Jordanian source expected the 
investigation to be completed and the entire case to be referred 
to the Jordanian State Security Court around the middle of this 
current month. 
  The recent explosion in the Salwa movie theater in the town 
of al-Zarqa', in which Egyptian citizen 'Id al-Jahhalin (the man 
who planted the bomb) was injured and had his two legs and one 
finger in his left hand amputated, enabled the Jordanian 
authorities to lay their hands on the first strings of the case. 
  Al-Jahhalin confessed that his task was only to plant the 
detonator in the timer of the explosive device which included 
four coconut-shaped bombs. 
  Al-Jahhalin, who is now at al-Zarqa' government hospital, 
said that he regretted what he did.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Washington Is Behind the Obstruction of </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Administration, which is called the 
sponsor of the peace process, should have responsibly taken the 
initiative to have the Security Council issue a strong 
resolution to curb Zionist persistence in launching mass 
killings, committing hideous crimes, carrying out bloody 
massacres against Arab citizens, and violating their places of 
worship in the occupied territories. Instead, the U.S. 
Administration has done its best to prevent the issuance of any 
deterrent international resolution which would end the crimes 
committed by Jews. 
  While several Security Council members, including Britain, 
France, and Russia, believe in the need to pass a resolution 
that provides protection for the Palestinian people under 
Israeli occupation, for dispatching an international protection 
force to the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and for 
disarming the Jewish settlers, the U.S. Administration is trying 
to foil this approach and prevent the issuance of any resolution 
in this regard. 
  Moreover, the U.S. Administration is working to contain the 
strained Arab-Israeli negotiations and deflate angry 
Palestinian, Arab, and international reactions by inviting a 
Palestinian delegation to Washington and trying to convince it 
of the need to unconditionally resume negotiations with Israel 
and to stop demanding the issuance of an international 
resolution against Israel. 
  Negotiations between the U.S. Administration and the 
Palestinian side are still continuing without results. What 
draws attention is the fact that this U.S. role, which 
encourages Israel and its terrorist policy, has also encouraged 
Israeli authorities to continue their hideous crimes against 
Arab citizens. Several martyrs and a many wounded fall every 
day. Israeli authorities deliberately prevent Muslims from 
performing prayers at the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque and other 
places of worship, which paralyzes and obstructs the peace 
process. 
  If the U.S. Administration insists on encouraging Israel to 
adhere to the arming of settlers and rejecting the dispatch of 
an international protection force to the occupied Palestinian 
territories, then it will have contributed to the obstruction of 
the peace process. 
  It makes no sense to resume the Palestinian-Israeli and 
Arab-Israeli negotiations while the campaign of mass killings is 
escalating against the Palestinian people. It can be said that 
if the U.S. Administration actually wants to resume the peace 
process and achieve peace, it should stop encouraging Israel and 
end its full bias toward Israel. This administration should 
also participate in passing an international resolution to 
ensure protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Annihilation Way Toward Peace!"] </F>
  [Text] Most of us cannot understand how the Ramadan 
massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque could open the road to peace, 
nor can we understand how each massacre will remove an obstacle 
facing a settlement we all have been talking about and believe 
is achieving big victories that are late but almost close at 
hand. 
  We realize the annihilation of the Palestinian people will 
enable the Israeli entity to achieve the peace it wants. We 
realize that the annihilation of Muslims in Yugoslavia makes 
peace the right of those the Westerners call Bosnian Serbs. We 
also realize that the continuation of the racist embargo of the 
Iraqi people will lead to the death of all the Iraqis. Through 
this, international legitimacy -- the respect for which the 
United States is seeking to impose on the enemies of Washington 
to the exclusion of all others -- would be achieved. 
  The Americans are the only ones who can make peace in the 
Middle East. By virtue of the fact that the Americans have a 
strategic alliance with the Israelis, the anticipated peace will 
be one that achieves the interests of both allies. Moreover, 
when Goldstein, the hero of the Ramadan massacre, sees that the 
world is applauding the killers in Somalia, Yugoslavia, and 
Iraq, then it is natural for him to consider those killers -- 
who are slaughtering people in the name of protecting them and 
are launching wars of annihilation under the pretext of 
defending international legitimacy -- as his model. It is no 
coincidence that Goldstein should have been born and raised in 
America and have a Zionist behavior and mentality. Such a 
combination is what produced the killers in Baghdad, Mogadishu, 
and Sarajevo and before that in the capitals of South America 
and Southeast Asia. 
  Those who are talking about opening the road to peace via 
the 
slaughtering of Palestinians are talking about a policy that 
satisfies the new world order but does not satisfy the sentiment 
of millions of Arabs, whose Islam and Christianity as well as 
their basic rights, foremost of which is their right to live, 
are fought by Zionism and its allies. The United Nations, which 
refuses to condemn the Zionist crime, is not to blame, because 
there are those among us who, since the first moment of the 
massacre, have been seeking to acquit the Israeli Government and 
Army and lay all the blame on one settler called Goldstein 
without any reference to his many accomplices. 
  Those who are laying all this blame on Goldstein are 
demanded 
to respect the blood of martyrs if they do not want to respect 
the peoples' intelligence. They are also demanded to frankly 
read the files of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres, in the chest 
of each of whom dwell one hundred Goldsteins. Zionist extremism 
and the desire to liquidate and wipe out all Palestinian people 
in order to achieve peace are not the ideas and behavior of one 
settler. They are the ideas and behavior of an entire entity 
that was brought up under Western imperialism, specifically U.S. 
imperialism. Here it is practicing what this imperialism has 
been practicing since the beginning of this century. The 
international community, which is watching our annihilation with 
all this bias, will not secure protection for the Palestinians 
by sending a few hundred international observers.

<F P=106> [Report by Nasir 'Arif] </F>
  [Text] Ziyad Abu-Ghanimah [former Islamic Action Front 
leader] has strongly attacked the Muslim Brotherhood, accusing 
the group of arrogance in dealing with those who work in the 
Islamic field. 
  He charged that, for the last 45 years, the group has failed 
to develop from the domination of individuals, differing from 
one leader to another, to collective institutional action based 
on established plans, bylaws, and restrictions that are not 
influenced by changes in posts or the officials in charge. 
  Abu-Ghanimah criticized the Muslim Brotherhood leadership, 
of 
which he used to be a member, because of their recent decision 
to exclude him from the organization and because of their 
refusal to hold a frank dialogue with him in order to serve the 
march of the group itself. 
  In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation entitled "Views and 
Experience in the Islamic Movement," he said: I had hoped that 
the brotherhood leaders would consider me the devil himself and 
come to hold talks with me, especially since they know that even 
Almighty God talked to the condemned Satan. How can they 
refrain from having a dialogue with someone who was a member of 
the Muslim Brotherhood before some of them were even born? 
  He said: I still invite them for an open dialogue anywhere 
and at any time they decide in order that the whirlpool of 
secret instructions and statements that, in most cases, lack 
truth and objectivity will end. 
  Following this, Abu-Ghanimah began to review his experience 
in the Muslim Brotherhood since late 1940's, when Jordan was -- 
like all eastern Arab states -- full of nationalist feelings 
against colonialism and Zionist ambitions and when parties drew 
the masses into these parties by transferring their nationalist 
feelings. He said he first joined the Arab Muslim Youths Party, 
which combined the principles of the Muslim Brotherhood and the 
Ba'th Party. That experience did not last for long, and he then 
joined the Muslim Brotherhood due to his religious leanings and 
his admiration for the convoys of Muslim Brotherhood mujahidin 
who were participating in jihad against Jews in Palestine. 
  Abu-Ghanimah noted that, after more than 45 years of 
experience, he feels that he is dutybound and that it is in the 
interest of the Islamic movement, particularly the Muslim 
Brotherhood, to make this review, through which he will present 
the fruit of his personal experience within the group. He 
stressed that, before this review, we should be aware of the 
following: 
  - We, as Muslims, have no doubt that the great Islam and its 
commendable teachings are infallible and everything else is 
fallible. In other words, no Muslim or Islamic movement -- 
leaders or members -- can claim they are infallible. 
  - Consequently, the Muslims -- movements and individuals -- 
may be right or may be wrong. Therefore, there is no harm if an 
Islamic movement admits its mistakes when it is wrong. This 
will raise its position among the masses and reinforce their 
confidence in it. However, the leadership who lacks confidence 
in its cadres and masses is the one that fears to reveal its 
mistakes. 
  - Addressing the negative points of, or the mistakes 
committed by, the Islamic Movement -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- 
does not at all imply vengeance or slander, as some claim. It 
is not aimed at inciting its enemies against it. Addressing the 
negative points is geared primarily toward the interest of the 
group and does not go beyond the self-criticism known in Islam 
during the era of Prophet Muhammad and his companions. 
  Abu-Ghanimah noted that it is fair to acknowledge that his 
experiences within the Muslim Brotherhood contain a great many 
positive points as well, thanks to God first; to his adherence 
to the teachings of Islam; to teaching thousands of youths, men, 
and women on the path of Islam; to reviving the call for Islam 
at the beginning of the century; and to enlightening the Muslims 
on their decisive issues. 
  Abu-Ghanimah then touched on the negative points he 
registered throughout his time as a member of the Muslim 
Brotherhood. 
  We should be brave and admit that the Brotherhood's 
experience in Jordan has not been perfect and we should admit 
the mistakes. We should not hide behind the argument that every 
movement keeps secrets to conceal its negative aspects and 
mistakes. These negative aspects, which I recorded though my 
experience with the Muslim Brotherhood, can be summed up in the 
following points: 
  - One of the most complicated problems facing the Muslim 
Brotherhood is the fact that it lacks an authoritative reference 
to record the history of the group from the time it was founded 
in 1944 until now. 
  - The group lacks a system to assess its march in the 
various 
phases. Throughout the 45 years of its life, not a single study 
to appraise its progress has been conducted for any of the 
phases through which the group in Jordan had passed. This is a 
major shortcoming because an appraisal every now and then will 
reveal the positive and negative aspects and serve the group's 
march. 
  - Members of the group will not accept any criticism of them 
or their group, whether that criticism comes from a friend or a 
foe, to the extent that they consider any criticism against 
their group to be directed against Islam itself. 
  - The group deals with other people working in the field of 
Islamic action in a patronizing and arrogant manner. It wants 
them to be subordinates and not comrades in the march to serve 
Islam. This negative aspect, which the Muslim Brotherhood in 
Jordan is still facing, explains the gap between the group and 
their Muslim brothers in other groups. 
  - Throughout the 45 years of its life, the group has failed 
to institutionalize its action. This means it failed to 
transform group actions from an individualistic basis, which may 
differ from one leadership to another, into institutionalized 
actions that are based on mission-oriented institutions that do 
not change with the change in leadership positions or the 
persons responsible for the Brotherhood's work. All attempts to 
change the Brotherhood's work from individual efforts into 
institutionalized ones have failed. 
  - Despite the importance of the media in the missionary, 
intellectual, political, and social work of the group, the 
Muslim Brotherhood failed to follow a clear media policy with a 
practical mechanism that depends on an institutional media organ 
to cover the requirements of the group in the media field. 
  - In addition to the weak performance of the Muslim 
Brotherhood in the field of education and the increasing daring 
in slandering one another, the phenomenon of loyalty to 
individuals, rather than to the Islamic call or to the group, 
has prevailed. It is important to note as well the group's 
tendency to make decisions that please the decisionmakers. Many 
decisions made by the group leadership proceeded from personal 
whims and were not in the interest of the group. 
  Abu-Ghanimah concluded his lecture by saying that his 
frankness will anger some and please others, noting that he will 
not be swayed by angry responses since he believes that he is 
telling the truth. He said: I advise the small clique in the 
leadership, who will not appreciated my words, to react to what 
I said by thinking long and hard about these negative aspects, 
to study them, to discuss their causes, and to rectify them. If 
they fail to correct matters they should leave their jobs before 
the problems increase and the situation worsens. 
  At the end of the lecture, Dr. As'ad 'Abd-al-Rahman, 
moderator of the symposium, opened a dialogue between the 
lecturer and the audience. Abu-Ghanimah said the negative 
points he mentioned are the ones that he can address publicly, 
adding that the members of the group themselves are talking 
about many other things. This frank talk will not please many 
members of the group. He added that there are many things that 
must be kept within the group. 
  Asked if this public criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood 
will 
develop the performance of the group and help it continue its 
march, Abu-Ghanimah said: This should render the group a great 
service of which it has been in need for the last 45 years.

situation in the occupied Arab territories, the region, and the 
peace process. 
  Mr. al-Shar' pointed to the unending obstacles Israel places 
in the path of peace, and its lack of seriousness in the search 
for a fair and comprehensive peace in the region. Europe's 
potential role in the peace process and Syrian-EU cooperation 
was also discussed. [passage omitted]

al-Asad received Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, 
current chairman of the European Union [EU], and the delegation 
accompanying him. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and the Greek 
ambassador attended. 
  Papoulias handed a letter to the president from Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou dealing with the peace process and 
bilateral relations. Papoulias expressed the condolences of the 
EU Council of Ministers on the death of Staff Major Basil 
al-Asad. Talks then centered on the peace process in the region, 
as well as the EU delegation's mission on its current tour. 
  President al-Asad stressed Syria's support for the peace 
process despite Israel's unserious stand on the peace process 
and despite doubts about Israel's seriousness. The president 
also recalled that Syria has repeatedly called for an active 
European role to help the peace process achieve progress. 
  The EU delegation, which was headed by Greek Foreign 
Minister 
Karolos Papoulias, current chairman of the EU, and which 
included EU Commissioner General Hans Van den Broek, left 
Damascus this afternoon after a two-day visit to Syria. They

Minister Faruq al-Shar', Assistant Foreign Minister Yusuf 
Shakkur, several senior Foreign Ministry officials, and the 
Greek ambassador in Damascus and the embassy staff. 
  In a statement to SANA correspondent, Papoulias said: My 
visit to Syria was very constructive and positive. I met with 
President Hafiz al-Asad in my capacity as chairman of the EU 
Council of Ministers. I also met with Vice President 
'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. A 
cordial and warm atmosphere prevailed in all these meetings. He 
added: At these meetings we discussed a series of issues, 
foremost of which is the situation in the region, the 
possibility of promoting the peace process, and EU- Syrian 
relations. Papoulias also said: In my capacity as Greece's 
foreign minister, we discussed bilateral relations. The results 
of these talks were very good, and I will convey the concepts 
and views of the Syrian leaders to my colleagues, the foreign 
ministers of the EU member states. All these views are very 
important and will help us make decisions at the EU regarding 
future steps we will take.

  [Text] Damascus, 7 Mar (SANA)-- A delegation of Palestinian 
Arab personalities, led by [Member of the Israeli Knesset, MK] 
'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah arrived in Damascus from Cairo this 
afternoon to offer condolences on the death of Staff Major Basil 
al-Asad. 
  The delegation was received at the Damascus International 
Airport by Khalid al-Fahum, head of the Palestinian National 
Salvation Front, and Muhammad Walid Hammamiyah, the governor of 
Damascus. 
  In a statement to journalists, Darawshah expressed happiness 
to be in Syria, his second homeland, this Arab country known for 
its history, deep roots, heroism, and sacrifices for the 
Palestine question and the Arab nation. 
  He said: We have come to offer sincere condolences to His 
Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and his family, to the Syrian 
Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people whose positions 
we greatly appreciate. This is the main objective of the visit 
to Syria, and we thank the Syrian Government, led by President 
al-Asad, for allowing us to enter the Syrian land. This is 
something we are proud of. 
  Answering a question, Darawshah said: We are not carrying 
any political message and we do not represent any official 
stance in Israel. We represent the Palestinians in the Galilee, 
in the Negev, and other cities. We are proud to be a part of 
the Palestinian people. Our visit to Syria today entrenches our 
affiliation to this deep-rooted nation. We have not bowed and 
our heads remain high, and we are proud of our homeland and of 
our Arab and Palestinian affiliation. 
  Answering another question, Darawshah said: We have not come 
here for negotiations but to offer condolences. This is our 
noble objective. 
  In reply to another question, Darawshah said: The horrible 
massacre that took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and the 
subsequent suppression and atrocities, have increased the number 
of Palestinian martyrs and injured, and aggravated the 
situation. The Israeli Government is responsible for this 
escalation. The Israeli Government should embark on practical 
measures to prevent the continuation of settlers' aggressions 
against the Palestinians by disarming these settlers and 
removing the settlements from the occupied Arab territories. 
  Concluding his statement, Darawshah said: Our position has 
always been the same as the position of the Palestinians, and 
this position is identical with the Syrian position and the Arab 
position in general. We want to end the occupation and we 
support an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil, 
and we call for full withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories and from the Syrian Golan, which we consider an 
inseparable part of Syria. 
  Before leaving Cairo, Darawshah said: We, as part of the 
Palestinian people and the Arab nation, decided that it is a 
pan-Arab and humanitarian duty to offer condolences to President 
Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Basil.

<F P=106> [Address by President Hafiz al-Asad thanking the Syrian </F>
people for their expressions of sympathy on the death of his 
son, Basil, in Damascus on 7 Mar--live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Beloved citizens, I address you today to express my love and to 
thank you for everything you have shown over the past days in 
terms of your sincere emotions and condolences over the painful 
loss of the late Basil. 
  From the day when Basil left this earth to face his creator, 
I have been constantly preoccupied with two things: Basil's 
departure and your sensitive and noble stand and sentiments, 
which covered the entire country, filled every town and village, 
and clearly manifested itself all over our land. This 
remarkable phenomenon, with its national and human dimensions, 
attracted the attention of people outside the country. It won 
appreciation and admiration in terms of its noble and sincere 
meaning and its manifestation of national unity. Sincere people 
who are cohesive in weal and woe, in happy and sad times, are 
always able to build their country, develop their life, and 
realize, defend, and preserve their aspirations. 
  I have been engrossed by two things from the very beginning. 
One was Basil's departure, because I am a father and any father 
is pained by the death of his son. However, I was not saddened 
only because he was my son. He possessed many talents, 
capabilities, and characteristics that surfaced in him from his 
childhood and grew over the years and reached an advanced stage 
of ripeness, firmness, and clarity. At this advanced stage and 
at 32, the peak of his youth and activity, Basil left this life, 
his people, and homeland. I am not going to enumerate his 
talents and capabilities. This may be done at a later time. 
Basil left many friends and comrades who knew and lived with 
him and who knew a lot about him. However, they did not know 
him as his father did who lived with him for 32 years. 
  Basil had a pure, spotless, and unambiguous nationalist 
upbringing. The homeland is sacred. It deserves more than 
anything else all kinds of supreme sacrifices. This is a 
fateful, moral, human, and religious issue that does not wane 
and grow as time poasses, but remains as constant as time and as 
strong as the continuity of life on earth. It is a cause that 
is above all other causes and whose justice is above all other 
types of justice, a cause that makes everything that serves it 
an accepted possibility and a duty. It is the homeland whose 
air we breath, whose water we drink, and whose food we eat. In 
light of all this, love and unity grow among its homeland. 
  Hence, and stemming from this concept, Basil loved his 
mates, friends, and fellow citizens. From this concept came 
Basil's optimism and confidence in the future of the homeland 
and people. Thus, he loved benevolent deeds and loved to serve 
both the people and the public interest. 
  Basil reacted with the community and loved the people. He 
was a brother of each youth in this homeland and a faithful 
friend of each citizen who actively worked to serve everyone. 
Basil did this whenever an opportunity was available, whenever 
he could support a man in need or anyone who was done an 
injustice, and whenever he could stand against those who did 
injustice to others and encroached on others' rights, directly 
or indirectly. 
  All this and much more attracted me to both Basil and his 
departure. What attracted me much to you, beloved brothers, was 
your great stand, your great sympathy and the extension of 
condolences, and your understanding that the event was a general 
one and that it concerned everyone. Your understanding was 
correct and embodied nobility, faithfulness, and patriotism. 
  Beloved ones, we have long reciprocated love and shared 
concerns and burdens. We will continue to do so as long as we 
are alive, so our coming generations will inherit our 
humanitarian, social, and national values, with God's help. 
What relieved the sorrow was your genuine sympathy -- men, 
women, and children. This was the source of real consolation. 
  Brothers and sons, the true sentiments you have shown are 
beyond description. I can find no words to express my 
impressions about what I saw, sensed, and heard in the past 
days. I wish I could shake hands and talk to you, one by one, 
in order to express to each of you my gratitude and appreciation 
for this great stand. However, you know that the time factor 
and vast distances would preclude this. 
  I was unequivocally confident that your sentiments toward me 
were genuine. Through your deep sympathy for the painful event 
which took place, you once again confirmed the genuine character 
of our great people, who have always proved this character on 
all occasions, whether happy or sad. This has consolidated and 
further entrenched national unity. As I always say, national 
unity is our sharpest and most important weapon in confronting 
all challenges and calamities of life. 
  What I saw with my own eyes when we left home on our way to 
the airport to take the body to the burial ground embodied the 
meaning that I have mentioned. From my home to the airport, 
people gathered along both sides of the road. Nobody gathered 
them there. Nobody, including members of the household among 
whom Basil lived, knew what time we were to leave because the 
departure time was connected with a number of details. The 
people who gathered along the streets were not spectators. 
Sadness was clear on the faces of everyone, men and women. 
They were either crying or raising their hands in prayer. In 
more than one place, I saw a number of men collapse on the 
ground. 
  These sad and grave scenes all along the road made our souls 
more sublime. Deep sadness engenders strength and determination 
to be patient as if this is the purport of God's wisdom when he 
counseled patience and brought good tidings to the patient. 
  With this faith, I faced the disaster when I was informed of 
it by the minister of defense, the chief of staff, and the 
foreign minister who came to my house. Everyone of you can 
imagine the impact of such a shock. After they answered my 
queries, I told them: God be praised. God has given and God 
has taken. Basil's demise is a great loss. One of them said it 
was a national loss. I said: That is what I think. Let us 
rely on God. 
  The slogans which were raised everywhere, repeating phrases 
such as: We Are All Basil, We Are all Your Sons, have left 
deep, and immense impression on our hearts. Rest assured that I 
share this feeling with you from the bottom of my heart. For 
me, each citizen in this country is either a son or a brother, 
just like Basil. We are one big family and you are all my sons 
and brothers of whom I am very proud and on whose originality, 
zeal, and boldness I rely when the need arises. 
  I send my sincerest love, thanks, and appreciation to all 
of you, beloved citizens, men and women, at home and abroad; 
party members and officials of parties and of state; officers 
and NCO's in the Armed Forces; men of religion and ulema; 
members of popular, professional organizations, and trade 
unions; university professors, teachers, and students; all the 
sportsmen, knights, and youths; people in towns and in the 
countryside; and all sectors of the people. I send my love, 
thanks, and appreciation to all those who participated in any 
sad demonstration, sat in a condolences meeting, and took pains 
to go to al-Qardahah to offer condolences. I send my love and 
appreciation to anyone who joined prayers on the soul of our 
son, in his own house or at mosques; to those who prayed to God 
or read verses of the Koran; to anyone who eulogized or wrote a 
line in any cable or letter of condolences; to those who took to 
the streets and courtyards in our towns and villages, raising 
slogans of sincerity; to those who participated in any form in 
expression of sorrow over our loss, the national loss, the 
demise of the late Basil. 
  What I have seen over the past days is bright proof that in 
this country we are one big family. What saddens one, saddens 
all; what is glad, gladdens all of us. Hearts are one and arms 
are held together. The national fabric is as firm as steel. 
  Brother citizens, my permanent concern and sole ambition is 
that God may grant me the ability and strength to serve the 
homeland and the people and to carry out what we believe is for 
the good of the homeland and the nation. While increasing my 
sense of responsibility, these generous sentiments you expressed 
to me grant me further ability to exert my efforts and to 
continue work at full capacity for the sake of construction and 
liberation; constructing a decent life for the sons of our 
people, and working seriously to liberate the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  We have a lot to accomplish and immense responsibilities to 
carry out. Let us continue our march, armed with faith in God, 
and let us redouble our efforts. The people who believed in 
God, unified themselves, and resolved to regain their rights 
will surely regain them. 
  Beloved citizens. Words cannot express the feelings I have 
for you, feelings of love, appreciation, and pride. I am 
certain that we will continue our march on the path of dignity 
and serious work. I pray God to lend me his support in order to 
continue my efforts to build the homeland and its strength and 
to defend our national and pan-Arab causes. 
  I send my thanks and appreciation to the Arab kings, 
presidents, officials, and citizens who offered condolences 
either personally, by sending representatives, by telephone, or 
by sending cables and letters. I send thanks to all heads of 
state, governments, officials, and figures from all over the 
world who sent delegates, telephoned, or cabled condolences. 
  I repeat my thanks, love, and appreciation for you. I press 
your hands, beloved citizens. May God have mercy on Basil and 
may God make paradise his abode. Peace and blessings of God be 
upon you.

  [Text] Reports received from Baghdad in the past few days 
speak of widespread marches and protests, in which the citizens 
expressed their anger and rejection of the dictatorial ruling 
regime in Baghdad. The reports say that demonstrators hoisted 
banners denouncing the regime and calling for its overthrow. 
The demonstrators also called for an improvement in living 
standards. Demonstrations are reported to have taken place in 
al-Qanah, Madinat al-Thawrah, Hayy Jamilah, and other Baghdad 
neighborhoods. Iraqis from all walks of life took part in the 
protests, openly declaring their discontent with the general 
situation and particularly with economic conditions. 
  The dictatorial regime answered the masses with its 
customary 
iron fist. Its forces used all types of weapons against the 
demonstrators, killing, and wounding many. 
  In its 4 March Issue, the AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT newspaper 
reports the eruption of widespread protests. It says that more 
than 1,600 Iraqi and Arab students took part in demonstrations 
in Baghdad, protesting the regime's closure of the Arab College 
for Science and Technology, a school founded by the Arab Food 
Industry Association. 
  AL-MU'TAMAR [paper of the United National Iraqi Congress], 
in 
today's issue, Monday, cites the Iraqi Broadcasting 
Corporation's correspondent in Baghdad as saying that a strong 
explosion occurred a few days ago in front of the main gate of 
al-Mustansiriyah University. The explosion rocked Baghdad and 
partially wrecked a large mural of Saddam Husayn. Security 
forces rushed to the scene. The main gate of al-Mustansiriyah 
University is now closed until the damage is repaired. 
  This explosion follows a spate of attacks against patrols of 
security forces and police in all Baghdad areas during the past 
few weeks. Baghdad was also the scene of a wave of bombings. 
Gas stations in al-Thawrah and Abu Ghurayb were bombed in late 
February. The storage tanks of both stations caught fire, 
leading to explosions that were heard miles away. 
  In another development, reports from Baghdad cite 
well-informed sources as saying that the dictator's son-in law 
[Industry and Minerals Minister] Husayn Kamil is currently 
undergoing treatment in an Amman hospital for a gunshot wound to 
the head, not a head illness as earlier reported. 
  In Karkuk, the regime is reinforcing its forces in fear of a 
popular uprising that may jeopardize its hold on the city. Fear 
and panic are common among circles in the repressive regime. 
The local authorities are employing a variety of intimidation 
tactics to terrorize the population into submission. 
  Karkuk military commanders have instructed army patrols to 
prevent young men from al-Sulaymaniyah from travelling to Karkuk 
and Baghdad. 
  The regime has massed many troops in the Khalid barracks, as 
well as in Andik and (Naylan). On 5 March, 60 tanks arrived 
from Tikrit at the Khalid barraks near Karkuk. Infantry and a 
number of tanks have been dispatched to Jabal Bur in 
anticipation of a popular uprising in Karkuk. 
  The regime has also begun dismantling the big prefab 
installations on the side of Karkuk-Irbil road and sending them 
to (Hamuwir) and other cities under its control. 
  Reports from Karkuk also indicate that the regime arrested a 
number of retired Kurdish officers in the city. No information 
is yet available about their fate. 
  A senior official in the ruling party, during a recent visit 
to (al-Hawijah), expressed concern that a popular uprising is 
brewing in Karkuk. The air is rife with tension and uncertainty 
in that city, and regime forces have assumed positions at key 
junctures as well as hilltops. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk 
has been evacuated and a curfew is in force in the areas of 
Azabi, al-Sharja, and al-Iskan. Many citizens have been 
arrested. 
  In another development, many of the regime's servicemen in 
Mosul are reportedly afraid of the possibility of a popular 
uprising erupting in that city. To confront the situation, the 
regime sent troops armed with field artillery to al-Nu'maniyah 
and Ba'shiqah.

  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi opposition 
statements yesterday spoke of "tumultuous uprisings" in more 
than one Iraqi region and of military operations and scorched 
earth campaigns by the government of Baghdad. 
  A statement issued by the "Iraqi National Accord" 
Organization said that the masses in Baghdad, al-Basrah, 
al-'Amarah, and al-Nasiriyah staged a furious "uprising" 
[intifadah] last Thursday. The statement, issued in 
Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, said that the "uprising" began in 
the areas of al-Thawrah, al-Hurriyah, and al-Shu'lah and then 
extended to al-Taji, al-Dulu'iyah, Samarra', al-Dujayl, and 
al-Dawr. The masses managed to control the Baghdad-al-Mawsil 
road. 
  The statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT in London, added that some areas in the governorates of 
al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah later joined the 
"uprising" and that the protesters were in control of several 
areas between Baghdad and Samarra' and fought fierce battles 
against the Tammuz Division which consists of emergency forces 
and Republican Guards -- the forces deployed by the government 
in Baghdad since last Wednesday. 
  Another statement issued by the Organization of "the 
Mujahidin of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq" said that the 
Baghdad government "has completed preparations for a new attack 
on the marshes areas in the governorates of al-Basrah and 
Maysan." 
  The statement added that these preparations followed heavy 
artillery bombardment of various areas, using napalm and 
incendiary bombs to destroy the plantations which acted as 
barriers. It also said that last Wednesday a large armored 
force joined the commando units of the 14th Division in some 
areas in Maysan. 
  Government forces had set fire to some areas in al-Hayadir 
in 
al-Basrah Governorate on 27 February, and the 1st and 2d 
battalions of the 47th Brigade moved toward al-Saddah-712 in 
al-Hayadir area on 3 March. Fires were seen raging in the 
sugarcane fields adjacent to the main road.

  [Text] Damascus, 7 March -- An Iraqi opposition movement 
today warned the international community that the Iraqi regime 
was planning to launch a large-scale attack against northern 
Iraq fearing a popular uprising there. According to a press 
statement released here by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
[PUK], the regime's leadership started to mass large numbers of 
infantry and tanks east of the city of Karkuk along the front 
line with the Kurdish forces. It was also stockpiling weapons 
and equipment, and transporting about 60 tanks from the city of 
Tikrit to the Khalid military camp near Karkuk. The statement 
cited a party official in the regime, Muhammad Hasan al-Zubaydi, 
as having told the inhabitants of (al-Hujah) area that "the 
regime is worried about the possibility of a popular uprising in 
the city of Karkuk and its environs and calls on all to arm 
themselves to defend the city." The statement added: We bring 
the attention of world public opinion, those concerned about 
human rights and friends to the adverse consequences and the 
monstrous massacres that could take place if the regime succeeds 
in carrying out its plans against the northern areas. The 
statement also reported that the regime had recently arrested a 
group of retired military men in the city of Karkuk; their fate 
was still unknown. The regime's authorities had also planted a 
large number of agents in the midst of the people of the city 
and increased its military presence fearing a popular explosion 
against it. In another statement the Iraqi opposition movement 
said that the aircraft of the Iraqi regime had recently bombed 
the (Albu Namr) tribe in the area of (Hiziri) which is part of 
Ramadi Province, as a result of which many members of the tribe 
were killed or injured.

<F P=106> [Speech by Dr. Ilyas Farah, official in charge of the </F>
Cultural and Information Bureau of the National Command of the 
Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, at the Party Preparation School, 
date not given: "The Hope and Challenge Session"] 
  [Excerpts] Dear comrades, students of the Hope and 
Challenge Session. 
  In the name of the Cultural and Information Bureau and on 
behalf of the comrade bureau directors and members, I am pleased 
to extend our congratulations to you on the conclusion of your 
28th session. In as much as it is an occasion to express your 
joy, it is also an occasion to recall your experiences during 
the short period of this course and to conclude lessons for the 
future. [passage omitted] 
  "Hope and Challenge" is the title of a strategy that stems 
from historical awareness of the events in the present phase -- 
crucial events in rare and extraordinary circumstances. This 
historical, principled awareness exposes weak analyses and 
political theories that judge events in the superficial 
traditional way that sees the near and distant Arab future only 
through U.S. and Zionist analyses and the influence of Western 
propaganda. They portray the Arab situation as a vacuum that 
cannot be filled by a nation with history or created by struggle. 
  Therefore, the comrade graduates of this course are called 
upon, now that they have acquired qualitative ideological 
weapons from the spirit of the Mother of Battles, to face these 
political and ideological challenges with historical logic 
backed by scientific thought, struggle spirit, and cultural 
heritage. The speech by the comrade leader on the third 
anniversary of the 30-state aggression crowns all the 
intellectual efforts exerted after the Mother of Battles to 
provide full answers to the questions presented by Arab destiny 
and the national, Arab, and international future. 
  You, comrades, are humanity's vanguard on the path of 
straightening out ideology and cleansing souls and spirits of 
all the corruption in the universe, thereby declaring the 
inevitable downfall of the cultural structure, which lacks moral 
bases and human spirit. You are the builders of a new 
civilization, just as your forefathers were the first builders 
of civilization. As in the dawn of human history, Iraq today is 
a great teacher of history, civilization, and struggle. It is a 
living embodiment of the spirit of the vision, and the immortal 
meanings of patriotism, nationalism, and humanitarianism. This 
is a starting point for a decisive, historical transformation in 
the life of the nation and the modern world. 
  Congratulations to you and to Iraq for alerting mankind to 
the reality of a changing conspiratorial world, foiling the 
electronic war game, and exposing U.S. victory claims by 
preventing the evil 30-station aggression from undermining our 
great principled steadfastness, cultural struggle, and material 
and spiritual reconstruction whose miracles have been achieved 
on the land of Iraq under the leadership of the hero of Iraq and 
the nation comrade leader Saddam Husayn. [passage omitted] 
  Comrades, the theorization taking place today about the 
superior American way of life, "the Zionist era," and "the 
American age" or "Americanism" is only a distortion of 
civilization and an expression of delusions based on half 
truths. This is in addition to its inherent weaknesses, moral 
regression, and cultural alienation . 
  "Americanism", which seeks to generalize the American way of 
life, is founded on three bases: 
  1. Superiority, challenge, and violence as reflected by the 
cowboy mentality, to quote Quincey Wright. 
  2. Bigotry based on race and Protestant religious values. 
  3. Expediency which believes in the relativity of values and 
uses success as a standard for truth. 
  These bases make the American feel he is the master of 
standards. The double-dealing that permeates U.S. morality, the 
exploitation of freedom as applied to money matters and the 
media, and the compromise of values make everything in the 
American way of life, even honor and sovereignty, subject to 
bargain and compromise. Under such pragmatism, life itself 
becomes a series of deals. 
  Thus, war is a deal; peace is a deal; persuading others to 
surrender and accept established facts is a deal;, publicizing 
and marketing liberal democracy and human rights to turn 
political and economic institutions into annexes for the U.S. 
capitalist system is a deal; considering religion, patriotism, 
and nationalism as fundamentalism which must be avoided; 
publicizing Western secularism and internationalist trends; 
opening up fronts against nationalism, Arabism, and Islam; 
advocating common strategies to fight Arab awakening and to 
Americanize and Judaize life in the world are all deals. 
  There is only one starting point for facing this aggressive 
American model which serves Zionist aims: namely, the Mother of 
Battles' spirit, rationalism, renewed unity principles, true 
democracy, and socialism based on lessons learned from world 
experiments which express true human tendencies and address the 
needs of national awakening. The Mother of Battles embodies the 
alternative Arab cultural model which can, in a balanced and 
integrated manner, interact with ideology and technology, 
revolution and wealth, and Man and his humanitarian mission, 
because the Mother of Battles is a spark from the mission's 
spirit, the Ba'thist spirit. 
  You, the sons of the Mother of Battles, have the 
responsibility to build this new cultural model and to defend it 
with intellect, struggle, construction, creativeness and by 
raising the nation's struggle power to the point where it can 
settle the historic confrontation in favor of Arabism and human 
civilization. You are qualified to assume this responsibility. 
I congratulate you and wish you great success in your struggle 
tasks under the principled historical leadership of leader 
comrade Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him. Peace be upon you.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA) -- The Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party and the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party have denounced 
the unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. They said the 
blockade is considered a means to intervene in Iraqi internal 
affairs and runs contrary to all international charters and 
agreements, heavenly laws, and human rights. 
  In a joint communique, signed for the Ba'th Party by the 
director of the Iraq Command's Foreign Relations Bureau and for 
the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party by party leader Veslin 
Koshev, the two parties call for the lifting of the unjust 
blockade, which has been imposed on Iraq for more than three 
years, for respecting Iraqi sovereignty and independence, and 
for respecting its people's free will. 
  The communique noted the need to improve the ties of 
cooperation between the two parties through the exchange of 
delegations, visits, publications, and circulars to serve the 
common interests of the two friendly peoples and strengthen ties 
between them in all fields. 
  The communique further urges the need for coordination and 
cooperation between the two parties in national, regional, and 
international conferences to expose the allegations and claims 
of the world media and the tendentious propaganda; to reject all 
forms of aggression, hegemony, exploitation, and the double 
standards policy in addressing world problems; to serve the 
principles of progress, freedom, and social justice; to realize 
security and peace among nations; and to ensure respect for 
international law.

  [Text] Iraq has lodged a fresh protest with the United 
Nations against Iraqi airspace violations by U.S. aircraft for 
purposes of surveillance and harassment, and to drop flares. 
  A protest memorandum delivered to the UN secretary general 
by 
the Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations 
yesterday stated that U.S. aircraft conducted 421 air sorties 
over Iraqi territory during period 21-28 February. U.S. 
aircraft flew at medium altitudes over areas in northern and 
southern Iraq, including Mosul, Irbil, Dahuk, Zakho, 
al-Nasiriyah, al-Samawah, al-'Amarah, al-Basrah, Artawi, 
al-Diwaniyah, Qal'at Salih, and al-Qusayr. 
  The memorandum noted that a hostile plane dropped three 
flares over al-Shaykhan District in Ninawa Governorate on 24 
February. On 26 February, TR-1 U.S. reconnaissance aircraft 
violated Iraqi airspace over al-Samawah, al-'Amarah, southern 
al-Diwaniyah, al-Qurnah, and al-Basrah. Then, they headed for 
Saudi Arabia. 
  Iraq requested that this memorandum be circulated as a UN 
Security Council document.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd al-Jabbar Muhsin: "Contribution to the </F>
Question of Lifting the Blockade"] 
  [Text] During the roundtable discussion on lifting the 
blockade that aired on Youth Television, several valuable 
opinions were expressed on the subject. So there may not be 
anything new in this article. Still, I will try to highlight 
some of the points of that discussion. We will observe that the 
Mother of Battles began essentially as an economic aggression 
manifested by an undeclared embargo on several commodities and 
technologies. They then plotted against the oil prices in a 
deliberate attempt to reduce Iraq's revenues when it was in dire 
need of foreign currencies. This was accompanied by a 
conspiracy against the value of the Iraqi currency. 
  Needless to say, the first to point out that these measures 
constituted a real war against us was our leader Saddam Husayn, 
may God preserve him, at the Baghdad Arab summit. After the war 
and its outcome, the West, led by the United States, persisted, 
in harmony with Zionist aims, to use different excuses to 
prolong the blockade in the hope of achieving by economic war 
what they could not achieve by force of arms. 
  With this simple introduction, I now go straight to the 
topic 
and propose the following: 
  1. We should declare that trade with any country wishing to 
deal with Iraq after the removal of the blockade will not be a 
favor to Iraq, or a friendly or fraternal stand, but a fait 
accompli stand. 
  2. Thus, our dialogue with the big powers and neighboring 
states should follow two courses: First, the course of 
intimidation, which, in short, means that there will be no 
special relationship, trade benefits, priority in debt payments, 
preference in oil supply, commodity and expertise exports to 
Iraq, or job opportunities for companies with regard to any 
country not currently adopting a just and equitable stand. 
Second, the course of temptation, which means that every 
country that says it has changed its attitude about Iraq and is 
actually endeavoring in international forums -- by word, action, 
and stand --to lift the blockade, will enjoy most favored nation 
rights regarding oil supply, and possibly with regard to 
preferential prices and debt payments. It will also benefit 
from an Iraqi market that hungers for foreign commodities, and 
in the opportunities given to foreign companies. We could, in 
this regard, sign immediate agreements. 
  3. Since hostile circles are now diverting the blockade from 
diplomatic and media attention in order to clamp a blackout on 
this exposed crime and to prevent the formation of supporting 
public opinion, nationalist forces, social figures, professional 
organizations, and men of religion who took part in the popular 
forces conferences and the Islamic conference in Baghdad should 
take action in two directions: First, form a public pressure 
group against the aggressors in support of Iraq by all available 
means, including pulpits, statements, demonstrations, 
declarations, solidarity strikes for several hours, fasting for 
a whole day or part of a day, roundtable discussions, and news 
conferences. Otherwise, there is little use in resolutions 
issued in Baghdad and then shelved here and forgotten there. 
Second, use these methods in calling for the boycott of 
American goods and interests in the Arab and Islamic states. I 
believe such calls will find a response even among our people in 
the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf states. 
  4. The enemies are betting that the phenomenon of the rising 
price spiral that some merchants cause from time to time will 
exhaust people's patience, deepen their concern, and destroy 
their morale. All I am asking is for these elements, whether 
they are individuals or groups, to be singled out and punished 
on the basis of the revolutionary code of fairness in punishment 
and reward. Leaving matters unattended has given these elements 
the opportunity to continue their despicable behavior in 
defiance of the people and the revolution. 
  5. These proposals require active support on the diplomatic, 
media, party, and professional levels. We know decisionmakers 
at all these levels are truly strong and competent, and the 
outsiders have weak excuses. Therefore, until the blockade is 
lifted, we should choose elements with a high sense of 
responsibility and on the basis of competence and sincerity, not 
favoritism. 
  Finally, these proposals may not be the right ones, but they 
are suitable as a basis for discussion.

bought and sold through the branches of the licensed commercial 
banks in Baghdad and the governorates and through the companies 
licensed to buy and sell foreign currencies. 
  In a statement to INA, the source said that these branches

citizens buy and sell foreign currencies easily and in a 
legitimate way. Such dealings, the source added, will also 
ensure a safe dealing in national and foreign currencies.

  [Text] The Iraqi Ministry of Transport has canceled all 
contracts with Jordanian transportation firms. Observers say 
this measure will paralyze a large sector of the Jordanian 
economy. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has learned that Iraq will confine 
transportation to the Iraqi-Jordanian Land Transport Company. 
Iraq did not explain this measure or announce it; it 
implemented it on the ground. Sources told us that Jordanian 
transportation firms are trying to take a unified stand and 
address the Jordanian and Iraqi Governments in order to explain 
the extent of damage they will sustain. 
  It is noteworthy that approximately 80 percent of these 
firms' work is devoted to Iraq. This shows the size of this 
problem. Truck drivers are living in extremely difficult 
conditions at the Iraqi-Jordanian border area of al-Ruwayshid. 
AKHIR KHABAR has learned that world television networks will 
today begin to raise this problem as a political issue, taking 
pictures of the al- Ruwayshid area.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar: "1958 Union Anniversary; </F>
Mother of Battles; Arab Unity"] 
  [Text] Today is the birthday of the first Arab union in 
contemporary history -- the United Arab Republic -- a name that 
plays upon the heart strings of Arab nationalists. The United 
Arab Republic was the product of a merger between Egypt and 
Syria and the struggle and sacrifices of the Arab masses. It 
came about as the result of the historic agreement between the 
late Jamal 'Abd-al- Nasir and the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. 
  Those of us who experienced that major, historic, and 
memorable event must recall it with great pride. It was the 
fulfillment of a dream cherished by successive generations and 
thousands of Arab martyrs. It dealt a body blow to the satanic 
alliance between the Zionist movement and British-led Western 
colonialism. 
  Having labored for decades under British and French 
colonialism and for much longer under the Ottoman Empire, Arabs 
-- spearheaded by Ba'thist militants allied with Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir -- rose from the ruins of repeated defeat. They 
took a determined stand against a Zionist-Western alliance bent 
on keeping Arabs divided and on looting their resources. 
  The tide of pan-Arab liberation had to contend with Western 
manipulated Arab regimes that were lying in wait to abort the 
Arab nationalist policies. While some such regimes played up to 
Arab nationalists in the hope of containing them, others 
resorted to the more direct approach of repressing and 
liquidating Arab militants fighting for freedom and Arab unity. 
Thus, a bitter struggle began, pitting anti-colonialist, 
progressive Arab liberation forces against the 
colonialist-Zionist camp, aided by reactionary and agent Arab 
dictatorships. 
  With huge resources at the disposal of the enemies and the 
inexperience of the new unionist state, colonialism plotted the 
retrogressive secessionist coup of 28 September, 1961, setting 
the stage for a campaign to contain the Arab liberation movement 
and drown it in a sea of blood. Hence the string of crimes 
committed against the standard bearers of Arab nationalism by 
the reactionary and hireling Arab regimes, some of which, thanks 
to their imperialist backers, are still in power. 
  Arab unionists must never lose sight of the fact that the 
first Arab unionist experiment would not have failed if it had 
not been for reactionary Arab dictatorships that had been 
recruited by Zionism and colonialism to strike at Arab unity. 
  With the foremost colonialist power of the day contending 
that it wants to spread democracy and human rights, we should 
remind our younger generation that by wrecking the 
Syrian-Egyptian merger, the West and the United States took a 
stand against democracy. 
  We feel we must point out that the Mother of Battles counts 
as the most decisive and far-reaching in the history of Arab 
struggle. If Zionism and colonialism assassinated 
Egyptian-Syrian unity, Ba'thist militants, led by Saddam Husayn, 
holding the banner of Arabism, and armed with the lessons 
learned from that rich experiment, achieved a major victory in 
the Mother of Battles against the U.S.-led Western forces of 
evil. 
  Our victory in the Mother of Battles is not limited to a 
single front, as some may think. Three years after the 
aggression, the hostile forces have begun to admit that Iraq 
scored a series of victories. Militarily, Iraq was able to 
deter America and its allies from pursuing the land war. More 
importantly, Iraq won the battle of wills by thwarting the U.S. 
effort to invade its territory and liquidate its leadership. 
Furthermore, the United States failed to destroy Iraq's 
industrial base. Strategically, the U.S. effort to gain control 
over the oil of the world and use the crude as a political and 
economic weapon against its enemies has also failed. The credit 
belongs to Iraq, which managed to neutralize oil as a weapon. 
  The generation led by Saddam Husayn has learned the lesson 
of 
the aborted union and set up a pan-Arab experiment that survived 
the labors of birth and then firmed up its foundations. It is 
now a lighthouse showing the way for freedom- and 
independence-lovers around the world. Iraq's pan-Arab 
experiment is the proper response to all Arab defeats, not least 
Syria's secession from Egypt in 1961. 
  Hail to all the militants who presided over the 1958 union, 
led by Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. 
  Let the faithful who defended the honor of Arabism and Islam 
in the Mother of Battles hold firmly to and raise the banner of 
Arab unity. 
  Hail to the great militant Saddam Husayn who succeeded in 
realizing the most widespread and deepest Arab unity that was 
apparent in the Arab masses rallying around his excellency's 
pan- Arab banner.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Friendly Reproach"] </F>
  [Text] When sisterly Qatar stood with us during the ordeal 
of the brutal Iraqi invasion, this was not merely aimed at 
extending help in a time of need. When Qatari forces had the 
honor to confront the Iraqi aggression, this was no coincidence 
but was part of the principled and honorable position of 
sisterly Qatar. 
  In this, its singular position toward its oppressed brother 
during the ordeal of the invasion of Kuwait, Qatar clearly 
expressed its stand in a manner that showed noble and pure 
fraternity and deep and strong relations. Qatar offered all it 
could to support justice. Toward that objective, Qatar extended 
everything it had in order to defeat the aggression and restore 
Kuwaiti rights. Kuwait's ordeal demonstrated the status of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] and reflected the closeness of 
relations among its states. 
  Now, three years after the liberation of Kuwait and the 
restoration of legitimacy, much of the credit for which goes to 
the GCC states, and with our national celebrations, which are 
also celebrations for all those who contributed to the 
liberation of our country, it is difficult to see sisterly Qatar 
opening its windows to the aggressor so that the aggressor can 
spread its poisons and use these windows as a means to improve 
its image and win the sympathy of others. 
  If the brothers in Qatar are hurt by the suffering of the 
Iraqi people, our hurt in Kuwait is no less than theirs. Our 
sufferings increase with the continuation of this regime because 
we knew that regime and lived with it for seven months. We also 
know that a human being is worthless according to its hateful 
Ba'thist ideology. 
  This regime is still practicing its oppression despite all 
the international sanctions imposed on it after its sinful 
aggression. Instead of receiving Qatar's help against the 
oppressor, as we used to expect from Qatar, we were surprised to 
see the sinful aggressor appear in the brothers' media, as if he 
is mocking us, our solidarity, the pure blood that had been 
spilled, and the international resolutions that have been 
adopted. 
  Our love for Qatar and appreciation of its principled 
positions toward us allow us to reproach it in the spirit of 
family -- a family that we are both part of and of which we are 
proud to be a member. This reproach is a friendly one that 
expresses our hope that the brothers will reconsider their 
positions toward the one who has harmed and suppressed his own 
people, as well as our people, and continues to do so. 
  It is a friendly reproach from a wounded heart that can bear 
no more injuries.

  [Text] Sanaa, 7 Mar (INA)--The Yemeni joint military 
committee has failed to persuade the commanders of some Yemeni 
brigades to return to their old positions outside al-Bayda' 
Governorate in accordance with the authorization the committee 
obtained from the Yemeni president and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid to end the military tensions between northern and 
southern Yemeni troops. 
  The newspaper AL-MUSTAQBAL, mouthpiece of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, today reported that the committee, which also 
includes Jordanian and Omani military officers, had to leave 
al-Bayda' Governorate without ending the tension there. 
  The troops, which the committee failed to return to their 
original positions, were brought into al-Bayda' Governorate from 
various Yemeni towns following the military friction that has 
been going on since 20 February between southern units loyal to 
the Yemeni Socialist Party and northern units. They include the 
56th Armored Brigade and two other brigades, as well as units 
from the Central Security Forces and a Republican Guard 
battalion. 
  The paper notes that the military committee's failure in 
al-Bayda' Governorate heralds other failures in other areas.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, this morning received brother 
Colonel Mustafa al-Kharrubi, member of the Revolution Command 
Council and inspector general in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah. 
The Libyan envoy conveyed to the brother chairman a message 
from his brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 
Libyan 1 September revolution. The message deals with the 
brotherly and militant relations between the two countries, as 
well as issues and developments of interest to the Arab nation. 
The message also deals with the current developments in our 
country and the efforts being exerted by brother Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in Libya to bring views closer 
and to heal the rift in the Yemeni ranks in order to maintain 
the march of unity, democracy, and stability in Yemen. The 
message stresses the Libyan brothers' eagerness to support all 
efforts and do whatever is possible to contain the current 
political crisis in our country, to halt its regrettable 
repercussions, and to stand by our people to surmount the 
current challenges and maintain Yemeni unity, which is a major 
pan-Arab gain and a model for realizing the Arab masses' dreams 
of Arab unity. 
  During the meeting, the two sides reviewed their brotherly 
bilateral relations, the developments of the situation in our 
country in light of the efforts being exerted by the military 
committee to halt the regrettable military developments, and the 
efforts being exerted to begin implementation of the accord 
document. Those efforts are designed to end the crisis and 
enable the state's constitutional institutions to resume their 
responsibilities so that they can move collectively to implement 
the contents of the document in a manner that ensures its 
success, achieves the national aspirations for a modern Yemeni 
state, and entrenches unity and democracy in our country. 
  During the meeting, the Presidential Council chairman 
expressed thanks and appreciation for the efforts, the sincere 
fraternal sentiments, and the outstanding pan-Arab eagerness of 
his brother Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi and other brothers in 
Libya to help their brothers in Yemen to maintain Yemeni unity. 
He noted that the brothers in Libya had a pioneering and 
positive role in enhancing the march of unity from the outset 
and in supporting all the steps and efforts toward unity that 
led to the establishment of the Republic of Yemeni and the 
restoration of Yemeni unity on 22 May 1990. He indicated that 
Yemeni unity is a pan-Arab accomplishment and an Arab enterprise 
of interest to all advocates of unity and good in the Arab 
homeland. He added that maintaining this unity is a pan-Arab as 
well as a Yemeni responsibility. He emphasized that whatever 
the challenges and difficulties, our Yemeni people will maintain 
their unity in order to fulfill their aspirations for progress. 
  The Presidential Council chairman asked Col. Mustafa 
al-Kharrubi to convey an oral message to his brother Col. 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. He wished the fraternal Libyan people 
continued prosperity. 
  The meeting was attended by brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, 
Yemeni deputy prime minister; Ahmad Ba-al-Khayl, Libyan under 
secretary for foreign liaison and international cooperation; and 
brother Sartawi Yusuf, charge d'affaires of the Libyan 
brotherhood bureau in Sanaa.
