<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sultan al-Shu'aybi, assistant secretary </F>
general of the Yemeni Liberation Front Party, by Fathi al-Daw in 
Asmara--date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Daw] Let us start with the latest in the 
crisis, the document signed by the General People's Congress 
[GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. Do you think this 
document can end the crisis? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] In my opinion, documents are not important. 
What is important is the practical implementation of what was 
agreed or will be agreed. Once this happens, an objective 
solution can begin. But where do we stand vis-a-vis documents 
and treaties? It is well known that the unity agreement itself, 
according to which the merger took place, has not yet been 
implemented. This led to the crisis. 
  [Al-Daw] Do you mean past experience shows documents and 
agreements are not respected? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Not absolutely. I can be more specific and say 
between the YSP and the GPC. 
  [Al-Daw] You said practical implementation can lead to a 
solution. How can this document be activated to lead to the 
aspired solution? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] The matter simply lies in the credibility of 
the political leadership. Real credibility leads to the aspired 
solution. 
  [Al-Daw] During the crisis, several problems emerged once 
again, such as federation, confederation, and division. What is 
your opinion? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] First of all, we should admit that the Yemeni 
reality has transcended the partitioning process. Even the 
politicians have realized that unity is not a decision signed by 
leaders, because unity is rooted deep in Yemeni society, both 
north and south. Any careless decision to divide Yemen will 
certainly lead to a devastating civil war that might spill out 
of Yemen in to the entire region. Any other proposals should be 
presented to the masses in a popular referendum. In any case, 
temporary solutions lead nowhere and the crisis will continue to 
persist. 
  [Al-Daw] But the unity itself after more than three years 
now 
appears to be unity between two parties. Many issues are still 
unresolved. The unity has not embodied the people's feelings. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] I think unity within the framework of the 
Yemeni people is solid and firmly established. Even the past 
division was a political one between the authority in the north 
and the authority in the south. Both are primarily responsible 
for the consecration of division. Once there is a real national 
authority, unity will have great prospects. 
  [Al-Daw] Within the framework of unionist popular feelings, 
do you not believe that the cultural discrepancy between north 
and south has adversely affected the process of unity? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] I do not think so. The issue of unity is, 
north or south, not a subject of discussion among individuals. 
Even during the partition, the Yemeni citizen rejected division 
and said he was a Yemeni, and not a southern or northern Yemeni. 
  [Al-Daw] We have learned you sent a memorandum to President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih shortly before the signing of the latest 
document asking him to resign. Do you still insist on this? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Nothing has changed. The recent document and 
its implementation are put to the test and all he can do is 
resign. This may end the crisis. 
  [Al-Daw] What prompted you to make this appeal? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] As a politician observing the Yemeni situation 
after unity, which is over three years old now, I have not 
sensed any credibility in what he said or did. All he did was 
throwing dust in the eyes. Democracy continued to be blocked by 
his personal mood. It has not reflected on the Yemeni situation 
politically or economically, or even on the unity. 
  [Al-Daw] Accordingly, you consider the president the source 
of the crisis? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] If not so, he is largely blamed for it. The 
leadership should be able to overcome crises. Why is the Yemeni 
crisis continuing? I admit that there are good and active 
elements in the GPC, but they have been shackled by the 
leadership bureaucracy. They were not given the opportunity to 
do as much as they could. 
  [Al-Daw] Do you think Yemen is living a real democracy? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Very regrettably, no. 
  [Al-Daw] Then, how did you dare to present this memo? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] I have personally tasted the bitterness of 
political conflicts for about 29 years. I have been to prison 
and experienced the pains of displacement and deprivation. 
Nothing is left for me except speaking the truth, whether the 
rulers liked it or not. Nobody can question my patriotism. 
This is enough. 
  [Al-Daw] 'Ali Salim al-Bid said Sanaa became an arsenal of 
weapons. Do you believe this? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Certainly. This was one of the most important 
points in the YSP's memorandum. Sanaa has indeed become an 
arsenal of weapons. Al-Bid's description was right. Removing 
the manifestations of these arms from the capital and the other 
major cities is a pressing need. 
  [Al-Daw] Do you believe the GPC is behind this? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Generally speaking, no. This is because, as I 
said, there are good elements who are against these practices. 
However, there is a group of people who activate such matters. 
I wish the GPC was an organized and effective political party 
that keeps up with developments. Regrettably, however, the GPC 
is run by leaders whose only interest is scoring political 
points. 
  [Al-Daw] Financial corruption was one of the GPC's charges 
against the YSP. Do you share that opinion? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] It is quite the opposite. Financial and 
administrative corruption exists in former northern Yemen. I 
say so, despite our past differences with the brothers in 
southern Yemen, who used to have a Marxist orientation. The 
economic situation is a heavy burden for Yemen. Once security 
is achieved safety will be brought about. But I am afraid that 
as a result of the financial corruption, Yemen might turn into 
an Arab Nigeria or an Arab Brazil, so to speak. This is so 
because the wild beasts in power are primarily interested in 
looting the Yemeni people's resources. 
  [Al-Daw] Let us discuss the political violence that 
prevailed in Yemen in the wake of its unity. What is your 
explanation of all these practices? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] First of all, we are against political 
violence. Within the framework of the Liberation Front, we 
experienced much political violence in the past. We tasted its 
woes with the YSP, but we were not dragged behind this violence. 
When Yemeni unity was achieved, we supported this unity with 
our thought, views, and actions because this was our duty to 
perform. We also ignored grudges to champion the homeland's 
interest. I should say here that senior personalities and 
leaders support political violence. I believe the YSP has known 
claws, but it abandoned this policy and tried to follow a 
democratic way. Regrettably, however, the YSP has faced this 
kind of dirty conflict. 
  [Al-Daw] Does Yemen's tribal structure have any role in 
creating the conflict? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] I do not think so. As I said, some parties 
failed to deal with the political conflict through democratic 
dialogue, so they resorted to arms. Everyone wants to impose 
his viewpoint in his way. These parties failed to dispose of 
their old methods and could not comprehend the change that had 
taken place or keep pace with the times. 
  [Al-Daw] But how can individuals be disarmed? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] By awareness and by following the example of 
others. I recall that during the times of martyr al-Hamadi, 
people abandoned weapons because they followed al-Hamadi's 
example, so people regarded any violation as a shame. 
  [Al-Daw] What is the role of the Yemeni Jihad Movement in 
political violence? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] It has a great share, of course. It wants to 
impose its presence in Yemen by violence. Some people power 
promote this attitude. Naturally, if this support ceases, the 
movement will lose contact with its roots. 
  [Al-Daw] Is the Yemeni Reform Grouping, led by Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar, a facade for the Jihad Movement? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] This is partly true, despite the fact that 
there are good elements in the Reform Grouping. However, others 
aggravate matters to reach a critical point. The YSP mentioned 
this, and pinpointed the Jihad Movement's camps. The 
authorities should take a fully clear position on this issue. 
  [Al-Daw] Is there any foreign support for the Jihad 
Movement? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Of course. The fundamentalist movements that 
recently emerged in the Arab arena are linked with each other. 
I believe al-Turabi's movement in Sudan is the spearhead. 
Regrettably, this issue has not yet been discussed seriously in 
Yemen, either at the level of the leadership, the media, or 
other levels. 
  [Al-Daw] Do you believe that there is any future for the 
phenomenon of fundamentalism in Yemen? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Whether in Yemen or elsewhere, this is a 
transitional phenomenon that is the result of transitional 
circumstances. Yemenis are a Muslim people by nature. They do 
not accept acts of atonement or violence. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Daw] Can you shed light on the Liberation Front Party? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] This party has been a political organization 
since the days of armed struggle. It consisted of several 
groups, including the labor conference in Aden, which played a 
major role in the 26 September revolution. The party received a 
blow in 1967, so its leaders went abroad. Most of its leaders 
lived in the former northern Yemen and were not allowed to act. 
The leadership is still abroad since conditions for its return 
are not yet opportune. These leaders include Secretary General 
'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi and 'Abdallah al-Asnaj. We are now trying 
to reinstate the party. In September, we inaugurated a 
headquarters in Aden, in addition to the first one. However, and 
as you know, posts were given to persons who would serve the 
authorities. We are facing such difficulties. The party, 
however, exists, even within the framework of the GPC and the 
YSP; there is 'Ali Ahmad Salamah, who used to head the 
Liberation Front's Political Bureau. There is also 'Abdallah 
Mutlaq, and Balin Bin- Raji' Bin-Labbuzah [name as 
transliterated], who is the brother of the man who unleashed the 
October revolution, and many others. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Two Israeli emissaries returned home from Cairo 
after conferring there with PLO leaders, including Yasir 
'Arafat. They reported to the prime minister on the talks. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the two, the 
prime minister's political adviser Jacques Neriya, and Colonel 
'Amos Gil'ad, Mr. Rabin's deputy military secretary, left for 
Cairo this morning after consultations with the prime minister. 
They were instructed to find out 'Arafat's real stand on the 
possible resumption of the talks between Israel and the PLO. 
  The PLO's ambassador in Cairo said an Israeli envoy would 
arrive in Tunis within two days to hand 'Arafat Israel's 
response to the organization's demands on the security of the 
Palestinians in the territories. He said the PLO would decide 
whether to renew the peace talks based on Israel's answers. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 7 March 
reports that "Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation, 
told the PLO in Tunis that the Neriya-'Arafat meeting was 
positive, and that Neriya took notes, which he will deliver to 
Prime Minister Rabin this evening. Speaking to our 
correspondent, Sha'th said that it is still too early to speak 
of a summit meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin, but stressed that 
the contacts are positive, and that it is possible that 
developments will take place in several days, if Israel accepts 
the requests raised in Neriya's meeting with 'Arafat."]

  [Text] Political sources in Jerusalem say the conditions 
are not right yet for renewing negotiations with the PLO. At 
the same time, the sources told Qol Yisra'el's political affairs 
correspondent that Yasir 'Arafat's remarks in Cairo to senior 
Israeli officials leaves grounds for optimism. The contacts 
would enable further exchanges between the parties. Attending 
the meeting with 'Arafat in Cairo were Prime Minister Rabin's 
political adviser Jacques Neriya, his deputy military secretary, 
Lieutenant Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, and Israel's Ambassador David 
Sultan. Premier Rabin was briefed last night on the contacts 
and will today hold consultations on what transpired in Cairo. 
'Arafat has meanwhile returned to Tunis.

<F P=106> [Report by Pinhas 'Inbari, Pe'erli Shahar, Aharon Klein, and </F>
Natan Gutman in Washington] 
  [Excerpt] Diplomatic sources in Israel reported that 
international elements are trying to work out a four-point 
compromise permitting the resumption of the Washington talks: 
Israel will speed up the process of disarming the dangerous 
settlers; Israel will move "settlement points" in the heart of 
Arab towns -- Hebron, Nabulus, and Jericho, as well as Netzarim; 
the UN Relief and Works Agency will be strengthened and Israel 
will recognize its presence outside the refugee camps and its 
status as an observer, which it took on during the intifadah to 
Israel's dismay; and Israel will agree to release more 
Palestinian prisoners beyond the 1,000 already freed. 
  The sources said that if all the sides agree to this wording 
it will be possible to renew the talks in Washington in 10 days.

  [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] Israel's deputy foreign 
minister, Yosi Beilin, is on an official visit to Switzerland. 
He met with the state secretary in the Swiss Foreign Ministry, 
Jakob Kellenberger, for talks on issues ranging from the Middle 
East peace process to closer economic ties between the two 
countries. Mr. Kellenberger expressed concern about human 
rights in the occupied territories following the Hebron massacre 
last week in which a Jewish settler shot over 40 Muslim 
worshippers. At a press conference in Berne I asked Mr. Beilin 
how much of a threat the massacre poses to the Middle East peace 
talks. 
  [Begin recording] [Beilin] We hope and pray that it won't be 
a kind of a setback, and that all parties will understand that 
the best answer to the lunatics of this world is not to stop the 
process but to accelerate it, so that we will be able to 
conclude the negotiations about Gaza and Jericho and to go on to 
implement it as soon as possible. And once there is the change 
on the ground and once the Palestinians are having their own 
police forces and they are in charge of their own business, that 
will be the best answer to the extremists who would not like to 
see a peaceful solution for the Middle East. 
  [Correspondent] I wanted to know what measures Israel is 
going to take now to reassure the PLO and to get it back to the 
negotiating table. 
  [Beilin] Well, first of all I believe that the most 
important 
thing is to get back to the negotiating table. We took some 
measures but it is mainly for ourselves in order to do whatever 
possible to prevent the recurring of such an awful event. We 
are speaking about confiscating of the arms of some of the 
extremists in the West Bank, about restricting their moves [as 
heard], about the first time when there was a closure on a Jewry 
[as heard] settlement in the territories. We also released 500 
prisoners, Palestinian prisoners, and we are going to continue 
this process of releasing prisoners. But I believe that getting 
back to the negotiating table should not be a result of those 
steps or others, but a real interest of both parties. Because 
that is the best and only solution for the situation: Until now 
there were about 35 Israelis who have been killed by 
Palestinians since the signing of the agreement, there were more 
than 50 Palestinians killed in this massacre and later on. We 
have to put an end to this bloodshed and the only way to put an 
end to it is to sign the agreement between us and to implement 
it. The leaderships are ready, we have to educate both our 
peoples that there is no better option than that. 
  [Correspondent] How is Israel planning to ensure the 
security 
of the Palestinians in the occupied territories? 
  [Beilin] Well, first of all, I think that the most important 
thing is that they will have their own Palestinian police force, 
and they may have it if we sign the agreement, and we're 
speaking about weeks, not about months. It is a very important 
challenge for the Palestinians themselves -- I can understand 
the difficulty which is there -- but they have to take this 
challenge and to fulfil it. Of course there are Palestinians in 
other parts of the West Bank which will not be under the 
jurisdiction of the Gaza-Jericho council and we will have to do 
whatever possible in order not to expose them to dangers. I 
believe that those measures which were taken by the government 
and to which I referred to before, will help us in ensuring the 
security of the Palestinians. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any question of moving the settlers 
back to Israel? 
  [Beilin] No, we are not speaking about such a thing. We 
agreed with the Palestinians that the whole issue of the future 
of the settlements will be considered and debated towards the 
permanent solution and we agreed to (?reach) a permanent 
solution in five years from now, which means '99, and until then 
we will have to negotiate about the future of the borders, of 
the settlements. We cannot do such a thing in a very short 
while, and I think that we shouldn't. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] That was Israel's deputy foreign minister 
Yosi Beilin at a press conference in Bern.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Umberto De Giovannangeli in Jerusalem; date not given: "A Rapid 
Israeli Withdrawal -- Only in This Way Can We Save Peace" -- 
first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- "Despite all the current difficulties, 
I believe that the handshake between Rabin and 'Arafat 
represents a point of no return. We must get back to the 
negotiations table as soon as possible: because I am convinced 
that this time we will succeed in resolving all the issues that 
still remain open." Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin 
is certain of this. The hopes of peace in the Middle East have 
not faded. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion do the margins for a 
resumption in negotiations between Israel and the PLO exist for 
the immediate future as well as for an acceleration in the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Beilin] In the last sessions of negotiations with the PLO 
we 
dealt with practically all the fundamental issues relating to 
the implementation of the declaration of principles signed in 
Washington. We were on the point of closing this phase of 
talks. Then the Hebron massacre took place. Nevertheless, I am 
convinced that if we return to negotiate quickly, which I think 
is possible, we will succeed in speeding up the implementation 
of autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  [De Giovannangeli] At what point are diplomatic discussions 
on the possible deployment of international observers or a 
multinational military contingent in the occupied territories? 
  [Beilin] The problem has already been raised in Oslo and an 
accord with the PLO has been reached on an international 
presence in Gaza and Jericho during the transitory phase of 
autonomy. The Palestinians should understand the novelty and 
the importance of this "yes" by Israel, a fact that is without 
precedent in our history. 
  [De Giovannangeli] A civilian presence or even a military 
presence? 
  [Beilin] Civilian, only civilian. 
  [De Giovannangeli] The position of Syria is crucial in 
achieving overall peace in the Middle East. Can you tell us if 
something is moving in negotiations with Damascus, even if 
officially interrupted. 
  [Beilin] There is no doubt that Syria today still maintains 
a 
central role in the Middle East scenario: Peace with President 
al-Asad would mean really turning over a new leaf in this 
tormented region. But peace as defined by Syria is still a 
limited "armored" peace that is dictated more by necessity than 
by conviction. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Instead what kind of peace does Israel 
propose? 
  [Beilin] Total peace, without any restrictions on the 
economic, political, and diplomatic relations front. If Syria 
is willing to talk about peace in these terms, on our side we 
could easily open discussions on the schedule and the extent of 
our withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
  [De Giovannangeli] In these days, the usual proclamations of 
war seem to be accompanied by some signs of flexibility from the 
Palestinian refusal front, and even from the Hamas integralists. 
Do you think that these signs are credible? 
  [Beilin] Absolutely not. Hamas has gained consensus not 
because of the strength of his ideas but because of the poverty 
and the profound hardship that marks the life of Palestinians 
today, particularly in the Gaza Strip. For this I consider it 
crucial to accelerate the process of autonomy. I am convinced 
that when the economy of the territories becomes buoyant and 
when the Palestinian police force is formed, many will pass over 
to the side of the PLO. I believe that the effort of 'Arafat, 
also in view of the elections in Gaza and Jericho, will be to 
form a coalition among the moderate elements. At least this is 
what I hope. 
  [De Giovannangeli] Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or 
"uncertain" over the likelihood of a resumption in peace 
negotiations? 
  [Beilin] Despite everything, I am confident about the future 
of the negotiations. For a very simple reason: because I do 
not see any other path to follow. There is no alternative to 
dialogue. The choice of peaceful cohabitation, which lies at 
the basis of the Washington accords and which unites the 
majority of the Israelis and Palestinians remains irreversible, 
and no terrorist act can place this under discussion again. 
  [De Giovannangeli] The Jewish settlements in the 
territories, 
which the Palestinians are asking to be dismantled even in light 
of the Hebron massacre, are an obstacle on the road to peace 
today. 
  [Beilin] The Oslo accords postponed discussions on the 
settlements to the final phase of negotiations. And for us this 
still remains valid. It does not mean, however, that we will 
not act to stop the colonization and above all to suppress the 
terrorist acts of extremist groups. 
  [De Giovannangeli] But disarming the colonists and 
dismantling, even if this is gradual, the settlements are 
requests that have also been advanced by the Meretz ministers, 
to whom Rabin seems to want to respond by opening to the Tsomet 
of the right. 
  [Beilin] Personally, I hope that the Tsomet will not enter 
the government. However, even if this were to happen, the peace 
process will not be interrupted and neither will the decision to 
negotiate with the PLO under the terms sanctioned by the accord 
on Gaza and Jericho be questioned again.

from Yasir 'Arafat in which he expresses the hope that all the 
forces working for peace in Israel will participate in adopting 
practical measures to block the activities of the settlers, 
something that will make it possible to quickly implement the 
Declaration of Principles agreement. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that 'Arafat sent the 
letter in response to a cable from Knesset Member Katz in which 
he called on him to demonstrate leadership and overcome those 
who are trying to torpedo the peace process.

  [Text] The Labor bureau and caucus decided that the 
agreement with Meretz is binding and it is vital for the 
continuation of the peace talks that Meretz remain in the 
coalition. The participants also expressed support for the 
initiative to co-opt into the coalition any Knesset faction that 
accepts the government's basic guidelines and the agreement with 
the PLO. The prime minister told the meeting that in the wake 
of the Hebron massacre there is an atmosphere of pre-retaliation 
in the Arab world. The government must be prepared, and expand 
the coalition. 
  Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin attacked the prime minister 
saying that he does not call a spade a spade, and plays a game 
of saying yes and no at the same time. Beilin quoted from the 
Kahn Commission on the Sabra and Shatila massacre on what it had 
to say about Refa'el Eytan and asked how international public 
opinion and the Arabs could accept Eytan joining the government. 
Beilin was constantly interrupted by catcalls. 
  The Meretz Knesset faction unilaterally reaffirmed its 
opposition to Tzomet joining the government. The faction said 
that Meretz cannot be a member of a government in which Tzomet 
is a member under the present circumstances, and its ministers 
will resign the moment negotiations are opened between Labor and 
Tzomet. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir notes that during the 
meeting, Minister Shulamit Aloni apologized for her reported 
remarks in YEDI'OT AHARONOT that Sarid "is a spokesman and a 
public relations man" and said she had no intention of 
criticizing Yosi Sarid. She also made it clear that there is no 
basis for the reports that she opposes the faction's stand on 
Tzomet. Meretz decided to express full confidence in Minister 
Yosi Sarid and his contribution to the movement's position on 
Tzomet. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 7 March adds: 
"Tzomet sources told our correspondent that senior party members 
who spoke to Prime Minister Rabin over the phone during the past 
few hours understood that the Tzomet story is over, and that the 
main thing now is bringing SHAS (Torah Observing Sephardim) back 
into the government while reaching a compromise with Meretz. 
Tripartite Meretz-SHAS-Labor negotiations are currently under 
way." ] 
  Tzomet Chairman Refa'el Eytan informed his Knesset faction 
that he is waiting to hear from the prime minister, if he 
intends to invite Tzomet to negotiations on joining the 
coalition. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports Eytan as 
saying that if he is invited, he will go to the meeting. Nobody 
in the faction had reservations about that position. Eytan said 
he would present the prime minister with positions he has 
coordinated with Zvulun Hammer, the National Religious Party 
chairman.

  [Text] The state commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre will begin its work this morning. Today, the 
commission will interview 11 witnesses from the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces]. The first witness is Major General Dani Yatom, 
the commander of the Central Command. The military commander of 
the Cave of the Patriarchs will also appear before the 
commission. Our legal affairs correspondent Mira Amsalem 
reports: 
  The state commission of inquiry known as the Shamgar [named 
after Supreme Court justice heading it] commission will start 
its proceedings this morning by hearing the testimony of 
military personnel. The first witness will be Maj. Gen. Dani 
Yatom, the commander of the Central Command. The members of the 
commission -- Justice Me'ir Shamgar, the president of the 
Supreme Court; Justice El'iezer Goldberg, Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Zu'bi, Professor Menahem Ya'ari, and former Chief of Staff 
Moshe Levi -- will hear the testimony of and interrogate Maj. 
Gen. Yatom. Afterwards, apparently today, they will also hear 
the testimony of Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, the commander of 
IDF forces in Judaea and Samaria. The commander of the Cave of 
the Patriarchs will also be interrogated this week. As a rule, 
the commission will hold its proceedings four times a week, in 
the morning and in the afternoon. Due to the Ramadan fast, the 
Arab witnesses will only testify before the commission after the 
fast is over, in approximately two weeks. 
  This week, then, military, police, and Border Police 
personnel will give testimony. The witnesses will appear 
without legal counsel. If the commission decides that certain 
witnesses may be harmed by their testimony, they will be warned 
and subsequently permitted to employ legal representation. 
However, it may be safely assumed that some of the witnesses 
have already received, or will receive, private legal 
counselling before testifying to the commission. 
  The commission's letter of appointment stipulates that it 
will investigate findings and reach conclusions as to the facts 
and circumstances relating to the massacre. In its search for 
the truth, the commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre 
may reach the highest levels of the IDF, the Civil 
Administration, the Shin Bet, and even up to the defense 
minister. The commission has been given the results of the 
IDF's investigation into the massacre and additional material 
amassed by the attorneys responsible for collecting all relevant 
material, Miki Shaqed and Dafna Bienvoll. 
  The military investigation has already revealed flaws in 
security regulations at the Cave; however, this is only one 
aspect of the investigation. Beyond clarifying the facts, the 
commission must also present its findings as to the 
responsibility for the massacre. The commission will try to 
answer these most disturbing questions in the form of 
recommendations for future implementation and personal 
conclusions with regard to actions taken by specific parties in 
the past. Did the Shin Bet indeed issue an early warning? What 
was the nature of the activities of the members of the Kakh 
organization and the murderer Barukh Goldstein? What were the 
standard security regulations at the Cave of the Patriarchs and 
what were the instructions and regulations governing behavior at 
the site? Were the authorities adequately prepared for the 
Ramadan fast? And finally, who bears responsibility for all 
this? 
  The commission of inquiry has published notices in the 
newspapers calling on all witnesses to the massacre to come and 
testify. This is the 11th commission of inquiry established 
according to law. Four commissions in the past recommended the 
dismissal of senior officials. According to various 
assessments, it will take this commission at least two months to 
publish its recommendations.

  [Excerpts] Some 25,000 people demonstrated at Malkhey 
Yisra'el Square in Tel Aviv last night in solidarity with the 
massacre victims at the Patriarchs Cave. Demonstrators called 
on the government to evacuate Jews from Hebron, to take steps to 
renew the peace talks, and to lift the closure on the 
territories. The demonstration was organized by Peace Now and 
Arab local council leaders. [passage omitted] 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's adviser Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi says 
the 
evacuation of Jews from Hebron is a necessary first step to the 
renewal of peace talks. Al-Tibi was asked by our correspondent 
Dani Gur-Arye at the demonstration in Tel Aviv last night when 
the PLO will agree to return to the bargaining table: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tibi] I don't know, it depends on the 
decisions of the Government of Israel. The most and cardinal 
issue now is security for Palestinian civilians. It was proven 
that Palestinians are exposed to attacks by settlers, massacred, 
and this issue -- security for Palestinians -- should be 
immediately treated. Settlements and settlers should be disarmed 
and dismantled immediately, especially settlements inside the 
heart of the Palestinian population. This is a good message, a 
good signal from the people here in Israel, both Jews and Arabs, 
for the government of Israel, that it should do what she can do 
to immediately evacuate Jews from inside Hebron as a first step 
in order to improve the atmosphere for peace talks. 
  [Gur-Arye] You are talking about the dismantling of 
settlements, but that certainly isn't a precondition for the 
renewal of talks. 
  [Al-Tibi] The massacre created new conditions. Palestinians 
are exposed now for another massacre. Can anyone guarantee that 
the Palestinians could not be massacred again? Nobody. That's 
why we are asking for new guarantees for the Palestinian 
civilians. The Palestinian leadership is willing to continue 
the peace talks because it is committed for the peace process, 
but new circumstances had been created and a new measure should 
be done immediately. [end recording]

prepared to cooperate with their Israeli counterparts to set up 
joint ventures to serve the economies and tourist industries of

  [Text] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yegor Ivanov says 
all sides should return to the Middle East peace talks without 
preconditions. Ivanov met with Prime Minister Rabin this 
morning at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Dani Gur-Arye 
reports: 
  Prime Minister Rabin and Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov met 
for almost an hour in Tel Aviv. Later Ivanov, who recently met 
with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, told reporters most meetings 
centered on ways to renew the peace talks: 
  [Begin Ivanov recording; Ivanov speaks in Russian with 
superimposed translation into English] In this new situation 
none of the sides can set preconditions. The best solution is 
for all sides to return promptly to the talks. [end recording] 
  Ivanov was asked about criticism Rabin levelled recently at 
Russia over its attempt to mediate between the sides 
independently of the United States. 
  [Begin Ivanov recording] Russia and the United States are 
the 
co-sponsors of the Middle East process, and there are ground 
rules for cooperation. With that, each of the co-sponsors is 
free to take its own initiatives as long as the goal is to 
further the peace talks. [end recording] 
  Ivanov said he is convinced Russia can help bring the sides 
back together.

  [Text] As reported earlier in the bulletin, a press 
conference was held today on an official visit by a Latvian 
Government delegation to Israel. The head of the delegation, 
Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, briefly described it as follows: 
  [Begin Birkavs recording] The visit to Israel took place in 
a 
very complex situation regarding foreign and domestic policy, 
which has evolved in Israel after the Hebron tragedy when many 
dozens of people were killed in a sacred place. There were 
perhaps only small schedule changes during the visit; in general 
the visit proceeded according to schedule. I think that this is 
an indicator of Israel's especially favorable attitude and wish 
to maintain contacts with us on a wide scale. 
  As far as the main essence of the visit itself, in several 
words I would characterize it as a new leaf which has been 
turned over in our mutual relations, a leaf on which we made 
several significant inscriptions. These inscriptions are an 
agreement on cooperation in the spheres of education, culture 
and science, and on promotion and mutual protection of 
investment. 
  But all the talks which we held with the Israeli president, 
the Israeli prime minister, the Israeli foreign minister, and 
other ministers are practical evidence of the fact that we have 
very wide possibilities for mutual cooperation. And Israel, if 
the peace process develops successfully there, will be a country 
which will develop rapidly. And as we do not have a 
representation in that region, then the government's plan to 
open an embassy in Israel -- possible in the fall -- was 
received with great understanding and it will be a guarantee 
that our relations will widen. [end recording] 
  Mr. Birkavs also reported that during the visit, the Latvian 
Government delegation received from the Israeli Government an 
offer for arms sale. Representatives of the Latvian Government 
also visited a language teaching center in Israel, where they 
familiarized themselves with the system of teaching Hebrew. As 
Birkavs said, discussing problems of citizenship in Latvia, 
representatives of the Israeli Government stressed that the 
knowledge of the language should be put forward as the main 
criterion for granting citizenship. A visit by Israeli experts 
in power engineering and internal affairs to Latvia is also 
expected soon, as well as a visit by representatives of the 
Knesset, i.e. parliament.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Instigation and Incipient Betrayal"] </F>
  [Text] A group of ministers -- some say they represent a 
majority of Rabin's government -- has launched an inflammatory 
campaign against the Jewish settlers in the heart of Hebron and 
against dozens of Jewish settlements throughout Judaea, Samaria, 
and Gaza. They are demanding that the Jewish settlers be 
evacuated at once because their presence supposedly fans the 
flames of hatred between Jews and Arabs and hurts the peace 
process. 
  This unbridled incitement against the Jewish settlers, who 
are being portrayed as an obstacle to peace, totally contradicts 
the remarks the prime minister made as he signed the agreement 
with the PLO -- namely, that not a single settlement would be 
evacuated as a result of the implementation of that agreement. 
  We do not know how much power that ministerial group -- the 
group comprising the Meretz ministers and the left-wing sector 
of Labor -- wields, and we have as yet to hear the prime 
minister's reaction to the adverse counsel given by these 
ministers at such a time. 
  The public pronouncements of that group of ministers are not 
only uncomplimentary to the prime minister, but they also prove 
that Yitzhaq Rabin's position within his government has been 
seriously impaired. He no longer leads; others are trying to 
lead him toward steps that are utterly discordant with the 
Zionist doctrine and the political and security needs of the 
State of Israel. 
  The initiative of that group of ministers both harms the 
State of Israel and encourages the PLO and its cohorts to 
increase the pressure on the Israeli Government to disband the 
Jewish settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza and to deploy an 
armed international force in those areas to protect Arab 
residents whose lives are being threatened by Jewish 
"terrorists." 
  Not only is the conduct of these ministers unwise, it 
indicates an incipient betrayal of the special interests of the 
entire Israeli nation. 
  The Jewish settlements throughout Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, 
including the Jewish presence in the city of Hebron, were 
established on the basis of incontestable resolutions made by 
Israeli Governments which acknowledged the right of every single 
Jew to build his home in any part of Eretz Yisra'el. 
  Proposing the evacuation of Jewish settlements from Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza is tantamount to proposing a Jewish surrender 
to Arab terror or, perhaps, to offering the PLO the keys to an 
independent, 'Arafat-led Palestinian state in Judaea, Samaria, 
and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, on a 
silver platter. 
  Ministers doing the PLO's work have no place in the 
Government of Israel. If the prime minister lacks the power to 
curb them, he should disband the government and replace it with 
a government loyal to the people of Israel and to Eretz Yisra'el. 
  The people of Israel need a government capable of 
representing its political and security interests with national 
dignity. It is natural, therefore, that so many people are 
opposed to the left-wing government, whose acts are more than 
unwelcome, whose acts jeopardize the well-being and security of 
the State of Israel.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hebron Evacuation on the Agenda"] </F>
  [Text] In yesterday's cabinet meeting, many ministers 
proclaimed their support for the evacuation of the Hebron 
settlers, but a cabinet resolution, which is needed in principle 
as well as for tactical purposes, was never endorsed. The 
Likud, the NRP [National Religious Party], and Moledet are 
opposed to the evacuation. Moreover, the Tzomet faction, which 
the prime minister would like to include in the coalition, is 
"adamantly" opposed to it. There is a polarization of views 
even in Labor, where Ministers Shetrit and Tzur contest the 
issue with the doves of the Mashov circle. 
  Our political situation would have been less calamitous had 
the government removed the 42 settler families and the 150 
yeshiva students from their houses, which are located in the 
heart of the Arab city, right after the Cave of the Patriarchs 
massacre and settled them temporarily in Qiryat Arba'. 
  U.S. and UN representatives have informed the Arabs -- the 
Muslims and the PLO -- that they will not allow the Security 
Council to denounce Israel. The United States will not agree to 
anything other than a denunciation of the massacre itself. 
Furthermore, it is not looking forward to sending UN troops to 
territories administered by Israel. It will be another week 
before we know for certain whether the United States is a 
consistent champion of the stand taken by Israel, which agreed 
to a temporary international or outside presence "to be agreed 
on" in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area only. 
  Since the crime was committed outside Gaza and Jericho, the 
argument that the United States should "protect the safety of 
the Palestinians" -- namely, everybody -- carries some weight. 
The removal of Jews from Hebron will not satisfy all the 
anti-Israel demands, which have been aired by exploiting the 
Security Council as a platform, but it can attenuate their 
magnitude. 
  Beyond the problem that has arisen in the UN arena, the 
permanent Jewish presence in Hebron hampers the PLO's 
performance in the peace process. Yasir 'Arafat was willing to 
come to Washington in response to President Clinton's 
invitation, but he was unable to act on his wishes, and the 
peace process was discontinued as a result of the majority 
opinion in the PLO-Tunis directorate. If the Israeli Government 
wants the PLO leader to be able to impose his authority on his 
organization and on the Palestinian population in the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip, it should make a move of its own. 
  Knesset Member [MK] Eliyahu Ben-Elisar has warned against 
evacuating the Hebron settlers because it might constitute a 
precedent for the removal of all the settlements; MK Rehav'am 
Ze'evi sees the evacuation of Hebron as "the first step toward 
the annihilation of the Zionist endeavor"; and one settler 
described the renewed Jewish settlement in Hebron as "the 
rectifying of old wrongs against the Jews." 
  They should all be told that Israel did not engage in the 
Six-Day War in order to take land; the victory should not have 
been used to annul our historical consent to the partition of 
the country in 1947. Settling accounts with the Hebron Arabs of 
1968 for the crimes their fathers committed in 1929 was a 
mistake to begin with, and it is certainly a mistake to 
perpetuate in 1994 an error made 26 years earlier. 
  Israel does not need a permanent Jewish presence in Hebron 
for security or any other reason; all it does is cause severe 
damage. The glory of the Jewish people's spiritual heritage does 
not lie in the presence of a handful of Jewish families in a few 
houses owned by Jews in the distant past. The IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] has tasks other than maintaining a vast 
deployment to protect that handful and stop it from provoking 
the Arab residents of the city.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Schiff: "On the Path to Conflict"] </F>
  [Text] The confrontation, or perhaps even battle, with the 
settlers in Hebron is only a question of time. It will either 
come now or in another few months. The question is whether the 
Government of Israel will decide right away, on the basis of the 
security situation in the town, to issue an evacuation order 
against the Jewish inhabitants. 
  The other possible date for a confrontation is in the 
summer, 
as July approaches. According to the Declaration of Principles 
[DOP], a significant change must take place in the city in 
another few months. It will be recalled that according to the 
agreement, the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will redeploy no 
later than on the eve of the elections to the authority (the 
elections are to take place nine months after the DOP goes into 
effect). The accord says that "in deploying its military 
forces, Israel will be guided by the principle that its military 
forces should be redeployed outside populated areas." 
  This means that IDF brigades will no longer be deployed in 
the center of Hebron, just as IDF units will not be able to move 
around the centers of Nabulus and Gaza, unless our aim is not to 
implement the accord with the Palestinians. Under the current 
security situation, there will be no choice but to offer the 
Hebron settlers the opportunity to move to Qiryat Arba'. If any 
of the Jewish settlers in Hebron believe that following the 
massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs and the frequent 
humiliation they cause their neighbors, their security will come 
from the Palestinian police, they are being overly optimistic. 
Israeli security experts do not share that view. 
  The reason for the evacuation is therefore one of security 
rather than politics. When the ministers argue about the Jewish 
presence in Hebron, most of them base the need to evacuate on 
security reasons. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin 
Ben-Eli'ezer, who was coordinator of activities in the 
territories and the military commander of the West Bank, heads 
the proposal for the evacuation of Hebron and bases it on the 
need to defend the Jewish residents and not to please the 
Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre. The ministers 
who heard the reports by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq and Major 
General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central Command, got the 
impression that they are also worried about the security aspect. 
The Jews of Hebron have become a target, one of them said. 
Immediately after the massacre, another security official 
proposed to evacuate Hebron and Qiryat Arba', even temporarily. 
He was concerned about the women and children. Everybody 
listened, but his proposal was not discussed at that stage. 
  From a military viewpoint, we have reached an absurd 
situation in Hebron. No precedent for the number of soldiers 
required to defend the Hebron settlers can be found in the 
history of border incidents or the defense of any other 
settlement. The ministers were shocked by the figures quoted by 
the chief of staff. Although we are in the midst of peace 
negotiations, the defense of the Hebron settlers is more like 
war deployment. There are times when numbers are not what 
counts -- for instance, if there were a need to defend 
Jerusalem. But that is not the case with Hebron, especially 
since Qiryat Arba' is not far away. A top IDF commander must 
tell the Hebron settlers candidly that it is very difficult to 
provide them with the security they expect. If that situation 
continues, it will not be enough to deploy in the town even a 
large part of the soldiers serving in the entire West Bank, and 
there might even be a need to expel Arabs from Hebron. 
  The forecast of Avraham Ahituv, who was Shin Bet chief in 
the 
late 1970's and before that headed its Arab Department, is being 
realized. In the 1970's, some of the settlers began to 
infiltrate into Arab Hebron without permission. Some took 
unbridled actions even back then. Until that time, the 
situation between the two populations had been relatively calm. 
Ahituv came to Prime Minister Menahem Begin and told him that 
he was worried about "the infiltration into Hebron." He told 
Begin that we had arrived at a modus vivendi in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs and that there were good foundations for coexistence, 
but that the infiltration into Hebron might cause problems, for 
the security forces as well. He told Begin that this is what 
will hurt his party's basic tenet that Jews and Arabs can live 
together in peace under Israeli rule in Eretz Yisra'el. The 
entry into Hebron will only increase the friction and hatred, 
and clashes will become unavoidable. 
  I dare to guess that if Rabin were told that the Hebron 
settlers would leave now of their own free will, he would 
welcome it. He is not pleased that the proposal was raised by 
ministers, because this may hurt the negotiations. At least two 
ministers are ready to discuss evacuating the settlers from 
Hebron within the framework of the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. At least another eight ministers are prepared to 
support an Israeli-initiated evacuation. 
  The Americans view it from a different angle. They are 
concerned about 'Arafat's growing weakness, the risk to the 
peace negotiations, and the inadequate steps Israel took 
following the massacre. In their view, Israel must immediately 
make a unilateral move to put the talks back on track. The 
evacuation of Hebron for security reasons would be such an 
example, and their representatives are showing interest in it. 
Rabin will definitely be asked about it during his visit to 
Washington. 
  But even the Americans, like the Palestinians, understand 
that you cannot ask Refa'el Eytan to join the coalition and, 
with the same breath, order the evacuation of the Jewish 
settlers from Hebron.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "Five Comments on the </F>
Situation"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Is Only Their Blood Sacred? </H5>
  A single individual committed a massacre, and an entire 
country went down on its knees asking for forgiveness. One 
person committed a horrendous crime, and each one of us feels 
the blood on his hands. When it comes to pogroms, we -- the 
experienced victims -- know all there is to know about them. 
When the government asks for the forgiveness of the families, 
the Palestinian nation, and the whole world, it really 
represents every Israeli citizen. We, however, do not make do 
with a stately, official apology and a willingness to compensate 
the victims' families. Public figures -- the chief rabbi, the 
president of the state, cabinet ministers, delegations, party 
representatives -- extended their condolences in person. It 
seems to me that this has gone as far as to be groveling. 
Although only one person committed the act, and although the 
situation could have been reversed, it is good that the 
Israelis, as individuals and as a collective, feel the need to 
apologize. 
  So what is bothering me? I am disturbed by the fact that in 
the dozens of years in which Arabs have been slaughtering 
innocent Jews -- the Shafrir children (1956), the children of 
Avivim, the Munich athletes, the Coastal Road victims, the 
worshipers at the Istanbul and Paris synagogues, the passengers 
of planes and buses; all those innocent old men, women, and 
children who were shot, stabbed, slaughtered, and blown up in 
their homes, in market places, and while walking down a street 
-- not a single Arab has asked for our forgiveness. How could 
it be that through all those years there was not a single Arab 
on the other side -- leader, professor, spiritual leader, Arab 
"Peace Now" activist -- who expressed remorse for the murder of 
innocent Jews? Is their blood more sacred than ours? 
<H5>  2. Waiting for Slaughter </H5>
  Our asking for forgiveness may be good for our conscience 
and 
our international image, but I doubt that it will in any way 
change the Arabs' deep feeling of hatred for Jews. 
  What transpired in the Israeli Arab sector will be dwarfed 
by 
the events that will take place when the closures and curfews 
imposed on the territories are lifted. Brace yourselves for 
bloody riots and a series of acts of revenge. We live in a part 
of the world where blood vengeance is the way to settle 
accounts. We must be prepared for a series of attacks against 
Jews. It is no accident that the authors of the Oslo agreement 
walk around with ashen faces these days. Suddenly it has become 
apparent that the conflict is twofold: political and religious. 
  While we are handling the political aspect of the conflict, 
the abyss between the fanatics of both religions is widening. 
Arab statesmen are willing to recognize the existence of 
Israel. The problem is that the Muslim movements recognize 
neither Israel nor the Arab statesmen who do. Perhaps a major 
act of revenge -- something like a massacre in a synagogue -- 
will allow the resumption of the talks. Nevertheless, as long 
as the Islamic movement on the other side and the religious 
zealots on our side set the tone, peace will never come anywhere 
near being a profitable enterprise. 
<H5>  3. Is Yafo Burning? </H5>
  The U.S. State Department travel advisory recommending that 
U.S. citizens refrain from entering Nazareth and Yafo is 
surprising and annoying. I suggest that the U.S. Administration 
start showing concern for the wellbeing of Americans in 
Washington D.C., New York, and Detroit -- the main centers of 
violence in the United States -- before it fans the flames here 
and kills our tourism season. Yafo is not burning yet, but what 
took place among the Arab residents there is a time bomb. I 
must admit that I did not know they hate us that much there, 
that so much hatred has accumulated there. 
  No one had expected the Israeli Arabs to be Zionists. It is 
only natural that they stage demonstration in sympathy for their 
brethren across the Green Line. But the fact that they smashed 
windows of Jewish shops, overturned and burned cars, threw rocks 
at the police, hoisted Palestinian flags, and chanted PLO 
slogans and songs of revenge against Jews -- and not just one 
day, but for four consecutive days -- calls for the following 
question: Do these Israeli citizens regard themselves part of 
the future Palestinian entity? One could even consider 
exchanging populations: bring in the settlers, and allow the 
Israeli Arabs join their brothers in the territories. After 
all, the idea of driving to Yafo for a seafood dinner only to 
find that your car has been gutted is not very appealing in the 
long run. It is enough that we are on the verge of a state-wide 
civil war; we do not need war between residents of central 
Israel in the heart of Tel Aviv. 

<H5>    4. And Now, a Defense Minister </H5>
  Yitzhaq Rabin -- prime minister, health minister, religious 
affairs minister, and interior minister -- is yet to regret that 
he also held on to the defense portfolio. The commission of 
inquiry, headed by Me'ir Shamgar, will most probably work along 
the lines of the letter of appointment it was issued. Coming 
from a security background of 20 years of Army service, Shamgar 
will most probably stay within the restricted limits he was 
given. He may stop at the sentry, the major, or the brigade 
commander. Such commissions of inquiry, however, have a 
vitality of their own, even after they end their work and 
disband. Such commissions may stop at a certain point, but the 
conclusions they reach keep growing branches and treetops. The 
Agranat Commission [which investigated the Yom Kippur War] 
stopped with the chief of staff, but after the commission broke 
up, the public ruled that the defense minister and the prime 
minister were to blame. 
  Even if the current commission does not go as far as the 
defense minister, we will not be surprised if he finds himself 
in the shadow of his ministerial responsibility. Also, the 
stages of the arrangement with the Palestinians will be very 
complex because of the security arrangements, and so closely 
linked with clashes with the Jewish settlers and Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], that we will not only need a full-time 
prime minister; we will also need a full-time defense minister. 
Rabin had better part with the role he loves so much, and 
appoint a defense minister at this time to cut the link between 
the moves called for now and the Shamgar commission conclusions. 
<H5>  5. Home Alone </H5>
  Stopping the talks was an idiotic move by Yasir 'Arafat. 
Perhaps he wants to calm spirits in the territories, and 
perhaps he is waiting for a "counter massacre" which will allow 
him to return to the talks on a seemingly equal basis. Luckily 
for him, Rabin believes that when terror acts take place, the 
dialogue process must be accelerated because if we stop the 
talks after every painful attack, we will get nowhere. 
  I hope 'Arafat is not serious in his demand that the 
Document 
of Principles be reopened; or in his call for an international 
force to be stationed in the territories; or in his demand that 
we agree to begin discussing the uprooting of the settlements 
and disarming the settlers as a precondition for his returning 
to the talks. Rabin does not accept any of the changes -- not 
because he does not want to, but because he cannot do this with 
the minority-based government he is heading. 
  'Arafat is also wrong in expecting a deeper U.S. involvement 
in the political process. The days of the Nixon-Kissinger, 
Carter-Vance, Reagan-Shultz, Bush-Baker point-by-point 
involvement are gone. Clinton only cares for the United States 
and so far, the administration has shown no desire to step in 
with both its feet into our swamp. There seems to be no strong 
secretary of state in sight who could push us to deal with our 
affairs. 'Arafat has no alternative: He and Rabin were left 
home alone.

<F P=106> [Commentary by 'Aqiva Eldar: "Turn the Pyramid Upside Down"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- Since the signing ceremony at the 
White House, Israeli and U.S. politicians have tried to paint 
this temporary and partial agreement in peace colors. This 
would not have been so bad had they not started believing that 
the negotiations on limited autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would 
bring the Middle East into a new era. Instead of reading the 
writing on the wall, they preferred to become immersed in 
daydreams about the end of days. 
  It is characteristic that in the week of the Cave of the 
Patriarch murders, Jordanian diplomats found it hard to wriggle 
out of the Israeli and U.S. bear hug. A member of the Jordanian 
cabinet was invited to Washington to give the date of the Amman 
conference that is supposed to bring together thousands of 
company directors. A different delegation searched for escape 
routes from the trilateral forum which emerged at the 
Clinton-Hasan-Peres meeting at the White House. Soon, economic 
and environmental experts will drag themselves to Oman or Qatar, 
or perhaps Tunis, for another round of multilaterals. Morocco 
did not know how to get out of the desertification conference 
initiated by Peres and Vice President Al Gore. It can be 
assumed that Goldstein solved the problem for them. 
  Since 13 September, U.S. Administration spokesmen have been 
reiterating the three targets they have taken upon themselves. 
First: advancement toward a comprehensive peace, or in other 
words, bridging the gaps between Israel and Syria. Second, 
recruiting the international community to rehabilitate the 
inhabitants of the territories so that the Palestinians believe 
that peace pays. Third, improving relations between the Arab 
states and Israel, mainly through efforts to lift the Arab 
boycott so that Israelis find that peace pays. Next week will 
be six months since the signing ceremony at the White House. 
What is left? Syria and Israel are more or less treading 
water. The Clinton-al-Asad summit meeting was wasted, and the 
Palestinians learned that it is much easier to exploit people 
under occupation than to rehabilitate them. 
  The most striking achievement of U.S. diplomacy since the 
Madrid conference was the public relations campaign for the 
Declaration of Principles among the Jews, especially in America. 
Several minor Arab leaders who understood that Clinton would owe 
them a favor, made the Israelis several small gestures. The 
Americans, with their faulty understanding of inter-Arab 
politics, continued to exert pressure. They wanted the Arabs to 
lift the embargo even before the first Israeli soldier leaves 
Gaza, and pleaded with al-Asad to shake hands with Yitzhaq 
Rabin, although the latter tied himself to the Golan Heights 
through a referendum. President Clinton is urging King Husayn to 
accept Israeli leaders in Amman before a single uprooted family 
is returned to Ramallah and while Kahanists imported from 
America run around in Hebron as if they own the place. 
  It appears that the Americans recently became concerned that 
the Hebron massacre might spoil their relations with the Jews. 
The President and the secretary of state apologize almost every 
time somebody forces them to say that it would be preferable 
that armed Goldsteins not roam around in Hebron. While this 
article is being written, three announcements came up on my 
facsimile machine: One announced Vice President Gore's 
participation in a fundraising dinner for Bar Ilan University at 
the Israeli Embassy in Washington. In a special gesture, on the 
day after the massacre, Gore announced that he had decided to 
accept an old invitation to receive an honorary doctorate from 
the National Religious Party's intellectual bastion. 
Immediately after that, came another White House announcement: 
The entire telephone conversation between Clinton and the 
family of the yeshiva student wounded in Brooklyn. And after 
that, more good news: The federal official in charge of U.S. 
heritage abroad announced that Ukranian President Leonid 
Kravchuk took time off in Washington to sign an agreement to 
look after the synagogues and Jewish cemeteries in his country. 
  On the other hand, leaders of the Arab lobby in the United 
States who have repeatedly requested a meeting with the 
President since the massacre, have so far been turned down. A 
group of Arab activists in the "Builders for Peace" movement, 
another level in the upside down pyramid of the peace process, 
had to settle for a meeting with the vice president. It was 
reported that he was "pleasantly surprised with their good 
manners." 
  The signs of friendship are touching, but the problem of the 
moment is the difficulty of building a peace process credible to 
both sides on such a transparent leaning toward Israel by the 
sole mediator.

  [Text] Tehran, March 8, IRNA -- A morning English daily 
here Tuesday commented on the recent remarks by U.S. officials 
on Washington's intentions to open direct talks with Iran. 
  "Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the 
legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding 
international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the 
political realities of the Islamic Republic," said `TEHRAN 
TIMES'. 
  It added that Washington's apparent change of heart is due 
to 
two major causes -- the limitation of the U.S. influence in the 
Middle East resulted from the region's cordial relations with 
Iran and failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace talks 
which makes Washington to use Tehran's "spiritual influence" in 
the Islamic world to revive and legitimize the peace accord. 
  "Iran has endeavored to stay faithful to its own Islamic 
revolution while leaving open the possibility of reconciliation 
with the U.S. provided that America releases Iran's assets and 
refrains from covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and 
destabilizing the Islamic Republic." 
  In the case of re-establishment of ties with Iran, the U.S. 
would stand to gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should 
be prepared to make greater concessions, said the daily in 
conclusion noting that Iranian officials are well aware of this 
fact and would base their demands accordingly.

  [Text] Tehran, March 8 (AFP)--A normalisation of US-Iranian 
relations will only be achieved if the United States makes major 
concessions including the release of Iranian frozen assets, a 
semi-official newspaper warned Tuesday [8 March]. 
  The English-language daily TEHRAN TIMES argued: "If 
relations 
are indeed re-established, the US stands to gain a lot more than 
Iran, therefore it should be prepared to make greater 
concessions." 
  Iran and the United States have not had diplomatic ties 
since 
1980, one year after the Islamic revolution which toppled the 
pro-American shah, whose regime was a major US ally in the 
Middle East. 
  But last week President Bill Clinton's adviser Anthony Lake, 
and Under Secretary of State for the Middle East Robert 
Pelletreau reported that Washington was ready to start talks 
with Iran. 
  The Iranian Government has so far not reacted officially to 
the US statements, but has indirectly welcomed the moves via 
favourable press reports, while restating its conditions for 
opening Iran-US talks. 
  The TEHRAN TIMES said: "Iran has left open the possibility 
of 
reconciliation with the US provided that America releases Iran's 
assets which are frozen in American banks and refrains from 
covert and overt operations aimed at destabilizing the Islamic 
Republic." 
  Iranian officials estimate more than 10 billion dollars are 
currently frozen in the United States. 
  The daily said the United States "is finally trying to come 
to terms with the political realities of the Islamic Republic, 
after 14 years of efforts to undermine its legitimacy." 
  It attributed the recent US gesture to a refusal by European 
countries to take part in the US bid to isolate Tehran, and also 
to the "failure of the US imposed Middle East peace talks." 
  This has prompted "Washington to consider using Tehran's 
spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive the peace 
accord," the TEHRAN TIMES added. 
  Last week the KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL, a daily close to Islamic 
hardliners traditionally opposed to the United States, spoke in 
favor of "a negotiated solution" to "bring an end to the 
hostility" between the countries.

  [Text] On 6 March Yasir 'Arafat, leader of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, arrived in Cairo to discuss the latest 
developments regarding the Hebron massacre as well as the 
situation in the occupied land with the head of the Egyptian 
regime Husni Mubarak. 
  The 'Arafat-Mubarak talks are taking place under 
circumstances when the head of the Egyptian regime, in contacts 
in the past few days with American and Israeli officials, has 
endeavored to reduce the current crisis in the Arab-Israeli 
dispute following the onslaught against worshipers in Hebron. 
The PLO has also dispatched envoys to Washington. The PLO has 
subjected the resumption of peace talks with Israel to the 
presence of international force in the occupied areas to protect 
the lives of Palestinians, to disarm the Jews in the region and 
to destroy some of the Jewish populated townships in Gaza and 
West Bank of Jordan river. The Zionist regime, meanwhile, has 
rejected as a precondition the presence of international force 
in the occupied lands to secure safety for Palestinians. 
Yitzhak Rabin has agreed to hold talks about presence of these 
forces in the occupied areas in the next round provided they are 
not military forces. To this end, yesterday, Norway said that 
it would dispatch forces to the usurped lands within an 
international force. 
  Political experts believe the presence of an international 
force in the occupied lands cannot serve favorable to the 
Zionist regime in light of the fact that the issue of Palestine 
and Israel will spread from the region to a vaster level and the 
Zionist regime will not welcome its consequences. However, it 
seems that in view of the pressure Israel feels at the moment 
from the public opinion, the plan on dispatch of international 
force to the occupied areas is brought about and pursued this 
time by the West and America with objectives in an entity which 
contradicts the ideals of Palestinians, and aims to reduce 
pressures exerted on Israel. Therefore, in the light of 
reflection of the Hebron massacre and the sensitive public 
opinion towards the crime, the Zionist regime has been placed in 
defensive position; and what is tangible in the midst is the 
efforts the West and America make to rid the Zionists of the 
current unfavorable situation. These efforts, once again, 
indicate the dual policy of the United States vis-a-vis the 
issues related to Israel and Arabs.

  [Text] Tehran, March 5 (AFP)--Iranian President 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
pledged here Saturday to work together to ward off foreign 
influence in Central Asia and the Middle East. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, in a meeting with Qian, urged Iran and 
China to play a "more active" international role in order to 
ward off "interference" by Western powers. 
  "Such a goal requires planning, cooperation, and further 
exchanges of views between the regional countries, particularly 
Iran and China," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said, according to his 
office. 
  The president urged Asian countries not to allow 
"domineering 
powers" to gain influence in Central Asian states and other 
regional countries in the "guise of solving their problems." 
  The ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia are Tajikistan, 
Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan. 
  Qian, who arrived here Friday at the head of a political and 
economic delegation, said cooperation between Tehran and Beijing 
had accelerated after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran 
"because of their common political views." 
  He agreed on the "need to resist" the influence of foreign 
powers in the region, a reason for which China was "determined 
to strengthen cooperation with countries like Iran," according 
to Hashemi-Rafsanjani's office. 
  Qian stressed the "need to ensure peace and stability in 
Central Asia to pave the way for economic progress" in the 
former Soviet republics. 
  "China supports economic prosperity in these countries and 
desires closer cooperation with Iran to solve regional crisis," 
he said. 
  Qian, who is here on the last leg of a tour of five Asian 
and 
Middle Eastern countries, is to leave for home Sunday. 
  An Iranian newspaper said Saturday that Tehran could serve 
as 
"Asia's Geneva" in solving the regional conflicts and urged 
major Asian countries, such as China and India, to support the 
idea. 
  "Tehran, a city synonymous with peace, possesses the 
necessary qualities and the good will to realise the idea," the 
English-language TEHRAN TIMES said. 
  Qian also held talks with his counterpart 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati 
and was to meet later with parliamentary speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri. 
  The two countries were also expected to discuss expansion of 
trade and economic cooperation and settling Iran's 100 million 
dollars in overdue debt to China. 
  Bilateral trade stands at around 700 million dollars, with 
China exporting 300 million dollars, mainly in machinery, and 
importing 400 million dollars, mostly in oil and steel. 
  Tehran and Beijing could discuss Chinese participation in 
several projects here, including the completion of the Tehran 
subway and construction of several cement plants and dams 
throughout Iran. 
  Newspapers said here in November that Tehran and Beijing had 
agreed to undertake a 60-million dollar project for building a 
copper foundry in southeastern Iran. 
  Iran and China are to launch a wide range of agricultural 
cooperation projects including sending Chinese experts to help 
in raising bees, fish and shrimp, according to Chinese sources.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzbeh Bu ol-Hari: "The PRC-Iran-India Axis </F>
To Counteract U.S. Policies"] 
  [Text] PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen will arrive in Iran 
after his Asian trip. His visit to Iran is within the framework 
of the regular visits carried out by the officials of the two 
countries to consolidate and broaden bilateral relations. 
Tehran and Beijing have particular reasons for expanding 
bilateral relations: 
<H5>  Broadening Economic Relations and Cooperation </H5>
  Qichen's remarks on political cooperation in safeguarding 
the 
interests of the countries of the south in the regional and 
international organizations have been assessed as positive and 
he has expressed his interest in closer cooperation among the 
PRC, India, and Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] member 
countries. 
<H5>  Interest in Preserving Peace and Stability in Central Asia </H5>
  The necessary coordination on issues pertaining to human 
rights is required, as the countries of the north are seeking to 
bestow legitimacy on their own overbearing viewpoint in this 
regard to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries of 
the south that oppose their domination. 
  It is predicted that the officials of the PRC and Iran will 
discuss these as well as other issues, such as the crisis in the 
Korean peninsula, the security of the Persian Gulf, and the 
Palestinian issue. 
  But most importantly, the talks between the PRC and Tehran 
will pertain to Washington's goals on the Asian continent. When 
the world is witnessing the rise of nationalism following the 
Cold War, the countries of the north spearheaded by the United 
States are seeking to capitalize on this phenomenon. In other 
words, the north is seeking to use the weapon of nationalism to 
break up that group of countries in the south that resists them. 
  The United States sees the extensive region from the Red Sea 
to Sinkiang and Tibet as suitable for the implementation of its 
objectives, which include some important countries in the region 
such as the PRC, India, Iran, and others. 
  In this regard, by supporting the secessionist movements, as 
in Tibet, the United States wants to create a security 
organization in Central Asia that will fill the vacuum stemming 
from its presence in that vast area. [as published] This is why 
we saw General Waters, the commander of the NATO armed forces, 
declaring that this organization is seeking to control countries 
such as Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Similarly it 
was announced that the United States is seeking to set up a base 
in Kyrgyzstan. 
  By capitalizing on the economic problems of the Central 
Asian 
countries, the United States wants to infiltrate the region. 
What is important in this path is that the national security of 
the PRC, Iran, and India will be endangered, because they are 
near this region. 
  If the U.S. goals in the breakup of the regional countries 
materialize, the front of the countries of the south and the 
Asian continent will face tension and instability. 
  But solidarity and coordination among Beijing, New Delhi, 
and 
Tehran could counteract this imperialistic policy of the 
countries of the north and prevent Central Asian countries from 
depending on them, thus guiding the region toward peace and 
stability. 
  The visit by Qian Qichen can help achieve this prospect.

  [Text] In a meeting today between Foreign Minister Velayati 
and the Russian deputy foreign minister, Anatoliy Adamishin, 
expansion of Iran-Russia ties, regional cooperation, and the 
resolution of regional crises, especially the Tajik crisis, were 
discussed. 
  At the meeting, Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Adamishin, 
said: Russia seeks to use its good relations with Iran to 
resolve regional crises, including the Tajik crisis, because we 
do not see any need for a military solution in Tajikistan. 
Therefore Iran and Russia are able, through using their 
influence, to establish peace and tranquillity in the region. 
He added: Iran and Russia have strategic interests in 
Tajikistan. 
  Mr. Velayati, while describing today's meeting of the Tajik 
opposition leaders and Russian officials in Tehran as important, 
considered it to be a turning point in resolving the Tajik 
crisis and said: The Islamic Republic of Iran supports any 
solution which will maintain the national interests of the Tajik 
people. 
  He added: The resolution of the Tajik crisis through 
military 
means is impossible. Therefore the only way to establish a fair 
and honorable peace is by peaceful means. 
  At the meeting, the issue of increasing regional cooperation 
-- especially the Organization for the Cooperation of the 
Caspian Sea Littoral States -- was discussed and the Russian 
deputy foreign minister declared his country's readiness for the 
earliest possible convening of a meeting of the Organization's 
senior experts.

  [Text] Tehran, March, 6, IRNA -- Iran and Russia here 
Saturday agreed to cooperate for peaceful settlement of current 
disputes in the Republic of Tajikistan. The agreement was 
reached by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi and his 
Russian counterpart Anatoliy Adamishin, currently here to 
discuss regional and bilateral issues with Iranian officials. 
  Adamishin, who arrived here last Friday, said that there was 
proper grounds for Tehran-Moscow cooperation to resolve 
Tajikistan disputes. Referring to the endeavors made by the 
Islamic Republic to bring an end to the disputes, Va'ezi 
reiterated that Iran, like before, would continue efforts to 
establish a just peace in Tajikistan. 
  Any effort should be based on existing realities inside 
Tajikistan and be aimed at resolving people's problems, Va'ezi 
added, stressing that the best way to this end was formation of 
a government able to materialize national aspirations of the 
Tajik people. 
  Adamishin is also expected to hold official talks with Tajik 
government's opposition leaders.

  [Text] During a meeting in Tehran today with Mr. Mahmud 
Va'ezi, Euro-American affairs deputy of the Foreign Ministry, 
the Russian deputy foreign minister, Anatoliy Adamishin, spoke 
about the possibility of meeting officially the leaders of the 
opponents of the Tajik Government in Tehran. 
  Stressing the importance of resolving the problems of 
Tajikistan by peaceful means, he pointed out: We admit that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran has deep historical and religious links 
with the people of Tajikistan, and we consider this a good basis 
for cooperation with Iran to resolve the Tajikistan conflict. 
  According to a report of the Central News Unit, Mr. Va'ezi 
said at this meeting: Iran will continue to strive as it has in 
the past to restore peace in Tajikistan. He added: Any efforts 
to resolve the Tajikistan problem should focus on realities and 
should attempt to solve the people's difficulty. These efforts 
should also focus on the establishment of a comprehensive 
government that can meet the national objectives of the people 
of Tajikistan, which seems to be the best alternative.

  [Text] Within the framework of national reconciliation plan 
in Tajikistan, the first round of talks between the leaders of 
Tajikistan's Islamic and national groups opposed to the present 
government in Tajikistan and the first deputy foreign minister 
of Russia, Anatoliy Adamishin, began in Tehran today. 
  During these talks the leaders of the opposition groups 
explained their views on ways of restoring tranquillity and 
security in that country and stressed the need for establishment 
of democracy by involving all the forces of Tajikistan in 
running the country's affairs. 
  These talks are taking place with approval of the present 
government in Tajikistan, UN support, and cooperation of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI]. The IRI, which is striving to 
restore peace in combination with tranquillity and stability in 
Tajikistan, stressed from the beginning that the military option 
cannot solve this country's political and economic problems; and 
the only way of resolving Tajikistan's difficulties is 
establishment of national reconciliation government.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, addressing graduates 
of our country's Foreign Ministry Diplomatic Studies Centers, 
has stressed the need for training loyal and specialist forces 
in foreign policy matters, particularly in the Islamic world and 
Islamic states. He said: At present, in the struggle against 
anti-human affairs and the creation of an independent movement, 
the Islamic Republic has gained valuable and long-term 
experience which could become a model for the freindly and 
peaceloving countries of the world. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani added: Iran's foreign policy does not 
pursue any other objective but prosperity for the oppressed 
nations and the promotion of Islam, and is not contaminated with 
those selfish policies currently practised in the arrogant world. 
  Referring to the Hebron mosque incident, the president said: 
Since the formation of Zionism in the world, there has been more 
wars, economic pressure, destruction of man-made and natural 
resources, and more instances of harm to popular regimes and 
revolutionary states. This issue must be investigated and 
studied by diplomats so as to adopt a proper stand against it. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed confidence that the Islamic 
ummah, through extensive participation in the international 
Jerusalem Day rallies, will demonstrate another proper response 
in the face of this horrific crime. 
  At the start of this meeting Foreign Minister Velayati 
presented a report on special courses for training foreign 
diplomats.

  [Editorial Report] Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran First Program Network at 0345 GMT on 6 March broadcasts a 
special 45-minute feature on Jerusalem Day, which is to be 
celebrated on Friday, 11 March. The feature includes a brief 
opening talk by the announcer, who says: "If we want to examine 
the al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque massacre, we can see that, 
contrary to the allegations by the regime occupying Jerusalem, 
the massacre of the worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi mosque was not 
a spontaneous act by a group of extremists but the starting 
point of a series of acts that are being perpetrated by the 
Zionist government in a bid to achieve a special objective. If 
we want to understand this better, we have to look at the recent 
U.S.-Israeli act in the region. What the West is propounding as 
the peace process only mentions the word peace and pursues very 
specific objectives." 
  The announcer then goes on to say: "The first objective that 
international Zionism is pursuing is to extinguish the burning 
flames of the intifadah, which is considered to be one of the 
most dangerous political-social phenomena of the region for 
Israel, the United States, and even the corrupt regimes around 
them. International Zionism considers the intifadah to be yet 
another fruit of the Islamic revival process, which is 
threatening the interests and objectives of the regime occupying 
Jerusalem." 
  Then the guest of the feature, Hoseyn Sheykholeslam, Iranian 
deputy foreign minister for Arab and African affairs, is asked 
to comment on the Hebron massacre. In answer to a question on 
what objective the Zionists are pursuing in the incident, 
Sheykholeslam says: "The Zionists' objective is very simple. 
They do not want there to be any Palestinian in Palestine. 
They do not want any non-Israeli or anyone who does not believe 
in world domination by Zionism to be in Israel. Israel has a 
big strategic plan for this purpose. This plan has political, 
international, economic, propaganda, social, and psychological 
aspects. It has been following this plan for more than 50 years 
in various stages. It has almost succeeded, especially with the 
implementation of the Camp David agreement as well as the 
compromise plans that have emerged, one by one, after Camp 
David." 
  Sheykholeslam then refers to the Islamic revolution in Iran 
and says that one of the most important aspects of the 
revolution was the method that Imam Khomeyni used in directing 
the revolution: "a method that displayed the true power of the 
nation, something that we saw in our revolution and what we are 
witnessing in Palestine today." Sheykholeslam says: "This 
massacre was actually a follow-up to the psychological-social 
plan to spread fear in the hearts of the Palestinians so that 
they will become dissatisfied with their life in Palestine and 
will leave their territories and go." Sheykholeslam discusses 
how the same method is being used in the field of economics by 
"increasing inflation at home" so that the Palestinians will not 
be able to lead a good life and will have to leave the country. 
  Later in the feature and after music and slogans, 
Sheykholeslam is asked to give details on the Hebron incident 
and to comment: "It is good to note that the majority of the 
martyrs were between 18 and 25 years of age. This shows how 
close this [Palestinian] revolution is to our revolution. Like 
the role that the youths played in our revolution, the youths 
there have now come onto the scene. The youths have stolen the 
scene from the nationalists, politicians, and communists and it 
is the Muslims who are on the scene now. Fortunately, this 
trend is growing more and more each day. The last base of the 
nationalists was al-Khalil which, I think, will be taken out of 
the Israelis' hands with this incident." 
  The feature goes on to broadcast phone calls from listeners 
who express their readiness to fight next to the Palestinians. 
Sheykholeslam then says: "The nation is well aware that this 
war, the war that is going on in Palestine, is one between Islam 
and blasphemy. The future of the world will be determined by 
this war. Whether we want it or not, the future of the world 
will be determined by a confrontation between Islam led by the 
pure Muhammedan Islam, which His Eminence the Imam propounded in 
Iran, on the one side and arrogance, which is led by the United 
States and Israel, on the other." 
  Later in the program the announcer asks Sheykholeslam to 
comment on the opinion by many analysts that "there is a link 
between the massacre of Muslims in Palestine and the massacre of 
Muslims elsewhere, namely in Bosnia-Herzegovina." Sheykholeslam 
says that as previously stated: "The future war will be one 
between Islam, especially the outlook of our nation and its 
leadership on the one side, and arrogance in general on the 
other. Each and every Muslim, wherever he may be, is considered 
a potential enemy to them. The more combatant a Muslim is, a 
bigger enemy he is for them. And if there is the possibility 
that he can form Islamic rule, even a rule by Muslims, this is 
considered a greater threat to them. The crime that you are 
witnessing in Bosnia-Herzegovina today is being done to prevent 
the Muslims there from forming a country and an Islamic rule. I 
do not know why it is, but apparently it is God's wish that the 
hotter this furnace of struggle becomes, the more combatant the 
elements that emerge from it are. According to the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, if it was not for this struggle they would 
not have been able to become acquainted with Islam in this way, 
and if this genocide had not continued, they would not have come 
so close to the Islamic Republic and the mode of our thoughts. 
The same applies to Palestine. Today's Palestinians are much 
closer to us than the Palestinian of the pro-Camp David era." 
  The feature continues with more phone calls. The last 
question asked of Sheykholslam is what significance the people's 
presence at the Jerusalem Day march has. Sheykholeslam says: 
"Our nation should know that arrogance wants to convince the 
Palestinians that they do not have anyone to support them. This 
is the policy that is aimed at spreading disillusionment. But 
our nation should know that by coming to the scene and to the 
marches, it shows that it is next to the Palestinian nation. It 
will encourage the Palestinians. And this is exactly the 
opposite of the policy that arrogance wants to impose. Our 
Palestinian brothers believe that Muslims bearing black flags 
will come from the east and will liberate Palestine. Maybe this 
means the black chadors [veils] of the Iranian nation. You know 
that our nation, and especially the women, impressed the West 
with their black chadors and conveyed a special message. This 
belief by the Palestinian nation may mean this. At any rate, 
the Palestinian nation, which arrogance tried to disillusion as 
much as possible, is powerfully on the scene today and should be 
supported by our nation in every possible way, the most simple 
of which may be presence at the Jerusalem Day march."

Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, by an unidentified KEYHAN correspondent 
in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] The secretary general of the Islamic Jihad in 
Palestine Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi and the secretary general of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] Nayif 
Hawatimah answered questions put by a KEYHAN correspondent in 
Damascus on the dimensions of the Hebron catastrophe. 
  We now present the exclusive interviews with these 
Palestinian personalities: 
  Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, the secretary general of the Islamic 
Jihad in Palestine, elaborated on the organization's stance on 
the killing of dozens of Palestinian Muslims in the mosque of 
the Prophet Abraham (peace be upon bim) in Hebron in an 
exclusive interview with our correspondent in Damascus. 
  He said: This massacre was not at all unexpected, as the 
criminal Zionists have been perpetrating the most heinous crimes 
in the past 50 years against the Muslim Palestinian nation. 
  He added: The criminal Zionists believe they can achieve 
their unholy objectives by martyring the greatest number of 
Palestinian Muslims and by driving the Palestinian nation out of 
the country. 
  Regarding the joint plot by the Zionist armed forces and the 
Jewish settlers in carrying out the massacre, Dr. al-Shiqaqi 
stated: Naturally, the Zionist armed forces jointly carried out 
this crime, because, in the past, 40 soldiers have been on guard 
at the mosque round the clock. But at the time this crime was 
committed, only two or three soldiers were at the scene of the 
crime. They assisted the attacking settlers and provided them 
with the necessary arms and equipment to kill the greatest 
number of worshippers. 
  He said: After committing the catastrophic crime, the 
criminals easily fled the scene with the help of the Zionist 
armed forces. He blamed the government of Yitzhaq Rabin for the 
crime and said: There is no doubt that the Rabin government had 
all the information on this crime before it was perpetrated and 
even prepared the conditions for killing the Palestinian Muslims. 
  On the condemnation of the crime by Yasir 'Arafat, he said: 
It is absurd that Rabin and Clinton also condemned the crime, 
when they are accomplices to the crime, the natural result of 
the treasonous PLO accord with the Zionist regime plotted by the 
United States. 
  On the future response by the Palestinian organizations to 
this atrocity, Dr. al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation does not fear 
intimidation or martyrdom and will continue the intifadah. The 
Palestinian guerrillas will, helped by almighty God, very soon 
deliver a shattering blow to the Zionists and those who have 
compromised with them. We will soon avenge the blood of the 
martyrs of the Hebron Mosque. 
  Referring to the stances of international organizations on 
this crime, al-Shiqaqi stated: Our nation pays no attention to 
these organizations' stances, as the United States is 
supervising them and using them. The international 
organizations claim to condemn the crime but have taken no 
important step to condemn the Zionist regime. The United States 
will never exert pressure on Israel for committing this crime. 
  Commenting on the possibility of 'Arafat capitalizing on the 
crime at the mosque, the secretary general of Islamic Jihad in 
Palestine said: Instead of taking a stance against the Zionist 
regime, 'Arafat has agreed to accept the U.S. Government's 
invitation to continue talks with Rabin to rein in the 
intifadah. On principle, 'Arafat has become an agent for the 
policies of the United States and the Zionist regime to pave the 
way for killing more Palestinian Muslims. 
  Concluding, he alluded to the stances of the United States 
and some of the Western and regional countries asking the 
Palestinian organizations not to carry out guerrilla operations 
and to confine themselves to political measures and stated: The 
United States and the countries above wish to draw our nation 
into a compromise and will not give the Palestinian 
organizations permission to take any political action. But the 
Palestinian nation is determined to continue its struggle and 
soon, the flames of our nation's fury will descend upon the 
Zionists and upon those who have compromised and lethal blows 
will be dealt by means of armed struggle against the Zionist 
regime. The PLO accord with the Zionist regime will be thrown 
in the dustbin of history. 
  In his remarks to the KEYHAN correspondent, Nayif Hawatimah 
stated: The Zionist regime is the element behind the crime of 
killing the worshippers in al-Khalil and 'Arafat paved the way 
for its occurrence. According to Hawatimah, 'Arafat has made a 
two-faced statement. First, he claimed that a demented Israeli 
had committed the crime; he did this to prevent clashes from 
erupting and the intifadah from continuing. Second, 'Arafat 
openly held talks with Clinton and Rabin and accepted the 
Rabin-Clinton plan for reining in the Palestinian guerrilla 
operations. Hawatimah added: This atrocity has been committed 
as a result of the accord among the United States, Israel, and 
'Arafat and this compromise has been the catalyst for the 
heinous atrocity in Hebron. 
  Answering a question on whether he will only confine himself 
to political actions at this stage, Hawatimah declared: The DFLP 
has faith in political means and armed operations and will 
utilize every means to inflict a blow on the Israeli regime. He 
called on the Western countries to revoke all negotiations with 
the Zionist regime and asked the Arab countries to continue 
their economic siege of Israel. On the need for coordination 
among the Palestinian groups opposed to the trend of compromise, 
Hawatimah said: This coordination will continue without heeding 
the existing difficulties and the Palestinian organizations will 
continue to prepare the Palestinian nation for the intifadah and 
general strikes. 
  According to Hawatimah, the United States does not 
comprehend 
the real internal problems of Palestine and 'Arafat has no 
standing in the Palestinian nation. He cannot direct or rein in 
the intifadah. He added: The Zionist regime's massacres must be 
halted and the UN forces should be sent to the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip for this purpose. 
  Hawatimah stated: Extensive demonstrations continue on the 
West Bank, in Gaza, and in the Palestinian camps in Syria, 
Lebanon, and Jordan and general strikes have been announced for 
three days inside the occupied territories. The Zionists have 
given no privileges to 'Arafat and merely prepared themselves 
for committing more crimes against the Palestinian nation. Such 
crimes will continue to be perpetrated under the cover of the 
'Arafat-Rabin accord. 
  He also announced that the DFLP accepts UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and that the United Nations must send 
its troops to supervise the conditions inside the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip and should treat the occupied areas like those in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He appealed to Russia, the United States, 
and other countries to prevent new crimes against the 
Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cover for the al-Khalil Debacle"] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
  The United States has embarked on an action in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina calculated to divert world public opinion 
from the catastrophe of the Hebron massacre. The U.S. F-16s 
confronted the Serb fighter planes and downed four of them. 
  Even though this action was endorsed by NATO, it resembles 
more a "willful action" on the part of Washington in order to 
overshadow Israel's atrocity. The world's public is still 
fiercely and categorically protesting against the Zionists' 
crime--of killing fasting worshipers in the shrine of Prophet 
Abraham (peace be upon him) more than ever before. In the 
occupied territories, the Palestinians have also entered the 
fray with all their being against the Zionist armed forces. 
  In such circumstances, the U.S. action against the Serbs is 
more a decision to deliver Israel from the pressure of world 
public opinion than a move to chastise the Serbs, in order to 
defuse the importance and sensitivity of the debacle, and the 
carnage of Muslims at the hands of the Zionists, by trying to 
eclipse it with reports on Bosnian issues. 
  In addition, this will also provide Washington and NATO 
members with the opportunity to project it as a decisive blow 
against the Serbs and to douse the inflamed sentiments of the 
world regarding the overt and covert collusion of the West and 
the savage Serbs and to give the impression that it did not 
remain an idle spectator. Washington's action can also be 
construed as ridiculing Russia. The Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev had earlier warned the West that every action 
with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina should be coordinated with 
Moscow. Thus, by means of this willful act, Washington tried to 
convey the impression that it reserves the right to take the 
initiative in Bosnia-Herzegovina and does not need any 
coordination with Moscow. 
  This means that the downing of some Serb planes can be 
considered a multi-pronged maneuver from the vantage point of 
Washington without any overt negative aspects for the United 
States, especially since it could also serve to divert the 
wounded sensitivities of the Islamic world from the bitter 
Hebron incident toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. This would be like 
saying that the United States is not the enemy of Muslims 
everywhere and it has taken action at least in their favor in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  If this is the posture favored by Washington, then it is 
certain that Washington will not take any more such actions and 
will constantly seek to magnify this particular action from its 
propaganda loudspeakers. The reason is clear. Reports received 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina show that the Muslim-inhabited areas 
continue to be repeatedly bombed by Serb and Croat airplanes. 
Therefore, in order to preempt questions by the world public on 
its taking a stance against the Serbs, it has taken this action 
to prove that it can enter the fray against these crimes and if 
it stops midway, naturally this would be attributed to the 
European members of NATO. 
  In clearer terms, it means that Washington wants to show 
that 
it wishes to confront the Serbs, but it is the European coterie 
of NATO, in which there is no consensus in this regard. This 
vantage point is more in harmony with Washington's past 
propaganda, as Washington has constantly sought to exonerate 
itself from being accused of prevarication and indecisiveness in 
its approach to Serbian crimes. 
  Despite all the above, the heinous atrocities of Israel in 
the occupied territories should not be eclipsed by other events. 
Following the pogrom in the al-Ibrahimi shrine--instead of 
adopting a more peace-seeking attitude--Israel has intensified 
its crimes. Israel has attributed this massacre to a demented 
individual. If one such lunatic an commit such a crime, there 
is no dearth of such serial madmen in the chain of command in 
the Israeli armed forces and who will naturally continue to 
threaten, intimidate, torture, and kill every Palestinian at 
every moment in their homes, mosques, and streets. 
  All the facts and figures indicate that this time the 
Palestinians have entered the arena with greater strength and 
determination as they sense, with all their being, that their 
existence and life is linked to revenge on the Zionists and only 
revenge on the enemy-- with all its serious dimensions--will 
make the bestial usurpers regret and refrain from greater crime 
and slaughter. 
  It is precisely for this reason that a seething wave of 
protests, strikes, and uprisings has erupted all over occupied 
Palestine and without any regard for the treacherous 
compromising faction, the Palestinians are prepared to tackle 
the Zionists decisively. It seems highly unlikely that the 
deterrent and defensive actions by Israel will prove effective 
in combating this tidal wave of fury and general hatred in the 
occupied territories. 
  The closure of the al-Ibrahimi shrine and promises of 
reparations cannot heal the wounded sensitivities of the 
Muslims, nor can it lessen the extent of the protest. By 
pledging to pay reparations, Israel has resorted to a new ploy, 
that, on the one hand it can carry out the butchery of 
Palestinian Muslims, and on the other hand it can pay 
reparations as blood money. In this manner, Israel is in fact 
paying blood money for its own victims so that it can continue 
perpetrating its crimes with a free hand. In fact, by offering 
to pay compensation, the Zionists are diverting the issue from 
its main path and are attempting to depict it as an accidental 
and unwanted occurrence, while it is really a preplanned and 
willful action in which the Israeli armed forces certainly 
played the primary role. 
  In addition, such a proposal also indicates that pressure is 
so great on Israel that it is forced to promise compensation and 
naturally the Palestinians will not agree and will not settle 
for anything less than the impeachment and penalizing of the 
agents of this crime and by revenge on the savage Zionists.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Close to the end of the visit to Tehran by China's 
foreign minister and vice premier, Qian Qichen, Mr. Dinesh 
Singh, India's external affairs minister, arrived in the Iranian 
capital. Concurrence of the visits of these two major strategic 
Asian countries' foreign ministers to Tehran has drawn attention 
of the world's political circles to the tripartite talks among 
Iran, India, and China. Significance of this matter lies in the 
fact that, under the new global conditions, the concept of 
security and power has undergone a change in qualitative terms. 
The world is now about to enter the phase where political, 
economic, and military regionalism will replace earlier 
equations of polarized power in the Cold War era at 
international level. 
  It is assumed the strategic location of the three 
interrelated zones in geographical and historical terms--namely, 
the Islamic zone and the zones of the Chinese and Indian 
civilizations--under the new global conditions and in a 
realistic survey, can turn India, Iran, and China into a 
well-integrated group. Upon adding Pakistan to this group, one 
can say that there will emerge a regional power pole. Such a 
pole will have an undeniable impact in safeguarding regional and 
world peace and in motivating national development in these 
countries. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran is the center of the Islamic 
civilization. India, too, is the center of the Indian 
civilization, while China enjoys a similar position in the 
Confucian civilization. Growth of mutual cooperation in these 
three zones of historic civilization can strengthen Asia's 
independence in all aspects. The factor which can turn such an 
alliance into a desirable group in the contemporary world 
underlies that the group enjoys all resources for development in 
terms of natural resources, work force, and technology. 
  Based on the vastness of the groups geographical 
limits--ranging from the Middle East to the Indian subcontinent 
and east Asia--and its population, which is nearly half of the 
world, this point becomes clear. In the event of total 
realization of these resources, not only the group will be able 
to respond to all of its needs but will also become a model 
encouraging the enhancement of cooperation in the entire Asian 
continent. 
  Upon considering the triangle of power, comprising Tehran, 
New Delhi, and Beijing as a well integrated group, one can say 
without any doubt that the equation of international power will 
come to face more diverse pressures from the Western world and 
the new UN-sponsored world order. Such a situation will not 
only increase this group's power to confront the covetous 
designs of the West but will also boost the capacity of each of 
the countries included in this power triangle for confrontation 
in political and economic spheres.

  [Text] In a historic decision, the UN Human Rights 
Commission has condemned terrorism in all its manifestation as a 
violation of human rights. The ongoing 50th session at Geneva 
last night adopted a consensus resolution to this effect despite 
Islamabad's intense behind-the-scene lobby to thwart it. The 
resolution for the first time recognizes the effect of terrorism 
on human rights, a point which has been hammered at by India at 
all the international fora in the wake of transborder export of 
terrrorism into Jammu and Kashmir. According to observers, the 
decision will have serious implications for Pakistan-sponsored 
terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir. The resolution 
reiterates the United Nation's unequivocal condemnation of 
terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as acts of 
aggression aimed at the destruction of human integrity and 
security of states, destabilizing legitimately constituted 
governments, and having adverse consequences on the economic and 
social development of the states. It calls upon the states to 
take effective measures to prevent, combat, and eliminate 
terrorism. The resolution urges the international community to 
enhance cooperation to fight terrorism at various levels. 
  India has urged the UN Human Rights Commission members to 
vote against the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. Addressing the 
ongoing session of the commission at Geneva last night, veteran 
diplomat and former foreign secretary, Mr. T.N. Kaul, said that 
the resolution has serious and dangerous implications that could 
allow any country to infringe on the national independence and 
sovereignty of others. Mr. Kaul was exercising the second right 
of reply to Pakistan's allegations against india on the Kashmir 
situation.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Olaf Ihlau and </F>
Volkhard Windfuhr in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chairman, the massacre in Hebron 
is a disaster for the peace process in the Middle East. Will 
the "peace of the courageous," as President Clinton praised the 
historic agreement achieved by you and Israeli head of 
government Yitzhaq Rabin, now end in a capitulation of the 
discouraged? 
  ['Arafat] There is no doubt that Hebron was an attack on the 
peace process. I had just signed an agreement with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Cairo, which dealt with 
confidence building measures and the loosening of the "iron 
fist" policy that is pursued by Israel. For instance, a large 
number of interned Palestinians were supposed to be released. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Peres promised you this action for the 
beginning of Ramadan, the month of fasting? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, but this has not taken place. Instead, our 
people and the entire world were surprised by the massacre. 
Since the signing of the peace agreement last September, 
Israel's leadership has constantly engaged in maneuvers to avoid 
the implementation of the treaty. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You get the impression that Rabin is 
deliberately playing for time? 
  ['Arafat] Of course. It was Rabin who said: "There are no 
sacrosanct deadlines or topics for negotiation." Thus, the 
Israeli leadership is fully responsible for the delays in 
implementing the agreement. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But Rabin called you immediately after the 
massacre and expressed shock about the bloody deed. 
  ['Arafat] This is true. However, what happened there in 
reality? I was immediately in contact with the hospitals and 
the injured people. I got the impression -- and I told Rabin so 
-- that the Israeli Army had made common cause with the 
extremist settlers. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because the guards at the Ibrahim Mosque did 
not intervene? 
  ['Arafat] No one can enter this mosque without permission by 
the Israeli guards. How was it possible for a group -- because 
it can hardly have been an individual -- to enter there? The 
Israelis claim that the killer fired only 114 shots. However, 
the number of those killed and injured was 322. At least 1,000 
shots were fired. some of the praying people were hit by several 
bullets. There were seven bullets in the muezzin's body alone. 
How can 114 shots cause so much damage? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How did Rabin respond to your assertions? 
  ['Arafat] "Investigations are under way," he said. "What 
kind of investigations?" I asked him and I made it clear to him 
that I have clear facts. Several believers were shot directly 
by the Israeli Army -- at the portal, when they came out of the 
mosque.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ...this sounds as if this had not been a mad 
deed by Jewish extremist Goldstein but a conspiracy. 
  ['Arafat] And it continues like that. Since the massacre we 
have had 28 martyrs and about 300 injured. This is a constant 
bloodbath, committed by Israeli Army soldiers, who patrol 
together with armed settlers. And then Rabin just tells me: 
"Investigations are under way." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you want to say that Rabin has lost control 
or that he is part of a conspiracy? 
  ['Arafat] He himself should comment on that. I just present 
the facts; others can judge them. But I have the right to ask: 
Is there a secret organization in the Israeli Army in league 
with the armed settlers? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin and you probably knew what could happen. 
When the two of you met for the first time in President 
Clinton's presence before the ceremony for signing the agreement 
in Washington, you briefly discussed that. 
  ['Arafat] Nonsense, we did not exchange a word at that time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin said in an interview with DER SPIEGEL 
that you both noted that implementing the agreement would be 
"very difficult." 
  ['Arafat] When the three of us were together, we were 
silent. Clinton asked us not to make any comments before the 
agreement was signed. We adhered to that. President Clinton is 
my witness. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Nevertheless, both sides knew about the 
potential danger emanating from the extremists in both camps. 
  ['Arafat] If Rabin knew it, then why did he delay the 
implementation of the agreement? I emphatically warned him 
during our subsequent meetings: If we do not make progress 
quickly, we will get into great difficulties. Therefore, we 
have to act quickly. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Obviously, Rabin was not quite of that 
opinion. 
  ['Arafat] There is a very mean sentence by Rabin. He said: 
"I will let 'Arafat sweat." 
  [DER SPIEGEL] It is undisputed that most Israelis are 
outraged and ashamed about the massacre of Hebron. 
  ['Arafat] This would then be a very good opportunity for 
Rabin to put the curb on his people and to take specific steps, 
if he is really interested in peace. So far, he has not done 
anything except talk. Six months have passed since the 
Washington agreement, and Rabin is always just talking about the 
settlers' safety. Now, however, everybody realizes that the 
safety of the Palestinian people is in the foreground first. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you leave open the question of the 
Jewish settlements, which is perhaps the key problem for peace, 
at the secret negotiations in Oslo? 
  ['Arafat] We did not exclude this topic at all; it is on our 
agenda. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But, according to the Oslo Declaration of 
Principles, this issue has to be negotiated only "at the 
beginning of the third year of the transition period." 
  ['Arafat] Now you listen to me: The topic "Jewish settlers" 
was on our agenda in Oslo, in Washington, in Davos, and in 
Cairo. However, the Israelis are postponing discussion on this 
matter and remain inflexible, while I was very flexible. 
  After the signing of the Cairo agreement, Peres boasted in 
the Knesset that he had repeatedly "defeated" 'Arafat. What is 
that supposed to mean? I did not react to that. Such 
statements show that the Israelis basically want to force us to 
make concessions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The Israelis claim the same thing about you. 
  ['Arafat] They interpret our flexibility as their victory. 
For us flexibility means coming a bit closer to peace. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How are things now supposed to continue? How 
can the train of peace be put back on its track? 
  ['Arafat] This is not our responsibility. Now the 
co-sponsors should take care of that, those who signed the 
treaty together with us, such as President Clinton. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin does not want to heed any of your 
demands, which exceed the formulations of the Oslo agreement. 
He wants neither to disarm the settlers nor to dissolve the 
settlements. 
  ['Arafat] The Oslo agreement speaks only of two authorities: 
the Israeli Army in the territories where it is stationed and 
the Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. It does not say a word 
about a third authority -- the settlers. The Israeli Army is 
supposed to ensure the protection of the settlers. For what do 
the settlers need weapons then? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After all, Jewish settlers have also been 
killed by Palestinians. 
  ['Arafat] Do not forget that Hebron was not the first 
massacres committed against Palestinians. A massacre also took 
place in 1990 in the front yard of the al-'Aqsa Mosque in 
Jerusalem. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] If it comes to calculating, the Israelis 
accuse the Arabs of the massacre in the synagogue in Istanbul, 
where 22 Jews were killed seven years ago. 
  ['Arafat] Why do you say things like that? I was not 
responsible for that. These were extremists. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Once again, how do you want to make progress 
now? 
  ['Arafat] Do not ask me but Rabin, because it is his 
business to make progress with the process. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you believe that the Israelis do not want 
peace? 
  ['Arafat] So far, it looks as if they did not want peace. I 
am a pragmatist and realist, and it is the facts that count for 
me. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After the disappointments of the past months, 
have you lost the courage to follow the path toward peace 
unfalteringly? 
  ['Arafat] I am not joking about such things. The decision 
for peace is not my personal decision but that of the PLO 
Central Council. If I want to turn the helm around again, I 
have to go to the Central Council again. We are proud of our 
democracy; I am not a dictator. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You have repeatedly said that the peace 
process is irreversible. 
  ['Arafat] Yes, but it seems that the Israelis, who signed 
the agreement too, do not respect this decision. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But what would be the alternative to the peace 
process -- did you and Rabin not long ago reach the point where 
one can only take the bull by the horns and not turn back again? 
  ['Arafat] Rabin is obviously not willing to join in. He is 
still waiting for me to sweat, as he says. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How long can you still sweat? 
  ['Arafat] Rabin should know how persistent I am. In 1982 
he, together with Defense Minister Sharon, looked for me in vain 
in Beirut for three months. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will the Hebron massacre not be evidence for 
many that peaceful coexistence of the 1 million Palestinians and 
the 120,000 Jewish settlers is impossible? 
  ['Arafat] Rabin has insisted often enough that Israel does 
not need the settlements, which were established for political 
motives.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] ....but he wants to keep those of the total 
144 settlements in Gaza and the West Bank that are relevant for 
security. 
  ['Arafat] He could evacuate the settlements held by Jewish 
extremists and fanatics. We will see what happens. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This seems to be a path toward a solution: 
giving up the settlements in particularly sensitive places, such 
as Hebron, Gaza, and Nablus? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, the elimination of these political 
settlements that are now hotbeds of danger. This would be my 
advice. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will Palestinian policemen protect Jewish 
settlers, if they are attacked? 
  ['Arafat] This must still be negotiated in the autonomy 
talks, but first the settlers must be disarmed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin would hardly survive this in domestic 
policy at the moment. 
  ['Arafat] He could at least start with the fanatics. In any 
case, one of the most important points that we must discuss soon 
is the final status of the settlements. According to the text 
of the framework agreement, this should be done as soon as 
possible. But Rabin is delaying everything and is playing for 
time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why? What could he gain by doing that? 
  ['Arafat] One of his goals is to weaken me. Can you explain 
to me why else he is insulting me and boasting that he is 
letting me sweat? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] We do not understand this logic, because after 
you he will have to deal with the gentlemen of the more radical 
HAMAS. 
  ['Arafat] You had better ask him that himself. Of course, I 
have my thoughts about that, but I prefer to keep them to myself. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is it not absurd to assume that 100 years of 
hatred and distrust between Jews and Palestinians can be 
overcome within a few months, by decree, so to speak? 
  ['Arafat] What does the term "peace of the courageous" mean? 
That one must be ready to face all difficulties. What did De 
Gaulle do, what are De Klerk and Mandela doing? Where there is 
a will, there is a way. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In Jerusalem fliers of your al-Fatah movement 
now call for "revenge by all means." A retaliatory massacre on 
Jews would probably torpedo the peace process once and for all. 
  ['Arafat] How enormous do you think the pressure of our 
grass-roots is? The situation is extremely critical. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you no longer have your young people under 
control and those activists who accuse you of having made too 
many concessions to Israel? 
  ['Arafat] These critics have not felt any improvement of the 
living conditions since the signing of the agreement in 
Washington. On the contrary, they see that the occupation army 
is getting increasingly brutal. Just because of this potential 
of danger we should come to an agreement as quickly as possible. 
The Israelis must withdraw quickly. As soon as the first 
soldiers and administrative officials have been withdrawn from 
the autonomous areas, the tensions will ease automatically. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Even your most loyal followers think that you 
are in hellish difficulties and that the radicals are on their 
way up. 
  ['Arafat] Yes, we have to expect that. What is going on in 
the occupied territories now gives an impetus to the extremists. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] On both sides. 
  ['Arafat] The worse thing is that the peace process is 
pushed into a corner. I myself still have several options. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Who can save the peace process in the Middle 
East? 
  ['Arafat] Washington together with the Israelis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Abu 'Ammar, you have always led a dangerous 
life, but this agreement with Israel puts you under a 
particularly great risk. Is it still worth the danger? 
  ['Arafat] The basic cause is worth it. The important thing 
is not I but our children's future. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Where is the threshold that you will not 
cross? 
  ['Arafat] It will not be I who decide on this issue but the 
Palestinian leadership. At the moment we are discussing a new 
assessment of the overall situation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When will you be in Jericho, and when will 
your wish to pray in the al-'Aqsa Mosque be fulfilled? 
  ['Arafat] I should have been there long ago, but now I would 
prefer not to commit myself to a date. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds like someone who has lost his 
illusions. 
  ['Arafat] Are six months of waiting for the fulfillment of 
promises made in the agreement and then the Hebron massacre not 
sufficient to achieve that? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rabin tells us that in 1994 the Middle East 
will reach a turning point: The signs are either indicating 
peace or new confrontations in the long term. Do you agree with 
him in this respect? 
  ['Arafat] These words mean that Rabin will not withdraw from 
the occupied territories. He is the one who is holding the key 
to peace in his hands, not me. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Chairman, thank you for this interview.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 1 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Reaction to Hebron Mosque Massacre 
  2. Signs of Islamic Victory in Algeria 
  3. Call for Trial of Minister Yusuf Wali 
  4. Commentary on Kuwait and Iraq 
  5. Article by Bosnian President Izetbegovic 
  6. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali's Column 
<H5>  REACTION TO HEBRON MOSQUE MASSACRE </H5>
  In its 1 March issue, the newspaper AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of 
the opposition Labor Party, carries extensive reports, comments, 
and articles on the 25 February massacre at the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron. On pages 1 and 7, it features a 480-word 
statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood denouncing this "ugly 
criminal, an incident that shows the perfidious and corrupt 
nature inherent in the treacherous enemy." The statement calls 
for placing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem under 
international supervision and for sending international forces 
to protect the unarmed civilians. 
  On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper publishes an 850-word 
statement issued by the Labor Party condemning the massacre and 
describing it as "one of the ugliest criminal acts ever 
committed." 
  On page 7, the newspaper publishes a joint statement issued 
by the Muslim Brotherhood, the Labor Party, the Wafd Party, the 
Liberal Party, the al-Azhar 'Ulema Front, and some public 
figures, trade unionists, and writers denouncing the incident. 
  On pages 1 and 7, the newspaper carries an 800-word report 
by 
Mahmud Bakri, who castigates the Egyptian Government for not 
being outspoken in condemning the attack. He says: "While the 
ugly massacre has exposed the indifference of the international 
community, especially the U.S., which colludes with and supports 
Israel, Egypt has contented itself with condemning the 
massacre." This Egyptian stance has provoked "broad popular 
anger," more so because the "Egyptian Government has not 
declared a state of mourning for the souls of the martyrs and 
has taken no measures to confront the aggressors." Blaming 
Israel for the blast at a Maronite Church on 27 February, Bakri 
says: "The Zionists have decided to escalate their war against 
Muslims and Christians by sowing sedition between them to 
deflect attention from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre." 
  On pages 1 and 7, AL-SHA'B also carries a 1,000-word report 
on the various demonstrations that have erupted at Egyptian 
universities to protest the "ugly massacre" against the 
Palestinians in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. The reports 
adds that "violent clashes" occurred between the Cairo 
University students and the police, who used tear gas to 
disperse the demonstrators marching toward the Israeli Embassy. 
  On page 2, the newspaper publishes a 1,500-word article by 
Majdi Ahmad Husayn in which he describes the massacre as 
"unprecedented" and the "fruit of the wicked policy" of the Arab 
and Muslim rulers, a policy that has led Muslims to be 
"slaughtered like lambs." He criticizes the Arab governments, 
especially the Egyptian Government, for saying that peace will 
be pursued despite the massacre. He goes on to say: "Israel's 
friends in Egypt and the Arab world are accomplices in this 
massacre, because they have taught Israel to do to us what it 
wants." He adds that the Egyptian Government, which has 
portrayed the "crippled" Gaza-Jericho agreement as a victory and 
a solution of the Palestinian issue, is now completely exposed, 
naked, without a "fig leaf" to cover itself. The writer calls 
for the "popular trial" of Yusuf Wali, secretary general of the 
ruling National Democratic Party, for his "subversive role in 
supporting Israel at the expense of his country's interests." 
He adds that force should be met with greater force, saying: 
"There must be revenge. We must inflict wounds on the 
Israelis. We must strike them on the head. We must strike them 
everywhere. This is God's law." 
  On page 2, the newspaper carries a 700-word article by Dr. 
Mahjub 'Umar in which he says that Israel's current leaders, 
including Rabin and Peres, were directly behind the massacre to 
achieve external and internal political objectives. 
  On page 3, the newspaper carries a 2,000-word investigative 
report by Mahmud Bakri in which he interviews several figures on 
their reaction to the massacre. Among those interviewed are Dr. 
Ahmad Sidqi al-Dajani, a Palestinian opposed to the Gaza-Jericho 
accord; Cairo University President Dr. Mufid Shihab; Hafiz 
Isma'il, former adviser for Egyptian national security; 
'Ali-al-Din Salih, leader of the Misr al-Fatah Party; and 
AL-AHRAM Chief Editor Salah-al-Din Hafiz. They all denounce the 
massacre. 
  On page 5, the newspaper carries a 1,000-word article by 
Mustafa Mashhur, deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. He 
asks: "Who can guarantee that this massacre will not be 
repeated" and "How can peace be achieved in this charged 
atmosphere." He also asks what is the use of Rabin's 
expressions of regret over the incident and Clinton's remarks 
that it should not obstruct the peace process. Mahjub 
sarcastically congratulates 'Arafat on the condolences he has 
received from some heads of state and for the Israeli 
Government's readiness to compensate the relatives of the 
victims. He adds that the Palestinian people will not forget 
this incident and will take their revenge on the "Zionist enemy." 

<H5>    SIGNS OF ISLAMIC VICTORY IN ALGERIA </H5>
  An unattributed 300-word report on page 1 describes the 
Algerian authorities' recent release of several Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] leaders as a "victory for the Islamist 
current in Algeria." The newspaper links this release with 
reports on "an impending Cabinet reshuffle in Algeria in which 
Islamist elements might join the government." This will be 
considered a victory for the FIS and an admission by the 
Algerian authorities of the broad popular support for FIS 
leaders. 
<H5>  CALL FOR TRIAL OF MINISTER YUSUF WALI </H5>
  AL-SHA'B continues its long campaign against Dr. Yusuf Wali, 
deputy prime minister and agriculture minister and secretary 
general of the ruling National Democratic Party, for his alleged 
pro-Israeli views and stands. On page 5, it carries a 
3,000-word article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of 
the Labor Party, in which he urges a "popular trial" for Wali, 
who "deliberately" delivered an "official" statement before the 
People's Assembly praising Israel's scientific and technological 
superiority. He calls on the Egyptian people to act to remove 
this "shame." He maintains that Wali could be politically 
tried "according to Article No. 159 of the Constitution, which 
gives the People's Assembly the right to refer a minister to 
trial" for the crimes he commits while performing his duties. 
He further maintains that this popular move does not absolve 
the president from using his powers to question the minister 
about his actions and behavior; otherwise, the people will be 
excused for believing that the president approves of Wali's 
statement before the People's Assembly on 5 February. 
<H5>  COMMENTARY ON KUWAIT AND IRAQ </H5>
  On page 8, the newspaper publishes a 1,000-word article by 
Mahmud Shukri entitled "Kuwait Celebrates the U.S. Victory and 
the Victim is the Iraqi People." He says: "Tomorrow, drums 
will be beaten in Kuwait on the anniversary of the 
Anglo-U.S.-Israeli victory in the Gulf." He adds: "Those who 
celebrate the 3d anniversary of the Arab massacre in Iraq, what 
do they celebrate?" "Do they celebrate because they have 
enabled the imperialist forces in the United States, France, and 
England to destroy a Muslim Arab country." "Do they celebrate 
because they have turned Kuwait into a Western military base?" 
<H5>  ARTICLE BY BOSNIAN PRESIDENT IZETBEGOVIC </H5>
  On page 9, AL-SHA'B publishes an 800-word article by Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic entitled "Islam Between East and 
West." He maintains that Western civilization can't face the 
invasion of licentiousness that is destroying it. He cites the 
high crime and suicide rates in the United States and Europe and 
attributes them to licentiousness and alcohol abuse. 
<H5>  SHAYKH MUHAMMAD AL-GHAZALI'S COLUMN </H5>
  On page 12, the newspaper carries a regular column by 
Islamic 
preacher Muhammad al-Ghazali entitled "This is our Religion." 
In his 500-word column, al-Ghazali says the United States is a 
superpower and a very civilized country. But there are 
disturbing health, social, and mental conditions in the United 
States, he says, citing the U.S. health secretary on the number 
of crimes and diseases. He says the United States, "which 
excels scientifically and industrially, is backward religiously 
and morally." He contends that instead of reforming its 
internal conditions, the United States is busy fighting Islam.

<F P=106> [By Hanadi Salman] </F>
  [Text] Sudanese opposition sources have revealed that there 
is a plan to topple Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir's 
regime. It primarily presupposes the establishment of safe areas 
in southern Sudan, the intervention of foreign forces, and the 
imposition of an air, economic, oil, and military embargo on 
Khartoum in preparation for an entry by the opposition forces, 
which are currently deployed in one of the neighboring 
countries, to overpower the regime. But the opposition 
"al-Ummah" Party has doubts about this plan's success. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-SAFIR, opposition sources 
in 
London said that forces belonging to one of the "northern" 
opposition parties are now deployed all along Sudan's borders 
with one of its neighboring countries, which recently became 
embroiled in a dispute with Khartoum after accusing the 
al-Bashir government of harboring and supporting opposition 
groups from that country. 
  The sources, which declined to reveal their identity, added 
that a meeting of the Sudanese opposition parties in the British 
House of Lords late last week sponsored by Baroness Caroline Cox 
had called on the international community to establish "safe 
areas" in southern Sudan and to impose an air, economic, 
military, and oil embargo on Khartoum that would weaken 
al-Bashir's government enough to allow the opposition to enter 
the capital and remove the regime. 
  The sources explained that the safe areas to be established 
would not only include southern areas (that is the provinces of 
Bahr al-Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Equatoria) but would be extended 
to include what is known as the disputed "ravaged areas," on 
which there is no agreement yet as to whether they are 
"southern" or "northern". Some of these include parts of the 
provinces of Darfur, Kordofan (Jabal al-Nuba), and al-Anqasta. 
This means reducing the borders of the northern area to a 
minimum. 
  The sources went on to say that a simultaneous declaration 
of 
an embargo on Khartoum would tighten the noose around the 
al-Bashir government, together with the closure of the borders 
with Libya and Chad and even Egypt, the closure of Port Sudan's 
harbor, and the isolation of the present government. This would 
allow the opposition forces inside the country to act, lead to 
an army revolt, and pave the way for the entry of the opposition 
forces from outside. 
  The sources admitted that the stage that will follow this 
remains vague because the opposition parties have not yet agreed 
on the type of regime or the fate of the south, in addition to 
the absence of any party or figure capable of rallying the 
masses or possessing a specific program for taking over 
authority and managing the country in a transitional period. 
  But deputy leader of al-Ummah Party Nasir-al-Din al-Mahdi 
has 
doubts about the likelihood of getting a resolution from the UN 
Security Council setting up safe areas and imposing an embargo 
on Khartoum. He noted that he senses that the British 
Government is hesistant about this matter. 
  Al-Mahdi said that the London meeting was held at the House 
of Lords at the invitation of the House to the opposition to 
come and explain its stands on the current political situation 
in Khartoum, the right to self-determination in the south, the 
conditions of refugees and displaced persons, and other Sudanese 
issues. 
  Speaking to AL-SAFIR from London, al-Mahdi said that "the 
original aim of the meeting was to urge a halt to the war in the 
south, provide the necessary relief and support for the refugees 
and displaced persons, notify Khartoum of the gravity of its 
repressive practices, and deter it by appealing to the 
international community." 
  Al-Mahdi believes that the meeting's call for "setting up 
safe corridors in the war-stricken area, imposing an arms ban on 
the Sudanese Army and an oil embargo and economic sanctions on 
Sudan, defining a military no-fly zone, appointing a resident 
assistant commissioner for human rights in Khartoum, and 
suspending Sudan's membership in international and regional 
organizations" was more an appeal than a call. 
  He admitted that the issue of the right to 
self-determination 
in the south has created controversy and that the opposition has 
failed to reach agreement on it. "No one can say he is 
authorized to raise this issue, not even the southern parties, 
who do not represent all southerners, particularly since most of 
them do not live in the south," he said. 
  Al-Mahdi expects "an escalation of opposition activity 
inside 
Sudan by the Sudanese people as a prologue to deposing the 
government soon after its failure becomes clear. He believes it 
is likely that "the regime's international isolation will 
increase through the imposition of more economic sanctions." 
  He said that the campaign the Sudanese Army is currently 
conducting against the rebels--a campaign that Khartoum denies-- 
"will fail because, at best, government troops will control the 
main roads but not the cities." He believes that this failure 
will create a state of discontent in the Army's ranks and might 
lead to a mutiny. He is convinced that "the internal situation 
will soon explode." 
  Al-Mahdi admitted that the opposition abroad is weak and 
"ineffective," particularly because of the differences among the 
various sectors. "We are trying to draw the attention of the 
opposition abroad to the need to focus on major issues, like 
deposing the regime and drawing up a program for the 
post-al-Bashir era," he said. He added: "But this opposition 
might not be able to do much. The Sudanese are not too wrong 
when they call it the 'hotel opposition.'" 
  He added: "This opposition will continue to be a hotel one 
if 
its internal differences persist. The Sudanese people do not 
expect much of it. They even call on us to stay abroad." 
  The London meeting included Muhammad 'Uthman al-Mirghani, 
the 
leader of the Democratic Unionist Party; 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, the 
secretary general of the al-Ummah party, which is led by 
Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi; 'Izz-al-Din 'Ali 'Amir, a leading cadre in 
the Communist Party representatives of the two rebel wings; Amin 
Makki Madani, the chairman of the Sudanese Human Rights 
Organization; plus 35 Sudanese figures. 
  The conferees differed on the future of the south. 
Representatives of the John Garang-led Sudanese People's 
Liberation Army [SPLA] said: "Here we are divided into 
northerners and southerners on the issue of self-determination." 
  Sources who participated in the meeting say that although 
most of the northern parties may not object in principle to 
granting self-determination for the southerners, they cannot 
risk losing the northerners' support for them by admitting that. 
  The only party that boycotted the London meeting was the 
opposition National Organization for the Independent Sudanese 
Forces. This organization released a statement in London saying 
that "the great interest shown by some Western governments, 
organizations, and media in the war and famine in southern Sudan 
raises many fears and misgivings in a large sector of the 
Sudanese people." 
The statement summarizes these fears, saying that "although 
tragic, the situation in southern Sudan does not differ from 
more tragic situations in numerous regions in Africa and other 
parts of the world that have not received similar attention, not 
to mention that these situations have met with procrastination 
and negligence by the West." 
  The statement adds: "This concern coincides with the 
proposed Western political plans regarding the problem of the 
south and with a call for international intervention to set up 
so-called safe havens in some parts of Sudan. This smacks of a 
plan to partition Sudan and separate the south." 
  The state went on: "There is a clear link between the change 
in the balance of power between the warring sides and the timing 
of the Western governments and organizations raising the issue 
of famine and human rights. This reflects the existence of 
political motives behind this campaign and the West's bias 
toward a certain party." 
  Western countries, led by the United States and Britain, 
indeed began a political and propaganda campaign in recent 
months focusing on the situation in southern Sudan "which has 
not changed since 1983." The campaign has also focused on the 
need to set up safe havens in the south on the pretext of 
insuring the delivery of relief aid to the population. 
  Recent reports from southern Sudan indicate that government 
forces have advanced in the main areas of the south. 
  The statement disputes the right of the parties taking part 
in the London meeting to "speak in the name of the Sudanese 
people" and also denies that these parties' viewpoint is 
representative . 
  Replying to a question about the Sudanese opposition's 
request for an embargo on their country, which the Sudanese 
people would suffer from, the opposition sources which took part 
in the London meeting said "The Sudanese nation already suffers 
from the current situation; an embargo would not increase their 
suffering." 
  The sources rejected any resemblance between the current 
Iraqi situation and the future situation of Sudan if an embargo 
is imposed on it. The sources said that the al-Bashir 
government "has begun to crumble and an embargo will only 
expedite its departure." They expected the embargo not to last 
more than five months, after which the opposition forces would 
be able to enter Khartoum. 
  The sources disclosed that the original plan aimed to set up 
safe havens in the south and proclaim the formation of a 
provisional government in Juba with the objective of toppling 
the al-Bashir government and advancing north after an 
international embargo had been imposed on Khartoum. 
  The sources explained that the recent disagreement between 
Khartoum and a neighboring country allowed for the revision of 
the plan and for deploying opposition forces in these countries 
[plural noun as received] and along the borders with Sudan. 
  Commenting on Egypt's stance on these possibilities, the 
sources said that Cairo will not object to any resolution that 
might be passed by the international community against Sudan, 
noting the Egyptian Government's recent stand that it will not 
intervene in any decision. 
  The sources ruled out the possibility of Cairo objecting to 
the deployment of international and "American" forces in 
southern Sudan. 
  Last week, AL-SAFIR published a report that confirmed that 
the Egyptian Foreign Ministry is opposed to Washington's efforts 
to set up safe havens in the south, noting that it is this 
Egyptian opposition that is blocking such a move. 
  The sources, however, regarded the Egyptian Foreign Ministry 
"as being not concerned in Sudanese affairs." The sources 
stressed that "Sudan has always been regarded in Cairo as the 
responsibility of the Egyptian Intelligence Agency, not the 
Foreign Ministry." 
  As far as self-determination in the south is concerned, the 
sources said that the rebels' call for a referendum on 
separation is an ill-intentioned call because it is not in the 
interests of either the northern or southern parties. 
  The sources said that Garang's wing does not support 
breaking away completely from the north (because of its close 
ties with the north and its leftist tendencies and because its 
ties with Washington are not solid). Meanwhile, the dissident 
wing, led by Riak Mashar, supports that demand "only for the 
sake of one-upsmanship." 
  The sources added that the tribal system in the south does 
not allow it to break away "because this would trigger bloody 
battles among the tribes, which would fight for control." Added 
to this is the absence of an administrative structure or a 
system that could help the south build a "state" or separate 
entity. 
  The sources noted that breaking away would force the 
southern 
authorities to seek the help of "foreign experts" to build their 
state. These "experts" would probably be from the north, 
particularly since the states surrounding the south lack 
suitable cadres, and in addition are mostly French-speaking. 
Arabic is the only common language of the southerners, who 
speak different dialects. 
  Moreover, the sources touched on the issue of oil in the 
south. The discovery of large amounts of oil in the south has 
strengthened some sectors' demand to break away. The 
southerners will need workers and experts to work in that field. 
Although it is possible to seek the help of foreign experts, 
the workers will all be from the south. This means an internal 
migration that could fan tribal disputes. Some tribes will not 
let rivals stay and work in their zone. 
  The sources referred also to the issue of the south's 
"borders" if it breaks away--an issue that is yet to be settled. 
Some demand that these borders be extended to the south of 
Khartoum and accordingly encompass ravaged areas, something the 
northerners will not allow. 
  The sources wondered about the fate of the one million 
refugees who have been living in the north for years. These 
have changed their traditions and lifestyle. "Will they return 
to the south if it breaks away and will they find a place in 
areas totally different now from those they grew up in?" the 
sources asked. 
  The sources noted two additional reasons--both foreign--that 
preclude breaking away. The first has to do with "the OAU 
charter," which views the post-colonial borders in Africa as 
final and unchangeable under any circumstances. The second has 
to do with Sudan's neighboring states, most of whom house many 
tribes. A breakaway would set a precedent encouraging these 
tribes to fight among themselves and demand the right to 
self-determination.

  [Text] TISHRIN comments on the visit of the European Unity 
delegation to Damascus and President Hafiz al-Asad's emphasis, 
during his reception of the delegation, of Syria's support for 
the peace process despite doubts about Israeli seriousness on 
this process. 
  TISHRIN says: Welcoming any European or international effort 
to activate the peace process, we reaffirm that peace is a 
collective interest, and that the conditions and bases of peace 
must be responded to in a positive and constructive spirit. The 
paper notes that Europe has come to realize that peace cannot be 
achieved under the continued Israeli occupation and that partial 
agreements and separate deals cannot lead to lasting peace. 
Europe has also come to realize that no peace is possible under 
the continued Israeli terrorism, massacres, and crimes. 
  TISHRIN says: Undoubtedly, when it denounces all those 
Israeli anti-peace practices, Europe stresses its demands and 
calls for the establishment of a just, comprehensive peace. 
Naturally, these demands and denunciations of Israeli practices 
should be linked to practical stands and measures leading to an 
active and effective European role to help Arabs restore their 
rights and territories and to halt the Israeli massacres. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: Europe should move 
to assume its political responsibilities toward the situation in 
the region, including the issue of a just, comprehensive peace, 
and the enforcement of the resolutions of the international 
legitimacy, which primarily call for Israel's full withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Iraqi opposition 
has monitored new military movements along "the contact line in 
Kurdistan" and warned that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn had in 
a speech on 17 January threatened that "he would bring the Iraqi 
people the good tidings of recovering the north and would spend 
the 'id [feast] in Kurdistan." The United Nations and the UN 
Coordination Commission were informed of these developments and 
the latter said it was watching the situation. 
  A statement issued by the "Iraqi Transmitting Corporation" 
[ITC] [Hay'at al-Irsal al-'Iraqiyah] from its headquarters in 
Salah al-Din in northern Iraq said that the Iraqi Government has 
replaced its armed forces deployed along the contact line in 
Kurdistan in February. The statement, of which AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT received a copy in London, also said: The 10th Armored 
Division of the 1st Corps -- one of the most important divisions 
in the Iraqi Armed Forces -- has withdrawn, taking its armored 
units and advanced T-72 Russian-made tanks, and headed for the 
Tib area in the Maysan Governorate near the Iranian border. Its 
command used as headquarters a building opposite the radio and 
television premises in the town of al-'Amarah. A week later, 
the 1st Mechanized Infantry Division was moved by train to the 
north and took up positions in the area of Makhmur. The 24th 
Armored Brigade, supplied with T-55 tanks, is its only armored 
brigade. 
  The ITC did not give a clear reason for this change in which 
the more advanced tanks withdrew to be replaced by older tanks 
to carry out "the expected attack." The explanation is perhaps 
that the Iraqi regime wants to protect its wing on the Iranian 
border. The ITC also said that the al-'Abid forces of the 
Republican Guard, under the command of Staff Brigadier General 
Salih al-Hajj and his assistant Staff Colonel Nizar Husayn 
al-Husayni, have also moved up to the northern region and taken 
up positions near al-Mawsil dam with brigades deployed in 
Shaykhan, Fulyfilah, and Fa'idah. The changes also included 
withdrawal of the guard units near the contact lines and 
deployment of these units in towns. That was confirmed by 
Peshmerga forces and also by patrols of the Unified Iraqi 
National Congress [UING]. 
  The ITC quoted its correspondent in al-Mawsil as saying 
that, 
during his visit to the town on 23 February, Saddam Husayn met 
with the party leaders and armed forces commanders in the 
northern intelligence service building in the town and told them 
that "he decided to attack" the region of Kurdistan during the 
'Id al-Fitr period. That was accompanied by measures denoting 
aggressive intent. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk was vacated to 
be ready to receive the wounded. The town of Karkuk was 
fortified and on the night of Monday, 28 February and in the 
early hours of Tuesday 1 March some armored units moved toward 
the areas of Bardarash and Shaykhan but stopped short of the 
contact line. 
  That prompted the Peshmerga Ministry in northern Iraq to 
send 
a notification to the UINC, the UN Coordination Commission, and 
the United Nations on 2 March warning of an imminent aggression 
against Kurdistan. 
  The statement added: The Peshmerga forces monitored major 
Iraqi forces movements including armor and heavy artillery in 
the direction of the areas of Fa'idah, Shaykhan, Ba'idrah, 
Bardarash, and Faysh Khabur along the contact line. Our 
correspondent in al-Mawsil says there is much talk in the Iraqi 
Army's officers' circles in the town about the possibility of an 
offensive. As a result, the Dahuk [Peshmerga] command requested 
a meeting with the UN Coordination Commission. 
  The ITC correspondent in Dahuk says that officers of that 
commission went to the Dahuk command on 2 March and met with 
Babakr, the Peshmerga commander in that area, and a number of 
Kurdistan Government officials.

  [Text] Tehran, March, 8, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry 
Tuesday strongly denied a claim by Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak that Iran was involved in an attempt on the life of 
Egyptian Premier, 'Atif Sidqi. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman, Morteza Sarmadi, told IRNA that 
such baseless and false allegations indicated not only the 
"Cairo regime's helplessness and confusion but also the critical 
situation in that country." 
  Sarmadi expressed "deep regret" that a person at the head of 
state level raised "such false claims based on fabrications" 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  In an interview published in the latest issue of Kuwaiti 
daily, AL-QABAS, Mubarak accused Iran of paying dlrs 13,000 to 
an Egyptian terrorist to assassinate the Egyptain prime 
minister.

<F P=106> [Report by Safa Ha'eri: "Wounded and `Scores Of Arrests' </F>
After Demonstration in Tehran"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Eyewitnesses contacted from Paris have said 
that the day before yesterday Iranian security forces attacked a 
demonstration in Tehran staged to protest against the rapid 
deterioration in the economic situation and the spread of 
corruption among the ruling clerics. The eyewitnesses said that 
at least 10 people were wounded in the clash and "scores" 
arrested. 
  Demonstrators assembled at the Ghalu Bandak [as 
transliterated] crossroads in southern Tehran near the bazaar, 
shouting slogans of protest at high prices, the scarcity of food 
supplies, and shortage of medicine. They also denounced 
corruption. The eyewitnesses said "hundreds" took part in the 
demonstration. They said that security forces surrounded the 
demonstration and fired shots in the air. As a result a number 
of demonstrators were wounded, while security forces arrested 
"scores" of them. 
  The value of the Iranian riyal has dropped over the past two 
months by 40 percent, causing the prices of local and imported 
commodities, especially essential ones, to rise at rates 
exceeding 80 percent. The soaring prices provoked a tide of 
demonstrations in a number of Iranian cities. 
  Last Saturday Central Bank Governor Mohammad Hoseyn 'Adeli 
blamed government economic establishments for the high prices. 
Local media services said that car assembly plants belonging to 
the public sector have increased the prices of their products by 
30 percent in less than a month. 
  As is known, the Iranian regime bans media services from 
broadcasting any reports about antiregime demonstrations. It 
also accuses demonstrations of "being hostile to the revolution 
and Islam." And the publication law considers broadcasting such 
reports "collaboration with the enemies" and imposes severe 
punishment for violators.

<F P=106> [Report by Steve Rodan] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Justice Ministry has drafted a plan for the 
removal of all Jews from Hebron, THE JERUSALEM POST has learned, 
but it remains far from certain that the cabinet is ready to 
address this issue, according to sources in the Prime Minister's 
Office. 
  Justice Minister David Liba'i alluded to his plan during a 
tour of Haifa at the end of last week. "We should remove 
radical Jewish elements from the heart of Arab population 
centers," he said. "We must consider how much to invest in 
their safety and how much of a future they have under today's 
changing conditions." 
  The Hebron plan is based on a government assessment that the 
IDF [Israel Defense Forces] can no longer guarantee the safety 
of the 42 families living there. Officials say there are 400 
Jews in the city. 
  "After the events last week, there is a problem ensuring 
their safety," one official said. 
  A senior defense official dismissed the proposal as 
"rubbish," and said it has not been approved or seriously 
discussed. 
  However, a government legal expert said military authorities 
in the territories have the right to order an evacuation. He 
said the easiest way would be to declare Hebron a closed 
military zone. 
  The issue was raised at last week's Wednesday meeting of the 
ministerial security committee. Several ministers called for 
the removal of at least some of the families living in Hebron, 
specifically those in the Bet Hadassah complex. 
  A diplomatic source said Rabin remains the only member in 
the 
security cabinet who opposes the evacuation. PLO sources said 
the removal of Hebron's Jews represents a key condition to the 
resumption of the peace talks. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Evelyn Gordon] </F>
  [Excerpt] Had planned security measures been properly 
implemented, the Hebron massacre could probably have been 
prevented, Acting OC Central Command Maj.-Gen. Dani Yatom told 
the commission of inquiry into the killings yesterday. 
  However, he said, five of the six men -- one soldier, three 
border policemen and one policeman -- who were supposed to be on 
duty inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs were missing. The border 
policemen hadn't been awakened in time -- which had never 
happened before -- while the soldier had been sent to replace 
someone else. 
  Because of the missing forces, Yatom said, no one saw Baruch 
Goldstein enter the Isaac Hall. It is still not known which of 
the three entrances he used. 
  Goldstein's presence during the dawn prayer meeting, 
however, 
was normal, and therefore aroused no comment, he said. 
  Yatom also said the army had not prepared for the 
possibility 
of Jewish terror, because past experience had not led anyone to 
believe this was a problem. 
  Yatom's testimony, part of which was given behind closed 
doors, was the main event of the first day of hearings, though 
several other army officers also testified. 
  Today, the commission will tour the Cave of the Patriarchs, 
and tomorrow it will continue to hear testimony from the Israel 
Defense Forces. 
  The commission will begin hearing Palestinian testimony next 
week, after the end of Ramadan, according to Supreme Court 
President Me'ir Shamgar, who heads the commission. 
  The other commission members are Supreme Court Justice 
Eli'ezer Goldberg, Nazareth District Court Judge 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Zu'bi, Open University President Menahem Ya'ari, and former 
chief of general staff Moshe Levy. 
  Al-Zu'bi repeatedly asked why Jews were allowed to bring 
weapons into the cave, instead of leaving them at the entrance 
-- which, Goldberg pointed out, is the custom at all other 
public places. Though the ammunition must be removed from the 
weapons upon entry, it can be replaced within a second, Shamgar 
noted. 
  "What is the logic of letting someone go among a crowd of 
worshipers with an automatic weapon?" al-Zu'bi demanded. 
  In reply, Yatom stressed that the history of the past years 
has been one of Arab terror against Jews, not Jewish terror 
against Arabs. Therefore, he said, this is where the army 
focused its efforts. 
  "Hundreds of attacks by Arabs against Jews -- that's the 
history of the past few years," Yatom said. "I look at the 
overall picture of Arab attacks against Jews and Jewish attacks 
against Arabs, and on the one side there are hundreds, while on 
the other, a few isolated incidents... We came to the 
conclusion that taking the Jews' weapons away would endanger 
their lives." 
  "A crazy act like this isn't something we expected in light 
of our accumulated experience," he added, noting that even at 
the start of the intifada, when Jewish-Arab relations were much 
worse than they are now, Jews had not committed retaliatory 
murders. 
  There have also been no intelligence warnings of planned 
attacks by Jews, only of planned attacks by Arabs, Yatom said. 
This was repeated by all the other officers interviewed. 
  The idea of a massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs would 
have seemed particularly far-fetched, he added, because there 
were so many places not guarded by the army where it would be 
easier to commit mass murder. Furthermore, there has never been 
a murder attempt there in 27 years, and while there have been 
Jewish-Arab confrontations, these generally occur when both are 
using the Isaac Hall. This was not the case that morning. 
  For all of the above reasons, no one ever raised the 
suggestion that Jews should leave their weapon at the entrance, 
nor has the army ever discussed the possibility of Jewish 
terror, Yatom said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Matti Peled, Israeli Army General, by Mimmo </F>
Candito in Moza Illit; date not given: "`Hebron? 'Arafat Is 
Right, the Massacre was a Conspiracy'" -- first paragraph is LA 
STAMPA introduction] 
  [Text] Moza Illit -- Matti Peled, the general who does not 
want the war, lives on the mountain on the road to Tel Aviv. It 
is a quiet house located among the pine trees; the stone bust of 
Theodor Herzl on a natural balcony overlooks a green slope. 
"Sheket, be good," the general told the dog baring its teeth to 
the visitor. The air is good, there is peace around. Peled is 
70; he was a Haganah "terrorist" and one of the generals during 
the Seven-Day War; but later he became a leader of the 
Israeli-Palestinian Peace Council. He has a nice open face, 
light eyes, and still talks straight, the way the military do. 
He went straight to the heart of the problem that is breaking 
Israel's heart. "'Arafat is right, Goldstein was not an 
isolated madman. The mosque massacre was the result of a 
conspiracy." 
  [Candito] Rabin says it was not and insists that Goldstein 
was the only one to open fire. 
  [Peled] Goldstein opened fire inside the mosque; but others 
were firing outside at the same moment. There were 250 injured, 
and a great deal more than the 30 deaths reported by the 
government. 
  [Candito] Rabin says that "the majority of the families" 
with 
dead relatives in the mosque have been questioned. 
  [Peled] What does "the majority" mean? A great many families 
of Palestinians killed in clashes with the police rush to bury 
them once they have ascertained their death to avoid a request 
for an autopsy. Rabin's police counted 30 bodies for autopsy, 
but perhaps just as many were buried secretly and in a hurry, 
perhaps even more. 
  [Candito] What about a conspiracy? 
  [Peled] Goldstein did not act alone. That is the first 
point. Second: The two policemen whose duty it is to check at 
the entry to the mosque that the settlers' rifles are not loaded 
arrived more than half an hour late that Friday. And this is 
very fishy: Goldstein had been saying for almost two years that 
he wanted to eliminate a lot of Palestinians. Remember also 
that the soldiers guarding the entrance to the mosque live in 
Qiryat Arba', in other words, they live in the same village as 
Goldstein. Finally: Why so much haste to clean away all traces 
of the massacre from the mosque? 
  [Candito] Is there also complicity on the government's part? 
  [Peled] There is a very suspicious combination of lies. In 
any event, governmental connivance with the settlers' extremist 
positions has never been far away: Throughout all these months 
of reflection, the settlers launched Operation Double, which 
consisted of doubling the size of the settlements, as if there 
had never been any accord with the Palestinians. They set up 
tents and built walls, and the government let them do it. 
  [Candito] What should the government have done? 
  [Peled] Wipe out everything, with force, to show one side 
and 
the other, the settlers and the Palestinaians, that it meant 
business. The government made a mistake: It should have 
proceeded as quickly as possible and delivered Gaza and Jericho 
to the Palestinians within six months, and then discuss the rest 
later. 
  [Candito] Whereas? 
  [Peled] Whereas instead, it harped on about the most 
insignificant things, wasting time and losing credibility. Just 
think, when the Israeli delegation turned up to discuss the 
points that Rabin wanted to clarify, it had a 55-page dossier 
that made the Palestinians' eyes boggle. Generals in their 
prime were called upon to discuss methods that a simple customs 
officer could have resolved. 
  [Candito] There is bad faith then? 
  [Peled] In reality, Rabin wants to be freed from the Oslo 
accord and then be able to rewrite it as he pleases. You know 
what the crux of the matter is? It is that the Palestinians see 
the Oslo accord as the first step in a project leading to the 
birth of an independent state, while Rabin sees the Oslo 
signature as a process that will end up with partial 
independence: That is why he combats even the smallest signs of 
sovereignty: the flag, a bank, a currency, the stamp on a 
passport. 
  [Candito] Does he envisage something resembling the old 
Allon 
plan. 
  [Peled] Rabin never talks of this plan but he always thinks 
about it. It is the old project of maintaining all the 
settlements that are considered to be strategic and to cede the 
rest of the Territories to a Jordanian-Palestinian management 
under the sovreignty of King Husayn. And Husayn would not be 
opposed to the idea either. 
  [Candito] We are going back in time. 
  [Peled] Yes, but in the worst possible way. The truth is 
that we should have made peace with the Arabs 25 years ago, when 
we won the Seven-Day War: We were strong, victorious, sure of 
ourselves, while the Arabs had been beaten; they were weak and 
divided. At that time I said: Let us cede the West Bank to the 
Palestinians and give them their independence, then they 
themselves will be our best protection against all the other 
Arabs. I remember I always used to quote Churchill: "In 
victory, magnanimity." Instead we were proud, presumptuous, and 
convinced that we could keep the whole world at bay, and we did 
not give a damn. They called me a traitor. Of course the years 
between 1967 and 1973, that is, until the Yom Kippur war, were 
happy years. I remember that we used to go on carefree picnics 
to Ramallah or to Hebron; then Yom Kippur brought us back to 
reality. 
  [Candito] Is it still too late? 
  [Peled] In politics it is never too late. But of course in 
making that decision we built a very conservative society that 
is different from the one we wanted and could have built. Also, 
the young people are also growing up with this mentality: The 
three years' military service they have to perform when they 
turn 18 forces them to be in a hurry, to want to snatch 
everything immediately: family, university, work. Poor young 
people, what they miss out on is their youth. Take the 
university for example: Young people hate books, which they see 
as a waste of time; all they want is a professor to explain the 
lesson and their notes are all they need. They have no time to 
really study, to understand, to meditate. 
  [Candito] Goldstein is the son of this type of society which 
has no desire to understand. We foreigners see in the 
collective pyschology of Israel a dramatic ethos of complicity 
with religious and nationalistic extremism. 
  [Peled] Certainly. The truth is that the extremists are 
everything that we would have wanted to be: They are the "real 
Jews" and if we are different it is only because of the 
cohabitation problem, not because of an ideological choice. 
They are never condemned on moral or ideological grounds, they 
simply make unrealistic judgements. 
  [Candito] Can ethical complicity also be political 
complicity? 
  [Peled] The resolution that Rabin presented condemning the 
Goldstein case was made to win the votes of the religious 
parties. He made a choice. He could have had the vote of the 
Arab representatives, and he would certainly have been closer to 
the truth of the facts. But he did not want to. 
  [Candito] Where will this lead us? 
  [Peled] Certainly not to a meeting with the Palestinians. 
  [Candito] Is there still hope for peace? 
  [Peled] When I shook 'Arafat's hand 10 years ago everybody 
called me a traitor and they passed a law in the Knesset. Today 
Peres and Rabin are shaking hands. Times are changing, we must 
have the strength to adapt. 
  [Candito] Will Rabin succeed? 
  [Peled] It is difficult to say. I fear that his hopes, his 
vanity will get the better of him. He is already looking to the 
1996 elections, when the prime minister will be elected under 
the new system. He already sees himself as premier in the year 
2000, whereas what we need is a policy of courage, the desperate 
strength of daring.

<F P=106> [Report by Uri Binder, Shefi Gabay, Hemi Shalev, and </F>
Avino'am Bar-Yosef] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Israeli political sources 
yesterday said that Israel will not make any more gestures 
toward the Palestinians unless there is an explicit PLO promise 
that such gestures will lead to a resumption of the talks. It 
has been learned that in such a case, Israel will agree to push 
forward the implementation of some parts of the Gaza-Jericho 
first agreement. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday said that the 
Gaza-Jericho first agreement can be implemented in "half the 
time" stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. Meanwhile, 
political sources yesterday denied reports on contacts aimed at 
organizing a Rabin-'Arafat summit in the near future.

<F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev, Alex Fishman, 'Oded Granot, and </F>
Shefi Gabay] 
  [Excerpt] Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political 
adviser, spent four hours in Cairo yesterday meeting with 
'Arafat and brought back a pessimistic message. Political 
sources in Jerusalem estimated that chances are nil for an 
imminent meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat. 
  Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin spoke on the phone on 
Sunday. 
They discussed the possibility of holding a summit meeting but 
decided there would be no sense in such a meeting if it is not 
certain to result in an agreement. 
  Yesterday's meeting in Cairo was attended by Colonel 'Amos 
Gil'ad, Rabin's aide-de-camp, and Israeli Ambassador to Egypt 
David Sultan. The PLO leader spelled out his conditions for the 
resumption of the negotiations: banning gun-toting settlers 
from moving around towns in the territories, relocating the 
settlers from the heart of Hebron to Qiryat Arba', and 
stationing an international force in the territories. 
  'Arafat surprised his audience with additional demands which 
totally ignore the Cairo agreement. Among other things, he is 
demanding that the size of the autonomous area in Jericho be 
doubled, that Palestinian policemen be stationed at the Jordan 
River bridges, and other demands that gave rise to disputes in 
the past. 
  Neriya gave 'Arafat a message from Rabin saying that Israel 
is willing to significantly accelerate the negotiations and the 
implementation of the agreement once it is signed. 
  'Arafat departed for Tunis after meeting with Neriya. 
"Neriya promised everything would be all right, but he made no 
promises beyond the resolutions passed by the Israeli Government 
in the aftermath of the massacre in Hebron," a senior 
Palestinian source told MA'ARIV last night. 
  Palestinian sources noted that both 'Arafat and Neriya 
voiced 
their apprehension that the peace process might be blown to 
smithereens. "What the settler did in the Cave of the 
Patriarchs was to massacre the peace process," 'Arafat said. He 
asked that Israel investigate the role of the Israel Defense 
Forces in the event. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign </F>
Ministry, by Pierre Beylau and Henri Bainvol; place and date not 
given: "Extremist Settlers Must Be Neutralized"] 
  [Text] [Savir] This appalling massacre will not be without 
consequences. From a religious and moral point of view, much 
time will be needed for passions to recede and wounds to heal. 
From a political viewpoint, the only way to overcome this 
tragedy is to implement the Oslo agreement. I understand the 
Palestinians' situation. They are reconsidering their position, 
and then we need to hold talks away from the media to make sure 
the agreement comes into force more or less within the agreed 
upon time frame. The Palestinians understand that the Hebron 
killing was an isolated act which the whole of Israeli society 
condemns very strongly. 
  [LE POINT] This raises the problem of Jewish settlements in 
Gaza and the West Bank... 
  [Savir] One cannot solve the issue of settlements at this 
point. It will be dealt with as part of the negotiations on the 
final status of Gaza and the West Bank, which will start two 
years after the entry into force of the interim autonomy 
agreement. Of course, outside the scope of the negotiations, 
Israel is free to decide where its own interest lies. I do not 
believe that the time has come to send a signal that might spark 
delusions. The Oslo approach is a gradual one. We steered 
clear of anything related to the most contentious issue: 
sovereignty. For decisions to be made on the future of the 
settlements, we need a large consensus among Israel's 
population. Racist, violent, and extremist settlers must be 
neutralized. And they will be. 
  [LE POINT] The Palestinians seem intent on securing new 
concessions from Israel: disarming the settlers; bringing an 
international force into the occupied territories... 
  [Savir] We must stick to the agreement. If we call that 
into question, the whole process will collapse. 'Arafat knows 
perfectly well that we listen to him when he is being 
reasonable. The agreement does mention a temporary 
international presence. Therefore this is an issue we can 
discuss. The PLO is also confronted with a formidable 
challenge: to control the Hamas movement, which has been doing 
all it can to sabotage the peace process. Hamas will likely be 
the biggest obstacle to peace. 
  [LE POINT] Do you still believe in peace? 
  [Savir] It will be a difficult peace, fraught with violence 
and tragedy. If the Palestinians manage to establish open and 
effective economic institutions, a multiparty political system, 
and a reliable leadership, things will work out. Something very 
important was born in Oslo. Everybody fears it may now be 
destroyed. The true secret of the Oslo success consisted in the 
creation of common interests. We must go all the way with this 
process.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Noam Federman, spokesperson for </F>
the "extremist `Kakh'" movement, by Lorenzo Cremonesi "just over 
two months ago" in Beit Hadassah [as published]: "I am a Settler 
Fighting Against Everybody"] 
  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- "Do you know why the secret services 
do not manage to get us? Because we have now learned our 
lesson, we know their tricks, the way they operate. We receive 
our military training in the United States, our radio sets are 
tuned to those of the police, we now know how to hide, we have 
learned the rules of underground operations. Just think that 
almost every night one of our armed units manages to penetrate 
into Hebron's old town without ever being detected by the army, 
which nevertheless has orders not to let us through." 
  Kakh spokesperson Noam Federman' words (Kakh is the Israeli 
extremist movement to which Baruch Goldstein -- the author of 
the Hebron massacre -- belonged) sounded almost prophetic. They 
were uttered in the course of an interview held with our 
newspaper just over two months ago in Beit Hadassah, one of the 
eight small Israeli settlements in the Arab heartland of Hebron. 
  "A war to the last drop of blood is being fought between us 
and the Arabs. There is no other alternative: It is either us 
or them. However, we are very much concerned that Rabin's 
government is apparently prepared to sell out our country's 
heartland in exchange for a mock peace. He is hoping that we 
will abandon Hebron, and therefore he is not providing us with 
adequate protection against Arab terrorism. This is why we 
decided that it was high time that we acted for ourselves. We 
will defend ourselves by all means available. We will attack 
the Arabs and terrorize them. We will force them to leave." 
Federman asserted this fearlessly, without trying to hide his 
intentions behind words. 
  Reading again those notes is almost like reading the 
announcement of a future massacre. Today Federman is in hiding. 
In fact, since 28 February the police have been looking for 
him, as well as three other activists, all of whom are accused 
of belonging to a movement which, with the massacre nine days 
ago, has now proved that it is ready to implement the racist 
theory of "great Israel's ethnic purity" by means of armed 
terrorism. 
  One of them, 33-year old Baruch Marzel, who, following the 
assassination of the organization's founder, Rabbi Meir Kahane, 
four years ago in New York, is now considered Kakh's senior 
leader, has given rise to a spate of polemics after the national 
TV network broadcast an interview in which he appeared disguised 
in a motorcyclist's helmet and a large black coat. 
  Many are asking: "Why is it that reporters are allowed to 
speak to people wanted by the police, but the police are unable 
to arrest wanted people?" [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] yesterday 
threatened suicide attacks on several settlements if they aren't 
evacuated by March 15. 
  "The settlers of Qiryat Arba', Gush Qatif, Qedumim, Teqoa', 
and Ari'el must leave their settlements by March 15," Hamas's 
'Izz-al- Din al-Qassam military wing said in a leaflet. 
  "If they don't, we will not let them rest in their 
settlements or feel safe on the roads to their settlements." 
  It also warned that "the leaders of Israel will pay for 
their 
crimes sooner or later," and scoffed at the army's ability to 
prevent the attacks. 
  The leaflet, titled "The Settlers Will Pay with Their Blood 
for the Massacre," described a five-stage plan of attack. 
  "With each step we will make the Israeli people and settlers 
cry in blood for their dead, and let them know that our blood is 
not cheaper than theirs," the leaflet stated. "We have chosen 
our targets and our living martyrs have been instructed to carry 
out the suicide operations."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yisra'el Har'el, chairman of the Council of </F>
Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip: "The 
Price of Madness"] 
  [Text] At Baruch Goldstein's funeral this week in Qiryat 
Arba', his friends felt a need to praise him to journalists. 
  They said his act was a mitzvah meant to save the people of 
Israel, the Land of Israel, and Jewish settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza. 
  The massacre in Hebron was not for the sake of Eretz Yisrael 
or the settlers. But it was against them, against all that is 
sacred and precious to us, that 118 bullets were fired by Barukh 
Goldstein. 
  This Purim "gift" -- our vocabulary does not have a more 
sarcastic term to apply to the massacre -- was delivered not 
just to the dead, the wounded, and their families. Goldstein 
sent his gift to the Jewish residents of Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza, as well as Israel proper. Here are some of the components: 
  -- This "mitzvah" will bring a bloodbath in its wake, whose 
main victims will likely be pure and innocent civilians like 
those on the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday, and those of Qiryat 
Arba' and other settlements and in the rest of Eretz Yisrael who 
will be murdered in revenge. And in the current atmosphere of 
incitement and breastbeating at the massacre, the general public 
has been conditioned to show understanding for future murderers. 
As a result, the settlers, not the killers, will be held 
responsible for the casualties. 
  -- The government, forced to redouble its efforts "to save" 
the collapsing Oslo agreement, will make further concessions. 
These could eventually lead to the attainment of a long-held 
goal of Yasir 'Arafat and Meretz adherents: the dismantling of 
the settlements in stages, with Jewish Hebron, over which so 
much blood was spilled, likely to be the first victim. 
  -- The release of some 1,000 Palestinian terrorists, which 
is like handing them and potential murderers a license to 
continue slaying Jews. 
  -- The Oslo process, in all its gravity, succeeded in easing 
pressure from foreign countries, especially the U.S. Now, to 
accelerate the peace process, the Americans have summoned the 
Arabs and Israel to Washington and will present their 
longstanding plan: retreat to the 1949 borders, including 
Jerusalem. 
  -- Resentment is felt toward Qiryat Arba' and the other 
settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza by a not insignificant 
portion of Israeli society, including many whose basic instinct 
is national but whose Jewish soul absolutely cannot acquiesce in 
such massacres. 
  This public tells itself that if this is the price we must 
pay occasionally for maintaining settlements (and the memory of 
the Jewish underground also comes to mind) then the inescpable 
conclusion is that the two peoples must be separated. That 
includes the evacuation of Qiryat Arba' and Hebron of their 
Jews, which enjoys the support of a majority in the government. 
  -- Before Israel's establishment, when the disturbances ran 
riots in the land, Jews were forced to travel in convoys; now, 
60 years later, we are being forced to return to the travel 
procedures of a besieged society -- and to do so in Qiryat 
Arba', which bears the flag of Israeli pride and fought 
faithfully through the years for Israel's honor. 
  For years, those hating the settlements, including champions 
of law and justice, sought to impose emergency regulations on 
the Jewish residents of these strongholds, thus equating their 
standing with that of the Arabs. 
  Now, in addition to all the moral, security, settlement, and 
political "achievements" of the massacre, emergency regulations 
have been imposed. For it is not difficult to mobilize support 
from a conformist attorney-general, the self-righteous media, 
and academia's legalists. That backing is provided with relish. 
  And those are just some of the political, security, 
psychological, and existential results to be visited on us 
because of this ghastly massacre. 
  "He was a righteous man," assert those who knew him well; 
perhaps, but the moment he trained his gun at the backs of the 
men kneeling in prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs, he ceased 
being righteous and became a mass murderer. There should be no 
mourning for him. 
  Several people, including some halakhic authorities, saw the 
killing as a mitzvah. If that's the case, I have no part of 
such mitzvot. To the best of my understanding and knowledge, 
the thrust of Judaism and the great majority of the observant 
settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza reject this interpretation. 
  In a deed which aroused passions almost 26 years ago, Rabbi 
Moshe Levinger and a group of pioneers laid the foundation for 
the renewal of Jewish settlement in Hebron and subsequently in 
the rest of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. 
  In the same period, a child was growing up in New York named 
Baruch Goldstein who probably didn't know about the historic act 
of Rabbi Levinger. He later chose to become a lethal agent in 
demolishing the foundations of the Jewish community in Hebron 
and elsewhere in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza. 
  And the founding father of the settlement movement does not 
see that his handiwork is sinking in the sea. In a trance of 
self-destruction, and in the name of Israel's honor, he refuses 
to draw the necessary conclusions from the terrible act and 
continues to preach his message.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ze'ev Binyamin Begin: "Talking With Hamas"] </F>
  [Text] Shim'on Peres has been treading a tortuous road from 
the "malodorous maneuver" of Jerusalem 1990 to the malodorous 
maneuvers of Oslo 1993 and Davos 1994. Two weeks ago he proudly 
recounted how he overcame disagreements with 'Arafat in Davos. 
"You were once a terrorist," Mr. Peres told Mr. 'Arafat, "but 
today you are an ex-terrorist." The exterminator of vermin 
sprinkled some holy water on "the chairman," and peace descended 
on Israel. 
  So much for sycophancy and its wages. In an interview with 
THE NEW YORK TIMES last week, 'Arafat accused Israel of 
conducting an "evil plan" by giving out weapons to Arabs in the 
Gaza District in a bid to bring about a civil war. 
"Procrastination in the negotiations will lead to anarchy," the 
bearded righteous man warned, thus rewarding Peres' holy water 
with a shower of spittle. The PLO leader is preparing himself an 
irrefutable alibi. He says that even after he is given control 
of Gaza and Jericho (first) terror will continue from there 
("anarchy"), and he preemptively holds Israel responsible 
because it is "giving out" weapons. This ignoble murderer is 
being defended by the Israeli Government, and cabinet ministers 
say he should not be defeated too often. 
  This is not a new excuse. "If we do not talk with the PLO, 
we will have to talk with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]." 
On the eve of Purim, the following verse from the Book of 
Esther can aptly be applied to the issue of terror: "Before 
whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will 
not prevail against him but will surely fall before him." The 
moment one begins giving in to terror one will go on 
capitulating to it, and whoever decided to talk to the PLO is 
actually conducting a dialogue with Hamas. 
  Pieces of evidence accumulated recently show that the 
Israeli 
Government is giving in to the demands of Hamas via the PLO. 
Two weeks ago in Cairo the foreign minister signed an Israeli 
undertaking to grant amnesty to terrorists, and Nabil Sha'th 
hastened to explain that the PLO cannot let Hamas members, "the 
enemies of peace," rot in prison. Of course, all of them will 
be released within months so as to uphold 'Arafat's status. 
  At the PLO's demand, the prime minister promised two weeks 
ago in the Cairo agreement not to arrest Hamas murderers who 
stand to be released from jail at the border crossings "only" on 
the basis of suspicions that they are planning terror attacks. 
They will cross the Allenby Bridge with their amnesty papers so 
as to uphold 'Arafat's status. At the PLO's demand, it was 
decided in the Cairo talks that membership in Hamas alone will 
not be sufficient grounds for an Israeli demand to question (or 
even interrogate) a person wishing to enter Gaza and Jericho 
from either Egypt or Jordan. Hamas members will freely roam 
through the border terminals so as to uphold 'Arafat's status. 
In a meeting with high school students last week, the chief of 
staff asserted that the murders committed by Hamas serve the 
PLO's objectives well and complement them. 
  The prime minister does not have a plan. He gets dragged 
after events, trudges to meetings with "the chairman," suggests 
that he sweat it out, makes his foreign minister sweat it out, 
and signs -- after perfunctory cringing -- the documents 
presented to him by his notoriously tireless adversary. In yet 
another of his well-known witticisms, Mr. Rabin announced last 
week that it is his job to say "no" to the striking university 
lecturers, just as it is his job to say "no" to the PLO. 
However, in recent months he has been neglecting the latter "so 
as to uphold 'Arafat's status." 
  After the signing of the Oslo agreement, the prime minister 
warned 'Arafat not to use the title "president of Palestine," 
and last week he declared that any attempt by the PLO to run its 
affairs from Jerusalem would be a gross violation of the 
agreement. It did not take long for 'Arafat to retaliate. He 
published an advertisement in the East Jerusalem paper AL-NAHAR 
in which he announced the opening of the Palestinian Center for 
Statistics in...Jerusalem, and signed it with his three titles: 
"Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine, chairman 
of the PLO Executive Committee, and chairman of the National 
Palestinian Authority Council." 
  Mr. Rabin has kept mum so as to uphold the status of his 
friend Yasir, in light of the pressures by Hamas. 
  The Israeli Government's policy has had a simple and 
destructive result: The PLO has become a lever with which Hamas 
is pushing Rabin's government to make concessions with regard to 
the rights of the Jews in their land and the minimal demands for 
their security. What follows is ceding the chances of peace.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Shmu'el Schnitzer: "The Dream of Banishing </F>
Jews from the City of Our Patriarchs"] 
  [Text] In the negotiations on the Oslo agreement, the 
government firmly insisted that no Jewish settlement should be 
uprooted during the interim period and, what is more, that the 
Israeli Government will be responsible for the lives and safety 
of the settlers in their homes and while driving on the roads. 
  It now transpires that the government firmly insisted on its 
position in the negotiations, but it did not really support the 
position on which it insisted. An increasing number of 
ministers have been expressing themselves in favor of uprooting 
settlements -- perhaps just Netzarim, but maybe the entire Qatif 
Bloc. Or at least Qiryat Arba'. Or the heart of Hebron. The 
name of any minister and deputy minister who respects himself is 
being noted down these days on one of two fashionable lists: 
wants to uproot some settlements and neighborhoods, or insists 
(still) on his opposition to the uprooting of settlements. 
  With a society as transparent as ours, in which every view 
is 
immediately aired on one of many radio or television talk shows, 
there can be no doubt that the PLO has been accurately taking 
note of those ministers and politicians who likewise think that 
the Oslo agreement was a mistake and that now is the time to 
wrest better terms from Israel. It is now clear to all that the 
entire PLO and half the cabinet want to uproot settlements. Can 
anybody in Tunisia not seize this one-time opportunity to 
squeeze concessions out of the hesitant Israeli Government? 
  Anyway, with our active assistance, the PLO scored a big 
advantage in the negotiations. We are prepared to pursue the 
talks under any condition or without any condition. The PLO, on 
the other hand, must be seduced and rewarded every step of the 
way. While the PLO names its price for returning to the 
negotiations, we have no price. We will even go for free. And, 
if the price quoted by the PLO is that we agree to do something 
that quite a few in our midst are eager to do in any event, why 
should we fight it and our instincts and not give it what it 
wants? 
  Of course, we know how dangerous it is to reopen a signed 
agreement and to agree to amend a key clause. After all, we 
were the ones who complained that the PLO tends to renege on 
promises and to define a final agreement as an Israeli draft 
proposal. 
  In this case, however, the instinct is so strong and the 
Israeli-PLO affinity is so absolute that we (or at least some of 
us) believe that we really must heed the adversary's demands, 
because those demands are merely the fulfillment of a dream that 
we share. 
  I must confess that I do not quite understand the motives of 
people for whom the uprooting of a Jewish settlement is not a 
source of pain and anguish but rather of satisfaction. I find 
the bizarre ideal of making a town in Eretz Yisra'el off-limits 
to Jewish residents rather pathological. But I realize that it 
is perceived as a kind of collective punishment of a large 
group, as a sort of sanction against Gush Emunim and masses of 
settlers who have for months been depicted as enemies of the 
people and as an obstacle to the peace process. 
  They are an obstacle because the presence of Jews in the 
Palestinian self-rule is perceived as a kind of provocation and 
can in no way be compared with the presence of hundreds of 
thousands of Arabs in the Jewish state. 
  I think one must admit that if the idea is collective 
punishment, it will be very effective if it is expressed in the 
uprooting of a settlement or a neighborhood. The pain will be 
acute and genuine, because these people in Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza are really attached to their land and truly believe in the 
right of Jews to settle anywhere in any country in the world, 
and all the more so in Eretz Yisra'el. 
  They will feel the hurt in their hearts and their faith, and 
being banished from their homes will be an unbearable pain for 
them. All this, however, does not make collective punishment 
fair or just. It is an elementary rule that a person is 
responsible for his own actions and cannot be held criminally 
responsible for the actions of his fellow man within a group or 
a nation. It is utterly inconceivable to banish people not 
because of something they did but because of something done by 
someone else who can no longer be reached by the arm of justice. 
  Collective punishment does not require incriminating 
evidence 
or mitigating circumstances. It convicts a person because he is 
a Jew living in a city with a Muslim majority, a settler in the 
midst of a community hungry for withdrawal, a simple man whose 
neighbors are both evil and foolish. His indictment and his 
sentence were both preordained in his identity card. Our 
forefather Abraham rebelled against collective punishment when 
he argued with the Lord about the fate of sinning Sodom, in 
which a handful of righteous men still remained. "Wilt thou 
indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?" he asked. Moses 
and Aaron similarly implored the Lord not to punish Korah and 
his congregation: "Shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry 
with all the congregation?" 
  But all this belongs to the ethics of Hebrew law, and Hebrew 
law is not all that popular in Israel of 1994. Now we are 
concerned with calculations: 48 families in Hebron (or 28 in 
Netzarim) and how many soldiers will be needed to protect them 
(as if the Israeli Army had any other mission than to protect 
Jews!) 
  In sum: Collective punishment is wrong and usually 
ineffective. It is totally absurd when it does not come to serve 
law and justice but rather political needs or even emotional 
blackmail (I have a hard time finding a more accurate 
description of what the Palestinians are hoping to gain from the 
tragedy in Hebron). 
  It seems to me that even people who totally identify with 
the 
PLO's argument that the presence of Jews in a Palestinian city 
is an obstacle to peace should, like me, hesitate somewhat 
before deciding that a certain Jew and the members of his 
household should be banished from Hebron not because of some sin 
they committed but because they are Jews and, as such, are not 
wanted there, or because they are settlers and, "as is known," 
every settler is a potential murderer. This sounds like a 
complete repeal of all the principles of law and justice, like 
an untenable injustice, and like trampling on every Jewish right 
in Eretz Yisra'el. Nonetheless, that is exactly what those 
ministers and Knesset members who openly side with the PLO's 
demand to revise the Oslo agreement are demanding, and the first 
step they envision is complementing the results of the 1929 
pogrom in Hebron by expelling the Jews from homes that were 
looted then and which have only recently come under Jewish 
ownership again. 
  Jews were expelled from Spain, France, Germany, and England, 
from countries, provinces, and cities, but never by a Jewish 
regime and definitely not from the land of the Jews. It is a 
monstrous, unconscionable, and ungodly thought. 
  The nightmare of a Jewish government banishing Jews from a 
city in Eretz Yisra'el, of a Jewish army using such a punishment 
against Jewish citizens, is seen by some people as something 
desirable, as a goal that should be voiced out loud and promoted. 
  I ask myself: How did they get into such a blind alley of 
obtuseness and self-hate? How did they become so blind that 
they do not understand that one of the first victims of their 
impetuous demand will be the very same peace agreement on which 
they are pinning all their hopes for their future and ours?

  [Text] A North Korean military team left Iran a few days 
ago. The team, led by the Air Force commander and made up of 28 
military and nuclear experts, arrived in Tehran in the second 
week of last month. The team's mission was to put the final 
touches to the Nodong-2 missile, which the Koreans are 
developing for Tehran. This is a developed Scud version with a 
range of 900 km. U.S. information revealed that Tehran was 
planning to field test this missile, but decided to postpone 
that to some other time in order to avoid a confrontation with 
Washington, which has for months now been intensifying its spy 
satellite surveillance of the Iranian territories. This is the 
second postponement after last September's for the same reasons. 
However, the North Korean team returned with new agreements 
with Tehran to intensify bilateral military and nuclear 
cooperation. The U.S. intelligence estimates say that more than 
800 North Korean military experts and officers are in Iran. 
Meanwhile, more than 53 Iranian military men are working at the 
Iranian military attache's section in Pyongyang.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Georgina </F>
Higueras in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] Tunis -- Under the enormous brightly colored 
photograph of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem of which he 
dreams, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat looked somber and exhausted 
when he received the EL PAIS special correspondent at his 
headquarters in Tunis. "I am paying too high a price for my 
firm commitment to the peace process," he asserted. 
  The shooting of around 50 Palestinians by a Jewish settler 
in 
Hebron on 25 February was like a hammer blow for the veteran 
leader, weary of bloodshed and tired of seeking a peace which 
persistently evades him. Caught between Israeli intransigence 
and the growing opposition to his conduct in his own ranks, 
'Arafat has gone on the defensive and has ceased to exude that 
tremendous confidence which used to be sensed around him and 
which made him more a hero than a leader of the PLO. The legend 
is beginning to show his feet of clay, and to some extent he is 
aware of this. Yet perhaps at the same time he increases his 
human stature in this way. This eventful interview has suffered 
the consequences of the instability surrounding the Palestinian 
leader. When I asked him about the division in the PLO, 
reflected by the fact that when he convened the Executive 
Committee, only eight of its 18 members attended, 'Arafat went 
wild and tried to call off the interview. Fortunately, it was 
resumed later. 
  When I asked him about the disagreements within the PLO, the 
64-year old Yasir 'Arafat went wild and demanded that I tell him 
who had given me that information, which, however, he did not 
deny. He said that this was not an interview but an 
investigation, called off the appointment, and asked his 
bodyguard to remove the tape from my recorder. Marwan Kanafani, 
the man in charge of his appointments, and another adviser who 
was present, were as astounded as I. When I was outside the 
room, they asked me to return today, but I told them that it was 
better for them to try to calm him down and for us to continue 
the interview. Half an hour later, 'Arafat received me again, 
but when he learned that Marwan had asked the bodyguard to 
return the tape to me, he ordered him to take it away from me 
again. Later, when we said goodbye, I recovered it, but erased. 
Hence the first part of the interview is a reconstruction. 
  [Higueras] Have the talks with Israel been broken off or 
postponed? 
  ['Arafat] We are awaiting the UN Security Council 
resolution. 
  [Higueras] But do you believe right now that the dialogue 
has been broken off? 
  ['Arafat] We must wait and see. 
  [Higueras] Will this time be used to secure greater 
consensus on the peace process? 
  ['Arafat] The peace process has lost all its credibility, 
and this is a result not only of the Hebron massacre but also of 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's tricks. He promised me 
when we signed the Cairo accord (12 December last) that we would 
meet within 10 days in order to set under way the process of 
Israel's military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank. 
Eighty days have elapsed, and I am still waiting, but now 
nobody -- neither Palestinians, nor Israelis, nor Americans, nor 
Europeans -- believes in the peace process. Moreover, the Army 
is ultimately responsible for the massacre. 
  [Higueras] Do you hold Rabin responsible as Army chief? 
  ['Arafat] No, certain units. 
  [Higueras] 'Abbas Zaki, a member of the Standing Committee 
of Fatah -- the PLO faction which you head -- stated in Amman 
Monday that the truce in armed actions against Israel has been 
broken. Is this true? 
  ['Arafat] He is speaking for himself. 
  [Higueras] Do you mean that the cease-fire to which you 
committed yourself, although you did not officially declare it 
after the Washington accord, will continue to be observed? 
  ['Arafat] I am saying that this is not Fatah. This is a 
democracy. Everybody can say what he wishes, but they have 
nobody behind them. 
  [Higueras] You convened the PLO Executive Committee Sunday, 
but only eight out of the 18 members attended. 
  ['Arafat] Where did you get that information? Who told you 
that? What do you know of the PLO? Tell me who told you that. 
You are conducting an investigation -- not an interview. We 
have finished. ['Arafat ends] 
  When I came in again, I tried the interview from another 
approach. 'Arafat was calm but even more distant than he seemed 
to me at the outset. The questions did not matter to him. As 
in a refrain, he blamed Rabin again and again for blocking the 
peace process, and stressed that he had been waiting for him for 
80 days. 
  [Higueras] The Arab-Israeli talks began in Madrid and, among 
other places, continued in Granada. Will the final agreement be 
signed in Toledo? 
  ['Arafat] What must be clear to everybody is that we are 
working for peace -- not just in Madrid. Before and afterward, 
we have also accepted various peace initiatives, although the 
Israelis were putting us in a very bad position and offering us 
nothing. Rabin promised to return in 10 days -- and not only to 
me but also to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak -- and he did 
not do so. We have been very flexible, but what was the price? 
This horrible massacre. 
  [Higueras] But if an agreement is finally reached, do you, 
as Rabin says, want it to be signed in Toledo? 
  ['Arafat] The Israelis say one thing and do another. Six 
months have elapsed since the Washington accord (13 September 
1993), and none of what was agreed has been put into practice. 
They are not serious about building peace. What they have 
offered following the Hebron massacre is nothing; much less than 
what is required. When Rabin telephoned me to offer me his 
condolences, I explained to him that the Army is involved, 
because entering the mosque with weapons is not allowed, and 
Israeli troops are the one who guard the mosque. 
  [Higueras] Do you believe that there are many Baruch 
Goldsteins in Israel? 
  ['Arafat] It is not only I who say so; even some members of 
Rabin's government do. We all know that some of those fanatics 
are real time bombs. 
  [Higueras] Do you believe that the Israeli Government is 
strong enough to disarm the settlers? 
  ['Arafat] The decision is theirs -- not mine. If they have 
an opposition, so do we, but we are ready to implement what we 
have signed and they must do so too, especially now when the 
majority of the Israelis are opposed to what has happened. Now 
they have a very good opportunity to adopt strong and specific 
measures in order to prevent such a thing from happening again. 
  [Higueras] Who do you believe is in the more difficult 
position -- Rabin or yourself? 
  ['Arafat] I am. 
  [Higueras] Why? 
  ['Arafat] It is clear and simple; because I am struggling 
for peace, and so far peace has not been achieved. Rabin is 
maneuvering, not working for peace, and that is why it is I who 
am paying the price of peace. I am paying too high a price. 
The latest is that of the massacre. Nobody can imagine what is 
happening, and it is we who are paying. 
  [Higueras] Since the massacre, the Palestinians have 
increased their criticisms of you for committing yourself to 
this peace process. 
  ['Arafat] And they are right. None of what was agreed has 
been put into practice, but it is the Israelis' fault. The 
peace process has lost its credibility worldwide. 
  [Higueras] Do you feel isolated? 
  ['Arafat] This is not the first bad situation that I have 
had to face. Before Hebron, there were many other massacres, 
such as the Jerusalem mosque massacre and the Sabra and Shatila 
massacre. There have been other massacres, and all of them 
committed by Israel. 
  [Higueras] But do you feel isolated? 
  ['Arafat] I have already answered you. 
  [Higueras] You are demanding international protection for 
the Palestinians. Would it be enough for the Security Council 
to vote in favor of sending unarmed blue helmets to Gaza and 
Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] Unarmed civilian observers will not resolve the 
problem. How will they protect themselves? Who will protect 
them? We already have UN observers. What we want is something 
to protect our people. 
  [Higueras] When do you believe you will set foot in Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] After what has happened, there is no answer. 
  [Higueras] Are you pessimistic or optimistic? 
  ['Arafat] I am realistic. I work with facts and realities. 
['Arafat ends] 
  The interview had ended, and with the tape recorder off, 
'Arafat asked me again about the open secret of who attended 
Sunday's and Monday's meeting. He stated that the Executive 
Committee no longer has 18 members, because five have resigned, 
but he did not explain that, since their number has not been 
formally changed, the quorum is still nine. Nor did he mention 
that four of those who did not attend the meeting live in Tunis. 
He stated that he convened not the Executive Committee but the 
PLO leadership, comprising the members of that committee and 
another 10 leaders of the occupied territories, and perhaps it 
was in his frenzy to make me understand the facts that he let it 
slip that "over 13 were sitting at this very table."

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO president Yasir 'Arafat by Christophe </F>
Boltanski, Marc Kravetz, Patrick Sabatier; place and date not 
given: "The Peace Process Following the Hebron Massacre"-- 
interview copyrighted by LIBERATION/World Media] 
  [LE SOIR] The UN Security Council is at present debating 
the problems caused by the Hebron massacre. What do you expect 
from them? 
  ['Arafat] First of all, I regret to say that the armed 
settler who carried out this horrible massacre was supported and 
shielded by Israeli Army units. We can prove our claims and I 
spoke quite frankly about this to Rabin when he telephoned me. 
First, we expect the Security Council to take specific measures 
to guarantee the safety of our people in the Occupied 
Territories. This has happened before: The massacre of 
Rishon-le-Zion [as published] or at the Esplanade of Mosques (in 
Jerusalem). Over the last five days we have also witnessed 
another massacre, throughout the occupied territories, from 
Bethlehem to Gaza, including Nablus and Jenin, leaving 21 dead 
and 240 wounded. In Hebron, the total dead is 65 plus 265 
injured. This killing cannot have been the work of one 
individual. The army is fully implicated in this conspiracy. 
Perhaps not all the army, but at least the Hebron units. How 
could an armed settler have accompanied a military patrol under 
curfew and then attacked a mosque? We therefore need 
international protection. That is why we called for a meeting 
of the Security Council and the disarming of the settlers. 
  [LE SOIR] What kind of protection are you expecting from the 
United Nations? 
  ['Arafat] It appears we are facing the same kind of problem 
as in Algeria, before independence. These settlers, supported 
by elements within the army, are a new Secret Army Organization 
[OAS]. We must therefore restore confidence to our people who 
have lost all faith in the peace process. The events in Hebron 
have had an impact throughout the region. 
<H5>  Restoring Confidence To Our People </H5>
  [LE SOIR] In exactly what way is the Israeli Army 
responsible? 
  ['Arafat] This mosque has been surrounded by the army since 
the occupation of the West Bank in 1967. The Israelis have 
confiscated part of the site which they have converted into a 
synagogue. They control all the entrances, all the approaches. 
I am entitled to ask how this gang of 10 or 12 men, well armed, 
entered this mosque during dawn prayers, during the month of 
Ramadan, and in the presence of Israeli soldiers. How? Some of 
our people were gunned down outside the mosque, while trying to 
flee, by soldiers on guard duty. I spoke with our people for 
half an hour at the Hebron Ahli hospital to find out what had 
happened. I was able to speak to a worshipper who accompanied 
one of the wounded. During our telephone conversation one 
person cried: Abu 'Ammar, they are attacking us. I heard the 
shots myself. I described this incident in detail to Mr. Rabin 
when he contacted me to offer his condolences. 
  [LE SOIR] What did he say? 
  ['Arafat] He said it was just a lone gunman. I replied that 
this was not true and I gave him all the information. He said 
he would investigate, but that I was making a mountain out of a 
molehill. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you believe the Israeli Government is 
implicated 
in the mosque attack? 
  ['Arafat] No, I only accuse certain units within the Israeli 
Army. But the government must assume its responsibilities. Who 
supplied these settlers with arms? How is it they have been 
able to participate in joint army patrols? The forces of 
occupation bear full responsibility. 
  [LE SOIR] What form should this international protection 
take? Observers? 
  ['Arafat] No, we favor, as does France, the dispatch of a 
multinational force, as the Israelis do not want the United 
Nations. 
  [LE SOIR] Would this force consist of soldiers or civilians? 
  ['Arafat] Civilians? To do what? They cannot oppose armed 
men. In Angola they are not civilians, and nor are they 
civilians in Yugoslavia, Cambodia or southern Lebanon. Why 
should the Palestinians be treated differently? 
  [LE SOIR] Do you think you will get satisfaction from the UN 
Security Council? 
  ['Arafat] We will do everything in our power to ensure the 
protection of our people. Those who delay the adoption of these 
measures or who oppose them will bear the responsibility. 
  [LE SOIR] You have dispatched emissaries to many different 
destinations. 
  ['Arafat] Nabil Sha'th has gone to Cairo, Abu Lutf (real 
name 
Faruq Qaddumi) has gone to Damascus and Amman. I was in Algeria 
on Monday. We have sent other emissaries to Morocco. I 
telephoned King Fahd on Monday evening. We are remaining in 
constant contact with all the Arab countries. I have called for 
an emergency meeting of the Jerusalem committee under the aegis 
of King Hassan II of Morocco, of the presidential office of the 
Islamic Conference Organization, and of the movement of the 
nonaligned countries, the committee of nine is meeting today at 
the United Nations. I have also just met with a special envoy 
from Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the Greek foreign 
minister representing the European Union. 

<H5>    We Need Time </H5>
  [LE SOIR] Would a Security Council resolution protecting the 
population allow the peace talks to resume? 
  ['Arafat] I have also mentioned the disarming of Israeli 
settlers. By the terms of the accord we concluded, internal 
security will be guaranteed by us or, in those places where it 
is present, by the Israeli Army. There will be no other 
authority. Today, we are in the presence of a third force: The 
settlers. Who could accept that! And I tell you that all the 
Arabs support us. The Lebanese, the Syrians, and the Jordanians 
have also suspended the negotiations. 
  [LE SOIR] Has the Hebron massacre changed the nature of the 
peace process? 
  ['Arafat] It has totally changed the climate, but not the 
basis of this process. We were on the verge of peace. But 
instead of that we have witnessed a massacre. And the Israeli 
Army, rather than trying to restore calm, has aggravated the 
situation by claiming another 21 victims. 
  [LE SOIR] Do you have any other specific demands regarding 
this settlers? 
  ['Arafat] Rabin himself has spoken of this fanatical group, 
Kakh. Do you know that it has its own settlement? Are these 
men going to be allowed to train, with their weapons, in this 
settlement and commit their crimes? It was not me, but Rabin 
who was the first to speak of these political settlements run by 
these organizations. 
  [LE SOIR] So you want them to be dismantled? 
  ['Arafat] In one way or another, yes. These settlements, 
these fanatical groups, these settlers are time bombs waiting to 
go off. We are not asking for the moon. But we neither want to 
kill peace nor be killed by it. 
  [LE SOIR] You have accepted Bill Clinton's invitation to 
continue negotiations in Washington. At least in principle. 
Has he offered you guarantees? 
  ['Arafat] First of all, we appreciate this initiative. We 
applaud the speed of the American response. But we need time. 
Especially given the present anger in the occupied territories. 
The peace process has lost its credibility. We need concrete 
actions in order to reassure our people that they can obtain 
something different from the negotiations than massacres and 
more oppression. 
  [LE SOIR] In present circumstances, can the framework of the 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement be upheld? 
  ['Arafat] Since we signed this accord, the Israelis have 
never stopped their intrigues and procrastination. This text 
was due to be implemented on 13 December. That is more than 80 
days ago. And still no result. Rabin assured me that there 
would be no more than a 10-day delay. Who is to blame? The 
prime minister repeats that there is no sacred date. On the 
subject of an international presence, the Israelis reply that 
there is no sacred demand. One day they will tell us that there 
is no sacred accord. And now there has been this massacre. A 
horrible massacre in a sacred place, in the middle of Ramadan. 
Can you imagine the impact that it can have on Muslims? 
<H5>  The Ball Is in the Israeli Court </H5>
  [LE SOIR] Will the timetable be respected? 
  ['Arafat] (angrily) You must ask them that question. We have 
spent months discussing the security of the settlers! And now 
we discover that it is the settlers who are the criminals. They 
are protecting criminals! 
  [LE SOIR] Have you also asked for security measures for the 
Palestinians? 
  ['Arafat] (silence) Yes. They were even bargaining on the 
number of police. Should it be 5,000 or 6,000 ... It is 
becoming clear today that it is our people who need protection. 
Not the armed settlers. Some Israeli ministers have also 
called for the dismantling of the Kirjath-Arba [as published] 
settlement. I am not the only one. 
  [LE SOIR] Has your opinion of Rabin changed following the 
Hebron massacre? 
  ['Arafat] I will wait to see what he actually does before I 
answer that question. I am a pragmatic man. It is not personal 
feelings which concern me, but the facts. Our people are 
appealing to us today. How can we guarantee their security? 
  [LE SOIR] If Bill Clinton personally invites you to 
Washington, will you accept? 
  ['Arafat] Nobody can refuse President Clinton. If he invites 
me, I will pay him a visit. But I am not going to pose for the 
cameras again. The Americans give the Israelis everything they 
want. Since we signed the agreement, they have provided money, 
the best computers, planes, loan guarantees. They have opened 
doors for them in Africa, in Asia, everywhere. When we ask for 
what is owing to us, the United States tells us to be patient 
and to wait until a final agreement is signed. The Greek 
Government is the only one to have offered us anything. 
  [LE SOIR] So what do you hope to get from the United States? 
  ['Arafat] I repeat, let us wait and see. The peace process 
is vital for everybody, not just for us. 
  [LE SOIR] In September, you proposed a courageous peace. Can 
this wish still come true? 
  ['Arafat] The ball is in the Israeli court. Do the Israelis 
have a de Gaulle, or even a de Klerk? De Gaulle wiped out the 
OAS. It takes two to tango.

<F P=106> [Article by JLV/RHR: "Armali-Harel: Mideast Talks Must </F>
Continue;" as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 3 Mar (BELGA) -- "We demand the 
establishment of an international force and the disarmament of 
the settlers to ensure the protection of the Palestinian people 
in the Occupied Territories." This was stated by PLO 
representative in Brussels Shawqi Armali during a meeting with 
Israeli Ambassador to Belgium Victo Har'el on Thursday monrning. 
The meeting was organized by the Belgium-Israel section of the 
Interparliamentary Union. 
  Mr. Har'el asked the Palestinians "to overcome the grief 
caused by the Hebron massacre and to not allow this tragedy to 
interfere with the progress made in the peace negotiations." 
"If we stop the negotiating process now, we will play into the 
hands of the extremists, of all those who want to maintain a war 
situation in the territories," Har'el added. 
  Before discussing the measures taken Friday by the Rabin 
government (disarming the extremists, setting up an 
investigating commission, and releasing approximately 1,000 
Palestinian prisoners), the Israeli ambassador declared that 
"disarming the settlers is not conceivable because they must 
have the means to defend themselves." 
  Mr. Armali agreed that "the grief must be overcome and the 
repetition of such a massacre must be avoided. The measures 
taken by Rabin are not sufficient, however. The settlers must 
be disarmed." 
  Har'el and Armali warned that disenchantment is taking hold 
among the Israeli and Palestinian peoples in view of the delay 
in implementing the Oslo and Washington agreements in the 
territories. "Public opinion on both sides is awaiting tangible 
signs of these agreements. People should see a change," Har'el 
added. 
  "Oslo was only the beginning of a long process. The 
negotiations may yet be long and difficult, but peace is at the 
end of the tunnel," the Israeli ambassador concluded.

  [Text] The Iraqi opposition in Salah-al-Din has monitored 
new military movements on the contact line between the forces of 
the ruling regime in Baghdad and Iraqi Kurdistan. The 
opposition stressed that in a speech on 17 January, tyrant 
Saddam threatened that he would restore the north and 
(?celebrate) the 'Id [words indistinct] the United Nations 
[words indistinct] that it is monitoring the situation. 
  A statement by the Iraqi Transmission Authority [hay'at 
al-irsal al-'iraqiyah] in Salah-al-Din said the regime replaced 
its Armed Forces on the contact line in February. The 10th 
Armored Division pulled out of the sector of the 1st Army Corps 
in Makhmur to the Governorate of al-'Amarah near the border with 
Iran. The 1st Automatic Infantry Division was transferred from 
Mosul to Makhmur. 
  An Austrian correspondent in northern Iraq has reported that 
forces of tyrant Saddam Husayn have almost finished their 
preparations for a new military attack against the Kurdish 
areas. Alan George, a correspondent for the daily DER STANDARD, 
said he saw a military buildup and armored forces belonging to 
Saddam Husayn's regime on the contact line with the Kurdish 
cities. They were moving and in a state of preparedness for 
military action. He said an attack by Saddam's forces against 
the Kurds would constitute a direct challenge to the forces 
entrusted to provide international protection for the Kurds 
there. The Austrian paper said Saddam, revealing his hostile 
intentions, hinted to his senior military commanders during a 
meeting with them in Mosul on 23 February that he intends to 
[words indistinct] during March and plans [words indistinct]. 
It is known that several Western countries, including the 
United States and Britain, have warned Iraq's tyrant against 
committing a new foolish act after monitoring Saddam's forces' 
movements toward the Kurdish areas.

  [Text] New York, 8 Mar (INA)--Iraq has informed the UN 
General Secretariat that the U.S. U-2 spy aircraft has violated 
Iraq's airspace on the pretext of conducting air surveys for the 
UN Special Commission. 
  In a letter UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali received 
yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said this 
aircraft violated Iraq's airspace on 26 January and on 7, 15, 25 
February, flying over vast Iraqi areas after which it left the 
Iraqi airspace for its base in Saudi Arabia. He explained that 
these four violations raised to 196 the number of violations by 
this aircraft. 
  Al-Sahhaf added: While condemning and denouncing these 
unjustified violations of our airspace, we stress the constant 
Iraqi position that this aircraft is used for purposes other 
than those specified by the Security Council and that its 
activity harms Iraq's sovereignty and security. 
  Al-Sahhaf continued: We emphasize Iraq's constant request 
for employing Iraqi means in the Special Commission's work 
instead of foreign means in order to exclude the possibility of 
using the latter for purposes that harm Iraq's sovereignty and 
security. Your correct assessment of this aircraft's nature and 
real task was published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on 16 November 
1993, in which you said: I do not want a James Bond spy aircraft 
at the United Nations. This assessment requires that the United 
Nations should immediately reconsider the use of this aircraft 
in violating Iraq's airspace in a way that conflicts with the UN 
Charter's objectives and principles which call for respecting 
the equality and sovereignty of all UN member states.

  [Text] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA)--As'ad Bayyud al-Tamimi, 
leader of the Islamic Jihad-Bayt al-Maqdis movement, has 
stressed that Iraq is, God willing, strengthened by Islam, the 
Koran, and the faithful leadership. 
  In a cable he sent to President Saddam Husayn on the 
occasion 
of holy Ramadan, al-Tamimi beseeched God Almighty to grant the 
Muslims victory at his excellency's hands and to defeat the 
infidels who are colluding against the Muslim nation so that 
Iraq can devote its total attention to the cause of Palestine, 
which is now being sold at the U.S. and world slave market. 
  Al-Tamimi added that the polytheists were defeated in the 
two 
Qadisiyahs and will, God Almighty willing, soon be defeated and 
the flag of Allahu Akbar [God is great] will fly over the heads 
of the soldiers marching on Jerusalem, as they marched in 
Ramadan to the battle of Badr and to Mecca, the birthplace of 
Islam.

  [Excerpt] Baghdad, 6 Mar (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan has stressed that Iraqis from all faiths stood united to 
defend Iraq in the glorious Saddam al-Qadisiyah battle and the 
immortal Mother of Battles epic and offered sacrifices and 
martyrs on the path of victory. 
  During a meeting with a delegation of Eastern Catholic 
patriarchs, Ramadan said that the continued blockade against 
Iraq and the starving of its people is considered an aggression 
against humanity because it is immoral and illegal. He said 
that the world public is now aware of the methods of falsehood 
and allegations used by the United States and its allies to 
realize their evil intentions. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that the methods of injustice 
and 
aggression will not continue and that the principles of justice, 
right, and humanity will triumph. He stressed that, through 
their reconstruction drive and determination, the Iraqis have 
set an example of steadfastness and determination in their 
defense of their sovereignty and existence. 
  He praised the visit of the Eastern Catholic patriarchs, 
which they made under the circumstances of the unjust blockade.

  [Text] Dubai, March 8 (AFP)--Rival northern and southern 
troops have reinforced their positions across Yemen, bracing for 
renewed fighting. 
  The build-up came despite growing opposition in the main 
cities to any spread of violence, the YEMEN TIMES reported in 
its latest edition seen here. 
  The English-language weekly published two maps showing where 
units loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner, and 
his southern rival, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, were being 
swelled by reinforcements. 
  These moves could lead "at any time" to a "large-scale 
conflict", since there had been no political settlement to the 
seven-month-old crisis, the paper warned. 
  North and South Yemen united in May 1990, but a crisis 
erupted last August when al-Bid refused to take up his duties in 
the northern capital Sanaa, demanding political, economic and 
security reforms. 
  The armies of the two former states, which each have about 
50,000 men, were never merged after unification. 
  According to the YEMEN TIMES maps, rival units are facing 
each others in 'Amran, Ma'rib, Dhamar and Harib, in the northern 
part of the country. 
  Clashes in the past two weeks in Abyan province have already 
killed more than 20 people and left dozens of others wounded, 
sources have said. 
  It was here a few dozen kilometers (miles) east of Aden that 
the largest build-up appeared to be taking place despite a 
reconciliation agreement signed by Salih and al-Bid on February 
20 in Amman, Jordan, the paper said. 
  In the south troops were preparing for action in Qataba, 
Mukayras and near the port city of Aden, the former South Yemeni 
capital. 
  The regular army units on each side were also counting on 
tribal support if a large scale war erupted. 
  President Salih has already received the backing of the 
powerful Hashed tribal confederation, led by the Muslim 
fundamentalist Speaker of the Parliament Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar. 
  And Vice-President al-Bid has deployed militiamen around 
Aden, and is being backed by the Bakil tribe, Hashid's rival. 
  Witnesses have also reported seeing military equipment being 
regularly flown into Sanaa and Aden from abroad. The exact 
nature and origin of those equipment is still unknown. 
  The recent build-up in war preparations prompted Sanaa 
university lecturers to launch a "popular resistance" movement 
last week to make the "politicians listen to reason." 
  Hundreds of people in Sanaa, Ta'iz and Hudaydah, in the 
north, and Aden, in the south, have signed a petition opposing 
violence and demanding that the Amman agreement be implemented. 
  And organisers say that it has won the support of some 
military officers from both sides. 
  Several Yemeni leaders, including al-Bid, have also called 
for a "civil disobedience" campaign to resolve the crisis 
peacefully.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>
  [Text] Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, Yemeni 
deputy prime minister, has called on President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid to be rational and to 
give utmost priority to the interests of the homeland and 
nation. He urged them to stop making mistakes in order to save 
Yemen from the bad consequences of letting things continue as 
they are. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR, Abu-Shawarib said 
that after all the efforts that have been made, he believes 
there are people working for separation. Based on this belief, 
he said that he had resigned from the dialogue committee because 
he does not want to suffer the condemnation of history, because 
all those who contribute to the foiling of unity will be 
condemned by history. He said Yemen will endure, and the faith 
of Yemenis in their unity will continue, and individuals will be 
gone, sooner or later. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expressed pessimism about 
Yemen's foreseeable future, because the president and his 
deputy, and the People's Congress Party and the Yemeni Socialist 
party, continue making mistakes visible to local, regional, and 
international public opinion. Each party is trying to show it 
is eager to maintain unity, but this is not the real situation, 
he and his colleagues in the dialogue committee have concluded. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expected something to happen 
in the near future unless reason prevails. He said it is a 
matter of time. If recriminations continue, they will lead to a 
military confrontation, and Yemeni unity will be the scapegoat. 
  He prayed to God to save Yemen from the plots of its enemies 
inside and outside, especially since the situation has reached 
the point in which reform is useless unless things are returned 
to normalcy, and living consciences give priority to Yemen and 
the Yemeni interest. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib highly valued the role played 
by His Majesty King Husayn toward the signing of the document of 
pledge and accord, and his eagerness to maintain the Yemeni's 
unity and fraternal spirit, and his desire to do all he can to 
preserve Yemeni unity. At the same time, he expressed 
appreciation of the Omani role in this field, and hoped that 
other Arab parties will play good roles that serve the interests 
of Yemen and the Yemenis. 
  Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib hoped that the Yemeni 
president and his deputy will return to the right path and do 
what is for the good of Yemen in order to save their country 
from dangers known only to God.

<F P=106> [Report by Amin Muhammad Amin in Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] Yemeni Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya 
al-Mutawakkil has stated that the al-Jihad Organization and the 
Afghan Arabs who returned from Afghanistan are the ones behind 
the recent assassinations in Yemen, not the General People's 
Congress Party, which participates in the ruling coalition in 
Yemen. 
  Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed in an interview with AL-AHRAM 
that arresting the masterminds and criminals of the organized 
assassinations in Yemen is the joint responsibility of the 
General People's Congress and the Socialist Party. 
  He added that the majority of these terrorists are based in 
the southern governorates such as Abyan, Hadhramaut, and 
Shabwah, as well as in the northern governorates such as Sanaa 
and the areas of Khawlan and Marid [place name as published]. 
  He pointed out that those involved in the assassinations are 
well known but all have not been arrested because it is not easy 
to do so. He clarified that the terrorists are currently hiding 
out in mountainous areas where huge military forces are needed 
to track them down. 
  On the Pledge and Accord document, he said: The document 
came to express the aspirations of the people to find a system 
that guarantees the maintenance of unity and paves the way for 
local government. He pointed out that the expectation that the 
crisis would be resolved immediately after the document was 
signed in Amman was not accurate since it is too serious and 
complicated to be resolved by a mere signature. 
  He explained that the conflicts started after united Yemen 
was established. Because of everyone's joy over unity, they 
forgot to take needed measures, such as merging the armed and 
security forces and institutions and finding a unified course 
the state should follow. The differences emerged very clearly 
after parliamentary elections were held. These elections 
revealed the loyalty of the parties in the north and south to 
their old bodies, foremost of which is the Army. This deepened 
the rift between the two sides. 
  He said: What is happening in the Yemeni arena does not 
represent the end of the road because Yemen is currently going 
through a state of upheaval. 
  Al-Mutawwakil expected the military skirmishes between Abyan 
and Mudiyah to stop next week and the forces to withdraw to 
their original positions. 
  On the surprise postponement of the cabinet meeting that was 
to convene in Aden by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, 
he clarified that a request was made to postpone the meeting so 
that its success could be guaranteed, especially since the 
agenda proposed by the prime minister is not enough. He added 
that he will convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting after the 
'Id al-Fitr. On the demands made by the Socialist Party to 
remove the military camps from the cities, he said: The pledge 
document has specified certain steps for doing so, however, the 
current atmosphere does not allow this demand to be met. 
Therefore, we need to hold talks and agree over a joint method 
to implement all articles of the pledge document gradually. 
  Regarding the participation of new mediators, including Arab 
and other countries, to implement the document, he said: There 
is no justification for new mediation because the People's 
Congress is in constant and direct contact with the leaders of 
the Socialist Party. He ruled out that developments in the 
Yemeni arena will lead to restoring the split between the north 
and the south. He said it is difficult to accuse foreign powers 
of having interfered in what is happening. However, unity does 
have some enemies and there are some sides that wish to redivide 
Yemen into two parts. 
  Regarding the recent problem of foreigners being kidnapped, 
he said it is new to Yemeni society but is part of the crisis 
the country is going through. This crisis has given tribes the 
chance to carry out kidnappings to blackmail the state. 
  Brigadier General Yahya al-Mutawakkil affirmed that the 
security forces have taken all necessary measures to guarantee 
that such incidents are not repeated.

  [Excerpts] The Chamber of Deputies held a plenary session 
today. [passage omitted] 
  Deputy 'Ali 'Ammar assailed the U.S. ambassador's 
interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. He said: Before 
the two massacres were committed [Hebron killings and Lebanese 
church explosion], it was expected that something would happen 
in Lebanon, as shown by the U.S. ambassador's statements. The 
ambassador's interference goes beyond all international norms 
and constitutes intervention in Lebanese internal affairs like 
between a victim and a murderer. He also provokes certain agents 
and symbols to foment sedition. Deputy 'Ammar added: It is 
time that the pertinent authorities stopped responding to the 
U.S. intentions that seek to cause sedition among the Lebanese 
people. 
  He asked the Chamber of Deputies to adopt a stand denouncing 
the U.S. envoy's behavior. [passage omitted] 
  [Beirut Voice of Lebanon in Arabic at 1235 GMT on 8 March 
adds: 
"Deputy 'Ali 'Ammar called U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley the 
ambassador of filth [safir al-danas]. He described his movements 
as suspicious and as going beyond diplomatic limits. He said 
that the ambassador equates victims and criminals."]

<F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, March 9 (AFP)--New tactics and weapons are 
the secret to the Iranian-backed Hizballah's success in 
inflicting heavier losses on Israeli and allied militiamen in 
south Lebanon while suffering fewer casualties. 
  A month after killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding 
five, Hizballah guerrillas on Monday [7 March] launched a series 
of bomb attacks on the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA), 
killing 10 militiamen and wounding 12. 
  A senior intelligence officer was among those killed, but 
Hizballah reported no casualties on its side. 
  "Monday's operations were specifically aimed at eliminating 
Israel's main intelligence agents," Shaykh Nabil Qawuq who is 
among those in charge of Hizballah operations in south Lebanon, 
told AFP on Tuesday. 
  "They are part of a series of operations to sow chaos among 
SLA ranks," he said, adding that more than 100 SLA militiamen 
had deserted over the past year. 
  Military experts and sources close to the Shiite Moslem 
fundamentalists said Hizballah's operations in recent months 
were more professional and homed in on specific Israeli or SLA 
targets to avoid retaliation against civilians. 
  The guerrillas were also using more sophisticated weapons. 
  Their arsenal now includes Russian-made Sagger anti-tank 
rockets known for their precision, which are increasingly being 
used against moving targets, a western military source said. 
  Hizballah has had "very good results" with the rockets, said 
the source, who declined to be named. 
  An SLA official said that Hizballah guerrillas were also 
using a new type of roadside bomb that "is shaped like rocks and 
painted in earthy colours." 
  He said the bombs were Iranian-made or upgraded by Iran and 
that they were capable of jamming Israeli radars. Hizballah 
also uses Katyusha rockets and mortars. 
  Sources close to the fundamentalists have said the new 
tactics evolved two months ago with the arrival in Lebanon of a 
new team of Iranian Revolutionary Guards to oversee and 
coordinate the anti- Israeli operations. 
  They include a new head for the Revolutionary Guards and an 
Iranian official known by his first name only, 'Abbas, who is 
said to be in charge of Hizballah's military operations, the 
sources said. 
  Around 200 Revolutionary Guards, clerics and social workers 
are based in Lebanon's eastern al-Biqa' Valley, where they were 
first deployed following Israel's 1982 invasion. 
  Hizballah has meanwhile transferred its military positions 
out of the al-Biqa' city of Ba'labakk to areas closer to the 
border with Syria and switched its activities in the region to 
social work and construction. 
  Fundamentalist sources said these steps were part of a 
campaign by Hizballah to improve its domestic image after 
winning eight parliamentary seats in the 1992 elections. 
  "They are also focusing more and more on helping their 
supporters to set up private businesses as part of an effort to 
forge a new image for the movement," a reliable source said. 
  "Hizballah has become more diplomatic since the 1992 
elections. They no longer terrorize people," the source added. 
  Hizballah leader Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah said last month his 
organisation was "not only a military movement. We have popular 
roots everywhere."

  [Text] Konduz Province has been cleared of the existence of 
Dostam's infamous and corrupt militia. As a result of the 
heroic operation of the infidel-crushing fighters of Konduz 
Province and with the participation of mojahedin from the 
provinces of Takhar and Badakhshan, Konduz Province was cleared 
of the filth of Dostum-Babrak-Golboddin's militia by 1700 today. 
  The mojahedin operation, which started yesterday, continued 
its advance toward the city of Konduz from three directions: an 
operation from the direction of Khanabad and the asphalted road 
under the command of Qari Rahmatollah, from the direction of the 
airport under the command of Commander Amir Mohammad, and from 
the direction of Bala Hesar under the command of Mir Alam along 
with Commander 'Abdol, Commander Sher Mohammad, Commander Mirza 
Naseri, and with the cooperation of the mojahedin of the 
provinces of Takhar and Badakhshan. By 1700 today they achieved 
complete conquest of the airport of Konduz, the division 
[headquarters] of Bala Hesar, the city of Konduz, the district 
of Chardara, and Sher Khan Bandar. The operation ended 
successfully with the active and all-out cooperation of the 
people of Konduz, who had suffered enough of the oppression of 
Dostam's thieving and looting militia over the past few days, 
and with the cooperation of mojahedin and commanders of Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party]. [passage indistinct]

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Bagram, Afghanistan, March 8 (AFP) -- Mojahedin 
forces loyal to the Afghan president have captured a strategic 
fort from Uzbek rivals in an attack on the northern capital 
Konduz, former defence minister Ahmed Shah Mas'ud said Tuesday 
[8 March]. 
  "The state forces have seized the Konduz Bala Hesar (fort) 
and key points around the airport," the military strongman of 
president Borhanoddin Rabbani said in an interview. 
  Speaking at Bagram airbase, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) 
north of Kabul, a relaxed and confident Mas'ud said that the 
Uzbek militia of ex-communist General Abdul Rashid Dostam had 
pulled all their heavy weapons back from the Konduz airport 
under pressure from mojahedin fighters Tuesday. 
  He said before the state forces launched their offensive, 
armed locals in Konduz had already started to attack individuals 
of the Dostam militia because of the "Uzbek excesses" when they 
captured the city about a week ago. 
  "They committed every sin known to man," said Mas'ud, 
recounting rape, robbery, kidnapping and murder. 
  Mas'ud, who received continual radio updates on the fighting 
in Konduz, said more than 50 Uzbek troops had been killed and 
another 150 taken prisoner so far, while an unknown number of 
tanks had been captured. He gave no figures for casualties 
among pro-Rabbani forces. 
  With the aid of a hand-drawn sketch-map, Mas'ud took pains 
to 
describe how Dostam got the upper hand in the Konduz fighting 
earlier. 
  He said state mojahedin had repulsed Dostam's attacks 
successfully, confining the Uzbeks to the west of the Konduz 
River until Hezb-e-Eslami inside the city staged an internal 
uprising and attacked them from the rear, after which they were 
obliged to flee. 
  Afterwards, these same Hezb-e-Eslami faction guerrillas, who 
are loyal to Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, turned against 
Dostam when the Uzbeks tried to disarm them after Hezb protests 
about looting in the city. 
  Mas'ud said the only Hezb-e-Eslami fighters in Konduz still 
loyal to Dostam "are ethnic Turkomans who are based in the 
mountains to the west, and who are outsiders like Dostam's 
Uzbeks." 
  "In general the majority of Uzbeks in Konduz and Takhar 
provinces are loyal to the state, only the Turkomans side with 
Dostam," claimed Mas'ud. 
  Admitting that the neighbouring town of Khanabad, 25 
kilometres to the east, had also been captured by joint 
Dostam-Hezb forces and occupied for two days, he said it was 
re-captured by his troops after three days. 
  He said advancing westwards from Khanabad, the pro-Rabbani 
mojahedin captured two key posts Monday -- one on the road to 
Konduz and the other near the airbase. 
  "It wasn't the plan to attack the airbase. We didn't have a 
strong enough force but the enemy pulled back so fast our forces 
made a hot pursuit," Mas'ud explained. 
  Tuesday's successful capture of Bala Hesar, once the 
fortress 
of a 19th Century Uzbek ruler in Konduz, has cut Dostam off from 
his base at Sher Khan Bandar on the Amu Darya River, he said. 
  Furthermore, in an operation east of Sher Khan Bandar along 
this river, which forms the international boundary with the 
former Soviet Union, three commanders had cleaned up pockets of 
pro-Dostam Uzbek supporters who had "created problems for the 
local people," Mas'ud said. 
  "The border is now secure between Emam Sahib and 
Dasht-i-Archi," Mas'ud declared.

  [Text] New Delhi has told Washington that its recent 
statements on the situation in Kashmir tend to encourage 
Pakistan in abetting terrorism across the border. The minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, said in the 
Rajya Sabha today that the references to Kashmir by responsible 
U.S. officials lack balance and proper perspective. Answering a 
spate of supplementaries on the reported shift in the U.S. 
policy, he said the government has taken due note of the fact 
and is dealing with it accordingly. We are protesting where it 
is necessary, he said. And Mr. Bhatia added that in diplomacy, 
there are many ways to explain one's point and convey resentment 
where it is called for. Mr. Bhatia said (?the government) has 
told the Clinton administration that Kashmir is an integral part 
of India, and we will not brook any interference in our internal 
affairs. Observing that there seems to be no finality in the 
U.S. position, the minister said New Delhi is having a 
continuous dialogue with Washington to make it understand our 
position. Mr. Bhatia pointed out that Indo-U.S. relations are 
multifaceted in nature, and despite differences on certain 
issues, there are numerous constructive and mutually beneficial 
aspects. Human rights, nuclear nonproliferation, and Kashmir are 
some of the issues on which there are differences of opinion. 
Asked about the forthcoming visit of the U.S. assistant 
secretary of state to New Delhi, Ms. Robin Raphel, he said 
whomsoever she meets she would be told categorically that her 
comments have damaged the Indo-Pak relations and encourage 
Pakistani militancy. Reiterating that there is no question of 
third country mediation on Kashmir, the minister said it is not 
a disputed territory. He agreed to table the documents 
exchanged between India and Pakistan at the recent foreign 
secretary-level talks. Replying to the main question, the 
minister said Islamabad's clandestine nuclear weapons program 
has been confirmed time and again. Mr. Bhatia made it clear 
that New Delhi neither has nor intends to acquire weapons of 
mass destruction. He said the real danger, therefore, is of 
nuclear adventurism on the part of Pakistan. The minister 
regretted that Washington has not done much to prevent Pakistan 
from acquiring and retaining weapons of mass destruction.

  [Text] The prime minister asserted in Parliament today that 
the export of terrorism by Pakistan to Kashmir will be put down 
and nothing can come in the way of protecting India's 
territorial integrity. 
  Replying to the debate in both houses of Parliament on the 
motion of thanks to the president's address, he termed 
Islamabad's raising of human rights issue in Kashmir in Geneva 
as totally uncalled for. The prime minister has said that 
Pakistan has no locus standi in the state other than that of an 
aggressor. The motion was later adopted by both the houses 
after rejecting all opposition amendments, including one by 
division in Rajya Sabha. In his hour-long reply marked by 
repeated thumping of desks by treasury benches, the prime 
minister referred to the resolution on Kashmir passed by 
Parliament and said it fully reflected the determination of the 
nation on the Kashmir issue. 
  Referring to the U.S. pronouncements recently, the prime 
minister said though there is improvement in Indo-U.S. relations 
in the economic and other spheres, the understanding has to be 
enhanced in certain areas. He said the home minister's 
statement in Parliament makes the government's position clear. 
  The prime minister announced that India and China are likely 
to achieve a breakthrough in resolving confrontation in areas 
along the Line of Actual Control. 
  The prime minister rejected the idea of carving out new 
states as it will open a Pandora's box. He, however, said 
measures have to be taken to remove the interstate economic 
disparities. Referring to the northeast, the prime minister said 
peace has been restored in the region except Manipur, where 
intratribal clashes have taken place. There also the situation 
has improved after the imposition of president's rule, he said. 
  On the Dunkel proposal, the prime minister reiterated that 
India has nothing to lose but much to gain as the farmers will 
be able to sell their produce in the international market and 
get more remunerative prices. 
  On Ayodhya, Mr. Rao said action will be initiated after the 
Supreme Court gives its ruling. He promised to take the house 
into confidence while taking action on this matter. 
  Expressing optimism on the country's economy, Mr. Rao 
declared that the government will increase investment in rural 
development by three folds. More than 1 lakh crore rupees will 
be spent for rural uplift in the next seven years. Stressing 
the need to increase the power supply, the prime minister said 
massive investment is being made in the sector. Rejecting the 
charges that foreign investment is coming only in the consumer 
sector, the prime minister said about 90 percent of foreign 
investment is in the core sector. He also reiterated the 
government's resolve to earmark 6 percent of the national income 
for education. He said the schemes announced by the government 
for women and unemployed youth have gathered momentum.

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri: "China and India Reject Iran's Call </F>
for New Alliance"] 
  [Text] London -- China and India have both rejected an 
Iranian call for a new Asian alliance against "U.S. hegemony 
over the world." 
  Both, however, have expressed willingness to purchase 
unspecified quantities of national gas from Iran and try to 
reschedule Iran's debts to them. 
  The Iranian proposal first came from President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani at the beginning of PRC Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's three-day visit which ended 
yesterday. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then made the same proposal to 
Indian Foreign Minister Dinesh Singh, who is currently in Tehran 
for economic talks. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's plan calls for the creation of an axis 
through which Iran, Pakistan, India, the PRC, and Japan would 
form a bloc opposed to U.S. hegemony. 
  The Iranian president told his Chinese and Indian guests 
that 
Washington's current "provocations" against Japan on trade 
matters should persuade Japan to join such a grouping. 
  A senior Pakistani diplomat said yesterday that the Iranian 
idea is nothing more than "a far from serious illusion." He 
added that Hashemi-Rafsanjani last year suggested a similar plan 
when Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Tehran. 
  A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that 
his 
government had not received any Iranian official proposal for 
the formation of an Asian defense pact. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani had hoped to persuade Qichen and Singh to 
meet with their Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati with a 
view to issuing a joint statement about the creation of the "new 
axis," but the two ministers refused to meet with one another. 
A highly-placed Iranian diplomat said that "the initiative did 
not evoke the required reactions, but we made good progress on 
the Kashmir issue." After meeting with Singh, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani dropped his traditional calls for the full 
implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. Intead he 
supported New Delhi's call for negotiations between India and 
Pakistan to resolve the issue "in the interest of the people of 
Kashmir and the entire region." 
  Iran is known to owe the PRC and India $2 billion and hopes 
the two countries will agree to reschedule the debts along the 
same lines as the agreement Tehran concluded with Bonn. 
  Iranian and Western diplomatic sources confirmed yesterday 
that both Qian Qichen and Singh explained to the Iranian leaders 
that their countries will not cooperate with Iran militarily 
unless Iran pays what it owes for past arms purchases.

  [Text] Tehran, March 8 (AFP)--Sunni Muslim militants 
planted two bombs which exploded in the town hall and Shiite 
Muslim mosque of the Iranian town of Zahedan, the daily KAYHAN 
said Tuesday. 
  The paper did not say if the March 2 attack in the 
Sunni-majority town of southeast Iran close to the border with 
Pakistan caused any casualties or damage. 
  But it said security forces had arrested several members of 
the group "Sahab army" who had admitted responsibility for the 
attacks. 
  It was the first time that the fundamentalist Wahhabi group, 
which has close links to Saudi Arabia and is based in Pakistan, 
has been publicly blamed by Iranian authorities for an attack in 
Iran. 
  Numerous attacks on the Shiite community in Pakistan have 
been attributed to the group. 
  Zahedan with 350,000 inhabitants is one of the main Sunni 
towns in Iran, a country where 80 percent of the population is 
Shiite. 
  At least six people were killed in violent clashes between 
Sunni demonstrators and security forces in Zahedan last month 
during a protest against the destruction of a Sunni mosque in 
northeast Iran, reliable sources said. 
  The Iranian media has since January warned of the risk of 
attacks in the region by Wahhabi fundamentalists, charging that 
they were backed by Iran's main armed opposition movement, the 
Mojahedin-e Khalq.

  [Text] Pakistan's efforts to internationalize the Kashmir 
issue has suffered a setback. Two of its close neighbors Iran 
and China have advised Islamabad to seek a dialogue with New 
Delhi to solve the issue which they have said is a bilateral 
matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent recording] 
Iranian and Chinese backing of India's position on Kashmir came 
during the visit of [Indian] External Affairs Minister [Dinest 
Singh] to Teheran. The Iranian president, 'Ali Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani, told Mr. Dinesh Singh that Teheran wants 
that Pakistan should hold direct talks with India to solve the 
Kashmir issue. The Indian minister also held talks with his 
Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar Velayati and apprised him of the 
latest situation in the Kashmir valley. Mr. Velayati felt that 
there was much scope for cooperation between India, China, and 
Iran on a regional basis. Later, the Indian minister also held 
talks with his Chinese counterpart, Mr. Qian Qichen, who was in 
Teheran on Sunday [March 6]. Mr. Qichen described Pakistan's 
tabling of the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission 
in Geneva as being out of context. He said Beijing favors a 
solution of the Kashmir issue within the framework of the Simla 
accord. The Indian foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, at the 
end of the Teheran visit said that both China and Iran agreed 
with India that human rights should not be used by nations as a 
political tool. 
  [Srinivasan] This was to have a successful joint commission 
meeting but it so happened that it was coincident with the 
ongoing round at Geneva and also coincidental to the Chinese 
foreign minister's visit to Teheran. It gave us an opportunity 
to present our point of view at foreign minister's level and I 
think that our point of view has been well received in both 
capitals, or rather in Teheran and by the Chinese foreign 
minister's delegation. [end recording]

  [Text] Tehran, March 8, IRNA -- First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Mohammad Hashemi said at the gathering of African 
diplomats in Tehran that the Islamic Republic wishes to broaden 
relations with African countries. 
  Hashemi who was addressing a reception at the embassy of 
Sudan said since the triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1979, 
Iran has been a friendly country to all African states, and 
supports the struggle of African peoples against racial 
discrimination. 
  He said the Africans have added a golden leaf to the history 
of the struggles of world nations, and today certain sources 
that claim to be concerned about the status of human rights 
accuse certain African states of human rights violations while 
they continue to plunder the resources of the very same African 
countries. 
  He said the Islamic Republic looks forward to broader 
cooperation with the African nations in the area of politics, 
economy and culture.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] The UN Security Council will possibly issue a 
resolution on the tragic massacre of the worshipers at the 
al-Ibrahimi shrine in al-Khalil. It is 12 days since this 
shocking tragedy took place, and despite extensive regional and 
international reaction condemning it, the continuation of strong 
protests by the Palestinians, and the unprecedented clashes 
between the Zionist occupiers and the oppressed Palestinians, 
the UN Security Council has refrained from issuing a resolution 
on this. 
  The only thing that has prevented this resolution has been 
U.S. opposition to the condemnation of the Zionist regime's 
unprecedented crime in the massacre of worshipers. Despite 
fundamental changes in the international balance of power with 
the end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Eastern 
bloc, one can see that UN decisions do not go beyond the 
traditional frameworks based on alliances and that criteria such 
as justness and humanity, as well as true security, have not 
found their suitable place in UN decisions. 
  Even though the United States feigns to be a mere observer 
in 
the so-called Arab-Israeli compromise talks and should thus take 
an impartial approach to incidents, it has impudently adopted a 
pro- Zionist policy vis-a-vis a calamity, the condemnation of 
which no one has the least bit of doubt, and is ignoring world 
public opinion. 
  This stance by the White House stems from the fact that on 
the basis of international laws and the conventions on war, 
prisoners of war, and occupied territories, especially the 
Fourth Convention of Geneva, the Zionist regime is legally 
responsible for ensuring the security of the residents in the 
occupied territories. If the Zionist regime is unwilling or 
unable to ensure the security of the Palestinians, it should 
hand over this duty to international organizations. Since the 
Zionist regime wants to crush the risen Palestinians, on the one 
hand, and does not want a third party to enter the scene in 
order to cover up its crimes, on the other, it opposes the 
dispatch of UN peacekeeping forces to the occupied territories. 
Thus, the United States, which regards the Zionist regime's 
behavior to be part of the confrontation with the wave of 
Islamism and the Islamic revolution and in line with its own and 
the Zionist regime's interests, extends unconditional support 
for this regime. 
  However, behind the U.S.-Zionist regime's confrontation with 
the wave of Islamism and the just uprising of the Palestinians, 
talks are being held in the UN corridors between the United 
States and the compromising Palestinian faction on the one side 
and the Zionist regime and 'Arafat's representative on the 
other. Egypt also plays the role of mediator in these talks. 
  Political experts consider the issuance of a Security 
Council 
resolution on this issue to be contingent on a compromise 
between Tel Aviv and 'Arafat on the Palestinian demands on what 
should be stated in the resolution. The Palestinian side--which 
has been greatly disgraced among the Palestinians because of its 
recent compromise on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho, as well as 
ensuing agreements--has lost its support, is propounding demands 
that ultimately benefit the Zionist regime, and is trying to 
slightly repair its domestic image. Thus, it wants the 
resolution to emphasize international support for Palestinians 
and to clarify the situation of Jerusalem. 
  However, experts believe that Israel will not give in to 
these two demands and, in view of U.S. support for the Zionist 
regime and the composition of the Security Council, no serious 
resolution is expected to be issued.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak at al-Azhar University in </F>
Cairo on 8 March--live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. The grand imam of al-Azhar, venerable ulemas, 
brothers and sisters, dear sons: Feelings of veneration and 
devotion engulf all of us at this meeting on this blessed night, 
as we derive the noble morals and deep lessons on the occasion 
marking the night when the skies inspired the Prophet, God's 
peace and blessings be upon him. Yes, this is the occasion when 
the holy inspiration manifested itself to the Prophet on the 
night the Koran was revealed--a night holier than 1,000 months. 
Our celebration of this occasion, which in our hearts and minds 
is associated with the greatest divine verses, is worthy of 
inspiring us with the best lessons and greatest preachings. How 
true God's words are in His holy book: "But teach thy message 
for teaching benefits the believers." [Koranic verse] 
  We have the most noble potentials, with which we mobilize 
ourselves, and the best lessons, with which we train our minds, 
while reliving this glorious commemoration; it is for us to see 
these things as the Creator wanted us to see them through his 
holy Koran--as guidance and mercy for all people. We should 
turn it into an appropriate annual occasion, at which we pause 
to review the state of the nation. We hold ourselves 
accountable before others. We read our files and record of 
achievements before they are read to us out of our desire to 
rectify our steps, correct our trends, and work on overcoming 
the obstacles before us. This should take place on the basis of 
the noble Islamic values and correct Islamic morality that we 
acquire from the wise teachings God sent us in the form of a 
book which, without the shadow of a doubt, is guidance for the 
devout and a blessed message from the skies to the earth to 
light the path of progress and prosperity for all mankind. 
  The Koran is the lighthouse leading to the haven of security 
and the shore of salvation for those who are oppressed and 
tossed around by the storms of disaster. This has been 
confirmed by historic developments throughout the ages when the 
Muslims were guided by its tolerant values and noble principles. 
They progressed, developed, and advanced as advocates of 
justice and goodwill until the light of Islam and its teachings 
dawned on the most important parts of the world. 
  The Koran brought the Arabs out of darkness and ignorance 
into the realm of knowledge and civilization. It turned them 
from divided tribes and unrighteous paganism into a united and 
monotheist nation. It uplifted them from conflicts and 
divisions to the realms of accord, harmony, compassion, and 
peace. Islam then spread East and West and its minarets and 
banners rose everywhere. This clear victory was achieved thanks 
to the Koran's immortal humanitarian and civilized values, which 
Islam added to man's civilization. The most significant of 
these values are those of freedom, tolerance, equality, justice, 
fraternity, cooperation, love, and peace. Islam acknowledges 
the value of useful knowledge and appreciates didactic 
literature and sublime art. It exalts the value of serious 
effort and considers straightforward ethics as a basic part of 
religion and even the main goal of religiosity. 
  A look at the affairs of the Muslim people today fills us 
with pain, despite the successes achieved by our Muslim people 
in many areas and the accomplishments attained due to the 
efforts of faithful leaders, the sacrifices of our martyrs, and 
the endeavors of good citizens. A look at the affairs of our 
people and reflection on our conditions would bring sorrow to 
our souls, agony to our hearts, and would puzzle our intellect. 
What pains us in our people's situation today are those 
negative phenomena that are completely alien to our nature and 
at odds with the tenets of our God-given faith. Among these 
phenomena are: 
  First, ravaging conflicts; 
  Second, disabling backwardness; 
  Third, disrupting discord, destructive terrorism, fanatic 
extremism, rampant deviation, and misguided doctrines. 
  Brothers and sisters, regrettably, we can see divisive 
conflicts in more than one place in the Islamic world. These 
conflicts take many and varied forms, ranging from tribal power 
struggles and ideological power struggles to ethnic power 
struggles aimed at domination. They sometimes take the form of 
material conflicts to satisfy ambitions. I don't want to 
specify these areas of conflict or name the leaders or rival 
factions or say anything that might be considered interference 
in others' affairs. But I would like to say with clarity and 
conviction that these conflicts have nothing to do with our 
religion. No way do they serve the interests of our nation. 
The impact of these conflicts is evidently destructive, 
disunites our nation, undermines our force, and offends the 
image of Islam. They cause the death of many innocent people, 
bloodshed, waste our wealth, and destroy our establishments. 
The consequences of these conflicts will weaken and exhaust our 
nation and drown it in misery and wretchedness and threaten it, 
God forbid, with annihilation. 
  Strange that this struggle is taking place in several 
places in the Islamic world and is affecting and threatening us, 
despite the Koran's appeal for solidarity, call for 
collaboration, and prohibition of conflict and struggle. How 
great are the almighty's words: "And hold fast, all together, 
by the rope which God stretches out for you, and be not divided 
among yourselves." And his words: "And fall into no disputes, 
lest ye lose heart and your power depart." 
  The disabling backwardness has many forms in the life of our 
nation and different forms among the people. There is 
scientific backwardness, which has made the nation's illiteracy 
rate among the highest in the world. There is cultural 
backwardness, which has led to a lack of awareness among many 
people regarding the facts and changes of the age and has led to 
an unwarranted conflict between adherence to origins and keeping 
abreast of modern developments or between adherence to the 
teachings of religion and expressing views on temporal affairs 
or even unjustly claiming that thought, modernization, and 
development are contrary to religion. 
  There is also material backwardness, which has made many 
members of our nation importers, not producers or innovators, 
and deprived them of having their own means and applications 
appropriate for their conditions, the nature of their resources, 
and their manpower requirements. Puzzling is that all this 
appears in numerous places in our nation, although the Koran has 
urged the faithful to manage their own affairs and manage the 
creatures of the earth, and seek progress and the means for 
material, moral, and spiritual strength. The Koran also orders 
them to strive and work in every field of life, in building, in 
developing the universe, and in seeking education and knowledge. 
We must strive for scientific progress according to the 
almighty God's words: "Are those equal, those who know and 
those who do not know?" The almighty's words are: "Those truly 
fear God among his servants who have knowledge." 
  The Koran is full of testimonial verses calling for 
advancing 
thought and elevating sentiments and advocating innovation and 
the subjugation of nature to the use of mankind. How numerous 
are the Koranic verses that advocate the need to use our brains, 
correct the view, develop the mind, elevate the sentiments by 
walking through the land, following the news of nations, taking 
lessons from history, and contemplating the beauties of 
existence, the magnificence of creation, and the wonders of the 
universe. 
  We should remember that the first words revealed by God on 
that blessed night and the first words with which the heavens 
addressed the earth in those immortal moments were those sacred 
verses that open the eyes to the magnificence of the creation 
and call for knowledge and education. They, at the same time, 
glorify the most important tool for recording sciences, 
encyclopedias, and cultures. These sacred verses are the 
almighty's words: "Proclaim (or read) in the name of thy lord 
and cherisher, who created--created man out of a (mere) clot of 
congealed blood. Proclaim! And thy lord is most bountiful, he 
who taught (the use of) the pen--taught man that which he knew 
not." 
  Islam has fought backwardness in all its forms and persisted 
in urging the Muslims to take their place at the front. But we 
see among the negative phenomena in our nation today this 
disabling backwardness that halts the movement of the nation and 
stands between it and the glory and advancement it deserves. 
  As for the destructive terror, it is wreaking havoc in more 
than one area on the Islamic scene. Its conduct is wicked, 
criminal, aggressive, and shows disregard for human life. Its 
objectives are criminal. Its plans are bloody. Despite that, 
it masquerades in religious attire, hides behind a false claim 
of reform, and adopts deceptively attractive slogans. At the 
best of times, these slogans are words of truth but their 
objective is evil and misleading. But terrorism twists and 
deflects these slogans and takes them out of context to serve 
its criminal objectives and support its bloody plans. This is 
hypocrisy and those who practice it are the hypocrites whom God 
has condemned to eternal fire because they rephrase God's words 
and do what they do not state. 
  What does religion have to do with the killing of innocent 
people? Where do reform and piety stand with respect to 
spreading panic and bloodshed? Where is the justice in shaking 
stability, fighting a war against people's livelihood, and 
hampering progress and prosperity? Where is the honesty and 
piety in behavior that contradicts all the teachings dictated by 
the pure Koranic texts and the noble prophetic traditions such 
as the sanctity of human life and preserving the rights of 
mankind to freedom? 
  Where are the texts that sanction human bloodshed because 
they object to an individual's opinion or reject his ideas? Did 
not the almighty God say in precise verses: "Invite all to the 
way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue 
with them in ways that are best and most gracious. For thy lord 
knoweth best who have strayed from his path and who receive 
guidance." Where are the texts that sanction the bloodshed of 
innocent people, including those people who have nothing to do 
with a specific opinion or way of thinking? 
  Dear brothers and sisters, the holy Koran, which the 
hypocrites and terrorists use as their slogan and that has 
nothing to do with them, has stipulated: "If any one slew a 
person--unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the 
land--it would be as if he slew the whole people." [Koranic 
verse] 
  The terrorists claim the prophet of great Islam is their 
guide, while he rejects them and disassociates himself from them 
and has decreed that the sanctity of a Muslim's blood is greater 
to God than the sanctity of the Kaaba. He banned an individual 
from terrorizing his brother, even by merely directing a weapon 
at him or something that looks like a weapon and that frightens 
him. Terrorists and hypocrites add to their crimes of 
terrorizing, killing, and attacking innocent people one more 
crime: They explain religion for the sake of their vile 
objectives and exploit its texts for their destructive 
practices. They are lying to God and his prophet. They are 
oppressing God's people. "And soon will the unjust assailants 
know what vicissitudes their affairs will take." [Koranic 
verse] [applause] 
  As for extremism, ladies and gentlemen, we see mental 
extremism and arrested behavior in many stances diverting some 
people away from moderation, which is the course of our religion 
and the call of our Koran. This extremism and stagnation cause 
negative behavior among those who adopt such a course, thus 
pushing them to fight others and misjudge moderates. It leads 
them to seclusion and isolation to the extent of secession. 
This also leads them to making enemies with society at times 
and to desecrating and attacking it at other times. 
  Thus, hate driven by extremism becomes terrorism when it 
turns from a negative political stance into criminal and 
aggressive behavior. Extremism deflects Islamic behavior from 
the correct course because it obstructs social harmony, mental 
peace, and moderation. It leads to isolation and alienation and 
pushes individuals to resort to terrorism and to join bloody 
criminals and outlaws who have reneged on society and who attack 
peaceful citizens. These reneging extremists have distorted the 
image of Muslims. Many non-Muslims now judge Islam unfairly 
through the behavior of these extremists who belong to the 
nation of Islam. 
  It is painful that this happens while virtues are at the 
core 
of Islam. The most important aim of worship in Islam is to 
teach Muslims moral values and good behavior. The Koranic 
verses and the prophet's sayings are replete with calls for 
adherence to sublime moral values and virtuous behavior. 
  Brothers and sisters, these negative factors to which I have 
referred have obstructed the march of our nation, weakened it, 
and distorted its image. They have encouraged others to prey on 
this nation and have doubled the number of its enemies. As a 
result, some blatant forces have belittled some of the sons of 
our nation, cruelly torturing them, killing them brutally, and 
attacking their sanctities with barbarism. Because of these 
negative factors that have distorted the nation's image and 
increased the enemies of its religion some people have called 
for fighting this nation and eliminating it. Our nation cannot 
restore its prestige, retake its position, or catch up with the 
new world unless it gets rid of everything that obstructs its 
march, weakens it strength, and distorts its image. 
  The new world is the world of the strong who are respected 
by 
everyone, whose words are heard, and whose rights are 
safeguarded. The new world is the world of detente and unity, 
not of division and conflict. The new world, brothers and 
sisters, is the world of progress and development, not the world 
of backwardness and stagnation. The new world is that of 
integration and interaction, the exchange of interests, and 
cooperation for a better future, not of contradictions and 
contrasts and the depletion of wealth and resources. The new 
world is supposed to be the world of security, stability, and 
peace, not of disturbances, threats, intimidation, and 
bloodshed. The new world must be a world of openness, 
tolerance, and brotherhood, not a world torn asunder by 
fanaticism and extremism. The new world must be one of human 
values and good behavior, not of lawlessness, deviation, chaos, 
and barbarism. All these values preached by the new world have 
been preached by Islam and Prophet Muhammad since the holy 
inspiration descended on him on Laylat al-Qadr [night of the 
revelation of the Koran] and throughout his mission, which he 
performed perfectly until he died and joined his God. 
  If we want to correct our march and eschew our negative 
aspects, we have the verses of the holy Koran and the teachings 
of our great prophet to guide us so that we may forge ahead on 
the path of progress instead of remaining backward and stagnant. 
We can strive to achieve integration and cooperation instead of 
continuing with our contradictions and slackness. We must also 
promote a spirit of moderation in line with Islam's course and 
tolerance. We must first make morality and ethics the basis of 
our life, the framework of our activities, and the light of our 
behavior so that our way of life will be set right and so that 
our image will be corrected in others' eyes. We will thus be 
worthy of the Koranic verse: "Ye are the best of peoples, 
evolved for mankind." [Koranic verse] 
  Grand Imam and Rector of al-Azhar Mosque, O venerable ulema, 
brothers and sisters, you may agree with me that the best 
celebration of this blessed night lies in learning a useful 
lesson in its rich significance for our situation and our path. 
You may agree with me that our need for this lesson and 
significance is more pressing now than ever. Our nation, 
regrettably, is suffering from numerous negative aspects. Part 
of our nation is suffering from painful types of aggression and 
violation. These negative aspects and violations recently took 
a form that agonizes the hearts of the zealots and sincere 
people. Remedying these negative aspects and warding off 
violations lies, as I have often said, in following the values 
of the holy Koran and the example of our great prophet, may 
God's peace and prayers be upon him. 
  On this blessed night and from the grounds of the al-Azhar 
Mosque, I appeal to my brothers, sons of the Islamic nation 
everywhere, each to play a role in reviving his nation as much 
as he can. I appeal to everyone to face up to his duty and 
responsibility. We are all shepherds and every shepherd is 
responsible for his community. The basis of reviving the nation 
lies in adherence to its holy Koran, the principles of its 
prophet, and the teachings of its religion. Foremost among 
these values, principles, and teachings are cohesion and 
adherence to God's path in a way that rejects divisive conflicts 
and that rises and achieves progress and rejects disabling 
backwardness. They should seek integration and cooperation so 
as to end the divisive contradictions. They should seek to 
establish security and consolidate stability and finish off 
destructive terrorism. They should spread a spirit of 
moderation and tolerance to prevent rigid extremism. And last 
but not least, they should strengthen straightforward ethics and 
honest behavior to prevent rampant deviation. Brothers and 
sisters, let us begin today, not tomorrow, to perform our duty 
in adhering to these immortal humanitarian Islamic values that 
will ensure our salvation. Let us work with the utmost 
determination to eschew our negative aspects and achieve our 
renaissance. This is a selfless call that I address for the 
sake of God and the interest of my nation. I hope my brothers 
will heed this call. All I want is to create reform. God 
grants success. May God's peace and blessings be upon you. 
[applause]

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Mar (MENA)--PLO Executive Committee Member 
Mahmud 'Abbas has said that he discussed with Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa the crisis that the Palestinian-Israeli peace process 
is now experiencing as a result of the Hebron massacre. 
  He said after his meeting with the foreign minister today 
that they also discussed the Palestinian demands to resolve the 
crisis, both a UN Security Council resolution and measures that 
the Israeli Government needs to take to prevent the recurrence 
of the massacre. 
  He said the two sides also discussed cooperation between 
Egypt and the PLO to achieve the best results. 
  On the possibility of a summit meeting between Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, 'Abbas said such a meeting is out of the question before 
certain measures have been taken: the issuance of a Security 
Council resolution and adoption of specific Israeli positions to 
handle the crisis resulting from the massacre. 
  On the Palestinian proposals presented to Rabin, 'Abbas said 
the PLO has not yet received an Israeli reply. 
  He said the PLO presented specific and known proposals that 
can be summed up by the following questions: How can the 
Palestinian people be protected and how can another Hebron 
massacre be prevented? We have not yet received a reply from 
the Israeli Government, he said. 
  What is needed, 'Abbas asserted, is UN-recognized 
international observers to protect the Palestinians.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] AL-SHA'B has obtained information proving the 
involvement of the Israeli army chiefs in the criminal massacre 
of the Palestinians in the honorable al-Ibrahimi Mosque last 
Friday. The massacre led to the martyrdom of 90 Palestinians and 
the wounding of some 500. 
  The information confirms that the massacre was arranged in 
the wake of the recent agreement signed in Cairo between Yasir 
'Arafat and terrorist Shim'on Peres, the foreign minister of the 
Zionist enemy. According to this information, Israeli Chief of 
Staff Ehuda Barak received the plan for attacking the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in the first week of February. In light of 
that plan, he gave orders to change the security guards in the 
city of Hebron one week before the massacre. The change 
involved 20 security chiefs, who were informed of the details of 
the settlers' scheme to commit the massacre. 
  Our information is that the Israeli security chiefs ordered 
the Israeli soldiers to intervene should the plan fail or in 
case the Palestinians resisted the settlers who had been 
selected to carry out the plan. The name "Operation Theresa" 
was given to the operation to storm the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and 
slaughter worshipers inside it. "Theresa" is the name of a 
leading settler who took part in arranging the massacre together 
with the chief of staff and three Israeli leaders. Operation 
Theresa was the literal outcome of the seven agreements Rabin 
signed with settlers leaders, the agreements which AL-SHA'B 
publicized a few months back. 
  Information reveals that sophisticated Israeli weapons were 
handed to the settlers 48 hours before the massacre. The 
weapons were transported from the United States by the terrorist 
Zionist groups, who are still in possession of these weapons. 
  According to our information, the criminal who was said to 
have committed the al-Ibrahimi massacre was an officer in the 
Israeli Army.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry issued a sudden decision on 
Thursday, 24 February, expelling two foreign correspondents, the 
chief of REUTER, Cairo, and another Western reporter (believed 
to be AFP's), to punish them for covering acts of violence and 
publishing reports without checking out their validity. 
  The decision was made at the peak of police wrath at foreign 
correspondents. A week ago, the Interior Ministry summoned the 
AFP bureau chief and reproached him for circulating inaccurate 
reports. He was accused of hostility to Egypt and threatened 
with expulsion. 
  AL-SHA'B has learned that the Ministry of Information was 
not 
notified of the expulsion decision, but the information minister 
learned of the matter at the last moment -- before the decision 
was enforced -- from the foreign correspondents association. He 
made immediate contacts that resulted in revoking the expulsion 
decision. 
  Not only did Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif revoke 
the 
decision, he even met with the board of the Foreign 
Correspondents Association last Saturday and voiced his 
confidence in them. He assured them that his ministry and not 
the Ministry of Interior, will be responsible for dealing with 
foreign correspondents. 
  It is rumored that the information minister's decision has 
created a crisis between his ministry and the Ministry of 
Interior.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Mar (MENA)--The State Security 
Investigation Service [SSIS] has arrested 25 terrorists 
responsible for the recent wave of bomb attacks on banks in 
Cairo and al-Jizah. Revealing the information, an Interior 
Ministry source said that SSIS officers obtained search warrants 
from the Public Prosecution Office and stormed terrorist 
hideouts in Cairo, al-Jizah, Suez, al- Qalyubiyah, and 
al-Sharqiyah. 
  The source said that among those arrested is a man who was 
in 
charge of liaison between the group's [not further specified] 
members at home and abroad. 
  The source added that at the time of his arrest this 
terrorist was in possession of an explosive charge matching 
those used in the recent bombings, dynamite sticks, and foreign 
currency. 
  Among those arrested are 'Irfan Muhammad Hasan al-Khuli, 
sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor in connection 
with the 1993 military case involving a shooting in Zinhum area 
in Cairo; Yasir Fathi Muhammad Ahmad Fawwaz, who is wanted by 
the police for involvement in terrorist attacks including one 
against a tourist bus in Asyut; Muhammad Fawzi Muhammad Ibrahim 
al-Sayyid, a leading member of the organization [not further 
specified] in Suez, who is wanted by the police for involvement 
in acts of violence in Suez; and Ahmad 'Abd-al-Fattah Sayyid 
'Uthman, a member of the organization [not further specified] in 
east Cairo. 
  The Higher State Security Prosecution Office is 
interrogating 
the defendants. According to the source, the suspects have 
admitted involvement in the recent wave of bomb attacks against 
several banks in Cairo and al-Jizah. They also admitted 
plotting to assassinate public figures and policemen. 
  The source said suspects' confessions confirmed information 
available to the SSIS that some fugitive terrorist leaders--some 
still in Afghanistan and others who have returned from 
there--are involved in planning, giving assignments, and 
financing the said terrorist moves. These fugitive leaders are: 
  --Tal'at Yasin Muhammad Hammam, a fugitive sentenced to 
death 
in the case of the Returnees From Afghanistan Organization. 
  --Islam Ahmad Muhammad al-Gharmi, a fugitive leader trained 
in Afghanistan to carry out bombings. 
  Husam Muhammad Khamis Nuwayr, a fugitive terrorist leader 
wanted in the case of Dr. Rif'at al-Mahjub's assassination. 
  One of the detainees, the security source added, is a 
fugitive leader sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor in 
Military Crimes Case 19/93, concerning the shooting in Zinhum 
region. 
  Another detainee is a fugitive in Yemen tasked to receive 
sophisticated training in Afghanistan on remotely-controlled 
bombings. He was sent to Egypt about four months ago to take 
part in planned suicidal operations targeting the motorcade of 
an important figure. 
  The Interior Ministry praised the public's positive 
involvement in confronting and foiling the criminal schemes of 
the terrorists and extremists.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Egyptian Islamic fundamentalist </F>
Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim by Charlotte Aagaard; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] In the past week a hitherto unknown man, Tal'at 
Fu'ad Qassim, has come under media spotlight because, as a 
supporter of the militant Islamic group Al-Gama'a Islamiya, he 
has been accused of turning Denmark into a base for "terror" 
against the Egyptian Government and of having encouraged 
violence against foreigners in Egypt. 
  All of this has happened since Qassim obtained political 
asylum in Denmark. 
  In an exclusive interview with INFORMATION, however, he 
rejects the accusations, and asserts his right -- on an equal 
footing with thousands of other refugees in Denmark -- to 
maintain his involvement in political developments in his own 
country. 
<H5>  A Committed Man </H5>
  And committed he is. You sense it at once as he walks into 
the living room on the fifth floor of an apartment block in 
Valby. 
  Committed, reserved, shy, and worried. These are the words 
that come to mind as he sits down on the couch, keeping on his 
light brown, Afghan camel-hair hat, supplementing the Islamist's 
traditional uniform: long white robe, baggy trousers, long 
black beard and short hair. 
  It is Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, so it is only 
INFORMATION's reporter, the photographer and the six-year old 
son of the house who are offered juice, biscuits, and fresh 
dates in welcome. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim recounts the beginnings of his political 
activity in Al-Gama'a Islamiya during his student days at the 
university of Assuit, situated on the banks of the Nile in 
central Egypt. At that time Al Gama'a was a student movement, 
but today the group, which is thought to number 10,000 militant 
activists and a far larger group of sympathizers, is engaged in 
an armed struggle against the Egyptian government. In Assuit, 
Qassim was studying engineering, but was imprisoned for his part 
in student riots just after he had completed his exams. 
  He spent eight years in an Egyptian jail until December 
1989, 
when he succeeded in escaping, first to Peshawar in Pakistan, 
the Islamic Mujahidin's headquarters. Here he was the chief 
editor of the paper AL-MURABITUN, and head of the Arab press 
federation. There was no question of active resistance to the 
Communist enemy in Kabul, however. 
  In May 1992 he came to Denmark as a result of an invitation 
to hold a series of lectures, sought political asylum, and was 
granted it, partly on account of a death sentence passed on him 
in absentia by an Egyptian military court in January, 1993. 
  His view is that the accusations -- which range from the 
attempted overthrow of the government, complicity in the murder 
of politicians, to unlawful possession of weapons -- are the 
fabrications of the Egyptian Government. Amnesty International 
pronounced the trial unfair due to the absence of a defence and 
lack of the right to appeal. 
  Today, Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim describes his role in Al-Gama'a 
Islamiya as that of a source of ideological inspiration. 
  "I have not had any physical contact with Al-Gama'a in Egypt 
since I left the country. The link is on a spiritual level. 
Perhaps people read my publications or hear my speeches." 
Qassim stresses, however, that his knowledge of the 
organization makes him fully capable of speaking on its behalf. 
<H5>  Political Commitment </H5>
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim flatly denies the claim that he is a 
part 
of an international network of Al-Gama'a people who, from their 
position in exile, lead the struggle and organize violent action 
against Mubarak's government: 
  "It is an outright lie. It is an attempt on the part of the 
Egyptian Government to justify its actions towards Al-Gama'a 
activists and to take attention away from the government's 
failed economic and social policy." 
  However, he is not prepared to give up the right to 
political 
involvement. 
  "I came to Denmark to live in peace. I have no intention of 
creating problems here, but I cannot ignore what is happening in 
Egypt. I do the same as tens of thousands of Lebanese, 
Palestinian, or Iranian refugees. I do, after all, have the 
right to hold an opinion on what is happening in my home country 
-- and the right to express it." 
  Qassim told us he was disappointed that his right to asylum 
in Denmark has been publicly questioned. 
  "If I am unwelcome in Denmark, then I am ready to take the 
first plane back to Egypt and face my death sentence. But if I 
am handed over, no Dane will be able to look in the mirror 
without seeing hypocrisy staring him in the face." 
  For the moment, extradition to Egypt is impossible according 
to INFORMATION's sources, simply because Denmark is a 
co-signatory of a number of conventions which prohibit the 
handing over of people condemned to death. 

<H5>    Violence Against Foreigners </H5>
  Another claim which has been put forward by the media is 
that 
in the Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI, Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim 
allegedly incited violence against foreigners, including Danes, 
who travel to Egypt as tourists, work, or invest there. 
  This includes, among others, F.L. Smith, A.P. Moller, and 
Aarhus Flydedok. Denmark also finances a number of aid projects 
in Egypt. 
  "I have never given an interview to the newspaper in 
question. It is a fabrication. Al-Gama'a Islamiya printed a 
communique warning foreigners against going to Egypt out of 
concern for their safety, because they are in confrontation with 
the government. It is every Muslim's duty to ensure the safety 
of visitors, and that safety cannot be guaranteed at the moment. 
Therefore it would be unwise to travel to Egypt." 
  "Would a tourist be likely to go on holiday to Sarajevo, 
Mogadishu, or Baghdad? It is the same in Egypt today. Egypt is 
involved in a violent confrontation and it would not be safe for 
tourists to go there." 
  He also finds it "difficult to imagine good Muslims being 
involved in attacks on innocent tourists." Instead, he accuses 
forces within the Egyptian government of being behind the 
attacks on tourists which until now have cost seven foreigners 
their lives and wounded dozens of others. The purpose of this, 
according to Qassim, is to justify the brutality used against 
the Islamic opposition and to discredit it. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim thinks that there is one good 
explanation 
for the furore caused by a series of articles on him. 
  "Since the end of the Cold War and the collapse of 
communism, 
Islamophobia, the fear of Islam, has spread like wildfire. I 
cannot understand why people here in the West are so keen to 
create a boogeyman. It only serves as a provocation." Qassim 
wants to see more objectivity in the descriptions of what is 
happening in the Islamic world. 
  Asked whether he is unable to understand Danes' fear of 
Islam, when they have the deaths of foreign tourists in Algeria 
and Egypt as well as the bloody Iranian revolution at the back 
of their minds, he answered: 
  "Yes, I can well understand that. But then the Danes must 
also appreciate how ordinary Egyptians feel. The Egyptians can 
be compared to a dove in a cage. Normally doves are very 
peaceful animals, but if they are put into a cage it is only 
natural that they peck your finger. When the Muslims in Egypt 
shake off the dictatorship and introduce an Islamic system, 
people will see that there is nothing to be afraid of." 
  When the Islamic forces take over power in Egypt, which, 
according to Qassim will happen "before most people expect it", 
foreigners will again be welcome and assured of their safety in 
Egypt, he promised.

  [Text] Cairo, March 8 (AFP)--PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
called Tuesday [8 March] for 1,000 armed military observers to 
be deployed in the occupied territories to protect the 
Palestinians in the wake of the Hebron massacre. 
  'Arafat told the Egyptian daily AL-JUMHURIYAH: "We don't 
want 
a force equipped with heavy arms and tanks. We are only asking 
for two battalions, about 1,000 men, carrying individual arms as 
part of a multinational force." 
  He added that Russia, France, Britain and Belgium had agreed 
to take part in such an international force. 
  Meanwhile the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
representative in Cairo, Sa'id Kamal, told AFP that the 
observers must be deployed "immediately" in Hebron before the 
stalled PLO-Israeli talks can resume. 
  The PLO has insisted that measures be taken to protect 
Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and West Bank before it 
agrees to resume talks with Israel on implementing the September 
13 accord on Palestinian self-rule. 
  The talks were suspended in the wake of the Hebron massacre 
when a Jewish settler slaughtered 29 Muslims at prayer. 
  Kamal said: "We are asking for an Israeli agreement in 
principle on international protection for Palestinians in the 
occupied territories which must start immediately with the 
deployment of observers in Hebron." 
  'Arafat told AL-JUMHURIYAH that if the PLO's demands on 
security guarantees were met, "the confidence of the Palestinian 
population could be restored."

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has emphasized that he refuses to meet with any Israeli 
official under the present circumstances and until the 
consequences of the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron 
in the occupied West Bank are removed. 
  In a statement published in today's issue of the opposition 
weekly magazine AL-AHALI, 'Arafat said several attempts have 
been made to hold a meeting between him and Israeli officials, a 
lot of pressure has been applied, and international forces have 
interfered in arranging such a meeting, but he refuses until 
Israel takes specific and practical measures that show a real 
desire to safeguard the security of the Palestinian people, who 
are under occupation. 
  'Arafat stressed the PLO's adherence to a peaceful solution 
and its commitment to the agreements reached so far. He also 
referred to the continuing coordination and consultations with 
Egypt on the peace process in the Middle East.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday evening Brother Abu-'Ammar, president 
of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee, received Viktor Vasilyev, special envoy of Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin for the Middle East peace process. 
  During the meeting, which came as a continuation of 
Palestinian-Russian contacts, a discussion took place on the 
current developments in the situation in the region, in light of 
the massacre carried out by Zionist settlers in the holy Ibrahim 
mosque against the sons of the Palestinian people. 
  The Russian envoy informed President 'Arafat of the 
viewpoints of the Russian leadership on the latest developments. 
Brother President Abu-'Ammar told the Russian envoy of all the 
developments which have taken place at the UN Security Council 
concerning the importance of international protection, the 
Jerusalem issue, and the problem of settlements and armed 
settlers, particularly the extremists among them, inside the 
Palestinian cities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Allam: "Washington Proposes, PLO Rules </F>
Out Imminent Meeting Between 'Arafat, Rabin"] 
  [Excerpts] Cairo -- [Passage omitted] Palestinian sources 
have said that "'Arafat will not meet with Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres until the Security Council adopts a clear 
and decisive resolution" on the Hebron incident. 
  The sources said that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher offered Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the 
Palestinian president, during the latter's visit to Washington 
the U.S. Administration's willingness to host a high-level 
meeting in Washington to discuss Palestinian demands, resume the 
negotiations, and impart impetus to the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, because that "would be considered an 
achievement and a victory over the forces of extremism." 
  The Palestinian sources stressed "Palestinian eagerness to 
continue the negotiations and implement the agreement." 
However, they expressed the "PLO's insistence on the adoption 
of an international resolution, inasmuch as Security Council 
resolutions should not be ignored as an authority, nor should 
this disregard be perpetuated, as reflected in the U.S. offer." 
The sources stressed that the "PLO cannot ignore angry 
Palestinian reactions inside the the occupied territories." 
  The sources said that "a meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin 
in 
this atmosphere will not be successful." However, they pointed 
out that "the U.S. position is being studied, as is the 
possibility of holding such a meeting" -- that is, if suitable 
conditions are available to ensure its success, "first and 
foremost the adoption of an international resolution." The 
sources went on: "It is the U.S. Administration which is in an 
embarrassing position, not the PLO, which enjoys collective 
international -- with the exception of the United States and 
Israel -- support for its demands." [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether the PLO would accept Israeli proposals that 
respond to PLO demands, provided an international resolution is 
not adopted, the Palestinian sources stressed to AL-HAYAH that 
"that is ruled out, because it would constitute a precedent." 
They also said: "The international organization's disregard 
for a massacre committed within the context of a conflict on 
which a considerable number of international resolutions have 
been adopted is a precedent with regard to the Security Council 
and represents the first real nail in the United Nation's 
coffin."

  [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have said the Tunis 
headquartered PLO leadership has issued stringent orders to its 
armed cadres in the occupied territories to collect their 
weapons and store them with reliable persons, and not to use 
them in any fashion whatsoever. 
  The instructions were issued after the PLO leadership 
received reports that some armed Fatah cadres were planning 
massive reprisals in retaliation against the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. 
  Sources close to the Hamas Movement have said the 
Palestinian 
leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any military 
operations at present, and that it will persist with the civil 
disobedience campaign, contending that military operations at 
present could undermine political gains. 
  The sources said Hamas halfheartedly responded to this 
request, but said it cannot restrain its cadres inside the 
occupied territories due to the monstrosity of the [Hebron] 
massacre.

  [Text] Tunis, 7 Mar (MENA)-A group of PLO cadres in Tunisia 
has called for halting the negotiations with Israel at all 
levels and for suspending the promises and agreements until the 
Israeli settlers have been disarmed, the settlements in the West 
Bank and Gaza have been removed, and international protection 
has been provided for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories. 
  The group--which includes 120 members of the PLO, the Fatah 
Movement's Revolutionary Council, and the Palestine National 
Council--has demanded the rejection of the suspicious calls to 
change the venue of the negotiations or to resume them before 
the settlements are removed. 
  This is said in a statement issued and signed by this group, 
a copy of which was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
Zuhdi al-Tarazi, the Palestinian president's adviser; 
Abu-Ja'far, director of the PLO's Political Department; and a 
number of Palestinian writers and journalists were among the 
signatories. 
  The statement denounces the massacre and says that the 
Israeli enemy, which is backed by world imperialism under U.S. 
leadership, will not be satisfied with anything less than the 
liquidation of the innocent owners of the land and the seizure 
of their lands and possessions. 
  The statement adds that Israel's involvement in 
reconciliation and negotiations is merely a maneuver to give 
them a better chance to minimize their losses and avoid blame.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Faruq Qaddumi, head of 
the PLO Political Department, has said that the march of 
Palestinian-Jordanian cooperation and coordination in all areas 
is necessary in order to maintain joint interests and bolster 
cohesion between the two peoples on clear bases employing 
effective mechanisms and demonstrating a zealous and determined 
spirit. 
  In an interview with the JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY, Qaddumi 
stressed that the issue of cooperation between the Palestinian 
and Jordanian brothers can only be viewed as an indisputable 
fact that should not ignored. He said there was no serious 
coordination or cooperation for a period of time, but serious 
work began after the emergence of dangers resulting from new 
facts following the signing of the Declaration of Principles. 
  He said that joint interests strongly influence both parties 
and that our common fate is left to its destiny. He stressed 
that we should take quick and wide steps on the road of 
cooperation and coordination in order to face future challenges 
that will be reinforced by many upcoming political, economic, 
and social changes. 
  Answering a question on Israeli procrastination during the 
peace negotiations, Qaddumi said: Any observer of Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's stands, since the signing of the 
Declaration of Principles, will notice that he is hesitant and 
stringent and is adopting decisions that he intends to implement 
by force. 
  Qaddumi added that, through his political policy, the 
Israeli 
prime minister aims at containing the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
in a a somewhat coercive manner. At the same time, the Israeli 
prime minister is announcing that the dates of withdrawal 
stipulated in the Declaration of Principles are not sacred. 
  Qaddumi noted that Rabin is justifying his failure to commit 
himself to these dates by what he calls the issue of security. 
He insists on keeping the military positions inside the areas 
from which the Israeli Army is supposed to withdraw. 
  He explained that the issue of security is subject to 
discussion because Israel is considered the country with the 
strongest military power in the Middle East. Israel has 
concluded agreements with Egypt and the Palestinians and is 
expected to conclude agreements with the rest of the Arab 
parties concerned with the peace process. Qaddumi said that 
Israel owns weapons of mass destruction, stressing that Israel's 
pretext of maintaining its security are void in the face of 
these facts that are known to the entire world. 
  Qaddumi said that Rabin insisted in the recent negotiations, 
which concluded with the Cairo agreement, on controlling the 
crossing points, and he is still prevaricating by not defining 
the Jericho area, which was 345 square km at the time of the 
British mandate. The Israelis, he noted, are holding 
negotiations over every inch of this area, although the 
agreement stipulates another withdrawal from all these areas 
after two months. 
  He went on to say that the Israeli prime minister instructed 
the negotiating delegation to be intransigent enough to depict 
Israel as if it is the owner of the right to this territory and 
that it is offering a piece of it as a grant to the Palestinians 
to live on. They forget UN Security Council 242, which is the 
basis for a political settlement. 
  Qaddumi said that the Israelis insist on maintaining a 
presence in the Palestinian territories through military and 
security posts or settlements. The Israelis also insist on 
taking part in the administration of security issues in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho areas from which they will withdraw. They 
also insist on freedom of movement for the Israeli Army and 
settlers in these areas. 
  He noted that the Israelis are expanding Israeli settlements 
and are connecting them to wide streets patrolled by a joint 
force of Israeli soldiers and settlers. He said that everyday, 
the Israeli prime minister is placing more nails in the coffin 
of the Declaration of Principles. At the same time, he is 
announcing that his coercive policy will lead to a just and 
lasting peace. 
  Qaddumi noted that Rabin is setting conditions for 
withdrawal. These include reaching economic agreements and a 
customs unity, approving the shekel as an official unit of 
currency, getting familiar with members of the national 
authority and studying their files, as well as controlling who 
enters and leaves Gaza and Jericho. 
  Qaddumi said: How can Rabin ask this before the 
Palestinians start to run their own affairs? One of the basic 
conditions for signing contracts is that we have sovereignty 
over our land, complete sovereignty so that we can sign 
contracts on customs, financial, and other affairs as an equal 
to Israel. 
  Qaddumi said that the Israelis are trying, through their 
current policy, to convince the world that they will reach a 
just solution to the Palestinian cause while they impose more 
restrictions on our people and on our occupied Palestinian 
homeland. He said that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, 
and the Arab-Israeli negotiations in general, will expose the 
Israeli stand and that the world at large will see through 
tangible evidence that Israel rejects peace and is leading the 
region toward more tension, anxiety, and instability. 
  In reply to a question on international assistance to the 
Palestinians, Qaddumi said that several countries that 
participated in the economic conference in Washington on 1 
October last year had set the sums they will allocate as 
economic assistance to the Palestinian people in the West Bank 
and the Gaza Strip. 
  Qaddumi added that the World Bank was charged with 
administering the these funds to finance economic projects the 
Palestinian territories need. He said that intensive contacts 
were held with all the concerned parties to start the 
implementation of these projects, and that, particularly, some 
European countries had asked us to deal with them on a bilateral 
level and through the EC. 
  Qaddumi explained that certain Islamic states have offered 
financial assistance to cover some current expenditures and that 
there is a need for more funds to cover expenses in security, 
education, health, and other fields. He said implementation 
will start as soon as possible on some projects for which 
contracts were signed with the donors. 
  Qaddumi referred to statements by Israeli officials that 
European and U.S. assistance will not reach the Palestinians 
unless agreement is reached on all outstanding issues. He 
stressed that the concerned quarters in the donor countries were 
asked to protest these statements, which are viewed as a form of 
blackmail. 
  Qaddumi said that some Islamic states have offered 
assistance, specifically for covering part of the current 
expenditures and to keep institutions in the occupied 
territories operational while other countries have earmarked 
their grants and loans for building projects, and maintaining 
and developing already established institutions. 
  Speaking about the criticism some Palestinian and Arab 
parties leveled at the Cairo agreement, Qaddumi said: Every 
Palestinian has the right to level constructive criticism at 
Palestinian officials. Such a right should be nurtured 
throughout the Arab homeland. The Cairo agreement and the 
Declaration of Principles are not sacred and one can criticize 
them, but in a constructive and not a destructive manner, in a 
manner that unites and does not divide, and in a manner that 
strengthens one's resolve to achieve national unity.

<F P=106> [Report by Marc Roche on interview with PLO "Finance </F>
Minister" Jawid al-Ghusayn in London; date not given: "The 
Economy Will Follow, the PLO `Finance Minister' Declared to Us"] 
  [Text] Jawid al-Ghusayn, PLO "finance minister" and 
president of the Palestinian National Fund, is certainly not a 
fanatical idealist. A very rich businessman, he lives in London 
and displays great moderation. The PLO's big financier, a 
liberal, explains that the market economy will be imposed in the 
occupied territories but he cautiously stressed that a climate 
of confidence is vital and that the settlement of the political 
problems is a precondition for any economic development. 
  "To attract investment and channel funds to lasting 
development projects, we want to establish a market economy in 
which the private sector and not the public sector will play the 
main role." In different times, Jawid al-Ghusayn could have 
held court in the room furnished with cushions where the 
sultan's council met under the Ottoman occupation, but he does 
not give the impression of being idle. There is no sign of 
Palestine in this luxury Mayfair apartment, in the fashionable 
district of London, with modernist decoration from which no 
detail is absent, not even the thirties' furniture and the 
abstract paintings. 
  The president of the Palestinian National Fund, with his 
sober suit and his club necktie, blends with the City 
financiers. And when this very rich businessman, a member of a 
famous family of citrus fruit farmers in the Gaza strip, 
mentions the 13 September 1993 agreement between Israel and the 
PLO, there is no trace of sentimentality in what he says: "To 
establish good cooperation, the psychological environment is 
crucial. When you choose an associate, this agreement is based 
on confidence, reciprocity, equality between the parties. How 
can you build the future if you distrust each other?" If, like 
any well-born Palestinian, our interlocutor feels he is partly 
British, it is by his phlegm, the almost infectious calmness, 
that he shows it: "Let us first solve the political problems 
and the economy will follow." 
<H5>  Businessman </H5>
  Jawid al-Ghusayn? Who is he? We do not even know what the 
"Who's Who in the Arab World?" nonchalantly "forgotten" on the 
table, says of him. Why is it there? He is not in it. His 
history in business is like that of many Palestinian-born 
entrepreneurs, uprooted by the creation of the Israeli State in 
1948 or the rush to the Persian Gulf oil paradise in the early 
fifties. After studying economics at the American University in 
Cairo (where he met Yasir 'Arafat), this man, who is completely 
bilingual in Arabic and English, made his fortune in the 
construction industry, first in Kuwait, then in Abu Dhabi, and 
in Qatar. After winning comfortable commissions as 
intermediaries between the oil monarchies and the Western 
companies, many Palestinian businessmen gained positions in the 
public buildings and works sector, import-export, tourism, and 
agribusiness, always cropping up where nobody dared to venture. 
There is no sign of photographs of 'Arafat, yellowed engravings 
of the Dome of the Rock, or ashtrays in PLO colors. 
  Jawid al-Ghusayn, 63 years old, is not playing at being a 
defender of the Palestinian cause, he simply is one, holding an 
essential place within Fatah. Our interlocutor, who has been 
"PLO finance minister" since 1984, is a legitimate member of the 
executive committee. His department provides for the needs of 
bodies like the Association of Martyrs' Families, the Liberation 
Army, diplomatic missions, the payment of the organization's 
cadres, or financial support for the Intifadah. 
  He is also one of the founder leaders of the Welfare, the 
most powerful of the Palestinian charity organizations which 
works on aid projects in the sphere of training, healthcare, the 
preservation of the heritage in the occupied territories. It is 
an association set up by the famous "London Club" -- the 
informal set of rich businessmen of Palestinian origin based in 
the City. 

<H5>    Treasury </H5>
  Grouping entrepreneurs like 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman, president 
of the Arab Bank Group, Muhsin Kittani and Munib al-Masri, 
princes of the public buildings and works sector, and many 
others, this "London club" represents considerable economic 
influence. Its members, who prefer to work behind the scenes, 
have a bridgehead in Britain -- the former mandatory power -- 
and ties of confidence with what is called the English 
establishment. The private fortune of Palestinians abroad is 
estimated to be $10 billion. "One of the great assets of the 
future entity," according to John Milne, Bank of England adviser 
for the Near East. 
  "The era of socialism and nationalizations is over. 
Everybody is now privatizing," we were told by the big PLO 
financier. The organization's war "treasury" is estimated at $5 
billion. But the cessation of payments from the Arab countries, 
angered by the pro- Iraqi position taken by the PLO during the 
Gulf War, forced Jawid al-Ghusayn to reduce spending. Although 
he and Abu-al-'Ala', his colleague who is director of the PLO 
and Fatah Economic Committee, the man at the center of the 
secret talks with Israel, supervise this nest egg, Yasir 'Arafat 
is still the man who really has financial power. Jawid 
al-Ghusayn tried to be reassuring: "'Arafat, an engineer by 
training, was an entrepreneur in Kuwait before taking the reins 
of the PLO. He knows what economic liberalism and the free 
movement of capital mean." 
  However, there is no question of discussing big bucks or 
corruption. This is what real treasurers are like. "We want to 
build an efficient but light government machine. The 
inhabitants of the territories will be responsible for the 
administration, not expatriate cadres living in Tunis. They 
must have priority when hiring starts because they know the 
problems..." The businessman may well belong to the generation 
educated in the fifties and sixties, the great era of 
pan-Arabism, the Ba'th movement, and Nasirism, but his sober 
control of the Palestinian movement has always constantly been 
exercised in the direction of moderation. As befits a gentleman.

  [Text] Hakam Bal'awi, Fatah Central Committee member, 
official in charge of security, and the PLO's representative in 
Tunis, has said peace cannot be achieved in the presence of 
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Bal'awi added that the 
savage massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque reaffirmed that the 
settlements and peace are two parallel lines that do not 
converge. Settlements are the antithesis of the peace process 
because they represent an occupation force; a settlement is a 
military barracks and an offshoot of the army. Hence, 
withdrawal of the [Israeli] army, as a military occupation 
force, must be accompanied by the removal of settlements, he 
noted. 
  Bal'awi added that a settler is only an army reservist and 
that the perpetrator of the massacre was a clear example of a 
military settler. The massacre once again confirmed Israeli 
institutions have so far been raised on grudges and racism. The 
question posed is: Would this make it possible to achieve a 
just peace, and can work be done to prevent such a mentality? 
  The Palestinian official said credible efforts for genuine 
peace require immediate discussion of these settlements as an 
urgent issue, and that international protection should be 
provided for the sons of our Palestinian people. Bal'awi added 
that the Israeli establishment, which was raised on rancorous 
instructions and education, should not imagine that the 
Palestinian resistance cannot continue its defiance, 
confrontation, and all forms of struggle, until Israeli 
occupation of the Palestinian territories is terminated.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi has 
emphasized that the peace process has lost much of its 
credibility in the wake of the Hebron massacre. This situation 
has also impacted on the Palestinian leadership, which has lost 
a significant part of its credibility as a result of Israel's 
practices on the ground. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi noted that after the massacre, the 
Palestinian popular mood lost confidence in the current 
political process. It believes that the talks will be futile 
and harmful if they are resumed without Israel dropping its 
claims on Jerusalem and the settlements and halting all 
settlement activities, which seek to create new facts that 
dictate the outlines of the final stage before the beginning of 
the interim stage. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi stressed that the Palestinian leadership, 
which wants to be apprised of what the people in the occupied 
territories are saying now, should insist on the terms it has 
set and not back down. If the leadership wishes to regain its 
credibility, it should make those terms preconditions for 
returning to the negotiating table. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi added: We are not demanding impossible 
conditions, because the issue of the Palestinian residents' 
security must be sacred to the decisionmakers. Therefore, we 
must adhere to our demands, epitomized by disarming the 
settlers; ensuring effective international protection for our 
people in the occupied territories; and evacuating the 
settlements from Arab towns and heavily populated areas, such as 
the settlement quarter in the heart of Hebron and similar places. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi pointed out that adherence to these 
conditions might lead to the derailment of the peace process but 
that should this happen, the issue must be referred back to the 
international community to be resolved by it.

  [Text] Damascus, March 6, IRNA -- Secretary General of the 
Revolutionary Fatah Movement, Abu-Musa [Colonel Sa'id Musa 
Muragha] said here that the international Qods [Jerusalem] day 
is the manifestation of the Muslim ummah's true power in 
confronting the Israeli hegemony. 
  Abu-Musa told IRNA in an interview that Palestinian 
combatants who always confront compromising plans, follow the 
path of Imam Khomeyni and will continue their struggle until the 
freedom of the Holy Qods. The role the Islamic revolution of 
Iran plays in countering the Zionist conspiracies has caused the 
world arrogance to adopt anti-Iran stands, he noted. 
  Muslim nations today, under the auspices of Imam Khomeyni's 
teachings, have realised that the U.S. and Israel are their 
major enemies, Abu-Musa remarked. He urged Islamic and national 
forces to resist against the U.S. and Israeli conspiracies and 
not let the Zionists rule the region. 
  Abu-Musa said the last Friday's massacre by the Zionist 
forces of Muslim worshippers in al-Khalil [Hebron] was the 
natural consequence of 'Arafat-Rabin agreement.

<F P=106> [By Riyad Mansur in Amman] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] has expressed great appreciation for Jordan's 
official stand toward the Hebron massacre. It said this stand 
reflects the profound link and common destiny between the 
Jordanian and Palestinian peoples. The PFLP also appreciated 
Jordan's decision, along with Syria and Lebanon, to halt the 
negotiations in protest against the massacre of the age. 
  The PFLP held the PLO leadership and Executive Committee, 
led 
by Yasir 'Arafat, responsible for the current status of the 
Palestinian revolution and the PLO itself. It called upon 
'Arafat and the Executive Committee to resign because they are 
unable to assume their national and political responsibilities. 
  PFLP Political Bureau member 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, who has 
frozen his membership in the Executive Committee in protest 
against the Madrid negotiations, has called for forming an 
interim PLO and Palestinian revolution leadership from inside 
and outside the territories. This leadership should be capable 
of ending the deterioration in the PLO's status and the 
Palestinian situation in general. 
  Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B, Malluh said the new leadership 
should be qualified and capable of assuming its national and 
political responsibilities and worthy of being entrusted with 
the rights and national cause of the Palestinian people, 
primarily their right to repatriation, self-determination, and 
independent statehood. [passage omitted] 
  Malluh strongly rejected the attempts of Rabin and his 
government to confine international protection of our people to 
Gaza and Jericho and to be supervised by civil observers. He 
said: We want full international protection by deploying a 
sufficient number of troops that can prevent a repetition of the 
daily massacres committed by the occupation authorities. 
  Malluh welcomed the return of Fatah's hawks and panthers to 
armed struggle against the occupation authorities and settlers. 
[passage omitted] 
  Malluh condemned U.S. policy that is biased toward Israel, 
calling for exposing it because it paves the way for further 
massacres against our people and sheds light on the true U.S. 
position toward our people's national rights. He urged those 
who have illusions about -- or wager on -- the U.S. position to 
drop their illusions and wagers. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's 
attempts to return the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] to the PLO Executive Committee have been 
deadlocked. 
  The PLO leadership's attempts to return those who left the 
committee in protest against the Palestinian-Israeli agreement 
were made by Sulayman al-Najjab, Palestinian People's Party 
representative at the Executive Committee, 10 days after the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. They coincided the efforts being 
exerted in Israel, Washington, Tunis, and Cairo to rescue the 
peace process. 
  The PFLP and DFLP expressed a desire to return to the PLO 
Executive Committee on condition that the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements are canceled and the negotiations are conducted 
according to international legitimacy's resolutions. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PFLP Political Bureau member, who 
represented the front in the Executive Committee before 
resigning in protest against the peace talks, paid tribute to 
al-Najjab's efforts to return the resigning committee members 
and appreciated his care for Palestinian institutions and his 
objection to the Cairo agreement. 
  Malluh told SAWT AL-SHA'B that he emphasized to al-Najjab 
that he refuses to distinguish between the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements because the latter was an honest translation of the 
former. He said his front does not understand the current 
attempts to distinguish between the two as if they were 
different things. He said his return to the PLO Executive 
Committee is conditional on a commitment by the negotiators to 
reconsider all past policies, particularly the cancellation of 
the Oslo and Cairo agreements, and the presentation of 
guarantees to do so. 
  He pointed out that meetings [not further identified] sought 
to discuss the best ways by which the Executive Committee 
members, in their capacity as legitimate representatives elected 
by the Palestine National Council, can confront the state of 
deterioration being experienced by PLO institutions and the 
dangers surrounding the Palestine question and the PLO, 
considering the organization the Palestinian people's political 
entity and unified framework. 
  Malluh admitted that nothing has thus far emerged from these 
meetings despite the sense of national and political 
responsibility demonstrated by the Executive Committee members 
toward the serious situation of the Palestine question and 
toward re-adherence to the PLO's program, the program of return 
and self-determination. 
  Regarding the possibility of re-forming the Executive 
Committee, he said: We have to note the stands of the Committee 
members. These stands are mixed; some members accept the Oslo 
agreement and reject the Cairo agreement. 
  Asked if he would withdraw his resignation from the PLO 
Executive Committee to secure a majority that could bring about 
a coup, he said that, based on the members' position on the 
overall political process, it is still premature to expect a 
white coup in the Executive Committee. He added: A white coup 
needs to be studied. The issue is not one of a coup in the full 
sense of the word; it is the issue of safeguarding the 
Palestinian people's national interests and protecting the PLO 
from the concessions made by the negotiating team.

  [Excerpt] Damascus -- The Alliance of Palestinian Forces 
[APF] held a rally at the al-Nujum cinema in al-Yarmuk refugee 
camp to commemorate the martyrs of the massacre of the blessed 
Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron one week after they were martyred. 
  The rally was attended by 'Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant 
secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP]; 'Umar al-Shihabi, Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command Political Bureau member; 
and representatives from the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, 
the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist Party, the Islamic Jihad 
Movement, Hamas, the PFLP, the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, al-Sa'iqah, and Fatah-the Uprising. 
  The rally was also attended by representatives of the Arab 
liberation movements in Syria, Palestinian nationalist figures, 
and a large crowd. 
  Abu-'Ali Mustafa delivered a speech on behalf of the APF at 
the rally in which he condemned the unforgivable reprehensible 
crime and stressed that the Palestinian people will pursue the 
struggle until victory. He said that the crime which spread 
from the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque to the Galilee, the Negev, 
Gaza, and Nazareth did not come as a surprise to our people. 
The evil Zionist enemy commits dozens of crimes against our 
Palestinian people daily. He added: Some say that the crime 
has come as a result of the rashness of a person in Hebron. We 
say that this crime is not the first and will not be the last in 
the Zionists history that is replete with crimes and that Israel 
is responsible for it. 
  Abu-'Ali Mustafa added: If the Israeli enemy says that it 
was 
a psychopath who killed the defenseless people in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque, then who are the psychopaths who daily attack the people 
of Palestine in Janin, Nabulus, Gaza, and Jerusalem? Is he the 
psychopath who attacked al-Aqsa mosque and southern Lebanon? He 
said that our people will fight until they attain victory. Our 
people will fight with faith and patience in spite of all the 
hardships, and Palestine will remain Arab in spite of them, and 
we will fight with all that we have, and the intifadah continues 
and rages in all places. We pledge to our martyrs that we will 
continue to fight until we score victory. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Palestinian sources in Amman have denied having 
any knowledge about attempts in the occupied Palestinian 
territories to collect a million Palestinian signatures for a 
petition asking President Yasir 'Arafat to withdraw from the 
negotiations with Israel and to resume the armed struggle to 
liberate the occupied territories. 
  The sources told AL-DUSTUR that Fatah and the Palestinian 
Democratic Party have adopted a common stand that is being 
enhanced and which affirms that the resumption of the 
negotiations requires suspending settlement activities, finding 
the appropriate monitoring means, divesting the settlers of 
their weapons, expediting the discussion of the issue of 
settlements, and dismantling settlements that are direct hotbeds 
of tension. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Artur K. Vogel in Tunis: "'Arafat Increasingly </F>
Under Pressure From PLO Grass Roots"] 
  [Text] When PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat convened a meeting 
of the PLO Executive Committee after the massacre in Hebron, 
only eight of 18 members came to Tunis. From Amman Sulayman 
al-Najab, secretary general of the formerly communist 
"Palestinian People's Party," let it be known that the Executive 
Committee had "not achieved a quorum" and was incapable of 
coming to a decision. 
  Previously, al-Najab had been one of the advocates of the 
Oslo agreement, even though he was not one of the closest 
friends of 'Arafat's, whose leadership style he increasingly 
disapproved of. He finally distanced himself from 'Arafat when 
the PLO chairman initialed an interim agreement with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo on 10 February. The 
formula, which 'Arafat agreed to at that time -- special 
protection of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, in 
return for Israeli-Palestinian control of the border-checkpoints 
between Jericho and Jordan as well as Gaza and Egypt -- "means a 
new prison for Palestinians," al-Najab told DER STANDARD. 
  However, 'Arafat has not just lost followers. Some of his 
former critics have jointed him in these difficult days. One of 
them is "Foreign Minister" Faruq Qaddumi. In December he had 
listed the weaknesses of the Oslo agreement. Now he fully 
supports his chief. 
  Marwan Kanathani, 'Arafat's press spokesman, says that there 
is a certain temptation for his boss to stop the negotiations: 
"If 'Arafat were to say that this entire damned process is 
over, he would become absolutely the most popular person among 
the Arabs again." And "if 'Arafat were to feel that he is 
losing control over the PLO leadership and the Palestinian 
people, he will do everything to remain in power. This includes 
a freezing of the peace process."

  [Text] The massacre in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, 
committed by a group of Zionist settlers against worshipers and 
the subsequent escalation of undeterred suppression and killing 
of Palestinian citizens by the Israeli settlers and forces, 
emphasized the futility of Israeli authorities' allegations 
about the possibility of adopting measures that restrain--and we 
do not say stop--the settlers' recklessness. 
  The full right given to the settlers by the Israeli 
authorities to possess weapons and open fire at Palestinian 
civilians whenever they are able to do so makes these 
authorities officially responsible for all crimes and organized 
killing of Palestinian citizens in the occupied territories. 
  The international consensus to denounce the crime and 
condemn 
its perpetrators and the influential officials within the 
Israeli leadership who stand behind them showed--though with 
different degrees, that securing international protection for 
the Palestinian people under occupation has become a pressing 
subject which needs urgent and immediate measures to deter the 
unrestrained Zionist violence. The Zionist violence is 
threatening--now more than ever-- to torpedo the peace process. 
Peace cannot be realized in the absence of a reasonable degree 
of security and peace. The Palestinian people, who have been 
and are still the victims of Zionist massacres and the 
continuation of the Zionist occupation of their homeland, have 
the right to live in peace and to enjoy all their human and 
national rights away from terrorism and the weapons and 
repressive practices of the Israeli occupation. 
  The legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, as called 
for by the international norms and charters on human rights in 
times of war, require relentless efforts by all international 
forces concerned with peace to realize these rights. They 
should not be satisfied with acquainting themselves with 
observers reports that reject Israeli violations of these 
rights. The world was already acquainted with many of these 
violations, which are increasing daily as as a result of the 
absence of any international deterrence and because 
international legitimacy does not carry out its duties, does not 
shoulder its responsibilities, and does not apply a single 
yardstick toward the peoples' causes. 
  It a time for action because the explosive situation in 
occupied Palestine requires a serious position from the 
international community and the United States, in particular--a 
position which contributes to dissipating the imminent Zionist 
danger that exposes the whole peace process to deterioration and 
setback. 
  The United States has announced more than once its eagerness 
to render the peace process successful--the process for which 
the United States is the main sponsor. The United States has 
repeated this positions scores of times. So can the United 
States prove the credibility of its ideas by forcing the Israeli 
Government to accept practical measures that secure 
international protection for the Palestinian people? The United 
States should be aware that the Hebron massacre has not only 
exposed the falsity of Israel's eagerness to realize peace, but 
has also revealed the dangerousness of the continuation of this 
situation--we mean the continuation of occupation and the 
continuation of settlements and settlers. This question does 
not go along with the peace process, peace spirit, and the 
efforts to establish peace. 
  It is time for the United States to be aware that this stage 
requires adding deeds to words, keeping away from ambiguity, and 
resorting to clarity of positions--as they are and as they 
should be--active positions against crimes, terrorism, and 
occupation that deter the killers, provide protection for the 
Palestinian people, and keep the road to peace open until its 
noble objectives are realized.

  [Text] Brothers: Amid the upheaval that resulted from 
shedding Palestinian blood in the Ibrahimi Mosque, we find space 
for tranquility, room for thinking, planning, and action with 
the least losses in terms of our sincere feelings that are 
coupled with righteous indignation, and without any (?unchecked)

  As Palestinians, aware of our pains and the paths of our 
hopes, we, who are continuing to bleed, hope to transform the 
Hebron horror into action, provided we do so in calmness and 
with the firm heart of the warrior engulfed by burning fire, 
exactly as we ourselves are engulfed. 
  We are aware that the Hebron massacre is one of the bricks 
with which Israel was built; a foundation made of massacres such 
as Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, the holy al-Aqsa Mosque, and others. 
As Palestinians, we are aware of the monster residing in the 
Israeli mind. Therefore, we must -- more than anyone else -- 
make the Hebron Massacre the last massacre. We must hold a 
sharp sword to cut off the head of this Israeli monster. This 
can be realized by adhering to two interconnected conditions: 
the first is national unity; and second, unity of aims. Let us 
now ask what we exactly want in terms of dues from the Israeli 
enemy and the international legitimacy following the Hebron 
massacre. 
  For its part, the PLO, and in a proper international 
climate, 
presented its terms and said: Negotiations are suspended until 
an international response to our just demand for protecting our 
people is forthcoming and until Israel submits to our people's 
right to live securely without any harm and without the evils of 
the Israeli occupation. This can be realized by placing the 
fate of the settlements at the head of the agenda of 
negotiations. 
  Therefore, the PLO's aim is clear and aboveboard. It is an 
aim that is commensurate with the peace option and at the same 
time does not deviate from the slogans of the Palestinian 
national struggle but rather gives it a realistic and practical 
push forward as reflected by this all-out international support. 
  Now what do the forces of rejection in Damascus want? What 
do they want after the Hebron massacre? In short what is their 
aim? They are vowing three times [reference to Muslim decision 
to divorce a wife] to divorce the peace option. They adhere to 
the slogans of the Palestinian national struggle. They are 
solidifying like fossils inside these slogans, which reflects 
the current collapse and disintegration. In short, while they 
cannot stand the peace option, they have no alternative. They 
have been like this since they spread themselves out and assumed 
the garb of the opposition. Does this mean that there is a 
crack in the Palestinian national unity, that is, conflicting 
aims and disintegration? 
  If we stick to the idea of room for tranquility, which we 
established at the beginning of this talk, we find that no one 
Palestinian will be able to outrun his Palestinian brother in 
his righteous indignation against the Hebron massacre. The 
feelings are the same although they take various forms. 
However, what is more important is the Palestinian stand on the 
causes and not only the results of the Hebron massacre. The 
Palestinian people have never abandoned their unity under the 
PLO banner in their rejection of Israel's unlawful existence and 
settlements on the land of the Palestinian state, an existence 
which is the primary cause of the Hebron massacre. 
  In principle, we are united under the PLO banner in 
rejecting 
the Israeli settlers' existence. This was our stand before the 
Hebron massacre and will remain our stand until the removal of 
the settlements which constitute the big obstacle on the path of 
negotiations and peace. They are the time bombs which threaten 
to explode in a very dangerous manner. 
  Palestinian national unity and the unity of aims cannot be 
undermined as the Israeli enemy hopes. In the blood, amid the 
fire, and in the heart of the storm and its dust, our unified 
and united people clearly see and are fully aware of how to deal 
with big events. The Hebron massacre, grave as it is, and with 
the challenges that it imposes on us, gives us more than just a 
vista of hope. This is the characteristic of the martyrs blood. 
This blood gives light. It does not extinguish our fire and 
does not disintegrate. Let the short-sighted ones understand 
and desist.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday held a 
telephone conversation with PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat. This was 
the two men's second telephone conversation in two days. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the talk 
was held following a consultation held at the prime minister's 
office, in which an effort was made to draft answers to the 
PLO's queries, which had been presented as a precondition for 
renewing the negotiations. 
  Our correspondent adds that the appropriate conditions for 
resuming the negotiations have not been created as yet, but 
there is satisfaction in Jerusalem about the renewal of a direct 
link with the PLO. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Text] The resolution about to be endorsed by the UN 
Security Council is one the PLO has been anticipating. The 
issue of Jerusalem -- namely, the clause which applies the 
Geneva Convention to the territories, including Jerusalem -- is 
the most crucial article of that resolution. Israel objects to 
the clause, but it is expected to be endorsed nevertheless, 
since the United States will probably abstain on this clause, 
rather than veto it. 
  The resolution denouncing the Hebron massacre, which the 
Security Council will debate tonight, will pave the way for 
renewing the negotiations. Political sources in Jerusalem have 
said that the clause incorporating Jerusalem in the territories 
is an achievement for the Palestinians, and within a few days, 
it will pave the way to direct contacts toward the resumption of 
negotiations. The contacts will address the steps Israel is to 
take in the wake of the Hebron massacre to secure the PLO return 
to the negotiations. 
  For Israel, the Jerusalem clause is disagreeable, but it is 
neither new nor very significant. It is disagreeable, but not 
tragic, Foreign Ministry sources said. 
  Last night, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held his second 
telephone conversation with Yasir 'Arafat in two days. Rabin 
told 'Arafat that Israel will not accept all the demands 'Arafat 
had conveyed to political adviser Jacques Neriya as a condition 
for resuming the negotiations. Rabin urged 'Arafat to return to 
the negotiating table. 'Arafat replied: Not yet. It is 
believed that after the UN Security Council passes a denouncing 
resolution, a senior-level meeting -- probably between Peres and 
Mahmud 'Abbas, possibly between Rabin and 'Arafat -- will be 
held within a few days, heralding the delegations' return to 
intensive talks on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>
  [Excerpt] In telephone conversations with the PLO 
yesterday, Israel suggested a summit meeting between Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and a senior Palestinian figure, at which 
the PLO's requests made in the wake of the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre would be discussed in an effort to resume 
the peace process. 
  It is believed in Jerusalem that the Palestinian reply will 
be received in the coming days, but not before the UN Security 
Council passes a resolution on the massacre. The PLO hopes the 
Council will endorse some of its demands concerning the safety 
of territories Palestinians. Several telephone conversations 
were held yesterday between Jerusalem and PLO-Tunis and between 
Jerusalem and the U.S. and Egyptian foreign ministries. 
  In addition, two meetings were held in Jerusalem regarding 
Israel's replies to the PLO demands made in the wake of the 
Hebron massacre as presented in Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with 
Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser, in Cairo 
on 7 March. 
  The first meeting was a private conversation between Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Minister Peres. The second meeting 
was also attended by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, his deputy, 
Amnon Shahaq, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planning Branch Chief 
'Uzi Dayan, Jacques Neriya, and Foreign Ministry Director 
General Uri Savir. This forum had also met on the night of 6 
March, when it drafted the guidelines for Neriya's Cairo mission. 
  It was stated at yesterday's consultation that 'Arafat had 
presented reduced demands in his meeting with Neriya. For 
instance, the PLO demand to prohibit settlers from carrying arms 
throughout the territories was replaced by a demand that the 
settlers should be permitted to carry arms only inside the 
settlements; instead of the demand to deploy an armed 
international force throughout the territories, the updated 
demand was that an unarmed force should be deployed in Gaza, 
Jericho, and Hebron. (Israel is willing to accept an unarmed 
international force in Gaza and Jericho in accordance with the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP].) 
  The Palestinians demanded that Israel adhere verbatim to the 
DOP, withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and Jericho no later than 
13 April 1994, even if the PLO-Israeli withdrawal accord is not 
finalized by that date. The Palestinians further demanded -- 
contrary to the DOP -- that the talks on settlements, including 
Hebron, be launched immediately after the withdrawal. 
  Contrary to the agreement reached in the 'Arafat-Neriya 
meeting that an Israeli envoy would convey the Israeli replies 
to Tunis, it was decided in yesterday's consultations at the 
prime minister's bureau in Jerusalem that no such envoy would be 
dispatched. The replies were communicated via the telephone. 
It was decided to propose to the Palestinians to hold a summit 
meeting between Minister Peres and a senior Palestinian figure. 
No PLO response was received yesterday. 
  Also yesterday, Peres met in his Jerusalem bureau with seven 
Palestinian journalists representing five East Jerusalem 
newspapers: AL-QUDS, AL-NAHAR, AL-TALI'AH, AL-MANAR, and THE 
JERUSALEM TIMES. Three days ago Peres was interviewed by MBC, 
the Saudi television network. In yesterday's meeting, Peres 
said that with the implementation of the DOP, Israel and the 
Palestinians could establish a new reality. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 4 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Popular, Student Demonstrations Condemn Hebron Massacre 
  2. Lawyers Association, Professional Unions Urge Boycott, 
Reject 
  Normalization 
  3. Information Says IDF Chiefs Preplanned Massacre 
  4. Islamic Group Claims Operations To Avenge Massacre 
  5. Party Secretary Expects Islamic Victory Against 
Injustice, 
  Rulers' Corruption 
<H5>  POPULAR, STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS CONDEMN HEBRON MASSACRE </H5>
  The 4 March edition of AL-SHA'B, mouthpiece of the 
opposition 
Labor Party, is almost entirely devoted to local reaction to the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  A 1,000-word report on page 1 by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il and 
Mu'tazz al-Hadidi gives a detailed account of the "massive 
demonstration" involving tens of thousands of members of the 
Islamic current in al-Tahrir Square in central Cairo on 3 March. 
The report notes that demonstrators burned the Israeli flag, 
condemned the "Zionists," called on the government to expel the 
Israeli ambassador, close the Embassy, and abrogate the Camp 
David Accord, and urged Arab rulers to stop dealing with 
"Zionists." The report also notes that demonstrators hurled 
stones at the police, who were ordered to "fire live and rubber 
bullets and tear gas to disperse demonstrators." The security 
forces arrested hundreds and attacked citizens brutally with 
clubs, according to the report. 
  Under the headline "Week of Anger in Egypt," a page 2 
feature 
carries several reports on popular and student demonstrations 
and rallies criticizing the "slack Egyptian and Arab official 
stance on the Hebron massacre," and calling for closing the 
"Zionist" embassy. 
  A feature entitled "Revenge on the Zionists Is a pan-Arab 
and 
Islamic Duty" appears on pages 4-5, including more reports of a 
week of demonstrations at the universities of Cairo, Alexandria, 
'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Hulwan and several other reports about 
popular rallies to support the massacre victims and denounce 
such crimes. 
<H5>  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION, PROFESSIONAL UNIONS URGE BOYCOTT, REJECT </H5>
  NORMALIZATION 
  On page 11, the paper publishes a boxed 150-word "statement 
by the Lawyers Association," which calls on Arab and Islamic 
states to "adopt a unified stance and demand international 
protection for the Palestinian people." The statement calls on 
Arab states to withdraw from the peace talks now that the 
incident has uncovered "the aggressive nature of the Israeli 
Government and people and proved that Israel is not serious 
about seeking peace." The statement also appeals to Arab and 
Islamic states to "stand firmly against the normalization 
process with Israel and to stop all kinds of dealings with it." 
  Page 12 features a framed 200-word statement by "The 
coordination Committee of the Egyptian Professional Unions," 
which urges Arab and Islamic states to "maintain the full 
boycott of the usurping Zionist enemy" and "reject all forms of 
normalization." The statement calls on the Egyptian Government 
to "expel the Zionist ambassador and close the embassy of the 
criminal Jews." It calls on the PLO and Arab governments to 
withdraw immediately from the "farcical talks that are led by 
the United States, the major supporter of Zionist terrorism." 
<H5>  INFORMATION SAYS IDF CHIEFS PLANNED MASSACRE </H5>
  A 200-word report by Mahmud Bakri on page 3 cites 
"information" obtained by the paper that Israeli Army chiefs 
planned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
<H5>  ISLAMIC GROUP CLAIMS OPERATIONS TO AVENGE MASSACRE </H5>

  A 100-word report on page 7 cites an Islamic Group statement 
claiming responsibility for detonations in retaliation for the 
Hebron massacre. 

<H3>    PARTY SECRETARY EXPECTS ISLAMIC 
VICTORY AGAINST INJUSTICE, RULERS' CORRUPTION </H3>
  In a 4,000-word article on page 2, Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn writes that the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
is a warning to every Arab and Muslim that "Israel does not 
develop missiles and nuclear bombs to use against Palestinians 
in the territories, but to threaten the Arab nation, 
particularly Egypt, if they dare disobey the orders or raise 
their heads in pride." 
  Addressing the United States, Husayn says: "We will not be 
fooled by your denunciations, even if the Security Council 
issues a strongly worded resolution condemning the enemy (it 
will not do), because words are no longer enough." He warns 
"our corrupt rulers" that the United States will not save them 
if the masses decide to punish and overthrow them, noting that 
popular demonstrations prove that "Egypt will not lead the march 
of capitulation" and that it will continue to be "the fort of 
the Arabs and Muslims." 
  Husayn refutes the view that the world has joined forces 
against Islam and Muslims because, according to him, that view 
prevailed "in the first spell of dizziness after the sudden, 
thunderous collapse of the Soviet bloc." Things are different 
today and will keep changing daily, because yesterday's allies 
of the Western bloc are no longer a bloc, he says. He contends 
that Europe is breaking away from the United States, thus 
speeding up NATO's collapse; that an economic war is raging 
between the United States and Japan; that China is becoming a 
great economic power and enhancing its nuclear power; that India 
is developing militarily and economically; and that Russia will 
not be in chaos forever and that its crises might prompt it to 
take a more hostile attitude toward the United States. He 
concludes that the American dream of power has been shattered. 
  He maintains that of all regions, the Arab region is the one 
surrounded by the Americans, who want to display their might and 
support the Zionist expansionist plan. He attributes this 
desire to God almighty's will ruling that "oil will be an 
Islamic product." Apart from Venezuela, all OPEC states are 
Muslim. Major non-OPEC reserves are in Somalia and the Muslim 
republics that belonged to the Soviet Union. And Chinese oil is 
concentrated in a region inhabited by Muslims, he explains. 
Admitting that oil is a vital strategic product and that 
whoever controls its output can control the world, he says that 
the Islamic states' monopoly of oil can turn them into a very 
influential political power. That is why major states try to 
avert this eventuality. The United States wants to monopolize 
Arab oil to control Europe and Japan's supply and thus subjugate 
these states as it pillages Arab wealth, Husayn claims. With 
oil, we can join the ranks of major states and mobilize billions 
of oppressed people for the Islamic awakening, he says. 
  Claiming the existence of a battle between Islam as a 
religion and civilization and the secularist, materialist West, 
Husayn says that Islam is "the right alternative, maintaining 
the balance between the materialist and the immaterialist and 
providing the solution for all mankind's suffering under Western 
control." 
  Reminding readers of the establishment of the Islamic state 
in Iran and Sudan, of Iraq's "steady development into a regime 
that is fully bound by Islamic shari'ah," and of events in 
Algeria, he says he sees a "belt of struggling Islamic states 
extending from the Arab Maghreb to Sudan and Somalia, then to 
Iraq and Iran, at the core of the Gulf and its oil." He notes 
that the "Islamic states' belt will not relinquish Palestine or 
Jerusalem once it expands." 
  Turning to Egypt, Husayn asserts that the people are 
fighting 
courageously under the Islamic banner. "Despite years of 
misleading campaigns, the youths have proven in their recent 
rallies and demonstrations that they firmly reject plans of 
capitulation to the U.S.-Zionist alliance," he says. He adds: 
"The coming stage will witness an escalation of rejection and 
resistance." 
  Addressing the ruling group, he states that the masses will 
not be deceived by the denunciation of the crime in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He assails the leadership, asking: What 
use is denunciation when it was you who led us to the current 
state? "We will not denounce with statements, but with 
organized action that removes you from your posts so that a new 
faithful, courageous, and clean government can rise and join the 
mujahidin in the Arab and Muslim nation," he says, adding: This 
will happen when we wrestle our right to hold free elections 
that will bring you down.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Over 470 children at al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten 
in al-Qasr town, al-Karak Governorate, did not know that they 
were at the mercy of huge amounts of explosives, bombs, and 
ammunition hidden in their kindergarten. Children were 
terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday 
before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the 
kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn 
that their innocent children could have been killed at any 
moment. 
  Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [as published], the 
security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M. and 'Imad S. [not 
further identified] less than an hour after the two hid large 
quantities of machine guns, weapons, and ammunition in al-Faruq 
Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten is affiliated with the 
Islamic Center Society, which, as is well known, is controlled 
by the Muslim Brotherhood group. 
  Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the 
story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh 
of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for 
involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released. 
  The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the 
mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within 
the mosque building. He was also working at an Education 
Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who 
teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were 
hidden. 
  According to information made available to AL-BILAD, 
'Abd-al-Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He 
then asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the 
latter suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The 
explosives were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the 
imam. The kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten. 
  Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman 
was under close watch by security agencies. After the 
explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were 
closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest 
'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes 
before the call to the evening prayer in al-Yarut village, near 
al-Qasr. 
  From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked 
to 
find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme 
the "Jordanian Afghans" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim 
militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute 
outside Amman. 
  Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves 
moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and 
districts since the security agencies have gained full control 
over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves 
concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are 
controlled by the Islamists. 
  According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of 
the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence 
officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the 
various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a 
large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic 
security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens. 
  Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security 
agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine 
guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom, 
including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite 
sticks were found. 
  Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is 
involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these 
operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between 
the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by 
the same state. 
  The final number of the "Afghans" arrested thus far in the 
bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed 
sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few 
days. 
  AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache 
was discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained 
detailed information from the residents of the area and informed 
sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as 
we have said, one of the major operations planned by the 
Jordanian Afghans. 
  The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is 
that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center 
Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden 
less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of 
children. This means that these children could have been killed 
at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of 
these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the 
townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the 
kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the 
scheme was thoroughly planned. 
  AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked 
was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which 
is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the 
Muslim Brotherhood. 
  Residents of the area have not observed any strong 
connection 
between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions 
of an organizational link between them. 
  In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other 
people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were 
arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures 
are available yet on those arrested. 
  In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a 
plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on 
the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those 
arrested in these cases. 
  It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not 
yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a 
kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they 
think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.

<F P=106> ["Last Station" column by Salih al-Qallab: "Follow the </F>
Example of the Occupied Territory"] 
  [Text] The phenomenon of attacking foreign tourists in the 
wake of every massacre or problem in the occupied territory 
should be fully condemned by all forces and citizens. This 
phenomenon should be dealt with firmly and decisively by the 
security agencies. The reason for this is that any person who 
takes revenge for what happened at the Ibrahimi Mosque by 
stabbing a foreign tourist is harming an innocent human being 
and rendering a service to Israel and Zionist gangs. 
  If those who carry out such attacks knew the extent of 
sympathy the Hebron massacre has evoked in the United States, 
and even Japan, they would definitely feel guilty and come to 
the conclusion that they have unwittingly rendered a service to 
our enemies. When an ordinary citizen in Europe and the United 
States hears that a foreign tourist was stabbed in an Amman 
street, or in any other Arab country, he will be more responsive 
to Zionist propaganda portraying us as killers and terrorists. 
  It is not true that every Westerner is our enemy and 
Israel's 
friend. World public opinion has shifted greatly in favor of 
our cause. The intifadah in the occupied territory has opened 
the eyes of Westerners to the reality of matters in our region. 
European and U.S. citizens are now aware that Zionist 
propaganda is misleading and that Israel is a racist, 
suppressive state. 
  It is totally unacceptable that foreigners and tourists in 
our country should be targets for spontaneous, emotional 
reactions whenever Israel commits a massacre in Palestine. We 
should launch a media campaign using television, radio, and the 
press to warn against these odious actions that harm our cause 
and substantiate Zionist propaganda against us in Western 
nations. 
  Those who regard an attack on an innocent tourist -- whose 
true feelings and sympathies are known only to God -- as a 
heroic act should follow the example of the occupied territory. 
No foreign tourist has ever been attacked in the West Bank and 
Gaza, even when clashes and confrontations are raging, save what 
happens by mistake. This is why the presence of foreign 
journalists and tourists has been utilized in the interest of 
the struggling Palestinian people and against Israel and the 
Israeli troops. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has elicited sorrow and sadness 
not just from those who attacked foreign tourists and others 
they thought were foreign tourists; all our people were deeply 
moved and were in tears over this massacre. However, they 
expressed their sadness and sorrow by staging demonstrations, 
making donations, or praying for the mercy of the martyrs. They 
did not resort to unacceptable reactions, as did those who 
attacked our foreign guests.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
Razi Barqay on 8 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Barqay] You are experiencing hard times. 
  [Rabin] Times are not easy, but that is the way it is, and 
we have to deal with the problems and solve them. 
  [Barqay] Do you fear acts of retaliation? Do you have 
information regarding expected acts of revenge for the Hebron 
massacre? 
  [Rabin] Look, terror groups which were active before may 
have greater motivation to exacerbate their acts following the 
massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Had they been able to 
carry out murderous terror acts even before the events in 
Hebron, they would have done so, because this is their way, this 
is their aim. They want to kill Israelis and the peace process. 
The murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs may have increased 
their motivation. That is why we imposed a closure banning 
entry into the territory of sovereign Israel, including united 
Jerusalem. 
  [Barqay] My question, sir, was whether you have information 
on preparations, new squads, something that.... 
  [Rabin, interrupting] We have reports that there is growing 
motivation for retaliation. Terror organizations have announced 
that they intend to take revenge. In view of this, we are 
getting ready. 
  [Barqay] How long will you keep the residents under closure? 
  [Rabin] We reconsider the closure on a daily basis or every 
few days, in order to determine whether the territory has calmed 
down and the threat diminished. Furthermore, we will not lift 
it all at the same time. The most important factor in our 
considerations is security. 
  [Barqay] The uneasy security situation has led you to try to 
expand the coalition, among other things. Will Tzomet's joining 
the government give the government legitimacy in terms of the 
right wing? 
  [Rabin] I sought to expand the basis of the coalition even 
before the tragic event in Hebron took place. We started 
initial contacts with Tzomet before the Hebron massacre. I 
initiated them, and I will not discuss how they were conducted. 
They did not follow the incident. The same holds true for SHAS 
[Torah Observing Sephardim]. 
  [Barqay] What are the chances of Refa'el Eytan's joining the 
coalition, in view of the opposition from Meretz? 
  [Rabin] I will not deal with speculation. The Labor Bureau 
and caucus approved negotiations with factions that accept the 
government's guidelines and will not dispute agreements we have 
made with the PLO. This opens the door to negotiations with 
SHAS, as well as with Tzomet. 
  [Barqay] Will you summon Eytan and others from Tzomet...? 
  [Rabin, interrupting] He will know when I decide, and not 
from you. 
  [Barqay] Over the past few days, Eytan has made some remarks 
that contradict the government guidelines. 
  [Rabin] That may be. I also heard some cabinet ministers 
making remarks that I do not believe to always be in accordance 
with the government policies. I distinguish remarks from.... 
[pauses] Tzomet and its leader are not in the coalition today; 
therefore, there is no reason for him not to say whatever he 
wants. If and when he joins the coalition, it will be a 
different story. 
  [Barqay] You say that ministers made remarks contradicting 
the government platform and guidelines. Do you mean remarks 
favoring the evacuation of settlers from Hebron? 
  [Rabin] I will not elaborate on this. I would rather speak 
personally to any such minister. In general, I can tell you 
that such things happen. 
  [Barqay] Let me ask you directly: Are you in favor of 
evacuating the settlers from Hebron? 
  [Rabin] I will not answer this. According to the 
Declaration of Principles [DOP], all settlements remain in 
place. On the basis of the negotiations with the PLO, I do not 
have to do this. Hence, this is currently not on the agenda. 
  [Barqay] Personally, do you not think that their being there 
is a provocation? 
  [Rabin] Look, the last time I was prime minister, I 
supported settlement in Qiryat Arba' and opposed settlement in 
the heart of Hebron. The previous government did many things -- 
not only in Hebron but also in other settlements in areas 
densely populated by Palestinians -- to which I opposed. Today, 
we are facing a reality, and our problem is to deal with it. 
The important thing today is to resume the negotiations with 
the PLO as soon as possible. I believe this would be the best 
answer to those who oppose the Cairo agreement and the DOP. 
  [Barqay] We hear that 'Arafat wants to bring in armed 
observers as a precondition for resuming the negotiations. 
  [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you. 
  [Barqay] Do you accept this demand? 
  [Rabin] I do not conduct negotiations with him through you. 
  [Barqay] Can you estimate when the parties will return to 
the negotiating table? Days, weeks, months? 
  [Rabin] I would not like to engage in estimates when I do 
not have data that would justify making such estimates. There 
has been no agreement by the PLO and the Palestinians to resume 
negotiations. 
  [Barqay] Newspaper columnists these days describe you as 
someone who is very uncertain, wavering between the dovish 
attitude of Yosi Sarid and Meretz and the hawkish stands of 
Refa'el Eytan. Do have any second thoughts regarding the 
agreement you made with the PLO? 
  [Rabin] I have no second thoughts. The government and I 
determined stands and the path we will follow. I adhere to 
them. I also want to expand the basis of the coalition in order 
to make their implementation possible. Naturally, in a 
coalition, there is a broad spectrum of stands and attitudes. I 
believe that the government policy -- as expressed in the way 
the peace talks have been conducted -- expresses the line to 
which I adhere. I feel the pain of terror acts. I condemn 
every act of terror, and I hurt twice as much when a loathsome 
Jewish murderer carries out a despicable act. 
  [Barqay] As we speak, the Shamgar inquiry commission is 
beginning its deliberations. We know that you had some 
reservations about setting it up.... 
  [Rabin, interrupting] A commission of inquiry was set up. I 
respect it, and I believe it will shed light on the truth. 
  [Barqay] In view of this, do you not believe the time has 
come for you to appoint a full-time defense minister? 
  [Rabin] Two previous commissions of inquiry -- one set up 
after the Yom Kippur War and one after the war of Lebanon -- 
were established when there was a full-time defense minister. 
Such events take place regardless of whether the post of 
defense minister was separate from that of the prime minister. 
I neither believe this is necessary nor am I in any way 
considering it. 
  [Barqay] You will stay on as defense minister and prime 
minister? 
  [Rabin] Yes. 
  [Barqay] And you have full confidence in Chief of Staff Ehud 
Baraq? 
  [Rabin] I have full confidence in the defense establishment, 
the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and its commanders, the security 
services, and the Border Police. This does not mean that a 
mishap can never happen here or there. I have full confidence 
in the IDF high command, from the chief of staff down, and in 
the Shin Bet men. Regrettably, the public does not know enough 
about the burden the IDF, Shin Bet, the Border Police, and the 
Israel Police are shouldering; neither does it know how many 
terrible things were prevented thanks to their efficient 
activity. I wish to state here: The IDF and the security 
services deserve our every praise. 
  [Barqay] Despite some mishaps here and there? 
  [Rabin] I made my point clear. 
  [Barqay] Mr. Rabin, how will your coalition look in two 
weeks? 
  [Rabin] I will not engage in nor do I have need of 
prophecies. You may need to interview me, but this does not 
compel me to answer every question, especially when things are 
not yet finalized. I will only say definite things when I am 
able to bring them before the Knesset, and then you will know 
them anyway.

the Knesset on 8 March -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic 
subtitles; translated from the Hebrew] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nisan] How will yesterday's 
terror attack against the SLA [South Lebanese Army] soldiers 
affect the status of the SLA and the security zone? 
  [Rabin] We have no intention of letting these incidents go 
unnoticed. We will take steps when we see fit in order to 
prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Those who perpetrated 
the attacks will be punished. 
  [Nisan] Are you now sending signals to those who perpetrated 
the attacks? 
  [Rabin] I am not sending any signals. We are in a state of 
war and not a dialogue with Hizballah and the Palestinian 
rejectionist terror organizations. On the other hand, there is 
no doubt that the Lebanese and Syrian Governments must do their 
share in calming the situation if they ever wish to promote the 
peace process.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee today that the dialogue 
with the PLO on the resumption of the negotiations continues but 
no agreement has yet been reached. According to him, the 
emissaries he sent to Cairo to confer with 'Arafat clarified 
Israel's policy in the aftermath of the massacre, to the effect 
that the negotiations must be accelerated. Our correspondent 
Yo'el Nir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Nir] Referring to the 
contacts with the UN Security Council [UNSC] on passing a 
resolution similar to Resolution 799, adopted in the aftermath 
of the deportation of members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], Prime Minister Rabin said that Israel is perturbed by 
the attempt to include Jerusalem in the definition of occupied 
territories. We are dealing with this issue in cooperation with 
the Americans, he said, but they, too, have encountered 
difficulties in their contacts with other countries. 
  Summing up this chapter, Rabin said he believes the 
Palestinians want to resume the negotiations, but that they 
first want to score some achievement in the Security Council. 
Furthermore, from now on they will make every possible effort 
to raise the question of the safety of the Palestinians in the 
territories in whatever international forum possible, arguing 
that the Jewish settlers are given arms while the Palestinians 
do not possess any. [passage omitted] 
  As for the talk by prominent settlers about a civil 
uprising, 
Rabin said he had asked the legal establishment to deal with the 
issue and is now waiting for them to move their ass, as he put 
it. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 8 March 
carries a related report on Rabin's appearance before the 
committee, adding: "The prime minister noted that the Religious 
Kibbutz Movement would like to either evacuate Netzarim in the 
Gaza Strip or exempt it from paying its outstanding debt for 
property it had purchased. I consulted the finance minister 
about this, and it may very well be that all of Netzarim's 
property will be transferred to the Treasury, Rabin noted. He 
confirmed that inhabitants of Qiryat Arba' had inquired about 
the possibility of getting government aid and housing if they 
leave the place. The Construction and Housing Ministry will 
look into the possibility of helping the applicants on a 
personal basis but not as a policy, the prime minister said." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 8 March 
notes that Rabin told the committee that "IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] officers contend that 1,000 soldiers must be deployed in 
Hebron in order to ensure the safety of the Jewish settlers in 
the city. He defined the situation in Hebron as a time bomb." 
The prime minister went on to say "that at this point, there 
has been no change in policy with regard to the closure. 
Consequently, he will not heed the Palestinians' demands to 
increase the number of worshipers allowed to pray on the Temple 
Mount on 11 March, the last Friday of Ramadan. He added that 
the decision to evacuate Jewish worshipers from the Western Wall 
last Friday was made with his approval. It was a one-time 
decision which does not point to a systematic trend, he said."]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>
  [Excerpts] Today's cabinet meeting, which was held under 
the cloud of a government crisis, addressed an issue which has a 
majority support only in the present cabinet composition. The 
issue was the immediate evacuation of the Jewish settlement of 
Hebron. The Meretz ministers and Ministers Bar'am, Namir, and 
Ben-Eli'ezer were in favor of the evacuation. The cabinet will 
not vote on the issue before next week. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Minister Sarid is working on an alternative 
proposal to be raised if the evacuation idea falls through: 
Rabin and Peres will announce that the future of the centers of 
friction, such as the Jewish settlements in Hebron, Netzarim, 
and Kfar Darom, is to be decided within a few months, rather 
than after the interim period in five years. Sarid stressed 
that any decision on the settlements' future will be a purely 
Israeli decision completely unlinked to the negotiations with 
the Palestinians. 
  Rabin and Peres did not announce their views on the matter, 
although they said last week that they were against such a move. 
Both Minister Tzur and Minister Shetrit were opposed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Also this morning, the cabinet decided to somewhat ease the 
closure on the territories. According to the decision, 4,500 
Arab men and women above the age of 40 will receive permits to 
work in Israel in the coming days. 
  On another matter, Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir 
advised the ministers that several persons, who had applauded 
the Hebron massacre, will be charged with agitation by the end 
of the week. Attorney General Ben-Ya'ir reported legal 
difficulties in outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay.

activists of various right-wing organizations have declared a 
non-violent civil uprising in the wake of reports that most 
cabinet ministers support the evacuation of Jews from Hebron. 
According to our correspondent Gil Litman, they announced the 
upgrading of their opposition to the government's actions to the 
level of a civil uprising, which will be manifested in passive 
resistance to evacuation and other orders.

  [Text] A delegation of Israeli Arabs, led by Knesset 
Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, arrived in Cairo today en 
route to Damascus to extend sympathies to Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad over the death of his son Basil. The delegation met 
with Dr. Usamah al-Baz, President Mubarak's political adviser. 
On the line from Cairo is Qaysar Kabaha, who is accompanying 
the delegation on the visit: 
  [Begin recording] [Kabaha] The 57-strong delegation arrived 
in Cairo at noon today and is expected to proceed to Syria 
tomorrow morning to extend condolences to the Syrian president. 
The team was accorded an official welcome at Cairo 
International Airport. They received special laissez-passers 
valid for one trip to Syria. Knesset members 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah and Talab al-Sani' of the Arab Democratic Party this 
afternoon met with Mr. al-Baz. Darawshah had this to say about 
the session: 
  [Darawshah] Al-Baz sounded upbeat about the possibility of a 
resumption of the PLO-Israeli negotiations. He admitted there 
are real difficulties, but hoped the UN Security Council would 
pass a resolution that would convince the PLO to return to the 
negotiating table. Al-Baz noted, however, that the Israeli 
Government should meet two central demands -- international 
protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories and 
deterrent action against any future settler attacks on the 
Palestinians. He further emphasized that Egypt is engaged in an 
effort to end Israeli-PLO disagreements and relaunch the talks. 
  [Kabaha] Did the prospect of Tzomet joining the Israeli 
Government coalition and the potential results of such a step on 
the Israeli political landscape come up in your meeting with 
al-Baz? 
  [Darawshah] He did not conceal his apprehension, and could 
not see why Rabin wants to have Tzomet in the government. 
Al-Baz said that, in its present lineup and given the 
comfortable majority it commands, the Israeli Government is in a 
position to pursue the peace process. Al-Baz speculated that 
Rabin was likely out to influence certain Israelis and Arabs. 
He sounded really worried about the possible changes in 
Israel's political landscape. 
  [Kabaha] About tomorrow's visit to Syria by the Israeli Arab 
delegation, al-Baz said Egypt attaches high importance to the 
trip. In his recent meetings with al-Asad and Syrian officials, 
al-Baz said he got the impression they were looking forward to 
peace and that peace for Syria was now a strategic option. [end

in Hebron named the victims as 25-year-old Samir Duwayq, and 
22-year-old Wahil al-Natshah. 
  There was also unrest in the Gaza Strip today. An Associated 
Press photographer was lightly wounded by a rubber bullet when 
soldiers dispersed a riot in the Jabalyah refugee camp. Also in 
Jabalyah, an Israeli Army patrol caught 22-year-old 'Amr Ahmad 
Matar, who is suspected of killing 80-year-old Morris Eisenstadt 
on the day of the Hebron massacre. 
  In Bani-Suhaylah, the car of two terrorists who attacked a 
police jeep and slightly wounded a soldier and policeman has 
been found. It was burned out and contained many blood stains 
and bullet holes.

<F P=106> [Report by radio correspondents Qaysar Kabahah and Muhammad </F>
Sharif "from Damascus" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Kabahah] The delegation of Arab Israeli citizens 
started its second day in Syria with a visit to new 
al-Qunaytirah and old al-Qunaytirah, which was destroyed by the 
Israeli Defense Forces during the Yom Kippur War. A large crowd 
of the city's notables, headed by al-Qunaytirah Governor Dr. 
Walid al-Buz, received the delegation. 
  The governor welcomed the delegation at the main reception 
hall in the Governorate Building. He reviewed the geographic 
and living conditions in the two parts of the Golan Heights [the 
Syrian and Israeli-controlled parts]. He also talked about the 
concept of peace from the Syrian viewpoint. 
  [Al-Qunaytirah Governor Walid al-Buz] Syria is working for 
the sake of a just and comprehensive peace. The banners for 
that kind of peace have been raised by the president on several 
occasions. The president has declared that kind of peace as a 
stated policy for Syria and for all the Arabs; the just and 
comprehensive peace on all Arab fronts; the peace that would 
restore rights and return the land; the peace of the brave; the 
peace of the knights; the peace that will give each what is 
rightfully his; the peace that can survive and last; the peace 
that will guarantee the interests of all within the framework of 
international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions, 
particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  [Kabahah] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, Knesset member and head 
of the delegation, delivered a speech thanking the hosts for 
their hospitality and said that peace can only be achieved by 
ending the occupation of all Arab territories occupied in 1967 
and by recognizing the legitimate rights of peoples in the 
region. He also said the desired peace is the peace of the 
brave, as His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has said. 
  [Darawshah] ...the brave that guarantees the recognition of 
rights for all peoples. 
  [Kabahah] The delegation toured neighborhoods in the 
destroyed city. The head of delegation, Darawshah, and Knesset 
member al-Sani' planted a tree at the al-Qunaytirah World 
Visitors Garden on behalf of the delegation. My colleague 
Muhammad Sharif is joining me now and he will talk about the 
Syrian media's focus on the delegation's visit. 
  [Sharif] In fact, the delegation has drawn much of the 
attention of the media, including the radio, television, and 
local and foreign newspapers here in Syria. Journalists are 
accompanying and following the delegation members everywhere. 
The attention they have been given has been prominent on the 
Syrian radio and television. The news of the delegation, as 
well as the interviews with Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah, the head of delegation, and Knesset Member Talab 
al-Sani', have occupied a prominent position in the newscasts. 
The journalists also took interest in their fellow journalists 
and conducted interviews with them. They were keen to ask 
questions about Israeli politics and party affairs. 
  Papers issued here today highlighted the delegation's visit 
on their front pages and published pictures of the delegation 
members. Papers also highlighted the celebrations marking the 8 
March Revolution, which brought the Ba'th Party to power in 
Syrian 33 years ago. They also highlighted the speech President 
Hafiz al-Asad made last night. This was the first speech to be 
made by the president since the death of his son, Basil. 
  Members of the delegation are being received warmly 
everywhere by the Syrian citizens, who are fully aware of the 
delegation's visit and who are following with interest the 
delegation's visits, activities, and meetings. 
  The meetings between some of the delegation members and 
their 
relatives or people from their hometowns who live in Damascus, 
for the first time in over 40 years, were really touching. Many 
Palestinians have flocked to the hotel to inquire about their 
relatives and kinsfolk in their hometowns. 
  [Kabahah] Tomorrow, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is 
expected to meet with the delegation members, who will offer 
condolences on the death of his son, Basil. Other meetings are 
expected to be held with other public figures in Syria. 
  Muhammad Sharif and Qaysar Kabahah from Damascus.

  [Text] The delegation of the 1948 Palestinians [Arabs who 
remained in Palestine following the creation of Israel in 1948] 
led by 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, accompanied by Khalid al-Fahum, 
leader of the Palestinian National Salvation Front, visited the 
liberated city of al-Qunaytirah this morning. The delegation 
saw the remains of the savage destruction wrought by the Israeli 
occupation forces before the heroic town was liberated. 
  The al-Qunaytirah governor briefed the delegation on the 
sacrifices made by the people of the governorate and the Syrian 
Arab people to defend the homeland, the Palestinian cause, and 
the Arab nation's causes. The governor said: Syria is working 
to realize the just and comprehensive peace expounded by 
President Hafiz al-Asad -- the peace of the brave. This will 
restore occupied Arab territories and return rights to their 
owners, based on UN resolutions. The governor also presented 
Mr. Darawshah with the shield of liberated al-Qunaytirah. 
  Replying to the governor's speech, Darawshah said: We are 
pleased to arrive in this governorate, which is a dear part of 
Syria and the Arab nation. We look forward to the bright future 
when this part will be merged with the other side of the 
occupied Golan, which will have to be liberated and returned to 
Syria and the Arab nation. 
  Darawshah conveyed the love of our people in occupied 
Palestine and the Golan to the sons of the Syrian Arab people 
and the wise leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Darawshah said: We bow our heads and pay homage to the 
Syrian people's sacrifices and martyrs for the sake of Palestine 
and the Arab nation. 
  Concluding his speech, Darawshah said: Victory will 
inevitably be realized. Occupied Golan will return to Syria. 
This is the peace we understand, a peace that restores rights 
their owners and ends Israel's occupation of all occupied Arab 
territories. This is the cherished peace as described by 
President Hafiz al-Asad, the peace of the brave. 
  In a statement to the SANA correspondent, Darawshah said: 
The destruction we have seen demonstrates the savagery of the 
occupation. This is a deplorable crime by the occupation 
against al-Qunaytirah. Other acts of aggression and savage 
practices have been carried out in other parts of Arab 
countries, especially inside Palestine. Hundreds of villages 
were destroyed. Thus, the Israeli occupation has added other 
crimes to its series of criminal actions. 
  Darawshah called for Israel's withdrawal from occupied Golan 
and for its return to its Syrian owners so Syrians, under the 
leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, can rebuild 
al-Qunaytirah, return its inhabitants, who were driven out, and 
so it will return to its Syrian mother. 
  Darawshah and his delegation visited the martyrs cemetery, 
placed a wreath on the martyr's monument, and read prayers for 
the martyrs' chaste souls. He wrote an article in the visitors' 
book in which he praised the heroic struggle of the Syrian Armed 
Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in defense of Arab 
territory. Darawshah said: We are certain the darkness of the 
occupation will end and the Israeli occupation will leave 
occupied Syrian Golan and all occupied Arab territories.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Television 
Network in Arabic, in a linkup with Damascus Syrian Arab 
Republic Radio Network in Arabic, at 0902 GMT on 8 March begins 
a live transmission from the Damascus University Auditorium of a 
speech rally on the 31st anniversary of Syria's 8 March 
revolution. 
  At 0905 GMT, ranking Syrian officials enter the hall, led by 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party [ASBP] and President Hafiz al-Asad's 
representative, accompanied by other officials, including Vice 
Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah; 
Sulayman Qaddah, ASBP regional secretary; People's Assembly 
Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah, and Prime Minister Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi. Other ministers and officials are also seated near 
the podium. 
  The rally begins with the observance of one minute of 
silence 
in memory of President al-Asad's late son, Basil, and the Arab 
martyrs. This is followed immediately by the Ba'th anthem. 
  The first to address the rally is Ahmad Abu-Musa, head of 
the 
Ba'th Vanguards Organization, on behalf of popular organizations 
and professional unions. Abu-Musa begins his speech by euloging 
Basil al-Asad and his traits, praising President Hafiz al-Asad's 
patience and forbearance. He says the sympathy with Syria that 
Arabs have shown illustrates the unity of the Arab nation. He 
reviews Syria's political, economic, social, and democratic 
accomplishments under the leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad. 
He adds that the 8 March revolution was the major turning point 
in the history of Syria, which turned from a small state to a 
leading country able to influence Arab and world relations. He 
adds that Syria's credibility has been enhanced by the Geneva 
summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, noting 
that Syria's stand on the peace process is based on adherence to 
Arab rights and international legitimacy and respect for UN 
resolutions. He concludes by saying that Syria's stability, 
national unity, and democratic practice have been enhanced by 
popular organizations. 
  At 0927 GMT, Safwan Qudsi, member of the Progressive 
National 
Front [NPF] Central Command and secretary general of the Arab 
Socialist Union Party, delivers a speech on behalf of the NPF. 
He begins his speech by stressing the importance of historical 
memory, which, he says, shows that Syria has taken large strides 
since the 8 March revolution. He says that under President 
Hafiz al-Asad, new realities have been created, noting that 
Syria before Hafiz al-Asad was not the same as Syria with 
al-Asad. He explains that President al-Asad is a historic 
leader who managed to initiate conspicuous changes in the life 
of Syria. He notes the launching of the al- Asad-led Corrective 
Movement in 1971 has proved the ability of the 8 March 
revolution to rectify its own course and to rid itself of 
ideological rigidity. He notes that this would not have been 
possible if the 8 March revolution had not had a special 
mechanism that allows it to develop itself and to respond to 
challenges and changes. He lavishly praises what he terms 
President Hafiz al-Asad's genius, profound understanding of 
reality, and farsightedness. Turning to Syria's participation 
in the Middle East peace process, he says Syria has shown a 
readiness for political flexibility, but not at the expense of 
basic constants. 
  At 0957 GMT, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar delivers a speech on behalf 
of the ASBP. After conveying the congratulations of President 
Hafiz al-Asad and the ASBP command, al-Ahmar salutes the souls 
of the martyrs of the ASBP and Arab nation and greets the Syrian 
Armed Forces. He then eulogizes Basil al-Asad, noting that his 
loss has shown the Syrian people's rallying around the 
leadership of President Hafiz al-Asad, love for the deceased, 
and strong national unity. He adds that this "ordeal" has also 
proven the strong ties between Syria and Lebanon. 
  He then reviews al-Asad's role in the ASBP's struggle since 
its establishment, noting that thanks to President al-Asad's 
leadership, the 8 March revolution managed to tackle all 
shortcomings in view of his understanding of reality. He says 
the revolution after the Corrective Movement has realized 
achievements everywhere in Syria. He also notes that the 
revolution has stressed the importance of building the 
individual through the spread of education, remarking that the 
revolution has guaranteed education as one of the citizens' 
basic rights. He says that under the Corrective Movement, party 
pluralism was introduced, represented by the establishment in 
1972 of the NPF, which groups a number of parties in Syria, 
including the Ba'th Party. 
  Turning to the country's economic performance, he says that 
"satisfactory" growth rates were achieved in 1993. He notes the 
growth rates of various sectors of the economy. 
  He says Arab unity is a basic ASBP objective. The objective 
of Arab unity, he says, guides the ASBP in all its efforts. He 
says that since the Corrective Movement, President al-Asad has 
been calling for Arab solidarity. 
  Turning to the Middle East peace process, al-Ahmar says this 
process is aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive peace. He 
notes that Syria joined this process on the basis of this 
understanding. He notes that Syria adheres to the Madrid 
formula. Since the Madrid conference, he says, Israel has been 
been trying to hamper the peace process. He adds that Syria has 
confronted Israel's attempts to isolate Syria, and worked to 
enhance coordination among Arab parties to the peace process, 
especially with Lebanon. He says Syria's efforts to confront 
Israel's "maneuvers" were crowned by the Geneva summit, which 
emphasized the principles of the solution and the Madrid 
formula. He stresses that Syria will not relinquish one inch of 
the Golan or other occupied Arab territories. 
  At 1045 GMT, al-Ahmar turns to the international scene, 
noting that the world will not stabilize unless racism, double 
standards, and aggressive tendencies are removed. 
  Al-Ahmar concludes his speech at 1050 GMT. Immediately 
afterward, the speech rally concludes with the Syrian national 
anthem. Live transmission ends at 1052 GMT.

<F P=106> [Speech by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant secretary general </F>
of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and President Hafiz al-Asad's 
representative, at a speech rally marking the 31st anniversary 
of the 8 March revolution in Damascus--live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On this glorious occasion, 
the 31st anniversary of the 8 March revolution, I am honored and 
pleased to represent the secretary general of the Arab Socialist 
Ba'th Party [ASBP], struggler President Hafiz al-Asad 
[applause], and to congratulate you and all our struggling Arab 
nation's masses. I am honored to convey to you and through you 
to all strugglers of our great party and all Arab strugglers 
wherever they are, the congratulations of the leader of the 
victorious march of party and people, comrade struggler 
President Hafiz al-Asad [applause], secretary general of the 
ASBP and president of the Syrian Arab Republic. I also convey 
his greetings and wishes for further success in our steady 
militant march toward the achievement of the objectives of the 
party and masses, represented by unity, freedom, and socialism 
[applause]. I also convey to you the congratulations of the 
command of our great party, the initiator and leader of the 
revolution, and its greetings and warm wishes on this cherished 
occasion. [passage omitted] 
  A simple comparison between Syria now and Syria before the 
revolution provides clear evidence of the great miracle that the 
revolution has achieved after the Corrective Movement and under 
the leadership and guidance of great leader Hafiz al-Asad 
[applause]. Achievements surround us everywhere we look, and 
they are constantly increasing, complementing each other in 
quality and quantity. These achievements speak for themselves, 
and show that the Syria of the revolution, the Syria of al-Asad, 
is no longer a backward, marginal country, but a modern state 
and a society that is firmly proceeding toward further progress 
and prosperity. [passage omitted] 
  All this has established a solid basis for political 
stability and security that is considered an exception in a 
tense region and a turbulent world that has recently been shaken 
by major events. This stability has contributed to the 
consolidation of a major, ambitious development process within 
the framework of a multi-sector economic system based on 
cooperation and participation within the state's plan. This 
plan is aimed at ensuring the country's progress and advancement 
within the instructions of the ASBP to build a new society. It 
will be a society based on equality and the eradication of 
exploitation, poverty, illiteracy, and diseases by improving the 
people's living standards and by increasing the state's 
capabilities on the basis of self-reliance. In this brief 
address, we cannot cover all of last year's indications of 
growth. However, we will run through some of them to show the 
continuity of the battle for an advanced society. Comrades, we 
notice that in less than one year the production and 
distribution of electricity has stabilized. This has been a 
great qualitative success that could not have been realized had 
it not been for the direct instructions of the leader of the 
homeland, comrade struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause]. 
Last year's economic growth rates registered satisfactory 
figures and showed steady development in qualitative and 
quantitative progress. 
  If we take the gross national production [GNP] as the most 
comprehensive indication, we find that in comparison with 1992, 
the GNP grew at a rate of 17.5 percent in 1993 in current 
prices. This growth rate becomes 10 percent if it is measured 
with fixed prices. This is a high and satisfactory rate. In 
the same context, all sectors have registered good growth rates. 
The agricultural sector has registered a growth rate of 17 
percent, which signifies the importance of the revolution's 
strategy promoting the agricultural sector through enhancing the 
process of building the infrastructure of this sector and 
applying appropriate pricing policies that do justice to the 
human effort and encourage production. 
  As for the mineral and manufacturing industries sector, a 
growth rate of 4 percent has been registered. The service 
sector registered a growth rate of 22 percent. This helps raise 
citizens' living standards through the various general services 
that are offered to them for free. Among the very positive 
phenomena that has been noted has been the rise in total 
investment capital by approximately 9 percent. This capital's 
contribution to the GNP has risen from 7 percent, versus 93 
percent of the final consumption, in 1992 to 13 percent, versus 
87 percent of the final consumption, in 1993. In view of the 
measures that have been taken to boost economic plurality, 
promote individual initiatives, and encourage citizens to invest 
their funds in economic activities, total private capital has 
risen from 57 billion Syrian pounds in 1992 to 86 billion Syrian 
pounds in 1993. Perhaps what was most conspicuous last year was 
the increase in goods production, which constitutes a source of 
market value in the economy. Improvements in the mechanisms and 
volume of economic trade with the world have taken place. 
Positive qualitative developments have taken place through the 
codification of economic cooperation with some sisterly 
countries, such as Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Stable and 
developed formulas for this cooperation have been agreed upon. 
This cooperation falls within the framework of a comprehensive 
economic Arab integration, which is in the interest of all Arabs. 
  But, the major changes and achievements under the revolution 
in all sectors and throughout Syria and its governorates do not 
constitute the final picture of what we plan to achieve. Nor do 
they represent all our aspirations. Rather, they are steps 
along the road ahead of us within the limits of available 
resources. They provide an incentive for continuing the process 
of work and construction to arrive at our final goals. The past 
few years have not been void of difficulties. Throughout the 
years of the revolution, we have faced difficulties and 
obstacles of various types. We have managed to overcome many of 
them, and we will overcome all difficulties that will face us in 
the future. We are optimistic and hopeful. We are determined 
and resolved to continue the march until we arrive at our 
pan-Arab objectives and defeat all the obstacles along this road. 
  Comrades, brother citizens: The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party 
believes that the Arabs have no existence outside their pan-Arab 
entity. It is a pan-Arab party in ideology, practice, and 
organization. This is why it has put unity at the head of its 
objectives and given it first priority, considering it the most 
sublime objective of the contemporary struggle and the common 
denominator of all Arabs. All the events and developments on 
the pan-Arab and world level prove that the Arabs will never be 
able to play their role in full in the march of world 
civilization unless they are able to achieve comprehensive 
unity. Unity is one of their rights as a nation. It is also 
their duty as messengers of a humanitarian civilization that has 
lit the darkness of history at several stages. 
  Comrades, the March Revolution took the objective of unity 
as 
a model that guides all its actions in the pan-Arab arena. 
Since the Corrective Movement, the hero of the Corrective 
Movement, leader struggler President Hafiz al-Asad [applause] 
has been exerting every effort to urge the Arabs to close their 
ranks and to entrench their solidarity, even at its minimum 
level, especially since Arab solidarity reduces the possibility 
for pan-Arab tragedies such as the Iraq-Iran war, the Iraqi 
regime's occupation of Kuwait, and other tragedies and crises. 
Solidarity enables the Arabs to achieve their transitional 
objectives, liberate their land, restore their rights, and 
reinforce their position in the world. Arab solidarity also 
creates a positive atmosphere that paves the way for the 
promotion of comprehensive cooperation among Arabs, that allows 
them to make large strides toward their comprehensive unity, and 
that allows the establishment of unity between two or more of 
the Arab states that are ready to do so. 
  The Yemeni unity experiment has delighted the Arabs who 
aspire for unity. However, the difficulties and crises that 
have recently afflicted this unity have created a wave of 
frustration and pain for the sons of the Yemeni people and for 
all Arabs. They have all called on the Yemeni leadership to 
work to overcome the current crisis, reactivate joint 
institutions, entrench democracy, and to meet the people's 
demands to safeguard unity and bolster its march. [passage 
omitted] 
  O comrades; O brothers; O masses of our militant nation: 
Since its inception, the Ba'th Party has been known as 
Palestine's party. Likewise, since its inception, the 
revolution has viewed the Arab-Zionist conflict as a top 
priority, given that it is the paramount issue concerning all 
Arabs, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Gulf. Syria has 
been making dear sacrifices and spending a great deal of its 
revenue to confront the continuous Israeli aggression, defend 
the Arabs' pan-Arab rights, and liberate their occupied 
territories. It is working with all fraternal Arabs to mobilize 
their potential and unify their positions to settle the conflict 
in a manner that will ensure the restoration of Arab territories 
and rights, and that will also result in a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region--a decent and honorable peace 
that will be enjoyed by all, and that will allow the countries 
and peoples of the region to live free from aggressions, 
expansionist policies, and domination. 
  Thanks to this pan-Arab understanding of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, Syria's pan-Arab role has grown immensely. Syria now 
speaks on behalf of all Arabs. As for its leader, struggler 
President Hafiz al-Asad, [applause] he is meeting the leaders of 
the big powers on behalf of all Arabs. Likewise, they hold 
talks with him in this capacity. This confirms that Syria's 
pan-Arab role now enjoys the recognition of everyone in the 
region and the world at large. 
  The peace process was unleashed more than two years ago to 
serve as a vehicle to achieve a clear objective, namely, a 
comprehensive and just peace that will return the territories 
and rights to their Arab owners and consecrate security and 
stability in the region. Syria has taken part in this process on 
the basis of this formula. Syria's participation was 
instrumental in paving the way for the peace process. Under no 
circumstances will Syria accept any distortion of the Madrid 
formula, or any deviation from this formula. This is because it 
is impossible to achieve peace unless it is based on the 
essence, foundations, principles, and objectives of this 
process, which constitute an embodiment of international 
legitimacy. The honoring of the essence, foundations, 
principles, and objectives of this process must result in the 
implementation of the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  Since the convocation of the Madrid conference, Israel, 
which 
was compelled to enter the peace process in the first place, has 
used various means to obstruct this process. That is why it 
decided to torpedo it from within. It has made several attempts 
to achieve this objective. It started with procrastination, 
with a failure to discuss substantive issues, and with an 
attempt to render the Washington talks devoid of any meaningful 
content to turn them into a marginal and insignificant parley in 
the hope that it will buy time to promote its expansionist 
objectives. 
  Faced with these attempts, Syria has underlined its 
adherence 
to the principles and bases of the peace process. Similarly, it 
has underscored coordination with the Arab sides, given that 
this coordination is conducive to Arab strength and cohesion. 
This time, Israel sought to strike at inter-Arab coordination 
and weaken the Arab sides by dealing with them one at a time and 
offering them fragile, separate, and partial solutions, which 
are designed to achieve Israel's expansionist ambitions, 
circumvent the bases of the peace process, and wriggle out of 
its obligations as enshrined in the relevant international 
resolutions, as the course of events has shown. 
  Nonetheless, Syria has confronted Israel's attempts to deal 
with the Arab sides one at a time and isolate Syria in 
preparation for nullifying its pioneering pan-Arab role in the 
peace process. It is true that Israel has managed to conclude a 
unilateral deal with the Palestinians. However, Syria has 
striven to enhance coordination with the Arab parties to the 
Washington talks, particularly fraternal Lebanon, because 
coordination and joint action are necessary if the Arabs are to 
regain their rights. 
  Syria's efforts in confronting the Israeli maneuvers were 
crowned with great success. This was clearly manifested in the 
Geneva summit between struggler President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. 
President Clinton. Observers were unanimous in describing this 
summit as the most important event in both the Middle East and 
the international arenas, saying it was a summit between the 
leader of a great nation, the Arab nation, and the leader of the 
most powerful state in the world. It was the summit between 
equals and the summit that restated Arab rights and Arab 
constants. The summit effectively reconfirmed that the 
solution, a just and comprehensive peace, must be based on the 
Madrid formula and the implementation of international 
legitimacy resolutions 242, 338, and 425. In Geneva, President 
al-Asad said: I do not differentiate between the Golan and 
southern Lebanon, between what is occupied from Palestine or 
Jordan. When I ask for one part I ask for the whole. This is 
elementary because, to me, they all constitute the same Arab 
land. 
  Within this pan-Arab concept lies the secret of the success 
of his Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and the failure of 
separate solutions to settle the conflict. Faced with this 
success scored by Syria's pan-Arab policy, Israel found itself 
cornered and unable to maneuver. That's why it carried out a 
concentrated media campaign before and after the Geneva summit 
to minimize the importance of this summit and to try to 
marginalize its results. It did so in an attempt to obstruct 
the peace process and hamper the U.S. role, which moved, though 
a bit late, to push the peace process ahead and render it a 
success after the Geneva summit. After the failure of all these 
attempts, Israel returned to its aggressive nature. It 
escalated its systematic terrorist operations, starting with the 
escalation of its operations in southern Lebanon. It then 
perpetrated its odious crime in the blessed Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron, a crime that is unequaled in atrocity, ugliness, and the 
flouting of human values and international laws and norms. 
  This crime brings back to mind the picture of Israeli 
terrorism in all its vilest forms, particularly since Israel's 
stamp appeared in another terrorist crime, the explosion at the 
Sayyidat al-Najah in Beirut, simply to divert the world's 
attention from the Ibrahimi mosque crime and to try to return 
Lebanon to a whirlpool of violence and internecine fighting. 
  The international reaction to these Israeli crimes has not 
gone beyond condemnation. In order to tackle these actions and 
confront Israel's scorn for human life, the condemnations and 
denunciations must be linked to specific deterring actions taken 
under the aegis of the United Nations and international law. 
  Comrades, we notice that the more the Israeli repression in 
the occupied territories intensifies, the more the heroic 
intifadah escalates, the more brave the heroic intifadah 
becomes, the more the Palestinian struggle in the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip intensifies, and the more the steadfastness of 
the kinsfolk in the Golan and the resistance of our people in 
southern Lebanon increases. 
  Israel's odious crimes confirm that the settlement issue, 
which represents the direct and specific features of Israel's 
expansionism and aggression, stands as a basic and important 
obstacle in the face of the peace process. It also violates 
international laws and norms because it entails geographic and 
demographic changes in the occupied territories. Thus, it is 
imperative to tackle the issue of settlements and view it as a 
focal point of the peace process. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by David Makovsky] </F>
  [Excerpts] Public opinion must be prepared for the possible 
dismantling of some settlements, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
told reporters yesterday. But he insisted that the fate of the 
settlements is an internal Israeli affair, completely divorced 
from the current negotiations with the PLO. 
  Peres also told foreign correspondents Israel does not have 
the money to meet settler demands for compensation in return for 
evacuation. [passage omitted] 
  Peres told reporters that the government does not have the 
political power to evacuate Jews from settlements. 
  He insisted that the government would seek to convince the 
public that this needs to be done, but it cannot come as result 
of PLO demands. 
  When asked about the wisdom of having settlements remain, 
Peres said removing them would cause a deep schism in the 
country. "We wanted to push through an agreement with minimum 
opposition. That is one of the reasons why we insisted the 
settlements remain where they are. We thought that any 
different approach would split the nation beyond recognition," 
he said. 
  When pressed by reporters on the idea of compensating 
settlers who wish to leave, Peres scoffed at the notion. 
  "They are talking about very large amounts of money," he 
said. We aren't forcing them to leave, so why should we pay 
compensation? In Sinai, since the government forced them to 
leave, there was reason to compensate them. If we start with 
compensation, it will be an endless story. I don't think we 
have to do it."

<F P=106> [Report by Sulayman Nimr: "King Husayn Performs Minor </F>
Pilgrimage, Holds Talks With King Fahd"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- King Husayn yesterday evening performed 
minor pilgrimage rituals in holy Mecca. He had arrived in 
Jeddah at midday in his first visit to the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia since the Gulf crisis erupted in the summer of 1990. 
King Husayn used to visit holy Mecca to perform minor 
pilgrimage on al-Qadr night, 27 Ramadan, every year, and to 
visit the tomb of the great prophet. But he could not do that 
for over three and a half years because of the Gulf crisis. 
  King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz received the Jordanian monarch 
late last night in holy Mecca, where the custodian of the two 
holy mosques is spending the last 10 days of Ramadan close to 
the Kaaba. 
  The meeting between the Saudi and Jordanian monarchs is the 
first between the two leaders, who were separated by their 
positions during the crisis of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
Riyadh considered Jordan's position substantially supportive of 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. What further aggravated the 
crisis in relations between the countries -- which is happening 
for the first time -- was the position of the Jordanian media 
and press toward Saudi Arabia during and after the crisis. 
  Arab diplomatic circles hope that the expected meeting 
[al-liqa' al-mutawaqqa'] between the custodian of the two holy 
mosques and the Jordanian monarch will lead to opening a new 
page in inter-Arab relations based on sound and clear 
foundations. The circles said that there is a positive 
atmosphere with the king vis-a-vis the gradual restoration to 
health [of relations] with the Arab states which adopted 
positions that disappointed the Saudis during the Gulf crisis. 
In this connection the circles cited the custodian of the two 
holy mosques' meeting over a month ago with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat, who visited Saudi Arabia to perform 
minor pilgrimage. He was received by King Fahd in Riyadh. The 
sources also cited the continued normalization of Saudi-Yemeni 
relations, which culminated last month in the Saudi monarch's 
reception of 'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Yemeni 
Presidential Council. 
  It was noted that King Husayn and the delegation 
accompanying 
him -- which included al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, head of the 
Royal Court, and some members of the ruling Jordanian family -- 
were accorded a reception usually accorded to Arab and Islamic 
leaders who arrive in the Kingdom to perform minor pilgrimage. 
The king and the delegation were received at King 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Airport in Jeddah by Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the amir of 
the holy Mecca region. And King Husayn stayed at al-Hamra' 
Palace.

  [Text] The capital city of Afghanistan, Kabul, was today 
the arena of heavy fire exchange among the warring factions. 
The fire exchange killed or wounded dozens of people. Several 
rockets landed near a mosque in a north-western district of 
Kabul, where the food consignment dispatched by the UN was being 
distributed, killing at least six people and wounding 30 others. 
  At dawn this morning, the exchange of fire between the 
supporters of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, in the eastern and southern suburbs of 
Kabul, left several casualties.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F>
Tunis by Mehmet Ali Birand-- live; from the 32d program, in 
English with simultaneous translation into Turkish] 
  [Text] [Birand] Mr. Chairman, thank you for sparing your 
time tonight for us. We have seen very horrible pictures from 
the occupied territories. Now, does that mean that this is the 
end of the negotiations with Israel, the end of the peace 
process? 
  ['Arafat] Firstly, with all efforts with the Arabs, with the 
Muslims, with the nonaligned movement, with the Europeans, we 
want to have a strong resolution in the Security Council. 
Eleven days have passed without being able to achieve this 
result. I ask: Why? Because there is U.S. opposition, and U.S. 
support now of the Israeli point of view, especially concerning 
Jerusalem and concerning the international protection, the 
mechanism of this international protection. 
  [Birand] Mr. Chairman, will you be going back to the 
negotiating table after this resolution? 
  ['Arafat] I was informed by Mr. Christopher about the 
invitation which was offered to us by President Clinton. We are 
not against it, but first of all we have to protect our people. 
We have to give them tranquillity and security. 
  [Birand] Yes, so if I understand correctly, you need from 
the Israeli side protection. 
  ['Arafat] From the international, not only from the Israeli 
side. 
  [Birand] And then you will start again negotiations, after 
you achieve this protection and after the UN Security Council 
passes a resolution? Is that correct? 
  ['Arafat] Not only that. Are we going only to take pictures 
like the last time, or will we implement what has been agreed 
upon? Everyone is informed about the maneuvering of the 
Israelis. Till now they did not.... [pauses] They are trying 
to make time and not to implement what has been agreed upon and 
what has been signed in the White House. 
  [Birand] Palestinians are accusing you of naively believing 
the Zionists. 
  ['Arafat] This is not a personal matter. Of course, we all 
have opposition, and we are proud of our democracy, and 
everybody has the right to express openly his point of view 
against our will. As [name indistinct] has mentioned, God bless 
he who criticizes me. 
  [Birand] Do you think that the peace process might again be 
revived, or do you think that it is over now? 
  ['Arafat] You see, what is important now is that we are in 
need of international involvement, especially from the [word 
indistinct] Russia and the United States; from the European 
Union; and from our brothers, the Muslims; from our brothers, 
the Arabs; from our brothers, the Nonaligned Movement; from all 
our friends all over the world. We need their support, their 
strong and complete support so that our people can feel safe, 
secure, and the tranquillity of the peace process will be [word 
indistinct]. 
  [Birand] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Cairo, 8 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo 
Sa'id Kamal has stressed that the PLO insists that Israel submit 
a written document in which it commits itself to withdrawing 
from Gaza and Jericho no later than 12 April in accordance with 
the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, otherwise 
there will be no guarantee for the success of the peace process. 
In a statement to MENA today, Kamal said that he and Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa yesterday evening discussed the Egyptian and 
Palestinian efforts with the United States and the European 
Union intended to have the UN Security Council pass a resolution 
condemning the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and protecting 
the Palestinian people. 
  Kamal said that the Palestinian leadership insists on a 
Security Council resolution even if the United States were to 
veto it. He pointed out that the Palestinian leadership 
conveyed its demands to Israel and that Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's envoy, perhaps Jacques Neriya or an Israeli 
minister, will convey the Israeli response to these demands to 
the Palestinian leadership in Tunis in the next 24 hours after 
the mini-meeting of the Israeli cabinet. 
  MENA has learned that the Palestinian leadership notified 
Israel through Israeli envoy Neriya of a number of conditions 
and principles with which Israel must comply for resumption of 
the peace talks. Foremost among these conditions are: 
  1. Providing international protection throughout the 
occupied territories and not only in the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area, where the temporary Palestinian self-rule will 
begin, as well as Hebron, as Israel has offered. 
  2. Ensuring that this protection will be real and applied 
not only by UN observers as Israel wants. 
  Kamal said that France, Russia, Norway, and Spain have 
offered to participate in international protection, either 
something belonging to the United Nations or through special 
multi-nationality agreements with the guarantee of the two 
cosponsors of the peace process -- the United States and Russia. 
He noted that Britain expressed readiness to participate in a 
UN observers force. 
  MENA has learned that the PLO does not ask that these forces 
be heavily armed, but only lightly armed to defend themselves. 
He noted that the third Palestinian demand is the dismantling 
of four Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, 
including the Bet Hadasa settlement in the center of Hebron and 
the departure of 400 extremist Israeli settlers who live inside 
the Arab city of Hebron. 
  Ambassador Sa'id Kamal said that the Palestinian leadership 
demands that the issue of settlements be discussed at the 
negotiating table directly after Israeli withdrawal in 
accordance with the text of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, and not 
within the two years as the Israeli side is demanding. 
  It is worth noting that the Declaration of Principles 
stipulated discussing the issue of the settlements as soon as 
possible. 
  The Palestinian ambassador in Cairo clarified that the 
fourth 
Palestinian demand is to disarm all Israeli settlers and prevent 
them from carrying weapons outside their settlements. Their 
protection should be taken on by the Israeli forces in 
accordance with the security arrangements that were agreed upon 
during the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
  It is noteworthy that Israel declared its approval for 
disarming some extremists from the Kakh and Gush Emunim groups, 
who are considered the radical extremists. This will not 
include the rest of the settlers, though. 
  The fifth Palestinian demand is to form a neutral 
investigative committee to establish responsibility for the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and punish those responsible or 
compensate the victims of that massacre in moral and material 
ways. 
  The Palestinian side maintains that the massacre was 
committed not by just one Israeli extremist from the Kakh 
movement; many individuals from the Israeli forces took part in 
it also. 
  MENA has learned that the Palestinian leadership is not 
expected to accept holding a meeting between Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
without meeting the Palestinian demands and without 
international guarantees, especially as regards protecting the 
Palestinian people. 
  Palestinian sources affirmed that the negotiations cannot be 
resumed without setting the appropriate atmosphere for them -- 
something that will not be realized except through international 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories, especially since the situation has now become very 
volatile as a result of the frustration the Palestinian people 
are feeling and the emergence of trends and conflicts demanding 
reaction and revenge for the death of the Palestinian martyrs.

  [Text] Juniyah, Lebanon, March 9 (AFP)--The Lebanese Army 
defused a gift-wrapped bomb outside the French cultural center 
in the heart of Lebanon's Christian community on Wednesday, 
fuelling fears of further attacks ahead of the pope's visit. 
  The incident in the coastal town of Juniyah came 10 days 
after a bomb attack on Our Lady of Deliverance Church in 
northern Beirut killed nine people and wounded 55 in the nearby 
Christian community of Zuk Mikha'il. 
  Pope John Paul II pays his first visit to Lebanon in May and 
some political leaders have already voiced concern over his 
safety. 
  The six-kilogram (13-pound) bomb was concealed in a 
gift-wrapped package placed outside the French cultural center 
in the Ghadir area of Juniyah, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of 
Beirut. 
  It was found by Chantal Mansur, a teacher at the center, who 
alerted the army, the French embassy charge d'affaires Bernard 
Letourneau told AFP. 
  The army said an unidentified group had recently protested 
over a decision to move the French cultural center to another 
location. It did not elaborate. 
  But Letourneau denied any plans to close down the center, 
which served as a consulate during the early days of Lebanon's 
15-year civil war. 
  He said the building was owned by the Maronite Catholic 
Sisters of the Holy Family, and they were renegotiating the 
lease which expires in 1995. 
  "I don't know who the target was, the sisters or us. But it 
seems that this is the latest in a series of unfortunate 
attacks," he said referring to the February 27 church bombing. 
  Letourneau added he had instructed the directors of all 
French cultural centers and schools in Lebanon "to be vigilant." 
  An AFP photographer said army troops were stationed outside 
the center after the incident. 
  Secretary General of the right-wing Phalange Party Karim 
Paqraduni -- which was devastated by a car-bomb in December 
which killed three and wounded 100 -- said he expected more 
attacks. 
  "Thanks to God today's attack was aborted. But I expect more 
bombings. They are part of a cycle which is aimed at the 
destabilisation of peace in Lebanon," Paqraduni told AFP. 
  "Christians feel they are the victims of such terrorist acts 
and these attacks will continue as long as the assailants go 
unpunished," he added. 
  The investigations into the church bombing and into the 
attack at the Phalange headquarters have made no headway. 
  Paqraduni said a series of steps by the government to 
strengthen the country's security apparatus, including plans to 
bring back capital punishment, "are all good things as long as 
they don't remain ink on paper." 
  Security measures have been stepped up in churches, mosques 
and schools in Lebanon.

  [Text] Warrant Officer Muhammad al-Dada, a military expert

  According to available information, the device was placed by 
two unidentified persons in their twenties who were driving a 
black BMW around the center. The central security forces 
arrested the two persons for interrogation. It turned out that 
they had maps of Juniyah and neighboring areas. A third person 
was taken in for interrogation by the security agencies. 
  The gift-wrapped device was six kg of a highly-explosive 
material, equal to 25 kg of TNT, and was placed at the main 
entrance to the center. It was discovered by the center 
manager, Mrs. Chantal Mansur, who was suspicious and contacted 
the security agencies. 
  A security meeting was immediately held in the office of 
Juniyah Company Commander Colonel Ziyad 'Urabi in the presence 
of the chiefs of security in the region. 
  The French Foreign Ministry announced a short while ago that 
Paris is considering with the Lebanese authorities the 
possibility of adopting security measures to protect French 
interests in Lebanon. The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed 
out that the targeted cultural center will resume its activity 
as usual. He condemned the sabotage attempt, noting that the 
French Government is in contact with the Lebanese authorities to 
shed light on the incident and uncover the circumstances 
surrounding it. 
  Sources at the French Embassy have said that there are no 
plans to close the center as rumored. 
  Upon receiving the news, the French charge d'affairs headed 
to the cultural center to find out what happened. 
  Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan telephoned 
the French charge this afternoon to convey the Lebanese 
Government's denunciation of the incident.

  [Text] Cairo, 9 Mar (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have expressed 
their hope that an early solution will be found for the current 
problems in Yemen. The two leaders held a joint news conference 
tonight following four hours of talks. 
  President Mubarak said that we are about to find a solution 
to these problems. He added that the talks covered a number of 
topics, including the situation in Yemen, bilateral relations, 
and several Arab issues. 
  The Yemeni president voiced appreciation for Mubarak's 
efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said that he and 
President Mubarak reviewed longstanding bilateral ties, 
inter-Arab relations, and the current crisis in Yemen. 
  President Salih said that he briefed President Mubarak on 
the 
Yemeni crisis and the Pledge and Accord Document signed recently 
in Amman. The troubles should have ended with the signing of 
the Amman document, but regrettably the crisis has dragged on 
and has resulted in military clashes, which we do not want, the 
Yemeni president stated. 
  President Mubarak opened the news conference by welcoming 
the 
Yemeni president. Mubarak said: We discussed a number of 
topics during our meeting, including the problems in Yemen, 
bilateral relations, and other Arab issues. I believe we are 
about to resolve many problems. 
  The Yemeni president replied by thanking President Mubarak. 
President Salih said: I am happy to be here in Egypt and to 
hold talks with my brother President Mubarak. The Yemeni 
president added that he and President Mubarak reviewed 
longstanding Yemeni-Egyptian relations, inter-Arab relations, 
and international issues. 
  President Salih pointed out that the Yemeni crisis began on 
19 August when differences surfaced among the three coalition 
parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, and the Yemeni Reform Group. 
  I briefed my brother President Mubarak on the details and 
causes of this crisis. I also briefed him on the Pledge and 
Accord Document that was concluded in Amman. The document was 
supposed to bring the crisis to an immediate end so that the 
leadership could resume its constitutional and executive tasks, 
but unfortunately the crisis continued and had military 
consequences, a development which we did not wish to see, 
President Salih remarked. 
  The Yemeni president said: Inspired with a sense of national 
responsibility, the three parties of the coalition agreed to 
withdraw the units from their positions on the pre-May-1990 
partition lines. Most were withdrawn, with the exception of a 
few thousand troops in certain governorates, which will be 
pulled out as well. But some provocations and media posturing 
continues, President Salih added. 
  I have discussed this matter with my brother, President 
Mubarak. The Egyptian president is holding consultations to 
reconcile the two sides and to find a peaceful solution to the 
current problem. I should recall here that Yemeni unity was 
achieved through peaceful and democratic means, President Salih 
stated. 
  The Yemeni President said: This problem should be resolved. 
We are eager to settle all problems through peaceful and 
fraternal means and find an understanding. We do not want the 
troubles in Yemen to fester. 
  We highly appreciate the part played by the Egyptian 
leadership, government, and people and the great concern your 
country displays toward Yemeni unity. This is hardly 
surprising. Egypt played a major role in inspiring the 
revolutions of 26 September and 14 October and has sent us the 
best of its sons to assist us, President Salih noted. 
  The two presidents then answered questions from reporters. 
  The Yemeni President was asked if the withdrawal of military 
units is linked to bringing to trial those involved in recent 
terrorist operations. He responded: The Pledge and Accord 
Document calls for the withdrawal of all military units from 
major towns. Other units will remain in their positions whenever 
this is in the national interest of unified Yemen. 
  The document also calls for measures to achieve security and 
stability. According to that document, those involved in acts 
of sabotage and violence should be arrested in accordance with a 
plan to be presented by the interior minister to the coalition 
government led by Haydar al-'Attas. The government is 
responsible for the implementation of the document, President 
Salih stated. 
  The Yemeni president added: The leadership was supposed to 
close its ranks so that the Presidential Council and the 
coalition government could draw up plans or a detailed program 
for the implementation of the Amman document. Unfortunately, 
following the Amman meeting the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party returned to the commercial and economic capital of Aden 
and nothing was done. 
  President Salih said: We are ready to cooperate with other 
Yemeni leaders in ensuring the arrest of all terrorist elements. 
However, we have to point out that no party is in the employment 
of another party. We cannot perform our tasks unless there is 
harmony among the leaders. This is the responsibility of the 
government, not the president. 
  The Yemeni president added: The Presidential Council and the 
government were supposed to meet immediately to implement the 
Amman agreement. Unfortunately, Socialist Party leaders 
returned to Aden. 
  Concerning the call issued by President Mubarak for the 
restoration of Arab solidarity, President Salih said: We fully 
support this pan-Arab stance. There is a need to restore Arab 
solidarity and clear the atmosphere following the rupture caused 
by the Gulf war. We appreciate the call made by the Egyptian 
president and people. Even without President Mubarak making 
this call, we are aware of and appreciate the efforts he is 
exerting with all brothers to restore Arab cooperation. 
  Asked about the task of achieving Arab solidarity and 
unity, President Mubarak said: Egypt is, above all, an Arab and 
Islamic country. We are advocates of Arab solidarity. We have 
been long before I took office. The Gulf war left a trail of 
scars and divisions in its wake. It took a long time for the 
dust to settle and the healing process to begin. We have not 
spared any effort in restoring Arab solidarity and cooperation 
in various fields. I believe that today the situation is better 
than at any time before. We are still making an effort. 
  We hope, God willing, that we may all come to believe in 
Arab 
solidarity and see the need to close Arab ranks. This, of 
course, requires effort but we are working on it because we see 
this as a primary commitment of the Arab Republic of Egypt, 
Mubarak said. 
  President Salih was asked about his country's position on 
terrorism and about a recent statement made by a Yemeni official 
that some terrorist elements returning from Afghanistan are 
living in Yemen. He responded: The Yemeni leadership, 
government, and people are against terrorist elements, wherever 
they may be. Egypt's security is a part of the security of the 
Arab people. Yemen's security is a part of Egypt's security. No 
Arab country should think that it is safe from terrorist 
operations conducted under the slogans of Islamic or leftist 
extremism. We are against terror in all its forms because it 
yields nothing but havoc and destruction. 
  The Yemeni president added: It is true that there are 
elements who came back to Yemen from Afghanistan. But most of 
them are Yemenis who went to Afghanistan to engage in jihad and 
were sponsored at the time by Western and some Arab countries. 
These countries sponsored them in the effort to wage jihad 
against the Russians in Afghanistan, and even against some Arab 
regimes in the Arab world. Now we are reaping the harvest of 
this intellectual and political terrorism. 
  President Salih said that Yemen is opposed to terror in all 
its forms. He said: The elements that are in Yemen are 
Yemenis. Some people claim that there are Egyptian terrorists 
and some from other nationalities in Yemen. If these people 
provide us with a list of names, we will be ready, in the 
context of coordination and in accordance with agreements, to 
take all necessary legal action against anyone engaged in acts 
of terror in any Arab country.

  [Text] Yesterday evening President Yasir 'Arafat received 
an urgent message from the Russian administration conveyed to 
him by an envoy of Russian President Yeltsin. 
  The Russian leadership's message to 'Arafat came a few hours 
after the issuing of the Russian proposal in Moscow calling for 
the convening of a second international conference, similar to 
the Madrid conference, to activate the peace process after the 
Hebron massacre. But Israel was swift to express its opposition 
to this proposal and its preference for continuing the bilateral 
talks. The United States affirmed the same stance.

<F P=106> [Report from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] The PLO leadership in Tunis has taken very seriously 
a number of statements issued following the Hebron massacre, 
copies of which were dispatched to Yasir 'Arafat. The PLO 
leader immediately informed the members of the intifadah higher 
central committee, the West Bank committee, and three of his 
aides for occupied territory affairs of these statements. These 
aides are Ziyad Abu-Ziyad, Mahmud al-'Alul, and Jibril al-Rujub. 
The statements were extensively distributed during the three 
days that followed the massacre. The issuing side described 
itself as the Fatah committee inside the occupied territory. 
  One of these statements, which carried the heading: "Appeal 
to the Fatah Leaders," was addressed to Faruq Qaddumi, 'Abbas 
Zaki, Sakhr Habash, Muhammad Jihad, Muhammad Ghunaym, and Khalid 
al-Hasan, which the statement described as the Fatah leaders in 
the absence of a collective leadership. A copy of the statement 
was sent to 'Arafat by one of his aides who said that it was 
distributed on a large scale in the al-Baq'ah refugee camp [in 
Jordan]. The statement demanded that an emergency leadership be 
formed to put reform programs in effect and asked that Fatah 
return to the field to carry out all kinds of struggle, 
especially the armed struggle. 
  In conclusion, the statement addressed the abovementioned 
Fatah leaders by saying: Your response or lack of response to 
this appeal will gauge the extent of our dealing with you. 
  Another statement addressed to the Fatah leaders described 
the negotiations and the peace process as a tool for 
circumventing the Palestinian people's struggle and sacrifices. 
The statement leveled sharp criticism at the Palestinian 
leadership, describing its members as leaders who can only 
commit themselves to implementing instructions from the White 
House, which did not allow them to react to the Hebron massacre 
except with condemnations and denunciations. 
  In another statement attributed to the Unified National 
Leadership of the Intifadah--Qawim [resist], an appeal was made 
to reconstitute the intifadah's strike forces in all parts of 
the state of Palestine, restore the state of popular Palestinian 
unrest and direct it toward the occupation and settlers, and 
begin a comprehensive and responsible national dialogue to unify 
efforts and confront the current phase. 
  Other statements of similar import studied by 'Arafat and 
his 
aides are attributed to the western sector in the Fatah 
Movement. One of these statements carried a warning to the 
settlers that the time for retribution has come. 
  Similar statements were also issued attributed to the Fatah 
cadres in Jordan and Tunisia, rejecting the negotiations and 
calling for a change in the Fatah and PLO readerships, which 
'Arafat took very seriously. He demanded information on who 
stands behind these statements and the weight they could carry 
on the way to creating an organizational coup on the highest 
level within the Fatah Movement.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] Two Palestinian commissions of inquiry into the 
Hebron massacre are currently operating in Hebron: one set up on 
5 March by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and the other appointed 
by the Islamic administration in Jerusalem. 
  The investigation of the Islamic commission focuses on three 
aspects. The first regards the guard procedures at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs by the Islamic Waqf and the Israel Defense Forces 
[IDF] prior to and on the day of the massacre. The commission 
found that the four IDF soldiers who were present at the site 
during the massacre fled from the cave as soon as the shooting 
was heard. The other issue this committee is investigating is 
the events during the massacre, mainly those pertaining to the 
evacuation and treatment of the wounded. The committee found 
that IDF soldiers fired at the Palestinians who wanted to 
evacuate the wounded and at ambulances. This caused a delay of 
more than one hour in the evacuation, which caused the death of 
some of the casualties. The third issue under the commission's 
investigation deals with events during the two days following 
the massacre, the manner in which hospitals treated the wounded 
from the cave, and casualties from IDF soldiers' fire during 
clashes in the city. 
  Palestinian sources from Hebron associated with the Islamic 
commission have said that the commission obtained a document 
which contains a plan by the Jewish settlers to push the Muslims 
out of the Cave of the Patriarchs. According to the sources, 
Supreme Court President Me'ir Shamgar, head of the Israeli 
commission of inquiry, has, through intermediaries, requested a 
copy of the document. The members of the Islamic committee have 
not yet decided whether to accept the request, the sources said. 
  The committee appointed by the PLO is about to present an 
official request to Israel's top echelons -- including Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin; Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of 
the IDF units in the West Bank; and Brigadier General Gadi 
Zohar, head of the Civil Administration -- asking for permission 
to collect testimonies from IDF soldiers who were at the Cave of 
the Patriarchs and its vicinity. 
  The PLO committee, the headquarters of which are located at 
the Hebron Academics Association building, has so far collected 
40 testimonies of Palestinians who were present during the 
massacre, 12 testimonies of people who were wounded during the 
massacre, and the testimonies of four Islamic Waqf guards who 
were at the site during the massacre. The committee has also 
drafted charts of the site and the circumstances of the 
massacre. The committee's findings will be handed over to the 
PLO Executive Committee in Tunis. 
  The PLO committee is made up of 11 Hebron residents: five 
lawyers (including two former judges), three physicians, an 
engineer, a surveyor, and Shaykh Muhammad Nazim Tahbub, the 
Hebron area mufti, who is also a member of the Islamic 
commission board. The committee is headed by Attorney Hashim 
al-Qawasmi, a former district court judge and West Bank district 
attorney. It also includes engineer Mustafa al-Natshah, former 
Hebron mayor and a leading Fatah public figure in the region. 
  The PLO committee is divided into four subcommittees, each 
having a separate area of investigation. A subcommittee 
investigating the legal aspects, assigned with conducting a 
debriefing of the chain of events during the massacre and after 
it, has so far collected 40 testimonies of Palestinians who were 
at the Cave of the Patriarchs during the massacre. A medical 
subcommittee is examining the issue of the massacre fatalities 
and is questioning the wounded. A technical subcommittee is 
examining the site layout, and preparing drafts and diagrams. A 
shari'a (Muslim-religious) subcommittee is dealing with the Cave 
of the Patriarchs status as a holy site and the ritual 
procedures in it. Attorney Hashim al-Qawasmi, committee head, 
said yesterday he believes the committee will end its work in 
two weeks. 
  The Islamic committee is made up of four members, all 
residents of Hebron: an attorney, a university professor, and 
two clergymen. Two members of the committee, including Dr. 'Aziz 
Duwayk, who was deported to south Lebanon, are supporters of 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The head of the committee 
is Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Muhtasib, the Hebron shari'a qadi 
(ruling on Islamic laws). The committee was set up the day 
after the massacre by the Higher Islamic Council and the Muslim 
Waqf Council in Jerusalem. 
  The members of the committee collected 30 testimonies of 
eyewitnesses and Cave of the Patriarchs Waqf officials. It 
intends to question Palestinian casualties who are hospitalized 
in al-Muqasid in Jerusalem and government hospitals in Bayt Jala 
and Ramallah. The committee has asked the Civil Administration 
for permits to leave the Hebron area, which is under curfew, and 
travel to the government hospitals to collect testimonies there. 
This committee has stated, giving a preliminary figure, that 36 
Palestinians were killed on the day of the massacre by Barukh 
Goldstein and IDF soldiers' fire throughout Hebron. The 
committee will soon publish its findings.

  [Text] Bonn, March 10, IRNA -- A Palestinian doctor who is 
now living in Germany has disclosed more details on the massacre 
of Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on February 25. 
  Maysam Abu-'Ali, a former resident of Hebron, said that he 
had been in the shrine at the time of the massacre and at the 
hebron Islamic hospital after the incident. He noted that at 
05:15 am Friday Barukh Goldstein together with at least six 
other Zionists who were all in army uniforms attacked the mosque 
with tens of hand grenades and then sprayed the worshipers with 
bullets. About 53 worshipers were immediately martyred and 250 
others severely wounded while seven others, trying to flee the 
mosque, were killed and 40 others injured by heavy fire of the 
Zionist soldiers outside the mosque, he added. 
  He dismissed the Zionist regime's claims that Israeli forces 
had not cooperated with the attackers and said that the soldiers 
opened heavy fire in front of the Hebron Islamic hospital on 
Muslims who had rushed to the scene to donate blood to the 
wounded, killing three and wounded 30 others. 
  On Palestinians reaction to the massacre, Abu-'Ali remarked 
that despite extenive presence of the heavily armed Zionist 
forces around al-Aqsa mosque, over 90,000 Palestiians turned out 
to hold the Friday prayers in the mosque. In a demonstration 
which followed the prayers, 17 Palestinian worshipers were 
martyred and tens of others were wounded, the doctor said. 
  He continued that the Arabic translation of the message of 
the leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, 
on the Hebron catastrophe, which was soon distributed in all 
parts of the occupied territories, raised hope in the hearts of 
the oppressed Palestinians.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Hamas leader Mahmud al-Zahhar by </F>
Henrique Cymerman in Gaza city; date not given] 
  [Text] Jerusalem -- "This massacre was to be expected from 
the outset. The Israeli people and government do not believe in 
peace. Israel speaks of peace negotiations but thinks only of 
its security and trade agreements with the Arab countries. 
Fatah's stance is shameful, because they use guns only at 
festivities and weddings; it would be illogical for 'Arafat to 
agree to go to Washington for the negotiations. 'Arafat is a 
strange and crazy individual," Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, the 
current leader of Hamas -- the most feared Palestinian 
fundamentalist group -- told LA VANGUARDIA in an exclusive 
interview in Gaza city. 
  "Hamas has a right to defend itself from Israel's existence. 
Thus it says frankly in its pamphlets, slogans, and graffiti, 
and on the streets, that it will seek out the Israelis and 
attack them," al-Zahhar asserted. Almost at the same time, the 
Israeli official radio station -- Kol Israel -- was announcing a 
lethal attack in Hebron by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' 
military wing. 
  [Cymerman] Is it true that the prophet Muhammad chose the 
fasting month of Ramadan for his holy wars -- more than any 
other month in the year? 
  [Al-Zahhar] The most outstanding battles of the Islamic 
world took place during Ramadan. Following these battles, the 
spread of Islam was very rapid. It can be seen that most of 
Islam's victorious battles against the infidel were in the month 
of Ramadan. 
  [Cymerman] A few days ago the PLO leader and the Israeli 
foreign minister signed an agreement in Cairo. How do you view 
this, in your capacity as leader of an Islamic movement? 
  [Al-Zahhar] We said from the start that we would gain 
nothing from this peace process, which is just the achievement 
of security for the Israeli side and of the Palestinian side's 
capitulation. Now it means the presence of Israeli troops in 40 
percent of the area of Gaza. According to the agreement, they 
are fully entitled to pursue those whom they call "wanted 
persons." They can come at any time to our homes and seek their 
"wanted persons." The Israelis will also be the only force on 
the approaches to Gaza and Jericho. Thus there is no difference 
between the current occupation and the implementation of the 
latest agreement. The Israelis will never carry out a 
withdrawal, since this interferes with anybody's daily life 
under the heading "security requirements." It can be seen that 
there is simply a justification of the occupation. That means 
settling the Israelis in the most comfortable areas of Gaza, 
while the occupation still exists in reality. 
  [Cymerman] One of the results of the agreements will be the 
coming of Yasir 'Arafat and the establishment of a strong 
Palestinian police force.... 
  [Al-Zahhar] If this police force is here to serve the 
community, we will receive it willingly, but if it becomes the 
hands of Israel to establish a tyrannical regime in this area, I 
believe that they will do what Israel wishes. The people will 
endure no more tyrannies. They have resisted the occupation 
since 1967 and paid a high price -- thousands of years of 
imprisonment, thousands of martyrs. We seek the elimination of 
any kind of occupation. 
  [Cymerman] Do you believe that 'Arafat is a traitor? Do you 
believe that he has sold out Palestine? 
  [Al-Zahhar] In the first place, I would like to remind you 
of 'Atnan Yasin, the traitor responsible for the events of June 
and July 1992 -- the conflict between Hamas and Fatah. He was 
the person most responsible for those clashes. We fear such 
people. Palestine does not belong to one man's organization or 
even to a state. Palestine does not belong to a generation. 
Palestine was and will be part of the Islamic world. 
  [Cymerman] Will Hamas take part in the general elections for 
the autonomous entity? 
  [Al-Zahhar] Hamas believes that the new situation will be 
more dangerous for the Palestinians than the occupation. The 
international attitude is opposed to the occupation, but through 
justification of the occupation through these agreements this 
will create many problems for the Palestinians. What will 
become of the millions of Palestinians abroad and of the 
hundreds of thousands of deportees? What will become of 
Jerusalem, with the rest of the West Bank? What will become of 
our rights over Palestine? 'Arafat and his colleagues must 
answer all these questions. Hamas will not take part in the 
elections and will not assume the role of opposition in the 
Palestinian autonomous entity. Hamas will continue to resist 
the Israelis' presence by all means. 
  [Cymerman] That is, you see no future for the peace process 
between Israel and the Palestinians.... 
  [Al-Zahhar] This is no peace process. It is an agreement 
between the PLO and Israel. The occupation will be more legal 
from the international viewpoint. Israel will be the dominant 
force and the center of authority in Tel Aviv, and will give us 
Palestinians the right to self-control. That is what autonomy 
means; the same as the Kurds in Iraq. The central government -- 
the master of the land -- will give self-determination to a 
minority national group. With the signing of this agreement 
'Arafat is saying that Israel is the master of all Palestine and 
that it is giving us the opportunity to set up an autonomous 
entity. This is the most dangerous point in the the agreement 
signed in the so-called peace talks.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman 
for the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has urged the other 
Palestinian forces and factions to develop a jihad and militant 
program to deal with settlers and Zionist occupation. 
  He said: The Zionist challenge forces all to confront this 
challenge. The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions [Hamas military 
wing] have worked out a plan to deal with the phenomenon of 
settlement, the most dangerous phenomenon of occupation, which 
stands as the beginning of extending the Zionist entity to any 
land on which settlements are built. 
  In an interview with AL-DUSTUR, he said the jihad and 
struggle operations are not coordinated for pure security 
reasons. Each mujahid and struggling group plans and carries 
out its independent operations, but these operations should have 
specific objective and timing. 
  He added: We believe that Palestinian forces, whether they 
are 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions, Fatah Hawks, the Red 
Eagle, or any another mujahid faction are asked to meet the 
demands of the Palestinian people and the Arab and Islamic 
nations by taking revenge on criminal Zionists and give a clear 
signal to the world that the Jewish blood is not dearer than the 
Arab or Muslim blood. 
  Ghawshah was answering a question on coordination between 
the 
members of Alliance of the Palestinian Forces [APF], or between 
Fatah and Hamas, to retaliate against the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. He said: There are some technical obstacles such as 
curfew, siege, and restrictions imposed by occupation. These 
measures may delay the retaliation, but certainly a good chance 
will come and should be used with full force, sacrifice, and 
determination. [passage omitted] 
  He concluded his interview by saying the APF will hold a 
meeting in Damascus on 20 March to discuss organizational and 
political issues. He said an APF delegation will be formed to 
visit the Libyan Jamahiriyah this month. The visit will be the 
beginning of other visits that will include a large number of 
Arab and Islamic countries, including Iran.

  [Text] Amman--A group of Palestinians, believed to be 
mainly returnees from Kuwait who have set up a self-styled 
"Palestinian government -- provisional leadership council," has 
sent a message to U.S. President Bill Clinton disowning the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and calling on 
Washington to shift its stand away from the PLO in the quest for 
a Middle East peace settlement. 
  Palestinian observers and diplomats dismissed the group as 
insignificant. Some said they never heard of such a group and 
others said it did not represent any large number of 
Palestinians and did not enjoy grass-roots support. 
  The group, if indeed it has any membership that warrants 
such 
a description, appears to be one that first surfaced in Jordan 
in late 1990, mainly represented by one man who used to describe 
himself as a Palestinian journalist who was forced out of Kuwait 
following the Iraqi invasion of the emirate. 
  The man, who gave varying names to different people, claimed 
that he represented "the sons of Palestine who enjoy grass-roots 
support in the occupied territories, particularly the West Bank." 
  "We will show our real strength when the time is right, and 
we will take over the leadership of the Palestinian people 
everywhere," the man has reportedly told news organisations 
before disappearing from view for some time. 
  According to some Palestinian sources, the man has 
supporters 
among a few of the Palestinian returnees from Kuwait who 
resented the PLO's sympathy for Iraq during the Gulf crisis. 
The PLO stand, they argued, had led to their ouster from the 
emirate. 
  A copy of a letter from the group, addressed to "United 
States of America, Washington, White House, his kind attention 
his excellency the president of the United States Mr. Bill 
Clinton" (sic), was made available to the JORDAN TIMES Tuesday 
[8 March]. 
  The typed message was on a letterhead bearing the name 
"Palestinian government -- provisional leadership council," and 
had an official-looking rubber stamp. 
  A recorded voice answered calls to a telephone number given 
in the letterhead. 
  No comment was immediately available from the U.S. Embassy 
here, whether it had received a copy of the letter or how it was 
treating the purported group. 
  The undated letter said the PLO "doesn't represent the 
Palestinians under the occupation and immigrants all over the 
world," and that the Tunis-based organisation "represets only 
those who are employees and having orders and salaries from 
(Chairman Yasir) 'Arafat." 
  "We as Palestinians are very grateful to your adminstration, 
which collected financial aid to the occupied territories," said 
the letter, written in poor English, in an apparent reference to 
Washington's role in securing international pledges worth more 
than $2.2 billion to support the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord. 
  The rambling letter, parts of which did not make much sense, 
said economic development of the occupied territories was not 
possible if it was "run by military mentality people," and 
suggested that an international conference be held in Jordan to 
elect "a temporary Palestinian administration to run the 
occupied territories" with help from Jordan. The proposed 
administration should tackle the various aspects of the 
situation of the occupied territories, including economics, 
health, agriculture, education, public relations, industry and 
investment, it said. 
  According to the group, participants in the proposed 
administration should include Palestine, Jordan and unspecified 
"other areas" and "some persons" from the PLO in their capacity 
as independents. 
  A pre-qualification set by the group for anyone to take part 
in the proposed administration is "good behaviour" and a 
"behaviour certificate" from the country of residence. 
  It called for the establishment of a "Jordanian-Palestinian 
national bank for development" with 50 percent of the equity for 
Jordan and Palestine and the rest for countries which have 
pledged aid. 
  The capital for the bank could come from the pledged funds 
and the institution will be run by a committee under the 
"supervision of your administration," the letter told President 
Clinton. 
  It also called for the establishment of a society "for old 
fighters" to be trained in civil administration and development 
and to "let them (old fighters) live a pure life by cleaning the 
military mentality that they (have) lived..." 
  It argued that "any Palestinian state couldn't act without a 
link with Jordan" and expressed "hope that matters (will) turn 
back to (pre)-1967 June (as) a result of a survey (presumably a 
referendum)." 
  "Let the Jordanians and Palestinians give any name to the 
new 
unity," it said. "This unity will (preempt) establishing 
different administrations... the nature of partnership between 
(the) West and East Bank(s) of (the) Jordan River could be not 
separated... 
  "Jordan has given opportunities for immigrants to take their 
chances to grow up educationally and financially," said the four 
page letter. "People are fair will consider how much Jordan 
(spent) on such... matters..." [sentence as published] 
  "If such a link takes place," said the letter, "the 
replacement of Jordan (as) Palestine will be completely" 
preempted.

  [Excerpt] Bethlehem -- An economic expert has estimated the 
losses to the Palestinian economy from the ongoing military 
closure and curfew imposed on the occupied territories 12 days 
ago at $50 million. 
  Dr. Nabil Kawkali, a Hebron University researcher, said that 
the economic losses cover all productive, consumer, social, 
cultural, and tourist sectors. If the military closure 
continues for a longer period, the losses will increase. He 
added that the labor and commercial sectors have suffered the 
most, because transfers of goods between the Palestinian 
occupied territories or with Israel have stopped. The 
agricultural sector comes next, as the military closure has 
compounded the losses of farmers, who have been suffering from 
consecutive losses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Without a doubt, the political reverberations of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre are, as yet, not clear enough for us to 
assess their ultimate impact on the negotiating process. For 
one thing, worldwide condemnation of the massacre has not been 
such as to lead one to conclude that the Middle East peace 
process will go forward or that the Palestinian side has 
improved its bargaining position at the negotiating table. For 
another, the enormity and monstrosity of the massacre can only 
reinforce the image the world has of the odious nature of 
occupation. Which means that true salvation for the Palestinian 
people and the path to true peace in the region lie in a total 
Israeli evacuation of the Palestinian territory. We need to 
come up with the proper response to the massacre, and, since its 
political reverberations are still developing, their nature and 
scale will be determined by the mechanisms employed by both 
sides of the conflict and the skill with which they are used. 
  If the enemy government seeks to assuage resentment and 
return things to where they were before the massacre, in order 
to escape the concessions expected of it as a price for this 
abominable crime, then the PLO must embark upon a vigorous drive 
to restate the truths the odious occupation has brought into 
sharp focus; namely that true peace in the region is an 
impossibility without a complete Israeli withdrawal and 
guarantees for the freedom and independence of the Palestinian 
people. While this is not the first massacre committed against 
the Palestinian people during their conflict with Israel, it 
marks a first in terms of scale and ugliness. It was committed 
against the background of a negotiating process that pushed the 
ugly face of occupation into the background and presented 
decisionmakers and public opinion around the world with the 
appearance of a thriving future peace. In other words, the 
negotiating process supplanted the true picture of occupation 
with good wishes and grand dreams that could not realistically 
come true without potent pressure being brought to bear on the 
occupying power. If that pressure has not been forthcoming it 
is because the Israeli occupation has not been perceived to be 
that much of a threat to the lives, security, and future of the 
Palestinian people. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque atrocity has debunked these illusions 
and 
sent the message that peace and occupation do not mix. We must 
think of a response to the massacre less in the manner of an act 
of retribution and more in line with a comprehensive policy. 
This is because any purely retaliatory act will hardly strike 
at the heart of occupation. Nor should our retaliation be 
restricted to one domain. We must invest the political 
dividends of the massacre at the negotiating table while 
providing a direct answer by spilling Israeli blood through a 
systematic intensification of the armed struggle against those 
who bear direct responsibility for the massacre -- the Kach 
movement's gangsters and occupation troops. This is to 
underscore resistance and the ongoing intifadah as legitimate 
rights as our people strive to wrest their freedom and 
independence. In other words, we must engage the enemy in a 
multifaceted battle until it is defeated and all forms of its 
presence on our land and the dark era of occupation are 
eliminated once and for all. These are inexorable 
eventualities. Revolution until victory.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Blood, Massacre, and Settlements"] </F>
  [Text] A very long time will pass before the Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre fades from our memory, a massacre the Zionist 
army and settlers committed against worshipers, with advanced 
planning, monstrous precision, and a diabolical terrorist 
spirit. The perpetrators of this horrible massacre intended it 
to violate our people's sacred three: The sacred Friday, the 
month of Ramadan, and the Ibrahimi Mosque, so the wound would be 
deeper, the pain doubled, and the outrage profound. 
  The Zionist movement and its successive generations have 
adopted this kind of massacre as an article of faith and a modus 
operandi against our Palestinian people. Such massacres have 
always been a precursor of prominent phases in this long and 
sanguinary struggle, beginning with the Dayr Yasin and Qafr 
Qasim massacres, continuing with the Gaza, al-Sammu', Khan 
Yunis, the al-Aqsa mosque [words indistinct] 'Uyun Qarah [Rishon 
Letziyyon], and ending with the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  We know that in these massacres, Zionists sought to wipe out 
the other side and liquidate it so the reality could be the same 
as the myth. The Jewish myth, characterized by racism and 
hatred, describes Palestine as a land a without a people. The 
massacre was designed to wipe out the people and uproot their 
civilized existence and pave the way for the triumph of the myth. 
  In implementation of the policy of massacres, we find that 
the leaders of the Zionist movement, who have been and continue 
to be leaders of the State of Israel, made massacres the main 
component of their personal history, from which they derive the 
feeling of supremacy. They participated in the series of 
massacres, beginning with Menahem Begin and Yitzhaq Shamir and 
ending with Yitzhaq Rabin, Israel's incumbent prime minister 
himself. This means that none of the Israeli rulers, past or 
present, stand against this kind of black, bloody terrorism 
because none will stand against his own nature and his very 
being. 
  In this latest massacre and in line with our argument, Rabin 
cannot be the adversary and judge at the same time, the killer 
who is asked to protect the Palestinian people. [Words 
indistinct] clear to the international community which says it 
wants peace, that it does not approve of these massacres. 
  The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre reveals to us that the Zionist 
settlement in the Palestinian territory cannot be [words 
indistinct] in blood. The leaders of the Israeli Government 
have several times tried to improve the image ofthe settlements 
and belittle their danger. The successive U.S. administrations 
also tried to belittle the importance of the settlements in 
order to justify to the (?taxpayer) their costs in tens of 
billions of dollars. However, the Zionist settlements have 
always exposed themselves by themselves, affirming that they 
[words indistinct] and the shedding of Palestinian blood during 
their prayers. 
  Those in the Israeli governments who created the settlements 
are aware of this. It is natural that when we plant thorns we 
should not expect grapes, when we plant bitter plants we do not 
expect honey, and when we plant settlements we cannot expect 
peace. In short, settlement building is against peace. The 
advocates of settlements are against peace. The Israeli 
Government that wants the settlements to remain, wants the peace 
to disappear simultaneously. This is the aim of the massacre. 
This is the motive behind its perpetration at this manner and 
at this time so it may madly violate the three sanctities at the 
same time. 
  It is well-known that the peace tool is negotiations and the 
perpetrators of the murders aim to stop these negotiations. We 
should not fall in the trap set for us. We should not slip into 
the abyss prepared for us by the criminals. At the same time, 
there can be no negotiations for the sake of negotiations. 
Negotiations must have codes. [Words indistinct] The blood 
shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque is more important than letting the 
course of the negotiations proceed as it is. It is more 
important than adhering to the same items and [word indistinct] 
of the agenda. Why should it be discussed after two years? Why 
not now? Why should the first point in the agenda not be the 
settlers and the settlements, because this point is either the 
key to peace or the key to the return of bloody clashes. Let 
everybody take the responsibility.

  [Text] At the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, 
Pakistan has deferred voting on its resolution condemning human 
rights violations in occupied Kashmir for one year, while India 
has expressed willingness to allow a fact-finding team of Muslim 
ambassadors to visit occupied Kashmir. A three-point package 
has been worked out after high-level contacts among Pakistan, 
Iran, and China. Sixteen countries supported the formula. 
  Iranian former envoy in Geneva, Naseri, pledged to continue 
to pressure India to alleviate the hardships of Kashmiris and 
improve the human rights situation. Other countries supporting 
the package are Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tunis, Australia, 
Guinea Bissau, Libya, Colombia, Malawi, Mexico, Brazil, Costa 
Rica, Nigeria and Mauritania. 
  The foreign minister told newsmen in Islamabad that Pakistan 
has achieved its objective to awaken world opinion about the 
plight of the Kashmiri people. He said despite the deferment of 
the resolution, the Kashmir issue will be raised at other world 
forums. Sardar Asif Ali described the package as a success of 
Pakistan's diplomacy. He said we have not agreed to an offer by 
some countries to delete a paragraph in the resolution about 
sending a fact-finding mission to occupied Kashmir. He said 
almost all member countries at the commission expressed concern 
on the grave human rights violations by Indian troops in 
occupied Kashmir. 
  Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal, federal minister for information 
and broadcasting, who was present on the occasion, recalled U.S. 
President Clinton's statement deploring human rights abuses in 
Kashmir. He said the European countries have also deplored the 
worsening situation in occupied Kashmir. This reflects an 
achievement of our foreign policy, the minister added. The 
information minister said no government in the past moved such a 
resolution. 
  Iqbal Akhund, Pakistan's ambassador to the United Nations, 
told a news conference that Pakistan has succeeded in pressuring 
India to an extent that it has gone on the defensive on the 
Kashmir issue. He hoped that India will respond positively to 
demands made by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in her address to 
the UN Human Rights Commission last month. The demands include 
the freedom of human rights agencies and international media 
representatives to visit occupied Kashmir without any 
hindrances, freeing of the jailed Kashmiris, revocation of 
inhumane rights given to Indian security forces, and the 
reduction of troops in the held-valley.

  [Text] Islamabad, March 8: Pakistan has been the target of 
Indian intelligence agency, RAW, in collusion with the Afghan 
intelligence agency, Khad. 
  This was stated by the Federal Minister for Interior, Lt Gen 
(Retd) Naseerllah Babar. He said there was a link between the 
RAW and Khad which seem to jointly undertake terrorist 
operations against Pakistan. 
  He was responding to a question from this correspondent on 
the possibilities of the involvement of the Israeli agency 
Mossad operating in Afghanistan. 
  The Minister said since most of the former communists 
trained 
by KGB, the Russian intelligence agency, had now shifted to 
India, there was a strong possibility that the Indian and Afghan 
Intelligence agencies were cooperating. 
  The Minister said Mossad operating in Afghanistan was a bit 
too far-fetched an idea." To another question the Minister said 
the government has put the suspected Afghans living in Peshawar 
under surveillance. He agreed that most of the former 
communists who have acquired residence in Peshawar were trained 
by the KGB. 
  The government, he said, had so far not received reports on 
the hijacking of the school bus from the intelligence agencies. 
However, he said that during his recent visit to Peshawar he was 
told about the antecedents of one of the hijackers who he said 
belonged to Khad. He said his photo was shown to him with other 
Khad agents. This hijacker he said belonged to Parwan province 
in Afghanistan. 
  The government the Minister said was not trying to jump to 
any conclusion on the hijacking incidence and wanted to give 
full time to the agencies to investigate.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Iranian Proposal of a New Regional Alliance </F>
and What Realism Demands"] 
  [Text] Iran has proposed to the visiting Indian and Chinese 
foreign ministers that a bloc be formed consisting of PRC, 
India, Iran, and Pakistan to eradicate the external influence 
from the region. These countries have resources which, if they 
were pooled, would enable them to check the interference of the 
great powers. For the moment, the Iranian proposal can be 
considered merely a desire which is formally expressed on such 
occasions, because Iran is well aware that the components of 
such an alliance are antagonistic and hostile to each other. 
China and India had a military confrontation during the 1960's, 
and subsequently their relations remained strained for a long 
time. It was rather like a cold war between them. Of course, 
they now have concluded an agreement to promote friendship. The 
problems that were once created by Tibet's Dalai Lama have also 
subsided and the border dispute has been resolved to a certain 
extent. As a result, India has decided to withdraw two 
divisions of troops from along the frontiers with China and to 
deploy them in Punjab and Kashmir. At the international level, 
however, the two countries are still contending with each other 
to establish regional influence and superiority. India, in 
particular, is badly gripped by this fever. 
  Similarly, Pakistan and India have a long history of 
disputes, spanning about 1,200 years. India has repeatedly 
targeted Pakistan for its military aggression to avenge the 
1,000-year Muslim rule over India. In 1971, the Indian military 
intervention in East Pakistan resulted in Pakistan's 
dismemberment. Now, the Indian troops are engaged in the 
massacre of Muslims in occupied Kashmir. Moreover, India is also 
threatening Pakistan with a limited war. For obvious reasons, 
how can the two hostile countries join hands on some regional 
interests? The Government of Iran is fully aware of these stark 
realities, and that is why Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
has urged India to strive to resolve the Kashmir issue 
peacefully. Iran is fully conversant with the gravity of the 
Kashmir problem. It is said that Ayatollah Khomeyni, the 
founder and leader of the modern Islamic revolution, was of 
Kashmiri origin. 
  It has been Iran's official stand that extending support to 
the independence struggle of subjugated nations is not an 
abetment of terrorism; it is like extending a helping hand to 
realize the right to self-determination. Iran has always 
rejected the U.S. and Western objections in this regard, and 
never accepted the U.S. and European interpretations of the 
human rights. In the words of the TEHRAN TIMES editor, the 
United States has used the human rights issue as a political 
weapon against the entire world including China, Pakistan and 
Iran. 
  In view of these facts, the Iranian proposal to form a 
regional bloc cannot be termed concrete or serious, nor should 
Pakistan be concerned about it. In fact, if there can be a new 
alliance or bloc, then it should include Pakistan, Iran, 
Afghanistan, the Islamic countries of Central Asia, and Turkey. 
That will be a natural alliance. These countries not only have 
the commonality of religion among them, they have ancient 
historical and cultural ties as well. An alliance comprising 
Iran, India and China would be lacking natural ingredients. 
Rather, they lack anything in common. The Muslim countries, 
having common religious, historical, cultural and economic 
values and interests, should join in a single platform and form 
a regional bloc. If China can be included in the present 
(?alliance), then there is no reason why U.S. hegemony in the 
world could not be resisted. 
  The history of cooperation and friendship between Pakistan 
and China is enviable. The PRC has now offered to cooperate 
liberally with Pakistan to meet its weaponry needs. Pakistani 
tanks and missiles are also being manufactured in China. China 
did not even care for the U.S. pressure in this regard. No one 
will object to China's inclusion in the alliance of Muslim 
countries as China has not been seen to carry out aggression 
against any neighboring country, nor has it claimed the 
territory of any of its neighbors. It is hoped that the Iranian 
Government will adopt a realistic approach regarding the 
formation of a regional bloc.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Taking Sides?"] </F>
  [Text] According to a press report there is a general 
belief both in the government as well as the non-governmental 
circles in Kabul that Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence 
(ISI) is taking Golboddin Hekmatyar's side and helping him out 
with fuel, food, and ammunition supplies. The allegation that 
Hekmatyar is favoured by the government here is not really new. 
It goes way back to the Zia years and the successive 
governments that followed him when the concerned agencies 
supposedly showed a preference for Hekmatyar, leading to the 
conclusion of their partisanship. But that was in the past. 
The present government's policy, as recently articulated by the 
Prime Minister herself, is not to interfere in any way in 
Afghanistan's infighting. But it seems the government here 
needs to do more than making a simple statement of good intent 
to ensure that the perception about Pakistan's alleged 
interference or a partisan policy does not persist. Pakistan 
has to outgrow that perception if it has to play the role of an 
honest broker of peace in Afghanistan. 
  As things are, Hekmatyar does have an advantage over his 
rival groups in that he is in control of territory that is 
contiguous to Pakistan and thus aid supplies from this country 
cannot reach Kabul without his consent. What it also means is 
that, even if the Pakistani Government did not approve of it, he 
could get the needed food and fuel from the illegal channels 
that have traditionally been operational in the area. But for 
that he would still need the money. Hence the question raised 
by a Kabul government official, "If he is buying it, how is he 
paying for it", needs a convincing answer. One seemingly simple 
choice before the government of Pakistan is to wash its hands 
completely of Afghanistan, which of course it cannot possibly 
do, given the level of its own interests there. The other more 
productive course for it would be to find ways and means of 
having direct communication with the rival groups while 
remaining strictly neutral. The recent efforts in that 
direction made by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali though 
commendable, are not enough. What is even more important, the 
ISI and the Foreign Office should not be working at cross 
purposes and if the ISI is not helping the cause of 
reconciliation between rival groups and is actually, as alleged, 
aggravating it, it must be reeducated as to the grave political 
consequences such a role could lead to. The situation calls for 
a detailed review of the country's Afghan policy at the highest 
government level.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Moving Towards a New Regional Order"] </F>
  [Text] On the occasion of the visit of the Chinese and 
Indian foreign ministers to Teheran, Iran has made it clear that 
it would like to see greater cooperation between the three 
countries. Pakistan has also been included in the framework of 
regional cooperation and to that extent it appears that closer 
ties with India are not being sought at the expense of its close 
ties with this country. However, there are clear indications 
that the regional scenario is changing, Iran, for instance, has 
signed a number of agreements of considerable economic 
significance with India. Given the primacy of economic interest 
and Iran's relative isolation in the international community, 
such ties are likely to supersede most other considerations. It 
is significant also that on the eve of the vote in the Human 
Rights Commission on the issue of human rights violations in 
Kashmir the Iranian foreign minister seems to have endorsed the 
Indian position favoring a resolution through bilateral 
negotiations between India and Pakistan. The new alignments 
taking shape in the region would suggest that the potential of 
Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), now emerging as a major 
regional economic arrangement, has been reduced. As for our 
close ties with China, again it would be useful to keep in mind 
the recent thaw in Sino-Indian relations whereby the two 
countries have agreed to reduce tensions with regard to their 
border dispute. In the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet 
Union, India's ally and China's adversary, India and China 
clearly appear to be moving towards a relationship very 
different from the one they have had for approximately three 
decades. Apart from the economic ties that are developing 
between the three states, a common concern is that of resisting 
pressure from the United States which Iran, China and India, 
have felt in unsettling, albeit different, ways. This has been 
translated into a call for minimising external interference in 
the region and the internal affairs of states. Pakistan itself 
subject to a US aid cut-off as a result of differences on the 
nuclear issue may well appreciate the sentiment but will have to 
be guided also by the prevailing situation on the ground 
especially vis-a-vis India. 
  In any case Pakistan should be realistic and take due 
cognizance of changes taking place in the region. It has to 
accept that sovereign states are free to choose their allies or 
friends in accordance with their perceived and changing 
interests. Undue sentimentality in this context has caught us 
unawares in the past and adversely affected our ability to 
adjust in time to changed circumstances. If the new regional 
order entails closer ties between China and Iran on the one hand 
and our major adversary India on the other, then so be it. We 
may still be in a position to use our relationship with the 
former to influence the latter in some ways with regard to 
working towards an acceptable resolution of key outstanding 
issues such as Kashmir and nuclear non-proliferation in the 
region. In any case, while not compromising on our basic 
national interests and keeping these in view maintaining 
friendly relations with different countries, it is important to 
ensure that the on-going developments do not eventually lead to 
a distancing from longstanding friends in the region.

  [Excerpt] In his upcoming visit to Washington, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will try to persuade U.S. Administration 
leaders to put off the enforcement of the new regulations on the 
use of military aid and also, in the future, allow Israel to 
purchase military equipment directly from U.S. firms. 
  Last year the Pentagon decided to ban direct military 
procurement through commercial channels and compel all countries 
receiving military aid to place their orders through U.S. Army 
components. The decision was made in the wake of the Rami Dotan 
affair in a bid to improve U.S. control over the use of aid 
funds. 
  Israel objected to the amendment of the regulations, 
claiming 
it will increase costs and complicate military procurement. 
Israel's supporters in Congress exerted heavy pressure and 
managed to put off the enforcement of the new regulations until 
June 1994. Rabin will now try to get another reprieve, and will 
ask the administration to take Israel's unique needs into 
consideration. 
  The prime minister will say Israel is prepared to make its 
purchases through military channels, if in special cases it is 
allowed to buy military equipment directly from the 
manufacturers. 
  Rabin's visit in the United States will mainly be devoted to 
the peace process, and security issues will not feature 
prominently in his meeting with President Bill Clinton.

to renew the process. 
  Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that 
Jerusalem rejects the idea and stresses that only the format

for negotiations. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 2000 GMT on 9 March in

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Da'ud Kuttab in Jerusalem on 8 March] 
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres acknowledged that the Palestinian people's daily reality 
has not changed since the signing of the Declaration of 
Principles, but he believes that the agreement's implementation 
will lead to a basic change that will be felt by the ordinary 
citizen. 
  In an exclusive interview with Palestinian reporters at the 
Israeli Foreign Ministry, Peres said that if talks are held on 
the final stage, the two sides will reach more documents and 
papers but the situation on the ground will not change. 
Instead, he called for concluding the negotiations within 
several days and implementing the transfer of power, including 
the arrival of the Palestinian leadership and police force, so 
that they would take charge of the situation in Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip. 
  Peres said that subsequently it will be possible to 
negotiate 
over expanding the area of Palestinian control, whereby it will 
include all the occupied territories. Afterward, talks will 
begin on the final status. 
  In response to the journalists' questions about disarming 
the 
settlers and negotiating on settlement activity and 
international protection, Peres said that those steps pose 
complications because Rabin's government relies on a one-vote 
majority in the Knesset. Despite this, Peres believes that 
acceptance of the Gaza-Jericho plan, which he described as a 
first step, will lead to a tangible change among the Palestinian 
people. 
  Regarding the continuation of settlement activity and the 
confiscation of land, Peres vehemently denied that land 
confiscation was continuing except for street expansion and 
nature protection. When one of the journalists presented him 
details of land confiscation, Peres said that he would study the 
issue. 
  With regard to evacuating the settlers from Hebron, Peres 
said that he would state his position on this issue in the 
cabinet meetings, but he added that there were legal problems in 
terms of evacuating the settlers en masse. 
  In answer to a question about whether it was possible to 
vacate the Hebron bus station, taken over by the Israeli Army 
since 1980, Peres said that he would study the matter. During 
the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, Peres tried to 
persuade the journalists to defend the peace process, saying 
that it was the best practical means for achieving Palestinian 
demands and aspirations. Peres expressed understanding of the 
Palestinian position's dilemma. He said that anyone who 
participates in a peace process will lose popularity because 
peace requires concessions from both parties. It is common 
knowledge that concessions do not increase the leadership's 
popularity. 
  Peres urged the Palestinian people to support 'Arafat 
despite 
all the difficulties. He said that the Palestinian people 
should be more supportive of 'Arafat, because he has given them 
something tangible by negotiating cleverly. Every Palestinian 
leader in the past failed to do this, and the Palestinian 
problem had remained in limbo. [passage omitted] 
  In answer to a question about the UN Security Council 
deliberations, Peres said that Israel's objection to applying 
the Geneva Conventions to the occupied territories stems from 
the fact that Jerusalem has been included in the resolution. 
This is opposed by Israel, because it considers Jerusalem to be 
part of Israel, not part of the occupied territories. 
  On whether a meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was possible, 
Peres said that they will meet to sign the agreement and not 
earlier, but contacts are under way on different levels and 
through different channels.

Chairman Moshe Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that 
Rabin's willingness to include Tzomet in his cabinet is 
tantamount to admitting the failure of his policy. According to 
Qatzav, he has learned that Rabin is using Tzomet to freeze the 
continuation of the implementation of the Oslo agreement after 
the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.

  [Text] The closure on the West Bank and Gaza is 
continuing, with Palestinians still banned from leaving for jobs 
inside Israel. Security sources told Qol Yisra'el it remains 
extremely difficult to protect the Jewish settlers living in 
Hebron. 
  Brigadier David Agmon, who investigated the Hebron massacre 
for the chief of staff, has confirmed that Barukh Goldstein was 
the only person to fire inside the Cave of the Patriarchs. His 
report, presented to the chief of staff at the weekend, also 
criticized security procedures at the site.

<F P=106> [Report by Hayim Shibi from Washington] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Clinton administration is close to deciding 
to place the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements on the list of terror 
organizations. [passage omitted] 
  If indeed the U.S. Justice Department decides to place Kakh 
and Kahana Hay on the list of terror organizations -- the very 
membership in which constitutes a criminal act -- this would be 
the first time in U.S. history that Jewish organizations will be 
on that list, along with Arab terror organizations. 
  This might create a situation in which Israel Defense Forces 
reserve officers who, according to Kahana Hay leaders, conduct 
training camps for the organization members in the United 
States, might be listed as members of a terror organization and 
become a target of a criminal investigation by the FBI. 
  Mike Gozovsky, the Kahana Hay Movement spokesman, told our 
correspondent that the organization includes 8,000 members who 
pay annual membership fees of $36 each. A fund-raising dinner 
the movement organized in New York recently, was attended by 
some 500 people who paid $125 each. 
  Another serious problem that might arise if the 
organizations 
are listed with other terror organizations, would be that 
raising funds for them would be banned. Israeli sources in 
Washington view with concern the administration acceptance of 
the Palestinian request to hold up "fund-raising campaigns for 
extremists" in Israel. It is feared that a broad legal 
definition would create a dangerous precedent which will create 
difficulties for a wide range of fund- raising campaigns in the 
future. 
  It should be noted that the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
Settlements Council, the City of Ari'el, and a series of Israeli 
public institutions have a regular fund-raising organ based in 
the United States. Americans also make donations to the belt 
neighborhoods around Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Avner Regev: "They Are Palestinians, Too"] </F>
  [Text] Reacting to last week's events in the Israeli 
Palestinian sector, Knesset Member Talib al-Sani' stated: A 
wide chasm has been created between the Israeli Arab population 
and the Jewish majority, and it is hard to see how it can be 
patched up anytime soon. Representing the Israeli Bedouin 
population, al-Sani' made it clear that the Hebron massacre was 
indeed a terrible thing; yet, it was the way the Israel Police 
and other security forces treated the Palestinian citizens of 
Israel, who expressed their reaction to the massacre, which made 
many of the Arab leaders think that they do not have equal 
rights as citizens. They will not accept the fact that there is 
different treatment of Jewish and Arab demonstrators. If the 
sights in the field express a reality, if indeed they expressed 
the way the Jewish majority really feels toward the Palestinian 
minority, then there seems to be no chance of holding a dialogue 
that would lead to coexistence in the foreseeable future. 
  The killing by police gunfire of a resident of the Bedouin 
village of Rahat during demonstration there last week started a 
fire that does not seem extinguishable in the near future. The 
reactions by the Palestinian citizens of Israel and the counter 
reactions by the security forces created a situation which casts 
doubt on the possibility of attaining an arrangement in the 
future that would satisfy the demands of one side. 
  Since the Hebron massacre, the leaders of the Arab public 
have been articulating the PLO negotiating demands, calling on 
Israel to accept them. For example, they call for dismantling 
settlements, disarming settlers, stating that the settlements 
and peace cannot coexist. The fact that the Negev Bedouin -- 
who until recently have not regarded themselves part of the 
Palestinian nation -- hoisted PLO flags, is an indication of a 
sweeping phenomena which points to a changing reality, currently 
forming before our eyes. 
  We have seen such flags hoisted in the Galilee and the 
Triangle, but the sights from the Negev, including the reports 
that stones were hurled at cars on the Beersheba-'Arad highway, 
make the Jewish population feel that the security situation has 
deteriorated -- and not only in the territories, but inside the 
Greed Line. 
  At a seminar of police commanders, convened last week to 
discuss aspects of the peace negotiations, the Hebron massacre 
was placed on the agenda. To the amazement of many of those 
present, some 25 percent of the officers expressed some degree 
of support for or understanding of the Hebron murder. 
Expressions that do not become police commanders were heard 
there, and the silent majority did not react with anger. 
  If the police commanders' anger in view of the situation in 
the territories is understandable at all, the way they reacted 
to the events in the Israeli Palestinian sector can probably 
explain their conduct as everyday law and order observers. 
Hence it is easy to sympathize with Knesset Member al-Sani's 
remarks regarding the double standard which prevails in Israel 
with regard to its Jewish and Arab citizens. 
  The continuation of the acts of protest by the Arab public 
here, in fact, reveals three levels of reaction: 
  One expresses pain over the Hebron massacre, in which 
worshipers were murdered during the fast of Ramadan while in a 
holy mosque, along with real sympathy for their brothers in the 
territories. 
  On a second level, Israeli Arabs express growing anxiety 
about acts carried out in the territories which, they believe, 
might be repeated against them, mentioning the events of Land 
Day and the Kafr Qasim massacre in the same context. They 
mainly fear that the Israeli reaction was not an isolated event, 
rather that it is the result of a policy which might make them 
change their place of residence. 
  Some Israeli Arab leaders believe that, in parallel with the 
transfer of settlers from the territories inside the Green Line, 
some of them might find themselves outside Israel's boundaries 
-- because of territorial changes or other reasons. 
  On a third level, the Israeli Arabs point at their distress 
over poverty and neglect in their sector, which causes 
frustration which, in turn, drags them to support a 
fundamentalist religious element which contains nationalistic 
elements in it. The combination of religion and nationalism 
breeds extremism, and not only in Islam. The Jewish group 
residing in Hebron is an example of this, even if this group 
does not suffer from poverty and neglect. 
  Israeli Palestinians and Jews now face a difficult dilemma. 
Having been repressed for years, the feelings of hostility and 
rage came bursting out, creating a new reality. The Oslo 
agreement, in which Israel recognized the PLO as the 
representative of the Palestinian people, does not stipulate 
whether or not the PLO also represents the Israeli and Jordanian 
Palestinians. 
  Israeli Arabs today regard themselves part of the 
Palestinian 
nation. Feeling rejected by the Jewish majority in Israel -- as 
was seen last week -- they might turn to the PLO for political 
asylum. For its part, the PLO will not hesitate to accept them. 
The leaders of Israel will then face a problem. It is possible 
that the Israeli Arabs will be party to comprehensive Middle 
East peace negotiations in which the Green Line will no longer 
be sacred. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is preoccupied with the 
political process, must take some time to formulate a 
comprehensive policy on the Israeli-Arab conflict. It could be 
assumed that it will be difficult to continue with the system of 
making interim arrangements to bring about short spells of 
quiet. Because the Israeli Arabs are on the political agenda 
today, he will have to listen to more voices than he has so far.

<F P=106> [Report by Sha'ul Rehavi] </F>
  [Text] A new report by the Betzelem Organization regarding 
law enforcement on settlers in the territories states, among 
other things, that the law enforcement authorities and the 
courts tend to be charitable when dealing with Jewish settlers 
who caused the death of Palestinians. The report, drafted by 
Eytan Palner, will be published next week. 
  According to Betzelem, from the beginning of the intifadah 
until the Hebron massacre, there were 62 incidents of 
Palestinian deaths caused by settlers in the territories. The 
report provides the following breakdown: 15 cases in 1988; 17 
in 1989; nine in 1990; six in 1991; 1 in 1992; and 14 in 1993. 
  During the same period, 13 settlers trials have been 
completed. Only one ended with the settler being convicted of 
murder, and this case is currently being appealed to the Supreme 
Court. In the other trials, the courts ruled causing death by 
negligence (6), manslaughter (1), or rioting (1), issued a 
sentence of admission to a psychiatric hospital (one person 
charged with two killings), and two settlers were acquitted. 
  It is worth noting that in his testimony before the 
commission of inquiry into the Hebron massacre yesterday, 
Central Command Commander Dani Yatom said that, as far as he can 
recall, there were one or two incidents in which settlers killed 
Palestinians over the past several years, and only one case was 
brought to trial.

stage a big terror attack in downtown Jerusalem. Our police 
affairs correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that the three 
admitted they had planned to stab a settler, a policeman, or a 
soldier and that they had thrown stones at policemen and 
worshipers at the Western Wall. The police investigation 
revealed that 24-year old Jamal Basti and his two cohorts, whose 
names were banned from publication, had planned to steal an 
Israeli car and use it to smuggle arms out of Tulkarm in order 
to stage a terror attack in Israel. The Jerusalem Magistrates 
Court remanded the three in custody until the end of legal 
proceedings.

  [Editorial Report] Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 9 March 
publishes a report on page A4 by Eytan Rabin which says: 
"Several incidents took place in the territories yesterday. 
Palestinian sources reported that seven Palestinians were 
injured in the Gaza Strip" while "the Palestinian sources also 
reported that one person was wounded during stone-throwing 
incidents in Ramallah." The report adds that a resident of the 
al-Burayj refugee camp "was injured yesterday by police gunfire 
when he tried to avoid a police roadblock" in the Gaza Strip. 
  Another report by Shlomo Dror and Gabi Zohar on page A5 of 
the same HA'ARETZ issue adds that "Palestinian sources reported 
that 20 people were injured" in riots in Jerusalem yesterday, 
"but East Jerusalem hospitals reported that only several people 
came in for treatment and were discharged later." According to 
the report, "police sources maintain that external elements have 
been causing agitation in Jerusalem. Last week, messages were 
sent to local leaders of Fatah, rejectionist front 
organizations, and religious organizations saying that 'the eyes 
of the world are currently on Jerusalem, which is why riots 
there are to be encouraged.'" 
  The report goes on to say that "several hundred Golan Druze 
yesterday staged demonstrations marking the Syrian revolution 
day and the Ba'th Party coming to power. The demonstrations 
ended quietly, and no arrests were made" as the police "avoided 
entering the villages and clashing with the demonstrators."

consultations. The postponement was sought by Pakistan. Reports 
say that Islamabad is under pressure from some Islamic 
Conference Organization -- ICO -- countries, notably Iran, to 
withdraw the resolution. As the commission took up voting on 
Pakistan's resolution early during the day, the chairman 
informed the house that Pakistani and Iranian delegations have 
sought postponement of the vote.

Ali, at Islamabad a short while ago. He told a press conference 
that consequently Pakistan has authorized China and Iran to 
decide the best course they feel is available for it. 
  Earlier, Beijing and Tehran approached Islamabad to postpone 
for three hours the voting on the resolution this evening so 
that further consultation could be held on certain proposals 
made by them. These options included either withdrawal of the 
resolution or its indefinite deferment. PTI, quoting observers 
in Islamabad, says Pakistan can agree to withdraw the resolution.

  [Text] India won a stunning diplomatic victory in Geneva 
last night when Pakistan was forced to withdraw unconditionally 
its resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. 
Reports say the Pakistani decision came after its delegation 
realized that there was no prospect of the resolution being 
carried. Leading the way, Iran appealed to Pakistan not to 
press for the resolution just before the voting was scheduled to 
begin. The Iranian move was supported by China. Immediately 
after, delegate after delegate of the developing countries, 
including Syria and Indonesia, appealed to Pakistan to withdraw 
the resolution. Majority of the countries indicated that they 
would abstain from voting. They said the issue should be 
resolved through bilateral talks between the two sides. 
  The leader of the Indian delegation, Mr. Atal Behari 
Vajpayee, and the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. 
Salman Khurshid, have expressed the satisfaction at the 
withdrawal of the resolution and called it a vindication of New 
Delhi's principled stand. 
  The leader of the Pakistani delegation said that Islamabad's 
move followed high-level consultations between Iran and Pakistan 
and the views of the majority of member countries. 
  The external affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, has thanked 
Iran and China for prevailing upon Pakistan to withdraw the 
resolution. In a statement in New Delhi, he expressed the hope 
that Pakistan will now be ready for bilateral talks under the 
Simla Agreement and desist from misleading the international 
community through false allegations of violations of human 
rights in India. 
  The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has complimented 
Mr. Vajpayee on phone for the excellent work done at the UN 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kanchan Gupta] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan has only itself to blame for the virtual 
defeat it has suffered at the UN Human Rights Commission [UNHRC] 
conference in Geneva, where it has to unconditionally withdraw 
its politically motivated resolution that was aimed at 
embarrassing New Delhi and subverting India's sovereignty over 
Jammu and Kashmir. Faced with a grim prospect of being found out 
for playing a game of lies and half-truth that would have led to 
a defeat of its motion had it been voted upon, Islamabad had 
dropped the paragraph calling for a UN factfinding mission to 
visit Kashmir from its resolution on Tuesday [8 March]. This 
paragraph was substituted with one that called upon India to 
ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Jammu and 
Kashmir. This was obviously done in the hope that there would 
be more takers for the resolution and it would be carried 
through. 
  India, of course, had repudiated this latest maneuver, and 
as 
much was evident when Dr. Farooq Abdullah, articulating New 
Delhi's response to the latest twist in Islamabad's devious 
gameplan, told the delegates that no resolution touching any 
aspect of Kashmir was acceptable to India. 
  Obviously, the Indian message had more takers than 
Pakistan's 
misadventurism, because by yesterday it was clear that 43 of the 
53 members of the UNHRC had decided not to have anything to do 
with the resolution. As for the remaining 10, obviously the 
majority were poised to vote against the motion. India owes its 
moral victory to various factors, including the excellent work 
done by its delegation in Geneva. The minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, who stationed himself in 
Geneva, valiantly fought against each and every charge that was 
leveled by Islamabad and its agencies masquerading as NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations]. Back at home, the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, made it clear that the Government 
of India is not lacking in resolve as far as protecting Kashmir 
from predators is concerned. The home minister, Mr. S.B. 
Chavan's spirited defense of India's case on Kashmir and its 
pledge to stake everything to defeat the Pakistani gameplan also 
contributed toward weakening Islamabad's resolve. Credit should 
also be given to China and Iran for finally convincing Pakistan 
about the folly of its action. 
  Will Pakistan learn a lesson from the humiliation it has 
suffered in Geneva? The outcome of the conference shows that 
while rhetoric as resorted to by the Pakistan prime minister, 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto, may sound fine, it does not yield results. 
India believes in peaceful coexistence with its neighbors and 
has consistently reiterated its commitment to bilateral 
dialogue. Hopefully, Pakistan -- having traversed the path of 
defeat -- will now realize that there is no substitute for 
peace, truth, and honesty. It is also hoped that Pakistan will 
stop stoking the fires that it has lit in Kashmir and honor 
India's territorial integrity. However, it remains to be seen 
if Ms. Bhutto's government has the political courage to accept 
defeat and mend its ways.

  [Text] Tripoli, 9 Mar -- The secretariat of the General 
People's Congress issued a statement today on the horrible crime 
committed by the Israeli occupation forces against Muslims in 
the holy Ibrahimi mosque. Here is the text of the statement: 
  The secretariat of the General People's Congress reiterates 
its anger at and condemnation of the horrible crime perpetrated 
in the Ibrahimi mosque and the repeated acts of aggression 
against the heroic Palestinian people which followed. 
  This horrible crime and other crimes perpetrated by the 
occupying Israeli invaders are considered the vilest acts of 
terrorism against innocent people performing the morning prayer 
in the middle of the blessed month of Ramadan. 
  The secretariat of the General People's Congress stresses 
that this crime and the others that have followed it are 
officially organized terrorism officially directed by the 
Israeli Government, which has based its existence on such a 
program since its establishment under the protection of the 
West, which has officially supported the policy of terrorism 
manifested in crimes, massacres, and the building of arsenals 
for weapons of mass destruction. 
  The secretariat of the General People's Congress, in 
addressing the conscience of humanity and all honorable people 
of the world headed by the sons of the Arab and Islamic nation, 
is insistent that that an end must be put to the tyranny, 
oppression, and repression exercised by the Israelis for racial 
motives and with the support of the West. The secretariat urges 
all of them, Arab and Islamic countries to exercise their rights 
in the UN Security Council, the United Nations, and the 
international forums to punish the tyrants who have been blinded 
by force and fanaticism, to put an end to their terrorist 
behavior and boycott them. 
  The secretariat of the General People's Congress asks that 
everyone should shoulder their responsibilities vis-a-vis these 
repeated horrible crimes which give warning of the results, 
which will have reprehensible consequences. 
  [Signed] The secretariat of the General People's Congress of 
the Great Jamahiriyah

  [Text] In Cairo, Libyan opposition figure Muhammad Fayiz 
Jibril said that next week the Libyan opposition will begin 
radio broadcasts from a Middle Eastern country, which he did not 
identify. Jibril said the radio will urge Libyans to escalate 
the struggle to topple al-Qadhdhafi and set up a democracy in 
Libya. He appealed to concerned international organizations to 
rescue the life of Colonel (Muftah Qurdum), a Libyan opposition 
figure whom the Libyan Television presented on Monday [7 March] 
as a spy working for the United States. 
  Qurdum introduced himself as a former Army colonel. He 
admitted that while residing in Switzerland he contacted Libyans 
living abroad, who supplied the Americans with information. He 
added that the Americans sought information on the Libyan Armed 
Forces and the Libyan missile program. They were planning to 
attack Libya with the help of their spies, who would then seize 
power. 
  Muhammad Fayiz Jibril said Qurdum made these false 
confessions under duress.

<F P=106> [By Taieb Mahjoub] </F>
  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, March 9 (AFP) -- 
Jordan's King Husayn was snubbed in Saudi Arabia and flew home 
Wednesday [9 March] after a Mecca pilgrimage which failed to 
clinch a reconciliation meeting with King Fahd, Arab diplomats 
said. 
  Saudi Arabia's cold reception for King Husayn on his first 
visit since July 1990 before the Gulf crisis was reflected in 
Saudi newspapers, which ignored the trip altogether. 
  The Jordanian monarch was taken aback and cut short his 
visit, during which he had also been expected to visit Moslem 
holy sites in nearby Medina, an Arab diplomat said, declining to 
be named. 
  Arab diplomats had said the two monarchs were to meet in 
Mecca, western Saudi Arabia, where King Fahd was also staying. 
But neither Saudi nor Jordanian officials confirmed that such 
an encounter was scheduled. 
  And yet the Saudi monarch late Tuesday received two 
governors 
from the Emirates, Shaykh Saqir Bin-Muhammad al-Qasimi and 
Shaykh Hamid al-Nu'aymi, who were also on pilgrimage to mark the 
final days of the fasting month of Ramadan. 
  On arrival in Jeddah earlier the same day, King Husayn was 
greeted at the airport by the deputy emir of Mecca, Prince Sa'ud 
Bin-'Abd-al-Muhsin. The same official saw him off. 
  In Amman, a senior official in Jordan's royal court played 
down the snub but Western diplomats criticized Riyadh's attitude. 
  "The aim of the king's visit to Mecca was purely religious" 
and no request was made for a meeting, the official said, 
declining to be named. However, "a gesture of courtesy (from 
King Fahd) would obviously have been welcome." 
  But a Western diplomat said the Saudi monarch's attitude was 
"an insult which shows the Saudis in an extremely bad light." 
  "By travelling to Saudi Arabia, King Husayn held out his 
hand 
to King Fahd who turned it down, contrary to the traditions laid 
down for a head of state and Arab customs," another diplomat 
said. 
  King Husayn's last visit came just two weeks before the 
Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990. 
  Amman-Riyadh ties soured amid Saudi charges that Jordan 
backed Iraqi President Saddam Husayn during the Gulf crisis. 
King Husayn also opposed the US-led military campaign which 
expelled Iraq from Kuwait in February 1991. 
  A Mecca encounter during Ramadan with King Fahd, the 
custodian of Islam's holiest sites in western Saudi Arabia, was 
expected to clear the way for a normalization, Arab diplomats 
said. 
  Since the Gulf war, Amman has sought to resume normal 
contacts with Riyadh, which had punished Jordan by halting its 
annual financial aid of 200 million dollars and oil shipments, 
and closing its markets to Jordanian goods. 
  After King Fahd sent his Washington ambassador to see King 
Husayn recovering from an operation in a US hospital in August 
1992, Jordan's monarch moved swiftly to announce that their 
misunderstanding was almost over. 
  But the Saudis -- whose Amman ambassador has yet to return 
to 
his post after having been recalled in October 199O -- insist on 
a public apology from Jordan for its stand on the Gulf crisis, a 
demand which King Husayn has criticized. 
  An Arab diplomat pointed out that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, 
who was also snubbed for three years because of his pro-Iraqi 
sympathies, managed to meet King Fahd during a similar 
pilgrimage to Mecca in January. 
  But the start of a Palestinian-Saudi normalization only came 
after PLO officials made their apologies to Riyadh, which before 
the Gulf crisis was a key financial backer with its oil wealth. 
  For Jordan, ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been 
complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling 
families. 
  While King Fahd is custodian of Mecca and Medina, King 
Husayn 
is a grandson of the Sharif of Mecca, Husayn, who was chased out 
of the Hejaz in the 1920s by the Sa'uds after his Hashemi family 
had ruled in Mecca since the 11th century. 
  Only last month, Amman brokered a peace deal to resolve the 
political crisis in Yemen, a country which Riyadh considers to 
be in its sphere of influence.

  [Text] The Higher Military Committee held a meeting in 
Sanaa today and discussed the results of the work of the 
military subcommittees, which are overseeing the return of the 
military units to their permanent camps before the recent 
crisis. The committee then issued the following statement: 
  The Higher Military Committee is pleased to announce to the 
brother citizens that the military commands' response to the 
committee's decision was very positive. The military units 
completed their withdrawal from the Ta'izz, Lahij, Ibb, Bab El 
Mandeb, Ma'rib, Shabwah, and Abyan Governorates. The withdrawal 
of units toward al-Bayda' and Mukayris also began last night. 
The return of the units to their previous positions is expected 
to be completed within the next 24 hours. 
  The Higher Military Committee, while stressing that the 
spirit of accord, the atmosphere of detente, and the eagerness 
to maintain the unity of the Armed Forces have prevailed in the 
circles of all the sons of the Armed Forces, appeals to the 
political leaders and the military commanders to preserve these 
achievements, which have satisfied the citizens, and to work to 
move to the second stage to apply the provisions of the accord 
document pertaining to the Armed Forces. 
  On this occasion, the Military Committee thanks the 
political 
leadership, the military commanders, and the sons of the Armed 
Forces for their cooperation and their response to the committee 
out of their national sense and their eagerness to maintain the 
safety and unity of the dear Yemeni soil. Blessed 'Id and many 
happy returns.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah: "Socialist Party Rejects </F>
Federation and Offers One of Two Options: Document or Partition"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Yemeni sources have emphasized that the 
current position of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] on ways of 
resolving the political crisis threatening the unity of the two 
parts of Yemen can be summed up in two options. The first is 
that the General People's Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG], the two northern partners in the ruling 
coalition, implement the Pledge and Accord Document in 
accordance with the interpretation and the measures agreed on by 
the YSP and the opposition, regarding which the GPC and the YRG 
still have some reservations or objections; or, that there be a 
return to the situation obtaining prior to 22 May 1990 and an 
announcement of the end of the unity experiment. 
  The sources said that Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib, 
deputy prime minister for internal affairs and member of the 
Political Forces' Dialogue Committee, which drafted the Pledge 
and Accord Document, late last month offered the YSP leadership 
the federation option as a way out of the crisis, along the same 
lines suggested last October by Salim Salih Muhammad, YSP 
assistant secretary general and Presidential Council member, but 
the party's Political Bureau rejected that option on the grounds 
that that suggestion had been overtaken by the recent military 
confrontations in Abyan and H rft Sufyan. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Faysal Makram and Iqbal 'Abdallah: "Sinan </F>
Abu-Lahhum Meets With 'Abd-al-Majid, Warns Of 'New Somalia;' 
Yemeni Socialist Party Proposes Confederation"] 
  [Excerpt] Sanaa, Aden, Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- Sources close to 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] yesterday changed tack, 
proposing a confederation formula to extricate the country from 
the political crisis it is experiencing and end the prevailing 
state of political and military tension. 
  The YSP circles' proposal, which reflects the depth of the 
crisis the united Yemeni state is experiencing, comes while 
circles close to the YSP have begun to believe that "the 
dialogue through the barrel of a gun" which began 21 February 
has made the federation proposal appear to have been overtaken 
by events. 
  In Cairo, Shaykh Sinan Abu-Lahhum, member of the Yemeni 
Consultative Council and member of the Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee -- who had issued a joint statement with Brigadier 
Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, deputy prime minister, warning of 
secession in Yemen -- urged Yemeni leaders to abandon their 
differences and achieve reconciliation. He warned of the 
possibility of Yemen turning into a new Somalia and the south 
separating from the north. He said: "That would not solve the 
problem, but, rather, would bring ruin to the country." 
  Abu-Lahhum attributed King Husayn's failure to achieve 
reconciliation to "Yemeni leaders' intransigence and failure to 
apply reason and reach an understanding." He described what is 
happening as "madness and a frightening nightmare." He 
expressed his fear that "the gap among Yemenis might widen and 
result in undermining national unity." 
  Following a meeting with Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary 
general of the Arab League, yesterday, he said: "The League is 
making extensive endeavors to secure a way out of the current 
crisis. This is in addition to numerous Arab mediations." He 
noted that he is going to meet with President Husni Mubarak "to 
ask him to intensify Egyptian efforts and reinforce Egypt's role 
in ending Yemeni disputes." 
  He denied that he had asked the secretary general to 
dispatch 
a Arab force to disengage northern and southern forces. He 
stressed that what Yemen needs is living consciences, not 
forces. "And mediations do not require military forces, but 
sincere intentions." He said that recent military clashes "have 
left a deep wound in Yemeni hearts." He pointed out that the 
"cause of the deterioration in conditions is officials' failure 
to implement the Pledge and Accord Document signed in the 
Jordanian capital recently." 
  In Sanaa, political and military sources spoke yesterday 
about the Yemeni-Jordanian-Omani committee's failure to complete 
the process of withdrawing military units from what used to be 
known as the "fringes" area before unity, and to return these 
units to their positions before the current crisis, which began 
on 19 August last year. [passage omitted]

  Bayraqdar stressed that the Arab League and his delegation

developments and repercussions resulting from the political 
crisis, and for their readiness to contribute to resolving this 
crisis. He thanked the delegation members for their sincere 
fraternal sentiments and their great pan-Arab care for 
safeguarding the Yemeni unity. 
  The brother Presidential Council member and the delegation 
reviewed aspects and factors of these developments and efforts 
that continue to be made in order to resolve the political 
crisis and end its repercussions in a way that guarantees the 
preservation of Yemeni unity and its gains, and tackles issues 
that led to these repercussions, in a spirit of collective 
responsibility by all national political forces and through 
complete care for the homeland's unity, by means of complete 
commitment to implementing all articles of the document of 
pledge and accord signed in Amman on 10 Ramadan [20 February]. 
  The brother Presidential Council member said: We are ready 
for full cooperation with the Arab League's efforts and other 
sincere fraternal efforts in order to resolve the political 
crisis and remove its repercussions in a way that will safeguard 
Yemen's unity and stability. 
  The meeting was attended by Staff Brigadier General

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alan George] </F>
  [Text] Iraqi leader Saddam Husayn is said to be planning a 
new military strike against Kurdish territories in the north of 
the country and to have deployed armored units at various points 
on the contact line with the Kurdish region in the past few 
days. This was reported by the Iraqi National Congress (INC), 
an umbrella organization of various opposition groups, in London 
on Friday [4 March]. 
  Such a military strike would be a direct challenge to the 
West, which has undertaken to protect the Kurdish region. The 
area is being monitored by U.S., British, and French aircraft. 
  According to INC's information, in talks with senior 
military 
officials in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on 23 February, 
Saddam announced the invasion of the Kurdish territory for early 
March. In a televised speech in January, the head of state said 
that he was intending to spend the Islamic (Id al-Fitr) feast in 
Kurdistan. The feast falls on 11 March. 
  The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed the 
troop movements in Iraq. A spokesman said in London: "It would 
be extremely unwise of Saddam to take such action."

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 1O (AFP)--Iraq is massing troops 
and militia allies along the frontlines with the Kurds who 
control the north of the country, a Kurdish defence official 
said Thursday [10 March]. 
  Jabbar Firman told AFP that the build-up of army troops and 
artillery began three days earlier south of the 36th parallel, 
above which the Gulf war allies enforce a "no-fly zone" to keep 
out Iraqi aircraft. 
  Further north, tribal militias are being deployed in 
strength 
near Irbil, which is home to 800,000 people and where the Iraqi 
Kurds have their capital, said Firman, who is in charge of 
Kurdish military affairs. 
  He gave no details on the build-up. 
  "In the no-fly zone, Iraq would not dare to attack the 
Kurdish-controlled region with its official army, therefore it 
is sending the militias," he said. 
  Firman charged that Iraq was planning an attack to distract 
public attention from the country's economic crisis, brought on 
by the UN embargo in place since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
  The Kurds have controlled a large chunk of northern Iraq, 
under the allied security umbrella, since an uprising following 
the 1991 Gulf war which evicted Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
  An Iraqi opposition group based in Tehran charged Wednesday 
that the army had launched a new offensive against Shiite Moslem 
villages in the marshlands of southern Iraq.

  [Text] Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, chairman 
of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq 
[SAIRI], today appealed to the United Nations to intervene 
immediately to stop the large-scale attack which massive forces 
belonging to the Iraqi regime have been launching on al-Ahwar 
marshes in southern Iraq since 3 March. 
  Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim said that the forces of that regime 
were using internationally banned napalm incendiary bombs in 
their attacks on the people of the marshes. 
  The Iraqi opposition leader pointed out that four armored 
and 
infantry divisions were taking part in this attack supported by 
forces from the Republican Guard for intervention whenever it 
was necessary. 
  Baqir al-Hakim called on the United Nations to put pressure 
on the Iraqi regime to implement the UN Security Council's 
resolution No. 688 which stipulates stopping the policy of 
repression against the civilian population in southern Iraq. 
  Reports coming from inside Iraq mentioned that tens of 
civilians were killed or wounded in these operations, while 
hundreds of others ran away into the marshes fleeing the 
bombardment of the Iraqi regime's forces.

  [Text] Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative 
Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, and Ja'far 
'Abd-al-Karim al-Barzanji, chairman of the Executive Council of 
the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, have commended the great and 
prominent role leader President Saddam Husayn, the architect of 
autonomy, has played in reaching a just and peaceful settlement 
of the Kurdish issue on democratic and fair terms on the basis 
of the doctrine, creed, and principles upheld by the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party. 
  In statements to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY on the 24th 
anniversary of the issuance of the historic 11 March statement, 
the two Kurdish officials added that settling the Kurdish issue 
and halting infighting in the Kurdistan region were only some of 
the significant accomplishments of the glorious 17-30 July 
revolution. They reiterated the Kurds' allegiance to the 
historic and unique leadership of leader President Saddam 
Husayn. They also reaffirmed their willingness to make 
sacrifices to safeguard Iraq's unity and thwart the enemies' 
schemes, which aim to undermine Iraq's sovereignty and national 
unity. 
  The two Kurdish officials noted that the lawlessness, 
instability, insecurity, anarchy, murders, and thefts currently 
prevailing in the Kurdistan region are cogent proof of the false 
claims made by archtraitors and archagents, who have accepted 
subservience to their foreign masters, the enemies of Iraq. 
  Concluding their statements, they asserted that agents and 
traitors will be defeated, with God's help and the determination 
of zealous Kurds, particularly since the zealous Kurds have 
always demonstrated their support for the courageous leadership 
of leader President Saddam Husayn.

Affecting Three of Talabani's Ministers"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that 
the "government of the region of Kurdistan" which runs the 
affairs of the Kurdish areas in northern Iraq has reshuffled its 
portfolios and that three ministries held by members of the 
leadership of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], led by 
Jalal Talabani, were affected. 
  Iraqi Kurdish sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that 
Sa'di Ahmad Birah, the agriculture minister in the Kurdish 
Government, replaced Humanitarian Affairs "Minister" Muhammad 
Tawfiq Rahim, who left the government; that the agriculture 
"ministry" portfolio was given to PUK Executive Committee Member 
Hazim Yusufi; and that Jamal 'Abdul, former governor of 
al-Sulaymaniyah, replaced Shirku Biks, the former "minister" and 
well-known poet who resigned in December last year, as culture 
"minister." [passage omitted] 
  PUK sources have confirmed the cabinet reshuffle but denied 
that it had any political significance. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, some Iraqi opposition figures and groups living 
in 
the British capital have completed preparations for a week of 
solidarity with the Iraqi people next week with the 
participation of influential figures in the fields of politics, 
culture, and art. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 2 March 
on page seven publishes a 1,500-word report by correspondent 
Khudayr 'Abbas Mahmud entitled "AL-THAWRAH Reveals a Secret 
About the Baby Milk Factory for the First Time." The report 
says the factory, which was the target of allied bombing on 21 
January 1991, has been reconstructed and is now operational, 
producing "milk that is 100 percent Iraqi" called "Biladi" 
[English: my country]. The report includes an interview with 
the factory's chief engineer, Qays Hanna Dawud. 
  Asked why the factory was an allied target, Dawud says 
everyone in the West knew the factory was built by a French 
company at a cost of $35 million and was completed in 1984, 
"however, the foreign company failed to operate the factory to 
produce milk according to the required specifications. So the 
factory remained inactive until 1990 when attempts were made by 
the General Establishment for Milk Products, which is currently 
in charge of the factory, to find solutions to those technical 
problems. The French, who were among the aggressor states, knew 
that it was a baby milk factory." 
  Asked about the connection between U.S. companies and the 
factory, Dawud says that the U.S. "Wyath Company" was approached 
to modify the factory designs, that a team of experts from that 
company had actually visited the factory, and that an Iraqi 
delegation led by the late Ghassan Ibrahim, director general of 
the General Establishment for Milk Products, was actually in the 
United States on 2 August 1990 to sign a contract with the U.S. 
company. The contract dealt with operating the factory and 
using the trademark of the Wyath Company, which produces the 
children's powdered milk brands: "SMA" and "S-26." Dawud notes: 
"This secret, which has been revealed by AL-THARAH for the first 
time, serves as categorical proof that the Americans and the 
French knew that it was a factory for producing milk for 
children." 
  Asked about the damage caused to the factory, Dawud says the 
factory sustained 95 percent damage and that allied aircraft 
"made use of the information and the visit by the American 
delegation of six experts, who came to inspect the factory and 
make their technical assessments before the departure of the 
Iraqi delegation to the United States. This was in addition to 
the maps the French had." 
  Dawud concludes: Under orders from President Saddam Husayn, 
the Corporation for the Implementation of Food and Medical 
Projects, an affiliate of the Military Industrialization 
Organization, began reconstruction work on the factory on 1 
April 1992. Foreign companies were contacted for assistance, 
but they refused to provide the equipment needed. So the teams 
of the Military Industrialization Organization relied on their 
own initiatives and skills and reconstructed the factory, which 
was reopened on 21 January 1993, the second anniversary of its 
bombing.

  [Text] In appreciation of glorious Iraqi women and the 
magnificent role they have played in the course of many long 
years of struggle waged by great Iraq, and to share with Iraqi 
women their celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the 
General Union of Iraqi Women, beloved leader President Saddam 
Husayn, may God protect him, today called on the premises of the 
General Union of Iraqi Women, where he met with Mrs. Manal Yunus 
'Abd-al-Razzaq, president of the General Union, and several 
comrade members of the union's Executive Bureau. 
  The president of the union briefed the president on some of 
the activities carried out by the union. She also reviewed some 
of the accomplishments the union has made since its inception 25 
years ago. 
  Then, the gift from the glorious Iraqi women was presented 
to 
the leader president. The gift was an artwork, an Arab shield 
engraved in genuine Kufic calligraphy. On the shield is written 
the invocation: In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most 
Merciful. It is also engraved with the Iraqi flag and some of 
the statements made by the leader president about Iraqi women. 
  With the presentation of the union's gift, the following 
address was given: O most magnanimous person, and knight in 
times of distress, you have always been the best loyal brother. 
You have always demonstrated matchless compassion, care, and 
guidance. You have always been the strongest shield and sword 
defending the honor of his kinsfolk. You have never feared 
censure or blame. Thanks to you, and to your jihad, Iraqi women 
have continued to hold their heads high, and their principles 
pertaining to right and faith have remained unshakable. Their 
continued support for your blessed banner has remained the 
epitome of the loyalty of honest sisters to their noble brother. 
  Afterward, the leader president left the premises of the 
union. He was bidden farewell by Mrs. Manal Yunus 
'Abd-al-Razzaq, comrade members of the Executive Bureau of the 
General Union of Iraqi Women, as well as the glorious women who 
happened to be on the union premises. They all demonstrated 
jubilation and uttered trilling cries of joy.

<F P=106> [Article by Malik Mansur: "Iranian Rulers are Treacherous </F>
Revanchists in the Service of Washington"] 
  [Excerpts] By the conclusion of the cease-fire on 28 
February 1991 between Iraq and the coalition, Washington had 
already agreed with the Iranian rulers on the final touches for 
an Iranian role to further pursue the military chapter of this 
U.S.-Nato-Zionist aggression. The evil ayatollahs in Tehran had 
been eagerly awaiting any opportunity to take revenge on Iraq 
and its historic leadership for their miserable defeat in the 
second Iraq-Iran War. [passage omitted] 
  What tempted the Iranian rulers to blindly pursue their evil 
delusions and mean intentions was the Iraqi Army's preoccupation 
with the potential invasion by the allied forces. Thus, the 
Iranian role was to stab the Iraqi fighters in the back in a 
premeditated act that was motivated by hypocrisy and misguided 
policies. It was an act carrying all the meanings of treachery, 
hatred, meanness, and cowardice, displaying a complete lack of 
morals or honorable values. [passage omitted] 
  In order to conceal their collusion with Washington, the 
Tehran rulers resorted to their known methods of maneuvering and 
cheating. They pursued a strange line showing a contradiction 
between the policies and stands announced over the media -- 
which appeared neutral and opposed to the U.S. and Western 
military buildup and military aggression on Iraq -- and the 
actual practices and stands of those rulers -- which in 
substance and results harmed Iraq, especially its policies and 
stands, and cast aspersions about its historic leadership. 
  The timing of the Iranian role was important. The 
ayatollahs' deceptive role was to express verbal opposition to 
the U.S. military aggression against Iraq and at the same time 
turn the Iranian media into an active supporter for the 
propaganda and psychological warfare against Iraq and its people 
by casting doubts by devious means about Iraq's policy and the 
soundness and correctness of the stands of its historic 
leadership. The general tone of the Iranian media during the 
aggression was inciteful at times and subtle at others. [passage 
omitted] 
  Following Iraq's final victory by tearing up the chapter of 
treachery and treason in record time, which caused the enemies 
to lose their senses and balance, and the introduction of 
measures marked by a high degree of national responsibility, 
wisdom, and ability, the march of steadfastness and challenge in 
our country proceeded with vigor. More opportunities were given 
to pool the Iraqi people's inventive and creative resources for 
the counter-offensive of reconstructing what the aggressors had 
destroyed, for rebuilding life in Iraq, and for moving to the 
new phase of steadfastness and resistance against the blockade 
and the conspiratorial plans. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 9 Mar (INA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
says that the visit Pope John Paul II is expected to make to 
Iraq will be an opportunity for him to implicitly reaffirm the 
Christian world's rejection of U.S. imperialist and Zionist 
plans to wage new wars. 
  Commenting on statements by Iraqi Chaldean Catholic 
Patriarch 
Rufa'il Bidawid I to the effect that the Pope has promised to 
visit Iraq at the appropriate time, the paper today, in an 
article contributed by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar, adds that 
a positive stand by the Pope now could make an effective 
contribution to thwarting attempts to spark such wars. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH goes on to say that the neo-imperialists have 
chosen Iraq as a target for their vindictiveness, and as a major 
springboard for sparking wars designed to last hundreds of years 
by inflicting colossal harm that will not be forgotten by Iraq, 
the Arabs, or the Muslims. This harm engenders vengeance. 
  The paper says: Iraq is determined to shed light on the 
unreligious motives for this Western hostility toward the Arabs 
and Muslims. However, Iraq's efforts in this regard need to be 
supported by efforts from other camps, which the United States 
wants to wage the war against Iraq. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH adds: The Pope can play a role in thwarting 
the scheme of Western imperialism. A visit by the Pope to Iraq 
would address a clear message to all, telling them that 
Christianity has nothing to do with capitalism's covetousness 
and criminal schemes, and that Islam and Christianity have 
coexisted without wars for thousands of years, and that there is 
no reason for this coexistence to be discontinued. 
  The paper asserts that a visit by the Pope would also be a 
message to the Iraqi people, telling them that Christians have 
nothing to do with their suffering, that they are sympathetic to 
their ordeal, and that they want to see the embargo lifted. 
  The paper hopes that the visit by the Pope will be made 
before the embargo clamped on the Iraqi people is lifted, 
because the timing of the visit is immensely significant. This 
is because the visit must encourage the countries of the 
Christian world to take bolder steps to lift the embargo, or 
push for a lifting of the embargo. 
  The paper concludes by noting the failure of the Bush 
administration to dominate the world in the name of the new 
world order. The paper adds that there are currently moves 
toward a new stratagem even more horrible and criminal than 
Bush's, namely, that of pushing the world into the crematorium 
of ethnic and religious wars in a bid to make them the bases for 
future conflicts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran-America Relations"] </F>
  [Text] Talks, comments and features on Iran-America 
relations are heard and seen in the western media quite often 
these days. Last Thursday the Islamic Republic of Iran News 
Agency (IRNA) reported, without quoting the source, that Mr. 
Robert Pelletreau, undersecretary of state for Near Eastern 
affairs had said that Washington did not intend to subvert the 
Islamic government in Iran and that it was ready to sit down 
with Iranian officials and discuss outstanding issues on which 
Tehran and Washington have different views. Mr. Pelletreau was 
also quoted as saying that the political system in Iran is here 
to stay for a long time to come. 
  It has been noticed that the subject of Iran-America 
relations is usually raised when some tragic event occurs in the 
Muslim world. For instance, the topic was widely discussed in 
the western media simultaneously with the signing of an accord 
in Washington last September between Mr. Yasir 'Arafat and Mr. 
Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist state. 
  And now we hear the same story told by a different person 
after the slaughter of more than 60 Palestinian worshipers at 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil (Hebron). 
  This might have been done with the intention of diverting 
attention of the people of Iran from vital issues and maybe for 
conveying a message to its officials that if they should look 
the other way, they would be compensated. 
  Nevertheless, the official stance of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran on this issue has been made known on many occasions. The 
last time it was done was by the leader of the Islamic 
Revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who said on the 14th 
anniversary of the seizure of the former U.S. Embassy by Muslim 
students in Tehran that, "The Iranian nation does not need to 
negotiate, or have relations with an arrogant enemy such as 
America." 
  Anyway, if Washington is sincere in its aims to reconcile 
differences with a big Muslim country in the Middle East the 
easiest way would be to settle all financial matters with Iran. 
The first step Clinton's administration can take is release all 
Iranian assets that were frozen by the former U.S. president 
Jimmy Carter. The next step would be to attend to other issues 
of dispute between America and Iran such as the downing of the 
passenger airliner in the Persian Gulf. These and several other 
points can be negotiated and a solution found to end the 
animosity between Iran and America. But will the U.S. ever be 
able to keep aside its arrogance? Will it realize that a 
revolutionary nation can never be forced to yield by arrogance, 
threats and baseless accusations such as international terrorism 
and violation of human rights?

  [Text] In the wake of recent comments of Egyptian President 
Husni Mubarak accusing Iran of involvement in the assassination 
plot of the Egyptian prime minister, 'Atif Sidqi, last October, 
Iran's Foreign Ministry has reacted sharply. 
  In the same connection, Mr. Morteza Sarmadi, the spokesman 
of 
the Foreign Ministry, yesterday strongly denied the charge, and 
he expressed regret that the president of a country has asserted 
such baseless and unfounded comments merely on the strength of 
fabricated and distorted information against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Comments of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak 
against Iran have appeared in his recent interview carried by 
the Kuwaiti-based daily of AL-QABAS. These say that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, by paying $13,000 to an Egyptian terrorist, 
has allegedly tried to kill the Egyptian prime minister. 
  In the opinion of political observers, baseless charges 
leveled by Egypt against the Islamic Republic of Iran are not 
viewed as new development. It is not for the first time that 
political and propaganda circles have sought, by making use of 
such a tactic and without presenting any acceptable reason and 
evidence, to distort Iran's political image in the region. 
  In fact, this attempt by leaders of the Egyptian regime, 
aimed at creating an atmosphere of distrust against Iran in the 
region in political terms, is a move which can supplement the 
U.S. policies in the area. This is the point that the Egyptian 
president and the politicians of that country have often clearly 
stressed during their meetings with the U.S. officials. The 
regional media affiliated to the West too have added fuel to the 
fire and have tried to project in the region an image of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, which because of its opposition to the 
so-called Middle East peace plan is interfering in the internal 
affairs of the regional countries, including Egypt, and in 
certain instances, as the Egyptian president has said it, has 
even attempted to assassinate the prime minister of that country. 
  This is a fact that the Cairo leaders are fully aware of the 
weak points and the vulnerable foundation of the ruling system 
in Egypt; and the world people, who are daily witnessing the 
suppression of the opponents of the Egyptian regime by the state 
elements, are quite sensible to think about what is going on in 
that country. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand the 
motive of the Egyptian regime in deviating the public opinion 
and linking the country's critical situation to beyond the 
Egyptian borders. 
  This should, however, be reminded [as heard] that the 
Islamic 
Republic of Iran considers it very essential to counter this 
propaganda firmly, since it is considered as a kind of political 
assassination committed against a country on the international 
and regional scene. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
will never allow the use of various tactics for destroying the 
climate of confidence towards the Islamic Republic of Iran in 
the region and not allow the use of these tactics as a tool to 
further the common design of the Egyptian regime and the U.S. in 
the region.

  [Text] Tehran, March 9, IRNA -- Majles Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri said on Wednesday that the whole 
world of Islam is concerned about the question of Palestine and 
called on Muslim states to rise up to salavage Qods. 
  Speaking in the open session of the Majles, he said the 
problem of Palestine was not a merely Palestinian question but 
rather "an ideological issue for the whole Islamic ummah". 
  He called on world Muslims to actively take part in the Qods 
day rally which is staged worldwide on the last Friday of the 
fasting month of Ramadan. "Our message to other Muslims and 
other Islamic states is that they should take to the streets and 
express their indignation against the recent crime of the 
Zionist regime at the Ibrahim (peace be upon him) mosque in the 
town of Hebron". 
  Referring to the crime of Zionists against a group of 
Palestinian worshippers, he said the event must have cleared it 
for world Muslims that if they took a step back, the occupiers 
would be encouraged to continue their crimes. 
  The Gaza-Jericho accord made Israel so impudent that it 
embarked on letting the blood of the children of Islam in the 
fasting month of Ramadan. 
  "The fact that we can not come to terms with the United 
States today is that the U.S. as the ring leader of the 
hegemonic powers has the same nature that the Zionsits have," 
the speaker remakred. 
  The United Nations and the Security Council and the 
so-called 
advocates of human rights who interfere in the internal affirs 
of other countries under any pretexts, have kept silent on the 
massacre of Palestinians in al-Khalil, he regretted. 
  He said that without a unified and all-out movement on the 
part of world Muslims the "cancerous tumor" (Israel) cannot be 
removed from the heart of Palestine. The Muslim people of 
Palestine should get rid of the Zionists, he stressed.

  [Text] This week talks were held between the Tajik 
opposition and the Russian deputy foreign minister in Tehran. 
The talks, which were initiated by the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, had significant outcomes for the solution of the 
Tajikistan crisis. To inform you of the views of the Tajikistan 
opposition, the following are remarks by Akbar Turjanzadeh, head 
of the Tajik opposition delegation to the talks, from an 
interview with our correspondent: 
  [Begin Turjanzadeh recording, in Tajik] The outcome of our 
talks was good because the basic preconditions we had set before 
holding any talks with the regime in Dushanbe were met and we 
held a meeting with a high-ranking Russian envoy, Anatoliy 
Adamishin, in Tehran. 
  Our basic preconditions for holding talks in Moscow were 
that 
the full security of the participants in the talks be ensured 
and that observers and mediators from Iran, Russia, Pakistan, 
and Afghanistan be present. Russia did not formally accept this 
precondition. But after two days of talks, Russia accepted this 
precondition. 
  In the talks that will be held in Moscow and then in Tehran 
or other countries, we will discuss topics; the most important 
ones are the creation of an interim government council 
consisting of neutral personalities who did not participate in 
this fratricide, the complete disarmament of both sides, and the 
holding of free elections two years after the establishment of 
tranquility and stability in Tajikistan with the participation 
of various parties. [end recording] 
  As far as efforts by the Islamic Republic of Iran in solving 
the Tajikistan crisis, Morteza Bank, director general of the 
East European Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry, said: 
  [Begin Bank recording] Various steps have been taken by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran within this period. The most important 
step was coordination and cooperation with the United Nations 
and representatives of the UN secretary general, with whom we 
held very good talks during their two visits to Tehran. Also, 
our diplomatic mission in Tajikistan was extremely active in 
this issue and was able to inform the UN representative of the 
situation inside Tajikistan. 
  Another effort was our continuous contacts with important 
regional countries, namely Russia, including the visit by the 
Russian foreign minister to Tehran, the two visits by the 
special envoy of the Russian president to Tehran, and the visit 
by the Russian deputy foreign minister to Tehran. We held 
extremely good and detailed talks with these officials, who were 
briefed on the views of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  We also had continuous contacts with the Tajik Government, 
met with Tajik officials--the president and the foreign 
minister--in various sessions, such as the Economic Cooperation 
Organization [ECO] session in Istanbul and the ECO session in 
Tehran, and discussed various viewpoints. And finally, a strong 
contact was established with the opposition--both the national 
faction and especially the Islamic faction. [end recording]

  [Text] The recent crisis in Indian-Pakistani relations over 
the problem of Kashmir has died down with mediation by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Some weeks ago, Pakistan called for 
the issuance of a resolution on the violation of human rights by 
India in Kashmir. Our correspondent Hajiparvaneh, who is in 
Paris, interviewed our country's representative at the UN Human 
Rights Commission on this step by the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Sirus Naseri said in relation to this: 
  [Begin recording] [Naseri] Many countries--Islamic and 
Western countries and, as far as we know, Britain, Australia, 
and others--tried to bring about an understanding between India 
and Pakistan in some way or another. But three or four days ago 
all of them gave up, concluding that there was no way out and 
that these two countries would move toward a confrontation, and 
decided to issue a resolution on Kashmir. 
  However, our diplomatic machinery not only did not give up 
but it increased its efforts. I should say that with the 
multifaceted efforts of our Foreign Ministry, directives issued 
by the president himself, the direct participation of our 
foreign minister, and the activities that we carried out in 
Islamabad and New Delhi, at the last moment we achieved 
something that all the members of the commission thought to be 
impossible--Iran was able to pave the way for reconciliation 
between the two countries on this issue within an extremely 
logical framework. 
  The result was, I think, also a victory for Pakistan and 
India because contrary to the tension that they were moving 
toward, tranquility has been suddenly established, which we hope 
can pave the way for the resumption of talks between the two 
countries on the resolution of their problems. This was a 
success for the Kashmiri Muslims because within this framework 
India allowed representatives of some Islamic countries to 
inspect the area to see the actual situation; if they observe 
that Muslims are in need of something or that human rights are 
being violated, they will discuss this with the Indian 
Government so that the situation will improve. 
  I think that this was an extremely significant issue for 
Iran 
because of the credibility it was able to gain by being able to 
complete an extremely difficult political task that all the 
others who are so boastful about their abilities were unable to 
do anything about and gave up. Probably an extremely 
outstanding outcome of this development is that everything 
worked contrary to the opinion of the Westerners, especially the 
United States, which very flagrantly announced a couple of days 
ago that the commission's attention should be focused on Iraq 
and especially Iran, and whose hostile policies toward Iran have 
been extremely obvious, especially during the past few years. 
And exactly on the same day that they exerted all their efforts 
to issue a resolution against us, Iran emerged as probably the 
most popular and most outstanding member of the commission. 
  [Hajiparvaneh] Our country's permanent ambassador at the 
European headquarters of the United Nations talked about the 
resolution on human rights in Iran, which the Commission issued 
under pressure by Western countries: The approval of such 
resolutions is customary and has assumed such a political nature 
that it is no longer attractive to anyone and is only a pretext 
for the West's propaganda against Iran. He added: More 
realistic countries are well aware of the depth of such actions 
and are aware of how hostility and spite by the West, especially 
the United States, are involved in such actions; out of the 52 
members of the UN Human Rights Commission, 30 of them either 
abstained or voted against this resolution. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Human Rights Commission [HRC] rapporteur on 
Iran, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, by issuing his report on our 
country's human rights record, once again proved that the UN 
pursues a policy of double standards and exploits the human 
rights issue as a political lever. 
  From time to time Mr. Galindo Pohl releases a report on the 
human rights records in Iran to conclude a phase of his mission. 
However, his mission is to keep alive the issue of human rights 
violations in Iran by resorting to every possible means. For 
this purpose he compiles the false and biased reports of the 
Western press, affiliated to international Zionism, and presents 
them to the HRC as a report. 
  Throughout his life Galindo Pohl has witnessed blatant and 
gross violation of human rights by U.S. imperialism and its 
local agents in his country, Central America. Nevertheless, he 
refers to the fatwa of killing Salman Rushdie, the apostate 
author of the book The Satanic Verses as violation of 
human rights. He mistakes freedom of speech with freedom to 
offend and violate sanctities. 
  Galindo Pohl is alway touring Europe. He should therefore 
know better: If anyone, in whatever status, were to attribute 
something to a Jewish personality or comment on a historical 
issue that does not please the Jews, they would raise their hue 
and cry. For instance, some time ago a member of France's 
National Front, who fought Hitler's occupation forces and lost 
an eye in a battle, said: The German gas chambers were only a 
minor part of the history of World War II. The Jews dragged him 
to a court on charges of undermining Jewish suffering, and 
obtained a verdict against him. Now Mr. Galindo Pohl ignores 
insults against the Prophet of a religion representing more than 
one fifth of the world population. 
  In reality, if any organization or state were to be 
condemned 
for violating human rights, the United States and the Security 
Council should be condemned. Since Friday the sixth of Esfand 
[25 February], when dozens of worshipers were massacred in the 
holy shrine of Ibrahim in Hebron, the Security Council has not 
yet made any decision to issue a resolution condemning the 
Israeli regime. Even if such a resolution were to be passed, it 
would be a waste of ink and paper as it would fail to achieve 
anything. So far the HRC has only expressed regret on the 
matter, and the U.S. Government's only concern has been the 
peace talks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After nearly 100 hours of debate in the Majles open 
sessions on the state budget bill for 1373 [year beginning 21 
March 1994], the second reading of the bill was completed and 
the bill was referred to the Guardian Council for review. 
  According to a report by a Central News Unit correspondent, 
on the basis of the articles and notes appended to next year's 
state budget bill -- approved in today's open session -- 50 
billion rials will be put at the disposal of the fund for 
interest-free loans for supporting employment opportunities, to 
be spent on creating new job opportunities and maintaining 
existing employment throughout the country. 
  Also all public and private establishments are to obtain a 
certificate of the nonexistence of domestic production and 
domestic know how from the Nuclear Energy Organization prior to 
any purchase from abroad of radiation materials [mavvad-e 
partowza] or equipment dealing in any way with ionizing or 
non-ionizing radiation. 
  According to a Majles decision today, ministries, public 
organs, establishments, and companies are empowered to pay a 
maximum of 40,000 rials per day as mission allowance to those 
sent on foreign missions providing the travel expenses incurred 
are not personal. [sentence as heard] Any other payments, or 
the receipt of any other payments, whether in rials or foreign 
currency, is forbidden and shall be construed as illegal 
appropriation of public assets. 
  Our correspondent adds: The 1373 budget bill was presented 
to 
the Majles on 21 December 1993 and since then it has been under 
review by various Majles commissions, especially the Plan and 
Budget Commission. The bill was debated and approved in Majles 
open sessions in two stages: first the section on income and 
then the expenditure section. 
  The Majles is to hold an open session on the morning of 12 
March to discuss the Guardian Council's views on the 1373 state 
budget bill.

  [Text] Tehran, March 9, IRNA -- Finance Minister Morteza 
Mohammad-Khani and German Ambassador to Tehran Reinhold Schenk 
here today emphasized the need for expansion of mutual 
cooperation in the areas of trade, joint ventures and transfer 
of technology. 
  Mohammad-Khani elaborating on the payment of the Iranian 
debts to Germany said Iran is interested to use technical 
assistance of the friendly countries including Germany. 
  He also expressed hope that Germany would purchase a higher 
volume of the Iranian non-oil commodities. 
  Schenk in reply said his country is also keen to expand its 
political, economic and cultural ties with Iran. 
  Establishment of a German language training center which 
would be affiliated to the Irano-German Chamber of Commerce, 
would pave the way for the expansion of cultural and trade 
relations between the two countries, he added.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordanian official reaction differed over His 
Majesty King Husayn's return from Saudi Arabia at dawn Wednesday 
[9 March] without holding an expected meeting with Saudi King 
Fahd to mend fences after three years of strained ties. 
  Reactions here varied from resigned pragmatism to anger and 
disappointment that an opportunity to reconciliate Arab ranks 
after the Gulf war was not made use of. 
  The King, who was officially reported to be going to Mecca 
and Medina on the holiest day of Ramadan to perform 'Umra, 
returned to Amman at 02:00 a.m. Wednesday morning. 
  Officials have been careful not to play up the visit's 
political value and stressed the King's wish to be at the 
Prophet's burial place in Medina on Laylat al-Qadr--the night of 
destiny--which, according to Islam, is the night when the skies 
are opened to receive worshippers' prayers. 
  Privately, however, politicians and anaylsts had expressed 
hope that the visit would be an opportunity to break the 
deadlock in relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia which 
resulted from the 1990 Gulf crisis. 
  A well-placed source told the JORDAN TIMES that King Husayn 
was aware that his trip to Mecca and Medina was to be a "purely 
spiritual visit." 
  The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no 
political significance or hopes should have been attached to 
this short trip except that a "psychological barier" had been 
removed with the King's insistence on the visit despite 
continued tension in political relations between him and the 
Saudi monarch. 
  "The King's insistence on performing 'Umra was a duty he 
felt 
as a Muslim," the source said adding that "this was a religious 
trip and not a political one... there should be no 
disappointment." 
  "A psychological barrier, if one is to think politically, 
has 
definitely been removed," the source said, explaining that while 
King Husayn had previously stayed away from the Islamic holy 
shrines because of the political situation between the two 
countries "he was able to break that barrier" with Tuesday's 
trip. 
  But the source conceded that had the two kings been able to 
meet and resolve some of their differences "it would have been 
differences "it would have been perfect." 
  However, other officials, who also acknowledge that the king 
had no scheduled meeting with the Saudi monarch before he left 
for 'Umra, did not hide their disappointment. 
  "The attitude by the Saudis was definitely negative and not 
conducive to reconciliation," said a senior official. 
  "When interests of states are at risk, top state officials 
should rise above personal disputes," he added. 
  Western diplomats here concur with the disappointed 
officials. Analysts describe the Saudi decision as "counter 
productive." 
  News agencies quoted Saudi diplomats as saying that while 
they had been told by Jordanian officials that there was no 
scheduled meeting between the two monarchs, "the royal court 
only informed us that the King wanted to perform 'Umra," a 
senior Saudi diplomat, who refused to be identified, was quoted 
as saying by the AP. "There was no request for any high-level 
meetings." 
  A source close to the palace said there was no attempt by 
the Saudis to make any high-level contact with the King or any 
member of his delegation. 
  "We are very disappointed," said the source. "The King was 
reaching out in reconciliation but King Fahd did not respond." 
  Although neither Jordan nor Saudi Arabia officially 
confirmed 
a reconciliation meeting, official sources had privately said 
that the two kings were to meet Tuesday for the first time since 
the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in 1990. 
  Relations between the two kingdoms soured after Iraq invaded 
Kuwait in Aug. 1990 when Jordan refused to join Saudi-based 
U.S.-led multinational forces that drove Iraq out of Kuwait. 
  Jordan, at the time, declared that while it condemned Iraq's 
takeover of its smaller neighbour Kuwait it felt that the 
problem had to be contained within Arab ranks. 
  King Husayn conducted a shuttle diplomacy between Iraq and 
Egypt immediately after the invasion, trying to withhold an Arab 
League condemnation of Iraq with Iraqi leadership promises that 
he was ready to withdraw from Kuwait. 
  His attempts to contain the problem within Arab ranks, 
however, failed when the Arab League voted to condemn Iraq 
despite earlier promises to withhold the decision. 
  Saudi Arabia, enraged by the Jordanian position, responded 
by 
cutting off much-needed economic aid to Jordan and discontinued 
its fuel supplies to the country. 
  Relations suffered a serious setback and diplomatic missions 
between the two countries have operated with minimum staff since 
that time. 
  Officials here hoped that a meeting between the two monarchs 
would have turned a new page in bilateral relations. 
  "The Saudis had told us that the King was welcome to perform 
the 'Umra but that there was to be no scheduled meeting with 
King Fahd," a senior official said. 
  "Yet we were hopeful that this meeting would be arranged by 
the time King Husayn arrived in Saudi Arabia," the senior 
official added. 
  Analysts believed that King Fahd's decision to meet 
Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Yemeni leader 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih was an "encouraging" sign that the Saudi 
leadership would also move to normalise relations with Jordan. 
The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Yemen adopted a 
similar position to that of Jordan after the Aug. 2 Invasion. 
  Amman's ties with most of the Gulf states, except Saudi 
Arabia and Kuwait, have improved especially with Qatar, the 
United Arab Emirates and Oman. 
  Officially, Jordan was careful not to raise hopes by 
stressing that the King's visit on Tuesday was for purely 
religious reasons but sources had also revealed that an advance 
team from the palace was sent a week before the King's trip to 
arrange for the meeting. 
  King Fahd normally grants courtesy audiences to most heads 
of 
state visiting his country on pilgrimage. 
  Some analysts here now expect relations between Jordan and 
Saudi Arabia to worsen after King Fahd's "rebuff." 
  "At best Jordan will try to contain the problem," said one 
analysts. "But the King will not try such a gesture again. He 
has gone out of his way." 
  Other analysts, however, disagree and say that there were no 
high expectations of reconciliation at this time and that things 
will just have to "take their own pace."

  [Text] Jordan's King Husayn returned to Amman today after 
performing the minor pilgrimage in Mecca. Attention has been 
drawn to the fact that Saudi King Fahd refrained from receiving 
King Husayn, who visited Saudi Arabia for the first time for 
four years. Our correspondent in Amman, Randah Habib, has this 
report on the interpretations heard in Amman today on this lost 
opportunity to normalize relations between Amman and Riyadh: 
  [Begin Randah Habib recording] The meeting, which did not 
take place between Jordan's King Husayn and Saudi King Fahd 
during the former's visit to Mecca, echoed Saudi Arabia's 
refusal to normalize its relations with Jordan--relations that 
deteriorated during the Gulf crisis. The Jordanian officials, 
however, emphasize that King Husayn's visit was confined to 
performing the minor pilgrimage in a holy place that is open to 
all Muslims and that Jordan has not requested a meeting with any 
party. Nevertheless, Amman, according to the same officials, 
would have appreciated some cordial gesture by the Saudis. 
  Diplomats in Jordan had expected a Saudi-Jordanian summit 
during the king's visit, the first in about four years. A 
Western diplomat today said the failure to hold a summit was 
considered an insult, which is not characteristic of Arab 
tradition, nor is it common for a head of state. He described 
King Husayn's visit as an outstretched hand, extended to shake 
the hand of the Saudis. [end recording]

  [Text] The State Security Court's public prosecutor has 
begun to interrogate 30 defendants in connection with the recent 
bombings in Amman and al-Zarqa' as a prelude to trying them 
before the State Security Court soon. 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B has learned that preliminary investigations 
have shown that these defendants received aid from a foreign 
country and were trained in the use of weapons in Afghanistan. 
They planned to carry out acts of sabotage in the Kingdom in 
order to destabilize the country and obstruct Jordan's 
democratic march. 
  The public prosecutor accused all defendants of possessing 
and using explosives and automatic weapons and joining an 
illegal organization. It is noteworthy that the competent 
security organs recently confiscated some weapons and explosives 
in the possession of these defendants.

  [Text] The leaders of the Islamic Action Front and the 
Pan-Arab Action Front Party issued a joint statement yesterday 
unifying their positions on promoting common action to face the 
imperialist-Zionist onslaught and crystallize a plan to set up 
an Arab and Islamic front. 
  The two parties pledged to work together to foil all 
policies 
and programs promoting capitulation, particularly since these 
policies are hostile to the the Arab nation's and the Islamic 
people's right to independence, to a decent life, and to 
struggle to defeat the aggression that targets the nation's 
existence and honor. 
  The two parties also asserted the need to unify all 
national, 
pan-Arab, and Islamic forces and mobilize all the resources of 
the masses of our nation in the Arab and Islamic arenas to 
oppose all forms of capitulation and normalization. 
  They decided to form a joint committee to devise a mechanism 
of action, care for the affairs of citizens, and work to 
safeguard national unity and enhance cohesion between the sons 
of the homeland.

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Differences have openly 
and officially erupted within the Islamic Action Front [IAF] in 
Jordan after a law suit was filed and a reply to it by three 
deputies was released in Amman yesterday. 
  The law suit was filed by IAF Executive Committee Member 
Ziyad Abu-Ghunaymah against three IAF deputies -- Hamzah Mansur, 
'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Akkur, and Dr. Mahmud 'Uwaydah -- who in turn 
issued a memorandum refuting Abu-Ghunaymah's claims. 
  The three deputies -- Mansur, who is considered to be the 
IAF 
spokesman, is the most prominent among them -- addressed a 
memorandum to House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri, 
ministers, deputies, and public opinion, repudiating the points 
made in Abu-Ghunaymah's complaint. 
  IAF sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the swift 
expulsion of Abu-Ghunaymah from the IAF and the Muslim 
Brotherhood has something to do with the political conflicts 
between the hawks and doves of the Islamic movement and the 
moderate stance taken by the IAF in relation to those who took 
part in the parliamentary elections. 
  In their memorandum, the three deputies said that the 
disagreement was mainly over the cancellation of Abu-Ghunaymah's 
candidacy for a seat in the House of Representatives because he 
was not unanmously supported in his constituency. 
  In his law suit against the three deputies, Abu-Ghuanymah 
requested that they should be stripped of their parliamentary 
immunity and brought to trial on charges of slander and 
defamation. 
  The problem originally started before the parliamentary 
elections in Jordan when the IAF preempted a number of 
candidates including Abu-Ghunaymah. It later transpired that 
the disagreement was over admission of new IAF members who were 
not acceptable to the IAF leadership itself. 
  Informed sources say that Abu-Ghunaymah's weight and 
influence in the IAF and the Muslim Brotherhood should not be 
underestimated, particularly among the young generation eager to 
operate in ways not acceptable to the traditional leadership. 
  The sources expect these differences to affect the unity of 
the Muslim Brotherhood, particularly as Abu-Ghunaymah runs the 
Muslim Brotherhood's Islamic Hospital and comes from northern 
Irbid, where his family is very influential and where the Muslim 
Brotherhood has a following which is bound to be affected by 
Abu-Ghunaymah's position.

<F P=106> [By Yasir Abu-Hilalah] </F>
  [Text] An arrest in al-Qasr in al-Karak Governorate has 
raised many questions about what is wanted from Jordan, in 
general, and from the Islamic institutions, in particular. The 
following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of 
witnesses: 
  Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid 
in 
al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small 
carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to 
guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando 
operation against Jews from southern Jordan. 
  'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed. 
The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to 
keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton 
elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a 
mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society. 
Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did 
not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the 
carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al-Majid hid the carton inside 
a storage room that is separate from the house. 
  After that day's fast breaking meal, a group from the 
security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the 
place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the 
place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they 
arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security 
procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed 
the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of 
many witnesses. 
  When the security forces made inquiries, the school's 
administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed 
that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people. 
  The incident did not answer the following questions: How did 
the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security 
forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that 
same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic 
institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why 
weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants' 
houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this 
incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on 
security issues? 
  AL-SABIL met with 'Abd-al-Jalil al-'Awawidah, administrative 
director of the Islamic Center Society, who commented on the 
incident. He said: The Islamic Center Society is a national 
institution that has been offering social, educational, and 
health services for more than 30 years. It plays a commendable 
role in shouldering the country's social burdens. It provides 
social care for thousands of orphans and needy people. It also 
offers educational services to thousands of the homeland's sons 
in the various stages of education as well as health services. 
He added: Throughout these years, not a single legal violation 
was or will be recorded against the society. 
  On the recent arrest, al-'Awawidah said: As for reports 
about a small carton containing military hardware that was found 
inside a kindergarten for the society in al-Karak governorate, 
the society is sure that the person who hid this small carton 
and confessed to the security forces has nothing whatsoever to 
do with the society. He is not a member of the society and he 
does not work there either. Besides, he did not consult any of 
the society's officials and acted on his own responsibility. 
  I do not rule out that he has evil intentions toward the 
society--which is known for its good reputation--or that some 
quarters pushed him to undermine the society--a society that is 
known for its commendable services on the level of the Kingdom. 
This is especially so since the room in which the carton was 
seized is outside the kindergarten and school and has a separate 
door that opens to the main road. 
  Just as the society's administration is concerned about 
providing its educational, health, and social services to all 
people in the kingdom, it spares no effort to keep its branches 
and committees as beacons of the generosity and good that are 
acquired from the Koran and the Sunna of God's prophet, may 
God's peace and blessings be upon him. 
  The defendant's choice of one of the society's 
kindergartens, 
which also includes a mosque, is not surprising. Any public 
place that offers its services to all people--such as the 
mosques of the Ministry of Awqaf, the schools of the Ministry of 
Education, and all the public institutions, whether governmental 
or private--could have been chosen. 
  The final say is for the courts, in terms of who carried out 
this act and whether it was done out of ignorance or ill 
intentions. This confirms that Islamic institutions are targeted 
by quarters hostile to the stability of Jordan, of which the 
Islamists are a pillar. 
  AL-SABIL also met with 'Abdallah al-Majali, the detainee's 
brother, who commented on the incident. He said: I have no 
relation to the al-Faruq Islamic Schools, although I 
contributed, to a large extent, in building these schools, which 
have a special committee linked to the Islamic Center Society. 
He added: The society's facilities play a pioneering role in 
community service. 
  On the recent incident for which his brother was arrested, 
he 
said: His actions were individual and he is responsible for his 
behavior. We do not approve of any act that harms the security 
of the country. He added: The security and stability of the 
country is the responsibility of everyone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, controller </F>
general of the Muslim Brotherhood, by an unidentified reporter 
in Amman; date not given] 
  [AL-SABIL] We have learned that some arrests were made 
within the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. How true 
is this and what is the reason for the arrests? 
  [Khalifah] I do not believe there are any intentions or 
designs against the Muslim Brotherhood on the part of the 
Jordanian Government. After many years of experience, it has 
become evident to all unbiased and informed people that the 
stands of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has existed and worked 
in Jordan for more than half a century, are noble stands aimed 
at spreading a feeling of security, tranquility, and safety. 
This is with the exception of some minor incidents fabricated 
by a handful of evil people who are hired by parties hostile to 
security in this country. 
  As for the issue of arrests, it is not even worth 
mentioning. 
What we know so far is that one of the brothers in the Suwaylih 
branch of the Islamic Brotherhood was arrested. His name is 
'Abd-al-Majid Dayah and he is an engineer. Everything I know 
about him is good. 
  Another person, named 'Abd-al-Majid Ibrahim al-Majali, is 
one 
of the brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood of al-Qasr in 
al-Karak. He was questioned a few months ago when he wanted to 
leave Jordan in order to join the ranks of the mujahidin against 
the communists in Afghanistan. He was held for some time on 
charges of carrying an amount of money to help the mujahidin in 
Afghanistan. At the time, he was not a regular member of the 
Muslim Brotherhood. He was released a few months later. I do 
not remember how long he was detained. 
  I am totally surprised by those who are trying to create 
intrigue and level false accusations against this Islamic 
organization. It has been established in Jordan for more than 
half a century, since the era of the late King 'Abdallah 
Bin-al-Husayn, through the era of the late King Talal, and now 
in the era of King Husayn. Each of them has known that the call 
of the Muslim Brotherhood continues to be that of a reliable aid 
to achieving tranquility and concentrating on Islamic education. 
It is concerned about the security of the country and our 
standing within one solid rank against the enemies inside and 
outside the country. 
  It has been proven through investigations that plotters 
against Islam and its people were behind the cinema 
explosions--attributed to Islamists--and the previous explosions 
in some liquor stores in Jabal Amman and al-Salt. Indeed, this 
is because the method of the Islamic message is in line with 
Almighty God's saying: "Invite all to the way of thy lord with 
wisdom and beautiful preaching." [Koranic verse] It is not the 
method of Islam to attack the defenseless by planting explosives 
in cinemas, coffee shops, and public squares, which only harms 
innocent women, children, and the elderly. 
  The fair investigation of these incidents proved the 
innocence of those from the Muslim Brotherhood who stood accused. 
  Moreover, the investigation proved to all logical people 
that 
these methods are far from the methods of the Muslim 
Brotherhood, which continues to criticize officials and urges 
them to stop all illegal practices, including the spread of 
immoral entertainment, and other violations that could encourage 
the spread of vice. We continue to search for people who will 
listen to these complaints and adopt a stand that limits these 
immoral actions. 
  [AL-SABIL] In light of this, do you believe that there is a 
conspiracy against the Muslim Brotherhood seeking to sow a rift 
between them and the regime in this country, in preparation, God 
forbid, to dealing a blow to democracy in it, particularly since 
the Muslim Brotherhood has an explicit stand on the peace 
process in the region? 
  [Khalifah] The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and in the other 
Arab countries have not changed their clear policy toward the 
Palestinian cause since the establishment of their call, 
although in Islam one greets another by saying: peace be upon 
you. We can never believe that the Jews want peace with the 
inhabitants of Palestine or with the other Arabs. The Muslim 
brothers clearly know this fact, and are also aware of the Jews 
wickedness, machinations, and enmity toward Islam and its 
followers. 
  From this premise, if Palestine is not purged of the filth 
of 
the Jews, it will remain a Trojan horse the colonialist 
countries in Europe and America will use to return colonialism 
to the Arab countries in general, and the Islamic countries in 
particular. The United States has succeeded in arming the state 
of the usurper Jews in Palestine and has transformed it into an 
aircraft carrier to subdue the Arab and Islamic countries. 
Conceding any part of Palestine to the Jews is banned by Islam. 
The jurisprudence based on the Koran and the Sunna stipulates 
the following: If the enemy steps on a single inch of Muslim 
land, every male and female Muslim is duty bound to carry out 
jihad. The woman can even leave her husband's house without his 
permission and the slave without his master's permission. The 
Muslim Brotherhood and others who preach Islam will be 
renouncing their religion if they agree to give any part of 
Palestine to the Jews or the other enemies of God. Palestine and 
Jerusalem can be liberated only if the Arab countries unite and 
adopt a cohesive stand with the other Islamic countries. The 
Jews know this. 
  Therefore, any rumor or machination against the Muslim 
Brotherhood cannot but originate from the Jewish enemy, its 
agents, and its partners in Europe and the United States. 
  King Husayn, who has always called for Arab solidarity and 
Islamic cooperation, and has cautioned against and confronted 
all outside conspiracies against this homeland whose safety he 
has secured thanks to his wise policies and alertness, should 
not pay any attention to any slander campaign or rumor against 
the Islamic movement in our steadfast country. God knows 
intentions.

<F P=106> [Report by Salah Ni'mat: "Jordanian Sources Cast Doubt on </F>
Trial of Defendants Suspected of Blowing Up Trade Center"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman -- Official Jordanian sources yesterday 
cast doubt on the proceedings at the trial of the four 
defendants convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center in New 
York. They said that the jury's decision to convict the four 
defendants on all the charges leveled at them "was based on a 
weak argument and conflicting testimonies that do not rise to 
the level of legal evidence." 
  A source who followed the proceedings of the trial in New 
York told AL-HAYAH that the prosecution in the case, 
representing the U.S. Government, "based its argument on 
circumstantial evidence and a group of unlinked events" in an 
endeavor to convict Muhammad Salamah and Nidal 'Ayyad 
(Jordanians of Palestinian origin) and Mahmud Abu-Halimah and 
Ahmad 'Ajjaj. The source added that the prosecution "reached 
its conclusion about the defendants' implication by producing 
evidence and testimonies that do not rise to the level of 
irrefutable evidence." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The devastated father of a Jordanian convicted in 
the New York World Trade Centre bombing is agonising over why 
his son's lawyer did a volte-face in his summation, which he 
believes led to the conviction of not only his son but also 
another three defendants. 
  Amin Salamah, father of Mohammad Salamah (26), who, along 
with three others, was found guilty by a jury in a New York 
court Friday [4 March], is also bitter that no Jordanian 
organisation or individual stepped forward to help him or advise 
him. 
  He said he had obtained a three-month-valid U.S. visa in 
September, but did not have enough money to buy a ticket to New 
York to visit his son and see whether there was anything he 
could do to help establish his innocence. 
  Mr. Salamah, a retired army lieutenant who hails from Bedia 
village in the West Bank, works for Amman Customs Clearing 
Agency to provide for his family of 11 children younger to 
Mohammad and their mother with his Army pension and a JD 120 
monthly salary. 
  "I did not leave a single known door unknocked," he told the 
JORDAN TIMES. "But there was nobody who was willing to help, 
including those who call themselves human rights activists and 
experts in law." 
  "They had no interest in the case, and many appeared anxious 
not to have anything to do with it," he said. 
  "My question to them is: "Isn't every accused entitled to a 
fair trial? And if so, was my son given a fair trial? Did any 
Jordanian lawyer take the slightest interest to find out whether 
the trial followed the due process of the law?" 
  Mr. Salamah, 51, who fled his village along with his family 
in the 1967 war, believes that neither his son nor any of the 
other three is guilty, and that Israeli agents seeking to 
distort the image of Arabs and Muslims had a hand in the affair 
and entrapped the accused in the case. 
  "My instinct and conscience tells me there is much more to 
the entire affair than we have been told," he said, adding that 
the summation of his son's lawyer, Richard Precht, was the most 
damaging element that led to the guilty verdict. 
  "Throughout the trial, the lawyer was very good and made a 
very good case of Mohammad's defence. But, for some unknown 
reasons, he took a complete turn in the last minute," said Mr. 
Salameh, who lives in Zarqa. 
  "Perhaps he was coerced, pressured or forced into doing 
that," he said. "But it does not change the fact that my son 
and three others now face life in prison." 
  He was referring to Mr. Precht's closing argument that 
Mohammad Salamah was an unwitting victim of another defendant 
who trapped him into taking part in the Feb. 26 explosion at the 
twin-towers. The blast killed six people and injured more than 
1,000. 
  Describing Ramzi Yusuf, an accused who remains at large, as 
an "evil genuis," Mr. Precht asserted that Mohammad Salamah was 
duped by Mr. Yusuf. "Mohammad Salamah was terribly misled, 
terribly manipulated... by a person who came into this country 
with a single mission, to destroy American targets," Mr. Precht 
told the court on Feb. 17. 
  Mr. Precht was the only defence lawer who presented such an 
argument which implied that there was a bomb plot and Mr. 
Salamah was part of it. All others maintained the total 
innocence of their clinets and at least one of them accused Mr. 
Precht of undermining his client's defence. 
  Mr. Salamah said his son contacted him over the phone on 
Thursday, less than 24 hours before the verdict was announced. 
  "He sounded very confident that all would be acquitted," Mr. 
Salamah said. "He told me he would be with us here in a few 
days." 
  "Even the lawyer, who had called me a few days earlier, told 
me the same thing. He said the charges were unfounded and 
unsubstantiated," said Mr. Salamah. 
  The ex-serviceman noted that Mohammad had filed a petition 
to 
the judge that Mr. Precht's incriminatory summation did not 
represent his views and that the lawyer was no longer his legal 
counsel. 
  "But the court decided to accept the lawyer's argument that 
there was no change in his status as Mohammad's counsel," Mr. 
Salamah said. 
  "I don't know why (Precht) did such an injustice to my son, 
who always maintained his innocence and never told the lawyer 
anything of the nature that was presented to the court," said 
Amin Salamah. 
  "My limited knowledge of things tells me a lawyer is not 
supposed to invent things and present them in court on behalf of 
his client," he said. "Where did he get the notion that 
Mohammad had any part, witting or otherwise, in the attack?" 
  Mr. Salamah said his son, who has been in touch with the 
family over the phone from his prison, "always swore by God and 
assured me that he had nothing to do with the bombing and that 
he was never involved in any subversive plots. 
  "I brought up and educated my son, and I believe him."

  [Text] Let us begin [Secretary General of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine] Nayif Hawatimah's story 
where that of the secretary general of another front ends. 
  During his visit [to Jordan] where he met with the prime 
minister, Nayif Hawatimah expressed displeasure with the 
meticulous search of his car. 
  Prime Minister al-Majali explained to Nayif Hawatimah that 
he 
was not personally targeted by this search but that the 
Jordanian security authorities at the border posts have started 
to carefully search all incoming vehicles to Jordan, whether 
private or official. 
  Al-Majali explained to Hawatimah that Jordan was forced to 
do 
this out of its fear that these vehicles might be used to 
transport weapons into Jordan as had taken place with the car of 
George Habash [the secretary general of the Popular Front the 
Liberation of Palestine, PFLP]. 
  The Jordanian version says that during Habash's recent visit 
to Jordan, his car was searched and various types of weapons and 
silencers were found in it. 
  On the other hand, the security forces have stepped up their 
surveillance of all the Jordanian border posts to foil any arms 
smuggling operation, particularly after the two cinema 
explosions.

  [Text] Confirmed information obtained by AL-BILAD says the 
nuclear radiation registered periodically since the Gulf war 
came from a U.S. aircraft carrier, the Saratoga. 
  Indubitable sources said a story that the radiation resulted 
from a defect in the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor was leaked 
by U.S. circles to counter suspicions about the Saratoga by 
blaming the radiation on the Dimona reactor. 
  AL-BILAD obtained the following story on how this radiation 
occurred: The cruise missiles the Saratoga fired at Iraq from 
the Red Sea previously carried nuclear warheads designed to 
strike at the Warsaw Pact states. When the Gulf crisis erupted, 
the nuclear warheads were removed and replaced with conventional 
warheads, but the missiles were still charged with nuclear 
radiation, which has been registered more than once.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F>
Darawshah, in Damascus, by Shmu'el Tal, in Jerusalem, on 7 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tal] Are you in Damascus? 
  [Darawshah] Yes, we are in Damascus. That is a fact. 
  [Tal] How were you received there? 
  [Darawshah] We received a tremendous reception. All 57 
members of the delegation were pleasantly surprised by the warm 
welcome and the expressions of brotherhood here. Our Syrian 
brothers are going out of their way to welcome us and host us. 
They also surprised us with their openness, contrary to 
everything we had heard earlier. We received a warm welcome and 
the delegation members were permitted to go wherever they 
desired. We were told that we could do whatever we wanted and 
meet whomever we desired. During the day we toured the city, we 
conducted a very interesting visit to the 'Amawi mosque and to 
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. MK Talib al-Sani' and myself, 
together with the other members of the delegation, placed a 
large wreath on the Tomb, and the governor of the Damascus 
district also held a large feast in our honor although it is now 
Ramadan. 
  [Tal] Is there any chance of your meeting President al-Asad? 
  [Darawshah] According to the schedule, we will meet 
President al-Asad on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  [Tal] What do you plan on telling him? 
  [Darawshah] First of all, we will issue our condolences on 
the death of his son. That, after all, is the purpose of our 
visit. The president is free, of course, to raise any issue; 
however, we will not initiate such discussion. 
  [Tal] Is the Syrian media covering your visit? 
  [Darawshah] Our visit was extensively reported on Syrian 
television, on the radio, and in the press. The press 
throughout the entire Arab world is extensively covering this 
visit. 
  [Tal] Is the fact that the delegation is from Israel 
highlighted? 
  [Darawshah] Yes, they are aware of this fact and report it. 
Everyone knows who we are and where we came from. 
  [Tal] The media as well? 
  [Darawshah] The media as well. All the correspondents know 
that the delegation includes two Israeli MK's, local council 
heads, university lecturers, public figures, journalists, etc. 
The eight journalists who arrived with the delegation from 
Israel are being permitted to report on things, to ask questions 
and interview people, and to take pictures. 
  [Tal] Is there any chance that you might receive some 
information about the Israeli POW's and MIA's? 
  [Darawshah] I cannot say anything on this matter at the 
present time. 
  [Tal] Did you learn anything about the state of the Jewish 
community in Syria? 
  [Darawshah] We are scheduled to visit the Jewish community, 
meet with the chief rabbi, and visit the main synagogue here. 
We asked permission to conduct such a visit and our Syrian 
hosts immediately agreed. I hope that we will indeed have the 
chance to meet with the Jewish community; however, from all that 
we have heard they are treated exactly like the other Syrian 
citizens. 
  [Tal] MK Darawshah, have you received the impression that 
the Syrian people receive accurate information about the peace 
process? 
  [Darawshah] Look, they listen to Qol Yisra'el in Arabic. 
They watch television and read newspapers. This is not the 
isolated and closed off Syria that people try to portray. We 
have seen that the people here are aware of everything that is 
going on. There is a profound desire to reach a peace agreement 
but a great deal of distrust regarding the intentions and 
positions of the Israeli Government. The Hebron massacre was 
especially painful and infuriated people. 
  [Tal] The massacre probably received wide coverage in Syria. 
What do the members of the delegation, as Israel's 
representatives to some extent, have to say about that? 
  [Darawshah] Well, you know that we also have a position on 
that matter. We are angry. It is no secret that we protest and 
condemn it. On the other hand, we greatly aspire to contribute 
to the peace process. 
  [Tal] Do you explain that the massacre does not reflect a 
phenomenon but was the act of an isolated individual? 
  [Darawshah] I believe that the Syrians are aware of the 
arguments on this matter within Israeli society. There is 
criticism of the Army's actions following the massacre. There 
are daily reports on the incidents in the territories and on the 
fact that more people are killed and wounded every day. This is 
very worrisome. 
  [Tal] Thank you, MK Darawshah. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 March 
reports that "our correspondent Qaysar Qabhah, who is 
accompanying the delegation of Israeli Arabs visiting Damascus, 
reports that PLO official Faruq Qaddumi also visited the Syrian 
capital recently and before leaving left a letter for MK 
Darawshah. MK Darawshah refused to divulge the letter's 
contents."]

  [Text] The Israeli Arab delegation today conferred with 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus. At the end of the 
meeting, the spokesman for the president's bureau said that 
al-Asad thanked the members of the delegation for sharing his 
grief and for their sincere condolences. A short time ago, our 
correspondent 'Ofer Vardi spoke with Knesset Member 
'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, the head of the delegation: 
  [Begin Darawshah recording] It was a good, interesting, and 
lengthy meeting which lasted over two hours. The president 
greeted us with manifest warmth and modesty. Despite the grief 
over the death of his son, he gave us an extraordinary 
reception. He stood up and kissed each one of us, and upon our 
departure he walked me out of the hall and bid farewell to each 
of us. 
  In the meeting, we extended our condolences and discussed 
the 
peace process. He lectured us at length about the Syrian 
position on the peace process. He also welcomed our initiative 
to come to Syria to extend our condolences, and said he regarded 
us as part of the Arab world. At the same time, he emphasized 
that Syria's strategy is one of peace. 
  He said: We are prepared to embrace the formula of full 
peace in exchange for full withdrawal, and we already know what 
kind of peace we want. We want full peace in all its senses, 
but the Israeli Government has not yet defined the kind of 
withdrawal it has in mind. The prime minister speaks about a 
withdrawal on the Golan, rather than from the entire Golan.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Qol Yisra'el Arabic correspondent </F>
Qaysar Kabaha, a member of the Israeli Arab delegation currently 
visiting Damascus -- live] 
  [Text] The delegation's three-hour meeting with President 
al-Asad this afternoon was very warm and lively. President 
al-Asad shook hands and talked with everybody. When we all sat 
down he addressed us like family. Al-Asad said: With the help 
of God, peace will come. We talk about it and the entire world 
talks about it. Syria was the one to start the peace process. 
Since 1973, Syria has been leaning in that direction and agreed 
to accept UN resolutions. He mentioned by name only UN 
Resolution 338, which according to al-Asad refers to withdrawal 
from all the territories and giving the Palestinians back their 
rights. He said there has been no progress since then due to 
the Israeli claim that Syria agreed to the UN resolution because 
it misunderstood the resolution. He said there have been many 
U.S. and Soviet initiatives since 1973, but that the latest U.S. 
peace initiative clearly shows that Syria wants peace on the 
basis of the UN resolutions, which means an Israeli withdrawal. 
The U.S. initiative conforms with that demand, he said. 
  Al-Asad said that one of the reasons for Labor's success in 
the last elections, as he understands it, is its peace slogan. 
After Labor came to power, the atmosphere in the talks 
improved, and they began to discuss issues of principle, but no 
progress has been made. 
  The Syrian president sharply attacked Israeli leaders and 
said that they always make new demands of everybody else. Since 
the start of the peace process, Syria has contributed a great 
deal -- it has always initiated things -- while the Israeli 
Government has contributed almost nothing. Everybody knows that 
Israel has a policy of procrastination, he said. Israel 
participated in the Madrid conference because it was under 
pressure. He presented examples of Israel's foot dragging. 
Al-Asad said: We offered the land-for-peace principle. The 
Israelis said it was good, but not enough. We said okay, we 
will offer a different principle: full withdrawal for full 
peace. They said it is not sufficiently clear and they do not 
know what it really means. There is therefore a general 
impression that Israel is dragging its feet. 
  On the state of Syrian Jewry, President al-Asad said that 
Israel more that anybody else is responsible if any harm comes 
to Syrian Jews. It is true that in the 1970's there were 
restrictions on Syrian Jews, which was vital following the 
establishment of Israel in 1948. We did not take those steps 
because we wanted to exploit them, he said. Syria does not 
deprive anybody; there is freedom of religion and ritual. The 
constraints were limited to ID's, leaving the country, and 
movements inside Syria. In the 1980's, and even before that, we 
understood that there was no justification for continuing those 
procedures. We decided to discontinue restrictions on 5,000 or 
6,000 people because five or six Jews ran away or tried to run 
away. President al-Asad said that he reached the conclusion 
that Syrian Jews are Syrian citizens and lifted the restrictions 
on them. We made life easier for Syrian Jews, but I have 
learned that many of them have returned to Syria, al-Asad said. 
  Another issue al-Asad referred to was that of Israeli MIA's. 
He said that Israel has asked almost the entire world to raise 
the issue with him. Every delegation and VIP that comes to me 
brings a letter and manifesto from the families of Israeli 
MIA's. I understand that it is a humanitarian issue and we 
respect the dignity of man. We always discuss it for moral and 
humanitarian reasons, but one of our officers once asked a U.S. 
Congressional delegation why Israel does not permit us to look 
for our missing, since there are many Syrian MIA's. 
  Al-Asad said that peace is on the agenda and that he wants 
peace, but that what Syria is being offered is inappropriate and 
does satisfy the Arab people. When Israel makes offers with the 
aim of dragging its feet, that means that they do not take the 
concerns of others into account, or that they make light of 
them, or ridicule them. Al-Asad said he is always told to copy 
the late President al-Sadat, but I am not al-Sadat, he said. Do 
any of the international agreements or UN resolutions contain a 
clause that al-Asad has to copy al-Sadat? he asked. In 
reference to peace, he said that Israel has a policy of foot 
dragging and trying to put up obstacles. 
  Al-Asad was asked why he does not agree to meet with Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and when will the peace talks be 
renewed. He said, and I quote: Our delegation is conducting 
negotiations with the Israeli delegation. When they make 
progress we will discuss anything necessary. 
  There was an impromptu news conference tonight at the hotel 
where we are staying with the leader of the Jewish community in 
Damascus. The main speaker was Yusuf Jajati, deputy head of the 
community. 
  [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at 
1800 GMT on 9 March quotes the Committee of Arab Local Councils 
and the Supreme Arab Follow-Up Committee as saying that "Knesset 
Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah's delegation does not represent 
the Israeli Arab community. The spokesmen told our 
correspondent Moti Eden that the delegation at best represents 
the Arab Democratic Party."]

Israeli-Arab delegation in Damascus -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] At 1230 today, President Hafiz al-Asad received a 
delegation of the 1948 Palestinians led by 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah. Members of the delegation offered their condolences 
on the nation's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil 
al-Asad. The president thanked the members of the delegation 
for their noble sentiments and sincere condolences. 
  The president welcomed the members of the delegation. He 
said: Syria is your country. The more brothers are away from 
each other the more they miss each other. When I say that Syria 
is your country, it is not that this is a favor from me, or that 
I expect anything in return, it is a reality. These are our 
feelings regardless of the political and geographical reality. 
  You all know about history and the sentiments of the Syrians 
and their pan-Arab view. All the Arab boundaries we are living 
under are fabricated boundaries and this is a fact. Life itself 
shows the continuation of pan-Arab ties are stronger than any 
other ties. I believe that whoever says otherwise will be 
contradicting history's course and facts, and the development of 
human life. 
  If there are people who claim that this is an exaggeration, 
then they do not at all express the Arab citizens' sentiments 
and logic. There are many nations, not just one, with different 
histories and language that are trying to come closer to each 
other. 
  There has been a great deal of talk about interests during 
this historical stage and in light of international changes. 
This word became a popular term, as if it is everything. We 
say that when we talk about interests, we mean all interests. 
We do not only mean economic interests. We mean economic 
interests as well as mutual sentiments and culture and tradition. 
  The president also spoke about the history of, and 
developments in, the Arab-Israeli conflict. He said that the 
media in Israel always says that Syria is threatening Israel's 
security. He added that even during the peace talks, the 
Israelis talked about this. Some foreigners who visit us talk 
about the Golan and how it is a threat to Israel's security. We 
refer them to the UN Charter and the resolutions of the United 
Nations Truce Supervision Organization dealing with clashes on 
the Syrian-Israeli front since 1948. With the exception of one 
or two resolutions, on which there are differences, there are 
more than one hundred resolutions that condemn Israel. 
  The president talked about the Middle East peace process. He 
said: We hope to God that peace, which we and the world are 
talking about, will be achieved. In fact, Syria is the one that 
opened the door to peace. After the 1973 war, we accepted 
Resolution 338 and its main pillar, Resolution 242. In our 
written interpretation of this resolution to the United Nations 
we said that we accept the resolution on the basis that it means 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and securing the 
rights of the Palestinian Arab people. Meanwhile, Israel did 
not accept Resolution 338 under the pretext that Syria read in 
it something that was not there. In the end, however, they 
agreed to a cease-fire on this basis. 
  We have a strong stand in terms of arguments, resolutions, 
and logic. Our stand does not leave much room for the logic of 
others. You all know that many initiatives have been launched 
since 1973. Finally, there was the U.S. peace initiative, which 
in our opinion was the best initiative -- one that is clear and 
based on the principles that have always been reiterated by the 
Arab side. These principles call for the exchange of land for 
peace, based on Resolutions 242 and 338. We always said that we 
wanted a peace based on the UN Security Council resolutions, 
which stipulate a full withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories, and the rights of the Palestinian Arab people. All 
of this was stressed during our talks with the delegations that 
have visited us from the countries that have contacted us. The 
U.S. initiative came in response to this issue. 
  You recall that before Syria replied to the U.S. 
initiative, Shamir gave his rejection and sent a letter to the 
U.S. President at the time making the rejection clear. As for 
us, after we saw positive points in the initiative, we said that 
we agreed to it. It goes without saying that Shamir was not in 
a good position when we accepted it. At the beginning, Shamir 
believed that by rejecting the initiative, he would be 
obstructing the peace process. But, the reply of Syria and the 
Arab side embarrassed him a great deal and the peace process was 
launched. 
  Shamir and his government stepped down without him ever 
saying to the Americans that he agreed to their initiative. All 
the attempts and efforts of the Americans succeeded only in 
making him agree to participate in the Madrid conference, 
without agreeing to the initiative as a whole. 
  During all the time that Shamir's government remained in 
power, no progress was achieved and not one step was made in the 
peace talks. Then came the present Israeli government under 
Yitzhaq Rabin with the slogan of peace that it raised. We said: 
This augurs well. The truth is that the atmosphere of the 
talks improved with its advent, but the talks themselves did not 
improve or progress. The Israeli side continued to evade 
discussing any topic dealing with substance. They started to 
get closer to essential issues. However, no progress was 
achieved. They said they would submit new ideas. But, 
actually, they were new demands submitted to the Arab side. So 
long as the matter did not deal with substance, we used to give 
and take and to make initiatives. But on substance, there is no 
possibility for compromise or placation. Substance remains 
substance. Syria has offered a great deal since the beginning 
of the peace process. On the opposite side, the Israeli 
government has not offered anything to push the peace process 
ahead. Syria used to take initiatives, make proposals, and 
submit steps the Israelis themselves said were positive. 
Sometimes they even described them as important, but they 
always used to say that more is needed. After the talks 
started, Syria submitted the first written paper. It was a 
document the Americans described as a historic document. The 
Israeli side described it as very important. However, in the 
next session with the Syrian delegation, they said: This is good 
but not sufficient. After some time we offered peace in 
exchange for land. They said: This is good, but not good 
enough. 
  Our foreign minister then proposed complete peace for 
complete withdrawal. They said: This too is good, but unclear. 
They continued to submit other things that have nothing to do 
with the peace process. Thus, matters used to go backward. 
  Israel's stands in all the discussions on the peace process 
are stands that say: Give and keep giving. Recently, the 
European Union chairman visited us. I told him that Israel 
tries to carry out blackmail. It gives nothing, and wants to 
discuss security and all issues in which it alone is interested, 
saying the others have to wait. These are impossible demands. 
The Israelis have submitted matters that are very far from the 
peace process. That's why no progress was achieved. I believe 
that several Western countries consider Israel an element 
hampering the peace process. As for our stand, it has become 
clear to the Americans, the Russians, and all the people that we 
want a complete and comprehensive peace. If peace is not 
comprehensive, one cannot describe it as peace. We, the Arabs 
are one nation even if there is enmity between us. 
  The Americans are now really talking about a comprehensive 
peace and they have convictions about this. Our relations with 
the United States now are much better than before. Had the 
issue merely been Syrian-American relations, there would have 
not been any problems. We have great doubts that Israeli 
officials do not seek peace. We have doubts, but we have not 
reached any final conviction. Such a matter will be either 
proven or disproven by time. 
  We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know 
this. 
We really want peace, while they only speak about peace. In 
light of what they are proposing, it seems that their vision of 
peace is not the same as ours. Therefore, we will struggle 
until their peace becomes identical with our peace. Our position 
is very strong because we are the owners of rights. 
International changes will not force us to retreat. Peace 
means rights. In other words, each party has its rights and 
each party is the master of itself and its interests. This is 
our understanding of peace. When we said the peace of the 
brave, we meant that each party will achieve full peace with all 
its rights, and that each party will not humiliate the other. 
  Addressing the delegation, the president said: I warmly 
thank you for your visit to offer condolences on the death of my 
son. As I said a few days ago, my son is like the rest of the 
citizens. He might have had skills that do not exist in one of 
his colleagues, as happens in every place and in every family. 
Except for the human feelings placed by God in people, all my 
sons in Syria are equal to me. When my sons were still children 
living with me at home, I always pushed them to the front to be 
ready, like all Syrians, to defend the homeland, the Arabs' 
rights, and the interests of the Arab nation. The loss of any 
skilled person whether here, in the Gulf, or in the Maghreb is a 
loss for everyone and for the homeland. I, as well as the 
citizens, viewed the tragedy from this angle. If you saw the 
Syrian citizens during the past days you saw the emotional 
participation of our people. I know our people and their stands 
in all events and circumstances -- it is the same stand in the 
face of all kinds of difficulties, all kinds of aggression, and 
all that take place in accordance God's will. If the deceased 
can know what happens after his death -- and this means knowing 
unseen things -- our son will be happy for meeting his brothers 
who came from Palestine [which was occupied in] 1948. 
  [Text] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah spoke for the delegation, 
saying: We are pleased to hear this pan-Arab position you have 
just expressed. We have always been eager to meet with your 
excellency to hear these positions, which we have followed 
closely. We strongly support this position because it expresses 
the Arab nation's dignity, the Arab conscience, and the cause of 
freedom which cannot be divided anywhere. 
  On this occasion, please allow me to deliver a brief speech 
in the name of the delegation's members to offer our warm 
condolences to our brother His Excellency Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad, to his honorable family, to the Syrian Government, and 
to the fraternal Syrian people on the death of Staff Major 
Basil, whose death is a loss for the whole Arab nation. O Your 
Excellency the President: We share with you this disaster with 
our feelings, minds, and hearts because we are the sons of this 
nation and we are an indivisible part of the Palestinian people 
and the Arab nation. 
  We came to express our sincere feelings and to offer 
condolences to your excellency. At the same time, we are pound 
of Syria's positions under your wise, rational, and brave 
leadership. We also appreciate these positions and realize that 
this sound, nationalist, and sincere pan-Arab position that you 
adopt may be the key to a just and comprehensive solution to the 
dispute in the region -- a solution you have called the peace of 
the brave. We also adopt the formula you have been proposing -- 
the peace of the courageous that which will guarantee rights to 
every nation. Otherwise, peace cannot be achieved. 
  We know that there is an essential contradiction between the 
occupation and the cause of peace. Therefore, we urge the 
Israeli Government persistently and strongly through the Knesset 
and the political map inside Israel to carry out a full 
withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories; namely, the West 
Bank, the Gaza Strip, the occupied Syrian Golan, southern 
Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories, and to 
recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination 
and the establishment of their independent state. 
  We say this knowing that there is an Arab will that Your 
Excellency expressed during your meeting with President Clinton 
in Geneva. There, you represented the Arab nation. Our hearts 
were with you, and when you met with President Clinton, you, O 
Your Excellency the President, were representing the whole Arab 
nation and not just Syria's position. 
  We value the position of militant Syria, the bastion of 
Arabism, which is striving to achieve the unity of this nation. 
We are for inter-Arab coordination. We would like to say, with 
all honesty, that inter-Arab coordination can help our Arab 
nation restore its rights and ensure a just and comprehensive 
solution, because a fragmented Arab position cannot help us 
achieve the accomplishments we seek. It is possible to achieve 
peace when Israel faces a well-coordinated and harmonious Arab 
stand. We are well aware that there are conflicting forces 
operating within the Israeli political spectrum. There are 
pro-peace forces that have recently staged demonstrations to 
protest the heinous Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Tens of thousands 
of people, including us, took part in these demonstrations. 
They demonstrated against the killings, and also to call for 
the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The Israeli Government, however, has thus far failed to 
provide any cogent proof or evidence, in terms of practices, as 
you have just said, to show the entire world community, the Arab 
nation, and us, as citizens, that its position is sound. That 
is why we have demanded that the Israeli Government declare a 
willingness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. 
  With regard to the issue of peace between Syria and Israel, 
the formula raised by President Mubarak and Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar', namely, the formula of full withdrawal in return 
for full peace, we would like to say that we are attempting to 
promote this formula within the Israeli political spectrum so 
that Israeli political forces may support this formula, and so 
that they may express full support for complete withdrawal from 
the Golan in return for a peace agreement. 
  Of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands 
supportive of this formula. The number of people supporting 
this formula is increasing. Likewise, the Israeli Government is 
required to take practical measures toward the sons of our 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories, who are 
suffering from repression, torture, and heinous massacres. 
Thousands of martyrs have fallen, not to mention tens of 
thousands of wounded and detainees. Almost, each and every 
Palestinian house in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has lost a 
martyr, has had a wounded person, or has had a prisoner held in 
Israeli jails. Hence, we call upon Israeli rulers to change 
their policy toward our Palestinian people. 
  Mr. President, I would like to reiterate again that we, the 
Palestinians who have continued to live in Israel proper since 
1948, are committed to our Arab nationalism, to our true 
Arabism, to our Palestinian identity; and that we have neither 
succumbed, nor accepted humiliation. We have not been brought 
to our knees. With regard to Syria's position, which you have 
just explained, we share the same position with you. To us, you 
are a good example. How can the struggle battle be waged, 
except with heads held high with dignity and pride? Hence, I, 
on behalf of our people, who are represented by this delegation, 
salute you. This delegation came to Syria to extend to you our 
fraternal condolences on our people's behalf, and also to clasp 
your hand in your persistent march, and in your constant 
struggle to achieve the Arab nation's objectives. We are well 
aware that Syria, under your leadership, is working to promote 
the Arab nation's interests, to serve the Palestine question, 
and to protect the dignity of this nation, and not only to 
promote the Golan issue, which is confined to Syrian territory. 
Rather, you seek the restoration of all Arab rights. 
  Given all this, we clasp your hands and beseech God Almighty 
to protect you, to grant you continued good health, and to 
render the march you are leading for the sake of Syria, which we 
deem our second home, a success. We take pride in Syria, in its 
president, in its leader, in its symbol, in its people, and in 
its government. Similarly, we hope that the Syrian people, our 
Palestinian people, and our Arab nation will achieve prosperity 
and progress. 
  Concluding my talk, I would like to ask all brothers to read 
the opening chapter of the Koran to invoke God's mercy on the 
souls of the martyrs of the entire Arab nation, the Syrian 
martyrs, the Palestinian martyrs, and the martyrs of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, and also on the soul of the valiant youth Basil 
al-Asad, whose death was a loss to all of us. 
  A delegation member posed the following question to his 
excellency the president: When will the Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations be resumed? And what are Syria's conditions for a 
resumption of the negotiations? Yitzhaq Rabin has repeatedly 
said that he wants a summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad 
to accelerate the peace process? How would you respond to this 
request? 
  His excellency the president answered this question, saying: 
We have an authorized negotiating team that holds negotiations 
with the Israeli delegation. This team is very reliable. When 
they make progress, we will discuss any requirements or 
prerequisites of the peace process. Nonetheless, the 
delegations have continued to mark time. Once they make 
headway, we will discuss any additional requirements, if there 
are any. 
  Another delegation member addressed the following question: 
Mr. Rabin always reacts to your statements. The idea you are 
promoting concerns the attainment of comprehensive and true 
peace in return for an Israeli withdrawal from all Arab 
territories. In reply to this, Rabin says that the extent of 
withdrawal must be commensurate with the scope of peace offered. 
My question is the following: What is the scope of the peace 
you are speaking of? 
  His excellency the president answered this question, saying: 
Why have you not asked him about the extent of withdrawal he is 
speaking of. We have explained the kind of peace we are 
offering; that is, full peace. As for Rabin, he has not 
mentioned full withdrawal. There must be equilibrium. Were I in 
your shoes, I would pose this question to him. He has not 
mentioned full withdrawal. 
  A third delegation member asked the following question: The 
Syrian-Israeli dialogue is a political dialogue. It is moving 
slowly at present. For how long will Syria remain engaged in 
this dialogue if it deems it a waste of time? 
  His excellency the president answered this question, saying: 
Until we reach the conviction that there is no room for a just 
peace.

  [Text] Voting on resolution on human rights violations in 
Kashmir in the UN Human Rights Commission has been postponed by 
three hours on the request of China and Iran. This was stated 
by the foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, during a news 
conference in Islamabad a short while ago. The foreign minister 
said China and Iran have requested Pakistan at the highest level 
not to press for voting on the resolution. He said they are our 
great friends, and we have to give due consideration to their 
proposals. The commission is still in session, and a decision 
to the Chinese and Iranian proposal will be taken after 
consultation. He said the objective of the resolution has been 
achieved to a great extent as Kashmir has become a front-line 
issue, and the world community has stressed on India to improve 
the human rights situation in Kashmir. He said although most of 
the countries have decided to abstain, almost all of them have 
deplored the human rights violations in Kashmir on the floor. 
The foreign minister said this is the first time during last 29 
years that Pakistan has crossed the barriers and has put a 
resolution on Kashmir on the agenda of a world forum. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the information minister, Mr. 
Khalid Ahmad Khan Kharal, said the purpose of this resolution 
was to send fact-finding missions to Kashmir to review the human 
rights conditions. This purpose has been achieved as India has 
opened Kashmir. One mission had already visited, and another 
11-member mission is still in occupied Kashmir. He said 
naturally if this resolution would have been carried, there 
would not have been any change in the ground realities in 
occupied valley. The very fact that fact-finding missions are 
visiting India proves that we have made substantial gains. The 
world community, he added, which had forgotten the plight of 
Kashmiris in the occupied valley is now fully alive of the 
situation and the matter is on their agenda. Almost every world 
capital has sent a strong signal of its displeasure to the 
Indian Government for the human rights violations in occupied 
Kashmir.

against the Iraqi regime's recent maneuvres to get around the UN 
Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 786, to 
benefit from the lifting of the oil embargo imposed against it. 
Ambassador Muhammad 'Abdallah Abu al-Hasan stressed to the 
chairman of the UN Security Council, France's permanent 
representative at the UN, Jean-Bernard Merimee, the need for 
maintaining the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi regime as long as 
that regime, which was still refusing to release Kuwaiti POWs 
and detainees held in its prisons, did not recognize the 
sovereignty and independence of the State of Kuwait. [passage

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Conciliatory Overtures"] </F>
  [Text] After 14 years of mutual animosity between the 
United States and the Islamic Republic, American determination 
to avoid contacts with Iran seems to have diminished. 
  The U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and 
Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau, 
have recently made statements indicative of U.S. intentions to 
open a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic. 
  Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the 
legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding 
international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the 
political realities of the Islamic Republic. 
  Pelletreau recently told the House of Representatives' 
Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs that the United States will not 
try to destabilize the government of Iran and no longer 
considers the Islamic Republic to be a temporary phenomenon. 
Washington's apparent change of heart is motivated by two 
objectives. First, since the demise of the international 
bipolar political power structure, and due to the ambiguous 
nature of the emerging `new world order,' Europe has exercised 
its right to make political decisions independent of the U.S., 
and has therefore gained increasing influence in the Middle 
East. Most European countries, in defiance of the United 
States, have established and maintained cordial relations with 
Iran, thereby limiting American influence in this region. 
  Second, the failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace 
talks has prompted Washington to consider using Tehran's 
spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive and 
legitimize the peace accord, and to indirectly contain what it 
perceives to be the epidemic spreading of 'Islamic 
fundamentalism' in the Muslim Middle East. 
  Realizing and accepting global realities, America is eagerly 
awaiting to reoccupy its dominant position in the Middle East. 
Iran has all along endeavored to stay faithful to its own 
Islamic Revolution while leaving open the possibility of 
reconciliation with the U.S. provided that America releases 
Iran's assets, which are frozen in U.S. banks, and refrains from 
covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and destabilizing 
the Islamic Republic. 
  Considering the resulting benefits for both sides, if 
relations are indeed re-established, the United States stands to 
gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should be prepared to 
make greater concessions. Iranian officials are well aware of 
this fact and will base their demands and proposals accordingly.

  [Text] Amman--Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputies have 
reiterated their demand for the release of unconvicted Islamist 
activists arrested last month in connection with explosions in 
Amman and al-Zarqa'movie theatres. 
  "We demand the release of those who were not convicted," 
before the fall of 'Id al-Fitr at the beginning of next week, 
IAF parliamentary bloc spokesman Hamzah Mansur said Tuesday [8 
March]. 
  Nine people were injured in last month's blasts at the 
Rivoli 
theatre in Amman and Salwa movie theatre in al-Zarqa'. Informed 
sources had earlier linked the arrested suspects to what they 
called "the Afghans," which is a group of Jordanian Islamist 
fundamentalists who took part in the Afghan Mujahidin war 
against the former Soviet Union. IAF Deputy Bassam Omoush told 
the JORDAN TIMES that the IAF lawmakers have sent the government 
a memorandum in which they requested the release of the Islamist 
suspects but have received "no response yet." 
  Mr. Mansur said that "massive arrests" were made in 
connection with the explosions, and those not convicted should 
be released to ensure justice and freedom. He said he "fully" 
supported the punishment of individuals who are proven gilty of 
involvement in "the crime," but added that justice should be 
carried out towards those innocent of the charges brought 
against them. 
  A weekly tabloid Tuesday quoted IAF Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah 
as saying that he had witnessed the arrest of the IAF 
secretariat "despite the fact that the arrest warrant did not 
have the secretariat's name on it." 
  AL-BILAD weekly also quoted Mr. 'Uwaydah as claiming that 
political parties were being "harassed by security forces" and 
that "democracy is being crippled by these random arrests." 
  The tabloid quoted an unnamed senior member of the Muslim 
Brotherhood Movement as saying that Islamists were targets of 
"rumours and traps which are the making of our Jewish enemies, 
their agents and collaborators." 
  According to AL-BILAD, the brotherhood official rejected 
accusations that the government was trying to "harm the 
Islamists reputation." 
  "His Majesty King Husayn spent his life calling for Arab and 
Muslim unity. (The King's) awareness and political wisdom are 
enough reason for us not to believe" that the government is 
spreading rumours against the Islamists, the paper quoted the 
brotherhood leader as saying. 
  IAF deputies are awaiting the return of Prime Minister 'Abd 
al-Salam al-Majali from his trip to Saudi Arabia to perform 
'Umra, to "remind" the government of the issue, said Mr. Mansur.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F>
Darawshah by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] [Humaydi] Do you see any political dimension to 
your visit to Syria? 
  [Darawshah] We have come to offer our condolences and 
perform a social, pan-Arab, and humanitarian duty. We are not 
carrying any messages or carrying out any political mission. 
  [Humaydi] Do you believe that the visit will contribute to 
pushing the peace negotiations forward? 
  [Darawshah] The aim of the visit is not to give an impetus 
to or influence the negotiations. However, if it secures better 
conditions, we welcome that. But I stress that that is not the 
aim. The aim is to perform a duty. 
  [Humaydi] Who are the officials you will meet with during 
the three days you are to spend in Damascus? 
  [Darawshah] We wish to hold political meetings, and, of 
course, we are not going to embark on anything of that kind 
without coordination with the Syrian brothers. 
  [Humaydi] What about the possibility of contacts with those 
opposed to the Oslo accord? 
  [Darawshah] That is up to the brother Syrian hosts. We have 
no reservations about any meeting. 
  [Humaydi] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
between Israel and the PLO? 
  [Darawshah] We advocate ending the occupation, establishing 
an independent Palestinian state, and achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace -- a peace of the brave, as President 
al-Asad called it. I believe that Arab strategy is a peace 
strategy, and Yitzhaq Rabin's government is required to make 
goodwill gestures by announcing its acceptance of the 
land-for-peace principle, agreement to implement resolutions 242 
and 338, and willingness to end the occupation of the occupied 
Arab territories, including the occupied Syrian Golan, so that 
rights will be restored to their legitimate owners. Then there 
would be a real possibility of achieving peace in the region. 
  We are struggling in two directions: the first is to achieve 
peace, end the occupation, and provide every possible support 
for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories so that 
they can obtain their freedom and independence; the second is to 
obtain our rights as citizens, because we are suffering from the 
policy of racial discrimination at all levels. There is 
discrimination against anyone who is not a Jew. 
  [Humaydi] What is your view of a solution to return the 
parties to the negotiating table? 
  [Darawshah] As I said in the Knesset, the Israeli Government 
must make goodwill gestures; restrain the settlers; guarantee 
international protection for the Palestinians, who are subjected 
to repression, torture, and massacre; and declare its 
willingness to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers. 
  [Humaydi] And if that does not happen? 
  [Darawshah] International efforts are under way to find a 
solution to these issues. We are awaiting a resolution from the 
Security Council, and I hope the council's resolution will be in 
line with the Palestinian demands. 
  [Humaydi] You were not offered a ministerial portfolio. 
Will you be offered one when peace is established? 
  [Darawshah] We have demanded our rights and rejected 
injustice and discrimination. Rabin has the desire to deal with 
us. But so far he is still refusing, and we are still insisting 
on our position and demanding our rights. 
  Our rights are numerous, and we have not obtained them. Our 
lands and rights have been confiscated, and these are among the 
things which we will continue to demand. We also demand the 
return of the confiscated land, our national rights, and our 
rights as citizens.

  [Excerpt] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. 
The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri, and Mr. Partovi, Mr. 
Amir-Jahani, Mr. Mohammadi, and Mr. Karimi, deputies from Saqz 
va Baneh, Abhar, Al-Shotor, and Shushtar, gave speeches. Then 
the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he noted the 
martyrdom anniversary of Navab Safavi. We direct the attention 
of our esteemed readers to the detailed Majles proceedings. 
<H5>  Majles Highlights </H5>
<H5>  Majles Speaker </H5>
  The speaker of the Majles glorified and praised the 
struggles 
of those who are devoted to Islam, especially Martyr Navab 
Safavi. 
<H5>  Speeches </H5>
  Partovi, deputy from Saqz va Baneh, discussed the economic 
and welfare problems of the people of Kordestan. He said: Our 
faith and belief is that in the long run our demands will be 
achieved in the shadow of Islam. 
  Mohammadi, deputy from Delfan, said in part of his speech: 
Islamic justice demands that the Plan and Budget Organization 
allocate most of the budget to those provinces where less work 
has been done. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  With the amendment to the Means Law for Combatant University 
Admissions, and if approved in the second consultation, the 
spouses of wounded veterans will make use of these means. 
  Iran has become a member of the Islamic Conference 
Organization Research Center. 
  The scientific, cultural and educational agreement between 
the Islamic Republic of Iran and the governments of Kazakhstan 
and Kirghizestan has been signed. 
<H5>  Majles Speaker's Remarks </H5>
  At yesterday's open Majles session Mr. Nateq-Nuri offered 
congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Seyyed 
ol-Sajedin Emam Zeyn ol-Abedin (peace be upon him). Then in his 
speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Navab Safavi and his 
loyal companions. In this regard he said: Martyr Navab Safavi 
and his companions (Vahedi, Tahmasebi, and other 
comrades-in-arms) once stood in armed struggle against the 
oppressor shah's regime. Few people understood these issues or 
had the courage to take action in an entirely oppressive period 
ruled by suppressors and dictatorship. This cleric and man of 
God had courage and faith in the true meaning of the Islam of 
Mohammad (peace be upon him). He began the movement, and with a 
comprehensive view. 
  The speaker of the Majles then added: When we read the 
history of Navab Safavi, we will understand that he had a 
comprehensive view. For him, it was not simply a matter of 
struggling against a dictatorship. Just as today we and the 
exalted leader are concerned about the cultural invasion, in 
those days the late Martyr Safavi was aware of all the enemy 
fronts. Ultimately, he was abundantly concerned with moving 
towards the nation's independence and the nation's territorial, 
political, and economic independence and self-sufficiency. These 
are the underlying messages in the slogans, speeches, and cries 
of the late Navab and his companions. The Feda'ian of Islam 
began the armed struggle against despotism, imperialism, and 
ideological deviation before any other group, and dealt with 
figures who deviated ideologically or who dared to challenge the 
sacred position of the chaste Imams (peace be upon them). Today 
when Salman Rushdie has insulted the name of the sacred Prophet 
of God (peace be upon him), we are dealing with him. Those days 
that same man of God dealt with those who insulted the sacred 
name of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him) and made them understand. 
He defended the sacred name of the Imams (peace be upon them) 
and he manfully stood his ground and never gave up his beliefs. 
<H5>  Mohammad 'Ali Partovi, Deputy From Saqz va Baneh </H5>
  The economic problems in Kordestan can be solved with 
industrial development and production. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Partovi, deputy from Saqz. During his speech he 
said: One of the most important factors in the development and 
reconstruction of our Islamic land is public participation. 
Among the most important activities, which bring about public 
participation in each region, is cultural work, respect for 
nationalities and sects, and belief in the people. Observing 
these matters based on beliefs, Islamic and real outlooks 
requires comprehensive research and study. 
  Continuing, he said: The views and commands of His Holiness 
the Imam (peace be upon him) with regard to the religiously 
legitimate rights of the Kurdish people and the principles of 
the Constitution in connection with the province of Kordestan 
must be implemented in the region to keep the enemies of Islam 
from misusing the situation and the realities of the regions, 
because without implementing those things, every measure will be 
temporary and without roots. If the problems in Kordestan are 
not solved at the roots, if they are not systematically treated 
and if emigrant forces do not have sufficient understanding of 
the culture, way of life and economy of the people, every day 
problems and processes will be created that will torment the 
people. When every aspect of the lives of our people is in 
commerce and border exchanges, naturally the forces combatting 
it with violence will cause social disorders and severe 
disruptions. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: In the old days, in the 
historical fabric of our border-keeping people, border trade was 
the main way of making a living. Kordestan is deprived of a 
factory and a simple production center. Agriculture is done in 
primitive and traditional ways. Animal husbandry is not 
economical. Therefore the border location and the indifference 
of the idolaters have positioned the economic pulse in border 
trade. 
  In this regard blood has been shed and lives have been lost 
in the course of making a living, leading to mothers and fathers 
in black, social disruption, and recently this issue has also 
caused the killing of several people, including a girl in the 
city of Baneh, and the wounding of a number of people, including 
a worker who was kicked to death in public after being hit by 
several bullets. 
  Partovi said: It is never justifiable for a nation, which 
has 
always guarded the borders with nobility, bravery, and glory and 
is the oldest and most genuine Iranian race, to see the blood of 
its innocent dear ones spilled on the soil of their country for 
trying to make a living and fill their stomachs. 
  We have repeatedly issued memos that the economic problems 
in 
Kordestan can be solved with industrial development and 
production. Of course, in answer they say that investment is not 
done properly at the borders, or that they should do border 
trade in a lawful, correct and supervised manner so that the 
blood of the innocent will not be repaid by the hunger of the 
deprived. 
  We believe and our people believe that in the long run our 
demands and the true face of our aspirations will be realized in 
the shadow of Islam. We are hoping for a better day and for the 
progress of Islam and the revolution even as we mourn the blood 
of our innocent daughter. 
  He then added: The point is not concealed from observers 
that 
the revolution's true heirs are mostly the oppressed and the 
destitute of society. Therefore, in return for their effort and 
sacrifice, it is incumbent upon all government leaders to 
coordinate all policies and political and executive positions to 
support them. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Saqz discussed the question of 
the origins of the deprivation in Kordestan. he said: 
  For us, the border location, the difficulty of travel 
because 
of the geography or the oppressiveness of the idolater regime 
are no justification for the respected minister of petroleum to 
say that because Saqz, Baneh and Marivan are on difficult 
terrain for travel, providing gas delivery to these three cities 
is not possible except in the Third Five-Year Plan, because the 
real concept of eliminating deprivation is observing the factors 
of deprivation. 
  Even the idolaters could have used difficulty of passage as 
a 
pretext for making apologies and sad excuses. I therefore direct 
the attention to the minister of petroleum to the fact that at 
the meeting at the Ministry of Petroleum attended by the 
governor-general, the respected minister emphasized that before 
the Second Five-Year Plan he would extend gas delivery activity 
from Qarveh to Bijar, Divan-e Darreh, Saqz and Baneh. We gave 
hope to the deprived Muslim people of the area based on his 
excellency's promise, and the identity of the revolution is 
based on promises. If difficulty of passage is not an excuse, 
Mian-e Do Ab and Bukan will be in the Five-Year Plan. The 25 
kilometers between Bukan and Saqz are also planned, and the 
route is level. In fairness, these people are truly more 
deserving than others. 
  In conclusion, he directed the attention of the respected 
officials to the following matters: Making maximum use of 
committed and experienced forces in various posts to bring about 
maximum participation, refraining from hiring the well-off and 
prosperous, making use of the views and proposals and studying 
the criticisms of experts in Kordestan to improve the existing 
situation, giving serious attention to the low-income classes in 
planning and performance, basic planning for using Kordestan's 
natural and mining resources in this virgin area, investing in 
Kordestan's ancient sites to attract tourism and its foreign 
exchange revenue, creating a Sunni seminary in Kordestan and 
equipping it with the needed resources, and creating conditions 
for it to attract clerics for the growth and deepening of the 
rich culture of Islam. 
<H5>  Seyyed Fazel Amir-Jahani, Deputy From Abhar </H5>
  The failure to control the prices of items and materials on 
the market brings direct and indirect economic pressure on 
society's vulnerable classes, especially the workers. 
  The next speaker was Amir-Jahani, deputy from Abhar. During 
his speech he offered congratulations on the arrival of the 
blessed days of the month of Sha'ban. He said: Taking 
inspiration from the immortal slogan "hardship is regrettable" 
[unattributed Arabic quote], representing the Hezbollah nation 
we express our anger, hatred, and loathing for the crimes of 
filthy America and its agents throughout the world, especially 
those against the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Palestine, Kashmir, and other places. We condemn those who use 
their evil pens to write of relations with America, and we warn 
them of the anger of the combative nation. 
  He discussed the 15th anniversary of the triumph of the 
Islamic revolution and discussed the end of the First Five-Year 
Plan. He said: The experience gained in the First Five-Year Plan 
included a series of strengths in the plan, such as the start-up 
and the construction of basic and infrastructure projects in 
various sectors, which we have seen and are seeing. Along with 
that, however, the plan's consequences also include weak points. 
These include relatively severe fluctuations in the price of 
foreign exchange on the market, which created conditions for 
abuses by professional brokers. The failure to control the 
prices of items and materials on the market brings direct and 
indirect economic pressure on society's vulnerable classes, 
especially the workers with high school diplomas and less, lack 
of attention and failure to pay the necessary subsidies to 
farmers, the increase in the number of unemployed people, and 
especially the small percentage of employed people in rural 
society, which lacks agricultural land, livestock and stable 
employment. 
  The deputy from Abhar thanked the government and noted: 
After 
the approval of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget 
Bill will be the best and most appropriate opportunity for the 
Majles to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the First 
Five-Year Plan based on the realities, for expert work to be 
done in approving the Second Five-Year Plan, for greater care to 
be exercised, and for minimizing the weaknesses of the past. Of 
course, in this regard the announced views of the exalted leader 
addressed to the president of the republic as the policies to 
prevail over the Second Five-Year Plan have completely clarified 
the directions the plan will take. Some of its paragraphs 
mention serious and lawful government and judicial support for 
the oppressed class, creating employment, expanding and 
improving the social security system, reviving the tradition of 
interest-free loans in the nation's banking system, avoiding 
foreign borrowing, and making efforts for a gradual liberation 
from current commitments. 
  He added: It is hoped that the deputies will give the 
appropriate attention to achieving the goals of self-sufficiency 
in agricultural products in order to properly develop such 
matters as providing security to rural farmers, planning and 
implementing education and promoting proven and successful 
methods, encouraging farmers to form cooperative units for 
agricultural products and solve the problems of insurance and 
social security for the owners of production, insuring 
agricultural products and guaranteed purchases for agricultural 
products based on a price-setting mechanism that is appropriate 
for expenses, making arrangements and finding easy ways to 
export their crops, and taking measures to establish conversion 
industries. 
  Amir-Jahani then issued a memo to the Ministry of Power 
concerning the implementation of the Law Prohibiting the Use of 
Underground Water, and he thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for 
its promise to help provide gas delivery to the area. 
<H5>  Mohammad Mohammadi, Deputy From Delfan and Al-Shotor </H5>
  Islamic justice requires that most of the budget be 
allocated 
to the provinces where less work has been done. 
  The third pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Mohammadi, deputy from al-Shotor. He offered 
congratulations on the birth anniversary of His Holiness Imam 
Hoseyn (peace be upon him), His Holiness Imam Sajjad (peace be 
upon him) and His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon 
him), standard-bearer of Karbala. He offered congratulations to 
the government of Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani for having achieved 
striking successes in the First Five-Year Plan with its 
infrastructure work in the enormous economy. He said: It is 
natural that there will be intermittent inflation during the 
transition from a subsidized economy to a sound and fundamental 
economy, especially after the consequences of the imposed war. 
However, it is requested that the beloved president of the 
republic make great effort and exercise the necessary 
supervision over prices to stop excessive price increases, the 
primary burden of which falls on the shoulders of the deprived. 
  Continuing, he said: Islamic justice requires that the Plan 
and Budget Organization allocate most of the budget to the 
provinces where less work has been done. If projects are to be 
suspended, this should be done in the prosperous provinces, 
rather than by eliminating a teacher training center in the 
deprived region of al-Shotor and several other places in the 
province of Lorestan. 
  He thanked the minister of the interior for appointing Mr. 
Mohammadizadeh governor-general of Lorestan and expressed the 
hope that the new governor-general would exercise full 
supervision and employ native and Hezbollah forces, who are 
always with the clergy, in order to be able to serve this 
deprived province. The speaker thanked and praised the minister 
of labor for traveling to the province of Lorestan to open and 
do the ground-breaking on factories for employment and technical 
and professional training, which hopefully will alleviate 
unemployment in our country. 
  The deputy from al-Shotor then thanked brother Engineer 
Basharati, chief of the Deprived Areas Office, for his serious 
concern for the deprived areas. 
  He said: Engineer Basharati, with his God-given memory, is 
entirely familiar with every part of the deprived areas and is 
trying to alleviate deprivation. It is requested of the 
respected Majles Plan and Budget Commission and respected 
colleagues that special attention be given to this office, as 
well as the Ministry of Labor, for in this way deprivation will 
be alleviated in the country. 
  In conclusion he asked the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry 
of Agriculture, and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade 
to give more attention to this deprived and ever-present 
on-the-scene province. 
<H5>  Zabihollah Karimi, Deputy From Shushtar </H5>
  Karimi, deputy from Shushtar, was the final pre-agenda 
speaker. In his speech he offered congratulations on the birth 
of Imam Sajjad (peace be upon him) and said: 27 Dey [17 January] 
is the anniversary of the bloody martyrdom and the red flight of 
the passionate martyr 'Erfan Mohammadi, the great martyr Navab 
Safavi and his loyal companions. This is a good opportunity to 
show respect for the good spirits of the great martyrs of Islam 
and sacrificing martyrs of Islam. [passages omitted on Navab 
Safavi's life] 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H3>  Amendment to the Law Creating Means for Combatant University 
Admissions </H3>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the first consultation of the 
Culture and Higher Education Commission on the Proposed 
Amendment to Note 3 of the Law Amending the Law Creating Means 
for Combatant, Crusader, and Basiji Volunteer Admissions to 
Universities and Institutions of Higher Education, the general 
form of which was approved by the deputies. 
  In discussing this motion, the expert from the Higher 
Education Commission Said: Based on Note 3, "the children of 
martyrs, invalids and former prisoners and their spouses and the 
children of injured veterans with more than 50 percent 
disabilities may benefit from the provisions of this law by 
notifying the Martyr Foundation of the Islamic Revolution, the 
Former Prisoners Staff and the Foundation for the Oppressed and 
War Veterans." In this motion it was proposed that the spouses 
of injured veterans be added to this note. 
<H5>  Bill To Form Supreme National Technical Council </H5>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Plan and Budget Commission concerning the 
Bill To Form the Supreme National Technical Council, the general 
form of which was not approved and was rejected. 
  In explaining this bill, the expert from the Plan and Budget 
Commission said: 
  In the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 March 1978] there was a 
note in the budget law for that year, which is one of the 
permanent notes. In this note the government is authorized to 
change and revise base prices, based on prices, regulations and 
guidelines approved by the shah's Commission. With the triumph 
of the Islamic revolution the Revolutionary Council amended 
Article 1. Article 1 authorized technical councils to be formed 
in the provinces and it specified the composition of these 
councils in the provinces. Among the prerogatives of the 
councils, they authorized the supreme technical council to 
adjust the base price of the ceiling figure, which is increased 
by the amount of each development project. That which the 
government has now presented is an amendment to the 
Revolutionary Council's Paragraph J, but the Plan and Budget 
Commission decided that while we are preparing the government's 
amendment, we should approve the Bill To Form the Supreme 
National Technical Council, to make this council permanent. This 
bill sets general limits on prerogatives and duties. 
<H5>  Rural Development Inquiry Motion </H5>
  The third item on the agenda was the report from the Plan 
and 
Budget Commission concerning the motion to conduct an inquiry on 
the rural development mentioned in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] National Budget Law, and the 
inquiry was approved. 
<H5>  Topic of Inquiry </H5>
  Is what is intended by the term "rural development credits" 
(in Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 
1994] National Budget Law) all the development measures done by 
the reconstruction crusade in the rural areas, or not? 
<H5>  Commission's View </H5>
  Article 1: What is meant by "credits" (rural development in 
Paragraph 2, Note 55 of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 
National Budget Law) and other credits are those activities that 
are provided in the law under the heading of rural development. 
<H5>  Request To Reject 3 Bills </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was the request to reject three 
government bills: 
  1. The Bill To Append a Note to Article 7 of the Iran and 
World Tourism Industrial Development Law, enacted in 1370 [21 
March 1991-20 March 1992] by the Council of Ministers, based on 
the note to Article 89 of the Majles Domestic Guidelines. 
  2. Bill on the Cultural, Scientific, and Educational 
Agreement between the Governments of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan. 
  3. Bill to collect the price of road maintenance services. 
<H3>  Bill on Iran's Membership in the Islamic Conference 
Organization Research Center </H3>
  The fifth item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the first consultation of the 
Islamic Guidance and Art Commission concerning the Bill on the 
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Membership in the 
Center for Islamic Historical, Artistic, and Cultural Research 
Affiliated with the Islamic Conference Organization, the general 
form of which was approved. 
<H3>  Scientific, Cultural, and Educational Agreement Between the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the Governments of Kazakhstan and 
Kyrgyzstan </H3>
  The final item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art 
Commission concerning the Bill on the Scientific, Cultural, and 
Educational Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the Governments of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and this agreement 
was also approved by the deputies. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
  The minister of energy said in an interview with RESALAT's 
parliamentary correspondent: 
  The electrical power distribution companies were 
nongovernment at first. Now 26 electrical power distribution 
companies have been formed throughout the country and are 
managed by the private sector. After privatization the 
efficiency of these companies increased. 
  Continuing, he discussed economizing on electrical power 
consumption. He said: The Ministry of Commerce must be given the 
authority to control the labor hours of guilds in view of the 
nature of the work, as is done in other countries, because it is 
not necessary for some guilds to remain at the work site until 
late at night. 
  The minister of energy said: In studying rate increases, the 
Majles should make policy in such a way that those who consume 
less will have more subsidies and exemptions. 
  In conclusion, he said: The government pays a total of about 
540 billion tomans per year in subsidies.

The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Hojjat 
ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the 
cities of Amol, Golpaygan, Khomeyn and Bu'inzahra, and Avej gave 
speeches. Then the Majles took up its agenda. We direct the 
attention of our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Majles Highlights </H5>
<H5>  Speeches </H5>
  Mr. Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, criticized the excessive 
imports of automobiles into the country. Elsewhere in his talk 
he criticized Note 10 in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget concerning the sale of hospitals and making them 
autonomous. He called it a disaster. 
  Mr. Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan, mentioned creating 
conditions favorable to exports, reducing food crop imports, 
reinforcing and developing conversion industries, population 
control and insuring vulnerable crops as ways to make the 
economy grow and prosper. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  The Majles approved the scientific, educational, and 
cultural 
agreement between Iran and Turkmenistan. 
  The 38-article charter for the Social Security Treatment 
Services Organization, which the government presented to the 
Majles in a bill, was approved. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mahmud Kazemi-Dinan, Deputy From Amol </H5>
  All those involved in the economic war must strive to 
produce 
more. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker was Kazemi-Dinan, deputy from 
Amol. He thanked the people of the province of Mazandaran for 
welcoming the president of the republic. He said: This trip 
brought with it the good news of the prosperity of Mazandaran. 
This will be continued by the new province management, thanks to 
the divine blessing of his excellency's (the governor-general's) 
continued efforts, and it is well-known and obvious that his 
beautiful leadership and planning has received a lovely and 
pleasing welcome from the dear nation. God willing, the 
God-given talents of Mazandaran will emerge in a timely and 
appropriate way with the help of the sacred government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. [passages omitted on anti-American, 
other statements] 
  We have already put behind us its fourth year with 
steadfastness, through the efforts of the nameless powerful 
economic officers. Through critical management and the efforts 
victorious leaders and commanders in the unequal war, we have 
overcome the enemy's vengeful objectives and the grudges and 
pessimism of friends on the deadly battlefield of the 
complicated economic crusade. We continue ceaselessly on our 
path carrying out the great economic adjustment and we occupy 
ourselves writing the Five-Year Plan and budget before the 
astonished eyes of world imperialism's economic monster and 
despite its heavy blows, such as the drop in the price of oil. 
  The deputy from Amol then said: Thanks are due to the 
planners, well-wishers, soldiers, and executive managers who 
were shot at from both sides by bombs and bullets. Have no fear 
of traveling under the leadership of the decisive commander in 
the former sacred defense. Under the heroic Hashemi's leadership 
the courageous army of love will be given matchless courage by 
the creator. As the famous proverb says, if 'Ali is the camel 
driver, he knows where to make the camel sleep and he does not 
fear. 
  Kazemi-Dinan then emphasized: All those involved in the 
economic war must strive to produce more, in accordance with 
prior guidance whose expected conditions have arrived. If we 
exercise piety by consuming less for love of the beloved, we 
will defeat our rival. This is the second phase of the test, 
which God willing we will pass proudly, as we did the first 
historic test. 
  He discussed the other imperialist plot, intended to 
dominate 
the Muslim women of our country. He said: We will make every 
effort to reach the goal of making serious effort to educate our 
sisters. However, economic planners and managers must be told, 
based on the fundamental guidance of His Holiness the Imam, to 
give priority to agriculture and we must put industry in the 
service of agriculture, because the existence of the noble 
nation depends on agricultural production. 
  Our nation has high potential, and the governments, which 
have attained power, have traveled this path. This is in 
conflict with the goals of world imperialism. The dear farmers 
must understand that they are the soldiers with low expectations 
on this path and they strive continuously, having girded 
themselves under the pressure of arms and and unnecessary 
delays. It is no longer appropriate for organizations to sell at 
higher prices and for products to be more expensive while you 
reinforce them. In the Five-Year Plan you must support their 
fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, raw materials, electrical 
power, and water. 
<H5>  Morteza Shayesteh, Deputy From Khansar and Golpayegan </H5>
  The ways to economic prosperity include population control, 
reduced imports, strengthening conversion industries, and 
insuring vulnerable crops. 
  The next speaker was Shayesteh, deputy from Golpaygan and 
Khansar. He offered congratulations and felicitations on the 
birth anniversary of the prince of martyrs (peace be upon him), 
His Holiness Abol-Fazl al-'Abbas (peace be upon him) and His 
Holiness Seyyed al-Sajedin Zeyn al-'Abedin (peace be upon him) 
to the Shi'ites of the world and our esteemed compatriots. He 
said: In view of the fact that the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget bill is under study and the Second Five-Year Social 
and Cultural Development Plan will also be studied in the near 
future, I consider it necessary to give my expert views on the 
gross national product. 
  He added: In the year 1335 [21 March 1955-20 March 1956] 
food 
for 1.6 persons was produced on a hectare of agricultural land. 
In the year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] this figure 
reached 3.2 persons. To feed the people in our society, we must 
bring this figure up to 4.5 persons. Various statistics indicate 
that 25 to 30 percent of various foodstuffs are lost because of 
poor conversion and storage resources, meaning that enough food 
to feed 15 to 20 million people is destroyed through losses. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: For many reasons, such as the 
fact that it uses little foreign exchange and earns much foreign 
exchange, creates employment, has potential resources and 
employs existing technology in the country, the agricultural 
sector needs to continue its rapid development. Based on 
existing data this sector's share in the gross domestic product 
[GDP] in the year 1339 [21 March 1960-20 March 1961] compared to 
the other sectors was 37.5 percent. In the year 1351 [21 March 
1972-20 March 1973] it was 16.2 percent. In the year 1356 [21 
March 1977-20 March 1978] it was less than 10 percent of the 
GDP. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] it began 
rising and reached 23.7 percent, and in the year 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993] it reached 26.6 percent. 
  One path to development in the economic sector is to 
increase 
investment in this sector. According to existing statistics, the 
agriculture sector's share in forming fixed gross domestic 
investment is insignificant. In the year 1352 [21 March 1973-20 
March 1974] it was 19.7 percent. In the year 1363 [21 March 
1984-20 March 1985] it was about 4.2 percent and in the year 
1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] it was about 7.5 percent. 
Although relative attention was given to this sector after the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution, the sector's share of total 
development credits was insignificant. 
  From 1352 to 1356 [21 March 1973-20 March 1978] this share 
was about 7.5 percent. From 1368 to 1372 [21 March 1989-20 March 
1994] it was about 9.6 percent, so that about 1.33 rials[R] was 
invested for each hectare of agricultural land, or about 0.1 
percent, an insignificant figure compared to the developed 
nations. According to existing statistics, in the years 1344 to 
1362 [21 March 1965-20 March 1984], the production investment 
indicator in the agricultural sector was 2.36 percent, and it 
was 4.23 in other sectors. Again based on existing statistics, 
about one in three of the workers in our country works in 
agriculture. 
  It is also worth mentioning: In terms of quantities, the 
employment structure in the economic development cycle has 
continually shown a decline in the agricultural sector along 
with increases in the industrial and service sectors. On the one 
hand our current society is faced with the phenomenon of 
unemployment and it is expected that by the year 1385 [21 March 
2006-20 March 2007] our country will need 16.56 million 
employment opportunities. To create a job in the service sector 
requires investment of R2.11 million, and it costs R1.37 million 
in the agricultural sector. Apart from the fact that investment 
for agricultural employment is less than in the other sectors, 
it also has significant profits and is relatively advantageous. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: Exports of agricultural and 
traditional goods have always made up the biggest part of nonoil 
exports, and in the years 1361 to 1370 [21 March 1982-20 March 
1992] they grew an average of 24.3 percent. In the year 1361 
agricultural goods valued at more than $255 million made up 60 
percent of nonoil exports, while industrial export goods were 
valued at $21 million and made up about 7.5 percent of nonoil 
exports. In the year 1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987] 
agricultural exports increased 110 percent over the previous 
year. That same year industrial goods made up 12 percent of 
nonoil exports. 
  He then said: These figures show agriculture's place in our 
nation's economy. I declare that if full attention is given to 
this sector, in the near future we will be able to forget about 
the policy of the one-product economy. 
  At the end of his speech he made the following 
recommendations to achieve economic growth and prosperity: 
Population control, reducing losses by training producers, 
distributors and consumers, reinforcing and developing 
conversion industries, building silos, warehouses and 
refrigerators, writing laws and regulations in the interest of 
the economic sectors, especially agriculture, creating 
conditions favorable for exports, reducing food imports, 
creating cooperation and better contacts between the service 
sectors and the economic producing sector in such a way that the 
focus will be on production, insuring vulnerable crops, 
reinforcing and developing production cooperatives and 
organizing the sales market. 
<H5>  Mohammad Baqer Tavakoli, Deputy From Khomeyn </H5>
  The sale of hospitals and government units and making them 
autonomous in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill 
is a disaster. 
  Tavakoli, deputy from Khomeyn, was the third pre-agenda 
speaker. He offered congratulations on Combatants and Guards 
Day. Concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
bill, he said: As long as the government and the Majles are 
unable to reform the administrative and management structure and 
reduce the enormous costs in the ministries and government 
companies and reduce the costs of production, and as long as 
they cannot limit the enormous competition for consumerism, 
ostentation, trips abroad and seminars, by raising prices and 
eliminating some subsidies, we will not succeed in reducing 
costs. 
  He added: Although the Majles has prohibited the purchase of 
passenger automobiles and the formation of companies in the 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget to reduce costs, 
unfortunately late in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 
1993] a huge amount of passenger automobiles was purchased and 
numerous companies were formed. 
  Although Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget bill was implemented on a revenue cost basis, it will 
include about R3 trillion in revenues for government, oil, 
power, and communications companies. If we consider the nation's 
population in the year 1373 to be 60 million, the average worker 
wage at 28,000 tomans and the average family to be five people, 
as of the year 1373 every Iranian will have an average income 
deficit of 5,000 tomans and every family will have an income 
deficit of 25,000 tomans. 
  He added: Workers, who are the nation's real vulnerable 
class, will have 11 months purchasing power in 1373 compared to 
the year 1372. The implementation of Note 25 optimistically 
projects inflation at about 10 to 15 percent. Calculating the 
inflation in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill 
at about 13 to 25 percent, less an increase of 5 percent in 
worker wages for that year, this great class in the nation will 
be faced with inflation of about 20 to 35 percent. 
  According to statistics, the government consumes about 7 
million of the 48 million liters of gasoline consumed daily, and 
in the transportation and shipping sector the government is 
considered one of the major consumers. With the increase in the 
price of fuel and transportation costs, heavy costs will be 
imposed on the government. Ultimately the inflationary burden 
will fall on the people and the vulnerable class. 
  He then recommended the deletion of Note 25 and discussed 
the 
matter of drugs in the country. He said: Drugs are an important 
and vital public need. In view of the fact that in the year 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994], because of limited foreign 
exchange about 20 percent of the nation's drugs were sold at the 
floating foreign exchange rate, regrettably I must say that 
treatment services and social security for this same vulnerable 
and wage-earning class were eliminated from insurance polices. 
Next year a percentage will be added to that. I therefore ask my 
colleagues to give special attention to this vital matter. 
  The implementation of paragraphs Z and M of Note 10 
concerning the sale of hospitals and treatment units and making 
them autonomous is a disaster, because this will only be 
practical in the major cities and Tehran and will have bad 
effects on the country. 
  Continuing, Tavakoli discussed the government's failure to 
observe social justice in Paragraph T, Note 5 of the 1372 [21 
March 1993-20 March 1994] budget. He said: Again we saw and are 
seeing comfortable families receiving huge subsidies. For 
example, among electrical power subscribers, today rural and 
low-consumption subscribers receive monthly subsidies of 1,000 
tomans. Normal consumption subscribers receive average monthly 
subsidies of 3,400 tomans, and comfortable and high-consumption 
subscribers in society receive monthly subsidies of 10,000 
tomans. That is, the comfortable subscribers receive ten times 
the subsidies of the rural and low-income subscribers. 
  He added: Unfortunately, credits to build rural public bath 
houses and to improve the rural areas in Central Province have 
been deleted from the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, 
and I ask officials to correct this error. 
  Continuing his remarks, Tavakoli asked the minister of roads 
and transportation for help and cooperation in concluding the 
Khomeyn-Dehno project, and he asked the minister of health care, 
treatment and medical education for help and cooperation in 
elevating the expert nursing program in Khomeyn to the level of 
a nursing college. 
<H5>  Majid Naderi, Deputy From Bu'in, Zahra, and Avej </H5>
  The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Naderi, deputy from Bu'in, Zahra and Avej. During 
his speech he said: Now 38 years have passed since the martyrdom 
of the great men whose battles and sacrifice began at a time 
when the dead earth was heaped over this nation, and our Islamic 
land was subjected to cultural, political economic and military 
assaults. In those days the enemies of Iran and Islam occupied 
the country and imposed humiliating treaties. This was done 
during Reza Khan's 20-year era. 
  Making use of the so-called open political atmosphere and 
starting groups and political parties dependent on foreign 
policies, they took over the newspapers and mercenary 
publications and tried to destroy the freedom of the Iranian 
nation. It was religious zeal and enthusiasm that led to a 
reaction against the occupiers. He continued: After the month of 
Shahrivar in the year 1320 [23 August-22 September 1941] the 
appearance of publications such as the magazine 
Parcham, the newspaper MARDOM, the emergence of 
secular, materialist and nationalist writers and the printing of 
misleading books and their extensive distribution, were all 
definitely calculated to prevent religious unity among the 
various social classes. [passages omitted on Navab Safavi]

and Turkmenistan </H3>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. The Majles held an open session yesterday with Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri presiding, and Messrs. Hoseyni, Razavi, 
Mokhtari, and Mohammadifar, deputies from the cities of Boyer 
Ahmad, Na'in, Najafabad, and Sanqez and Kolia'i, made pre-agenda 
speeches. Then the Majles went into session. We call to your 
attention the details of the discussion. 
<H5>  Seyyed Mas'ud Hoseyni, Deputy From Kohkiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad </H5>
  The first pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was Hoseyni from Kohkiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad, 
who offered his congratulations on the birthday of his holiness 
Mahdi and said: It is hoped that this raised flag, divine trust, 
and memento of the pious slave of God will be given by the grand 
leader of the revolution, Imam Khamene'i, to his holiness. 
  He continued: Oppressed humanity has found salvation in the 
model of the divine system of the Islamic revolution and no 
longer accepts injustice and misery and is not afraid of the 
threats of the oppressors and the United States. 
  The speaker also added: The claim of a new order is an 
effort 
to create a global regime on the basis of absolute worldliness 
and the manifestations of materialism and based on the 
inclinations of the criminal United States as the sole master 
and also to unite all the followers of falsehood and world 
devourers against the rule of religion, to eliminate 
spirituality, and to disregard human values and virtues, in 
short, the goals of the prophethood of prophets, particularly 
pure Islam. 
  Referring to the changes, the fall of government, and the 
defeat of regimes, he said: The only lasting regime, until trust 
is given to the original owner of this government, is the sacred 
regime of the Islamic Republic. The people of Iran are 
commissioned to perform this divine duty and, as an exemplary 
nation, by obeying the Imam and the guardian; supporting the 
Islamic government; moving along the straight path with hope for 
a bright future; passing through obstacles, shortcomings, and 
deficiencies in the executive system of the society; and 
separating the evil acts of some individuals from beloved Islam, 
by relying on God, will neutralize the conspiracies of the 
villains. 
  In connection with the role and efforts of the government to 
achieve overall independence and self-sufficiency, Hoseyni said: 
(The government) must not be afraid of the propaganda ruckus 
that goes on in the outside world about the economic situation. 
  Pointing out that the nation knows that much of what was 
destroyed has been built and much fundamental work has begun or 
been implemented in the First [Five-Year Economic and 
Development] Plan, he said: No one can expect the revolution to 
own him. Everyone is indebted to the revolution and Islam. What 
claim could those who complain have if they have not been 
involved in the field of battle? And if they have been involved 
and are today creating such a ruckus by misusing freedom and the 
resources of this nation and are trying to make people despair, 
and in making their ideas and statements ring true have 
unpleasant and unreasonable desires, from which cup are they 
drinking and towards which spring are they moving? Of course, no 
one will claim that there are no shortcomings. But if we take 
into consideration the world conditions, the obstacles, the 
problems, the volume of conspiracies, the situation of 
yesterday, and the existing resources, on the whole, we have had 
a growth trend and much great work has been done. The government 
considers it its duty to continue giving priority to the 
interests of Islam and the barefooted and to serve those who are 
the actual owners of the revolution; to avoid love of comfort, 
bureaucracy, waste, and extravagance, which is a great 
pestilence; and to deal with the misusers of the Treasury and 
the embezzlers in the economic system of the country through 
decisive and continuous supervision and prosecution. 
  The deputy from Boyer Ahmad continued: It is not acceptable 
for leniency to be shown towards embezzling gangs, theives, 
those who use connections, and those who cause delays with 
regard to the affairs of the people; or for the flatterers and 
the indifferent to be favored and for some individuals engaged 
in such behavior to violate someone's rights; or without the 
necessary qualifications for a position for someone to acquire 
vast wealth from the Treasury of the country in a short period 
of time; or for those who have given all that they possess 
sincerely and who have been active with their presence, pen, 
words, blood, and reputation since the beginning wherever the 
revolution has needed it to be abandoned in administrative red 
tape with futile excuses. 
  He then referred to the constant conspiracies of the United 
States against the revolution and in another part of his speech 
said: It is the duty of the Majles to devise the policies 
outlined and the directives of the grand leader for the Second 
Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget in every 
section in such a way that they are carefully implemented and 
their proper implementation is supervised. 
  Considering that constant supervision over various areas 
will 
only be considered lack of trust and also a sign of the 
presence, ability, and power of the regime and will strengthen 
the relationship between the nation and the government, it is 
necessary for the government to take every possible effort and 
care to implement supervision. 
  In conclusion, he pointed out the importance of agricultural 
issues in the national policies. 
<H5>  Seyyed Abolfazl Razavi, Deputy From Na'in </H5>
  The next speaker was Razavi from Na'in, who honored the 
birthday of the spreader of justice in the world, his holiness 
Mahdi, and the 10 days of Fajr of the Islamic revolution. 
Speaking on the present situation of the world, he said: New 
polarizations are being formed in the world around joint 
economic interests, and the world apparently is moving toward 
polarization based on economic competition. Under such changing 
conditions in the world, we must realize the sensitivity of the 
time and place and guarantee our effective presence in this 
global struggle. Our country enjoys a special place in the world 
in terms of culture, especially among Muslims in the world, 
because Iran is the basis of the Islamic revolution and the 
motherland of the Islamic world. 
  In continuation, the speaker said about the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1994] bill and the Second Developmental Plan: For 
years, our economy has been dependent on oil revenues and the 
fate of our economy decided by the oil markets. The hope and 
goal of everyone has been to be freed of this dangerous 
dependence. The negative effects of the decrease in the price of 
oil in recent months are known to everyone. But, fortunately, it 
has also had a positive effect. It has made the officials 
determined to be free from dependence on petrodollars. The 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget and the Second 
Developmental Plan are the crystallization of such a 
determination. 
  [1] The reform of the administrative system and increase in 
efficiency of the government to make better use of oil revenues 
and decrease dependency on it is an undeniable necessity to 
which serious attention must be paid in the [Second 
Developmental] Plan and Budget. 
  2) In order to be freed from dependence on oil revenues, we 
must rely on domestic revenues, the most important of which is 
taxes. For whatever reason, our tax system has not been 
efficient enough. The tax system of the country must be reformed 
with attention to three main goals of ensuring social justice, 
gaining the trust of the people, and supporting production. 
Social justice dictates that individuals with higher incomes 
should pay more taxes. To ensure that such is the case, I 
suggest that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance 
establish tax files for all individuals in society. 
  [Text missing] containing a list of the property and 
possessions of every individual, and every year on the basis of 
the increase in the property and possessions of every person 
taxes will be collected from him. Also, for individuals who fail 
to provide a correct list of their property and possessions and 
evade payment of taxes in any manner, severe punishments must be 
imposed, such as deprivation of certain social rights. 
  He also said: To gain the trust of the people, the 
government 
must act in a manner that people realize the taxes paid are 
spent on the development of the country and the welfare of the 
citizens. For instance, the government can allow the taxpayers 
to build schools, libraries, and parks and provide the people 
with the means to participate in the implementation of projects. 
Also, in order to support production, the government must 
provide special tax incentives and, by changing the percentages 
for the collection of taxes, mobilize the resources of the 
country toward production. Obviously, the implementation of such 
a tax system is only possible with the judicial security and 
stability of the economy in the country. 
  3) One of the main goals of the regime is support for the 
oppressed and vulnerable strata of the society vis-a-vis 
economic pressures resulting from the implementation of the 
economic modification policy. Considering that subsidies are 
supposed to be stopped and next year's budget projects increases 
in certain public goods, such as electricity, water, telephone, 
and energy, based on the rationale that the present situation is 
in the interests of the affluent strata, steps must be taken to 
increase the price of these goods, based on careful expert 
studies and the estimate of the probable political tensions 
resulting from them. It is necessary to make preparations in the 
budget to protect the vulnerable strata. 
  4) About 55 percent of the population of the country 
consists 
of individuals under 20 years of age. Planning for the 
administration of this large population, considering their 
educational, cultural, and social needs, requires special care 
and sensitivity. Transmission of Islamic and revolutionary 
culture to this generation through appropriate ways and methods 
and protecting them against the Western cultural invasion are 
major duties of the government and all those in the society who 
are concerned, because the same strata must take on its 
shoulders the responsibility of perpetrating the Islamic 
revolution tomorrow. In the opinion of many contemporary 
thinkers, human resources are the main wealth of a society, 
provided they are trained, equipped with technical knowledge, 
and skillful. It can be said that the future wealth of our 
country is dependent on the level of investment in education. By 
combining the trained human resources with natural resources, 
our country can attain great power and reach a higher growth. 
  5) In connection with the implementation of the directives 
of 
the grand leader concerning decreasing consumption, in my 
opinion, the method of taxation on consumption must be used to 
achieve the desired results. Unfortunately, the level of 
consumption in the country is very high. 
  In conclusion, he thanked the governor-general of Esfahan 
for 
visiting the cities of the province and creating understanding 
and the minister of energy and the head of the Plan and Budget 
Organization for the rapid implementation of the water outreach 
project to Na'in and Khoy. 
<H5>  Hasan Mokhtari, Deputy From Najafabad </H5>
  The third pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was Mokhtari from Najafabad, who said: The 
beloved people of Iran know that despite the imposed war during 
the revolution, essential, constructive, and fundamental work 
has progressed well in society. However, what has perhaps caused 
the discontent of the people is the lack of control in society. 
Also, goods and production are not controlled as they should be, 
and the economic policies do not consider the welfare of the 
people. 
  Continuing, he said: The government must find ways to 
prevent pressure on such strata other than eliminating 
subsidies, in order for them to be able to carry the burden of 
the society further, because the burden of the perpetuation of 
the revolution is also on the shoulders of these dear ones. At 
the present time, foreign currency in our society is smuggled 
out of the country by the wealth-accumulating smugglers. All 
the foreign currency taken abroad is not to import machinery or 
resources to the country; therefore, we should choose a 
mechanism that goes through the banks. 
  He added: At the present time, factories, due to financial 
inability, the increase in the price of foreign currency, and 
the number of imports that exist in the country, do not have the 
manpower they need and face one problem after another. The 
factory closures, in addition to putting pressure on the economy 
and the deprived working class, causes social corruption. One 
way to fight corruption is to create jobs in society. 
  In connection with control, he said: There is no control in 
society. Taxis are placed at the disposal of taxi owners at the 
government rate; but in Tehran, no one has yet been able to 
control taxi fares. And the taxi driver, from where he picks up 
a passenger to where he drops the passenger off, is 
disrespectful to all government officials in order to justify 
his own violations. People still cannot understand why water is 
30 tomans per kg [as published], sugar is 100 tomans per kg, 
then, how is it that pastries, in this country, are 300 tomans 
per kg. Supply and demand alone cannot solve these problems. 
  Stating that the economic policies must be revised and the 
policy makers must revise their views, he said: It is 
unfortunate that when Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani came to Esfahan, 
one of the high-raking officials in a meeting asked how much the 
rate of foreign currency would be by the end of 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994]. He responded that it would be 110 tomans, 
which resulted in the laughter of those present. I am astonished 
how an economic policy maker of ours who is still influential in 
political issues can have such a viewpoint and hope to deal with 
the political issues of the country. 
  Then, referring to the self-sacrifice of the people of 
Najafabad, he said: In continuing the path of the revolution and 
in order to show their obedience to the grand leader and 
preserve the prominent personalities in society, (the people of 
Najafabad) contributed the highest percentage of votes in the 
presidential elections in the province, with a 5-percent 
increase, and extended an unprecedented welcome to Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. This shows the loyalty of these people to a 
regime in which no one has invested as much as they have. They 
are fond of the regime of the Islamic Republic and the 
leadership. But these dear people are very fond of the revered 
Shi'ite source of emulation, Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, because 
in our society emulation of a particular person is not an 
offense, a religious jurist is not elected, and the people have 
been and are as they are. But because of this issue, today some 
allow themselves to carry out their objectives merely by 
defending the religious guardians in that city. This has 
weakened the morale of the people, a people who have proved in 
practice before everyone else that they are the followers of the 
religious guardian. The dear people of Najafabad are upset with 
journalists who for reasons of expediency accuse him and his 
emulators of whatever they wish in their newspapers. A spokesman 
who may not even be considered his pupil allows himself to 
question his emulators, himself, and his students and make any 
kind of insult and injustice against him. I propose to the 
prominent people that this action is neither in the interest of 
the regime nor the grand clerics, nor is it good for the unity 
of the people. How can we benefit from such behavior toward a 
person about whom the Imam said, Your views give heat to the 
seminaries and the sacred Islamic regime? We request of the 
prominent people that such behavior be stopped and that the 
hearts of the people not be wounded. 
<H5>  Barat'ali Mohammadifar, Deputy From Sanqez and Kolia'i </H5>
  The last pre-agenda speaker of the open session of the 
Majles 
was Mohammadifar, from Sanqez and Kolia'i, who said: Since the 
examination of the budget bill will have two rounds of 
discussions, only the revenues will be examined, and most of the 
Majles committees will propose new taxes to secure the revenue 
resources, some of which are reasonable and some unreasonable, 
and on the whole the result will be higher prices for goods and 
services, the collection of taxes within the framework of the 
law is desirable. But to put taxes on everything will cause 
great problems. The next issue is the failure to observe social 
justice in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
distribution. The budget must be distributed among the provinces 
in such a way that justice and fairness are observed so that not 
the slightest right of any of the provinces is violated. 
  Continuing he said: Justice in the distribution of the 
budget must be such that everyone enjoys the resources equally 
in proportion to the population and the vastness of the 
province. But, unfortunately, we see that welfare resources in 
some provinces are in abundance and in some others deprivation 
rules. Today, the serving government must sincerely and 
decisively defend the rights of the people of all provinces, and 
the ministries must avoid additional expenditures. 
  Referring to the tricks of the oppressors in their hostility 
towards the Islamic Republic of Iran, the speaker continued: 
Apparently, in our country the best and most studied programs 
being implemented suffer from the most trivial administrative 
and service obstacles, and ultimately if they are saved, only a 
useless and weak shell of them remains. 
  Hence, any movement to suppress and reform this structure 
will face the violent reaction and discontent of a number of 
people. But discontent and the violation of the rights of tens 
of millions of people of our country are much more significant. 
Any study in regards to administrative corruption, bureaucracy, 
and red tape in our country shows that this issue is at the root 
of most of the discontent in our country and a legacy of the 
corrupt monarchical bureaucracy. In fact, reform of the 
administrative system is the wish of the revolutionary society 
and will result in increased national wealth. Avoiding luxury 
and showing respect for the people are important duties of the 
officials. 
  The speaker then added: Some officials act on promises 
concerning the elimination of the problems, but some of the 
officials only do so at the level of slogans and do not act on 
their obligations. Hence, the Majles must make every effort to 
eliminate deprivation. 
  He also said: One of the slogans of the regime of the 
Islamic 
Republic is support for the oppressed. Social justice is a 
central issue that the grand leader determined for the Second 
Plan and must not be forgotten under the pretext of development 
of social justice and support for the oppressed and the 
downtrodden, who are the main supporters of the revolution. 
  It is expected that in economic planning the authentic 
duties 
of the revolution will not be trampled. And the reason why the 
statements of the grand leader have had an effect on the soul of 
the people must be kept in mind, since his reverence is not 
inclined towards this world and towards luxury and he loves 
Islam and the next world. It is hoped that the same is true of 
all the officials. 
  In conclusion, the deputy of Sanqez and Kolia'i asked the 
high-ranking officials of the province of Kermanshah to 
disregard certain marginal tasks that are not listed in their 
duties and asked the head of the Judicial Branch to see that the 
embezzlers in the Reconstruction Headquarters of the province of 
Kermanshah are brought to a speedy trial and punishment. 
<H5>  Ratifications </H5>
<H3>  Return of the Bill on Ratifying the Charter of the 
International Engineering and [Genetics] Center </H3>
  The first item on the agenda of the open session of the 
Majles yesterday was the government's request to return the bill 
on the ratification of the charter of the International 
Engineering, Genetics, and Biotechnology Center (returned from 
the Council), and the request was ratified. 
<H3>  Report on the Settlement of the 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 
1992] Budget </H3>
  The second item on the agenda was the report of the 
Accounting [and Budget] Committee concerning the settlement of 
the 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] budget. 
  Mr. Ja'fari, the spokesman of the Accounting [and Budget] 
Committee in reporting the settlement of the 1370 [21 March 
1991-20 March 1992] Majles budget, mentioned the goals of this 
action and then read the results of the audit and analysis as 
follows: 
  1) In major cases, the honorable board of directors of the 
Majles is informed about the affairs and issued the necessary 
permission. 
  2) The honorable supply officials, based on the authority 
given in Article 186 of the internal bylaws of the Majles, 
verified and signed the expenditure and payment documents of the 
Majles. 
  3) Copies of the major accounts in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 
March 1992] were similar to copies of previous years and 
government accounting. 
  After mentioning the current and developmental budget 
operations of the Majles, the spokesman of the Committee 
referred to the shortcomings of the financial operations and the 
use of the funds of the administrative organization of the 
Majles and said: The main deficiencies and criticism concern a 
lack of specific financial bylaws and subsequently various views 
and interpretations of the existing financial laws and 
regulations. 
  1) As was announced in the report of the previous year, 
according to Article 53 of the Constitution, all payments must 
be made within the limits of the ratified funds in accordance 
with the law. The financial bylaws of the Majles must be 
ratified by the honorable Majles as soon as possible. In 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994], the financial bylaws of the 
Majles have been ratified by the honorable Majles, which, God 
willing, will be implemented from 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995]. 
  2) Failure to send the unused funds of the current 1370 [21 
March 1991-20 March 1992] budget on time is contrary to Note 61 
of the 1360 [21 March 1981-20 March 1982] budget law. 
  3) It is appropriate for suitable steps to be taken to 
collect the debts of the honorable deputies in the previous 
session. The remainder of this debt at the end of 1370 [21 March 
1991-20 March 1992] is 377,385,920 rials[R]. 
  4) The remainder of credit of the annual savings account at 
the end of 1370 [20 March 1992] was R192,965,360. As has been 
announced in the audit report of the previous year, all these 
amounts must be deposited in the account of the Treasury. 
  5) Payment from the funds in Article 17 (expenditure 
account) 
totals R187,725,687. This figure has increased about 110 percent 
compared to previous years. It is necessary to explain that from 
these funds, the aid expenditures are in connection with the 
goals of the organization, whereas in accordance with the list 
stated in the text of the report, most of the payments concern 
aid to Majles employees and deputies. Such payments must be made 
in accordance with the law from their related funds. 
  6) The remainder of the special revenues must be deposited 
in 
the account of the Treasury. The remainder of this account at 
the end of 1370 [20 March 1992] amounts to R415,089,436. The 
remainder of some of the annual prepayments from the previous 
years must be followed up and steps taken for their deposit. 
  In the conclusion of this report, Beytollah Ja'fari added: 
The Majles financial affairs has had the utmost cooperation of 
the Auditing Committee, and the shortages announced in 1370 are 
much less than those in the previous years. 
<H5>  Return of the Bill on Law Enforcement Employment Regulations </H5>
  The next item on the agenda was a request by a number of 
deputies concerning the return of the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
law enforcement employment regulations on the basis of Article 
85 of the Constitution to the related committee. This request 
was ratified by the deputies. 
<H3>  Proposal To Determine the Regulations on Selection of 
Teachers </H3>
  The fourth item on the agenda was the report on the first 
round of discussions of the joint Education and Administrative 
and Employment Affairs Committee concerning the proposal to 
determine the regulations on the selection of teachers. Engineer 
Qomi, the spokesman of the Education Committee in explaining 
this proposal said: 
  Every year in education we have to hire about 60,000 people 
and this number is equal to hiring in other government 
organizations and institutions. If selection in education is 
done well, it can be a good model for other revolutionary 
organizations. About 12 years passed since 1361 [21 March 
1982-20 March 1983], when on the order of the Imam, the issue of 
selection was changed. Unfortunately, we still do not have a 
ratified law for this issue in the Majles. Of course, the Majles 
in the past sessions had ratified the general points regarding 
selection. But specifically in connection with selection 
regarding education, we have problems. He added: In regards to 
the Selection Committee, a committee has been specified that is 
in accordance with the decree of the Imam. And since the grand 
leader also is especially concerned about education and 
selection, we request that considering the large number who want 
to be teachers and the importance of this task, careful 
requirements must be imposed to choose the best to serve the 
revolution generation in this cultural stronghold. 
  After the opposing and supporting speeches, the general 
points of the proposal was ratified. 
<H3>  Proposal To Amend Some Articles of the Internal Bylaws of 
the Majles </H3>
  The last item on the agenda was a report by the Committee To 
Devise the Internal Bylaws of the Majles in regards to amending 
some articles of the Majles bylaws, the examination of which was 
postponed to the next session. 
<H5>  On the Margins of the Majles </H5>
<H5>  Inquiry and Investigation Concerning Foreign Travel </H5>
  A member of the inquiry and investigation group of the 
Majles 
concerning foreign trends told our parliamentary reporter: The 
period for inquiry and investigation is two months, which will 
be extended upon the request of the group members and the 
foreign policy committee. This has not been done and the report 
has not been presented to the Majles. Hence, it is understood 
that this has been negligence in carrying out this 
responsibility, and the task is not merely the desired proposal. 
Given the importance of this issue and most of the assignments 
of the government experts, which are not necessary in some 
cases, and the shortage of foreign currency funds in the 
country, serious attention to inquiry and investigation is 
necessary. As a person requesting this issue of the group and 
the committee, I expect this issue not to be delayed more than 
this. 
<H5>  New Year Bonus of Employees and Workers </H5>
  Mr. Rowghani-Zanjani, the head of the Plan and Budget 
Organization, told our reporter yesterday: This year, a month's 
salary will be paid as a New Year's bonus to government 
employees. He gave no further explanation in this regard. 
  Also, Mr. Kamali, the minister of labor and social affairs, 
announced the amount of the New Year bonus of workers eligible 
for the labor law to be two months' salary and added: An 
increase in the wages of workers based on the rate of inflation 
is being studied, which will be announced as soon as the 
decision has been made. 
<H5>  Joint Session of the Cabinet Ministers and Majles Deputies </H5>
  The parliamentary correspondent of RESALAT was informed that 
tonight a joint session of the Cabinet ministers and Majles 
deputies will be held. In this session, a number of deputies and 
ministers along with the president will comment on the most 
important economic issues and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March

  [Text] The Majles met in open session yesterday and Mr. 
Khatami, Mr. Qazipur, Mr. Rashidi, Mr. Ja'fari, and Mr. 
Movahedi-Saveji, deputies from the cities of Borujerd, Ardebil, 
Darab, Urmia, and Tehran, gave pre-agenda speeches. The Majles 
then took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our 
respected readers to the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Majles Highlights </H5>
<H5>  Speeches </H5>
  Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from Tehran, discussed dealing 
decisively with agents of corruption and deviation. He said this 
will reform the nation's affairs. 
  Beytollah Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia, asked the government 
to 
allocate subsidies for social justice, so that the low-income 
classes can make use of them before the prosperous classes do. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  Dr. Raja'i-Khorasani spoke in favor of increasing the 
Islamic 
Republic of Iran's share in the World Bank's IMF [as published]. 
He said: Contrary to what has been said, this bank is in the 
service of Third World people and it takes the side of the 
private companies. Continuing, he said ironically: If they were 
going to dissolve the World Bank, we would vote to dissolve it. 
<H5>  Hadi Khatami, Deputy From Borujerd </H5>
  If executive policies and programs are not compatible with 
planning, it will not be practical to reach the goals in the 
Second Five-Year Plan. 
  Hadi Khatami was the first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's 
open Majles session. During his speech he discussed the arrival 
of the middle of the month of Sha'ban [14 January-11 February] 
and offered congratulations on the birth anniversary of His 
Holiness Qa'em. Continuing his remarks, he said: God forbid that 
tomorrow the shame of ingratitude, lack of steadfastness, and 
ignoring the principles and provisions of the Constitution, or 
breaking the pact and tie with the people should be written on 
one or two of our foreheads. 
  Because the Majles consideration of the Second Five-Year 
Plan 
has been moved to the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], 
and on the other hand next year's national budget will also 
differ from that of previous years in view of the new 
guidelines, and will be studied and approved in two 
consultations, this bill will be approved by the end of the 
month of Esfand [29 March] this year. 
  In view of the current political and cultural conditions, 
the 
economic changes and the new foreign exchange structure, it is 
appropriate to take a profound look and make a careful study of 
the goals, policies and programs of the next four years in the 
context of what will be approved in the Second Five-Year Plan 
Law. The strengths, weaknesses, and experiences of the last four 
years and the strengths and weaknesses in the First Five-Year 
Plan must also be studied to remove the executive obstacles, 
because it cannot suffice to consider only the theories and 
experiences of the last four years and the projections for the 
future. 
  He emphasized: Unfortunately, the lack of skills and 
familiarity on the part of some officials with the 
responsibilities assigned and existing problems and their causes 
was in conflict with the policies of the previous Five-Year Plan 
and the promises its executive officers made for the future. 
This inevitably demands an appropriate and hopeful atmosphere 
concerning the policies and programs of the Second Five-Year 
Plan. 
  Of course, the previous accomplishments of those carrying 
out 
society's policies and programs have prepared society for 
acceptance. However, a basic requirement for attracting public 
confidence and consequently the success of each economic and 
political program and also for meeting basic needs, is faith on 
the part of the executive officers in their policies and the 
firmness of the measures they take. 
  If executive policies and programs are not compatible with 
planning and if the basic obstacles remain unrecognized, we must 
believe that it will not be practical to make the expenditures 
and investments and employ manpower desiring to meet the goals 
established in the Second Five-Year Plan, and it will also waste 
the resources and abilities of the nation's skilled manpower. 
Therefore, efforts to achieve the goals in the Second Five-Year 
Plan must be accompanied by taking the following measures: 
  Strengthening the foundations of faith among the executive 
officers, spreading Islamic morality and culture, increasing 
policymaking abilities, increasing specialist abilities, making 
efforts to hire knowledgeable manpower, expanding research units 
for the best application and utilization of specialist manpower, 
encouraging cultural units and raising the quality and quantity 
of knowledge, making efforts to prepare the environment and 
create the necessary facilities for private sector investment, 
teaching new management concepts, expanding manpower resources 
compatible with the nation's values and cultural principles, 
emphasizing studies and applied research, creating and expanding 
foundations and organizations, creating a suitable atmosphere 
for the growth and development of investment to increase the 
nation's economic ability with emphasis on public participation, 
increasing policymaking abilities, planning and persistence in 
meeting public needs, spreading Islamic morality and ethics and 
spreading the new moral concepts. 
<H5>  Morteza Qazipur, Deputy From Ardebil </H5>
  To achieve social justice, the path to waste, excess, and 
extra expenditures is closed, and we will deal with violators 
through full supervision and earnestness. 
  The next speaker was Qazipur, deputy from Ardebil. During 
his 
speech he offered congratulations and felicitations on the birth 
anniversary of His Holiness Mehdi (peace be upon him). He said: 
The Fourth Majles, which has performed its duties successfully 
so far, has done its basic work and is about to consider the 
Second Five-Year Plan and the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget. May it demonstrate the worthiness of the children of the 
Islamic revolution. 
  Continuing, he said: As the exalted leader of the Islamic 
revolution emphasized, social justice is the most essential 
issue to be considered in writing programs and preparing the 
budget. 
  He said: To achieve social justice, the path to waste, 
excess, and extra expenditures is closed, and we will deal with 
violators through full supervision and earnestness. We must give 
more attention to the nation's deprived and remote areas, which 
have been treated unkindly throughout history and are still 
faced with many problems now, and we must pay more attention to 
their malfunctions and problems. 
  In the era of reconstruction, serious attention must be paid 
to agriculture. In this regard, the speaker thanked the minister 
of agriculture for the Ministry of Agriculture's planning in the 
First Five-Year Plan, and called for basic change in this area. 
  The deputy from Ardebil also said: In view of the fact that 
it has been 10 months since the final approval and announcement 
of the formation of the province of Ardebil, I thank the first 
vice-president of the republic and ask that serious measures be 
taken to expedite implementation of this law and divide the 
resources and assets between the provinces of East Azerbaijan 
and Ardebil. 
  Continuing, he said: Although it has been three years since 
the opening of the Ardebil airport, the flights are still 
irregular and the airport is yet to be equipped with 
navigational equipment and other necessities. I ask the minister 
of roads and transportation to pay more attention to this 
matter, and I consider it necessary that special priority be 
given in the Second Five-Year Plan to studying and implementing 
the project for the railroad through Khalkhal, Ardebil, Meshkin 
Shahr, and Moghan. 
  At the end of his speech Qazipur asked the relevant 
officials 
to issue the orders necessary to begin construction on the 
Ardebil Province Power Plant and Petrochemical Factory. 
<H5>  Hoseyn Rashidi, Deputy From Darab </H5>
  It is necessary to do basic thinking about the government 
companies, whose budget is 67 percent of the total government 
budget. 
  The next speaker was Rashidi, deputy from Darab. He offered 
congratulations on the middle of the month of Sha'ban [14 
January-11 February] and the joyous birth anniversary of the 
savior of humanity, the Imam of the age (may God hasten his 
joyful advent) and the anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution. During his speech he said: 
  We are on the eve of the anniversary of the flowering of the 
Islamic revolution, the revolution that saved the country from 
the domination of foreigners and which made our society 
glorious. Today the Islamic Republic of Iran is the only 
government that has stood up manfully against those who rule 
with oppression and force, those who use the international 
organizations as a means to put down freethinkers and seekers of 
independence, and those who support human rights as a way to put 
down oppressed nations, especially the world's awakened Muslims, 
and which has given them the sweet taste of victory. 
  Continuing, the speaker emphasized the need for the nation 
to 
follow the late Imam (peace be upon him) and the exalted leader, 
and cited a few statistics about the revolution's achievements. 
He said: Comparative statistics for some activities in the years 
1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] and 1371 [21 March 1992-20 
March 1993]: Capacity of the universities increased from 175,000 
to 852,000, the number of students increased from seven million 
to 17 million, the number of classes increased from 206,000 to 
515,000, the number of educational sites increased from 48,000 
to 87,000, the production of electrical power increased from 17 
million kilowatt hours [kwhr] in the year 1356 [21 March 1977-20 
March 1978] to 63 million kwhr in the year 1371, and the number 
of villages with electrical power increased from 4,000 to 26,000. 
  The number of working telephones increased from 858,000 in 
the year 1357 to 3.48 million in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994], wheat production increased from 3 million to 10 
million tons, rice production increased from 700,000 tons to 
4.55 million tons, sugar beet production increased from 3 
million tons to 5.8 million tons, and sugar-cane production 
increased to 1.64 million tons. 
  The statistics mentioned bespeak the sincere efforts of our 
officials and people to achieve self-sufficiency and make use of 
existing resources, which have been followed by outstanding 
growth and commendable development. The hope was that with 
comprehensive planning and making the best use of talents, we 
would not need to be dependent on foreign technology and raw 
materials. 
  Rashidi then said: In view of our nation's special situation 
and the problems the superpowers and bullies have created for 
our nation, I call upon the deputies to consider carefully the 
articles in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, and 
not to forget the effects of their decisions in bringing 
pressure on the low-income classes, on the wages of workers and 
salaries of staff and on the growth of currency in circulation 
and inflation. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Pointless price increases made 
without calculating their negative effects on society must be 
earnestly avoided. Any kind of increase must be proportionate to 
the livelihood of low-income people, worker wages and staff 
salaries, in order to achieve social justice. 
  The deputy from Darab called for investigation and 
supervision of the budget for government companies, whose 
numbers are undetermined, in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995]. Despite the use of 7,000 billion rials[R] in 
banking facilities, they will put the pressure of almost R4,000 
billion in losses on the public budget. The question for the 
government companies is, in selecting the investment projects, 
have the effects of their implementation been studied in social 
and economic terms? 
  It is necessary that basic thinking be done for the 
government companies, whose budget is 67 percent of the total 
government budget. 
  The speaker also added: In studying the budget bill, one 
cannot trust the work of the executive organizations preparing 
it, because they have no logical answer or justification for 
some of the numbers and figures they have put in the bill. This 
multiplies our responsibility and investigative task several 
times over. 
  Continuing, he issued the following memos to the government: 
The nation's main problem is its administrative structure, and 
until this system changes there can be little hope of improving 
the administrative, economic, and social situation. Another 
matter is the failure to use committed, specialist experts who 
toil for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Why are knowledgeable and 
capable managers not used? Why are most managers chosen based on 
the recommendations of personal connections or based on 
government relations, rather than on worthiness, competence, 
commitment, piety and work knowledge? How long will our noble 
and honorable nation be subjected to bad management? 
  In conclusion, he issued several memos concerning his 
electoral district. 
<H5>  Beytollah Ja'fari, Deputy From Urmia </H5>
  The next speaker was Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia. During his 
speech he said: Let us not forget that our belief in the 
imamate, the vice-regency and our faith in God and our national 
unity triumphed over world imperialism and despotism. Let us, 
therefore, work together on the Second Five-Year Plan so that a 
livelihood may be provided for the deprived classes, the 
workers, the farmers and the staff workers. Let us prevent price 
increases, and let us revise the government's economic policies, 
especially from this point of view. Instead of insisting on the 
inflationary course of the past, let us stop waste, bad 
management, ostentation, and embezzlement. 
  He then discussed his electoral district. He said: The 
shipment of kerosene to Urmia has declined since 1 Dey [22 
December], and something must be done quickly to send kerosene. 
The request from the noble teachers is that the bill on the 
retirement of government employees and to lift the current 
ceiling on pensions be approved in such a way that it provides a 
minimum livelihood for retirees. 
  Continuing, the speaker discussed the outstanding victory at 
the Asia boxing matches by our nation's athletes, who were 
championship finalists. He expressed regret at the cold and weak 
coverage of this provided by the Voice and Vision organization. 
  At the end of his speech he called upon the zealous people 
and especially the youth of Urmia to show their firm faith in 
Islam, the Imam's path and that of the exalted leader of the 
Islamic revolution on God's Day 22 Bahman [11 February] by 
turning out for the enemy-defeating demonstrations. 
<H5>  'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  During the Second Five-Year Plan and the period of 
reconstruction we were unable to bring the people into public 
affairs in place of the government. 
  The final speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from Tehran. 
He 
discussed the beginning of the 10 Days' Dawn Celebration and the 
birth of His Holiness Mehdi (may God hasten his joyful advent) 
and offered congratulations. He said: It has been almost 15 
years since the triumph of the revolution. The experience prior 
to the revolution was one of brave resistance. After the 
revolution our nation learned the lesson that as long as our 
nation's leaders, officials and workers have faith, sincerity 
and good intentions and are working to serve Islam, the nation 
and the revolution, it is certain that no danger can threaten 
our nation and revolution. 
  He added: For us to achieve our lofty revolutionary and 
Islamic goals, one of which is to spread the Islamic revolution 
in the world and another of which is to establish social justice 
inside the country and make Islam and the laws of Islamic 
justice prevail in our own country, we must have several 
elements. One is strong and authoritative leadership, another is 
to make use of all experiences and to understand weaknesses and 
shortcomings, and finally we must compensate for the weaknesses 
of the past. 
  He emphasized dealing with agents of corruption and 
deviation. He said: It makes no difference if corruption and 
deviation are moral, political, economic, social or cultural. In 
order for us to take care of these people, I think a change must 
be made in us. Praise God, at the head of the nation we have at 
our disposal pure, sincere, serving and toiling people. Not only 
are we not hopeless about the nation's future, but we are also 
moving forward with faith and complete hope in God and in the 
believing revolutionary forces in our country, and we believe 
that we can be successful. 
  Movahedi-Saveji continued: I believe that since the period 
of 
the imposed war, during the Five-Year Plan and the nation's 
construction and reconstruction and during the period when we 
tried to bring the people into public life instead of having the 
government rule over every person and every thing, we have not 
had great success. 
  The correct and proper experiences of the nations that have 
advanced in science, economic affairs and industry, though they 
do not share our goals and beliefs, can be instructive for us. 
One of their experiences was that no country can advance 
industrially, economically, scientifically, and socially without 
a strong and authoritative government that deals decisively with 
corruption, deviation, abuses, theft, bribery, and embezzlement. 
Likewise, we must make use of public participation and 
involvement in public affairs, we must make use of valuable and 
worthy manpower, and we must make use of the resources and 
abilities of the people. Unfortunately, we took steps in this 
area in the Five-Year Plan, but we were not successful. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H5>  With Majles Approval </H5>
<H3>  Investment by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the World Bank 
To Increase </H3>
<H5>  Motion To Amend Articles of Majles Internal Guidelines </H5>

  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Majles Internal Guidelines 
Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Articles of Majles 
Internal Guidelines, which was rejected after talks by opponents 
and supporters and a member of the commission. It is worth 
mentioning that this bill was tabled for six months. Under this 
motion, the number of Majles commissions was to decrease from 25 
to three. 
  Concerning this motion, a member of the Majles Internal 
Guidelines Commission said: Now when the second consultation is 
held for bills and motions, the commission meets with nine 
people and the motion will pass in the second consultation with 
five votes. In open session, 18 deputies can eliminate it. At 
least 91 people should vote to reject the decisions of the five 
people. Among this motion's other messages is the replacement of 
the sector perspective with the general perspective. What is the 
need for us to have both a Labor and Social Affairs Commission 
and an Employment Affairs Commission? These two can be 
consolidated, and we can consolidate the Foreign Policy and 
Defense Affairs commissions. 
  After this speech a vote was taken and this motion was 
rejected. 
<H3>  Increasing Iran's Investment in IMF Affiliated With the 
World Bank [as published] </H3>
  The next item on the agenda was the bill to increase the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's investment in the IMF, affiliated 
with the World Bank. Concerning this, the deputy minister of 
finance said: Increasing our investment in this company will 
increase our financial credibility and prestige at the 
international level and will increase our country's vote in this 
international organization. This company has nothing to do with 
governments that take loans from the World Bank, because this 
company has relations only with the private sectors in member 
nations. 
  In this regard, Mr. Rashidi of the Economic and Financial 
Affairs Commission said: We became a member of the fund in the 
year 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992]. We now have shares of 
$816,000, and another $818,000 is to be added to our share. This 
fund provides financial and technical assistance to member 
nations for their development. 
  Then Mr. Jabarzadeh said in opposition: The nations that 
have 
used the World Bank's resources have destroyed their agriculture 
and the farmers in those countries have become unemployed. The 
World Bank's conditions include the elimination of subsidies for 
necessary consumer goods and no control of prices, which will 
cause inflation. Another disadvantage is that small local 
companies will go bankrupt. 
  Speaking in support, Mr. Raja'i-Khorasani said: Under the 
policies of the World Bank, total disasters do not happen. In 
the Rudbar earthquake, the World Bank loaned us $250 million, 
and the projects that were carried out immediately in this 
connection were from this very bank's loans. Raja'i said we must 
not weaken ourselves and the people of the Third World. Then a 
vote was taken and the motion was approved. It is necessary to 
mention that if this bill is approved in the second consultation 
our nation's investment will increase from $817,000 to $1.444 
million. 
<H3>  Appending Note To Law Exempting the Municipality of Tehran 
From the Owners and Renters Law </H3>
  Another item on the agenda was appending Note 1 to the Law 
Exempting the Municipality of Tehran From the Owners and Renters 
Law With Regard to the Transfer of Some Parks, Squares and 
Public Assets, which was not approved by the deputies. 
  This bill provides that if the municipality transfers parks 
and squares to the people, first of all, after the termination 
of the contract a key deposit will not be taken by the municipal 
side and second the Owners and Renters Law will not apply in 
case of the eviction of a renter and if evacuation is requested 
by the municipality through the Tehran public prosecutor, the 
evacuation will take place within two months. With the rejection 
of this bill, such cases will be subject to the Owners and 
Renters Law. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
  At yesterday's open Majles session Mr. Movahedi-Saveji, 
deputy from Tehran, cited Note 2, Article 1 of the Law on 
Procedures for Dealing With the Budget Bill, which has to do 
with amending the Majles Internal Guidelines. He said: The joint 
Plan and Budget, Economic Affairs and Cooperatives Commissions 
are required within one month of the submission of the budget to 
submit a report on their first consultation to the Majles for 
study, to include the revenues section. However, it has been 
more than one month since the budget bill was submitted to the 
Majles and the joint commissions still have not submitted the 
report on their work to the Majles. In answer, deputy speaker 
M.r Movahedi-Kermani said: We are studying.

  [Text] The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by 
Mr. Rowhani, deputy speaker, after a one-hour delay. Mr. 
Purqorbani, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Zare' and Mr. Rasulnezhad, deputies 
from the cities of Kalibar, Falavarjan, Shiraz and Damavand and 
Firuzkuh gave pre-agenda speeches. Then the Majles took up its 
agenda, and we present the detailed proceedings below for our 
esteemed readers. 
<H5>  Deputy Speaker's Remarks </H5>
  Dr. Hasan Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, gave a 
short 
speech in honor of the joyous birth anniversary of the promoter 
of justice in the world and the savior of all the world's 
deprived and oppressed people, His Holiness the promised Mehdi 
(may God hasten his joyful advent). He said: There is no doubt 
that belief in Mehdi and expectation in its general sense is not 
only limited to Shi'ites, but may not even be limited to 
Muslims. In all those religions based on celestial truth, this 
belief has always been a very important factor for hope and 
action in important social affairs, and many important 
liberation movements have arisen from this excellent source. He 
also said: There is no doubt that the greatest problem facing 
human society today is oppression and the lack of or shortage of 
justice, the same thing that will bring about that holy man's 
righteous government. 
  The deputy speaker added: In the traditions that have 
reached 
us from the exalted prophets and the imams (peace be upon them), 
one of the greatest goals in that holy man's uprising was 
justice and fairness. Unfortunately, in the course of history in 
past centuries through today, humanity is still suffering from 
the lack of justice and from oppression and extortion, even in 
new forms. The greatest celestial gift for all oppressed people 
is justice. There is no doubt that anticipation of that day has 
been and is our greatest asset, and all basic movements that 
have taken place in our society have always been affected by 
expectation. 
<H5>  Khan'ali Purqorbani, Deputy From Kalibar </H5>
  The basic focus and the Muslim vice-regent's emphasis has 
been attention to the vulnerable classes in society and the 
nation's deprived areas. 
  The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Purqorbani, deputy from Kalibar. He offered 
congratulations and felicitations on the birth anniversary of 
His Holiness Mehdi (may God hasten his joyful advent) and on the 
15th anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution. He 
discussed the fact that we are seeing the appearance and 
manifestation of Islamic movements and uprisings all over the 
world. During his talk he said: Based on Article 84 of the 
Constitution, you deputies have sworn before God and the nation 
that you are representatives of the entire nation and are 
responsible to the nation of Iran. Since you have been informed 
of the exalted leader's views concerning the Five-Year Plan and 
you know that the basic focus and main emphasis in the words of 
the vice-regent of the Muslims is securing social justice and 
attention to the vulnerable class of society and the nation's 
deprived areas, it is therefore just, before thinking about 
districts and provinces and working to insert budget rows and 
obtain credits for projects in your electoral districts, to 
consider God and earnestly avoid price increases, which have 
cast a shadow like a terrifying nightmare over the lives of the 
deprived and society's vulnerable classes, because the nation 
can never be summarized in the framework of a few cities or 
provinces. 
  Continuing, he said: Although we are fully aware of the 
investments in all economic, cultural, development, defense, and 
welfare sectors in the framework of the First Five-Year Plan and 
in this regard outstanding successes have truly been gained by 
the people and the nation of Iran, we can never forget the great 
sector of people and regions in the rural areas and in the 
nation's border territories. 
  The speaker also said: Of course, we have the confident hope 
that you respected deputies, with your God-pleasing work and 
your conscience as deputies, will fill these gaps of deprivation 
here and there in the budget and that in this regard my own 
electoral district will not be forgotten. The municipality of 
Kalibar is suffering increasing deprivation. It does not have 
even one prosperous area. Unfortunately, in the First Five-Year 
Plan it has not tasted prosperity. With a rural and urban 
population of 140,000, it does not have a single asphalt 
connective road or a single emergency hospital bed. Even the 
center of the municipality lacks potable water. Just as our 
forefathers left this world waiting for promises to be 
fulfilled, we also wait. 
  He then discussed rural emigration, the abandonment of rural 
areas for prosperous cities and working in false jobs. 
Continuing, he asked the deputies and the respected government 
for help and called for special attention to the following: 
Expedited establishment and construction of the 96-bed Kalibar 
hospital, expedited road construction for Urdeh and Kalibar, 
water service for the municipality of Kalibar and its affiliated 
villages, commencement of work on the Khoda Afarin dam, the 
allocation of sufficient credit, and comprehensive support from 
the president of the republic's deprived areas office, which is 
the only supporter of the deprived areas. 
  In conclusion, Purqorbani praised and thanked the minister 
of 
the reconstruction crusade, the governor-general of East 
Azarbaijan and other area officials for their attention to this 
deprived area. 
<H5>  Hoseyn Kiani, Deputy From Falavarjan </H5>
  We Majles deputies must not allow something to become 
expensive at our hands. 
  The next speaker was Kiani, deputy from Falavarjan. He 
offered congratulations and felicitations on the arrival of 15 
Sha'ban [28 January] and the birth anniversary of the only 
savior of the world of humanity His Holiness the vice-regent and 
Imam of the age (may God hasten his joyful advent). He said: 
Throughout the implementation of the reconstruction, economic 
adjustment, social justice, unification of the foreign exchange 
rate and major investments for self-sufficiency, there were also 
shortcomings and mistakes, and it can be said that these are the 
cause of most of our current problems. We must not ignore this. 
Insufficient work, wasteful spending, disorganization, abuses, 
especially in contracts and domestic and foreign purchases, with 
direct selections and sales sometimes replacing competitive 
bidding, have caused delays in all projects, at rates several 
times higher than designated international prices. 
  Therefore, what should be done about market stagnation, high 
prices, inflation, bankruptcy, poverty, homeless, unemployment, 
false employment, illicit incomes, usury, swindling, corruption, 
theft, addiction, pessimism about officials, disgust with the 
revolution and the government, suicide, family quarrels, 
increased divorce, murder and crowded prisons? 
  Continuing, the speaker said: The Glorious Koran was 
revealed 
over a period of 23 years and its commands were gradually 
explained to the people. There is no reason for social justice 
and the government's programs to be implemented under pressure 
over a period of eight years, creating problems for the 
government itself, the people and the revolution. 
  He also said: The president of the republic said: "I would 
like to do all the work during my presidency so the next 
president of the republic will have nothing to do." Dear brother 
Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, I say that if others endure this 
pressure and hardship, that is better than having all the people 
anxious and unhappy, with all this nation's work being done in 
the short period of eight years. It is better if we do some of 
it in later years, so we do not make the people so unhappy, 
anxious, and under pressure to survive. Kiani then said to the 
Majles deputies: Last year it was approved in this very Majles 
that the government would not make any thing expensive in the 
year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], and we saw that in 
violation of the law everything became expensive. Our people are 
truly suffering. We cannot tell that poor old man, the worker, 
the staff employee or the crippled and disabled old woman why a 
small amount of electrical power costs them 27,000 tomans, 
15,000 tomans, and 30,000 tomans, or why other services are 
rendered to the people at high prices. 
  Continuing, Kiani added: Dear brothers, last year we voted 
that prices should not be high, and they made them high. Woe be 
unto us this year if the Majles votes for high prices. I hope 
the brothers and sisters will note carefully that the government 
has now sent Note 25 to the Majles in order to be able to solve 
its own problems in this way. We must not do anything to cause 
all the discomfort and anxiety to be blamed on the Majles. 
  Continuing his speech, he asked the deputies all to vote to 
eliminate Note 25. 
  In conclusion he said: We must not allow the Majles to make 
anything expensive. Even if we do this, like it or not, the 
government will raise prices, but it will not be done by the 
Majles. 
<H5>  Karim Zare', Deputy From Shiraz </H5>
  Human beings armed with the weapon of science and technology 
are the main agents in support of development. 
  The third pre-agenda speaker was Zare', deputy from Shiraz. 
He offered congratulations and felicitations on the esteemed 
birth anniversary of His Holiness the Imam of the Age (peace be 
upon him). During his speech he condemned the crimes of the 
aggressor Serbs and he called upon all free people to criticize 
the United Nations and to awaken sleeping consciences for the 
defense of the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia and Hercegovina. He 
called on the Indian Government to end its oppression and 
aggression in Kashmir. 
  Continuing, he then added: Human beings armed with the 
weapon 
of science and technology are the main agents in support of 
development. 
  The speaker then asked that we find a way of continued 
education for all those who want to be equipped with the weapon 
of knowledge, education and technology, and who want to 
participate in the world of the 21st century, which is the 
century of the movement of minds. 
  Continuing, he said: Today we see about 1.2 million people 
lining up for higher education. The first step is to reform 
higher education, meaning to expand the journeyman programs, 
which I have discussed previously in a project that received 
abundant approval from the deputies. In view of the limitations 
in the government budget for the expansion of higher education 
at this time and in view of the existing realities and 
shortages, provisions have been made for meeting the expenses of 
applicants to government and nongovernment institutions of 
higher education. Fortunately this motion is aimed at completing 
the motion approved by the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary 
Council and solving its main problem, which is securing a budget. 
  Continuing, Zare' said: Another issue is the necessity to 
expand the expert guidance and doctoral programs, as well as the 
post-doctoral or post-specialist programs at the universities, 
or research centers must be established that have high academic 
ability and potential resources. 
  He discussed the fact that the doctoral and post-doctoral 
programs cannot only make young researchers more practiced and 
experienced, but they can also procure employable research 
manpower for basic and applied research. 
  Continuing his talk, Mr. Zare' issued the following memo 
concerning the problems in his electoral district: I ask all 
members of the society of deputies, Friday imams and governors 
to show more concern for the cultural, sports, development and 
civil backwardness in the province of Fars. 
  He thanked the government for expediting the Shiraz-Esfahan 
railroad and for studying the Shiraz-Bushehr railroad, and he 
asked that measures be taken to deal with the deprivation in his 
electoral district. He also asked the minister of roads and 
transportation for help building the Shiraz-Esfahan freeway. 
  He also called for the encouragement of cities, villages and 
bridges that make the production of strategic goods their first 
priority. He thanked the respected president of the Supreme 
Cultural Revolution Council and its members for confirming the 
part-time teaching system at the Free Islamic University. At the 
end of his speech he also asked the minister of culture and 
higher education and the minister of health care, treatment and 
medical education to give more spiritual support to 
nongovernment and nonprofit universities. 
<H5>  Seyyed Ahmad Rasulinezhad, Deputy From Damavand And Firuzkuh </H5>
  The reason some of the things we say are not heard and the 
people do not accept and believe them is that they do not see 
anything in practice. 
  The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Rasulinezhad, deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh. He 
discussed the dangers of influence by foreigners and agents who 
have sold out through those dependent on personalities and 
officials. He said: The enemies of the Islamic revolution, who 
have given up gaining influence with top officials and 
government officials, are trying, with the help of their agents, 
to find their way into the gentlemen's homes. 
  Our late Imam said: "Keep watch over your homes." This 
remark 
was not addressed just to one person. This was addressed to 
everyone, to us deputies, to the executive power, to the 
judiciary and in two words, to the army and the nation. 
  He added: The question is, with whom do our children, those 
close to us and our relatives spend their time, where do they go 
and for what? Who plans the domestic and foreign trips, and who 
goes with them? It is very important to know who the consultants 
are and with whom they consult. How often in the future someone 
will commit a crime, make a mistake and commit an abuse, but due 
to his friends and colleagues and sometimes because he is 
presented as an insider, he will be freed from the clutches of 
justice and the trial. 
  He also discussed the tendency towards ostentation. He said: 
Among the dangers of the tendency towards ostentation is taking 
fancy and leisurely trips with people who live in comfort, are 
without religion and do not live simply. While some people are 
living in poverty and indigence, we are seeking to create a 
fancy and comfortable life. We know that those who have 
professed faith in the mission of the Prophet of God and who 
have become Muslims did so through the work of the Prophet of 
Islam. What they heard from him they also saw in his work and 
behavior. The reason some of the things we say are not heard and 
the people do not accept and believe them is that they do not 
see anything in practice. The fact that the remarks by the 
leader go so deeply into the public soul is because of the work 
and behavior of the vice-regent of the Muslims. Let us learn 
simple living from the exalted leader of the revolution and 
apply it. 
  In conclusion he said: We are in full agreement with sports 
facilities for women provided that religious law is fully 
observed. It is necessary in trips by women's teams and in 
planning athletic competition for women that religious criteria 
be carefully observed so that the problems surrounding women's 
sporting events last year in the Islamic nations will not be 
repeated. 
  I remind some of the newspapers to reconsider their 
unacceptable policies and dealings. Although during the Fourth 
Majles there have been several questions from the Majles and the 
relevant ministers, it is surprising and regrettable that one or 
two newspapers insulted in various ways the minister of the 
interior, this tormented figure who was imprisoned under the 
Pahlavi regime, on the pretext of a question that was asked by 
one of the deputies. 
  He also asked for help from the nation's banking system for 
the Ministry of Cooperatives. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
<H3>  Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving Medical 
Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public Service </H3>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report on the first consultation of the Councils 
Commission on the Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving 
Medical Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public 
Service, enacted in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], 
the general form of which was approved by the Majles. 
  In discussing this bill, the expert from the Councils 
Commission said: In Note 2, for those covered who are in need of 
diagnostic examinations, the expected cost must first be 
deposited in the government's account. In this note also, those 
in need who are covered by the Imam's aid committee are exempt. 
In the bill the government presented, individuals who are 
covered by the Health Care Organization and do not have the 
financial resources are also exempt. This bill was also approved 
by the Councils Commission. The approval of this bill is a gift 
to these dear ones as Oppressed Persons Week is about to begin 
(the birth anniversary of His Holiness Mehdi [may God hasten his 
joyful advent]). 
<H3>  Motion To Amend Article 8 of the Law on Independence of 
Attorney's Society </H3>
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Councils Commission concerning the Motion To 
Amend Article 8 of the Law on the Independence of the Judicial 
Attorney's Society, approved 9/5/1333 [26 November 1954], the 
general form of which was approved in the first consultation. 
  The Judicial Affairs Commission expert discussed this 
motion. 
He said: A requirement for doing judicial work in the judiciary 
is the existence of people who are strong and insightful in 
judicial affairs, are able to be aware of these legal 
formalities and can prosecute a claim along the legal path. 
Therefore the Attorney's Society took shape under the Law on the 
Independence of the Judicial Attorney's Society so that official 
attorneys would be used and it designated qualifications for 
those who must work as official judicial attorneys. 
  One of these qualifications is having a judicial law license 
from a reputable domestic or foreign university and also 
undergoing a one-year apprenticeship. Such a person can work as 
a first-class attorney. 
  In amending this law, they established privileges for a 
series of individuals who could not undergo the apprenticeship. 
One such person is the judicial judge, whether he has a law 
license or not. What is under discussion right now is in 
Paragraph 2 of this article, where deputies in the national 
Majles and the now dissolved senate who worked on the Judicial 
Affairs Commission and had the legal qualifications or had 
studied in the universities were allowed to obtain licenses to 
work as judicial attorneys after completing their Majles terms. 
  The proposal is that those who work on the Majles Judicial 
Affairs Commission and have a law license, qualifications in 
legal affairs or have studied in colleges and have been a member 
of the commission for four years be exempt from the one-year 
apprenticeship. 
<H5>  Motion To Prevent Air Pollution </H5>
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the first 
consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion 
To Prevent Air Pollution, the general form of which was approved 
by the deputies. 
  It is worth mentioning that as of Saturday of next week, the 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill will be studied 
by the deputies in three shifts. Under the new Majles Internal 
Guidelines, first the general form and the question of revenues 
will be presented, and then in the second consultation the 
details will be studied. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  Yesterday's Majles Ethics Lesson </H5>
  A praiseworthy measure in the Fourth Majles is the holding 
of 
ethics lessons for the deputies. Yesterday Ayatollah Hoseyn 
Nuri-Hamadani, a professor at Qom seminary, gave a talk and an 
interpretation of human responsibilities and the role of worship. 
  Ayatollah Nuri discussed worship and its varieties in Islam. 
He said one of the great forms of worship is alleviating 
financial needs and solving the problems of the people. He also 
said: The prophet said that whoever takes steps to meet the 
needs of a Muslim is like someone who spends his entire life 
worshipping God. 
  He advised the deputies to solve the problems of the people, 
and he invited them to observe piety, order in their work and 
life, praying all night and doing the evening prayer. 
  Continuing, Ayatollah Nuri enumerated the types of worship 
and said worship is the best way to get help from the 
magnificent Almighty. Continuing, he noted: The best worship is 
to reflect on theology and then to guide humanity, and after 
that comes meeting the needs and requirements of Muslims. 
  The professor from Qom Seminary said the evening prayer is 
the best way to come close to God. He mentioned obtaining energy 
from daily tasks, and for that he mentioned 20 beneficial things 
and needs of Muslims. 
  Continuing, he said: One must obtain help through worship in 
order to serve the people and put oneself on the path of 
humanity. The human being must obtain help from a great power in 
order to be able to carry out his responsibility. The Koran says 
this power and source is seeking help through patience and 
prayer. A human being must get energy from worship in order to 
be able to serve.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday and after approving the 
general form of the budget for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995], it continued in the morning, afternoon, and 
evening. At yesterday's Majles session, after approval of the 
general form of the bill, the Majles debated oil, tax, and 
allocated revenues, and a ceiling on foreign revenues of 
$10,154,300,000 was approved. We direct your attention to the 
detailed proceedings and legislation. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  After approving the general form of the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the Majles debated oil, tax, 
and allocated revenues for government organizations, and the 
recommendations from the deputies were studied. 
  The first revenue item was the ceiling on oil production and 
the price of oil, which was approved by the deputies. 
  Based on that legislation, the Ministry of Petroleum is 
required to issue a monthly report on crude oil production and 
sales and the revenues obtained until export earnings of 
$10,154,300,000 are achieved, along with projected oil exports 
and production by month for the remainder of the year. This 
report must be prepared by the 10th of each month and submitted 
to the Plan and Budget Organization, the Central Bank of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Economic and Financial 
Affairs, and the Majles Oil, Plan and Budget, Economic and 
Financial Affairs, Cooperatives and Foreign Policy Commissions. 
  It is worth mentioning that the rial[R] equivalent of the 
above foreign revenues is R17,651,988,000,000, and this is the 
ceiling proposed by the joint commission. 
  After the oil ceiling, the Majles made its decision about 
Note 2, and its means paragraphs were discussed and approved. 
  Paragraph Z - If authorized, the competent authorities in 
the 
government companies mentioned in Note 6 of Article 105 of the 
Direct Taxes Law may take the reserves given in Article 138 of 
the Direct Taxes Law approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February- 9 
March 1988] and its amendment for the stated profits for their 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] performance for use in paying 
unpaid taxes and the government's profit share up to the 
equivalent of the amounts stipulated in Part 3 of this law, and 
they may pay the funds to the Ministry of Economic and Financial 
Affairs. 
  Government companies are authorized to pay the funds given 
in 
Article 172 of the Direct Taxes Law approved in Esfand 1366 [20 
February-19 March 1988] and its amendment for the stated profits 
for their 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] performance first 
of all if the funds are payable in any case with the approval of 
the general assembly or the company's supreme council, as 
appropriate. 
  Second: This must not entail a reduction of the unpaid taxes 
and the government's profit share given in Part 3 of this law, 
and it is not to be used by the competent authorities in the 
aforementioned companies to obtain tax revenues for the 
nongovernment entities given in row 110,500 in Part 3 of this 
law. 
  They may set reserves given in Article 138 of the Direct 
Taxes Law approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February-19 March 1988] 
and its amendment at a figure in excess of 30 percent of the 
stated profits for the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 
performance of the relevant company. 
  The government is required to set commercial profits on 
goods 
imported into the country at a level that will achieve at least 
the amount of the revenues projected. 
<H5>  Banking Facilities Ceiling, Paragraph T </H5>
  The ceiling for banking facilities that can be issued by the 
nation's banking system to the government, private and 
cooperative sectors with regard to what is left at the end of 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] is authorized only to the 
extent that the change in their net debt to the banking system 
increases to R7,000 billion. The government is required to set 
the quota for each of the economic sectors in the framework of 
the aforementioned ceiling and this will be conveyed by the 
Central Bank to the national banking network, and 55 percent of 
the increase in the ceiling on banking facilities for the year 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] must be allocated exclusively 
to the private sector. 
<H5>  Paragraph Y </H5>
  To realize the tax revenues projected in Parts 3 and 8 of 
this law, the tax exemptions on the revenues for government 
companies given in the sections that pertain to them, with the 
exception of the exemptions given in the Direct Taxes Law 
approved in Esfand 1366 [20 February-19 March 1988] and its 
amendment pertaining to the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 
performance of these companies, are without effect. The order in 
this paragraph is not an impediment to implementing the order in 
Paragraph R of this note.

evening session. 
<H5>  Mr. Akrami's Proposal on Oil Products </H5>
  Concerning the import of oil products, Mr. Akrami, deputy 
from Semnan, proposed that this be prohibited in the year 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. Concerning his proposal, Akrami 
said: We now have a revenue problem due to the drop in oil 
prices. One revenue solution is to reduce our domestic 
consumption. Economy must begin with the government itself. One 
solution is substitution. That is, the Ministry of Petroleum 
should convert its passenger automobiles to burn natural gas. 
The other government organizations should voluntarily reduce 
their consumption of oil products, petroleum and gasoil, and 
this would also improve the environmental situation somewhat. 
  He then called for expansion of natural gas service in homes 
and the like. He said: This would automatically replace kerosene 
and the like. The minister of petroleum may say he has nothing 
to say against it but it is impossible, but the task of the 
Majles is to make policy and the government must implement it. 
  Continuing, he said: We must prepare a consumption model for 
the government itself to follow. Nothing will be solved merely 
by raising prices. 
  The government representative and the commission opposed Mr. 
Akrami's proposal. The government representative Mr. Aqazadeh 
said in opposition: This motion is not a policy, it is a 
decision. If it is a policy to say that we must economize, then 
we must find the way to do it. One way is rationing. According 
to previous experience, this does not work. It creates fuel 
shortages and a black market. 
  Then Mr. Akrami's proposal was put to a vote and was not 
approved. 
<H5>  Engineer Yahyavi's Proposal </H5>
  In the debate about oil revenues Engineer Yahyavi proposed 
an 
increase of 40,000 barrels per day [bpd] for oil products and 
said: In this regard I issued a guidelines memo to Mr. Ahmad 
Nateq-Nuri that what the Plan and Budget Commission did was in 
violation of the guidelines. Without the knowledge of the Oil 
Commission they deducted 40,000 barrels from the figure for 
domestic consumption and added it to the figure for exports to 
increase the revenue ceiling the Plan and Budget and Oil 
commissions had agreed to and which was to have been presented 
to the Majles. They thereby added about $190 million to the 
revenue ceiling. 
  He noted that the Ministry of Petroleum did not allow for 
increased consumption in the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] over the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. He said: 
If we reduce this ceiling by even 40,000 barrels, it will put 
pressure on the deprived class. Gasoline and gasoil have 
priority in oil product imports, and then if something is added 
it is spent on kerosene imports, meaning that if we subtract 
this 40,000 barrels it will come out of kerosene imports and 
this will again be pressure on the low-income classes. 
<H5>  Mr. 'Abdollahi's Proposal </H5>
  Speaking in opposition to Engineer Yahyavi's proposal, Mr. 
'Abdollahi said: The 13.8-foreign exchange figure the Majles 
approved for the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] has 
decreased to 12.4 for the year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995]. I wish we had accepted economic growth. In the Second 
Five-Year Plan we reduced basic goods to $695 million from the 
$1.35 billion figure in the First Five-Year Plan, due to the 
fact that energy growth is very great and is disproportionate to 
the growth in gross product. These are the instances we cite in 
saying that we must reduce reduce oil products and consumption. 
  Continuing, he said: Despite this, we increased our 
consumption figure from 1.34 million bpd to 1.5 million bpd, 
which is 12 percent growth. This rate of consumption is twice 
the world's per-capital consumption, three times the consumption 
in Turkey and so forth. Where will it go? 
  Concerning Note 25, 'Abdollahi said: If we had set prices 
justly and fairly five years ago we would be having better times 
now, and if we do not make a decision today we will bring the 
country up against more problems in the future. 
<H5>  Ahmad Nateq-Nuri's Proposal </H5>
  Speaking in agreement with Engineer Yahyavi's proposal, 
Ahmad 
Nateq-Nuri mentioned that import priority goes to gasoline after 
gasoil and then to kerosene. He said: It appears that social 
justice itself is the most oppressed thing of all. Anytime 
someone has a problem he says it is because of social justice. 
This is what we do. If you want to prevent consumption, first go 
and fix your ministry, reduce government consumption. First 
reduce the numbers of 6- and 8-cylinder automobiles in the 
ministries. 
  Continuing, Ahmad Nateq-Nuri discussed the shortage of fuel 
in various regions. he said: We are not opposed to reducing 
consumption, but begin the consumption model with yourself. He 
discussed the fact that the commission has thought in a onesided 
way, and has used its power everywhere. For the sake of the 
oppressed people, he asked the deputies to vote in favor of 
Engineer Yahyavi's proposal. 
  Then the expert from the relevant commission discussed 
Engineer Yahyavi's proposal. He said: The joint Plan and Budget 
and Economic and Financial Affairs commissions made this 
decision, not the Budget Commission, and it is unjust of the 
esteemed brothers to deal in this way with this commission. 
  The nation's production capacity is no more than this and we 
can produce no more than this. We must retain the reserved 
portion. We voted on liquid gas exports and we voted on the 
dollar unit for each barrel, and in general we arrived at the 
figure Engineer Yahyavi mentioned in his talk. He then discussed 
the issue of economy on the joint commission. He said: 
  Policies are like the policy to prevent waste and 
dissipation. We should import the same amount we set last year 
and save the 40,000 barrels, from which we will derive more 
revenue for other projects, and that is what is to be gained 
from these proposals. The figure of $190 million is deducted 
from revenues, of which the rial equivalent is R332 billion. 
That is, we must add add 33.3 billion tomans to these revenues 
before you, which are about 215 billion tomans. This means we 
must deduct more revenues from the country, and this proposal 
comes from the petroleum brothers. 
<H3>  Talks by the Minister of Petroleum and the Government's 
Representative </H3>
  The government representative mentioned the order of 
priorities of gasoline, gasoil, and then kerosene. He said: The 
nation's consumption is based on existing demand. The figure of 
190,000 barrels was approved and we have now imported 100,000 
more barrels of oil. Mr. Mirvalad is saying that we have done 
this on paper and moved the figures, but this did not occur in 
the projects in practice. If you reduce the figure this year, 
next year's exports will be reduced and will be used for 
domestic consumption unless you support the policy that we will 
distribute only this much and any shortfall will either be 
accepted or you will use rationing and ration coupons. 
  Continuing, he said: If the policy is one of no coupons and 
no regulations, it will be based on society's demand and we will 
not be able to do anything. 
  Continuing, he then said: If the price is not revised, 
200,000 barrels will not be enough and we will have to go to a 
ceiling of 300,000 barrels. The government wants to control the 
growth of consumption with the prices it has set. He also added: 
If we do not make a decision about prices, we will have to build 
a refinery every year. 
  Then the commission's proposal was put to a vote and it was 
not approved. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
  Yesterday during the debate and study of the budget bill 
RESALAT's correspondent spoke with Mr. Salehi, deputy from Izeh. 
He discussed the procedure for allocating budget credits to the 
nation's various provinces. He said: One problem the Majles must 
study and solve is the Plan and Budget Organization's failure to 
plan properly. This organization's officials must think with 
concern and in national terms and use study and care to identify 
various potentials in the farthest parts of the country. 
  He said: For example, it is noted that of the 17 heavy 
projects in one of the nation's infrastructure areas, seven were 
implemented in the province of Esfahan alone, and the other 10 
were implemented in the rest of the country. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Izeh said: A 700-bed hospital 
owned by the Social Security Organization was completed and 
began operating in less than two years in the province of 
Esfahan, while construction on a comparable hospital in 
Khuzestan began in the year 1354 [21 March 1975-20 March 1976] 
and is still 30 percent incomplete, even though the number of 
people served by the Social Security Organization in Khuzestan 
is greater. 
  Mr. Salehi also added: There is a city in the province of 
Khorasan, which has all resources and even an airport, but the 
other cities do not have such resources, because due to 
relationships based on personal taste, a large part of the 
nation's national resources are concentrated in one place. What 
answer do the Plan and Budget Organization's officials have for 
these problems? The Majles must exercise greater care in this 
regard and it must assess and control the numbers and figures 
for expenses in the years since the revolution. 
  In conclusion he said: Recently a bill came to the Power 
Commission seeking authorization to build a series of food 
industries 50 km from Esfahan. This created such a negative 
reaction among the deputies because of the unjust distribution 
of resources that it was unanimously rejected. This shows that 
enough care is not being exercised in distributing the budget.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. On 
the occasion of the beginning of the 16th anniversary of the 
triumph of the Islamic revolution and the arrival of the blessed 
Ten Days Dawn Celebration, five Majles deputies answered three 
questions from RESALAT. With thanks to Hojjat ol-Eslam Baghani, 
deputy from Sabzevar and chief of the Legislative and Judicial 
Affairs Commission, Dr. 'Abdkhoda'i, deputy from Mashhad and 
chief of the Culture and Higher Education Commission, Seyyed 
Reza Taqavi, deputy from Tehran and chief of the Guidance and 
Islamic Art Commission, Engineer Mohsen Yahyavi, deputy from 
Tehran and chief of the Oil Commission and Mohsen Kuhkan, deputy 
from Lanjan, we direct your attention to the questions and 
answers. 
<H5>  Three Questions From RESALAT to Majles Deputies </H5>
  1. What are the best gains of the revolution? 
  2. What are the shortcomings of the revolution? 
  3. What is the most important duty of the officials and the 
people to preserve and continue the revolution? 
<H5>  Answer From Mr. Taqavi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  Public participation in the affairs of the revolution is one 
of the important achievements of this revolution. 
  In answer to the first question he said: As the greatest 
event of the century, the Islamic revolution has affected the 
world in various ways. Today the international societies and 
world policy planners cannot ignore this great intellectual and 
revolutionary wave in their projects and decisions, because in 
the world's political geography the Islamic revolution of Iran 
has achieved its high position and no power has the ability to 
eliminate it. The world that opposes this revolution's 
aspirations has spared nothing in its enmity, its rancor, its 
brutality and its attempts to overthrow this change, from the 
economic embargo to domestic assassinations, the imposed war and 
other plots. One of the wonders of the Islamic revolution is 
that it has resisted proudly and has continued to make its way 
through these obstacles. 
  One of the Islamic revolution's most important successes is 
that it has been able to awaken the light of awareness and 
wakefulness in the hearts and minds of a great mass of the 
world's oppressed and deprived people. It has created an 
intellectual and cultural wave concerning the place of religion 
and religious practice. In a world of polytheism and lust, this 
is a great achievement this revolution has made. Today this 
revolution inspires religious crusading and struggle for the 
deprived people of Lebanon, the oppressed people of Palestine, 
the heros of Algeria and the upright people of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and they have risen to fight and wage religious war 
relying on this idea. It is not without reason that the 
imperialists and idolaters of our age are very afraid of this 
wave of awakening in the nations that adhere to Islam. [passage 
omitted discussing the accomplishments of the revolution in 
general terms] 
  1. A dangerous disease in the revolution is reactionary 
thought, which is besetting it like a plague; it will soon have 
the ability to convert any proud movement to silence or 
withdrawal. Reactionaries, with their deceptive and apparently 
concerned appearance, initially attract to themselves the naive 
and fearful, those with little substance and a superficial view, 
and they make them pessimistic about the changes of the 
revolution. They gradually make the people lose enthusiasm about 
the affairs of the revolution and bring the revolution up 
against problems. It appears to be a simple thing to deal with 
these people, who have a handsome exterior, because the Noble 
Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Two groups have broken my 
back, the reckless world and the ignorant recluse." 
  2. Another disease in the revolution is "extremist 
revisionism." This group, like the reactionaries, is also 
destructive. They distort the principles and fundamentals of the 
revolution with inappropriate and unacceptable analyses, and 
they draw the revolution into deviation by using the appeals of 
renewal and the inner tendency of human beings towards diversity. 
  3. Another disease in the revolution is that its aspirations 
and programs do not go beyond slogans and talk. To get more 
public support and to create conditions for its export, every 
revolution must get beyond slogans and into action as quickly as 
possible, and it must solve the problems of life to an 
acceptable extent. A revolution that is unable to correct 
malfunctions will not succeed. 
  An important mission for every revolution is to set models 
in 
various sectors. A good model is the best and most evocative 
evidence of a revolution's capability. The model is the precise 
action and physical manifestation of slogans and aspirations. 
Therefore, one of the important shortcomings of the slogan is 
the nonconformity of action to words. 
  1 [as published] - Another disease in the revolution is 
disputes and alienation among the revolutionary forces. 
Opportunists and flatterers benefit greatly wherever these 
disputes exist. They have gained a foothold for themselves 
inside the structure of the government by making use of the 
atmosphere of conflict, and they have made the revolution 
deviate with their explanations and justifications. 
<H3>  Mr. Taqavi Said in Answer to the Third Question [sentence as 
published] </H3>
  Officials must serve, and they must work sincerely and set 
their hearts on solving the problems of the people, and the 
people must also support the officials in view of the criteria 
mentioned. 
  The officials and the people must keep the revolution's 
deprived in mind in whatever they do, and they must act in the 
framework of guidance, aspirations, explanations and sacred 
ideals. 
  In the Islamic revolution this framework is the imamate and 
the concept of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult. The 
chief jurisconsult is a person who is fully qualified in terms 
of theological knowledge and whose actions are effective and 
just. The people and the officials must make the chief 
jurisconsult their standard for truth and falshood and justice 
and oppression, just as has been done so far, to guarantee the 
revolution's continuation. 
  Full public supervision of official activities will mean 
that 
work will be done on the straight path of the Islamic revolution 
and with greater soundness, and weakness and deviation will be 
reduced. Consequently positive effects such as growth in public 
confidence will occur, and following that, the desire and 
enthusiasm for support will reach a peak. 
  For the revolution to continue, the people and the officials 
must think beyond themselves and their personal and class 
interests. They must think of the revolution and its Islamic and 
human aspirations. They must put the needs of the revolution 
ahead of their own needs for the revolution to continue. 
<H5>  Answer From Dr. 'Abdkhoda'i, Deputy From Mashhad </H5>
  The more our country leans toward consumerism, the more 
dependent it will be, and with dependence the foundations of the 
revolution are shaken. 
  In answer to the first question, Dr. 'Abd Khoda'i said: 
  The Islamic revolution was a bright star shining on the 
world's dark horizon. It made Muslims aware of their Islamic 
essence. This must be considered the revolution's most important 
achievement. Before the triumph of the Islamic revolution the 
world was ruled by the Eastern and Western blocs. They made 
plans in any way they wished for the weak people and the Third 
World. One billion Muslims had no identity. The leaders of the 
Islamic nations were dependent on the West or on the East, and 
what was not a factor in the world of politics was Islam and its 
aspirations. 
  With the emergence of the Islamic revolution, the people 
understood their orthodox authenticity. The Muslim people of 
Algeria, who had been put down by hand-picked imperialist 
agents, proved to the world that love for Islam burns in the 
depths of their souls. Although the brave Muslims of Egypt are 
in prison, instead of "glory to the Arabs" the cry "glory to 
God, his prophet and to the believers" is ringing in their 
hearts. Although the Muslim people of Bosnia spend the dark 
nights under savage Serb bombardment, the heartening cry of 
"there is not god but God" rises to the sky from their minarets. 
In short, a great many of the world's Muslims have returned to 
themselves and have understood their Islamic essence. This in 
itself is the beginning of a great world change with regard to 
Islam. Today many intellectuals admit that Islam is the source 
of the greatest world changes, a change that fills the hearts of 
the world's deprived people and has shaken world imperialism. 
  Before the triumph of the Islamic revolution in our country, 
a few educated people under the influence of Marx and Mao said 
that their ideas were liberating and progressive, and some 
people also thought progress and advancement in the country 
depended on putting religion and religious practice aside and 
traveling the road taken by the Western nations. Before the 
revolution art, television and movies portrayed the ugliest 
films. There were shameful images on the streets of Tehran and 
many other cities that modesty of expression and writing would 
never have permitted. In a nation whose foundation was Islam and 
Shi'ism, millions of people were disgusted, and their disgust 
was imprisoned in their breasts. 
  The greatest fruit of the revolution was that it made the 
world of Islam and the Muslims aware of their Islamic identity. 
Although we have not yet fully achieved Islamic goals, we have 
found salvation from the failed situation of the past. 
  He said another achievement of the Islamic revolution was 
political independence. He said: Our country was under the 
domination of foreign governments for years. Since the time of 
the Qajars our country was the center of attacks and invasions 
by Russia and the English, so that at the time the interests of 
England and America were achieved, the most humiliating things 
were imposed on our nation such as the capitulation, but in the 
Islamic Republic the officials have risen from among the nation 
and are not dominated by foreigners. 
  Inside the monarchy most officials spent the evenings at 
fancy gatherings, but in the Islamic Republic a group of 
officials spends the evenings in prayer. At that time officials 
went to work with their thinking clouded by the effects of 
alcohol, but in the Islamic Republic of Iran they think for the 
people with the Imam's ideas taken from the Koran and the Nahj 
ol-Balagheh. 
  Our dear people must realize that our three government 
powers 
make their decisions independently and there is no type of 
foreign dominion over them. This is the greatest source of pride. 
  In this connection a point that must be noted is the role of 
the position of the vice-regency of the chief jurisconsult and 
the leadership. In recent years as changes have occurred with 
our neighbor to the north, meaning the Soviet Union, they have 
suffered impotence-causing domestic wars because of not having 
proper leadership, and there have been continuous problems for 
them. 
  The people must never forget the role of orthodox faith and 
leadership. Our nation, taking inspiration from the exalted 
orthodoxy of Islam and the principle of the vice-regency of the 
chief jurisconsult, has overcome the difficult conditions of the 
period of the revolution and is now moving with political 
stability and national harmony along the path of reconstruction. 
  One of the blessed effects of the Islamic revolution is the 
nation's growth and development. The valuable services the 
Islamic Republic gives to the deprived and remote areas cannot 
be compared to what was happening before the revolution. Before 
the revolution there were 160,000 university students. Today 
this number has risen to 900,000. The literacy crusade has had 
outstanding success in making many people literate who could not 
read or write. Before the triumph of the revolution Muslim women 
had to see male physicians for simple surgery and to give birth, 
but the number of female physicians has now increased 
significantly. The infant mortality rate has dropped 
significantly since the time before the revolution, in such a 
way that Iran has been praised by the WHO. 
  In the years after the triumph of the revolution thousands 
of 
kilometers of rural roads and several thousand schools and 
health clinics were built throughout the country, and thousands 
of villages were afforded the blessings of electrical power and 
healthy drinking water. Although the country was caught up in 
the imposed war for eight years, overall it has had outstanding 
growth and tens of thousands of development, industrial and 
service projects have been created in the country. 
  Of course, the people must take note of the basic point that 
under the regime of the idolaters world conditions for buying 
oil were better than they are today, and every barrel of oil 
sold for $36, in some years oil revenues were more than $24 
billion and the nation's population was about 30 million. In 
recent years, however, the price of oil has gone as low as about 
$10 and the nation's population has reached about 60 million. 
  In the past, however, except in a few cases infrastructure 
work was not done. Even though the country was sitting on a sea 
of oil and gas, petrochemical products were imported. Those 
affiliated with the royal court plundered the nation's revenues 
and put it in their accounts outside the country. They made 
thousands of home and real estate purchases abroad and spent the 
money on their own entertainment. Today, however, with less 
revenue than was available at that time and despite the losses 
caused by the war, the nation is moving in the direction of 
reconstruction and self-sufficiency. Of course, I am not denying 
the existence of problems in the country. We have problems with 
education, the economy and inflation. 
  The deputy from Mashhad then said in answer to the second 
question: One of the diseases of the revolution is the 
weakening of the aspirations of the revolution. If we are 
indifferent to the aspirations of Islam, it will be the greatest 
affliction for the revolution. The problem of the cultural 
invasion that is being imposed on the country by foreigners is 
one of the revolution's most important afflictions, which is 
sometimes direct and sometimes indirect. This can take the form 
of films, videotapes, or propaganda in the area of ostentation 
and consumerism. The more our country leans toward consumerism, 
the more dependent it will be, and with dependence the 
foundations of the revolution are shaken. At the present time 
our country has political independence. We must therefore strive 
to achieve economic independence as well. We will be independent 
economically when we decrease consumption and increase 
production. 
  One problem that could afflict the revolution is high prices 
and inflation, especially in the area of public needs. If the 
people see that they are having a hard time managing their 
lives, they may become indifferent. The greatest task before the 
government and the Majles is to anchor inflation. In this regard 
attention must be given to the differences between incomes. If 
the income gap becomes too great, some people will be engulfed 
in materialism and others were be under such severe pressure 
that life will be like a dark night for them. 
  Continuing, Dr. 'Abdkhoda'i mentioned dependence on the 
outside world and borrowing as other problems for the revolution. 
  He also answered the third question as follows: One must 
note 
initially that the people and the officials in the Islamic 
Republic are brothers, and the officials have come from the 
people. The commander of the faithful (peace be upon him) gave 
important commands in his 216th sermon concerning relations 
between the people and the officials. 
  In this sermon His Holiness said: The condition of a nation 
will not be good unless it has good leaders, and the leaders 
cannot do good work unless the people are firm and steadfast. 
  In the first place those running the country must be sound 
and they must feel that they are indebted to the people. They 
are responsible before the blood of thousands of martyrs who 
gave their lives during the revolution. Most important of all, 
we are responsible to a glorious Shi'ite history, which has 
always suffered throughout 14 centuries but has never given up 
its high goals. In the Islamic Republic time must not be a 
consideration for officials. They must serve the people to the 
best of their ability. On the other hand the people must also 
have a sense of responsibility. They must realize the conditions 
we are in and realize that we are in a situation where world 
imperialism is united against Islam, religion, orthodoxy, and 
our high Islamic aspirations and it creates a new problem for us 
every day. In such a situation each person in the country must 
look for ways to serve the government. 
<H5>  Answer From Mr. Yahyavi, Deputy From Tehran </H5>
  Seeking welfare, consumerism, and lack of concern for 
cultural work along with the economic work is one of the 
afflictions besetting the revolution. 
  He said in answer to the first question: One of the very 
important effects and great achievements of the Islamic 
revolution is its revelation of the unknown talents of the 
people. Taking inspiration from the life-giving commands of 
Islam, following the leadership of His Holiness Imam Khomeyni 
and giving up life and property, the Muslim nation of Iran 
brought the heavily armed idolater regime to its knees and 
established the Islamic Republic. With confidence in the life 
the Islamic Republic created among the Muslims of the world, the 
people of Algeria and south Lebanon found the courage to fight 
their enemies. I remember that during the pilgrimage to Mecca 
when I met with African Muslims they said that our revolution 
gave them heart, and the inclination towards Christianity became 
an inclination towards Islam after the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution in Iran. 
  One of the valued achievements of the Islamic revolution was 
dealing with the deprived class and the nation's remote rural 
areas. There were 10 times more rural roads created than were 
created in the time before the revolution, and many services 
have been rendered in the construction of classrooms and health 
clinics. 
  About five times as much university classroom space has been 
built as existed in the past, and we cannot stop developing 
classroom space as long as there is one student waiting to take 
the entrance examination. 
  Concerning the second question, the deputy from Tehran 
noted: 
The greatest affliction threatening the revolution is seeking 
welfare, consumerism, and lack of concern for cultural work 
along with the economic work. Up until now, because of being 
preoccupied with economic activities and the nation's 
infrastructure, we have not done the kind of cultural work that 
should be done. We have not succeeded in teaching religious 
beliefs to the young generation in the way that is appropriate, 
and this cultural weakness could make the enemy successful with 
the cultural invasion. If the officials make more effort to do 
cultural work, the cultural invasion will have no effect. If the 
inner faith of individuals is not reinforced, the goals of the 
enemy's cultural invasion will certainly be achieved. 
  Another affliction threatening the revolution is the seeking 
of welfare and the great inclination towards consumerism. 
Currently the prevailing attitude is to seek easy incomes 
without effort. If someone wants to perform his responsibility 
in society properly, his income should play some role in 
production, and he should not be thinking about getting more 
privileges. 
  In answer to the final question, Engineer Yahyavi said: The 
people have the responsibility to take part in various public 
affairs with political awareness and vigilance. The people must 
have political awareness in various sectors, from the university 
to the workplace. They must be able to analyze the issues and 
problems, and in my view an individual should have full 
understanding of the world in which he lives. He must be 
familiar with the various fronts and make decisions. In that way 
he will be able to take proper positions. A person should not 
prevent the people from becoming familiar with political 
affairs. If people have political awareness, they certainly will 
not be fooled by the enemy. Another responsibility of the people 
is to supervise the issues properly and to make constructive 
criticism. No official is exempt from constructive criticism. 
All must accept criticism to correct their work. All people and 
officials on all sides must try to perform their 
responsibilities properly to please God. 
  The responsibility of the officials to preserve the 
revolution is heavier than that of the people, and they must not 
put personal and occupational interests ahead of the interests 
of the people. Our people have done their duty in the best way 
to create and maintain the revolution, and now it is the 
responsibility of the officials to make every effort to serve 
these people. 
  It is the duty of officials to assign responsibilities to 
worthy people by identifying worthy elements, and to apply 
encouragement and punishment in the work in the assessment of 
performance. It is also the duty of officials to be a force for 
unity and harmony among the people, and they must avoid creating 
any kind of separation or alienation. They must use knowledge 
and other resources with proper management to compensate for the 
sacrifices of the people. 
<H5>  Answer From Mr. Baghani, Deputy From Sabzevar </H5>
  One of the things afflicting the revolution is discord, and 
if discord is created in the nation, the existence of the 
revolution will be endangered. 
  Mr 'Ali Asghar Baghani, deputy from Sabzevar, said in answer 
to RESALAT's first question: The most important achievement of 
the Islamic revolution is stabilizing the government of the 
Islamic Republic, because at the beginning of the triumph of the 
Islamic revolution problems were created in various ways for the 
Islamic government by minigroups, liberals and people seeking 
power. [passage omitted on the accomplishments of the revolution 
in general terms] 
<H5>  Answer From Mr. Kuhkan, Deputy From Lanjan </H5>
  One of the revolution's most important achievements is 
putting the nation on the path of God and achieving political 
independence. 
  Mr. Mohsen Kuhkan, deputy from Lanjan, said in answer to the 
first question: The Islamic revolution's most important 
achievement for the Muslim nation of Iran is putting it on the 
path of God, because before the revolution the idolatrous 
government ruled every dimension of life and called upon the 
people to enjoin evil and prohibit good. Today the government 
has formed and is advancing based on enjoining good and 
prohibiting evil. 
  Another of the revolution's achievements is political 
independence. Today we can claim that we are the world's most 
independent nation in terms of political independence. Another 
of the revolution's successes is that despite all the problems 
such as the economic embargo, the imposed war, and the damage 
caused by natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, it 
is using the nation's economic resources for development and 
prosperity and to provide the minimum services need by the 
nation's cities and rural areas. [passages omitted on the 
accomplishments of the revolution]

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Claude Lorieux </F>
in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Lorieux] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
telephoned you on 8 March evening. Why? 
  ['Arafat] To discuss the message which I had sent him 
through his special envoy Jacques Neriya whom I received in 
Cairo on Monday. I reaffirmed the measures which need to be 
taken to ensure the Palestinian people's security and 
tranquility in the Israeli-occupied territories. 
  [Lorieux] In other words, you are putting forward 
preconditions for the resumption of the peace negotiations.... 
  ['Arafat] We are not talking about preconditions but about 
the precise implementation of the agreement reached on 13 
September in Washington by the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
Take the Jewish settlements within the city of Hebron. They 
are illegal. Moreover, eight ministers of the Rabin government 
are asking that their occupants be removed. I am not asking for 
them to be destroyed, but moved. 
  [Lorieux] Why are these settlements situated in the heart of 
the city more illegal than Qiryat Arb'a, which is growing up 
outside the gates of Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] The 13 September agreement makes provision for the 
issue of Jewish settlements (Qiryat Arba', for instance) to be 
discussed later. The text states: "As soon as possible and no 
later than the beginning of the third year" following the 
agreement. "As soon as possible" because we think, like the 
Israelis, that it is a burning issue. But, can you understand 
it? Although Qiryat Arba' is three-fourths empty, why on earth 
are the settlers coming and installing themselves in the city? 
Why are they coming and confiscating Palestinian houses? 
  [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin? 
  ['Arafat] Our reference is the Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington on 13 September. There can only be one 
authority: Israeli today and Palestinian when we are in Gaza and 
Jericho. The Israeli Army is therefore responsible for the 
security of the settlers. However, the settlers have become 
another power. A separate, armed, and dangerous power. 
  [Lorieux] That is your analysis. But I repeat my question: 
Did you convince the Israeli prime minister on Tuesday evening? 
  ['Arafat] No. It was a discussion. He gave his viewpoint, 
I gave mine. I spoke in particular about the establishment of 
an international presence in the occupied territories. The 
Declaration of Principles mentions this possibility. It is very 
important that this international presence should be rapidly 
established to ensure the protection of our people. We are not 
making new demands. We are just asking for the Declaration of 
Principles to be honestly implemented. Throughout the seven 
months of negotiations which have followed the Washington 
agreements, the Israelis have insisted on one issue: the 
security of the settlers. However, it seems that the Jewish 
settlements are time bombs. This is particularly glaring 
because those responsible for the Hebron tragedy are not only 
settlers but some units of the Israeli Army. The Israeli Army 
opened fire to protect the retreat of the Israeli settlers and, 
as we have since learned, it also opened fire on the faithful 
who were trying to flee the mosque. Outside, facing the 
entrance, soldiers killed eight people and wounded 24. The 
Israeli commission of inquiry itself admits that there was 
negligence. How is this possible? That mosque is under the 
sole protection of the Israeli Army. 
  [Lorieux] It is constantly being announced that the UN 
Security Council will adopt a resolution on the 25 February 
massacre. This text should not only condemn the killing but 
also define the measures to be taken to prevent new incidents. 
  ['Arafat] We hope that the U.S. representative will vote in 
favor of it. But 13 days have already passed. You can imagine 
what that means: 13 days after that horrible massacre. And, as 
I speak to you, nothing has yet been done. 
  [Lorieux] Is the Security Council's inability to act the 
only obstacle to the resumption of the negotiations interrupted 
after the massacre? 
  ['Arafat] It is one of the obstacles. Let us not forget 
that many UN resolutions have remained a dead letter. We are 
determined to ensure that the ones adopted on Hebron are 
actually implemented. 
  [Lorieux] You are likely to have to wait for the 
completion of negotiations not only on the principle but on the 
methods of establishing an international presence in the 
occupied territories. The organization, composition, and 
deployment of that presence will have to be defined... 
  ['Arafat] Let us make things clear. I want to be sure that 
the Security Council's decision will change the situation on the 
ground. It is my right to demand it. It is also the right of 
my people who want to see the situation changing in practice. 
They have been waiting for seven months. 
  [Lorieux] When you talk of an international presence, are 
you thinking of an armed presence? 
  ['Arafat] Allow me to ask you a question. Who will protect 
this international force? The armed Jewish settlers? 
  [Lorieux] You mean that the members of this force will have 
to ensure their own protection... 
  ['Arafat] Yes. It is for them to protect themselves. I am 
not asking them to have tanks. I am simply asking that they do 
not constitute an additional responsibility for we Palestinians. 
They will have to be active and play their role. 
  [Lorieux] Where should they be deployed? In Gaza-Jericho 
which is due to come under Palestinian authority on 13 April? 
Or in the whole of the West Bank, which is to remain under 
Israeli occupation until the election of the "Palestinian 
authority" in July? 
  ['Arafat] The first group should go to Hebron to provide the 
Palestinian population with the protection decided by the 
Security Council. This is urgent. We must be aware of our 
people's anger, and that of the Arab people, the Muslim people, 
the Christian people in the world, the international community. 
I have even received messages of condolence signed by Jewish 
organizations. 
  [Lorieux] A consensus had still not been found in the UN 
Security Council 13 days after Hebron. Particularly because the 
Americans are refusing to allow the Council's resolution to be 
applied to the occupied territories "including Jerusalem?" Do 
you know why? 
  ['Arafat] Ask the Americans! The Security Council is not 
working on a draft resolution presented by the Palestinians, the 
Arabs, or the nonaligned countries, but on a text presented by 
the U.S. Administration. This U.S. text refers to resolution 
799 which relates to the fourth Geneva convention which is 
applicable to all the occupied territories "including 
Jerusalem." The Americans' refusal conflicts with their initial 
position. 
  [Lorieux] Is it therefore a change of attitude by 
Washington? 
  ['Arafat] That is what it seems to be. 
  [Lorieux] Bill Clinton came to the presidency with the most 
pro-Israeli team that the White House had seen for a long time. 
The President, on contact with the real situation, seemed to 
change. But, since the Hebron massacre, do you think that the 
U.S. attitude has taken a step backward? 
  ['Arafat] We will have to wait and see. This massacre is a 
turning-point. Like the Sarajevo market massacre. The Hebron 
massacre was planned and organized by Israeli Army units and by 
armed settlers. It is something like the Secret Army 
Organization -- illegal organization supporting French rule of 
Algeria formed during Algerian war. We must therefore wait 
until the whole U.S. reaction is revealed at all levels and not 
just in the Security Council. We will have to gauge their 
participation in the international force. We are not asking for 
the moon. We are asking for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles of 13 September which makes provision 
for an international presence. Will the United States be up to 
the responsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing 
of this Declaration of Principles at the White House? That is 
the whole question. 
  [Lorieux] Russia thinks that the Hebron shooting has 
"completely scuttled the negotiation process." It has therefore 
just proposed the "convening of a second Madrid conference." 
What do you think of this idea? 
  ['Arafat] It is a good idea. 
  [Lorieux] Is the process launched in Madrid in October 1991 
so bogged down that something else should be tried? 
  ['Arafat] No, it should be freshened up and reactivated. 
  [Lorieux] When you received me in October before your visit 
to France, you told me: "If Rabin makes a promise, he keeps his 
word." Can you confirm your judgment today? 
  ['Arafat] I stick to the situation and the facts. Our 
people are waiting for the decisions to be implemented in the 
field. Slogans are not enough. 
  [Lorieux] Some Palestinians burned your picture in refugee 
camps in Jordan and Lebanon. What is your reaction? 
  ['Arafat] These autos-da-fe are the work of secret services. 
I know who is behind them. I do not have the impression that 
the Palestinians are angry with me. 
  [Lorieux] Over the months, and especially since Hebron, you 
have come under growing criticism. Even within the PLO.... 
  ['Arafat] My comrades have the right to criticize me. It is 
their right to ask me to listen to them more. Seven months 
after the 13 September agreement, nothing has changed in the 
daily lives of the Palestinians in the territories. 
  [Lorieux] Have you convinced Mr. Rabin and Mr. Clinton that 
it is necessary to go into action, as you put it? 
  ['Arafat] I hope so. Otherwise, the scenario changes. 
Peace is not just something the Palestinians need. The 
Israelis, Americans, and Europeans need it, too. If this 
agreement is not implemented, the Near East will enter into a 
period of confusion and Balkanization. 
  [Lorieux] The Israelis are in less of a hurry than you. 
That was obvious during your last meeting with Mr. Peres in 
Cairo a month ago. 
  ['Arafat] In Cairo, I was very accommodating. I wanted to 
give the peace process a last chance. But I stress that it was 
a last chance. If the Declaration of Principles is not 
implemented precisely and honestly, I will be entitled to 
explain to my people how that came about. They are waiting for 
me to do so. I will not deceive my people. Its patience is 
limited. 
  [Lorieux] Have you set a deadline? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, 12 April is the deadline. It is the day 
fixed in the Declaration of Principles for the completion of the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. In one month's time! 
  [Lorieux] If that deadline is not honored, what will you do? 
Will you close shop? 
  ['Arafat] If nothing was done, that would mean that the 
Israeli Government had decided not to respect our agreements! 
It is not my responsibility which is at stake in this affair. 
It is the responsibility of the international community and, in 
particular, the U.S. and Russian joint sponsors of the peace 
process, particularly President Clinton. 
  [Lorieux] Last Sunday, the Palestinian Islamic 
fundamentalist movement Hamas issued an ultimatum to the Jewish 
settlers: Move before 15 March or watch out! Do you agree with 
that? 
  ['Arafat] You have to understand our people's despair. 
  [Lorieux] Some 20,000 Israelis demonstrated in Tel Aviv last 
Saturday against the Hebron massacre. 
  ['Arafat] By that they showed that a high proportion of 
Israeli society is against the settlers' crime, against the 
policy of settlements, and against the fanatical groups which 
are simply time bombs. This section of the population is 
opposed to any delay in the implementation of the 13 September 
Declaration of Principles. 
  [Lorieux] It is in this terribly tense climate that Francois 
Leotard is making a visit to Israel. He met with one of your 
aides in Paris last week. What is your view of the French 
defense minister's visit? 
  ['Arafat] I have no opinion to express on France's foreign 
policy. I just think that it would have been preferable to 
postpone that visit, especially since it is a visit by the 
defense minister and he will have discussions with the Israeli 
Army. This visit is likely to be seen by the Israelis, and 
especially by the fanatical groups, as a favorable signal.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH on 8 March publishes 
on pages 1 and 3 an approximately 4,000-word article by Chief 
Editor Mahfuz al-Ansari. The article describes a "dialogue" 
between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and several Egyptian 
Government and opposition figures, writers, journalists, and 
artists during a late-night Ramadan banquet hosted by Dr. Usamah 
al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of 
the President's Office for Political Affairs. The banquet is 
also attended by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 'Arafat, and 
a number of unnamed 'Arafat "aides." The date and place of the 
banquet is not given, but the writer notes that the al-Baz' 
banquet was preceded by an earlier banquet to break the fast 
hosted by President Mubarak, which suggests that the dialogue 
was held on 6 March. 
  The writer begins the article by giving background 
information on the Hebron massacre and 'Arafat's contacts with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He then notes that in times of crisis, 
'Arafat's mind is "clear" and that he acts in a cool manner. He 
then quotes some of 'Arafat's remarks during the dialogue. 
  'Arafat says: "I am not a man who lives in dreams. 
Undoubtedly, mean and violent incidents disturb me; they make 
me angry and outraged. But during a crisis, I always sit down 
and think with my mind, not my emotions. In a crisis, I am 
governed by my mind and the sense of responsibility wins me 
over. This is because I am required to make a decision and take 
a stand, a decision and a stand that will affect the destiny of 
a people and a homeland. Thus, I can never allow myself to make 
a decision with such magnitude and influence under the pressure 
of anger or the inspiration of emotions and outrage." 'Arafat 
then sheds light on his telephone conversation with Christopher. 
He says: "U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
telephoned me. After expressing his regrets and condemnation of 
the crime and after conveying President Clinton's condolences, 
he said: Could you send a high-level envoy to discuss all the 
details of the situation? I immediately answered: Yes. I will 
send Nabil Sha'th. This is despite the anger, the outrage, and 
the extreme grief. For I do not allow anger to govern politics. 
Anger does not make politics." 
  'Arafat is then asked by journalists Makram Muhammad Ahmad, 
Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, National Progressive Unionist Group 
leader Khalid Muhiy-al-Din, and Lawyers Association President 
Ahmad al-Khawajah about the results of Sha'th's mission in 
Washington. He says: "Our people are passing through the most 
difficult and complicated stage of their lives. Either they 
will win their struggle and battle or lose everything. Thus, 
for the thousandth time, there is no place for outrage and there 
is no room for a decision motivated or dictated by anger. Work 
to regain the land and rights must not stop. To be clear, 
Christopher was not the only one who contacted me after the 
massacre. Rabin did, too, and said a lot of things. I could 
have declined to take the call, and I had reasons to, but I did 
not. I told my colleagues in the occupied territories: Do not 
reject the contacts and do not stop the work, and it is going on 
day and night. The fact is that if the situation is viewed in a 
reasonable and sane way we will find that Israel, particularly 
after the massacre, is in a real predicament. It is trying to 
get out of the situation by all means--the extremists and the 
moderates, the political and governmental forces--although each 
party is trying to get out of it in its own way." 
  The writer then notes that 'Arafat explains the "political 
and technical details" of the Oslo agreement. 'Arafat discloses 
how Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, in one of his 
diplomatic missions in Tel Aviv, managed to "obtain Rabin's and 
Peres' approval to grant the East Jerusalem Palestinians the 
rights to run and vote in elections and that Rabin agreed to 
allocate two ballot boxes for the Jerusalem residents, one in 
front of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and another in front 
of the al-Aqsa Mosque." 
  The writer then notes that al-Baz is asked about Egyptian 
press reports calling for speeding up normalization with Israel. 
After noting that decisions on such issues as normalization are 
not made by the state, since it involves relations between 
peoples, al-Baz says: "The Egyptian state is linked to Israeli 
by a peace agreement. Egypt is loyal to its pledges and 
agreements. The magnitude of cooperation and dealings, which is 
known as normalization, is governed by practices and responses. 
It is not made by an administrative or political decision." He 
adds: "I believe that some writers have noticed that some Arab 
states, which are advocating the boycott and have discussed with 
us several joint projects, have hastened to announce various 
cooperation projects between themselves and Israel. I believe 
that some of our writers, in the hope of reaching a quick peace 
and a near solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, thought that 
everybody was rushing to gain the benefits of peace while Egypt 
remained faithful to its Arab principles and commitments to 
Palestine. This is the whole situation and there is nothing 
more to it. Common interests are too great to be made or 
motivated by decisions." 
  'Arafat is then pressed to disclose the U.S. position and 
the answers brought back from Washington by Nabil Sha'th. He 
says: "I disagree with Nabil. He is always optimistic and he 
says good things about the position of Christopher and the U.S. 
Administration. But at the same time, he brought us many U.S. 
reservations regarding the failure of the Security Council to 
issue a resolution, because of the Americans, following a 
horrible massacre. We did not ask the United States for 
anything new. We asked it to make a reference to what it had 
already agreed to in Security Council Resolution 799 on 
Jerusalem issued in 1992. The strange thing is that the United 
States, the sponsor of this resolution, refuses to mention it in 
the new resolution. It also does not want to announce anything 
before obtaining Israel's prior approval, particularly with 
respect to the international monitoring or the international 
troops. We do not want troops equipped with heavy weapons and 
tanks, we just want two platoons [fasilatyn]. And I have an 
approval from Russia, France, England, and Belgium for 
approximately 1,000 soldiers. This would be a multinational 
force, like the one in Sinai, armed with personal weapons to 
only undertake protection and monitoring. The sad thing is 
that, while we are waging this fierce and tough battle to 
maintain the momentum, preserve the rights, and regain the land, 
many come out and make the most horrendous accusations against 
us. For instance, they call Nabil a traitor and say that he 
surrendered, but the fact is that he is waging a tough battle of 
negotiations and defense." 'Arafat adds: "The agreement on the 
occupied territories is the beginning of the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. When I found hesitation from the United 
States because it was waiting for Rabin's approval of 
international troops in the occupied territories, I told them 
that the land is my land. The land is Palestinian and 
sovereignty is for the Palestinians. Those who have the right to 
approve or disapprove of the presence of troops on the land are 
the Palestinians, the PLO, and we accept it to protect our 
people. The agreement signed stipulates withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho on 12 April. In July we should start discussions 
about measures for the withdrawal of Israelis from the remaining 
area of the occupied territories. Thus, I say it loud and clear: 
I, and no one else, am the one who has a right to accept or 
reject the international troops." 
  'Arafat is then asked if he thinks the Israeli Government is 
involved in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 'Arafat says: 
"Frankly, the Zionist extremist and fanatical forces are still 
in control of the situation in Israel; in the Army, the 
government, and the institutions. It is true that the majority 
supported the agreement and stands strongly behind peace and a 
settlement, but the extremists still have a strong opinion and 
hidden tools that they could use at any time, like what happened 
in Hebron." 'Arafat adds: "Some say that the Army was behind 
the crime, and I believe this is not accurate. The fact is that 
some Army factions, not the entire Army, must have acted in 
collusion. I also refuse to believe that it was an individual 
act." 
  Asked if he could still control the Palestinians despite the 
tragedy, 'Arafat says: "I am confident about the awareness of 
the Palestinian people, their wisdom, and their sane and 
rational revolution that refrains from excesses. I am sure that 
meeting our legitimate and just demands, which must be 
stipulated in a Security Council resolution, could restore 
confidence to the Palestinians so that they can proceed toward 
regaining their rights. The Palestinians are tired of war and 
displacement and want stability and reconstruction, without 
surrendering or one-upmanship. But for Israel to maneuver or 
try to improve its image by minor resolutions, this will solve 
nothing. We have shown the entire world our goodwill in the 
saddest moment of the massacre and in the darkest hours of 
disappointment. If Israel responds, we will return to the 
negotiations on the basis of a just resolution by the Security 
Council on the condition that all the Arab parties--meaning 
Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan--will return to the negotiating 
table, too. We are in touch with them and I have called for a 
five-party meeting among Egypt, Palestine, Jordan, Syria, and 
Lebanon to coordinate our stances before any new step is taken." 
  Asked if this requires a meeting with Rabin, 'Arafat says: 
"I 
do not refuse to meet with Rabin, but shall we meet just to take 
a picture for the masses? I cannot accept this. But if the 
meeting is intended to adopt practical steps that could remedy 
the flaw of the old resolution and open the door for the new 
rounds, I believe that the awaited Security Council resolution 
could pave the way for such a meeting." 
  Asked if he still has pressure cards to negotiate from a 
strong position, 'Arafat says: "Of course, we still have cards 
in our hands. Who said peace is our only option? We say it 
clearly and simply: If you change your mind, we will. If you 
do not want peace, this is your choice and we are ready with all 
means. We have shown the world our intentions and the world has 
seen the crime. On this occasion, I would like to say that this 
is not the time for ending the Arab boycott, particularly after 
what happened in Hebron, which could be repeated by the Zionist 
extremists. I repeat once again that the Palestinians are 
intelligent and cultured. They want to get rid of the 
occupation, but at the same time they can endure a great deal. 
They can endure appalling crimes, such as the Hebron massacre 
and others, if this is the price for its freedom." 
  Asked if the Palestinian extremist current will engage in 
one-upmanship against him, particularly now, 'Arafat said: 
"Unfortunately, this current is violent against their fellow 
Palestinians, not the Israelis. We refused the proposal that 
PLO and Fatah supporters be freed from Israeli prisons and 
insisted that Israel release everybody without exception. As a 
result, our cadres are still in prison, while the Islamic 
current negotiated the release of its cadres alone in a separate 
agreement with the Israeli authorities."

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Brigitte </F>
Voykowitsch and Artur K. Vogel in Tunis on 8 March: "I Will 
Plant Roses in My Garden"] 
  [Text] It is one o'clock in the morning in Tunis. Yasir 
'Arafat -- in uniform, handgun in a green holster -- sits behind 
his desk under a picture of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem 
and signs documents. "Yesterday I started this felt-tip pen," 
he says. "Today it is already used up." 
  [DER STANDARD] What about your gun? Have you had to use it? 
  ['Arafat] I have had to use it often. In 1973, the Israelis 
attacked me in Beirut and, at the same time, my three brothers 
in Jordan. Only my bodyguards were there -- six of them, then I 
myself, and my secretary. We opened fire, all of us, until we 
escaped. I tell you just one of the many incidents. 
  [DER STANDARD] Therefore, they call you the great survivor? 
  ['Arafat] I have a strong belief in God. In Islam we say: 
The moment has not yet come. And when it comes, no one will be 
able to stop it. This is predestination. But who understands 
why God has made my problems even greater now? 
  [DER STANDARD] Would you sometimes prefer to be somebody 
else than the president of Palestine? 
  ['Arafat] No, this is my destiny, and I have accepted it. I 
was a successful engineer and entrepreneur, but then I joined 
the revolution and left everything behind. I do not regret it. 
  [DER STANDARD] Where do you get your energy from? 
  ['Arafat] For me, work is the best way to relax. I am a 
workaholic. I cannot remember having had one day of vacation 
ever since I joined the revolution. 
  [DER STANDARD] You never take a break? 
  ['Arafat] Sometimes I would like to watch cartoons. But I 
do not have time, I just watch the news on television. 
  [DER STANDARD] Since the massacre on 25 February in Hebron 
things have been terrible, but we assume that everything works 
according to plan between Israel and the PLO: What is your 
vision of the future state of Palestine? 
  ['Arafat] I have called it the "peace of the brave." This 
means: Completely new relations with one's enemies. We want 
the same peace as that between Egypt and Israel. 
  [DER STANDARD] Would the Palestinian state be a democracy 
like Austria? 
  ['Arafat] We Palestinians are proud of our democracy; we 
call it a democracy in the jungle of the guns. But it is one of 
the most important models of a democracy in this region. 
  [DER STANDARD] Democracy harbors a risk: The people could 
elect somebody else. Would you be willing to retire? 
  ['Arafat] I would love to. 
  [DER STANDARD] What would you do then? 
  ['Arafat] I am an engineer and I like my job. 
  [DER STANDARD] Could you imagine leading a normal, civilian 
life, having a house in Jericho, a garden.... 
  ['Arafat] Why in Jericho? 
  [DER STANDARD] ...or Jerusalem, Nablus, Gaza? 
  ['Arafat] Why not? 
  [DER STANDARD] You would plant roses in your garden? 
  ['Arafat] Sooner or later I will have something like that. 
  [DER STANDARD] Are you looking forward to that? 
  ['Arafat] Yes. I have a right to that. This is a 
democracy, and we will accept what is decided in the democracy. 
However, I am not alone; I am also the chairman of the Fatah 
Movement. 
  [DER STANDARD] And now you are also a married man. 
  ['Arafat] That has not changed anything about my situation. 
Otherwise, I would not be here for this interview. 
  [DER STANDARD] Are we now (it is almost two o'clock in the 
morning) keeping you away from your wife? 
  ['Arafat] No, I still have another two hours of work. 
  [DER STANDARD] The idyllic times in Gaza with roses in the 
garden have not come yet. We can imagine that Fatah people from 
Hebron call you and say: "Abu 'Ammar, our people are outraged; 
they want to avenge themselves for what happened in the mosque." 
What is your advice to them? 
  ['Arafat] After the massacre, the people are extremely 
angry. This could not have happened with the participation of 
the (Israeli) Army. And today (Tuesday) the Israeli 
investigation committee noted that the Army shares 
responsibility because the guards came too late. What does that 
mean: The guards came too late? Where were those who were on 
duty before? This means that some units, generals, or officers 
of the Army conspired with the armed settlers. And since we are 
talking of the massacre of Hebron: Since then we have had 
another massacre; 37 people were killed, more than 400 injured, 
and more than 2,000 arrested. 
  [DER STANDARD] Is it not surprising that the Palestinians 
have not yet decided to resume their armed struggle? 
  ['Arafat] They have been patient so far, but that has 
limits. 
  [DER STANDARD] Can you imagine a situation in which you say: 
We must interrupt the peace process? 
  ['Arafat] I have never deceived my people. If we reach a 
dead end, I will tell my people. 
  [DER STANDARD] But a dead end does not mean an interruption 
of the peace process? 
  ['Arafat] Who knows, it takes two to tango. 
  [DER STANDARD] Sometimes tragic events can have positive 
effects, such as the grenade attack on the market in Sarajevo. 
Do you think something like that is possible in connection with 
the massacre in Hebron? 
  ['Arafat] After Sarajevo, the Americans seized the 
initiative. But here they are not doing anything. Quite the 
opposite, they are even preventing the UN Security Council from 
adopting a resolution. The other members of the Council would be 
for it. 
  [DER STANDARD] At the end of September, the first pictures 
of your potential future residence in Jericho turned up.... 
  ['Arafat] Do you know how many houses I have been given? 
Fifty-eight. I expressed thanks for them and said: I need only 
one -- perhaps. 
  [DER STANDARD] Have you chosen one? 
  ['Arafat] No, no. 
  [DER STANDARD] When will you need a house in Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] After what has happened, it is very difficult to 
give a date. 
  [DER STANDARD] Has the peace process not reached a point 
where both Rabin and you would suffer political damage if it 
collapsed? 
  ['Arafat] Yes, but the Israelis are the occupation power. 
It is important that the Israelis realize that they cannot 
survive or coexist with force. Where is the Soviet Union today, 
formerly the biggest nuclear power in the world?

  [Text] Head of the PLO Political Department Faruq Qaddumi 
affirmed in an interview with London MBC Television this evening 
that the U.S. Administration is putting intense pressure on the 
PLO to force it to return to the negotiating table. He 
described the Russian initiative to hold a new international 
conference as worthy of consideration. 
  Qaddumi said the PLO made many concessions to the U.S. 
Administration after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre to 
encourage the United States to approve a draft resolution 
condemning Israel. But Clinton's administration rejected the 
draft, threatening to veto it. We asked Qaddumi first about the 
PLO reaction to the U.S. lack of neutrality: 
  [Begin recording] [Qaddumi] We were surprised to see the 
United States postponing this draft resolution. Mr. Dennis Ross 
contacted us to say that it was necessary to hold negotiations 
with Peres or one of the brothers and that if we agreed to these 
negotiations they would approve the draft resolution. We 
refused. Mr. Ross contacted us again to threaten that the United 
States would veto the resolution. We said: If, as a major 
state responsible for peace and security in the region, you want 
to tamper with peace then this is your own business, but we 
cannot drop Jerusalem from that draft. Therefore, Jerusalem 
will stay. We have to see practical measures, not only a 
decision to approve this draft; we have to see action taken to 
reassure our people that some measures have been taken, either 
by the United Nations or the conference sponsors. 
  [Qabalan] What is your reaction to the Russian suggestion to 
hold an international conference similar to the Madrid summit, 
and what are the prospects for success? 
  [Qaddumi] In fact, I believe that the Russian suggestion is 
worthy of consideration. There must be an international 
conference to assess what was achieved in the past; to determine 
who disturbs the climate of peace, who commits acts that violate 
the stipulations of the agreement completely, who obstructs this 
agreement, who fails to show commitment to the agreement, who 
deports and kills the citizens, who spoils everything, and who 
is the cause of all that tension. It is Israel. Who is backing 
Israel? It is the United States of America. 
  It is necessary to make an international assessment of this 
march so that we can determine who is responsible for 
obstructing this peaceful march. It is Israel, with U.S. 
backing. [end recording]

  [Text] Tunis, 10 Mar (MENA)--The Tunisian paper AL-RA'Y 
AL-'AMM today cited informed Palestinian sources as saying that 
a meeting was held at the Palestinian Orient House Hotel in East 
Jerusalem, in which all PLO groups took part with the exception 
of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The sources noted that 
the meeting was held to reorganize relations between these 
groups in light of current developments in the wake of the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. 
  The sources added that an agreement was reached at this 
meeting, which was chaired by Faysal al-Husayni as the head of 
the Fatah Movement in the West Bank, that stipulated the revival 
of the Unified National Leadership of the Intifadah. They said 
that agreement was also reached on reformulating national unity 
on the basis of the struggle [against the Israeli occupation] 
and within the framework of firm Palestinian principles. 
  They also noted that collective action will be taken to 
support the PLO command's suspension of the peace process in 
protest of the Hebron massacre and linkage of the resumption of 
negotiations to the drawing up of new rules and bases that will 
ensure the removal of the existing settlements in the occupied 
territories. 
  The Palestinian sources expressed their belief that the 
Palestinian groups' representatives might soon reach an 
agreement, according to which the Population Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine will return to the PLO establishments 
and leadership bodies.

  [Text] Amman--A significant number of members of the 
Palestine National Council (PNC) and Palestine Central Council 
(PCC) and independent Palestinians as well as leaders of 
hardline Palestinian factions Wednesday [9 March] called on 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
not to return to the suspended peace talks with Israel until the 
Jewish state complies with a set of basic demands. 
  It was the strongest yet call on the PLO chairman to quit 
the 
28-month-old peace talks in the wake of the Feb. 25 massacre of 
Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler at a Hebron mosque 
and seek fundamental changes to the format of the negotiations, 
which he suspended after the massacre. 
  The memorandum added to the growing pressure on Mr. 'Arafat 
not to return to the talks. Reports from Tunis, where the PLO 
is headquartered, said senior PLO officials and 'Arafat 
confidants were also calling on Mr. 'Arafat not to relent on his 
demands for international protection for the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories and the inclusion of the status of the 
Jewish settlements there was a topic for negotiations related to 
the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement--an idea that Israel has 
rejected. 
  A memorandum, signed by 130 PNC and PCC members, including 
six members of the PLO Executive Committee and 115 Palestinian 
businessmen, professors, unionists, journalists and acadamics, 
demanded that Israel suspended all settlement activities in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as Jerusalem, dismantle 
existing settlements and remove all settlers from the occupied 
territories. 
  It demanded that international protection be offered to two 
million Palestinans living under Israeli occupation and a United 
Nations force take control over the occupied territories until 
the Palestinians assume responsibility for the terrorities. 
  The memorandum denounced the killings at the Ibrahimi Mosque 
in Hebron as "a brutal, premeditated massacre," and held Israel 
solely responsible for the attack as well as the violence that 
followed, "killing tens of martyrs and wounding hundreds...." 
  "We condemn the American policy that encouraged Israeli 
intransigence and aggression and helped cover up the direct 
responsibility of the Israeli occupation authorities in the 
massacre," said the signatories, who included PLO Executive 
Committee members Taysir Khaled, Abu 'Ali Mustafa, 'Abdallah 
Hurani, 'Abd al-Rahim Malluh, Shafiq al-Hut and Muhammad 
Isma'il, who have either resigned from the panel or frozen their 
membership. 
  "We demand that the ongoing negotiations with the Israeli 
enemy, the bilaterals and multilaterals and all secret and 
public (talks) be stopped until the international community, 
especially the Security Council, responds to us and Israel 
adheres to our just demands," said the memo, also signed by 
prominent PNC and PCC members such as Ibrahim Bakr, Hani Hurani 
and Saji Salameh as well as Popular front for the Liberation of 
Palestine (PFLP) leader George Habash and Democratic Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) Nayif Hawatimah. 
  The PFLP and DFLP are not opposed to negotiated solution to 
the Arab-Iraeli conflict, but they object to the present 
conditions of the peace negotiations which they say are stacked 
against Palestinian aspirations and objectives and would not 
lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. 
  The memorandum set the following conditions for the 
resumption of peace talks: 
  --"The elimination of all settlements and settlement 
activities in accordance with U.N. resulutions, specifically 
Resolution 464 of 1980, which considers settlements as illegal, 
and the evacuation of all settlers from all occupied Palestinian 
territories, including Jerusalem. 
  --"Providing of international protection for the Palestinian 
people under occupation and applying the Fourth Geneva 
Convention of 1949 and forming a U.N. force to temporarily 
provide security there until the Palestinian people and its 
national authority assume responsibility there. 
  --"Negotiations with the Israeli enemy be based on the 
commitment to the resolutions of international legitimacy and of 
the United Nations related to the Palestinian issue and the 
Arab-Israeli conflict with a view to implementing them in a 
manner that guarantees the rights of the Palestinian people to 
return and build their own independent state with Jerusalem as 
its capital. 
  --"The immediate annulment of all agreements, be they 
secret, 
public, political, economic or security, that deny the rights of 
our people to full sovereignty over its land or undermine their 
right to national indepdnence." 
  The memorandum praised Jordan, Syria and Lebanon for 
suspending their peace talks with Israel and caled on them to 
remain steadfast on their position until Israel adheres to the 
legitimate resolutions related to the arab-Israeli conflict." 
  "We call on our people under occupation to solidify their 
national unity and escalate their resistance and holy intifadah 
against the occupation forces and settlers," said the one-page 
memo, accopanied by 16 pages of signatures. "We express our 
deep condolences to our people in Hebron over the death of the 
martyrs. 
  "We call on the Arab states and their political and popular 
forces to unify their efforts in their fight against the 
occupation. 
  "We demand the international community and its human and 
democratic institutions to work on exposing the fascist 
practices of the Israeli occupation authorities."

  [Text] Regarding last Monday's [7 March] operation and the 
pro-Israeli militiaman who was captured by the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PLFLP-GC], an 
official spokesman for the front has made the following 
statement in reply to accusations by the Zionist enemy and its 
agents that the PFLP-GC's fighters killed civilians while they 
were carrying out their heroic operation on the 
al-Rayhan-al-'Ayshiyah Highway last Monday: 
  If our fighters had actually wanted to kill civilians, they 
would not have allowed civilian cars to pass by safely on the 
highway, on which our fighters had set up their ambush for the 
enemy's patrols and its military agents. While we clarify this 
matter for public opinion, we assert that it is the Zionist 
enemy's forces that killed the civilians while they were coming 
on the scene of the heroic operation in order to chase our 
heroic comrades. The PFLP-GC will turn the captive, who was 
brought by our comrades, over to the Islamic Resistance after 
questioning him.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--'Abbas Zaki, Fatah Central Committee 
member, has again held Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
fully responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He said the 
massacre is part of a larger Israeli scheme to empty Hebron and 
Jerusalem of Palestinian citizens to prepare for the 
implementation of the old Zionist idea of a land without people 
for a people without a land. 
  In a seminar organized by the Dialogue and Thought Club at 
Philadelphia University at noon yesterday, Zaki said that 
because they are unsatisfied with the official Palestinian and 
Arab recognition of their entity, the Israelis now want 
religious recognition. Hence, he said, other massacres should 
be expected in the occupied territories in order to move the 
battle from the political to the religious arena. [passage 
omitted] 
  Responding to a question, 'Abbas Zaki said he supports 
negotiations, but believes they should not be the only approach, 
since other methods must be supported. He explained that the 
Vietnamese and Algerian revolutions were negotiating and 
fighting at the same time. 
  Zaki said: The massacre will not go unpunished. 
Instructions have been issued to the Fatah Hawks. However, 
these instructions have not been implemented yet because of the 
Israeli maximum state of alert in anticipation of a painful 
Palestinian response. 
  Complaining about the weak coordination among the joint 
commands in the occupied territories, Zaki said Fatah has made 
no decision to end the armed struggle against the occupation. 
He complained that the Palestinian factions are vying among 
themselves for positions in unions or professional federations 
in the West Bank and Gaza strip, but fail to vie to confront the 
Israeli occupation. 
  He said competition for positions has exposed many 
militants. 
He said Fatah means martyrdom, pride in martyrs, and the 
inevitability of the masses' victory. [passage omitted]
