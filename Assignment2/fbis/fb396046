  [Text] Beirut, 10 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has 
stated that he is confident that the current year will bring the 
beginning of real peace. He said that any delay in the peace 
talks is a "waste," noting that the Arab states have not called 
for suspending the negotiations but for postponing them. He 
pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli leaders need peace 
and that the peace process must move forward. 
  In an interview with the Lebanese magazine AL-HAWADITH, 
President Mubarak stressed that cooperation is needed and is in 
the best interest of all peoples. He noted that, despite the 
animosity that existed between the French and the Germans, their 
common interests dictated that they cooperate. In the 
interview, President Mubarak described terrorists as "hired 
criminals paid by some quarters that seek to cause unrest in 
Egypt or any region." He noted that these quarters spend a lot 
of money to carry out their plans. President Mubarak added that 
the Hebron operation is sheer extremism, noting that extremism 
exists in the United States, England, Australia, and elsewhere. 
  In his remarks to AL-HAWADITH chief editor Milhim Karam, 
President Mubarak touched on the new world order, which he 
described as "a chaotic order." He pointed out that it is 
"wrong" to call it the new world order. He said that this order 
is transitional and not the end of the road. As for the new 
world order, he added, it will come when this chaotic order is 
over. 
  Regarding Iraq, President Mubarak said: We are against 
partitioning Iraq. Our position is clear and firm on this 
matter. President Mubarak described Egypt's relations with Saudi 
Arabia and all the Gulf states as "good and fraternal 
relations." He described Egypt's relations with Lebanon and 
Syria as "fully fraternal relations." 
  Turning to Egypt's relations with Russia, President Mubarak 
said they are "good relations." He added: I do not wish to 
antagonize any country. There is a problem with Iran, and it is 
the one that seeks to antagonize Egypt. We have no relations 
with Iran. We were about to exchange ambassadors a year ago, 
but they disagreed among themselves. 
  Asked about the Hebron massacre and its impact on the peace 
process, President Mubarak said that the massacre at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque is an "appalling tragedy" that pained us all. 
He added: But despite what happened and the difficulties 
facing the negotiations, we believe that the peace process is 
fundamental to the Palestinian people and the entire region. 
President Mubarak expressed confidence that the peace process 
will continue. He added: I know that the Palestinian and 
Israeli leaders need peace and that extremists anywhere on earth 
do not want that because they like to live in an atmosphere of 
extremism. President Mubarak stressed that the peace process is 
serious. He noted that despite the obstacles that exist, which 
is natural in an issue that goes back 45 years, peace will come, 
and the Palestinian issue is at the core of the conflict. He 
expressed his belief that extremism in Israel will not triumph 
and will not blow up the peace process, which is a just demand 
by all peoples. He also expressed confidence that Lebanon and 
Syria will reach a solution with Israel over the Golan and south 
Lebanon. 
  Replying to a question on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre's 
impact on the Cairo Agreement, President Mubarak said he expects 
the negotiations to resume soon after people have calmed down 
and that the parties concerned will sign an accord now that they 
have come so far. He added: I tell the Palestinians to put 
their feet on the ground first and then make demands. He noted 
that the Palestinian side is talking while it is outside its 
land. 
  He stressed the need for cooperation and coordination 
between 
the Palestinians and the parties directly concerned with the 
peace process and said: I have a duty to fulfill, which is 
unifying the fold. 
  Commenting on Arab summits, he said that they are not held 
annually and that Arab division after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait 
resulted in a rift in the Arab world. He affirmed that he is 
doing all he can to clear Arab air for the good of the nation. 
  Concerning Iraq, Mubarak said: We support the Iraqi people 
and stand against partition. We are saddened by their suffering 
because they are Arab Muslim people. (?Had) Saddam Husayn 
(?heard) my sincere advice, it would not have happened, his 
position would have been stronger, and Iraq's power would have 
been a tributary for Arab strength. 
  On the situation in Algeria, he said: I hope our brothers in 
Algeria under President Zeroual's regime will put an end to the 
odious extremism that will destroy all the nation's resources. 
If the parties concerned want the survival of their country, 
they should sit with the Algerian president to discuss solutions 
to end their problems. 
  Regarding the Lockerbie issue, President Mubarak said: We 
have exerted enormous efforts, but the world today is 
preoccupied with Bosnia and Somalia. I hope we will find a way 
out for Libya to resolve the problem because the handover of the 
two Libyan suspects is "difficult and sensitive." 
  Asked about the situation and challenges in Africa in his 
capacity as current chairman of the OAU, President Mubarak noted 
the numerous problems facing development there. He said 
enormous efforts are necessary and that we are doing our best to 
end the conflicts, which are "border disputes." He referred to 
the problems in Liberia, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. 
  He said that had the African countries adhered to the 
African 
summit's resolution in the 1960's, when the late Egyptian 
President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir asked them to stick to the borders 
left by colonialism.... [sentence incomplete as received] 
  Speaking about the Somali problem, President Mubarak said 
that the African summit has entrusted a committee with the task 
of ending this problem but there are difficulties in our way. 
He added: We hosted in Egypt some of the rival parties with 
the exception of General Farah Aidid who did not want to come. 
Mubarak emphasized that as OAU chairman he does not take sides 
with any party against another but that he speaks about all of 
them with extreme fairness and neutrality. He said: We are 
working for Somalia's unity and the Somali parties have to agree 
among themselves so that their people can survive. 
  Asked about Sudan and the Hala'ib issue, President Mubarak 
said: What is this Hala'ib? They want to fabricate a story with 
us. They did so during the days of the late Presidents Anwar 
al-Sadat and Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir. Al-Turabi wants to create a 
problem. They are free to do as they please but as for us we 
have no problem. 
  President Mubarak stressed the need to launch a dialogue 
between the north and the south and said it is unreasonable for 
the north to live a very affluent life while the south lives at 
subsistence level. 
  As for the Nonaligned Movement, Mubarak said: They are all 
aligned. The small countries need the big ones to help them in 
development. This is what brother Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi said 
and he is right; everyone is aligned. But as for today, with 
whom and against whom should alignment be? The Nonaligned 
Movement is losing the reasons for its existence. 
  Asked about development in Egypt, the president noted the 
great efforts that have been made to rebuild the infrastructure 
and said: We have spent 100 billion pounds for this purpose. 
  On the effect of the acts of violence on tourism in Egypt, 
President Mubarak said the number of tourists arriving in Egypt 
has indeed decreased but Egypt, which has seven thousand years 
of civilization, will not be affected by a group of terrorists 
who have nothing to do with religion.

  [Text] London, 11 Mar (MENA)--Egyptian Interior Minister 
Major General Hasan al-Alfi has stated that the security 
services recently foiled several terror schemes. 
  He told the London-based Arabic daily AL-HAYAH that police 
identified and monitored the extremist groups after tightening 
control of desert areas, shanty towns, and Nile islands, where 
those groups had their secret hideouts. 
  Al-Alfi stressed that foreign quarters are involved in the 
terrorist operations in Egypt. 
  He said police are constantly directing abortive blows at 
terrorist schemes. The arrest of those involved in recent bank 
bombings in Cairo and al-Jizah comes within this context, he 
said. 
  The interior minister renewed rejection of a dialogue with 
the terrorists. 
  He said terrorists try to create what he described as "media 
furor." Some foreign news media help them by inflating their 
operations, he noted. 
  Al-Alfi said Egyptian security agencies are watching 
developments in the structure of the terrorist groups on every 
level, beginning with relations among them and ending with the 
splits and alliances that affect changes of membership. 
  He said Egypt is in constant touch with foreign states where 
some extremist leaders reside. 
  Al-Alfi said the lack of indictment against Ayman 
al-Zawahiri, an al-Jihad organization leader now living in 
Switzerland, in the case of the attempt on Prime Minister 'Atif 
Sidqi's life concerns the interrogation authorities. Perhaps 
those authorities don't have enough evidence for an indictment, 
he said.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Mar (MENA)-- Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has revealed a serious, sizable terrorist scheme that 
was ready for implementation during 'Id al-Adha. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, 
Friday, the interior minister disclosed that the security 
agencies managed to frustrate the scheme beforehand, after 
seizing faxed instructions from abroad found in the possession 
of the 25 terrorists arrested last Sunday. 
  Al-Alfi added that the dreadful scheme sought to terrify the 
public by carrying out a number of terrorist operations such as 
blowing up a considerable number of recreation grounds, cinemas, 
and theaters and assassinating a number of public figures. 
  In the interview, al-Alfi reveals that large amounts of 
money, estimated at thousands of dollars, were found in the 
possession of the members of this new terrorist organization, 
which belongs to the "Islamic Group," who were involved in 
recent attempts to blow up banks. The money was being used to 
finance their operations. 
  Al-Alfi added that large amounts of material used in making 
high-explosive charges were discovered in hideouts in Asyut and 
Cairo. Sent from abroad, the material contained new substances 
that were to be used for the first time and were to be set off 
by remote control to cause the largest possible explosions.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--An Israeli Arab delegation led 
by 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, leader of the Arab Democratic Party 
and member of the Israeli Knesset, arrived in Cairo from 
Damascus this morning. 
  Arriving, Darawshah said the delegation met Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad, who stated that Syria wants a just and 
comprehensive peace in accordance with UN resolutions and that 
it is ready to apply the principle of "full peace in return for 
full withdrawal." 
  Darawshah said al-Asad stressed that Syria wants to 
strengthen and unify Arab coordination to mark real achievements 
for the Arab parties. Al-Asad explained that Syria has a free 
Arab will and that no solution can be imposed on it through 
pressure or coercion. 
  Darawshah said he also met Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar', who stressed Syria's readiness to receive Israeli Arab 
delegations any time. 
  Darawshah said the Syrian Government did not ask him to 
convey a specific message to the Israeli Government. But what 
he heard is considered a message of peace, which he will 
sincerely convey to the Israeli Knesset and Government. 
  Concluding, Darawshah said: We trust the Syrian stance, 
which seeks to achieve peace. The ball is now in Israel's 
court. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin must frankly 
declare that he is ready for a full withdrawal. Darawshah said 
Syria is against settlement activity in the occupied territories 
and demands international protection for the Palestinians.

  [Text] Angry demonstrations protesting the Hebron massacre 
have taken place in the Cairo universities for the second 
successive week. The demonstrations extended to regional 
universities, most notably Alexandria and al-Zaqaziq. In 
al-Zaqaziq University, the students of the Nasirist Ideology 
Club led a demonstration of thousands of students the day before 
yesterday protesting Arab inaction and the surrender of the PLO 
under 'Arafat. 
  Last Thursday, at Alexandria University, the security forces 
stormed the campus and used shotguns, tear gas canisters, and 
electric clubs [al-'usi al-kahraba'iyah] in an attempt to 
disperse thousands of student demonstrators, wounding over 100 
students, including eight who were taken to the university 
hospital and the Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir Hospital.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Rajab] </F>
  [Excerpts] Hundreds of people were wounded and hundreds of 
others were detained as a result of the security forces' savage 
suppression of the uprising of the angry Egyptian people in 
protest against the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The Interior 
Ministry last week mobilized tens of thousands of central 
security and antiterrorism forces to suppress the popular 
demonstrations, which started from the universities, mosques, 
and trade union headquarters. These forces used extremely 
sophisticated weapons, including modern tear gas canister 
launchers, which have a range double that of the older type. 
The type of the canisters used is also more effective than the 
other tear gas canisters, as they cause serious inflammation to 
the stomach's mucous membrane and to the respiratory system. 
The rest of the repression arsenal included rubber bullets, 
shotgun cartridges, and electric clubs [al-'usi al- kahraba'iyah. 
  More than 1,000 people, most of them students, were arrested 
last week. They were all charged with illegal gathering and 
rioting and then most of them were released. The number of 
people injured exceeded 800, most of them students. At Cairo 
University the number of injured up to last Thursday was 116 
male and female students. Ten people were seriously wounded, 
most of them as a result of shotgun pellets. Some of them said 
they were wounded inside the university campus. [passage omitted] 
  The situation at 'Ayn Shams University was no better than at 
Cairo University. The police opened fire with shotguns from 
close range at the demonstrators, seriously wounding a large 
number of students. Some of them lost their sight as a result 
of shotgun pellets. The 'Ayn Shams hospital received 60 wounded 
students up to last Thursday. Thirty others were admitted to 
the Dar al-Shifa' hospital.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--The Cairo-based paper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH says the time has come for Israel to honestly 
determine its position on peace. Bloody confrontations in the 
streets of the West Bank and Gaza, says the paper, emphasize 
that the Israeli occupation is heading toward an end and that 
Israeli army foot patrols cannot roam the streets of Palestinian 
villages and cities forever. 
  The paper says in its editorial today that if the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement was considered a positive step toward 
disengaging the Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian 
masses in the West Bank and Gaza, hopes have, or almost have, 
been dashed, thanks to the Hebron massacre, Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's refusal to evacuate or disarm the 
settlers, and the Security Council's failure to clearly and 
unequivocally condemn the carnage. 
  It would appear that correct beginnings do not lead to 
correct results in Israel's political and negotiatory lexicon, 
the paper says. It explains: The world considered the Madrid 
conference for Middle East peace to be the beginning of the end 
of the bitter conflict in the region within a framework of a 
just and lasting peace. But the horrible Hebron massacre threw 
all hopes into uncertainty. 
  The paper believes peace is in Israel's interest. It says 
Israel, in return for Arab recognition, must work for mutual 
peace and security and show good intentions by offering 
realistic concessions commensurate with the importance of ending 
the Middle East conflict.

General Haytham Qasim Tahir.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad </F>
Basindwah, in Sanaa, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo; date not 
given; on the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, good morning and welcome to 
the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Basindwah] Good morning to you. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih 
briefly visited Cairo on Wednesday and met President Muhammad 
Husni Mubarak. You attended the meeting. What were the main 
topics of discussion in light of the Yemeni crisis and the 
Egyptian role? 
  [Basindwah] First, I would like to note that the ease with 
which the visit was quickly organized reflects the warmth of 
relations between Sanaa and Cairo. There are no formalities 
between the two countries. The hospitality was warm and as 
expected. Sanaa senses Cairo's interest in Yemeni developments. 
This is why President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih visited his brother 
His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak to inform him of 
the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. He said that 
Sanaa fully accepts Cairo's mediation and role by President 
Mubarak to bring viewpoints closer. Sanaa always looks forward 
to Cairo playing its major pan-Arab role. Cairo has always been 
the source of hope for the Arab nation. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Were there new proposals to resolve the 
crisis, 
especially as the visit of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih came 
amid high tension between him and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who visited Cairo before signing the Pledge and Accord 
Document? 
  [Basindwah] I believe that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's 
visit to Cairo did not come amid a deterioration of the crisis, 
certainly not on the military level. I believe the military 
crisis has virtually been defused. But there are continuing 
political differences and the ice between Aden and Sanaa must be 
melted. Cairo can play a major role here. Undoubtedly, there is 
agreement on particular things that Cairo will do. Sanaa and 
President Salih welcome this. President Salih hopes the credit 
for ending the crisis will go to Cairo. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important things Egypt will 
do to end this crisis? We have always hoped that we would see 
Yemeni unity take its natural and realistic course as a model 
for comprehensive Arab unity. 
  [Basindwah] I cannot reveal much; we must take the advice of 
our noble prophet, may God's peace be upon him, especially in 
this blessed month of Ramadan, to be secretive when we go about 
our businesses. I can tell you that Cairo has a vision, a 
method to resolve the crisis. I believe this vision is 
reasonable and Cairo must work with the parties to the conflict 
to implement its proposals. Everybody must realize that the 
Yemenis' relations with each other are not relations between two 
peoples or two countries. We in Yemen are one Arab Muslim 
people, one Arab Muslim country. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are Egypt's ideas on this concept? 
  [Basindwah] Cairo believes the Pledge and Accord Document is 
the basis for heading toward ending the crisis. As long as 
everyone clings to the Document, we need only discuss the 
mechanisms of how to implement it. Undoubtedly, the 
implementation will take place within the framework of the 
Constitution. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But, Minister, the vice president and 
president 
were supposed to return to Sanaa after signing the document in 
the Jordanian capital, Amman. This did not happen and military 
clashes took place. Why did the crisis escalate and what do you 
believe is the solution? 
  [Basindwah] Of course, the president, vice president, and 
the 
entire government were supposed to return to Sanaa after the 
Document was signed in Amman on 20 February. But we all know 
what happened. The signing was accompanied by military 
escalation. Let us be optimistic and hope that 'Id al-Fitr will 
introduce goodwill for Yemen and the Arab and Islamic nations as 
well as for the whole world. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party, Minister, has some 
demands, such as arresting those who assassinated some of its 
leaders and other things. Is the People's Congress ready to 
meet these demands? 
  [Basindwah] I cannot speak for the People's Congress because 
I am not a member. I belong to no party. I am independent, I 
repeat, independent, and I say this very frankly. But I also 
say that we, as government officials, need to cooperate to 
arrest all those who are proven to have been involved in the 
assassination operations. This is a group responsibility that we 
must all shoulder. None of us should attempt to weasel out of 
it. Anyone who tries to shy away from this responsibility must 
be punished and held accountable for doing so. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, are there any mediators other than 
Cairo involved in trying to resolve the crisis? 
  [Basindwah] There is a lot of mediation and from various 
sides but the more acceptable mediation comes from the brothers. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Is there any mediation from outside the Arab 
world? 
  [Basindwah] Of course, some friends who are not Arabs are 
using their good offices continuously to reduce the tension. 
But there is no mediation in the sense of sitting round a table 
to discuss how to get out of the crisis. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Can you give us some examples of these 
mediating countries from outside the Arab world? 
  [Basindwah] Of course, heading these countries is the 
friendly United States. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Is this mediation acceptable to both sides? 
  [Basindwah] Both sides accept this mediation. There are also 
the good offices of the European Union. And there are the 
constructive and objective efforts or positions of Japan, 
Russia, China, and many friendly countries. 
  [Basindwah] But what, for the Yemeni people, is the closest 
mediation that could realize a final solution to the crisis? 
  [Basindwah] The mediation of the brothers, primarily Egypt.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London and Hammud Munsir </F>
and Naji al-Harazi in Sanaa: "Sanaa Seeking Egyptian Role to 
Resolve Yemeni Crisis; the General People's Congress and the 
Reform Grouping Consider Excluding the Socialist Party From the 
Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Political circles in the Yemeni capital see 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to Cairo yesterday 
evening "as a move reflecting Yemeni interest in an Egyptian 
role to end the political crisis between the General People's 
Congress [GPC] and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] which has 
become a complicated problem between the north and the south and 
a threat to Yemen's unity." 
  Sources say that the Egyptian role is of considerable 
importance at this stage because "it gives the Gulf states some 
kind of reassurance that the Jordanian mediation could not 
provide." 
  A senior source in the GPC, which is led by the Yemeni 
president, has stated that "there are increasing notions about 
secession among the southern brothers and I do not know whether 
or not that is based on any specific calculations." He said 
that local calculations have become more complex since the 
introduction of the system of political pluralism, and that is 
what "the secessionist desires" would face, unlike foreign 
calculations "which are based on a desire to calm the situation 
and avoid a military explosion in Yemen, regardless of whether 
or not secession occurs." 
  The GPC official played down the significance of what went 
on 
during a joint meeting of the lederships of the GPC and the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], part of which was attended by the 
president before leaving for Cairo. The meeting was said to 
have discussed more coordination between the GPC and the YRG 
with emerging inclinations to terminate the ruling coalition in 
Yemen with in order to exclude the YSP from government. Some of 
the conferees also called for intervention to settle the crisis 
by military means. 
  The GPC official said that "discussions which take place in 
the absence of the president are of no great importance because 
no decisions are made and no clear policies are decided in such 
discussions." 
  He added that "decisions have already been made on these 
matters and the position will be determined in the light of the 
solution which might result from the current attempts to resolve 
the crisis." 
  He said that "the YSP's notions about secession are perhaps 
meant to pave the way for a federal solution." 
  Meanwhile, the son and nephew of Yemeni Agriculture Minister 
Shaykh Sadiq Amin Abu-Ras have been released as a result of 
efforts made by Shaykh 'Ali Bin-Naji al-Ruwayshan, chief of the 
al-Yamaniyah al-'Ulya tribe in Khawlan. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 10 Mar (INA) -- The Kurdistan Revolutionary 
Party has appealed to the Kurdish masses in Kurdistan to step up 
resistance against the agent cliques and foreign occupation. It 
urged them to make sacrifices for the honor of Iraqis and for 
Kurdistan to regain its freedom, joy, and national allegiance. 
  In a statement issued by the party's political bureau on the 
24th anniversary of the 11 March Statement of 1970 and the 20th 
anniversary of issuing the autonomy law in 1974, the party said 
the evil criminals -- the brokers of world politics -- are not 
satisfied with the war of annihilation they waged against our 
Kurdish people. Thus, they have gone a step further by stealing 
the property of the Kurdish masses, smuggling this property to 
Iran, and selling it in their own interest. Those evil 
criminals are not satisfied with undermining Kurdish national 
rights and sabotaging the autonomy institutions. Thus, they 
have embarked on a new mockery to split in half power centers, 
institutions, and interests. 
  The party hailed the wise leadership of President Saddam 
Husayn, the hero of liberation and engineer of autonomy. It 
praised President Saddam Husayn's courageous stand in the face 
of all the vile plots being hatched against our Iraqi people.

  [Text] Baghdad, 9 Mar (INA)--BABIL accused U.S. President 
Bill Clinton of lying in his message to Congress on his decision 
to renew the economic embargo on Iraq under the pretext that 
Iraq did not implement Security Council resolutions. 
  In an article today, the newspaper said that the U.S. 
President and the Congress are fully aware that all the reports 
of the UN Special Commission have emphasized that Iraq has met 
all of the requirements in the Security Council resolutions. 
  The paper added: This Iraqi commitment should urge the 
Security Council to adhere to its own commitments regarding the 
lifting of the embargo on Iraqi oil exports. It said: Ignoring 
this fact exposes the evil intentions aimed at infringing on 
Iraq's legitimate right and the determination to perpetuate the 
unjust siege against Iraq without regard to the suffering of the 
Iraqi people. 
  The newspaper said that further criminal behavior in the 
service of Zionism and backwardness clearly shows the extent of 
the hatred towards Iraq, which is due only to Iraq's defense of 
its freedom and independent decisionmaking. 
  The newspaper emphasized that the successive pretexts the 
evil ones present with the aim of maintaining the siege will 
soon be refuted and exposed to the world, and even to many 
permanent Security Council members. The newspaper said faithful 
and patient Iraq will never accept this evil U.S. behavior, and 
will not bow to the continuation of injustice it faces. 
  BABIL concluded by recalling that Iraq has fulfilled the 
commitments imposed on it according to the Security Council 
resolutions, and the council should, in turn, fulfill its 
commitments in accordance with the same resolutions. The 
Security Council should not bow to the U.S. terrorism that has 
gone beyond all reasonable limits and become a sword threatening 
free peoples everywhere and even the big powers.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column: "The Statement Which Exposed Their </F>
Lies" by Mu'ayyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah] 
  [Excerpts] The Security Council's UN Special Commission 
[UNSCOM] issued a statement two days ago in which it refuted 
widespread claims about the Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the 
Marshlands, saying they were false. The commission's denial has 
come after investigations, field visits, and laboratory tests in 
London, Paris, and Washington have disproved these claims, which 
were lodged in a UN complaint earlier. 
  Although we knew the aims and motives of these lies right 
from the start and said they were cheap lies intended to disturb 
Iraq, justify the continuation of the blockade, and find an 
excuse for further interference in Iraq's internal affairs in 
the name of human rights, the UNSCOM statement has confirmed how 
false and malicious were the reports submitted by Max Van der 
Stoel [UN human rights official for Iraq]. The reports were 
packed with lies and made unwarranted proposals about appointing 
observers and setting up committees to protect what was termed 
human rights in the marshlands. This Dutchman, who made endless 
accusations and held news conferences everywhere to create an 
uproar about alleged terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, 
was certified to be reckless and nonobjective by his own 
classmate, UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali, even before we 
issued our own testimony on him. In fact, the statement 
released by UNSCOM, which sponsored the allegations and set up 
committees that spent a great deal of time on them, has come at 
this time to put an end to this cheap lie and to serve as a 
lesson for Van der Stoel and his backers. [passage omitted] 
  The UNSCOM statement is testimony for Iraq and a slap in the 
face for its enemies. It has exposed their slander. This 
statement has come to reveal the truth and to expose those who 
spread false allegations. It now behooves the commission to 
also go deep into the flood of lies that preceded this one, 
whose aims have now been exposed. 
  Yes, the main problem now hampering the actions that must be 
taken by the UN Security Council are the lies and allegations by 
certain regional quarters and aggressor states. They release 
them from time to time, and sometimes deny them almost 
overnight, despited the fact that Iraq has affirmed its 
commitment to and cooperation with implementing UN Security 
Council Resolution 687, especially since the motives of those 
quarters are not secret to anyone. What we want to say is that 
the objective efforts to do justice to Iraq, must now find their 
true course toward common positive action to remove the 
injustices done to Iraq.

  [Text] Israel has been informed that Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev intends to arrive here on 12 March. When 
he arrives Foreign Minister Kozyrev will hear Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin's and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' reservations 
about Russia's latest initiatives with regard to the peace 
process. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Raz] Israel's political leadership would 
gladly forgo Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's unexpected 
visit. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres 
have both officially rejected the initiative, proposed one week 
ago by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov, to reconvene an 
international conference or send a Russian official on a shuttle 
mission to the Middle East. That is why they were surprised by 
this afternoon's report. 
  [Rabin] I heard about it on the radio. The deputy foreign 
minister also made this proposal. We have no intention of 
holding a second Madrid conference. We have no intention of 
permitting any international presence beyond what was agreed 
upon in the Declaration of Principles -- and I am clearly 
referring to a nonmilitary international presence in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho after agreement is reached with the 
Palestinians on the Gaza-Jericho First proposal, and following 
or during the implementation of the agreement. 
  [Raz] Prime Minister Rabin expressed concern about the very 
future of the political process in light of Russia's desire to 
become more involved without prior coordination with the United 
States. 
  [Rabin] I prefer that things continue the way they have been 
handled up till now. I hope this step will not complicate the 
chances of renewing the peace negotiations both with the 
Palestinians and with the relevant Arab states. At any rate, we 
will graciously receive any visitor here but at the same time 
unequivocally explain our position. 
  [Raz] Israel's position will also be expressed by Foreign 
Minister Peres, who is annoyed by the Russian attempt to 
reconvene the Madrid conference. 
  [Peres] I do not understand why. First of all, we have to 
implement what has already been agreed upon. The Middle East 
cannot constantly be inundated with declarations. It is time to 
take actual steps. 
  [Raz] So this proposal is unacceptable to Israel? 
  [Peres] We said that it does not strike us as particurlarly 
constructive. 
  [Raz] When he arrives on Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister 
Kozyrev will be apprised of the Israeli leadership's 
reservations and doubts with regard to his proposal. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Finance Minister Avraham Shohat met with his 
Hungarian counterpart, Ivan Szabo, yesterday. The two men 
discussed strengthening commercial ties between the two 
countries; the activities of Israeli companies in Hungary; 
Israel's participation in Expo 96, which will take place in 
Budapest; and the return of property to the relatives of Jewish

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Hayim Zissowitz -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zissowitz] Let us talk about 
the Syrian track of the peace talks, which has not been affected 
-- or has been less affected -- by the Hebron massacre. Did you 
read the minutes of the meeting between Knesset Member [MK] 
'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
yesterday? 
  [Peres] Yes. 
  [Zissowitz] Did you detect any new messages? 
  [Peres] No, I just detected softer language. It is 
interesting to note that this was a meeting between the Syrian 
president and Israeli representatives, although they did not 
enter the country with their Israeli passports and did not 
highlight the fact that they are Israelis and members of the 
Knesset. This, too, is one of the signs of the times. 
  You know, we have long outgrown the era of charades, of 
hiding, disguising, and pretending. What good is it? That, 
however, seems to be the way of the world up north. 
  [Zissowitz] In the meeting, President al-Asad reiterated his 
formula of full peace in exchange for full withdrawal. Is 
Israel prepared to accept such a formula? 
  [Peres] First of all, I do not know what full peace is. 
When he talks about full peace, what is it filled with? For 
example, he did not undertake to fill it with diplomatic 
representations, commercial ties, and open borders. So what 
does full mean? 
  [Zissowitz] Did you hear the utterances of MK's Talib 
al-Sani' and Darawshah during a tour of the Golan Heights and in 
other meetings? 
  [Peres] I think they are both MK's, and whatever their 
criticism of Israel is, they should voice it in Jerusalem rather 
than in al-Qunaytirah. In my opinion, both good manners and 
logic call for highlighting the positive and the things we have 
in common. 
  [Zissowitz] Do Israeli MK's who talk on the Syrian side of 
the Golan Heights about the terrible oppression of the 
Palestinians and who say that the lot of Israel's Arabs is worse 
than that of Syria's Jews truly represent Israeli Arabs? 
  [Peres] I do not believe that. I do not recall the Syrian 
Parliament ever having had a Jewish member. As you know, every 
Syrian Jew may come to Israel, but can every Israeli Arab go to 
Syria? We all know that not even all Arabs are allowed in, but 
only people who belong to a certain party, group, and belief. 
Even then, they are not issued passports or allowed to 
publicize their identity. In this respect, if you were to 
compare the Israeli delegation's visit to Syria with visits to 
Israel by foreign delegations to meet with Arabs and others, the 
difference would immediately strike you. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The distress of Judaea and Samaria settlers is 
being handled by the Action Committee for the Annulment of the 
Autonomy Plan, which is currently disseminating a videocassette 
encouraging civil revolt. The tape recommends evading military 
service and not paying taxes as a means of opposing the 
government's policy. Yiftah El'azar reports: 
  The hero of the videocassette is an imaginary character 
called Ron Segev, a tank brigade commander, and deals with his 
misgivings under the autonomy. Segev is detained by a joint 
patrol of the Palestinian police and the Israeli Border Police 
while demonstrating against Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in East 
Jerusalem. Segev decides to become a prisoner of conscience and 
inspires others to follow in his footsteps. Elyaqim Ha'etzni, 
head of the action committee, hopes that in real life Israelis 
will turn to civil revolt. 
  [Begin Ha'etzni recording] It is a path of non-violence 
aimed at opposing a regime which almost clandestinely -- we call 
it the Oslo underground -- surprised and hoodwinked the nation, 
and with the help of pro-PLO votes in the Knesset, is taking the 
country away from the people. It is a path of nonviolence. 
[end recording] 
  The cassette contains the names of right-wing intellectuals, 
such as Professor Yisra'el Eldad and Prof. Hilel Weiss, as well 
as senior military commanders in the reserves, who support the 
action. Among the measures recommended are dodging military 
reserve duty and evading the payment of taxes. Ha'etzni said it 
is important to learn how to carry out civil revolt in order to 
prevent a repetition of actions like that of Barukh Goldstein, 
who perpetrated the Hebron massacre.

<F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin and ITIM] </F>
  [Excerpts] Palestinian sources yesterday reported 31 local 
residents wounded in incidents with IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
troops in the Gaza Strip. According to their report, there were 
incidents in Khan Yunus, Jabalyah, and al-Shati'. 
  The IDF spokesman for the Southern Command did not report 
any 
casualties among Arab residents. 
  There were several events in the West Bank: An Israeli 
civilian was hurt in a stoning incident and two Arab residents 
were injured in a clash with IDF soldiers. 
  An IDF soldier sustained a slight head injury when hit by a 
stone in Rafah. The soldier received medical treatment and was 
sent back to his unit. 
  The security forces and the IDF are maintaining very high 
alert in anticipation of terrorist attacks by Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], mainly suicide attacks. 
  Security has been augmented and alert declared also in the 
Qatif Bloc settlements following an 8 March Hamas leaflet 
announcing a five-stage action plan against settlers. [passage 
omitted] 
  An Israeli civilian was yesterday wounded in the head when 
his car was stoned as he was driving on the Bi'r Nabala-al-Rajib 
road in the Ramallah District. After receiving treatment from 
an Army doctor who was summoned to the site, he was evacuated to 
a Jerusalem hospital. 
  In downtown Ramallah, two local residents were slightly 
wounded while hurling stones at Border Police. In an attempt to 
capture the stone throwers, the policemen fired rubber bullets. 
The casualties were evacuated to the central hospital in 
Ramallah and then sent home. 
  An Israeli girl was slightly injured by shattered glass when 
the car in which was she riding was pelted with stones near 
Silat al-Zahr in the vicinity of Janin. The child was evacuated 
to the Homesh settlement, treated, and released. The IDF 
launched searches. 
  The Hayarqon District Police launched an investigation after 
leaflets calling for murdering soldiers and settlers were 
disseminated in various locations in Tel Aviv. The leaflets, 
handwritten in Hebrew and Arabic, were placed in mailboxes early 
Wednesday morning. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 10 March 
adds that "in Rafah, the Army last night captured a wanted 
terrorist in what was described as an initiated action," and "a 
firebomb was thrown at an Egged bus at al-Jalazun, but caused no 
injuries or damage."]

  [Text] The curfew on the territories begins its third week 
today. Yesterday was the fifth day of violent incidents in the 
Gaza Strip. A 15-year-old youth was killed and some 20 people 
were wounded, and two fugitives were captured in a special 
operation yesterday. Nisim Qeynan reports: 
  For a week, there have been serious daily incidents in the 
Gaza Strip. A wide-ranging operation to capture fugitives was 
conducted in the Dayr al-Balah refugee camp. A curfew was 
clamped on the camp, and the security forces operated in a 
highly populated area to capture two wanted men, Hasan 
Abu-Daramah and Zayid Hasinat, 21, belonging to the Fatah Hawks, 
and four others who sheltered them. Palestinians rioted to 
disturb the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] efforts to apprehend the 
fugitives. At one stage, the rioters shot at the soldiers. One 
was slightly wounded, and another was hit by stones. The 
soldiers fired at the rioting mob, killing a 15-year-old youth. 
  During the searches for the wanted men, antitank missiles 
were fired at several houses in which fugitives were suspected 
to be hiding, and the buildings sustained serious damage. In 
additional searches in the area, many weapons were found. The 
two detained fugitives are suspected of firing at security 
forces in Dayr al-Balah. 
  In other locations, 15-20 people were wounded in rioting in 
the Jabalyah refugee camp, al-Shati', Rafah, and Khan Yunus, 
according to Palestinian sources. During the incidents in Gaza, 
a border policeman was slightly wounded when hit by stones and 
was taken to the hospital. 
  The IDF is on an especially high alert on Fridays. The 
curfew imposed on many areas will be lifted for two hours to 
enable the residents to stock up on food. The closure continues 
until decided otherwise. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0500 GMT on 11 March 
adds details on incidents at other locations in the territories 
yesterday. "In Tulkarm, an Israeli truck driver was lightly 
hurt from glass fragments in a stone-throwing attack when his 
windshield was shattered, and in Hebron, a shock grenade was 
hurled at an Army patrol. The grenade went off. No one was 
hurt and no damage was caused."]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Government Spokesman Raphael </F>
Gamzou [name as published], in Jerusalem, and PLO representative 
to Rome Nimr Hammad, in Rome, by Franca Zambonini; date not 
given: "The Torn Peace" -- first two paragraphs are FAMIGLIA 
CRISTIANA introduction] 
  [Text] That thin fabric that Israel and the PLO [Palestine 
Liberation Organization] had begun weaving six months ago has 
been torn in a week of bloodshed. In Hebron, a Jew has 
massacred dozens of Palestinian Arabs praying in the mosque, in 
Beirut, Lebanese Christians have been butchered during a church 
service, and in New York, a Lebanese has opened fire on orthodox 
Jewish students, two of whom are at death's door. Meanwhile, a 
sequence of further deaths in the occupied territories, which 
are once again in revolt, is adding, drop by drop, to the trail 
of blood. Agreements, negotiations, and expectations have gone 
by the board, reason and history have retreated in the face of 
raging fanatism. Does peace remain an impossible dream? 
  Advisor Raphael Gamzou, spokesman for the Israeli 
Government, 
and Nimr Hammad, the Palestinian representative in Italy, 
answered this question from, respectively, Jerusalem and Rome. 
  [Gamzou] In the long term, I am optimistic. All the parties 
concerned know full well that there are no alternatives. 
Negotiation remains the only way open. Breaking off means 
rewarding the extremists. 
  [Hammad] The massacres have opened people's eyes to reality. 
The front is everybody's now. The future of the peace is in the 
hands of the Israeli government. Six months have gone by since 
that 13 September when the Washington agreements were signed, 
and nothing has changed. All we have seen is delays in their 
application. If the Hebron massacre induces Prime Minister 
Rabin to be intransigent with the settlers and persuades him to 
withdraw them from the settlements, there will be greater 
grounds for optimism. But if Rabin thinks that the PLO has no 
choice but to negotiate at all costs, he is making a mistake and 
giving greater grounds for pessimism. 
  [Zambonini] Is it feasible to disarm the settlers 
completely, 
as the PLO has demanded as the first condition for resuming the 
negotiations? 
  [Gamzou] Total disarmament is impossible and unacceptable 
for 
us, even after the Hebron massacre, which has filled us with 
grief and shame. Every day brings acts of terrorism on the part 
of the Islamic extremist of the Hamas movement, and the settlers 
must be in a position to defend themselves. But the government 
has already begun disarming the hard core of fanatical Jews and 
it has ordered their expulsion from the territories and the 
administrative arrest of the leaders of the extremist movements, 
such as the Kakh. 
  [Hammad] The measures adopted by Rabin are a cosmetic 
operation that does nothing to treat the real sickness that the 
settlements represent. What does disarming only the extremists 
mean? All the settlers are extremists, because their movement 
has a precise ideology: that of Eretz Yisrael [name as 
published], the Land of Israel that they consider theirs by 
divine right. Rabin must understand that this ambiguity is 
playing into the hands of the extremist fanatics. It is true 
that Rabin has freed 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. But why did 
he wait so long? Shall we need another massacre before he takes 
another step forward? 
  [Zambonini] PLO Chairman 'Arafat has called for an armed 
international force to be sent in to protect the Palestinians. 
The government of Israel has said no. Was it right or wrong to 
do so? 
  [Hammad] It was very wrong. We called for an armed 
international force because the Israeli army gives us no 
guarantee of protection. Quite the contrary. Israeli soldiers 
have killed more than 20 Palestinian demonstrators over the last 
week. Even before the Madrid talks that opened the way for the 
peace negotiations two years ago, the European Community had 
proposed an international presence in the cities, the villages, 
and the Palestinian refugee camps, accompanied by the withdrawal 
of the Israeli troops from the occupied territories. The 
proposal was accepted neither by Israel nor by the United 
States. These rigid stances are tombstones for peace. 
  [Gamzou] The Israeli Government was right to say no. The 
best way ahead is direct negotiation between ourselves and the 
PLO, without foreign interference. We had already reached an 
understanding on the first part of the Oslo Agreement, on 
autonomy for the Gaza and Jericho areas. But then the 
psychopath from Hebron ruined everything. Now we have an 
explosion of Palestinian rage, which is quite understandable. 
We are putting our money on American mediation and the 
multilateral negotiations that have the task of building the new 
Middle East. Article 3(d) of the supplementary protocol to the 
Oslo Agreement provides for a temporary international presence 
in the Gaza and Jericho areas to supervise the implementation of 
the agreements. This article may help us find a compromise 
between the PLO's requirements and our own. I would not rule 
out an agreement on a certain nonmilitary international 
presence, but it must remain within the context of the 
negotiations between the PLO and ourselves. 
  [Zambonini] Have the tragic events of the last few days 
weakened 'Arafat's position? 
  [Gamzou] Definitely, just as they have weakened all those 
who 
support him in his decision in favor of dialogue. But our 
government, too, is having difficulty with public opinion, 
because the Palestinian terrorist attacks have continued even 
after the recognition of the PLO and since the start of the 
negotiations. There has been a succession of victims. 
Nevertheless, we have said that we shall carry on with the 
negotiations as if there were no terrorism, and we shall 
continue fighting terrorism as if there were no negotiations. 
  [Hammad] The whole of the PLO has been weakened. After the 
signing in Washington, the opinion polls showed 68 percent of 
Palestinians in favor of the agreements. Today I am not sure we 
would reach 50 percent. We have regressed to a worse position 
than before. The lay portion of the Palestinian movement, which 
was pursuing the political solution of "two peoples, two 
states," has failed to get results, and the hope of peace has 
thus become more remote. 
  [Zambonini] What is the alternative? 
  [Gamzou] There is no alternative to the negotiations. We 
have learnt in the last few days what great damage a minute 
fraction of extremists can do to the peace process. In the 
Knesset last week, all the parties, from the Right to the Left, 
voted the same motion condemning all forms of extremism is the 
strongest terms. Such great unanimity had never been seen 
before in our parliament. This is a sign that, regardless of 
political divisions, the overwhelming majority of Israeli 
society is united in the quest for peace. 
  [Hammad] The alternative is a tragic one. The Middle East is 
entering a new phase in which anyone can grow a fundamentalist's 
beard and launch a new war. Rabin does not have the strength to 
dismantle the settlements, claiming that it would provoke a 
civil war. In this way, he stands firm on his principles and 
wants to force the PLO to accept them, while the settlers can 
destroy what we are laboriously building up to create a climate 
of mutual confidence. We are stuck in a blind alley, while the 
extremists have the upper hand.

several sons of the Musawi [Jewish] community in Syria 
yesterday. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, head of the Palestinian 
delegation, said the Musawi community in Syria is part of the 
Syrian people. He said they met with them to clarify some 
Israeli political and public opinion issues, and to bring back a 
message of the true image of their life in Syria. 
  Darawshah said the delegation will visit a synagogue and a 
Musawi community school today to prove to all who seek to 
distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate against the 
Musawi community. 
  Yusuf Jajati, deputy head of the Musawi community in Syria, 
denounced the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He said: In the 
name of the Musawi community, we strongly denounce these 
actions. Jajati stressed that the Musawi community is living in 
Syria in peace. He expressed hope that a just and comprehensive 
peace will be achieved in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, head of the </F>
Israeli Arab delegation currently visiting Syria, by 'Isam Dari, 
in Damascus on 9 March] 
  [Text] [Dari] We asked delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah for his impressions of his visit to Syria and the 
meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and members of the 
delegation. He said: 
  [Begin recording] [Darawshah] We met with the president to 
perform a pan-Arab, social, and humanitarian duty, to offer 
condolences on the death of his son Basil, may God have mercy 
upon his soul. That is the primary objective of our visit. The 
president received us very warmly, as a great father of all the 
sons of the Arab nation. He welcomed us, and gave us a detailed 
briefing on Syria's position. I can say the president is a 
vital scholar for our Arab masses everywhere. He explained that 
Syria's strategic position is a peaceful position. Syria wants 
to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on international 
legitimacy. He pointed to the UN resolutions, particularly 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. He said Syria wants to achieve 
the peace of the brave, the peace that guarantees the end of 
Israeli occupation of all Arab territories, not just the Syrian 
Golan. He said he wants the implementation of the land for 
peace principle, Israel's withdrawal in return for peace. He 
said Syria has a lofty stand, a militant stand, a stand of pride 
and dignity. He said Syria's position is based on free Syrian 
Arab will, and that Syria will not submit to pressure from 
outside to adopt any particular position. He said: We adopt our 
stands based on our strategic vision, and on our belief in the 
Arab cause and Arab rights. 
  [Dari] You toured Damascus and some other areas. What is 
your impression of Syria and the Golan? 
  [Darawshah] Our meeting with President al-Asad; our meetings 
with the sons of our people in Syria; our tours of the Golan, 
the al-Qunaytirah Governorate, and the Damascus Governorate; our 
meetings with the brother governors; and our meetings with the 
masses of our people in markets and streets; as well as our 
meeting with the masses of our Palestinian people in the 
al-Yarmuk camp and elsewhere, have proved to us that this 
country, Syria, of which we are proud, is an oasis of freedom, 
dignity, and pride, and that all the requirements of honorable 
life are in Syria. Basic needs are available at prices that are 
cheaper than in any other state in the world. I have toured the 
world. Now, I have learned that the cheapest prices are in 
Syria. Commodities and goods are first class, very excellent. 
They are high-standard Syrian-made commodities. This conflicts 
with the propaganda campaign launched against Syria in the past, 
on the pretext that it is a police state, a state that 
suppresses freedoms, a state where Jews are persecuted, and a 
state that suffers a shortage of the basic needs. We have found 
that everything is abundant, that freedom is available, and that 
loftiness and dignity characterize every action by Syria, led by 
President Hafiz al-Asad, may God preserve him. 
  [Dari] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, you have come from the 
occupied Arab territories. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, the situation became very tense. Can you tell us your 
impression of the massacre and the Israeli army's actions 
against Palestinian Arab citizens, not only in Hebron, but also 
in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? 
  [Darawshah] We have continuous contact with the sons of our 
Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We are very 
close to them, to their feelings, and their stands. We support 
their cause and their persistent struggle to achieve freedom and 
independence and to kick out the occupation. We bless the 
valiant intifadah of the sons of our Palestinian people to get 
rid of this occupation. Based on this, every time anything 
takes place, we call upon each other and rise up to defend the 
sons of our people. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
the heinous massacre perpetrated by settlers protected by the 
Israeli army, we visited Hebron, offered condolences to the 
martyrs' families, visited the wounded in hospitals, and met 
with the masses of our people in the city of Hebron and its 
governorate. We denounced this massacre. We call on the 
Israeli Government to deter the settlers, to disarm them, and to 
deport them from Hebron, from Qiryat Arba', the accursed 
settlement, and from all settlements established in the occupied 
Arab territories. We call for international protection of the 
Palestinian people, because the Israeli occupation not only did 
not protect the Palestinian people, but also allowed the 
settlers to carry out repressive acts against the Palestinian 
people. The Israeli army itself has carried out repressive and 
suppressive acts against the sons of our Palestinian people. 
The massacre that began at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was 
continued later by the Israeli army, to the extent that the 
number of martyrs and wounded was much greater than the number 
of those killed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  [Dari] Are you trying to say the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre has confirmed the impossibility of coexistence between 
settlers and Palestinian citizens? 
  [Darawshah] There will be no coexistence under occupation. 
There will be no coexistence as long as settlements continue. 
Therefore, all the settlers must be evicted and returned to 
Israel. These settlements should be turned into homes for 
Palestinian refugees and evacuees. Let them return and take 
these settlements as their houses. This is how we can achieve 
peace. This also applies to the occupied Syrian Golan. 
Settlers there must be evicted, the Golan must be returned in 
full, and these settlements should be turned into houses for 
Syrian evacuees who return to the Syrian Golan. 
  [Dari] Thank you. [end recording]

  [Text] A delegation from the Arab Democratic Party, led by 
'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, has met with some Palestinian leaders, 
including Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Hawatimah briefed our 
radio on the meeting: 
  [Begin Hawatimah recording] The meeting reviewed the current 
situation in light of the results of the Oslo and Cairo accords. 
The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre was the bitter, dirty fruit of 
these accords, which legitimized the presence of settlements in 
Gaza and Jericho and completely ignored settlements and settlers 
in the West Bank and greater Jerusalem. 
  In light of the dialogue that took place, brother 
'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said his party completely reject the 
Cairo agreement and have some observations on the Oslo accord. 
For our part, we used clear, direct language to ask him and his 
party to reconsider their position on the Oslo accord and to not 
support this accord. We also asked him to join the opposition 
to the Rabin government, because Rabin pursues the same policy 
as Likud, but embellishes his language. The intifadah in the 
occupied territories and its expansion into Israel and along the 
Galilee, the Triangle, the Negev, and the coast indicates the 
Arab Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and 
Equality should reconsider their ties with the Rabin government. 
In addition, all democratic, leftist, and peaceful forces in 
Israel should reconsider their stands in order to annul the Oslo 
and Cairo accords and restructure the entire political, 
negotiating process within the framework of international 
resolutions. This would truly lead to full withdrawal in return 
for full peace, a full, balanced peace based on the 
establishment of a Palestinian state next to the State of 
Israel, the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, 
and resolving the problem of the refugees in line with UN 
Resolution 194. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Arab Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab </F>
Darawshah, by Sana' al-Imam in Damascus on 10 Mar--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Imam] As Israeli Arabs, 
how do you view the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Darawshah] First of all I object to such description. We 
are not Israeli Arabs. We are Palestinians and are citizens of 
the State of Israel. We are part of the Arab nation. 
Therefore, I hope Arab reporters and media would not use such 
an appellation. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Imam] Nayif Hawatimah, leader of the Democratic Front 
for 
the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said you are very 
displeased with the Cairo agreement and that you will demand 
that the Israeli Government cancel it. 
  [Darawshah] We used the phrase "having reservations." This 
is the ?(view) of Palestinians inside Israel. The majority of 
the political forces, including the Arab Democratic Party, 
welcomed the Oslo agreement as an agreement of principle, hoping 
that this would be (?followed) by a detailed agreement ensuring 
Palestinian rights. However, Israel's attempt to obtain big 
gains from the Palestinian side without offering real 
concessions made us express reservations over the Cairo 
agreement, without expressing opposition. We have reservations.

Israeli Arab delegation's visit to Damascus is an opening for 
additional visits to Syria by Israelis. Al-Shar' stressed that 
the full peace that Syria wants in return for an Israeli full 
withdrawal is the kind of peace accepted internationally by all 
states that have formal peace treaties. The Syrian foreign 
minister made the remarks to Knesset Members Wahhab 
'Abd-al-Darawshah and Talib al-Sani' and the other delegation 
members when they dined with him for the final meal of the 
Ramadan fast. Our correspondent Qaysar Kabaha, who is with the 
delegation, reports that the delegation left Damascus last night 
for Cairo and are due home this morning.

<F P=106> [Repot by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria Denies Jews Threatened"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- Syria yesterday denied the claims 
made by an American Jewish organization alleging that threats 
were made against Syrian Jews after the al-Ibrahimi mosque 
massacre on 25 February. It accused Israel of being behind such 
deceptive lies. 
  In the first comment on reports about a message received by 
Syrian Jews from sources claiming to belong to the Syrian 
Islamic Party for Justice and saying that it is permissible to 
spill Jewish blood, a Syrian official said that no such name 
exists at all. 
  He added that the claims by American Jewish organizations 
that Jews in Syria were threatened and are facing the danger of 
revenge for the Hebron massacre, and the crocodile tears shed 
for the Jews of Syria by Israel and its Jewish organizations, 
from whom the American Jewish organizations get their orders, 
are all part of the continuous attempts to confuse and cast 
doubt on the situation in Syria and on the Syrian position 
advocating a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace. 
  The Syrian official said that Israel knows very well that it 
would only reap failure and that it would never be able to 
absolve itself of the crimes it commits in broad daylight 
against Arab citizens and holy places. 
  He accused Israel of always trying to force Arab Jews to 
immigrate to it, and then committing massacres against them to 
force them to commit massacres. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
delivered Tehran Friday prayer sermons and praised the massive 
participation of the people in the international Jerusalem Day 
marches. He described it as a source of pride and honor for 
Islamic Iran. He referred to the impact of international 
Jerusalem Day in keeping alive the issue of Palestine which is 
the most fundamental issue that faces the Islamic world. He 
said: The holding of ceremonies marking international Jerusalem 
Day has an important effect on the continuation of the struggle 
of the people of Palestine. He stressed: Israel definitely will 
not last and the acceptance of any kind of peace plan with the 
regime occupying Jerusalem is suicidal. 
  The president referred to the colonial history of the 
creation of Israel and said: During World War II, world 
arrogance realized that Zionists were a threat to the European 
community and decided to create a base in the Middle East to 
achieve its inauspicious goals, and that is exactly what it did. 
Since then the Israeli policy has been to drive out Muslim 
Palestinians step by step and to usurp their lands. Apart from 
such actions, Israel has also established security zones that 
can be used as a weapon at all times. 
  The president added: The mass murder of the oppressed Muslim 
Palestinians in cases such as Dayr Yasin and the recent tragic 
event in the Abraham mosque in Hebron are among the usual 
practices of the Zionist regime. 
  The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran referred to the 
colonial nature of Israel and said: The Zionist regime cannot 
resist a second against the struggle of the Muslim nation of 
Palestine if it decides to set aside its colonial nature. It is 
for that reason that it has always enjoyed the support of 
America and Britain so as to maintain their interests in the 
region. 
  He added: The establishment of an Arab-Israeli peace does 
not 
seem logical as long as the relationship between the usurper 
Zionist regime and the Palestinian nation is one of the 
oppressor against the oppressed. The president said: 
  [Begin Rafsanjani recording] The logic of the western world 
for creating Israel is extremely faulty and vulnerable. You see 
how deceptively they are trying to make themselves look good, 
but they have come unstuck there. But Israel is so important to 
them that they are prepared to take this shame on their name to 
their grave. They are prepared to see all their claims wiped out 
for the sake of preserving that malevolent, arrogant entity, 
which is behaving this way. 
  But, will Israel last? In my opinion, no. It will 
definitely not last. That foreign body that has entered a 
living being cannot last long. 
  In my opinion, ultimately, the way to salvation is Islam. 
What can do something, keep the people on the scene, preserve 
this lengthy and hazardous crusade for a long time, is Islam. 
What one is willing to live for, die for, put up with torture, 
hunger and homelessness for, is the religious and Islamic spirit 
which we have experienced in Iran. [end recording] 
  In the first sermon Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Hashemi- 
Rafsanjani referred to the role of programs about worship, 
particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. He said the 
meaningful presence, the revolutionary and Islamic concept and 
spirit, and the revolutionary fervor of religious centers, the 
resistance against conspiracies and the continuation of 
construction was the reason for the success and strength of the 
society. 
  The interim Friday imam of Tehran added: Iran's all-round 
reconstruction, especially after eight years of holy defense, is 
the result of the self-improvement of the Muslim nation of Iran 
during this auspicious and holy period. Because people make up 
the pillars of society. If those pillars are strong and robust, 
and believe in religious principles and beliefs, undoubtedly the 
society will last. 
  In another part of his sermons the president said: Without 
the presence of earnest people on the scene to defend the 
Islamic revolution, the issues of the country, which is under 
foreign pressure from all sides, could not be advanced. We are 
in the construction period and with their ploys the enemies 
intend to dishearten us in that endeavor and bring us to our 
knees. But our nation, with the alertness which stems from that 
worship has stood against all those plots and will continue to 
do so. 
  He expressed the hope that, like the people of Iran, other 
Muslim nations of the world will find their way and fight off 
the conspiracies of world arrogance.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a speech by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani "after </F>
the second Friday sermon" in Tehran -- recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Praise be to God and peace be upon the prophet and his scion and 
upon God's pious people. On the last Friday of the blessed 
month of Ramadan and on the International Day of Jerusalem, we 
salute the memory of our late imam, who gave the jihad movement 
for liberating Palestine fresh impetus through his declaration 
of this great day. 
  This year, the heinous crime at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
awakened people, especially the Islamic nation, and their 
interest in the cause of Jerusalem, Islam's primary cause. 
Zionism exposed its alien, aggressive face. It was naive for 
some to extend a hand of friendship to the usurping invaders and 
forget the movement of jihad, which the mujahidin staged for 
years and paid with the blood of many virtuous martyrs. Those 
people left the ranks of jihad and struggle, deluding themselves 
into thinking that the Israeli leaders would grant them special 
privileges on the land of Palestine. 
  The Palestinian issue clearly demonstrates the right of the 
Muslim Palestinian people to jihad. There is no need for 
incidents like the one in Hebron for people to realize the 
intrigues of Zionism and the lies of its leaders and protectors 
when they talk about peace in the Middle East. We must warn 
those who deviated from the right path and tell them that they 
should return to the movement of jihad along with the sons of 
the Islamic nation and the valiant Palestinian people, 
consolidate the bonds of Islamic unity, and comply with what 
Islam and the Koran decided for them. They must be assured that 
there is no other way to achieve the rights of the persecuted 
Palestinian people than struggle and steadfastness. The Zionists 
and their covetous protectors will never stop their aggressive 
and expansionist spirit without the jihad of the Muslim people, 
which God promised victory and might. Peace be upon you. There 
is no help except from God. When comes the help of God and 
victory, and thou dost see the people enter God's religion in 
crowd, celebrate the praises of the lord, and pray for his 
forgiveness, for he is oft-returning in grace and mercy. 
[Koranic verses]

  [Text] Following the approval of a resolution against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran by the UN Human Rights Commission 
[UNHRC], our Foreign Ministry issued a statement today in which 
it strongly condemns the irresponsible act by the UNHRC and says 
that this resolution stems from the political intentions of the 
regime occupying Jerusalem. 
  Our Foreign Ministry's statement clarifies that the United 
States and the other mentors of Zionism who were the ringleaders 
in pushing the issuance of such a resolution have all remained 
silent on the massacre of fasting Muslims in the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque in Hebron and have even prevented the issuance of a 
resolution condemning the Zionist regime by the UN Security 
Council. Therefore, under the current conditions the Islamic 
Republic of Iran considers this resolution to be a manifestation 
of the spite of the Western-Zionist circles vis-a-vis the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's independent policies, its defiance of 
superpower domination, and especially its refusal to assist in 
imposing humiliation on the Palestinian nation. 
  It has now been proven to the world that the Western 
countries who support such resolutions have been hypocritically 
assisting in the inhuman crimes and flagrant violations of human 
rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the heart of Europe for a long 
time. 
  The statement also refers to the political and social rights 
of the minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and to the 
fact that penal codes in Iran are based on the judicial system 
of Islam accepted and respected by more than 1 billion Muslims 
throughout the world, and emphasizes that the issuance of such 
resolutions mars the credibility of such forums.

  [Text] Mr. 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Islamic 
Consultative Assembly, Majles, spoke today before the start of 
Friday prayer sermons in Tehran. He referred to the 
magnificence of the Islamic revolution in Iran and its influence 
on world Muslims. He said: By inducig a new mood in Muslims, the 
Islamic revolution of Iran has brought about a great 
transformation in the world. He added: By creating the 
cancerous cell of Israel, the enemies of Islam had intended to 
obliterate Islam from the face of the earth, in particular from 
the Middle East region. However, the people of Palestine, 
Lebanon, and the other Islamic lands, inspired by the lofty 
aspirations of Iran's Islamic revolution, have made life 
difficult for their enemies, particularly for the regime 
occupying Israel. Today we clearly witness the impact of the 
Islamic revolution on the lifestyle of these people and on the 
tactics they adopt for their struggles. 
  The Majles speaker strongly denied allegations made by the 
western mass media charging that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
physically present in the Islamic revolutionary movements of 
Egypt, Palestine, Algeria, and other Islamic countries. He 
said: What the western mass media call Iran's intervention is 
in fact the presence of the Islamic revolutionary spirit of the 
people of Iran in the hearts and minds of the nations or in 
other words it is the export of the culture of Iran's Islamic 
revolution to these countries. 
  Referring to the recent crime of the Zionist regime, he 
condemned the silence of international forums, in particular the 
United Nations and its Human Rights Commission, toward such an 
atrocity. The Majles speaker then praised the people for their 
extensive presence in the international Jerusalem Day rallies. 
He stressed: Today all the pressures exerted by arrogance with 
the aim of destroying Islam are chiefly directed against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. However, our people once again showed 
today that to safeguard and defend the values of Islam and the 
revolution, they intend to continue their struggle and remain 
steadfast in the face of all problems.

  [Text] The Pacific Ocean region and Asia, because of their 
economic and political potential, have always caught the eye of 
the West, particularly the United States. This region, while 
being important from a strategic military standpoint, has rich 
natural resources; arable lands; and an efficient, creative, and 
active work force. China is one of the most important countries 
in this region of the world. It is growing at an increasing rate 
and developing in military and economic areas with astonishing 
economic dynamism and moving towards becoming another world 
power. This situation, alongside such important economic centers 
as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, has caused the 
center of economic and strategic gravity in the world to shift 
to the Pacific Ocean area. 
  Concerning the importance of this region, 100 years ago, the 
secretary of state at the time had said: "Even though trade and 
political affairs are expanding in Europe, it will gradually 
become less important; on the other hand, the Pacific Ocean will 
become the arena of major world events in the future." Ronald 
Reagan, the former U.S. president, also said in 1984 in 
connection with the extraordinary importance of Asia and the 
Pacific Ocean region: "I look at the Pacific Ocean as the future 
of the world." 
  Because of the above-mentioned factors, the attention of the 
West and the United States has been focused on Asia and the 
Pacific Ocean more than ever before. For this reason, in 1989, a 
treaty called the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], was 
signed between the United States, Europe, and the economically 
powerful countries of Asia and the Pacific Ocean region and now 
has 17 members. 
  In the last meeting of this economic treaty, which was held 
in Azar [22 November-21 December] this year in Seattle, in the 
United States, it became clear that this region has continued to 
receive the attention of the West, and the leaders of those 
countries hope to expand their presence in that region. In this 
connection, U.S. President Bill Clinton stated in that meeting 
that the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will have a central role 
in U.S. foreign policy. He also pointed out that the Asia and 
Pacific Ocean region will be the most important political, 
economic, and military pole in the world. 
  In the opinion of political experts, the above statements 
show that the United States is determined to pursue an active 
diplomacy in that region. 
  In order to attract the attention of Chinese officials, 
prior to the meeting with the government officials of that 
country, the U.S. President ordered the sale to China of a very 
advanced super computer. 
<H5>  U.S. Reasons for Presence in Asia </H5>
  A) The U.S. economy, like the economies of European 
countries, is facing a great crisis. Economic experts have 
projected that U.S. economic growth this year and next will 
decrease by 2.7 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, and hence 
result in a wave of bankruptcy for many U.S. companies. On the 
other hand, the Pacific Ocean region, with a population of 2 
billion people, has the most rapid economic growth in the world 
and is considered a great market for American and European 
products. Hence, the increase in the U.S. economic and 
commercial presence in the region can change the market in that 
country and attract the work force in various economic sectors 
of the United States. 
  B) With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the end of 
the cold war, and the world moving toward a multipolar system, 
as the world military superpower and one of the important 
economic centers of the world, the United States is trying to 
stop the establishment of such world powers as the former Soviet 
Union, so that, so it reasons, it will become the only world 
power. Hence, under the circumstances of countries such as 
Japan, China, and Russia moving toward becoming world powers, in 
which case the Asia and Pacific Ocean region will become the 
center of gravity for world powers, in order to prevent the 
transfer of the center of power from the Atlantic Ocean to the 
Pacific Ocean, the United States is making an effort to shape 
the security and economic structure of the region before these 
countries become pivotal centers. 
  C) Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and 
especially the removal of the Berlin Wall and the reunification 
of West and East Germany, Europe is moving towards unification 
and becoming a powerful, united complex. Hence, the success of 
the Maastricht Treaty in the future will lead the Europeans 
towards a closed economic complex day by day, in which case, an 
end will be put to the presence of the United States. Under such 
circumstances, the most favorable position for the United States 
is to transfer its center of trade from Europe to Asia and the 
Pacific Ocean region. Another benefit of such a policy is that 
it will allow U.S. leaders to increase pressure on the European 
Community several times through the APEC treaty and in this way 
achieve its wishes in the GATT (tariff and trade agreement), 
which was ratified last month by the representatives of more 
than 100 countries. 
<H5>  Special Attention of the United States to China </H5>
  China, as one of the powerful countries in Asia and the 
Pacific Ocean, is of special importance. Hence, the United 
States, alongside its efforts to make its presence felt in the 
region, pays special attention to the most populated country in 
the world and in its future political and economic relations 
will allocate a special position for China. 
  In the opinion of political analysts, after the end of the 
cold war, the relations between the United States and China 
entered a new phase, which, in contrast to the past, has become 
more important at the international level. Previously, the 
Chinese tried to take advantage of the existing rivalry between 
the United States and the former Soviet Union and by 
establishing positive equilibrium between Washington and Moscow 
obtain maximum concessions from both sides. But after the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union and the final failure of 
international communism, as the leaders of new socialism, the 
Chinese, by continuing the process of reforms that they had 
started in 1976 after the death of Mao, established new 
relations with the United States and other Western countries. 
  Economically, the Chinese combined socialist ideology with 
the free-market economic system, which they call a socialist 
economic system based on the open market. Even though the nature 
of such a system is not clear to U.S. officials, because China 
has veto power in the UN Security Council, in order to have 
their proposed resolutions, which are mostly to cover up their 
meddling policies, ratified in the Security Council, the United 
States needs the vote of the Chinese Government in this council. 
  On the other hand, the economic growth of China in recent 
years has been significant, and this has been important for 
Western governments, especially the United States, that in the 
early years of the 1990's have faced economic recession. For 
this reason, Americans try to temporarily forget the issue of 
human rights, which in the past four years has been the main 
center of anti-Chinese propaganda for the Americans, in order to 
prepare the grounds for expanding relations. To this end, the 
U.S. president, a little before meeting with the government 
officials of that country, in order to appeal to Chinese 
officials, issued instructions to sell a very advanced super 
computer to China. 
  For the Chinese, who hoped to be a center of power in East 
Asia after the end of the cold war, access to advanced 
technology and attracting investments by large Western companies 
are important. For this reason, the Beijing government, on the 
one hand, tries to show itself as the defender of Third World 
countries in its relations with them and, on the other hand, due 
to the need for Western technology and investments by 
multinational companies in China, weighs political 
considerations in relation with these countries and even in some 
instances gives concessions. For example, the Chinese positive 
votes for the proposed U.S. resolution concerning Somalia, Iraq, 
Bosnia, Haiti, and the like, are precisely evaluated in the 
framework of such an objective. 
<H5>  U.S. Obstacles and Problems </H5>
  Even though all existing evidence and signs indicate the 
completion of American multilateral political and economic 
policies in the region in question, attention to hindering 
factors, which exist in this area, does not provide a clear 
perspective for the economic and political experts of the West. 
The most important of these factors are: 
  A) While the grounds for full cooperation and coordination 
between Beijing and Washington have been completely prepared, a 
sort of new rivalry is forming between the two countries. As one 
of the most powerful countries in Asia, China, even though it 
needs the West and the United States in numerous areas, is not 
prepared to become an instrument for the United States to become 
the sole world power with regard to its economic needs and at 
the same time considers itself the economic, political, and 
military rival of the United States. 
  B) The significant economic growth of the countries in the 
region has freed them from dependence on Western countries. In 
fact, the interest of those countries in more economic 
development in cooperation with the United States and Europe is 
evaluated. Hence, as soon as countries such as China and Japan 
face the oppressive actions of the United States, they are 
capable of returning to cold political relations. 
  C) The growth of nationalism and political development in 
the 
countries in the region will also confront the United States 
with problems in continuing its presence and the interference by 
Washington in the internal affairs of those countries. Even 
though countries located in Asia and the Pacific Ocean region 
have achieved significant economic advancement, this situation 
has not hindered change in the view of the Americans as regards 
the people of Eastern countries being inferior, and they 
continue to look down on the people of the East. 
  D) America's failure to understand the cultural and social 
issues of the countries in the region is another problem facing 
the United States in expanding its influence in the Pacific 
Ocean region. 
  Even though countries such as Japan and China began to move 
toward corruption and debauchery years ago and now face many 
problems in the area of the moral decline of their youth, the 
people of these countries believe in a set of cultural and 
traditional principles, and this has created a duality regarding 
the presence of U.S. forces, which makes the continuation of 
their establishment in the region problematic.

<F P=106> [by Randa Habib] </F>
  [Text] Amman, March 11 (AFP) -- Jordanian leaders blamed 
the United States Thursday [10 March] for prompting Saudi King 
Fahd to snub King Husayn during a trip to Mecca, charging that 
Washington was trying to force Jordan into signing a peace deal 
with Israel. 
  They warned that Saudi Arabia's cold reception could push 
Jordan further towards Syria -- Israel's arch Arab foe. 
  King Fahd cold-shouldered the Jordanian monarch during his 
visit, ignoring the opportunity for a reconciliation meeting. 
  It was King Husayn's first trip to Saudi since July 1990, 
just before the Gulf crisis erupted. But he cut short his visit 
Wednesday when he was ignored by Saudi authorities. 
  Relations between the two countries soured during the Gulf 
crisis when Riyadh accused Amman of backing Iraqi President 
Saddam Husayn, whose forces had invaded and occupied Kuwait. 
  Although ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been 
complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling 
families, Jordan has found itself increasingly isolated in the 
rest of Arab world since the end of the war. 
  Officially, Jordanian authorities played down the Saudi 
trip, 
saying the only purpose had been the king's pilgrimage. 
  But privately a senior Jordanian official commented: "There 
was a clear desire by the Saudis to humiliate not only the 
Hashemite family...but also the Jordanian Government." 
  And although the snub clearly came from Riyadh, Jordanian 
leaders say it was prompted by the United States, keen to step 
up pressure on Amman to sign a peace accord with Israel. 
  Israel and Jordan signed a common peace agenda in Washington 
on September 14 -- a day after the historic Israeli-PLO autonomy 
accord was agreed -- to serve as a framework for future talks 
between the two countries. 
  But several sticking points remain, notably border 
demarcations, water sharing rights and the issue of the 
Palestinian refugees who fled to Jordan in the 1967 Middle East 
war. 
  In January King Husayn held talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton during a visit to Washington discussing Jordan's debt to 
the United States, the side-effects of the UN-imposed embargo on 
Iraq for Jordan and prospects for restoring links with Saudi 
Arabia. 
  "Sign a peace treaty with Israel and all these issues will 
be 
sorted out," a senior Jordanian official, who asked to remain 
anonymous, quoted the U.S. President as saying. 
  But King Husayn has said he is anxious to avoid protracted 
negotiations, which have marked the Israeli-PLO relationship. 
The dialogue has been suspended since the February 25 Hebron 
mosque massacre. 
  Jordan remains unwelcome in other Gulf states apart from 
Oman 
and Qatar. Jordanian officials announced Thursday that King 
Husayn is to visit Qatar for the first time since February 20. 
An unconfirmed report said the visit would take place on March 
20. 
  Relations with Egypt are also cool and Amman's estrangement 
from the Palestine Liberation Organisation was revealed when PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat chose not to tell Amman of the secret 
talks with Israel which led to September's accord. 
  Officials say that as a result of Jordan's isolation it is 
being pushed closer towards Syria, in a move bound to worry U.S. 
leaders. 
  But in Jordanian political circles the message Thursday was 
that following the Saudi snub, King Husayn has even less reason 
to make conciliatory moves towards Israel.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The government was underlining the need for 
prudence in the public sector while dealing with taxpayers' 
money by ordering a flat 10 per cent cut in all "working 
expenditures" of all ministries and departments, Finance 
Minister Sami Gammuh said Monday [7 March]. 
  Mr. Gammuh, explaining a Prime Ministry order issued earlier 
this week, said the government would use the savings from the 
operational budgets of the ministries and departments to improve 
public services and productive sectors of the economy. 
  The minister said the government was hoping to save up to JD 
20 million through the ordered reductions in spending in all 
areas of current expenditure--water, electricity, transport, 
communications, stationery, etc. 
  However, he indicated that JD 20 million was not an absolute 
figure. 
  More importantly, he said, "we want to raise the awareness 
of 
everybody concerned while dealing with public funds of need to 
be careful and prudent." 
  "Everyone has to ensure that resources are spent in the 
right 
channel with optimum benefits to serve the purpose for which 
they are allocated," he told the JORDAN TIMES. 
  Mr. Gammuh said the move was also intended as a message to 
"all concerned," including ministers and senior decision-making 
officials at various departments that "there is a need for 
better management of economy" and that they should exercise 
control. 
  "Wastage has to be reduced and better utilisation of funds 
and cost-effectiveness have to be achieved in all government 
ministries and departments," he said. 
  "We know this is difficult, in view of the fact that the 
(1994) budget is already tight," Mr. Gammuh said. "But there is 
no alternative if we were to advance towards self-reliance and 
indpendence from external assistance." 
  The JD 1.487 billion fiscal budget for 1994 projects a 
shortfall of JD 158 million, expected to be addressed by 
external assistance. 
  The "operational budgets" covered under the government 
measures are estimated at nearly JD 200 million for 1994. 
  Dr. Fahid al-Fanik, an economist and newspaper columnist, 
agreed that it was "difficult to cut expenditures" but said the 
government move was "worth exploring." 
  Reducing expenditure has been adopted by the government as a 
means to cut the budget deficit for several years now, "and 
there is a limit to which one could go in reducing expenses 
before reaching the bone," Dr. al-Fanik said. 
  However, the economist said he saw room for reduction in the 
travel expenditures and allowances for government officials. 
  "I think the minister is seeking a saving of JD 10 million 
to 
JD 20 million," given the nature of expenses as given in a 
government circular issued Sunday, Dr. al-Fanik said. 
  "It will be worthwhile even if we save JD 1 million or JD 2 
million," he said. 
  The circular from the Prime Ministry defined the areas of 
reduction as water, electricity, fuel, telephone, telex, mail 
and stationery expenses. 
  It said a significant increase in expenditure was noticed in 
these areas and that it was necessary to economise in line with 
the economic restructuring programme under way in the Kingdom. 
  Mr. Gammuh said the measures to cut expenditures applied 
also 
to all public sector undertakings, including institutions such 
as the Social Security Corporation, the Jordan Investment Bureau 
and other agencies which operate directly under government 
guidance.

<F P=106> [Report by Nidal Mansur: "Security Official Reveals the </F>
Story of Explosion in Jordan; Usamah Bin-Ladin of Saudi Arabia 
Finances Bombing Operations"] 
  [Text] Despite statements by government officials affirming 
that the security forces have managed to apprehend the 
perpetrators of the explosions at the Rivoli and Salwa theaters, 
mystery continues to shroud this case which has preoccupied 
local and world public opinions. This case raises many 
questions which remain unanswered at a time when security 
circles affirm that the defendants will soon be referred to the 
State Security Court. Among the questions that remain 
unanswered are: How many defendants are involved in the bombing 
incidents? Do they belong to an organization that has programs 
and objectives? What is this organization's link to Islamic 
movements in Jordan? Does it have connections with outside 
circles for financing and support? What are the objectives that 
they are trying to achieve in Jordan? How did the security 
forces manage to reach the perpetrators of those operations? 
SHIHAN has managed to uncover and answer all of these and other 
questions. 
  A security official told SHIHAN that the explosions at the 
Rivoli and Salva theaters were not the first of their kind. The 
bombings began at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah [refugee 
camp] in 1988. The security official, who preferred to remain 
anonymous, explained his viewpoint on the details of the 
bombings. He said: The plan, which was drawn up by the 30 
defendants, most of whom received training and lived in 
Afghanistan, goes back to 1988. That is the year in which the 
explosion at the al-Yarmuk Cinema in al-Baq'ah took place. 
However, the repeated travel by their leaders to Afghanistan 
and the Philippines, and the discovery of 'Muhammad's Army', 
which carried out similar acts, prompted those individuals to 
suspend their activities in Jordan. 
  The security official continues: Some of those who returned 
from Afghanistan and who have been arrested are members of the 
Islamic Action Front Party. However, the Front had nothing to 
do with their acts. He indicated that this "organization", if 
one can call it that, is composed of two groups: The first, 
which is the smaller of the two, carried out the al-Yarmuk 
Cinema bombing in 1988. The second, includes the leaders as 
well as the first group. [as published]. 
  The security official said that 'Abdallah Kamul 
al-Hashayikah, who belongs to the Muslim Brothers, is the leader 
of this organization, and that Muhammad 'Ali Abu-'Ayyad is the 
second man in the organization. The security official revealed 
that this organization endeavors to promote the spirit of jihad 
and raises the jihad slogan through the Islamic world. It seeks 
to eliminate vileness and to strike at the dens of corruption. 
He explained that it became clear from the investigation of the 
defendants in the bombing operations that their motive was 
opposition to what they termed as capitulation. They also 
targeted theaters and liquor stores out of their belief that 
they play a vile role and should be uprooted as a religious 
duty. They believe there is no alternative to the use of force 
by bombing operations. 
  The security official indicated that the bombing scheme was 
not confined to the bombings at the Rivoli and Salva theaters. 
An explosive charge was placed in a toffee box at the 'Akrush 
stores in Safut [a village between Amman and al-Baq'ah refugee 
camp], but failed to explode. A similar charge was placed at 
the Zahran Cinema in Amman. He said that investigations 
revealed that first class hotels in Amman were also a target. 
Furthermore, the investigations revealed a plan to assassinate 
political figures in the Jordanian and Palestinian peace 
delegations. However, President Yasir 'Arafat's name was not 
among them because they could not monitor his movements, but 
they were following the movements of members of the Jordanian 
and Palestinian delegations. 
  The security official revealed that the defendants 
intensified their activities during the month of January this 
year because the main financier of their operations and plans, a 
Saudi citizen working with Usamah Bin Ladin, was planning to 
visit Jordan. The official continued to identify the financiers 
of the organization by saying that: Usamah Bin-Ladin is a 
wealthy Saudi who lives outside Saudi Arabia and is known for 
supporting extremist Islamic movements around the world. He was 
a friend of the late 'Abdallah 'Azzam, the spiritual leader of 
the Jordanian Afghans. 
  On the relationship between what took place in Jordan and 
what is taking place in Egypt, the official said the defendants 
had no links to the fundamentalist organizations that are 
responsible for bombings in Egypt. However, some of the 
defendants confessed to their admiration for what is happening 
in Egypt and Algeria. 
  He said most defendants had confessed to the charges against 
them, and that quantities of dynamite and raw materials used for 
making homemade explosives, such as acetone peroxide, a highly 
explosive material, in addition to a few pistols and machine 
guns, were discovered at their homes. He did not rule out the 
fact that other weapons may have been hidden because the arrest 
of some defendants was expected after some of their colleagues 
were arrested. 
  The security official suggested a link between this 
organization, to which he did not give a name, and Muhammad's 
Army. However, he said that there is an organizational 
interconnection, but not organizational relations between the 
two. He denied that any of the defendants in the bombings were 
members of Muhammad's Army. 
  On how the organization and the defendants were uncovered, 
the official said that the first link in the chain was defendant 
'Id al-Jahhali, who was injured in the theater explosion. At 
first, he was moved with the other injured people who were 
inside the theater. However, the forensic experts had suspicions 
about his injuries because he lost his two legs and a finger. 
Thus, when his condition, described as critical, improved, he 
was interrogated by security men. He admitted he had placed the 
explosive charge in the theater. He said he waited for a while 
before leaving to avoid suspicion, but got carried away watching 
the movie and the charge exploded under his seat. The official 
said al-Jahhalin admitted to the names of those who carried out 
the bombings with him. They were led by Muhammad 'Ali 
Abu-'Ayyad, who gave him the explosive charge and who supervised 
all the bombing operations. 
  The security official concluded by affirming that the 
judicial circles have started interrogating the defendants and 
that a charge sheet will most likely be ready in 3 weeks. He 
refused to reveal where the defendants are being detained. He 
merely said that "they are being held in an officially 
recognized prison."

  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior Jordanian 
security source has accused foreign parties of perpetrating the 
explosions that have recently occurred and continue to occur in 
Jordan, but he emphasized that these parties are neither states 
nor governments. 
  The source's statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT came after the 
discovery of five bombs in an area west of the capital Amman. 
The source said that foreign parties, now known to the security 
authorities, are behind the explosions and are linked to 
incidents which have occurred in more than one Arab country, and 
are currently providing aid for the so-called "Afghan Arabs." 
He added that the "Afghan" leader now detained and under 
interrogation with his group in Jordan is 45 years old and a 
resident of al-Baq'ah refugee camp north of Amman, and that most 
members of that organization come from that camp. 
  On the five hand grenades found by the security authorities, 
he said that they were of the U.S. M-26 type and were hidden in 
a plastic bag when they were discovered near the industrial area 
adjacent to the Civil Defense Department in the area of Bayadir 
Wadi al-Sayr west of Amman. 
  The source did not rule out the possibility that they were 
planted by "Jordanian Afghans" particularly as they were similar 
to the devices used in previous explosions. He said that a 
security commission has been formed to investigate and find out 
the source of these bombs and why they were planted in that area 
close to the Civil Defense Department building. 
  A citizen had told the security authorities that as he was 
walking around in his workshop close to the Civil Defense 
Department, he discovered the bombs in a plastic bag, and called 
in the explosives experts to defuse them.

  [Text] Deputy Dr. Muhammad 'Uwaydah has said democracy in 
our country is lame, because at a time when citizens, parties, 
and political forces deal with democracy as a reality, the 
government and its organs still have a martial law mentality. 
  He said houses continue to be stormed, arrests made, and 
some 
citizens denied employment at the orders of the security organs. 
He added that passports are withheld and various forms of 
harassment are practiced, and this radically conflicts with the 
tenets of democracy. 
  In a statement to AL-SABIL, he said the security organs 
claim 
to have arrest warrants from the general prosecutor, but in fact 
these organs have empty arrest warrant forms that do not contain 
the names of the people carrying out the arrest, the person who 
should be arrested, or even the general prosecutor. All this is 
taking place at a time when King Husayn expresses eagerness to 
maintain democracy and says democracy is an irrevocable option. 
  Dr. 'Uwaydah recalled that King Husayn recently said, in an 
address to the House of Representatives, that he wants the 
Jordanian and Arab citizens to feel that they are human beings. 
Deputy 'Uwaydah asked: How can all these practices be 
described? 
  Dr. 'Uwaydah witnessed the arrest and search of the house of 
Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Diyyah, secretary of the Islamic Action 
Front's branch in Suwaylih. He said he saw with his eyes an 
empty arrest warrant after he asked to read Diyyah's arrest 
warrant. He said he saw a security man filling out the arrest 
warrant. 
  Dr. 'Uwaydah said political parties and forces are not 
immune 
from the official organs' pursuit. He asked: What is the 
meaning of seizing books and leaflets that belong to the Muslim 
Brotherhood taken from Diyyah's house? 
  He added that if a citizen is brought to account for having 
a 
book that is available in the market and that is approved by the 
publication authorities, and if that book deals with a group 
that is officially licensed, then what liberties are left?

  [Excerpts] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Marwan Dudin, 
member of the Jordanian delegation to the bilateral peace 
negotiations with Israel, has revealed that there are clear 
differences of opinion between the Jordanians and the Israelis 
regarding the negotiations. He said: They talk to us as if 
peace has already been achieved. 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Dudin said that the 
Israeli negotiators' method of negotiation is completely 
different from the Jordanian method, for whereas the Jordanians 
are looking for a clear way of establishing a just, lasting, and 
durable peace on the basis of the specific Jordanian and Arab 
constant principles pertaining to the entire peace process, the 
Israelis are following a completely different approach and 
talking about matters and issues which are supposed to be 
discussed in detail after full and comprehensive agreement is 
reached on the main issues on the agenda of the 
Jordanian-Israeli negotiation track, the same as on other tracks. 
  Dudin, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT after returning 
to Amman with the other members of the Jordanian delegation to 
the negoatiations, said: We believe that there is a clear and 
specific agenda including major issues which should be 
negotiated in depth. If we cannot reach full agreement on them, 
the peace we aspire to and work for sincerely and with open 
minds, will not be achieved. 
  He said that their method of negotiation is basically 
focused 
on what they call "Israel's security" irrespective of reaching 
agreement on the issues on which specific agreements must be 
reached. 
  The members of the Jordanian delegation had returned to 
Amman 
in implementation of the decision of the Arab parties to the 
peace process to suspend the negotiations temporarily following 
the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. Dudin said: To 
us, the topics on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda are of paramount 
importance. We well understand that it would be illogical to 
discuss very advanced issues that are supposed to come as a 
result of the peace process or of the peace agreements, before a 
comprehensive agreement is reached on solutions for the main 
issues still unresolved.... We are talking about the issues of 
water and our right to it, the occupied Jordanian territory, and 
return of the refugees. We cannot imagine any possibility of 
signing a peace agreement or moving on to other details which, 
in our view and in the view of the entire international 
community, would be results of the peace agreement, before clear 
and acceptable agreements are reached on all these issues. 
  Dudin also said: I believe that there is no agreement so far 
between the Jordanian and Israeli views. The Israelis are using 
a negotiating language and approach only to serve their own 
interests without any clear inclination so far to discuss the 
main issues on the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. For instance, they 
say why should we not talk about tourism and combating natural 
disasters, why should we not be allowed to visit Petra, and why 
should we not discuss commercial issues, for your trade is going 
to be with us and not with the Palestinians, and other such 
issues which could only be tackled at later stages and can only 
be discussed after peace is actually established through 
agreement on the fundamental issues and topics, the most 
important being water, and our full undiminished rights to it 
must be fulfilled, our occupied territory where full Jordanian 
sovereignty must be restored, and the issue of the refugee 
problem which must be radically solved. 
  Dudin added: All I can say is that, in the negotiations, we 
expressed our views strongly on the various issues and we told 
them that all the matters they have been raising would come 
after the establishment of a comprehensive, just, and durable 
peace acceptable to us and to future generations. [passage 
omitted] 
  Dudin further said: The negotiations are clearly at a 
standstill now because of our different philosophies. We say 
that we will not sign any peace agreement before full agreement 
is reached on the issues on the agenda, but they clearly 
concentrate on matters that would arise later on and that, in 
our view, cannot be discussed before the main pending issues are 
resolved. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Independent Russian Initiative"] </F>
  [Text] After a long sleep, and an almost complete absence 
from the theater of international politics, particularly in this 
part of the world, Russian diplomacy has begun the first move of 
its kind concerning the Middle East. The Russian foreign 
minister is scheduled to arrive in Tunis today within the 
framework of a mission that will also take him to Israel, with 
the objective of reactivating the peace process which has been 
suspended following the heinous Hebron massacre. 
  It seems that the Russian move is based on an initiative 
that 
is independent from the U.S. moves in the region. It also seems 
that this move goes beyond the U.S. stand which in full harmony 
with the Israeli stand. This Russian move is aimed at 
reassessing the current situation in the Middle East 
approximately 28 months after the outset of the current peace 
process at the Madrid conference. 
  Perhaps the focal point in the declared Russian initiative 
is 
based on reconvening the Madrid conference in light of a host of 
changes that have occurred in the Middle East in these long 
months, and based on a series of facts which were revealed by 
the peace negotiations, and which were not assessed objectively 
prior to the convening of the Madrid conference in October 1991. 
  Since these changes and the series of facts, revealed by the 
peace talks over the past months, were not fully in harmony with 
the Israeli stand and with the objectives of the peace process 
placed by the Americans, the initial Israeli reaction opposed 
this initiative. Also, the initial U.S. reactions did not 
welcome this independent Russian initiative, the first since the 
end of the cold war. 
  In light of all this, we welcome this timely Russian move 
aimed to launch the deadlocked peace process. We also support a 
process to reassess the peace process by one of the cosponsors 
who has been far away from the political arena in this region 
for a long time. 
  We believe that the Russian foreign minister's mission is 
evidence that the involved parties have not accepted the 
unilateral sponsorship of the deadlocked peace process, 
particularly since the American sponsor has shown a lack of 
fairness and objectivity, if not complete bias toward the 
Israeli view.

<F P=106> ["Last Station" Column by Salih al-Qallab: "United States </F>
Taking Sides Again"] 
  [Text] Obviously, the U.S. attitude toward the struggle in 
the region is still unchanged. Certainly, the Hebron massacre, 
which drew reactions from and shocked the entire world, has not 
made Bill Clinton or his staff bat an eyelash. Nor has this 
prompted them to change, even slightly, their country's policy 
from that of Israel. 
  The latest reports on this subject indicates Washington told 
the Palestinian leadership that it should resolve its problems 
with Israel directly and without any intervention from any other 
party, that the discussion of the issue of sending international 
protection forces to Gaza and Jericho--and only to Gaza and 
Jericho--will be held only within the Israeli-Palestinian 
meetings and within the framework of the Oslo agreement. 
  Thus, the United States proves once again that it is blindly 
taking sides with Israeli governments hawks, that it does not 
care for Arab and Islamic sentiments that appeared as reactions 
to the Hebron massacre, that it insists on hurting the feelings 
of Arabs and Muslims and imposes itself by force on Israel's 
side as an antagonist of all peoples in the region. 
  Immediately following the massacre, President Bill Clinton 
addressed an appeal to transfer the Israeli-Palestinian talks to 
Washington. The PLO immediately accepted the invitation. Now 
the U.S. Administration is taking issues back to square one. It 
is insisting that the issue of international protection for the 
inhabitants of the occupied territory can only be solved between 
the PLO and Israel and within the Oslo agreement. 
  In view of the blood shed by Israeli terrorism at the 
Ibrahimi Mosque, the world is now convinced that real protection 
for the Palestinian people under occupation must be provided. 
However, the United States continues to turn a cold shoulder to 
logic and to insist that every Arab and Muslim everywhere must 
continue to feel that his actual and definite enemy is the 
United States and not the Israeli state. 
  Why does the United States reject effective protection for 
the Palestinian people under occupation and insist on spiking 
the wheels, when even some Israeli cabinet members support 
providing such protection and for removing settlements from the 
West Bank and Gaza? 
  When it takes a hostile stand that rejects the facts of 
history and reality, the United States should not be surprised 
if the current that opposes it and its interests intensifies in 
the region and throughout the Arab and Islamic worlds as well. 
It should not be surprised at what will happen in the future. 
People are collections of feelings and sentiments. When their 
feelings are hurt their reaction will, by and large, be 
spontaneous and without thought or discretion.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Two Weeks After the Massacre"] </F>
  [Text] Two weeks have passed since the odious massacre at 
the Ibrahimi mosque. Yet, no signs have appeared of any Israeli 
or U.S. moves to reopen the road to peace, which the 
perpetrators of the massacre have blocked with blood and fire. 
  Provided with U.S. political cover at the UN Security 
Council, the Israeli Government seems to be shirking its 
responsibility as an occupying force. According to the Fourth 
Geneva Convention, Israel must protect civilians in wartime. 
However, the Israeli Government continues its terrorist policy, 
without showing the least respect for human rights. 
  Instead of encouraging the Rabin government to assume its 
full responsibilities toward this terrible crime, the United 
States for two weeks has hampered any move by the UN Security 
Council to issue a resolution providing for the validity of the 
Fourth Geneva Convention in the occupied Palestinian territory 
and securing protection for the Palestinian people. 
  In view of this Israeli arrogance and the flagrant U.S. bias 
toward the Yitzhaq Rabin government, the Arab side looks like a 
weak, wounded body watching what is taking place at the UN 
Security Council, unable to move or even to express pain as a 
result of the ceaseless knifing of his flesh. 
  Having seen the odious massacre in Hebron and the subsequent 
killings of scores of youths, children, and women in the 
occupied territories, we are still both panicked and unable to 
respond to the challenge that has been posed by the spilled 
blood. Two weeks after the massacre, we see an Arab and Islamic 
world full of signs that call for regret, sadness, and pity. 
  Vis-a-vis all that, it is not ruled out that this 
Arab-Islamic submissiveness and the spiteful U.S. bias toward 
Israel will encourage the ultra-Zionist extremists to commit 
something more horrible than the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, so 
long as murderers and criminals can avoid accountability, not to 
mention punishment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "So That Others May Respect Us!"] </F>
  [Text] It seems that no one in this world pays attention 
to us, as a nation, anymore. This is because we are always 
subjected to humiliation and annihilation and to looting and 
killing whenever others wish to express their grudge and hatred 
against us. The Ramadan massacre [in Hebron] was retained in 
memory no longer than 10 days. The West, led by the United 
States, believed that this massacre did not deserve to be 
remembered longer. Hence, this is an opportunity to examine 
international legitimacy. Others disregard this legitimacy 
while asking us to honor it. Others despise this legitimacy 
while asking us to appreciate it. They then hide their faces, 
so we cannot see their sarcastic laughter at the peoples and 
nations which still pin hopes on international legitimacy. 
  The slaughter of more than 50 Palestinians in one of the 
holiest Muslim mosques is an example of what has become daily 
acts committed by the West or Israeli racism. We are only left 
with appealing to the world to protect us and send us--and 
perhaps at our expense-- witnesses to our humiliating death. 
This is so because we do not want to reconsider our position 
even on a single occasion which would express our courage and 
prove that we can do something. Those who have expressed much 
grief over the Palestinian people must reconsider their 
position. The Palestinian people need our support not our 
support for others against them. Now that grief has been 
expressed out of pan-Arab considerations, we would like to 
recall the fact, though seldom beneficial, that the Iraqi people 
are an Arab people, that hundreds of Iraqi children are starving 
to death, and that hundreds of ailing Iraqis pass away everyday 
because we, and not others, are the ones who are besieging Iraq 
by the false international legitimacy which is slaughtering the 
Iraqis and protecting both the occupation troops and settlers in 
Palestine. 
  While we recall this catastrophe, the U.S. Administration 
reiterates its known tone that Iraq still violates international 
legitimacy and has not yet complied fully with its resolutions. 
This tone seeks to prevent the Security Council from lifting the 
embargo on Iraq's oil exports. These exports would enable Iraq 
to purchase milk for its children, medicines for its patients, 
pencils for its students, water colors for its painters, and 
some serenity and reassurance for its old people who have faced 
much U.S. intimidation since August 1990. 
  For us to stand alongside the Palestinian people against the 
settler murderers, and to support the Ibrahimi Mosque and stand 
against all the Zionist, U.S., and Western arsenals, and also to 
back the brother against the enemy, the path is clear; namely, 
Arabs should end the blockade they are imposing against the 
Iraqi people. Only by doing this will we confirm that we are 
still Arabs who can have make their own decisions and who 
freely, independently, and courageously pursue their policies, 
so others would be compelled to respect us and honor the 
international legitimacy in whose name and under whose banner we 
are being slaughtered and humiliated!

<F P=106> [Editorial by the chief editor: "Democracy, O Your Majesty </F>
the King!"] 
  [Text] King Husayn has always spoken warmly about the 
freedom, dignity, and pride of the Jordanians, who only bow to 
Almighty God. The king was not satisfied with this, so he 
decided -- as he stressed in his address to the deputies 
recently -- to return democracy to the country. Within a few 
years, democratic institutions were set up, the National Charter 
was adopted by the influential political forces in Jordan, 
democratic laws were enacted, martial laws were abolished, and 
public liberties were launched. All this was accompanied by 
intensive royal calls for safeguarding the human rights of the 
Jordanians as a prelude to setting up a Jordanian democratic 
example in the entire Arab region. The objective of King Husayn 
is -- as he himself reiterated in his address to the most 
important democratic institution in the country, the Parliament 
-- to make the Jordanians in particular, and the Arabs in 
general, feel that they are no less great than the other free 
peoples of the world. 
  It would be fair to say that the citizens in Jordan have 
enjoyed an atmosphere of openness, frankness, and freedom the 
likes of which do not exist in the entire Arab region. However, 
we also must be fair and say that some officials are still 
incapable of democratizing their mind, behavior, and way of 
practicing their powers. We are now witnessing a kind of 
retreat on the issue of human rights in Jordan. Deputies, 
writers, and officials have admitted that the whole 
democratization process will be endangered if the decisionmakers 
do not take the initiative and adopt immediate measures to 
safeguard the king's decision, to save it from the tampering of 
those who are committing undemocratic violations, whether with 
good or bad intentions. We, as journalists, are aware of the 
long list of these violations. The masses, who know some of 
these violations, sometimes file complaints, while other times 
leaving the matter to God. 
  The strange thing is that most of the violations of human 
rights in Jordan are committed in the name of the law under the 
pretext of maintaining security. In other words, the citizen's 
security is undermined and his dignity is rubbed in the dirt to 
maintain security, as happened a few days ago in al-Baq'ah Camp, 
where innocent citizens were forced to lay down on the ground 
and were insulted and treated badly. When the deputies of the 
Islamic Action Front [IAF] brought the matter to the prime 
minister, in his capacity the head of the executive branch, he 
said that this incident is an individual and separate one, 
expressed his regret at such incidents, and promised to follow 
it up. 
  In another incident, Engineer 'Abd-al-Majid Dayyah, 
secretary 
of the IAF branch in Suwaylih, was arrested under strange 
circumstances. The people who carried out the arrests presented 
a memorandum signed by the public prosecutor but with no names 
in it. When Deputy Muhammad 'Uwaydah, who was present during the 
arrest, expressed his astonishment at such behavior, the person 
in charge of the arrest filled in the form in front of the 
deputy. 
  In another incident, a youth was arrested because he was 
carrying leaflets issued by the Muslim Brotherhood, which is a 
legal group as we know, and was placed in custody with suspects 
in immoral cases and criminals. This youth was released after 
spending a terrible night with those people, who insulted him. 
And the list of such examples is long. Certain citizens are 
still banned from employment in accordance with the instructions 
of the security forces. We also still hear about the 
confiscation of passports, unfounded arrests, investigations, 
and other practices that prevailed under the martial law. 
  Such incidents -- even if they are few compared with what 
took place under the martial law -- should sound the alarm. The 
royal decision is very clear, and the executive and judicial 
branches are charged by the king's designation letter to carry 
out all of the king's instructions. If these branches are 
incapable of carrying out these instructions, then they must 
step down immediately and resign because they are not faithful 
to the interests of the people and are incapable of carrying out 
the leadership's decisions. And if they do not want to carry 
out the king's instructions, this is even more serious because 
they will be declaring their rebellion and mutiny, God forbid. 
This has never occurred in the history of Jordan. Our 
contemporary history has never registered a government that 
refused to implement the throne's instructions. 
  The citizens seek to entrench free democratic life and to 
live under laws that ensure fair trials for suspects. However, 
the citizens are now living in a state of confusion and anxiety. 
This state can only end if we remove the gap between the 
desires and instructions of King Husayn on one hand and the 
practices of the executive branch on the other. If laws are not 
implemented in a legal way our democratic march will be 
threatened. 
  No honest citizen will call for freeing criminals from the 
penalty stipulated by law, but the trials of those people must 
be fair and their arrests must be under humane circumstances. 
King Husayn does not accept fabricated accusations or that 
injustice and insults can be practiced against his people.

  [Text] Beirut, March 10 (AFP)--The army surrounded the 
headquarters of the former Christian Lebanese Forces (LF) 
militia on Thursday, LF leader Samir Ja'ja' said. 
  Ja'ja' told AFP on the telephone that around 100 soldiers 
were deployed around the militia's fortified headquarters in 
Ghidras, north of Beirut, where he also lives, for no apparent 
reason. 
  "One unit took up position outside one of the three 
entrances 
to the building and began searching people going in and out," he 
said. 
  "About 30 minutes later a second unit was posted outside the 
second entrance and then a third group of soldiers demanded to 
go inside the building but my bodyguards prevented them," he 
added. 
  The building was still surrounded several hours later. 
  "I don't know the reason for these measures. There has been 
no incident," Ja'ja' added. 
  Last month, he said that the Syrian-backed Lebanese 
government was to blame for a bomb attack in a church on 
February 27 that killed nine people and wounded 55 others. 
  "The Lebanese government is responsible for this crime. It 
is the duty of the state to protect its citizens," he said. 
  "The Lebanese people have been greatly deceived because they 
have realised that the security the authorities promised to 
restore is still a mirage," complained Ja'ja'. 
  His militia was disbanded along with others after Lebanon's 
1975-1990 war.

  [Text] Here is a flash just in from the news desk -- a 
military source has stated the following: 
  A local media organ this afternoon carried a report saying 
that Army units are surrounding the headquarters of the Lebanese 
Forces [LF] in Ghidras. This report is inaccurate and untrue. 
We would like to clarify that the Army's recent movements in 
the Kasrawan area are part of a field plan to consolidate 
security in the region following several incidents and rumors 
that have caused concern among the citizens. The security 
source assures the public that the security situation is stable, 
despite some incidents that seek to undermine the morale of the 
citizens. The security agencies are looking into these 
incidents to uncover those behind them.

  [Excerpts] At a news conference, Lebanese Forces [LF] 
Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' explained to the public the 
circumstances surrounding what happened in Ghidras. He affirmed 
that such measures will not change the stands of the party 
leadership, which are firm stands over which there can be no 
bargaining or pressure. Ja'ja' reminded political and judicial 
authorities of their responsibilities. 
  Dr. Samir Ja'ja' affirmed that what is happening has nothing 
to do with the measures the state is taking. He pointed out 
that regrettably the state is doing things that harm Lebanon and 
hamper its progress. He described this new development as a 
mere tightening of the noose round the neck of the LF 
headquarters in Ghidras. He clarified that neither laws, nor 
regulations, nor the Constitution stipulate that journalists are 
banned from entering Ghidras or bringing in the necessary 
equipment they need to cover an event. This [the government 
action] is not acceptable. If there are any political 
authorities in the country, they should allow this. If there 
are any judicial authorities, then all such measures should be 
decreed by these authorities. Let us listen to part of what Dr. 
Ja'ja' said in his news conference which he held last night in 
Ghidras. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Ja'ja' recording] [passage omitted] I very much 
regret that the Lebanese authorities, which are our authorities, 
behave in a manner that strips them of all credibility. This is 
something that hurts and pains us. These authorities' behavior 
shows that they have no self-respect. Our hopes and 
expectations are to have authorities respected by everyone 
inside and outside the country, but first they should have 
self-respect. It is unfortunate for the state to be at a stage 
or time where it allows itself everything, dodges all laws, 
leaks information, creates news, provides the explanations it 
likes, ignores facts, deduces and creates things that are not 
there. It is regrettable that a state would do so. [passage 
omitted] 
  The authorities cannot be this [word indistinct]. I will 
ignore what has been said, such as statements that these 
measures fall within the security arrangements. I do not 
understand what security arrangements stipulate that a military 
presence should be deployed at the four entrances of a house 
that lead only to it. What we are certain of is that we shall 
stand firm regarding our stand. If some sides think that they 
will be able to change our stand through their behavior they are 
very wrong. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed 
that the state is losing its final shreds of credibility, which 
it could have nurtured to its advantage, without achieving 
anything. It is widening the gap between itself and its people. 
This is undesirable and achieves nothing. He clarified that 
the state is destroying itself through such behavior. [passage 
omitted] 
  Before the news conference he held in Ghidras, Dr. Ja'ja' 
asked all citizens and his supporters in various parts of 
Lebanon not to react to these government measures and to remain 
calm.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi this afternoon received 
General Mustafa Talas, Syrian deputy prime minister and minister 
of defense, who led a Syrian delegation that included Gen. 'Ali 
Aslan, deputy chief of staff; Major General Ibrahim Safi, 
commander of the Syrian Arab forces operating in Lebanon; and 
Staff Brigadier General Ghazi Kan'an, chairman of the security 
and reconnaissance apparatus branch in the Syrian Arab Forces 
operating in Lebanon. The delegation came to offer condolences 
to President al-Hirawi on the death of his sister. 
  The Syrian delegation later met with Defense Minister Muhsin 
Dallul, who pointed out that they discussed general issues. 
Responding to a question, Dallul said that there are attempts to 
terrify the people. He denied any negligence on the part of the 
security agencies, calling on the people to refrain from 
questioning the efficiency of security and judiciary apparatuses 
and for giving them the chance to do their duty. 
  The Syrian delegation then visited Army Commander General 
Emile Lahhud and reviewed military issues and coordination 
between the two fraternal armies. Intelligence chief Colonel 
Michel Rahbani and his assistant, Col. Jamil al-Sayyid, attended 
the meeting.

  [Text] Before we get into details of the news, we would 
like to note a new Israeli move that falls in the context of the 
continuous defiance and provocations the Hebrew state indulges 
in against Lebanese sovereignty. 
  The enemy's prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, today toured the 
occupied border region. He met in Marj 'Uyun barracks with 
Antoine Lahd, commander of the agent militia, and a number of 
his military commanders. 
  Radio Voice of the South, the mouthpiece of Lahd's South 
Lebanese Army, carried a statement by Rabin in which he 
insinuated that peace with Lebanon will come after the 
resistance is eliminated, particularly Hizballah; after the 
Lebanese Government proves its ability to maintain security 
north of the border area for six months; and after the soldiers 
and officers of Lahd's militia are absorbed in the Lebanese 
Army, as Rabin put it.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz followed by a </F>
question-and-answer-session with unidentified correspondents at 
the Foreign Ministry on 10 March; broadcast in 
progress--recorded] 
  [Text] [Buwayz] ...the attempt to implement the 
Gaza-Jericho Agreement and what has followed continue in the 
south and in the country's interior. I say very simply and 
frankly that there are repeated attempts to destabilize the 
internal situation with the aim of forcing Lebanon to attend the 
negotiations from a weak position. This requires us to respond 
to this provocation with more internal and national cohesion. 
  [Correspondent] Minister, you received this week the 
Lebanese 
negotiating delegation members who reported to you on the 
negotiations and talks held in Washington. Can you tell us if 
there has been progress on the Lebanese track? 
  [Buwayz] It is clear from the latest round held in 
Washington 
that Israel's desire to make progress was almost nonexistent. 
It was evident that the Israeli Government was not ready to 
apply the principles of the Geneva summit between President 
Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. This gives the 
impression and makes it clear that there was a determined 
decision to foil this round or ensure its failure. 
Additionally, we feel there is not yet readiness within Israel 
to achieve progress, something that is possibly due to the 
domestic situation in Israel. In any case, there are 
U.S.-Israeli contacts that are supposed to activate things. 
Some U.S.-Arab contacts are also expected with the aim of 
finding a way out that would restore substance to the 
negotiations. 
  [Correspondent] Has the United States asked Lebanon to 
rescind its decision to suspend the negotiations? What are the 
conditions for doing so? 
  [Buwayz] Negotiations are not an issue of formalities. 
Formalities, the timing of the round, and the way invitations 
are sent out to attend the rounds are not the bases for the 
negotiations. The basis remains Israel's ability and its 
decision to achieve progress. For several reasons, we do not 
feel that Israel has decided it wants to achieve progress. 
  [Correspondent] What did you discuss with the secretary 
general of the Higher Lebanese-Syrian Council? 
  [Buwayz] Lebanese-Syrian relations are not outside the 
framework of this regional situation. It is normal for us to 
discuss the regional developments that are of interest to the 
secretary general of the Higher Council. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding the peace negotiations, what is 
your stance on the Russian positions that yesterday announced 
the death of the peace negotiations and called for a new 
international conference. Regarding security, many 
denunciations were made and the state was asked to take strong 
measures to prevent bombings. Is there anything new? 
  [Buwayz] Of course. The Lebanese state must perform all its 
duties, now more than ever, in controlling and monitoring 
security. Citizens should also realize that there is a 
premeditated provocation aiming to provoke a particular sector 
of the Lebanese people to create reactions that will play a 
principal role in undermining internal cohesion and solidarity. 
It is no coincidence that the Kasrawan area was the direct 
target. The reason for targeting it is clear. The targeting of 
a church and the French Cultural Center were no coincidence 
either. All these developments should clearly make us realize 
that there is an attempt to provoke. We should not be trapped by 
it. The state must thwart these attempts through its security 
organs and the Lebanese people, who have experienced war and 
know that things should be more cohesive than ever.

  [Text] Cairo, 10 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Croatian Ambassador 
Danijel Bucan. 
  After the meeting Bucan said that he discussed with Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid the agreement concluded by Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
Muslims and Croats to establish a confederal union with Croatia 
so that the Muslim-Croatian "canton" would become an independent 
state, but at the same time linked to Croatia in matters of 
joint defense, markets, and a customs union. 
  He added that he sensed during his talks with Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid that the latter shares his view that the agreement 
is essential to a peaceful solution of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the general crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Croatian ambassador said he expects the agreement to 
succeed in view of the longstanding friendship between Muslims 
and Catholics in that region. He referred to the existence of a 
mosque and Islamic center in Croatia. 
  Bucan said he hopes Russia will play a positive role in 
ensuring the agreement's success.

  [Text] Under the patronage of President Saddam Husayn, the 
Kurdish autonomy institutions held a celebration today at the 
National Theater on the 24th anniversary of the historic 11 
March Statement. The celebration was held under the slogan 
"Arabs and Kurds: One Hand in Defense of Great Iraq." 
  Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, member of the Revolution 
Command Council and representative of the president of the 
republic, delivered a speech at the celebration. At the outset, 
he conveyed greetings from leader President Saddam Husayn, may 
God watch over him, to the attendees, wishing them continued 
success. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan added: On this day, 24 years ago, the 
glorious 17-30 July revolution made an important national 
achievement by issuing the historic 11 March Statement to 
resolve the Kurdish question peacefully and democratically. 
This solution was meant to serve as a strong and broad basis 
for Iraqi national unity between Arabs and Kurds. The solution 
was also an embodiment of the true principles of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party and the policy of the glorious 17-30 July 
revolution, as well as its true, sincere belief in the 
legitimate rights of other ethnic groups under the greater 
umbrella of Iraq and the unity of its land and people. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan added: The Iraqis -- Arabs and Kurds -- 
warmly welcomed the historic 11 March statement. They were 
aware of the great objectives and noble meanings behind this 
statement of national unity. The leader president put an end to 
the fighting among brothers, the sons of one nation. On the 
achievement of the great objectives of the 11 March Statement, 
people all over Iraq held big celebrations, from the farthest 
village in southern Iraq to the farthest village in northern 
Iraq. Men and women, youth and children, all took part in these 
celebrations to express their true joy over this great victory 
by leader President Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him. 
  He went on: In the glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [war with 
Iran], our Kurdish people were the faithful guards and brave 
defenders of their great Iraq in the north, center, and south, 
whether with the Armed Forces or the sectors of the People's 
Army. During the war, the Kurdish people acted as an impregnable 
bulwark in the face of the Iranian aggressors and the agents who 
tried more than once to mislead them, divest them of their true 
Iraqi character, and urge them to change their strong allegiance 
to the unified, independent Iraq of Arabs and Kurds. Also, 
during the immortal Mother of Battles, the sons of our Kurdish 
people demonstrated an honorable stand, just like the free 
Iraqis, by holding fast in the face of a fierce 30-state 
aggression. They also resisted tonnes of bombs and missiles 
dropped and fired by the aggressors against their installations, 
schools, homes, and mosques. The 30-state coalition and its 
agents were alarmed by this great Iraqi cohesion. Thus, they 
initiated a second episode of treason and treachery, assigning 
it to small agents, who inherited treason and agentry from their 
fathers, the large agents. They tried to mislead the sons of 
our Kurdish people by using slogans whose falsity became clearer 
day after day. The agents sought, with U.S., French, and 
British spears, to divide Iraq and separate its north from its 
center and south. Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani, the two 
traitors, and their gangs donated the land of our beloved north 
to serve as a den for Zionists, Americans, and their allies, 
paying no heed to their oppression of our Kurdish people, who 
adhere to their revolutionary leadership and who live under the 
shade of Iraq's big umbrella and the 17-30 July revolution. The 
Kurdish people have known the sweet taste of the revolution and 
reaped its fruits and gains; primarily peace, security, and 
prosperity. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan added: After many meetings, with 
flexibility and goodwill to resolve problems through 
constructive dialogue based on full national unity, the 
leadership is now convinced that the leaders of those cliques 
are agents of the foreigner and care only about their personal 
interests and those of their masters. Those agents are using 
the Kurdish question to achieve gains. They cannot live in 
peace, security, and national unity because they have grown 
accustomed to living on the crumbs and leftovers of foreigners. 
They have also grown accustomed to a life of humiliation, 
subservience, and slavery to satisfy the colonialist policy of 
their masters and their rotten personal whims that reject 
dignity, freedom, and national unity. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan asserted: Our great Kurdish people, who 
have, since time immemorial, adhered to Iraq -- in terms of its 
land, people, history, civilization, and brotherhood with the 
Arabs of Iraq -- will rise and rebel against this agent clique. 
The 36th parallel will be shattered by the Kurds of Iraq, just 
as the Arabs of Iraq shattered the 32d parallel. All attempts 
at temptation and deception will not fool the sons of our 
Kurdish people, who are suffering under foreign occupation, the 
domination of agent cliques, poverty, hunger, and lack of 
security. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan concluded: All methods of deception, 
falsification, and allegations are short lived, no matter how 
long they persist. All these methods will be exposed as the 
days go by. Our beloved north will return shortly to the mother 
homeland and the greater umbrella. National unity will be 
restored to great Iraq, in terms of the land and people, from 
its north to its south. The policies of agentry, treason, and 
subservience will be defeated so Iraqis will continue to live 
under the aegis of the wise, prudent leadership of the symbol 
leader, Saddam Husayn, may God watch over him. Tomorrow is not 
far off for those awaiting it. Glad tidings for those who 
patiently persevere. [Koranic verse] 
  Afterward, Baha'-al-Din Ahmad, speaker of the Legislative 
Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, made a speech in 
which he asserted that the Kurdish people will intensify their 
struggle to return to the state of law and order, which is 
lacking under the agent, sabotage cliques sitting in the lap of 
their foreign masters. Those cliques have turned the Kurdistan 
paradise into a hell of death and destruction. 
  Ahmad Muhammad Sa'id al-Atrushi, secretary of the Kurdistan 
Democratic Party, also made a speech. He underlined the current 
looting of resources and the unjust control of the Kurdish 
people's means of livelihood in the Kurdistan region. This is 
happening under false slogans that do not deceive our Kurdish 
people and honorable figures worldwide. He said the actions of 
the agent, traitorous cliques have exposed their intentions and 
shown their true colors and their miserable situation. 
  Afterward, Majid Rashid al-Zibari, secretary of the 
Kurdistan 
Revolutionary Party, made a speech. He said the autonomy of the 
Kurdistan region and the national rights achieved for the 
Kurdish people are among the major reasons for the plots of 
hostile, evil forces, which persistently seek to undermine 
Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its people and pure land. 
  The celebration was attended by comrade 'Abd-al-Rahman Ahmad 
'Abd-al-Rahman, member of the Iraq Command and official in 
charge of the Ninawa and Dahuk organizations of the Arab 
Socialist Ba'th Party; Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim al-Barzanji, 
chairman of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region; as well as the council's secretaries general; several 
members of the Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region; and a large audience.

  [Excerpts] President Hafiz al-Asad yesterday received a 
delegation of the 1948 Palestinians led by 'Abd-al-Wahhab 
Darawshah, who are in Damascus to offer condolences on the 
nation's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil al-Asad. 
[passage omitted] 
  Delegation member Talab al-Sani' made a speech in which he 
said: At the outset of my speech I would like to say that this 
delegation represents all of Palestine, from the Galilee, the 
triangle, and the Arab Negev. This delegation includes people 
from Yafo, 'Akko, and Haifa. This shows they are a vital part 
of the Arab nation. Every day they experience attempts to 
uproot them from their land. But, they are standing fast on 
their Arab land. We always say we are part of the Arab nation. 
We are proud of our Arab identity. We are ready to pay the 
price. A week ago, after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, 
there was a massive uprising inside 1948 Palestine. A youth 
from the Negev city of Rahat was also martyred. Tens of people 
were wounded. This shows these people are a vital part of the 
Arab nation, despite political boundaries and the political 
siege imposed on us. We have not forgotten our affiliation. 
Neither have we knelt down or bowed our heads. 
  Your Excellency, I would like to say that in addition to 
what 
my brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said, that Syria's position, 
your wise position at the Geneva summit, has put the Israeli 
Government in a corner, in a defensive position, because they 
have always used Israel's security as a pretext, as if security 
is only for one side and that the other parties and states have 
no security. We believe the occupier is Israel, that the 
aggressor is Israel, and that the side carrying out repressive 
and oppressive measures in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is 
Israel. 
  Israel will not be able to use its powerful media to 
propagate its claims that the Arab world and the Arab states 
threaten Israel's security. Your wise position advocating full 
withdrawal for complete peace has put Israel and the Israeli 
Government into a corner. The Israeli Government is trying to 
find a way out of this impasse with weak justifications. The 
world knows, the Israeli Government knows, and the Israeli 
people know these justifications are very weak. 
  They say the news media did not enter into and did not 
participate in the summit. We believe peace cannot be lasting 
if it is not a just peace. If peace is not just and is imposed 
in accordance with transient circumstances and facts, then there 
will be no peace, because circumstances and facts can change. 
For peace to be lasting, it must be just. Just peace guarantees 
all Arab people's rights. These rights are indivisible. We 
have an example of a separate peace in Egypt. This separate 
peace could not prevent wars on the Lebanese front and in the 
West Bank and the Gaza Strip where our heroic Arab people have 
their intifadah. 
  In order to have a comprehensive peace, there must be 
coordination. We believe in the unity of the cause, the unity 
of the struggle, and the unity of the solution. Our fate is 
one. We hope there will be an end to political boundaries. 
But, this is a hope for the future that will be governed by 
future circumstances and developments. Now, at the current 
stage, there is a need for coordination, because Israeli efforts 
are aimed at imposing peace, or at suggesting there is peace 
without actually implementing peace on the ground. Israel tries 
to penetrate the Arab world economically and to propagate the 
idea of a Middle Eastern market, while continuing to occupy the 
West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and southern 
Lebanon. 
  We believe the occupation of southern Lebanon is the 
continuation of fighting there. Territory has never been and 
will never be a means of defense, but the cause of continued 
fighting. We have always said we are proud of your wise and 
honorable stands and your political wisdom, which is recognized 
by enemies before friends. We have faith in Syria's leadership 
role. We hope God will grant you success as a leader of the 
Arab nation and a leader of Syria. 
  God willing, peace based on the establishment of a 
Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, will be 
achieved. God willing, the Syrian flag will fly over the Golan 
and peace will prevail in the region. 
  Poet Mustafa al-Jammal, chairman of the 'Ara and 'Ar'ara 
council in the Triangle recited a poem titled Damascus, in which 
he reviewed the glorious past of Damascus and Syria's role in 
Arab struggle throughout history. He offered condolences to the 
president on the homeland's loss of Staff Major Engineer 
Paratrooper Basil al-Asad. 
  Professor Khalil 'Ataminah from B'ir Zayt University recited 
a poem in praise of Basil al-Asad in which he expressed his 
heartfelt condolences to the president and the Syrian people on 
the homeland's loss of Basil al-Asad. He praised Syria's 
militant stands throughout history. 
  The president replied to the speakers of the delegation 
members, saying: I was pleased with this meeting. I was 
pleased with this fraternal atmosphere. You prove, through what 
we heard from you, that boundaries and borders cannot cancel 
sentiments and history. We will continue to be sons of one 
nation. We will continue to aspire and work for our glory and 
dignity. Your are now in your country. This is not only my 
opinion, but it also expresses the feelings of all citizens in 
Syria. [passage omitted]

  [Text] During his visit to the tomb of his great 
grandfather Prophet Muhammad, God's peace and blessings be upon 
him, in Medina, and during his circumambulation in Mecca, His 
Majesty King Husayn reminded the Islamic nation on the night of 
al-Qadr [the night the koran was revealed] of the importance of 
Islamic and Arab solidarity against the ferocious onslaught 
against Muslims and Arabs. King Husayn's gesture is not new; it 
stems from the continuous role the Hashemites have played in 
unifying the Arabs and Muslims throughout the ages. It also 
indicates that this blessed month is the month of communication, 
amity, and love among the Muslims in all their countries. In 
addition to performing the minor pilgrimage, the king's visit to 
Mecca and Medina sought to intensify Islamic and Arab efforts, 
which stem from the Hashemites' struggle in national, pan-Arab, 
and humanitarian Jordan, to unite in rank, word, and position. 
Jordan rose above the pan-Arab wounds to heal the rift which 
afflicted the Arab homeland after the Gulf war for the sake of 
restoring Arab solidarity and reactivating joint Arab action 
that can confront the serious challenges threatening the Arab 
and Islamic nation.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi addressed a Ramadan 
banquet he hosted at the B'abda Palace this evening. He said 
the Lebanese people are firm in their unity no matter how often 
they are faced with challenges and danger. He added that the 
abominable crime [explosion in a Beirut church] committed in the 
midst of the peace process surprised us but the Lebanese 
people's unanimity on denouncing it came as a plebiscite that 
confirmed the confidence in our march. The president added: 
Hence, it is our responsibility to be frank. Committing a 
criminal act inside God's houses reflects the extent to which 
moral, spiritual, and civil backwardness has reached. We are no 
longer able to tell whether the call for peace ushers in the 
21st century or whether it stoops with humanity to the world of 
treachery. We appeal to the wise people and thinkers to rush to 
launch a major cultural awakening campaign to uproot the desire 
for violence and extremism. We uphold the cause of peace and 
democracy, and man's life is dearer than shedding blood in vain. 
The Lebanese people's denunciation of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre was no less than the denunciation of the massacre in 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. We are united for the sake of 
Lebanon as we are united against violence and extremism. 
Lebanon, which held the shield of defense of all Arabs, is 
against the defamation of Arab dignity anywhere, even against 
our brothers [reference to Palestinians], for whom we bore the 
heaviest burden when they believed that the road to Jerusalem 
passed through the destruction of Lebanon. When they thought 
they had obtained their rights, they broke away from us and 
bypassed Arab solidarity, to which we committed ourselves when 
the negotiations began. 
  President al-Hirawi continued: Our security has been 
achieved, but before we could rebuild and recover our rights, 
certain factions have rushed through crime to revive fear and 
doubt in our unity and accomplishments. However, the national 
unity proved how fruitful our efforts have been and proved that 
our peace process is genuine. He added: You all know that any 
incident smaller than this crime was enough to foment sedition 
and destroy the country. We have won the wager, the bet on our 
unity. The Lebanese people decided on coexistence as their way 
of life and as the message of their country. Any violation of 
this method is a blow against the Lebanese people's will and 
against the whole world, which was unanimous on supporting 
Lebanon's reconciliation, independence, and sovereignty. 
Foreign plots will not succeed if people at home are not 
(?deceived) by wrong convictions and allured by a handful of 
money. In any case, the state will not hesitate to deal with 
any breach of security because security, freedom, and national 
unity take precedence over politics and its ploys. What 
happened did not target the Christians as much as it targeted 
the state, the citizen, and all of Lebanon. 
  The president said that what is needed is a link between 
freedom and fact. He added that decisive options are necessary 
in various economic, political, cultural, and educational 
spheres and noted that loyalty to the country is not determined 
according to relations with officials. 
  He asked: How can we be healthy and how can democracy be 
healthy amidst sectarian squabbling? What is required is a 
thought that will develop citizenship and combat sectarianism 
and tribalism. 
  He emphasized commitment to seeking a comprehensive and just 
peace based on international resolutions and in coordination 
with the brothers, especially Syria. He said: We will not go 
separately and will allow no one to take exclusive control of 
us. We will not be insignificant in peace time. We are 
following up the process with every confidence and faith. 
  President al-Hirawi affirmed that everyone will rush to 
receive his holiness the pope, who will see the truth in our 
country and realize that the greatest of nations is the one that 
grows stronger when there is danger.

<H3>  Based on the Bill Proposed by the Cabinet, 70 Percent of 
Next Year's Budget Will Concern the Government and 
Government-Affiliated Companies </H3>
  Economic Division. According to the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget bill, the expenditures of government 
companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with 
the government will be 56,294 billion rials[R], which makes up 
more than 70 percent of the expenditures. 
  The economic correspondent of RESALAT reports that the 
budget 
of government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments 
affiliated with the government will increase by 59.7 percent 
next year. The amount of the budget of government companies next 
year is projected at R50,034 billion; for-profit establishments 
affiliated with the government, R1,043 billion; and banks, 
R5,216 billion. 
  According to this report, while in next year's budget the 
income of government companies and banks has been estimated at 
R47,937 billion, these units will have R52,300 billion in 
expenditures. In other words, government companies and banks 
will spend a total of R4,363 billion beyond their revenues. 
  Government companies and banks will receive R7,313 billion 
in 
loans from domestic sources in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995], and only R2,412 billion will be repaid that year. 
  The national budget next year has been estimated to be 
R79,686 billion, of which R36,011 billion is from revenues 
gained, including those from oil, taxes, and special and other 
revenues. 
  Of the revenues of the national budget, 27.7 percent is 
income from oil; 8.13 percent from taxes; 70 percent from 
government companies, banks, and for-profit establishments 
affiliated with the government [percentages as published]. It is 
noteworthy that those items that have been included twice have 
not been deducted from the above-mentioned revenues. 
  Next year, the government has projected R2,224 billion in 
special revenues in its general budget. Due to the procedures 
for the collection and payment in this budget, a need for more 
control and supervision is felt with regard to them. 
  The general budget, which was set at R25,425 billion in 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994], will reach R36,011 billion in 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], with 41.6 percent, which is 
about a threefold increase over the final figure in 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993]. 
  Economic experts believe that, considering the failure to 
realize the projected oil revenues this year (1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994]), the fact that there is no clear picture of 
price increases due to the continuing crisis in the world oil 
market, the deviation of members from production quotas, and the 
likelihood of Iraq's entry into the market, the oil revenues 
that have been projected on the basis of $14 per barrel must be 
evaluated and examined. 
  The oil revenues, which in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 
1993] 
were in practice R5,133 billion, based on the budget law this 
year are set at R15,597 billion. This figure will increase to 
22,096 billion for next year. 
  Economic experts believe that since the tax figures ratified 
for 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] have not yet been 
obtained, an increase in tax figures, at least within the 
existing mechanisms, will face problems with regard to 
collection next year. Taxes collected in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 
March 1993] amounted to R3,773 billion. This amount was 
projected at R5,409 billion , which did not materialize in 
practice. In 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], taxes have been 
projected at about R6,400 billion. 
  Next year, from the source of the general revenues, R12,613 
billion have been allocated to implementing developmental 
expenditures and R21,153 billion to developmental expenditures 
[as published], which compared to the funds ratified for this 
year (1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]) mark an increase of 
30.2 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively. [as published] 
  The complete elimination of the single foreign currency rate 
as a result of setting the foreign currency for basic goods, oil 
products, medicine, and defense items at a floating rate and 
making up the difference through rial subsidies as well as 
changing the rate of tariffs on electricity, oil products, and 
telephone are other features of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget, which were reported earlier by RESALAT. 
  It is noteworthy that the government has projected R3,005 
billion in subsidies for essential goods, R600 billion in 
subsidies for chemical fertilizers, R30 billion to make up the 
difference in the rate of foreign currency to publish textbooks, 
and R210 billion for recreational hajj pilgrimages.

<H3>  Opinions of Supporting and Opposing Deputies Concerning the 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill </H3>
  Economic Division. The discussions and examination of 
the first round of discussions on the 79,686-billion-rial[R] 
budget bill began this morning in the Majles. 
  According to a report by the economic correspondent of 
RESALAT, based on the ratification of the Majles, the 
examination of the 1973 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
bill will go through two rounds of discussion. In the first 
round of discussions, which began today, after the discussion on 
the general points of the budget and their ratification, a 
decision will be made concerning oil revenues, taxes, and 
special and other revenues. 
  According to this report, 10 hours, including three and a 
half hours for opponents, three and a half hours for supporters, 
one hour for the spokesman of the committee, and two hours for 
the government representative, have been set aside for 
discussions about the general points of the budget, and every 
speaker can speak for 15 minutes and make use of all or part of 
another person's time. 
  The national budget, according to the government proposal 
for 
next year, has been projected at R79,686 billion, of which 
R36,011 billion is comprised of general revenues, including oil, 
taxes, and special and other revenues. 
  Oil revenues in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] were 
R5,133 billion in actuality. According to the law, the budget in 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] was set at R15,597 billion. 
This figure has increased to R23,096 billion in 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995]. In the proposed bill, the government had 
set the share of the oil revenues in the total revenues at 65.8 
percent. After examinations in the related committees of the 
Majles, this figure was reduced to 58.4 percent. 
  In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], R3,773 billion were 
collected in taxes. This amount this year was projected at 
R5,409 billion, which did not materialize. In 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995], about R6,400 billion in taxes have been 
projected by the government. 
  The special Majles committee, after several hours of 
discussion, increased the tax revenues to R7,880. 
  In the open session of the Majles this morning, Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the Majles, offered his 
congratulations on the blessed birthday of the Guardian of the 
Age and said: It is hoped that God will grant us all the 
privilege of awaiting his holiness and obeying his true deputy, 
the grand leader, so that under the wise leadership of Ayatollah 
Khamene'i, we will prepare the grounds for the coming of the 
Imam of the Age. 
  Then Mr. Mirvalad, the spokesman of the Joint Planning and 
Budget and Economic Affairs and Finance Committee, continued a 
report on the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. 
  He said: The annual budget in fact is a representation of 
the 
revenues and expenditures of the country and regulation of the 
expenditures on the basis of revenues. It is not proper to 
expect the annual budget to anticipate and solve all the 
problems of the country. Another issue regarding the budget is 
attention to our maneuverability in the budget offered by the 
government, in other words, to what extent we can create 
changes. In regards to the revenue subheadings of the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, Mr. Mirvalad said: In next 
year's budget, we set up three revenue headings, that is, oil, 
taxes, and miscellaneous revenues, and as the honorable 
president said in his Friday prayer sermons, we cannot survive 
dependence on oil. We took into consideration this important 
point in the budget and tried to reduce the dependence of the 
budget on oil revenues and move towards nonoil revenues. 
  He added: More than 65 percent of the budget presented by 
the 
government to the Majles was dependent on oil, which we reduced 
to 58.4 percent, taking into consideration that we must act 
within the OPEC ceiling. For next year, we anticipated the 
likelihood of Iraq's entry into the world market. 
  The spokesman of the Joint Planning and Budget and Economic 
Affairs and Finance Committee of the Majles emphasized 
preventing the decrease in the price of oil and said: In an 
effort to reduce the decrease in the price of oil, we reduced a 
percentage of our exports and projected $10.5 billion in oil 
revenues for next year. 
  He said: Last year, we were allowed to export 190,000 
barrels 
of oil per day to import oil products. In the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] bill, the government set it at about 340,000 
barrels, which was not accepted by the Joint Committee. 
  He pointed out: Countries that do not have oil revenues 
essentially gain their revenues through taxes. But in recent 
years, due to the lack of strong and coherent tax systems, we 
have been unable to collect taxes fully. Hence, in the 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, we increased the tax revenues. 
  He said: The government had set the share of taxes in the 
total national budget at 19.6 percent, which we increased to 
26.1 percent. We also increased the other revenues from 15.1 
percent to 15.5 percent. 
  Mirvalad pointed out: In Note 25, the government discusses 
three issues. The first one is the increase in the price of 
energy, including kerosene, gasoline, electricity, and diesel 
fuel, so that from the funds gained by this increase, it can 
implement some of the projects. 
  He said: Of the total national revenues, which were set at 
R79,700 billion, R3,317 thousand billion [as published] were 
general revenues, which the committee reduced to R30,000 billion. 
  The spokesman of the Planning and Budget Committee referred 
to the economic effects of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget on the society as reducing economic pressures 
through controlling the volume of cash flow and controlling the 
loans granted by banks. For next year, we approved about a 
15-percent cash flow growth, of which the inflationary effects 
will naturally be about the same. 
  He pointed out: For the first time, we limited the ceiling 
of 
the funds that the private and government sectors are to receive. 
  He added: In Note 25, in regards to electricity, we set 
taxes 
on use in excess of 500 kwhr [kilowatt-hour]. Mirvalad pointed 
out: The issue of the price of energy was one of our most heated 
discussions in the budget. The cost to the government for 
gasoline or kerosene is about 27 tomans per liter and reaches 
the people nearly free of charge. Mirvalad pointed out: One of 
our efforts in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
will be to increase subsidies for essential goods, which the 
government had projected at $690 billion and the committee 
increased to $800 million. [sentence as published] Also, the 
government had set $300 million in subsidies for drugs, which we 
increased to $400 million. 
  He said: With consideration for the statements of the grand 
leader concerning decreasing foreign obligations, we projected 
that next year our debts would be reduced to $1.6 billion. 
  He also cited the increase in commercial taxes on imports to 
support domestic producers and making revenues realistic among 
the other characteristics of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget. 
  This report indicates that Mr. Astaneh was the first 
opponent 
of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, who declared 
the "planning and budget writing problems" and the "growth of 
cash flow" as the most important reasons for his opposition. 
  He termed the 15-month delay of the government in presenting 
the Second Plan bill a violation of Note 36 of the First Plan 
law and said: The decision to postpone the implementation of the 
Second Plan requires a law. 
  Concerning the problem of planning, he said: This problem 
concerns lack of change in the traditional planning and budget 
writing method and failure to look into the future by the Plan 
and Budget Organization. It is not clear what picture the Plan 
and Budget Organization has of the next three decades, despite 
all its organization and experts. What will the situation of the 
country be if the oil is finished and is exports cannot be 
justified? What amount of the $100 billion foreign currency 
revenues of the plan has been spent on fundamental investments? 
Can the sale of oil and factories (national capital) be 
considered revenue? I am interested in the director of the Plan 
and Budget Organization offering a picture of Iran without oil. 
  In regards to foreign currency obligations, Astaneh said: 
According to Part 6 of Paragraph A of Note 29, the level of 
foreign currency obligations at the end of 1372 [20 March 1994] 
should be 15 percent less than at the beginning of this year, 
whereas in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], $10 billion in 
late debts were created in the worst form (that is, several 
thousand items of minor debts to several countries, which 
indicates failure to think on the part of the economic experts 
of the country), and in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] we 
will have another $6 billion in debt. According to Note 29, any 
violation of the decrease of 15 percent of the obligations is 
regarded as use of government property. My colleagues have noted 
how the Central Bank has acted. 
  He emphasized: Repayment of the foreign debts as soon as 
possible, no matter how little, must be given priority. I thank 
the Joint Committee for reducing the $4.5 billion in new 
government obligations in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]. 
  Concerning the growth of cash flow, Astaneh said: While next 
year the price of oil exports will decrease, the government has 
increased the total national budget to R79,686 billion and the 
Joint Committee to R71,240 billion. In the First Plan, it was 
determined that the cash flow should increase to R22,000 billion 
by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], whereas by the end of this 
year the growth of cash flow will be increased up to R45,000 
billion. 
  He did not consider the change in the banking funds at the 
level of R5,547 billion in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] in 
the interests of the country and pointed out: This issue will 
cause the cash flow and inflation to grow by 30 percent. 
  In regards to Note 25, he emphasized: Until a mechanism is 
devised for the increase in the income of the salary earners and 
those with fixed incomes, the pressure of Note 25 will weigh 
heavily on the shoulders of the people, and the poor will become 
poorer and the capitalists will gain more capital. 
  Mr. Zadsar, the deputy from Jiroft, spoke as the first 
supporter and said: One of the best corrections of the honorable 
committee in the budget bill is the control of the growth of 
cash flow, to which attention has been paid for the first time 
in the budget bill, because the above-mentioned committee has 
specified the growth of the cash flow in Note 2 and allowed it 
at a maximum of 15 percent, whereas the government has projected 
it up to 23 percent. It has allocated nearly 55 percent of the 
growth of the cash flow to the private sector to enable banks 
and banking funds to take effective steps in starting domestic 
production. 
  In regards to the control of subsidies, and in some cases 
their elimination, he said: In Note 25, the government has 
projected about R2,970 billion in revenues secured by raising 
the price of various fuels and obliged itself to spend it on 
starting important, vital, and fundamental projects. The Joint 
Committee has looked at this realistically and reduced it to 
R1,900 billion. 
  He then continued: Upon the suggestion of the government, 
gasoline was R120; diesel fuel, R20; heating oil, R10; kerosene, 
R20; and natural gas, R12.4 per cubic meter. With the agreement 
of the committee, gasoline was R80; diesel fuel, R15; kerosene, 
R20; heating oil, R10; and natural gas, R12.4 per cubic meter. 
  Then, stating that we know that the actual price of the 
above-mentioned items is several times the sale price, he said: 
We know that every liter of gasoline costs about R270 for the 
government. Indeed, do the R220 in subsidies paid from the 
Treasury of the country on every liter of gasoline go to the 
poor or the rich? 
  He said: I believe that the well-to-do [people] use cheap 
electricity, and this is not just. 
  He then said: It is noteworthy that electricity for 
agricultural use has not become more expensive at all, and the 
cost of electricity used by the people has only increased when 
it is in excess of 500 kwhr, which in fact has not changed. 
  Mohammad Baqer Bahrami, the deputy of Asadabad, spoke in 
opposition to the budget bill and said: In my opinion, and 
according to the studies that have been carried out, the 
projections must be logical and more realistic. My question to 
the Joint Committee and the honorable government is, on the 
basis of what formula have they projected the price of oil to be 
closer to reality? In our opinion, the projections of the 
government and the committee are not based on logic. 
  He then said: There is a great deal of waste in government 
companies. We receive many reports and much criticism. There is 
a vast difference between the salaries paid in the companies and 
government organizations. Why has the Joint Committee not 
stopped this waste in the budget bill? Is it not true that when 
they are exempt from taxes, they must make investments? Has this 
been done? Have we controlled foreign purchases? 
  He added: In connection with Note 25, there is no one in the 
country and the Majles who opposes prices becoming more 
realistic. But at what price? The share of energy per family in 
our country is 10,070 tomans in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 
1994]. The indirect effect of this is 16,000 tomans. 
  If we want to collect the actual prices from the consumer, 
do 
we have a mechanism in place to receive more money from those 
people who use more energy, services, and government goods and 
to separate them from the vulnerable strata of the society? I 
believe this mechanism does not exist. We only have a special 
mechanism for collecting taxes from employees, which is deducted 
from salaries, whether they want it or not. But we do not have a 
special method for collecting taxes from strata with large 
incomes. 
  The next supporter was Mr. Nowbakht, who described the 
special climate governing the budget as follows: 1) Inclusion of 
the policies of the Second Plan in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget; 2) the budget inherits the policies and 
economic development planning of the First Plan; 3) the speed of 
economic reconstruction in the First Plan; and 4) the decrease 
in the price of oil. 
  He said: It is impossible to turn away from the economic 
modification policies. 
  He said: Considering that the Joint Committee decreased the 
ceiling of exports and the price per barrel of oil, the level of 
revenues was set at 4,000 billion, or less than what the 
government proposed, which seems more realistic. 
  The details of the opinions of supporters and opponents will 
be published in tomorrow's issue.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs 
Division. The Majles held sessions yesterday and last night 
and began its examination in the first round of discussions of 
the general points of the budget, during which time supporters 
and opponents of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
made speeches. We call to your attention the details of the 
discussions. 
<H5>  'Ali Zadsar, Supporter </H5>
  A major part of the statements of Mr. Zadsar were published 
in yesterday's issue of the newspaper. Here, the parts of his 
speech concerning waste, which were mentioned as examples will 
be noted: The officials of Kerman Province, in particular the 
governor-general, should be kind enough to enlighten us as to 
whether or not the Mola al-Movahedin Institute and its numerous 
affiliated companies has been formed and is thriving, with all 
the political, economic, and cultural resources of the sacred 
Islamic regime, and whether or not the income taxes have been 
deposited in the Treasury. 
  He continued: Has the Mahan Company, which competed with the 
national airlines, been established with the support of the 
government and the office of the governor-general of Kerman and 
the money and power of the country or not? Is the tax on the 
profit gained from every round-trip ticket, which is sold at 
60,000 rials[R] deposited in the Treasury or in the account of 
the members of the board of directors? Many such questions are 
being asked throughout the country and in Greater Tehran, all of 
which cannot be mentioned in this brief speech. 
<H5>  'Abdollah Nowruzi, Opponent </H5>
  Mr. 'Abdollah Nowruzi, the deputy of the people of Malayer, 
spoke as an opponent of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget and said: Our process of writing the budget is routine; 
our budget writers do not evaluate the budget of the previous 
years; and the revenues in the budget are not written in 
rationally. 
  He said: Everyone knows that the decrease in the price of 
oil 
is in effect to impose pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Now, what practical and reasonable methods have our planners 
devised to reduce dependence on oil, move towards nonoil 
exports, increase tax revenues, and decrease the expenditures of 
the government organizations? He added: Companies evade the 
payment of taxes and even fabricate numbers in order not to pay 
taxes, while a part of the revenues of these companies is placed 
at the disposal of real or legal persons or spent on luxuries. 
He added: Such companies are included in the main factors in 
inflation growth in the society. 
  Emphasizing that revenues from increased government services 
be spent on fundamental affairs, he asked for the control of 
prices. 
<H5>  Mohammad Reza Khabbaz, Supporting </H5>
  Khabbaz was the next supporter. He said: The revolving funds 
last year were R2,500 billion, which the committee reduced to 
R1,000 billion. Yet, this increase in cash flow is not without 
effects. Another point that the Joint Committee included in this 
bill is the examination of government companies, banks, and 
government-affiliated for-profit establishments that are 
required to have their annual figures and budgets ratified by 
the Majles. 
  Referring to the capping of the ceiling of government funds 
set at R7,000 billion, he added: If this ceiling is not capped, 
you know that injecting money into the society will mean 
increasing the cash flow, and increasing the cash flow means the 
creation of inflation. Since we are moving towards 
privatization, our slogans and actions must be the same. Hence, 
the majority of these funds, about 55 percent, are allocated to 
the private sector for privatization. 
  He mentioned the elimination of tax exemptions as another 
characteristic of this report and pointed out: In a correct 
economy, tax exemption is meaningless. Of course, there are some 
companies and charitable organizations, which the government 
must take under its wing, and the Majles certainly does not 
oppose this. He added: Another characteristic of the report is 
that the Consumer and Producer Protection Organization has been 
given the responsibility of granting subsidies for essential 
goods. However, my support should not suggest overall agreement; 
there are problems in this report concerning that the Majles 
will use its authority at the proper time. Note 27 is another 
feature, according to which, fortunately, a good fund of more 
than R300 billion has been allocated to the Office of the 
Affairs of Deprived Regions. This is a very constructive action. 
In regards to Note 25, offered by the government, we believe 
that this note is in keeping with the Second [Five-Year 
Development] Plan. In other words, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget is not the place for it to be examined. 
  In continuing his speech, Khabbaz pointed out: Another 
reason 
for my support for the proposal of the Joint Committee is that, 
fortunately, attention is paid to the details of many of the 
issues, and the government is given the responsibility of taking 
into consideration the inflation index in coordinating the 
appropriate profit margin for economic activities in the 
industries and trade sectors with regard to 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] pricing of guaranteed agricultural and 
animal husbandry products. 
<H5>  Mohsen Yahyavi, Opponent </H5>
  Yahyavi, the deputy of Tehran, as an opponent of the 1373 
[21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, thanked the brothers in the 
Joint Committee for their hard work and said: Decreasing 
inflationary pressures by emphasizing the control of the volume 
of cash flow and increasing subsidies on essential goods, such 
as the increase in the government's ceiling from $300 million to 
$800 million, the increase in the government's ceiling from $300 
million to $400 million for the import of raw materials, and the 
allocation of $80 million in foreign currency for students, 
which reduced the pressures on their families and for which the 
government had not included anything, are something but, in my 
opinion, not enough. 
  Referring to Note 25, he said: In Note 25, by increasing 
prices, the Joint Committee claims that 5,000 tomans will be the 
individual per capita share. In reality, it will be several 
times this amount. 
  In hiring a taxi, fuel must not be more than 20 percent of 
the effective factor, because attrition and spare parts are at 
issue. [sentence as published] But, as soon as we increase the 
price 1.5 times, even if the taxi driver does not double his 
fare, he will increase it by no less than 1.5 times. Based on 
greed, they impose pressure on our people several fold. What 
percentage of the people of our country have we exempted from 
taxes because they have a monthly income of 15,000 tomans or 
less? And then we impose other taxes on them. Of course, we know 
that these prices are not realistic prices and the subsidy that 
we pay for our services is the most unjust distribution of the 
Treasury among the people. Why? Because more of this subsidy 
goes to affluent families, who make more use of these services. 
He stated that the elimination of this injustice will take time. 
  In another part of his speech, Mr. Yahyavi said: 
  I remember that my brother, Mr. Dari, spoke prior to the 
open 
session on certain issues that occurred in the presence of the 
grand leader. When I said to him what I have said here, perhaps 
a little more, concerning Note 25, corroborating my statements, 
he mentioned the problems of certain individuals who have 
complained to him. For example, a person whom he trusts to be 
truthful had said to him that he has not been able to buy meat 
at 500 tomans [per kg] for six months. Then, someone added that 
some people may take advantage of what he says and, resorting to 
Note 25, oppose it. He said, If so, they will have done a good 
thing. 
  This shows that the leader is very well aware of the 
pressures imposed on the people. He then added that some things 
seem logical, but the time for them is not right yet. For 
example, I believe that we must produce as little oil as 
possible. But when the minister of petroleum speaks to me, 
stating that we have produced more oil, I admire it, because 
today we require that more oil be produced. As a result, the 
interpretations of this note might be on the side of social 
justice, but on the basis of this statement, now is not the 
right time for this social justice. Of course, this last brief 
statement is my own conclusion. 
  He said: The Joint Committee has increased the subsidy on 
essential goods by $200 million. But we know that this subsidy, 
with the population increase that we have, is still about 300 
percent less than that of last year. We have decreased the 
foreign currency allocated to essential goods compared to last 
year, and by increasing prices we impose another problem on the 
people. Of course, there may be some exceptions to these price 
increases, such as for electricity, which can be calculated on 
the basis of increasing consumption. But I believe this note 
must be omitted. 
  Yahyavi added: Part "B" of Paragraph "D," regarding document 
credit opened prior to 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], 
states that it should be close to the floating foreign currency 
rate. This is very dangerous. You see, if the Ministry of 
Petroleum, which has ordered a great deal of material, waits to 
import [those materials] tomorrow, it will have to contribute 
all you have allocated to it to make the payment. 
  Referring to the effects of Note 2 on the increase in the 
price of general needs and increasing inflation, he said: If a 
proper mechanism is not devised, the increase in the price of 
energy will have ill effects on the deprived classes. 
  He regarded the national tax system as insufficient to 
achieve the projected goals in this bill and added: Considering 
that there is more emphasis on taxes than oil revenues, this 
system must be reformed. 
<H5>  'Abbasi'ali Zali, Supporter </H5>
  The next supporter of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
national budget bill was Dr. Zali, the deputy from Karaj, who 
said in defense of the budget bill: Those who spoke as opponents 
stated the opinion of each and every member of the Joint 
Planning and Budget and Economic Affairs and Finance Committee 
and other experts. 
  The reason for my support for this bill is simple. The 
honorable deputies must, on the one hand, take into 
consideration the problems that were at issue and, on the other 
hand, accept that in the 47 meetings held to examine the issues, 
in the presence of a large number of responsible and expert 
individuals and deputies, ultimately, this outcome may have been 
the best ratification possible. 
  Concerning the decrease in expenditures and preventing 
waste, 
Dr. Zali said: The Joint Committee took these problems into 
consideration. Decreasing dependence on oil and decreasing 
foreign obligations were very important principles to which 
attention was paid throughout. Finally, by implementing revenue 
policies, we tried to take into consideration issues concerning 
the deprived regions and low-income strata as well as the 
agricultural sector, to which special attention must be paid in 
the Second Plan. 
  He also added: The fact that our revenues must conform to 
the 
expenditures is absolutely true. We projected the foreign 
currency revenues of the country at about $1.9 billion less than 
that of the government bill. We feel that if we take into 
consideration the realities, it will be in the best interest of 
the country. 
  In connection with the increase in taxes in 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995], he said: We increased the tax revenues from 
19.1 percent to 26.1 percent. In other words, we made the 
revenues rely on 7 percent more taxes than what the government 
had proposed. As to what mechanism exists to collect the taxes, 
that is an issue that must be looked into in regard to 
implementation. God willing, the tax pressure will be on the 
shoulders of those who should pay them. 
  The member of the Planning and Budget Committee stated: 
Taking into consideration that imports must be prevented, 
through import tariffs we were able to increase government 
revenues from R1,540 billion to R2,520 billion. In regards to 
the increase in prices in Note 25, he said: These decisions are 
not without reason. At the present, we have projects in the 
country that must be implemented, and their implementation is 
dependent on this note. If the deputies are prepared to stop the 
implementation of these projects and abandon them, eliminating 
the increase in prices would be logical. But if they are not 
content with this idea, another approach is to increase 
borrowing as before, and we have witnessed the inherent results 
and problems. Hence, if we have to make gasoline R80 as opposed 
to 12 tomans, as was suggested by the government, the decision 
was based on these facts. In order to avoid putting pressure on 
the low-income strata, we implemented these issues. Pressure 
must be on the shoulders of those who make the most use of the 
national resources. If we give subsidies to energy, fuel, and 
other things, who is making use of these subsidies? We say that 
policies should be implemented so as to avoid harming the 
low-income classes. Every day, 300 million liters of gasoline 
are used in the country. If you calculate it, it comes to 700 
million tomans. Why should all the strata pay this subsidy? 
  Concerning waste and its prevention in government 
organizations, Dr. Zali said: Most of the waste is in the 
government companies. We insist that the government gradually 
transfer these companies, so that they will become profitable 
and pay their taxes. We must accept that the decisions that have 
been made are absolutely in the interest of the country. Just 
imagine, 15 government companies, which were supposed to pay 
taxes have refused to do so and have paid less, and 25 companies 
paid no taxes. Concerning the first case, the Joint Committee 
included R28 billion for them. In the second case, the 
difference was R504 billion. On the whole, we made the policy 
for the companies such that they are not allowed to save more 
than 30 percent of the difference between their gross profit and 
their expenditures. Rather, they should be taxed. The 
implementation of this policy will prevent waste.

<H5>  Zare'i-Qanavati, Opponent </H5>
  Zare'i-Qanavati, the deputy of the people of Behbahan, was 
the next opponent of the budget bill. He explained the reason 
for his opposition in his speech and said: I consider the 
changes in the budget bill by the Joint Committee a useful step, 
but the general direction of the budget can be improved. What I 
oppose is failure to achieve social justice, which is an 
essential principle of the Islamic government that is emphasized 
by the grand leader. 
  He then said: What the society expects of the Majles and 
what 
is emphasized by the grand leader is that price increases be 
prevented. This is also what the Majles wishes, but it is not 
seen in the budget bill. Although the Joint Committee has tried 
to control the price increases to some extent, the emphasis of 
the grand leader on conservation should be evident in the annual 
budget. The experience of previous years has shown that 
conservation is not achieved through advice and instructions, 
and the annual budget and the Five-Year Plan do not indicate it 
in the form of a policy. 
  In continuation, he pointed out: Under the present 
conditions, the strata with fixed incomes have a hard life. The 
deputies these days are aware of the anxiety of this 
hard-working strata as a result of the increases for next year 
in terms of such items as oil, water, electricity, and 
telephone. The cost of food, clothing, housing rent, 
transportation fares, and services in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994] have increased by more than 50 percent, while the 
income of families has remained the same. As a result, their 
purchasing power has decreased. In the formulas of the 
organizations and the budget for contractors, inflation is 
calculated quarterly and modifications are made, and no one 
questions why this modification is implemented in regards to the 
workers of those workshops. 
  Praising the hard work of the committee in amending the 
bill, 
Zare'i-Qanavati said: Do not be satisfied with these reforms. No 
matter how much you raise taxes, since you do not have a system 
of controls, all these are paid by the low-income strata. 
  The figures in the budget show that dependence on oil has 
increased. In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 Mar 1993], this dependence 
was about 42 percent; in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], 
about 61 percent; and in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995]; 
about 62 percent. On the other hand, reliance on tax revenues 
has decreased. 
  In opposing the budget bill, the deputy from Behbahan also 
projected that in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] the value 
of the rial vis-a-vis the dollar will decrease. 
  In conclusion, he added: Efforts to free the country from 
reliance on oil and the dollar have had no favorable results. 
Also, an examination of the figures in the budget show that the 
debt of the government to the banking system will increase, and 
this increase is about R4,365 billion. 
  They say there is nothing to worry about in regards to the 
late debt payments. But we should worry, because, considering 
the uncertain future of the oil and the decreased 
foreign-currency income, repayment of part of the debt will 
cause problems, and failure to pay will also result in the 
postponement of many of the economic projects. 
<H5>  Seyyed Hoseyn Sharifi, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent was Sharifi, who in expressing his 
opposition mentioned the first problem as reliance on the 
traditional method of budget writing and said: For example, in 
the current sector, the increase of a percentage point over the 
budgets of previous years is made without an examination of the 
prices and the actual needs of every province. In this 
connection, there must be a basic revision. 
  He added: Despite the fact that large amounts have been 
invested in government companies, the profit resulting from them 
should overshadow other government revenues. But, unfortunately, 
in Paragraph "B" of Note 2 there is still talk of payments to 
assist the government companies because of the losses from the 
general funds. On the other hand, every year a major part of the 
banking funds is taken by these companies, which prevents the 
banks from giving loans to the private sector and other classes. 
  He continued: I ask the government representative to firstly 
explain about the curve showing increases and decreases in the 
debts of companies to the banking system and their present 
amount of debt and also discuss the companies in the country, 
which show profits and those that generate losses. In order to 
deal more realistically with an examination of the budget bill, 
the government representative must present a brief report on the 
collection of general revenues in the nine months of this year 
in proportion to the projected figures of the Majles. This can 
be one of the effective bases on which to make decisions 
concerning the present bill. 
  Stating that the cash flow increase this year and offering a 
correct analysis of the level of increase and lack of growth for 
next year, in considering the proposed budget, will make 
decision making easier for the Majles, he said: When there is 
talk of the vulnerable strata, we are talking about people who 
are covered by the Imam's Emergency Committee, whereas there are 
many salary earners, retired persons, villagers, and small 
businessmen on fixed incomes, and they must be taken into 
consideration in any discussion on the modification of prices. 
The speaker continued: It would be good if in the government 
bill special restrictions were placed on organizations in terms 
of foreign purchases and if attention were paid to industries 
and support for domestic products. If the Majles were absolutely 
certain that the revenues from Note 25 would all be spent on 
creating domestic jobs and on support for domestic products, 
certainly it would react to it differently. But such is not the 
existing trend of use of the domestic products in Note 25 by 
officials. For example, in Arak there are parent and heavy 
industries that are capable of producing more than the needs of 
the country, yet we see, in regards to oil and electricity, that 
the foreign manufacturers still thrive in the economic arena of 
the country, while, on the other hand, factories cry out in 
complaint. 
  Sharifi also pointed out: While it is true that there are 
telephone [services], decreased costs, and shortened time 
regarding commercial and residential buildings, they create 
expenditures for families and create income for the merchants. 
[sentence as published] 
  If Note 25 is accepted by the Majles, it can be modified in 
its place and its imposition in the accounting system of 
telephone bills is not a difficult task. 
<H5>  Mohammad Reza Bahonar, Supporter </H5>
  The next supporter was Bahonar, the deputy from Tehran, who 
said: The most essential cause of inflation is increased cash 
flow. In next year's budget, we ratified R7,000 billion as the 
ceiling on the growth of cash flow. Considering the cash flow 
that we anticipate having by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], 
God willing, next year, while there will be some thriving of the 
national economy, the increase in cash flow will not exceed 15 
percent. Of course, in the government program proposed to the 
Majles, that is, the Second Developmental Plan, the average 
growth was [projected at] 12.5 percent, but, for various 
reasons, the bill presented to the Majles projected more than 
the amount I have stated. We hope that through controls and by 
better allocating banking funds and being somewhat conservative 
in granting loans to the large government and public companies, 
next year we can have a reasonable and tolerable cash flow for 
the oppressed strata of the society. 
  In continuation, in connection with Note 29 he said: The 
Joint Committee has omitted one or two main paragraphs of the 
above-mentioned note, because the economic capability of our 
country in connection with foreign obligations is much greater 
than what exists now. If we were viewed as are other countries 
in the world, even if we were to have more foreign debt than we 
have, this would not be detrimental. 
  Bahonar continued: Considering this principle, we must study 
our foreign obligations carefully and realize that our foreign 
obligations are below what is normal for other countries in the 
world. 
  In connection with observing the inevitable principle of 
dignity, wisdom, and expediency in foreign policy, the deputy 
from Tehran then said: These policies have been announced by the 
grand leader, and in economic issues we must keep in mind the 
three points of the dignity, wisdom, and expediency of the 
Islamic Republic. This year, compared to 1367 [21 March 1988-20 
March 1989], we have produced perhaps more than $6 billion in 
new products. In 1367 [21 March 1988-20 March 1989], we were 
obliged to import these same products from other countries. 
  Continuing, he said: If these paragraphs have been omitted 
from Note 29, it does not mean that the projects are shut down. 
It means that these projects can work within our acceptable 
ceiling of funds next year. But if they are about to go above 
that ceiling, we suggest that they be carefully examined 
expertly in the Second Plan. 
  In connection with Note 25, Engineer Bahonar said: In 
connection with the increase in the price of fuel, the Joint 
Committee agreed to R80 for gasoline, which is a 60-percent 
increase. However, the government had proposed R120. The 
committee agreed to R20 for kerosene, which is a 40-percent 
increase, whereas the government had proposed a 100-percent 
increase. We ratified the same figures as the government for 
natural gas, that is, at a 126-percent increase, and heating oil 
at a 25-percent price increase, the same as the government. 
  Then, in connection with the issue of customs tariffs, he 
said: We projected a mild increase in these tariffs for next 
year to support domestic products somewhat. We have been able to 
write the committee report so as to compel government companies 
to pay the taxes they are supposed to pay to the Treasury. 
<H5>  Yunos Mohammadi, Opponent </H5>
  Yunos Mohammadi, the deputy from Khorramshahr, was another 
opponent of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] national 
budget bill. He referred to Note 25 of this bill and said: The 
projected increase in the rate of fuel in this note will reduce 
the purchasing power of the people and weaken the national 
currency. 
  He also asked for the support of the low-income strata with 
regard to economic modifications and increased prices. 
  In order to reduce unnecessary revenues and create a balance 
between revenues and expenditures, the deputy of the people of 
Khorramshahr emphasized the elimination of luxury and waste, 
control of the smuggling of fuel, and prevention of the 
ratification of new developmental projects. [sentence as 
published] 
<H5>  'Ali Movahhedi-Savoji, Supporting </H5>
  'Ali Movahhedi-Savoji the deputy from Tehran was the next 
supporter of the budget bill. He said: No one in the Majles 
opposes the general points of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget. But the disagreements concern the details and 
paragraphs of the bill. All the honorable opponents consider the 
direction of the Joint Planning and Budget and Economic Affairs 
and Finance Committee desirable, and it has gone in the 
direction that they wanted. They should look at the revenues 
realistically as far as possible and ratify them. In connection 
with reducing the government expenditures, as far as they could, 
they reduced them. The decrease of R2,000 billion from the 
general budget is in this direction. Also, in regards to 
revolving funds in the Treasury, which are cited in Note 1, we 
can see that the committee has reduced the government proposed 
revolving fund. In my opinion, this was the right thing to do, 
because this revolving fund at the beginning of the year is in 
effect borrowing, which of course must be repaid by the end of 
the year. In the past, the method was that they took this 
revolving fund and later did not return it to the Treasury. The 
important point is that the Majles and the Planning and Budget 
Committee must supervise and control this revolving fund. 
  In regards to Note 25, Movahhedi-Savoji said: The Joint 
Committee has tried to reduce the price increases. I do not 
agree with the government proposed increase in the price of 
electricity, water, telephones, and post, because in the past 
few years the government and related organizations have 
increased the price of telephones, water, electricity, and post. 
At present, people are protesting, worrying, and complaining 
about the increase in these prices, and to increase them again 
would not seem right. But, in connection with petroleum products 
that increase, I must say that the consumption of fuel in our 
country is higher than that of all other countries, and 
according to available reports, Iran uses enough fuel for 1.2 
billion people. It would appear that this action is the result 
of the fact that the government brings an excessive amount of 
gasoline and other products into the market. Of this 60 million 
population, how many make use of cars? Why is it necessary for 
gasoline that costs 30 tomans to be given to them for 5 tomans? 
One of the harmful effects of artificially low prices is that a 
great deal of fuel in our country is smuggled to other 
countries. Hence, the increase in the price of gasoline by the 
Joint Committee will have no inflationary effects. 
  Concerning the completion of incomplete projects in the 
country, he said: We believe new developmental plans and 
projects should not be started while we have important 
incomplete projects in the country. We must first complete those 
with this tight budget and the problems that we have and then 
start new projects. 
<H5>  Beytollah Ja'fari, Opponent </H5>
  He said: Note 25, in the form ratified in the Joint 
Committee, is still too inflationary and if ratified will result 
in increased prices in the country and confront the hard-working 
strata, who are the main soldiers of the revolution and Islam 
with difficulty. If the price of gasoline increases by 50 
percent, will the income of the people also increase by the same 
amount? They might say that subsidies are mostly used by the 
wealthy. The answer is clear. If the tax system is correctly 
amended and implemented, this problem will be resolved. If the 
government and the Plan and Budget Organization are looking for 
revenues, why do they use this lever in regards to the 
low-income class that makes up the majority? 
  Why does the government not make the government companies 
active? Of 1,200 government companies that, based on Note 2 of 
the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law, must include 
their budgets in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, 
only 460 companies have included their budgets in the bill. The 
use of the budget by government companies is subject to bylaws 
that are usually ratified by the general assemblies. This will 
enable them not to observe the policies made by the Majles. In 
order not to adhere to these regulations devised by their 
general assemblies, government companies have created secondary 
companies. Even the ministries and government establishments 
have established and invested in other companies that appear on 
the surface not to be governmental. For instance, the Iran Steel 
Company has such companies as the Iranian National Steel 
Services Company and Retirement Fund at its side. At a time when 
the entry of cars by government organizations was prohibited, 
the Iranian National Steel Services Company, which appears not 
to be government-related, using the discount on commercial 
taxes, engaged in importing 200 cars to be used in mining 
projects, but in practice a number of them were sold to the 
Social Security Organization. These actions thwart the policies 
set by the Majles. The deputy from Urmia continued: My 
understanding of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
is that we have not made agriculture a central issue as we 
should have. As long as agriculture fails to be a central issue 
and investments in the county are not allocated to this sector, 
we will be obliged to import wheat, rice, meat, and other 
foodstuff from other countries, and subsequently the symptom of 
the migration from villages to cities will continue. 
  Ja'fari added: I agree with bringing the ceiling of the 
budget to the level of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], as 
proposed by the Industries and Mines Committee, because the 
ceiling of the present budget is quite inflationary and, more 
than the previous year, will result in price increases. 
<H5>  Hasan Aminlu, Supporter </H5>
  Another supporter of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget bill was Aminlu, who said: The budget that has been 
ratified this year is not an ideal budget. From our perspective, 
an ideal budget is a budget in which expenditures and revenues 
of the government are gained through taxes and added values and 
the per capita income of the people goes up. [sentence as 
published] We, too, have some criticism about the companies and 
the waste in them. 
  He added: It is necessary to mention that of the 8,000 
billion general government budget, 5,000 billion is in the 
budgets of the companies. We also believe that the supervisory 
dimension has been weak. We also have something to say in 
regards to surface revenues that are created. But this does not 
mean that we do not defend the positive points that exist in 
this year's budget. In the general picture of the budget this 
year and the changes that were made in the Joint Committee, out 
of the R3,600 billion general government budget, about R400 
billion have been deducted from the oil revenues; about R100 
billion have been deducted from the budget of Note 25; and about 
R50 billion of the expenditures sections have been transferred 
to the companies. 
  Of the total 500 billion toman reduction which has resulted 
in the revenues, about 100 billion concerned [Note] 25, and 200 
billion were the result of taxes and other revenues, which is a 
strength for the committee. Another 200 billion tomans has been 
reduced in the ceiling of revenues and general government 
expenditures. 
  He termed the decreased dependency of the budget on oil 
another point of strength for this bill and said: If we continue 
this trend gradually and in future years, the view is that every 
year a percentage of the budget revenues will be detached from 
oil and moved towards other revenues, which will certainly be in 
the interest of budget writing in the country. When our Majles 
dictates to the government that it reduce about 10 percent of 
the ceiling of its exports, it is good in international terms 
that Iran is even satisfied with the ceiling set by OPEC. Also, 
the price per barrel of oil is set lower this year. In Paragraph 
"C," it has been suggested that if oil revenues exceed the 
established ceiling and the value of oil goes up, about $1.3 
billion of the obligations that are set at $1.6 billion in Note 
29, $1.3 billion will be repaid through this same paragraph. 
[sentence as published] Aminlu then pointed out: With the 
changes that have been made in Note 25, first the ceiling that 
was projected was covered; also, it has devised a good policy in 
the electricity section to lessen the pressure on the vulnerable 
and low-income strata. 
  In regards to Note 29, too, good changes have been made. The 
issue of medicine today is one of the problems of the country. 
The Joint Committee in its wisdom has increased foreign currency 
for medicines and allocated $400 million to procure needed 
drugs. Even though this figure still does not meet all the 
pharmaceutical needs for the country, given the existing 
resources of the budget, this ratio for drugs is acceptable. The 
share of essential goods in Note 29 has increased. For students, 
the foreign currency that was not included in the government 
bill has been increased. 
  Referring to the increase in the payment of government 
obligations in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, 
concerning support for the vulnerable strata, he said: In some 
cases, there is support in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget for the vulnerable strata, including payment of 
agricultural subsidies, keeping the price of electricity fixed 
for those with lower consumption, and the creation of a new line 
for the social security of villagers. 
  For the treatment of the vulnerable strata, the amount of 4 
billion tomans has been projected as a new line this year. This 
can be a start for general health insurance, which is on our 
future agenda. Subsidies for essential goods can be effective in 
solving many of the problems of many of the vulnerable strata. 
<H5>  'Abdolrahim Nurbakhsh, Opponent </H5>
  'Abdolrahim Nurbakhsh spoke in opposition to the budget bill 
and said: A comparison of the funds allocated to organizations 
since 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990] shows that funds have 
increased in quantity, but in practice some of the 
organizations, such as education, labor, cooperatives, and 
higher education, have been declining in the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget. I believe that the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget has not been written from a cultural 
perspective, even though our revolution is essentially a 
cultural and ideological revolution. The direction of our budget 
must be towards the expansion of centers of higher education and 
their revitalization. 
  In continuing his speech, emphasizing the expansion of the 
Payam-e Nur University in the deprived areas, he asked that this 
university be strengthened and its present trend prevented. 
  Nurbakhsh also criticized lack of attention to cooperatives 
in the budget bill and said: Today, if we want to have a 
response to the unemployed youth, the only solution is the 
cooperative sector. Unfortunately, the dear ones and the experts 
of the Plan and Budget Organization have paid less attention to 
this issue. If there are unemployed and confused youth in the 
country and we are unable to attract them, what have we 
accomplished for them in connection with the cultural revolution 
in this bill? 
  Then, given the price increases that have been stated in 
Note 
25 along with the tariffs discussed there, in 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] we shall see symptoms resulting from these 
increases, and the heavy burden will be on the shoulders of the 
deprived strata in the society and the unemployed youth who have 
moved towards false jobs. 
<H5>  'Ali Mobini-Dehkordi, Supporting </H5>
  Referring to the policies governing the method of examining 
the revenues, he said: In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget a new policy was devised to force the banking system to 
specify the ceiling of its funds for government and 
nongovernment sectors. Ultimately the change in the net debt of 
government companies and the private sector at the end of 1373 
[20 March 1995] does not exceed 7,000 billion, with the share of 
45 percent and 65 percent allocated to the government sector and 
the private sector, respectively. The funds from the notes in 
the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget amounted to R2,201 
billion. In comparison with the funds in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994], which amounted to R1,782 billion, it has an 
appropriate growth, along with proper policies, growth of 
production, creation of jobs, providing of agricultural 
utilities, providing of the necessary material for carpet 
weaving workshops, and payment of loans to owners of 
residential, commercial, and production units damaged as a 
result of unexpected events. 
  Concerning the revolving funds, he said: The decrease in the 
ceiling of the revolving funds from R2,500 billion to R2,000 
billion and controlling the ceiling of banking funds can harness 
inflation through reducing the volume of cash flow. 
  He also added: Making the revenues realistic; creating 
variety in the revenue resources of the country; creating 
balance; collecting taxes for fundamental services proposed by 
the government; increasing the share of taxes in the total 
budget revenues; supporting domestic products with increased 
tariff percentages; paying attention to the low-income strata of 
the society in devising policies concerning the collection of 
taxes on electricity, natural gas, and kerosene; reducing the 
oil revenues; and reducing the cash flow volume as much as 
possible were among the other intended policies. 
  In continuation, he added: The share of tax revenues in the 
government proposed bill for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
was about 19 percent, which the committee increased to 26 
percent. He added: The total revenues in the government proposed 
budget bill reached R33,593 billion, which the Joint Committee, 
carefully by examining the operation of revenue resources, 
brought to R30,220.8 billion, a decrease of R3,372.2 billion. 
This change was the result of reducing the projected tax 
collection of the government and Note 25 by R414 billion and 
reducing the oil revenues by R4,444 billion. If the share of 
taxes increased by R1,485.9 billion is deducted from it, it will 
reach R2,958 billion. 
  In conclusion, he said: In order to strengthen the financial 
and revenue discipline of the country and direct the government 
companies in such a way that the revenue-generating activities 
of government companies and executive organizations are 
appropriately devised and coherent with the general revenues and 
the general Treasury so as not to cause a decrease in taxes and 
the profit of government shares, the government must be obliged, 
on the basis of imports in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], 
to set the commercial taxes on imported goods at a level that 
will at least retain the projected revenues. 
<H5>  'Abbas Sheybani, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent of the Planning and Budget Committee 
report 
said in a speech: Note 25 has no other use but to put pressure 
on poor people. Set aside every project that is involved. 
Suppose all of our oil wells were hit. In fact, go after an 
economy without oil. Why are you so dependent on oil, which we 
should be selling at $50 and they buy for $10? My suggestion is 
that the Majles vote to reduce it by 500,000 barrels per day 
[bpd], which will certainly drive the price up. 
  He continued: [As a member of] a Majles in which more than 
135 members have signed not to have high prices, Mr. President, 
as long as the shadow of the leader is over our head, I promise 
the vulnerable strata that we will not ratify any high prices. 
Our duty is to live with the resources that we have. We should 
wait for two years and not accept any new projects. 
  Dr. Sheybani also added: The Majles will by no means condone 
high prices. Let the government go and correct the situation. 
Let it get rid of those companies that operate at a loss. You 
cannot fix management by raising prices. 
  He continued: We wanted to raise the price of bread somewhat 
early in the revolution. In the middle of the night, the Imam 
sent a message, "You do not have the right to raise the prices. 
And from now on, if you want to raise the price of anything, it 
must be with my own permission." 
  In the way that we follow the Imam, we follow that leader. 
The leader himself said in his directives, Do not do anything 
that would harm the vulnerable strata. 
  He said: I suggest that we reduce [oil production] by 
500,000 
bpd and reduce current expenditures by 20 percent. 
<H5>  Asadollah Razavi, Supporter </H5>
  The next supporter was the deputy from Kerman, who said: In 
the budget presented by the government, the general revenue and 
other sources of funds amount to R33,767 billion, which shows an 
increase of about 43 percent compared to last year. The Joint 
Committee has reduced this amount by R2,143 billion, which is 
still a growth of 34 percent. This decrease is mainly due to the 
sale of oil, as about 2 million has been reduced from the oil 
exports and one dollar less is calculated in its price. 
  He continued: This year, considering the total oil 
production 
in the world and the likelihood of the entry of Iraq into the 
oil market as well as the level of production of non-OPEC 
countries next year increasing or decreasing and what conclusion 
the OPEC countries will reach in regards to the decrease in oil 
exports, there are various probabilities. The average price of 
Iranian oil for export is projected at $9-17 per barrel. Given 
all this, the price per barrel and the number ratified by the 
committee seem reasonable. In connection with factors that have 
been effective in reducing this figure, Razavi said: In 
Paragraph 1 of Note 22, the total commercial and foreign 
currency policies of the country in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] must be such that the total of foreign currency 
obligations of the country from all sources by the end of 1373 
[20 March 1995] will be $1.6 billion less than at the beginning 
of 1373 [21 March 1994]. 
  In connection with the increase in the price of gasoline in 
Note 25, he said: The increase in the price of gasoline, 
considering the projected inflation, must reach a minimum, and 
this minimum has been set at R30 in the committee. 
<H5>  Seyyed Ahmad Rasulinezhad, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent was Rasulinezhad the deputy of Damavand 
and 
Firuzkuh, who spoke in regards to the elimination of subsidies 
and increase in prices and said: You think that the increase in 
the price of fuel will not bring more pressure on the weak 
strata. On the average, the increase in the price of gasoline 
will certainly result in the increase in the price of 
transportation and goods that reach the consumers, and other 
instances of this kind. 
  He emphasized: It should be examined to see what amount of 
money these companies have received this year from the people 
and the Treasury and how they have operated. An insignificant 
amount may be added to the salaries of employees, women, and 
salary earners from the increase in prices, but the prices go up 
tremendously, by several times. 
  Rasulinezhad mentioned the unjust distribution of the budget 
and said: Some of the views have caused a number of regions and 
provincial cities to be deprived of the attention of the 
government in the proposed bill. For example, the cities of the 
province of Tehran, which tolerate a significant part of the 
pressures and burden of Greater Tehran, and due to being located 
next to the capital of the country, we must witness the 
elimination of developmental projects despite the vital role of 
some of them. I say to the planners and the Plan and Budget 
Organization that pressure on the cities around Tehran and the 
severance of government services and developmental projects 
cause more pressure on the city of Tehran and increase problems. 
  He then said: The efforts of the Joint Committee to reduce 
foreign obligations are not sufficient. It has been said 
frequently that all the existing problems and shortages cannot 
be rectified in a short period of two to three years. We require 
more basic, precise planning and longer calculate time to be 
able to overcome the problems. The government must have more 
control and supervision over the market and prices in order to 
reduce the existing pressure on the deprived and the oppressed. 
<H5>  Karim Zare'i, Supporting </H5>
  The next supporter was Dr. Zare'i, who said: The most 
important strong points of the Joint Committee report consist of 
the use of the directives of the grand leader in drawing the 
main lines of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, 
attention to the wishes of deputies in the pre-agenda speeches, 
the use of views and attention to the opinion of the honorable 
president in the Friday sermons. 
  Then, in connection with agricultural development and 
attention to the export of its products, he said: The only 
sector that has exceeded its obligations in the Five-Year Plan 
has been the agricultural sector, which has seen a significant 
growth. 
  Then, describing the important points of the budget this 
year, he said: In order to harness inflation, in some instances 
necessary subsidies have been allocated to prevent inflation and 
increase prices. Revenues have been realistically noted, and 
customs taxes have increased to support domestic industries 
vis-a-vis luxury goods, prevent the budget from becoming 
inflationary, and pay attention to the poor and low-income 
strata. In Note 3, support for cooperatives continues. Attention 
has been paid to the deprived regions. In Paragraph D of Note 7, 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs has been granted 
permission. [sentence as published] 
  Then he mentioned Note 25 and said: In this note, one of the 
appropriate steps is preventing the increase in the price of 
electricity for agriculture. 
<H5>  Mohammad Naser Tavassolizadeh, Supporter </H5>
  The next supporter was Tavassolizadeh, deputy from Torbat 
Heydariyyeh, who spoke in support of the bill and said: One of 
the characteristics of this bill is that it has significantly 
distanced itself from oil. Previously, the main feature was the 
sale of oil, but now the direction provides hope for the future 
years. 
  In continuation, he said: The consumption of oil in our 
country is three times that of Turkey, six times that of 
Pakistan, and 1.2 times that of China, despite the fact that 
China has a population 20 times that of ours. Hence, we must be 
realistic in our direction and be able to guarantee the future 
of our country. 
  Also considering support for domestic industry among the 
positive points of this plan he added: When we watch the customs 
and close the borders, these are the preparations for 
guaranteeing the independence of our country. 
  Tavassolizadeh said: Unfortunately, less attention has been 
paid in the ratification of the Joint Committee to support for 
medicines for livestock as well as fertilizers and pesticides, 
and the amount is not acceptable. We have seen such policies and 
the harm they have caused our agriculture in the past. 
<H5>  'Ali Mir Karami, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent was Karami, the deputy from Qasr-e Shirin, 
who said in opposing the bill: Unfortunately, the single product 
policy of the country has caused the enemy to have access to our 
weakness and inflict severe blows on the body of this 
revolution, every year the sign of which is the crisis of the 
decrease in the price of oil. 
  He said: the existing cash flow in the hands of some 
individuals in the society in addition to escalating inflation 
will result in economic ailments. The growth of cash must be 
checked with specific leverages, and by devising special taxes 
on revenues and their property, that which must be collected 
legally for the government general revenues as taxes must be 
collected and the way blocked to evade it in any possible manner. 
  In continuation, he said: As the ratification of Note 25 is 
inevitable, first, ways to protect the deprived classes must be 
taken into consideration, and then the increase in prices must 
be taken into consideration. 
<H5>  Ahmad Nikfar, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent was Nikfar the deputy from the city of 
Eqlid. Also, in a speech in connection with writing the budget 
and stating that budget writing must be regional, he said: 
Relations have taken the place of regulations, and considering 
that we were trying to advance the procedure of the distribution 
of the budget at least from now on in a most proper form, we did 
not take any step in this regard. 
  The deputy from Eqlid said: The Majles and deputies in their 
suggestions hoped that the results of that plan would increase 
the authority of the specialized committees in the procedure to 
ratify the budget. What has resulted, unfortunately, was not so. 
It even increased the time that the Majles should spent on the 
budget by several times. 
  Then, in connection with the proposed bill of the 
government, 
he said: (In this bill), ignoring and no attention to the 
deprived regions can be seen. In two notes of the budget of this 
year, on the whole, about 50 billion tomans were given to 
deprived regions which now, in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] budget, this amount has been reduced to 15 billion tomans. 
<H5>  Mohammad Baqer Tavakkoli, Supporter </H5>
  The next supporter was the deputy of Khomeyn, who spoke in 
connection with the budget bill regarding the decrease in the 
level of incomes, the increase in the percentage of taxes, and 
the increase in commercial tariffs, and said: One of the most 
effective issues in inflation is banking funds, which are given 
by banks to government establishments and the private sector. In 
the government bill, about R7,598 billion, at a ratio of 80 
percent for the government sector and 20 percent for the private 
sector, have been set, which has been reduced in the 
examinations of the Joint Committees to R7,000 billion, at a 
ratio of 55 percent for the private sector and 45 percent for 
the government sector, which will help the country thrive. 
  Then, in connection with the increase in subsidies for 
essential goods and medicines, he said: The committee increased 
the amount of foreign currency for medicines from $303 million 
to $400 million. Also, it increased the basic goods from $695 
million to $800 million. 
<H5>  'Ali Naqi Khamushi, Opponent </H5>
  The next opponent was Khamushi, the deputy of Tehran, who 
referred to the foreign currency rate and said: Having received 
the proposed 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget, we 
practically see that the price of foreign currency was increased 
by 20 percent from 145 tomans, and you and I want to approve it. 
Do we know that raising the price of foreign currency equals 
increasing all the prices by 20 percent? 
  He then continued: In current expenditures alone, we have 
50.9-percent growth, which is a shocking figure. It will be to 
no avail to inject rials as the rate of the floating dollar goes 
up, which will result in higher prices of services. 
  The deputy of Tehran continued: Unfortunately, this budget 
includes about 50-60 percent inflation. 
  Khamushi then, in connection with the decrease in the price 
of oil, requested the ceiling of the budget to be reduced to the 
ceiling of the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget. 
  In continuation, he said: If we are able to separate about 
50 
percent from the oil revenues, it can be a first step on the 
path of actual economic independence. 
  The deputy from Tehran referred to the increase in tax 
revenues in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill. 
  In continuation, Khamushi mentioned several statistical 
figures in connection with the percentage of funds in the 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget with regard to 1373 [21 
March 1994-20 March 1995] and added: I ask all the deputies to 
take a bold step toward reaching a healthy economy and 
independence from oil through the budget. 
<H5>  Fatemeh Homeyun-Moqaddam (Supporter) </H5>
  Ms. Fatemeh Homeyun-Moqaddam, the deputy from Tabriz, was 
the 
last supporter of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget 
bill. She said: Today (yesterday), we heard that the board of 
directors of the Majles had a meeting with the honorable grand 
leader in connection with the budget, and he offered the 
necessary directive, to which, God willing, attention will soon 
be paid. I speak in support of the budget, but not that the 
budget has no imperfections. Certainly, what is right with the 
budget will outweigh than its imperfections. In the previous 
years, the budget bill was not viewed realistically, but this 
year it is close. Not that it has become realistic. For example, 
1) relative support for domestic products by increasing the 
customs fees and taxes are among the good aspects of the budget; 
2) support for the oppressed and vulnerable strata by providing 
foreign currency for medicines, foreign currency for essential 
goods, foreign currency for students and the Red Crescent, and 
keeping their prices stable, especially the heartfelt 
contentment of the leader, are among the good aspects of the 
budget; 3) emphasis on the cost of kerosene, electricity, 
telephone, etc.; 4) emphasis on proper and sound tax revenues 
and their change in the government bill by 261 percent is a good 
change; 5) repayment of national obligations is given priority; 
6) in regards to oil and natural gas taxes, there has been a 
logical reaction; 7) severance of dependence on oil; 8) if we 
see the budget independent of oil, we will have taken positive 
steps in the independence of the oil rial. 
<H5>  Mohsen Kuhkan (Opponent) </H5>
  Mohsen Kuhkan the deputy from Lenjan was the last opponent 
to 
the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] national budget bill. In 
justifying his opposition, he asked the experts of the Planning 
and Budget and the Joint Committees to respond to these 
questions. 
  In explaining these reasons, he said: I have always 
questioned why we calculate the percentage of the oil in the 
national budget with regard to the whole budget and say that 
this year we have a percentage of decrease in the use of oil in 
the general budget. [sentence as published] If all at once the 
budget reaches a point that we are able to sell all the oil and 
turn the dollars in for rials and use them in the budget and the 
profit margin is small, could we still say that our dependence 
on oil has decreased? 
  In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], about 58 percent of 
the budget was spent in connection with social issues, including 
higher education, health, and treatment. But in 1372 [21 March 
1993-20 March 1994], it was decreased to 41 percent. This level 
in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] in the proposed budget was 
reduced to 36 percent. In other words, regarding social affairs, 
that part that concerns funds connected with the cultural 
invasion must be seen here as decreasing every year. This is one 
problem in the budget bill. On the other hand, there is an 
increase in miscellaneous expenditures. In 1371 [21 March 
1992-20 March 1993], about 6 percent; in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 
March 1994], 11 percent; and in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995], 12 percent are miscellaneous expenditures. 
  Concerning some of the revenues being unrealistic, Kuhkan 
said: The Joint Committee worked very hard. They reduced the 
dependence of the budget on rials due to the sale of foreign 
currency and lowered it to a level above the ceiling of the 
budget. But, on the other hand, in taxes and some other revenues 
they made increases. 
  Concerning the repayment of the loans of the for-profit 
development projects in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], from 
R31 billion about R8.6 billion materialized, and in the six 
months of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], 26 billion. If in 
the six months of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] it had 
materialized in accordance with the ratification, it should have 
been R26 billion, whereas R3.1 billion materialized. It is 
interesting to know that in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
it increased to R42.6 billion. The sale of barracks in 1371 [21 
March 1992-20 March 1993] was projected at about R45 billion, 
but nothing materialized. The honorable government has not 
stated this in the bill, but the honorable committee has 
specified numbers and figures for this in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995]. Also, with the recession that exists in the baying 
and selling of property and land, you see whether the figures 
you projected in the annual taxes on property are correct or 
not. In 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], the projection was 
about R22 billion, of which R7.1 billion materialized. In the 
second six months of 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], about 8 
billion was projected, of which 3.1 billion materialized. In 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the estimates are the same 
as in 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. Given these problems, 
we do not think that these revenues will materialize. 
<H5>  Statements of the Government Representative </H5>
  Rowghani-Zanjani, the director of planning and budget, in 
defending the budget bill said: If a decision is made in 
connection with the economic policies concerning the change and 
modification of prices and in is dealt with in connection with 
the contractual policies in the budget, it is because of the 
points to which the honorable deputies or I or some of the 
honorable ministers have referred. It is for these reasons that 
this decision has been made. Because we are at a point that 
requires that important and vital decisions be made in order for 
us to pass this period of transition and reach a potential, 
dynamic, acceptable, and ideal economy of the regime of the 
Islamic Republic. 
  He then said: There are two very important notes in the 
bill. 
One is Note 25 and the other Note 29, which are really 
determining and have economic effects in the Second Plan and the 
budget. 
  If there is a quote in connection with Note 25 concerning 
the 
grand leader apparently having certain views and if his opinions 
are final, they must certainly be followed. Likewise, if there 
are other points, this issue is important for us to consider in 
the discussion of the budget, to be aware of this issue and be 
able to open up Note 25 further. 
  The director of the Plan and Budget Organization then, 
pointing out that the share of the oil revenues has not 
increased compared to 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], said: 
We determined the share of oil revenues in the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget law. 
  If the brothers analyze the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 
1994] budget, they will see that we considered nearly $17 
billion for foreign currency and rural revenues. The budget bill 
that has been written and presented by the government for 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995] is about $12.5 billion. In other 
words, we have written $4 billion less than last year. As to why 
the share of oil revenues has gone up, I must say that it has 
not. The budget has become more transparent. 
  Also, in connection with taxes, he said: We think we collect 
high taxes. In fact, now with the oil revenues becoming 
transparent, everyone realizes how our budget relies on oil 
revenues and how it can affect it. You realize that we hardly 
collect any taxes at all. 
  He also said: As to why revenues have increased, it is due 
to 
Note 25, which accounts for nearly R3,000 billion. Also, the 
taxes that the brothers ratified. Part of the implementation of 
the national projects depends on this note, and if this note is 
not implemented, the projects will stop and will even have 
economic effects. 
  In regards to increasing the payment of obligations, 
Rowghani-Zanjani said: We considered $1 billion. But the Joint 
Committee made it $1.6 billion. The increase in this payment 
will have an effect on our economy. It will effect jobs, 
production, imports, exports, investments, cash flow, and 
prices. It is not true that we stand in an ideal position and 
make policies without having any effect. 
  Also, concerning projections of the price of oil, he said: 
It 
is true that we cannot project the price of oil, considering the 
world market. The government has projected $14 per barrel, but 
the brothers in the committee project $13. At the present time, 
with the severe cold in the west and the United States, the 
price of oil has increased. Hence, we think the government's 
projection is more correct. Let us make it $14, and if it does 
not materialize, we can control it in the government. 
  Rowghani-Zanjani added: If the revenues do not materialize, 
we shall not create new obligations, and we will not start the 
projects that are to start. The deputy brothers come to us 
asking why we do not put such-and-such a project up for bidding, 
etc. The reason is that we have no money. 
  He also added: The brothers say high prices and inflation 
must be eliminated, but in items that concern commercial taxes, 
you changed the 8 percent to 18 percent. Certainly, it will be a 
high price for the consumer. We do not oppose supporting 
domestic products, but we must also see the other side of the 
issue.

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Division. After 10 
hours of discussion by supporters and opponents of the budget 
and also the government's defense, the general points of the 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill were ratified. 
  According to a report by our correspondent, Mr. Mas'ud 
Rowghani-Zanjani, in defending the government bill, continuing 
his statements of last night, said: It is appropriate for the 
point to be raised that, as far as we can, we should base the 
cost of the operation of the country on taxes, in other words, 
our administrative system should be based on tax resources. 
  In the Second [Five-Year Development] Plan, the government 
policy is to gradually base the current expenditures on tax 
resources and developmental expenditures on oil resources. This 
cannot be done all at once. 
  Referring to the 50-percent growth of the current sector, 
which was the subject of Mr. Khamushi's discussion, he said: Out 
of 7,000 billion rials[R], R2,027 billion is the difference 
between the foreign currency rate; R19,800 billion, the import 
of oil products; R126 billion, recreational hajj pilgrimages; 
R219 billion, support for the vulnerable strata; R1,300 billion, 
the difference in the price of essential goods; R300 billion, 
subsidies for chemical fertilizer; and R1,046 billion, other 
items. 
  Stating that some of these miscellaneous lines are allocated 
to reconstruction, he pointed out: When there are expenditure 
revenues with which the executive organizations will engage in 
developmental work through the sale of services and goods, they 
must be centralized. This matter must fall within the authority 
of the minister. 
  But in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], our developmental 
budget is 12,600 billion. Of this amount, 3,000 billion concern 
taxes that have been stated in Note 25. Our national projects, 
instead of 6,000 billion this year, have reached R5,551 billion, 
which indicates a 10-percent decrease. On the other hand, we 
increased from 1,300 billion to 1,930 billion. 
  Concerning Notes 29 and 25, Zanjani said: We have nearly $13 
billion in energy consumption. Annually, we import 230,00 
barrels of oil products proposed by the government, which is 1.5 
billion tomans. If we conserve this amount and place it at the 
disposal of the related minister, about R700 billion in banking 
funds will be freed and can be placed at the disposal of the 
private sector. 
  In the continuation of the open session today, Mr. Aqazadeh, 
the minister of oil, defended oil and fuel products in the 1373 
[21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget and said: The OPEC members 
have proposed an oil production ceiling reduction of 5 percent. 
If we succeed, in the next session, we will face the issue of 
price and moving toward increasing revenues. If we do not reach 
an agreement in the next session, we shall operate on the basis 
of our own oil production quota. 
  He then referred to Note 25 of the budget bill and said: 
Today, you pay 1,100 billion tomans in subsidies for fuel. We 
must tell the people to lower fuel consumption, and lower it by 
15 percent. This will solve all the government projections. 
  He also said: If we are able to pay subsidies directly, it 
would be more just. You should do this. It is not right to give 
what is justly the right of the deprived rural people to the 
city people. 
  Concerning Note 25, the minister of petroleum said: Today, 
the elimination of Note 25 does not just mean the elimination of 
Note 25. Rather, it will destroy the refinery in Bandar 'Abbas. 
Or, you will have to take 37 billion tomans from the budget of 
other regions and attach it to the Bandar 'Abbas project, which 
is not possible. 
  Concerning the proposed natural gas increase in the proposed 
government bill, he said: If the price of natural gas remains 
fixed at R8, we cannot add another rial for the next 10 years. 
Now, the increase is R2 or R3. If we are unable to change it 
slightly every year, we will have problems in the future. 
  Now, a 2- or 3-rial increase in the price of natural gas is 
not tangible. But in five years, we will have to increase it by 
4 or 5 tomans, which will be impossible. 
  Aqazadeh said: If you eliminate Note 25, you will also have 
to decide what I must do in that ministry. 
  Engineer Zangeneh, the minister of energy emphasized in 
defending the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget: 
According to the ratification of the joint committee, up to 500 
kwh of electricity used in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
will not be subject to any increase, and this level of 
consumption includes 96.36 percent of residential customers. 
  Concerning the elimination of the projects of Note 29 in the 
joint committee, he said: In this case, we do not know what is 
most reasonable to do. A low-rate loan has been assumed earlier, 
and in Farvardin 1373 [21 March-20 April 1994] another must be 
assumed. This is an economic matter and will be followed by many 
foreign currency savings. These are among the affairs of which 
the implementation was permitted in the First Plan. 
  He said: If investments are not made in electricity, 
tomorrow 
will be too late. No investment can respond all at once, it 
takes at least three to four years. In other words, a solution 
must be found before serious problems arise. 
  Gharazi, the minister of post, telegraph [and telephone], 
said in defense of the bill: Experts try to put before you the 
plans they have devised for the future administration of the 
country that actually account for the next 10, 15, or 20 years. 
  Gharazi asked the deputies to deal with the issues in the 
budget bill from an expert and not an emotional standpoint. He 
continued: Some say, what is the use of selling oil at $10 and 
spending $3 on it? If we make this $3 [a] domestic [expenditure] 
and not spend it on oil, this will be a very beautiful expert 
action in the country, which the government has accomplished 
after several years. The fact that this issue is being discussed 
today is the result of government expertise. 
  After the statements of the minister of post, telegraph [and 
telephone], the general points of the bill were put to a vote 
and the general points of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] 
budget bill were ratified with a decisive majority vote. 
<H5>  Statements of the Speaker of the Majles </H5>
  Prior to voting on the general points of the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] budget, Mr. Nateq-Nuri, the speaker of the 
Majles, spoke in connection with the statements of Engineer 
Gharazi and said: We had questions for the gentlemen. One 
question is, is what you are saying ultimately price increases 
or taxes? It is not that we did not understand and have 
discussed it emotionally. 
  Then, in regards to Engineer Yahyavi's reference to quoting 
from the grand leader concerning Note 25, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Nateq-Nuri said: Because these viewpoints affect your decisions, 
we should know if he has an opinion about a particular paragraph 
or note. "He should just make a gesture and we shall hasten to 
it." We have no problem in this regard. 
  In order to clarify the matter, his honor was asked about 
it. 
He responded: "I have not expressed any opinion in regards to 
eliminating Note 25." Rather, the interpretations have been 
different. We asked the office; he said: If I have an opinion 
about the budget and want it to be announced to the Majles, I 
will do so officially through the speaker of the Majles. 
  While apologizing to Yahyavi, the deputy from Tehran, he 
said: In any case, our interpretations of the speech may be 
different.

  [Text] With the approval of the total figure for government 
revenues, the first consultation of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 
March 1995] budget bill has been approved by the deputies. 
  The Central News Unit reports that Article 1 of next year's 
budget bill has been approved in its first consultation and at 
yesterday's open Majles session. 
  In terms of revenues and other credit sources and in terms 
of 
expenses and other payments, the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 
1995] national budget is more than 69,772,752,987,000 rials[R]. 
  In terms of revenues and expenses the government's general 
budget is more than R32,330,350,987,000. 
  General revenues and other sources of credit approved and 
set 
by the Majles amount to R30,480,946,179,000, revenues allocated 
to the ministries and government institutions are 
R2,254,404,808,000, and the budget for the government companies, 
banks and profit-making institutions affiliated with the 
government is more than R45,453,090,000,000 in terms of revenues 
and other sources for credits. 
  Based on Article 1 as approved, foreign exchange revenues 
from the sale of crude oil in excess of $10,154,300,000 up to 
$11.48 billion will be used to repay the nation's foreign 
exchange commitments, and anything in excess of that will be 
used to carry out the projects given in this law and to make up 
the credit shortages for allocated development projects. 
  This report states that the expert from the Plan and Budget 
Commission explained the changes made in the revenues section of 
the budget. He said: The national budget has decreased about 
$10,000 billion [as published] and the general budget has also 
decreased about R3,700 billion compared to the bill proposed by 
the government, and the net change that will have to be made in 
next year's budget for the second consultation is about R2,220 
billion.

<F P=106> [Sermon by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli on 13 </F>
March on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Thanks be to God, prayers and peace be upon the 
messenger of God, the seal of prophets who has exchanged these 
two days of 'Id al-Fitr for two days of the Jahiliyah [the 
pre-Islam era of Ignorance]. This 'Id and the one that follows 
it were days of indulgence, leisure, and pleasure during the era 
of the Jahiliyah. [passage omitted 
  The qiblah means having the same direction. By direction I 
do not mean that Muslims face from west to east, or from east to 
west, or from north to south, or from south to north, but that 
they move towards a single aim. Proof of that is that Muslims 
used to face another direction from the south to the north; 
[words indistinct] that they used to achieve their aim [word 
indistinct] from the qiblah, which is the single aim. Muslims 
in the eastern and western parts of the land are nowadays in 
dire need of a united aim and united direction. However, 
nowadays they give the appearance and look as if they are moving 
towards one qiblah, whereas in fact they have different qiblahs. 
What we see now is a kind of hypocrisy and false appearances. 
Yesterday more than a million people were praying in the Holy 
House [Kaaba in Mecca] while tens were at the same time being 
slaughtered in the al-Ibrahimi mosque in usurped Palestine. All 
that they offered were urgent calls and prayers, which neither 
helps nor hurts those who are being massacred in the al-Ibrahimi 
mosque. 
  Muslims ought to have marched from Mecca to Jerusalem, to 
liberate it, and to al-Ibrahimi mosque to rescue the hundreds of 
praying men who were laid open to slaughter at dawn. [passage 
omitted] 
  He who wanted paradise during these moments ought to have 
gone to Palestine to take revenge on the Zionists who shun 
nothing to eliminate Muslims. Even a doctor was armed with a 
machine gun. The Christian world, which failed to protest, 
laments if a Jew of a Christian is killed by Muslims or others. 
The Christian, Catholic world did not lift a finger. More 
still, the so-called UN Security Council has so far obstructed 
the adopting of a resolution even to just condemn this hideous 
slaughter. America told them that condemning Israel is 
forbidden, that the carrying out of chapter 7 against the 
Israelis is forbidden, the Israelis are above the UN charter. 
[passage omitted] 
  From now on the Americans have no right to speak about human 
rights, or about Christ, or ethics, or humanity. They have 
backed with all strength the slaughter of the al-Ibrahimi 
mosque. Jews have also dropped the fig leaf, now that it has 
become clear that they arm doctors. [passage omitted] 
  Suddenly we find a surgeon carrying a machine gun and 
attacks 
worshippers inside the sacred al-Ibrahimi mosque at dawn. The 
United States stated that if you want to denounce anybody, you 
should restrict your condemnation against this surgeon. The 
president of the Jews addressed the world and said that we are 
sorry for this massacre committed by a deranged person. Then 
this statement was reported by the mass media, the coward 
no-Arab mass media; they showed photographs of this doctor who 
was filmed on several occasions carrying a machine gun, 
addressing groups of Jews, and inciting them to take revenge on 
Muslims and avenge a Jewish woman who was killed in one of the 
streets. 
  Unfortunately, neither the Arab nor the Muslim delegates nor 
the coward Arab governmental mass media dared to expose this 
reality. Nobody, apart from the Libyan delegate, told the 
Security Council that this doctor was not insane; that in the 
past he was shown to the whole world on television screens 
carrying a machine gun and addressing masses from Jewish 
occupying settlers. What other justification is left to the 
United States now; it is being accused by the world. I am not 
talking here about the coward governmental official world, the 
traitor and the world that has been bought up. No, I am 
referring to the free world, to the masses, the peoples, the 
free mass organizations; the international conscience and the 
conscience of humanity; the genuine religion, the true 
Christianity; the true Judaism and the genuine Islam. What can 
the United States say when it is being told that you officially 
sponsor terrorism and protect terrorists? 
  From this very day, the United States has no right to talk 
about those who protect terrorism, human rights, the states 
which sponsor terrorism. No other country can match the United 
States when it comes to sponsoring terrorism; it is followed by 
Western states and Christianity in this matter. 
  We would like to remind the Islamic nation of what we told 
it 
a short whole ago. This is a Jewish-Christian alliance, there 
is no doubt about it. It is banging the drums of a crusade war. 
In parallel, we are forced, out of self-defense, to sound bells 
of confrontation and defense of ourselves and homes. This is 
because we are facing barbaric and savage nations that worship 
idols, crucify Christ, arm surgeons, and block attempts of the 
international organization [UN] to condemn the aggression and 
denounce barbarism, savagery, and mass annihilation of a 
defenseless people, whose sole crime lies in the fact that it is 
defending its land and its right to live on earth. [passage 
omitted] 
  The new world order means that Jews and Christians control 
Muslims and if they can, they will after that dominate 
Confucianism and other religions in India, China, and Japan. 
[passage omitted] 
  What the Christians and Jews are now saying: We were 
determined to crush Communism and we must now crush Islam and 
Confucianists. 
  Now, we hope to see a confrontation between China that heads 
the Confucianist camp and America that heads the Christian 
crusader camp. We have no justifications but to be biased 
against the crusaders. We are standing with Confucianism, and 
by allying ourselves with it and fighting alongside it in one 
international front, we will eliminate our mutual opponent. 
  So, we, as Muslims, will support China in its struggle 
against our mutual enemy. [passage omitted] 
  We wish it China victory, we support it and call on all 
small, enslaved, and intimidated peoples to unite with the 
anti-crusaders' camp because the crusade beats the drums of war. 
We are beating the drums of confrontation in preparation for 
the defense of the honor of Islam and sanctity of Muslims. 
[passage omitted] 
  We are amazed, in fact, to see those who claim to embrace 
Islam and claim to serve and defend it taking the Jews and the 
Christians as guardians in an open violation of the very Koran 
that they claim to have faith in. 
  The Koran says: Ye who believe take not the Jews and the 
Christians for your friends and protectors. They are friends 
and protectors to each other. 
  This has happened. America is the protector of Israel, 
Israel is the protector of America. They are friends and 
protectors to each other, this is true. 
  How can you, the Muslim, take those as [Awliya'] responsible 
for your affairs, befriend and ally with them, and still claim 
to be a Muslim? This is blasphemy, hypocrisy, and deception of 
the Muslims. [passage omitted] 
  How can a Muslim, an Arab state be an ally of America? What 
Islam are they left with? Such a state is a hypocrite and 
immoral, ruled by a despot, outside Islam, charlatan, liar, 
Musaylimah the Liar [Islamic figure who pretended to be a 
prophet]. [passage omitted] 
  We can say that a Muslim ruler who is a friend, an ally to 
America, whose guardian is America, we can say to him: You are 
an unbeliever, a Christian, and a Jew. [passage omitted] 
  There are Muslims who send forces to Somalia to cover the 
slaughtering of the Arab Muslim Somali people by the American 
forces. This is blasphemy. Any one alongside the Christian 
forces in Somalia is an unbeliever. This is what God says, not 
us. 
  Some believers said: America is with us, Israel is not with 
us, France is with us and so is Britain; you want us not to have 
these as guardians, what will we do then. Well, God said: Your 
guardian is God, his messenger, and the believers. What more do 
you want than God. 
  God said: I am your guardian; he is stronger than America. 
[passage omitted] 
  Their guardian is God, his messenger, and the believers. 
[passage omitted] 
  From this sacred place and on this great day, I address 
myself to our brothers who have put themselves in the service of 
the Jews and the Christians to return to the fold soon, and we 
say to the Islamic Conference Organization and the Islamic 
nation that an Islamic people, the Libyan people, on orders from 
America, Britain, and France, is prohibited from performing the 
rites of pilgrimage, the pilgrimage that takes place in an Arab 
land. 
  We tell our brothers of the Islamic nation, we draw their 
attention to the difficult situation of the sacred House of God 
[The Kaaba, in Mecca], concerning which the falsified Security 
Council resolutions were implemented with American threat. They 
had been implemented on Holy Mecca and the tomb of the Prophet. 
When an airplane takes off from Libya, it is not allowed to 
cross Saudi air space or to land while carrying pilgrims to 
Mecca and Medina. 
  Our brothers who are standing in the pilgrims way and who 
are 
preventing us from arriving for pilgrimage are in an unenviable 
situation. The poor, they are in such a situation that we do 
not want to put more pressure on them, nor do we want to further 
expose them. Perhaps it is their economic conditions, spiritual 
and material weakness, their helplessness, and their limited 
perception that have made them seek protection with the American 
White House, and obliged them to carry out the decisions of the 
Christian states against the pilgrimage and pilgrims. But at 
the same time, we say that America ought to be grateful to the 
Arabs, to the white hand [symbol of assistance] that was 
extended to it in time of need. [passage omitted] 
  America is in a situation of difficulty and distress. The 
Arab helping hand was extended to it. It should have kissed 
this hand, and the American President should have bowed to the 
Saudi king who handed out 6 billion [currency not specified] to 
America in an historic transaction that saved America from a 
crushing economic crisis. 
  Yesterday, Saudi Arabia concluded a transaction to the 
value of 6 billion dollars for the purchase of civil aircraft 
that Saudi Arabia does not need. However, the Arab legendary 
generosity made Saudi Arabia extend a helping hand to America at 
a difficult time. 
  The Americans should recognize the Saudi good deed, because 
it saved 100,000 American employees who were going to be made 
redundant and become beggars on the pavements of American 
streets. The 6 billion dollars confirmed 100,000 people in 
their jobs. These people were on the brink of becoming beggars. 
America should respond positively to the rank of the Saudi king 
whenever he requests anything from it. When he exerted every 
effort to mediate in the confrontation between Libya, America, 
Britain, and France, they rejected his mediation and did not 
meet his request, while he had done them favors and he has got 
influence. [passage omitted] It seems that our brothers in 
Saudi Arabia are implementing this noble saying of the prophet 
and consider that the American hand stretched out to them to beg 
for money needs to be helped. 
  We can only address the Islamic Conference Organization, 
that 
includes more than 40 Islamic countries, and tell them that 
Mecca is in a difficult situation because the Security Council 
resolutions were imposed on it. Muslims must be informed by the 
Libyans who were banned from pilgrimage for two or three years. 
Despite all this, we are showing patience and forgiveness. We 
are implementing Almighty God's saying: Let not detestation for 
a people who barred you from the holy mosque move you to commit 
aggression. Help one another to piety and Godfearing, do not 
help each other to sin and enmity. 
  This has become a fact: People have barred us from the holy 
mosque. These are Arabs: Those on the way and those who have 
the holy mosque on their land. This, like God said, should not 
push us to enmity and rupture with them. 
  We do take note of their difficult circumstances and their 
weakness in front of the U.S. monster. They acknowledge the 
dominance of Christianity and Judaism, and the alliance of the 
Zionist and the crusade. They are afraid that they might be the 
target of God's punishment, consequently, they put pressure on 
their Libyan brothers; they prevent them from visiting the holy 
places as a favor to satisfy the Christian states. [passage 
omitted] 
  I hope that such acts would not provoke you into attacking 
your brothers in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, or Egypt because these 
people have been targeted, and their turn will come to side with 
the West and the U.S. against Libya, they are forced to bow 
because of their circumtances. Regarding Egypt, its economic 
situation is a dire one, so one should not blame it; it needs a 
helping hand and support. It is being targeted, and there is a 
Zionist-Jewish-Christian plot to balkanize Egypt and divide it 
into several states; war has been declared against Egypt now, 
Egypt is being fought from within, in its streets. Orders are 
given from Tel Aviv, Washington, Paris, London, Bonn, and 
Berlin. Orders are given from Christian and Jewish capitals to 
destroy Egypt and Algeria. 
  Egypt's economic conditions do not allow it to oppose the 
United States during the current phase, therefore, we should 
unite with Egypt, support Egypt's economy, and take advantage 
from Egypt's backing for our economy; we should be strong to 
emerge from the phase of weakness to the phase of strength. Then 
and then only, Egypt can stand up to the United States and stand 
up to other countries. 
  As for Sudan, likewise its economic circumstances are very 
bad; war was declared against it from the south; they created 
poisonous insects for it, which they refer to in their language 
as (?Niania). They stressed that they should sow the poisonous 
insect in southern Sudan. You must have heard of Niania 1, 
Niania 2, and Niania 3. Every now and then a movement emerges in 
the south to destroy Sudan. This plot is being hatched by the 
Jews and the Christians to target Sudan, prevent unity between 
Egypt and Sudan, and weaken Sudan. Even Sudan is in a very 
difficult situation. 
  However, the country that is going through a completely 
different situation is your sisterly Saudi Arabia. Economically 
speaking, Saudi Arabia does not need the United States; the 
latter does not provide Saudi Arabia with any economic support. 
On the contrary, it is Saudi Arabia that is providing economic 
backing to the United States, as we all know. As you have 
witnessed, it has just supplied it with 6 billion dollars in 
return for planes that Saudi Arabia does not need. 
  If Saudi Arabia needed to rely on the United States to 
defend 
it, we would like to ask the following question: To defend it 
against whom? Now, Saudi Arabia claims that Iraq represents a 
danger against Saudi Arabia. If Saudi independence depends on 
U.S. forces, this kind of independence is a hollow one, because 
the United States can withdraw its forces at any time; and 
because there may be a U.S. Administration that does not agree 
with the principle of defending Saudi Arabia. Hence, Saudi 
Arabia should unite with Iraq. 
  If Kuwait independence depends on the presence of U.S. 
troops 
in the country, it should unite with Iraq, or with Saudi Arabia, 
or Jordan, or Libya. 
  Libya tells the truth, it says that the Libyan Army, with 
its artillery, tanks, or radar equipment, cannot fight NATO. 
Therefore, Libya stresses that the Arabs' strength lies in their 
unity. Libya's independence remains a fragile one as long as 
there is no Arab unity from the Atlantic to the Gulf. This 
unity will become a deterrent force against the greedy Western 
colonizers; we are used to their greed, aggression and lack of 
mercy. 
  We are saying...[pause] We are calling for immediate unity. 
We cannot rely on other forces. When the Soviet Union still 
existed, it made a request to set up military bases in Libya to 
protect Libya from the United States. We rejected that. We 
said that that was not acceptable: If our independence is 
dependent on your presence in our territory, that will not be 
independence. It would mean that we have sold independence. 
The other side will take us when you withdraw your forces. 
Therefore, this is not a solution. The solution lies in the 
unity of the Arab people. 
  We know that Saudi Arabia needs the United States in the 
military, political, and security spheres. However, the United 
States needs Saudi Arabia even more economically. What is 
preventing our brothers in Saudi Arabia from being bold with the 
United States. The United States should at least accept their 
views. We cannot accept this situation for our brothers in 
Saudi Arabia. We want our brothers in Saudi Arabia to have a 
voice in the West, to be heard, to have a standing, and able to 
threaten with gasoline and their deposits in the United States, 
Western countries and the companies that work there, and make 
thousands of billions in profit. [passage omitted] 
  In this time of revolutionary Islamic awakening -- this 
revival in Libya, this renaissance, this return of awareness, 
the setting up of the Shura, the community system in the 
religious sense -- this humbug and this nonsense by the 
Islamists has no place here. 
  Amazingly, after Zionism carried out these massacres [Hebron 
massacre] they want to reward it by lifting the economic boycott 
against it; and yesterday France goes to reach a military 
agreement with it Israel to supply it with weapons; and they 
besiege Iraq, and besiege Sudan, and besiege Syria, and besiege 
Libya, and forbid it to hold weapons. They want us to turn to 
stones and the Jews turn to weapons of mass destruction. Look! 
The Arabs are forbidden to buy weapons, technology is forbidden 
to them; while with the Jews, the Christian countries are 
competing to supply them with the most modern weapons. 
Yesterday, France signed an agreement with the Israelis in 
return for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Look at this French 
agreement! Look at this blatant alliance in front of humanity 
between Christianity and Judaism against Muslims! If there was 
any nation with a conscience, it would break off relations with 
France, and punish and destroy France. In return for that, I 
heard that the people of Tobruk had decided that they would 
rather get their water on donkeys or on their backs, than accept 
a desalination plant that a French company was to build for 28 
million [currency not specified]. It is impossible -- a French 
company -- God is Great, Oh yes! Salutations to the inhabitants 
of Derna [corrects himself] to the inhabitants of Tobruk. 
[passage omitted] 
  France also even refused to solve its problem with Libya 
over 
its aircraft in solidarity with America and Britain. It said 
that we [words indistinct] solve our problem with Libya in 
solidarity with our brothers, the Americans and the English. 
Yesterday, they reached a military agreement with the Israelis, 
to support them militarily. And the Arabs continue to deal with 
France, except for the inhabitants of Tobruk. [passage omitted] 
  We celebrate this 'Id and we -- many happy returns -- and we 
have declared and legislated for the implementation of the 
Islamic Shari'ah in all the matters covered by the rules of the 
Koran. Every single matter for which the Koran says the rule is 
thus, a law was issued and implemented in this country. Libya 
is thus implementing the Book of God and takes the path of the 
Prophet's practical traditions [sunna]. 
  We who reject -- and call on our brother to reject -- the 
wrong and dangerous slogan of land for peace, address ourselves 
not to the governments -- the governments are helpless -- we 
address ourselves today to worshipers like you in any part of 
the Arab homeland to reject this dangerous slogan -- land for 
peace -- that gives the Israelis the right to occupy any Arab 
land and not withdraw from it unless they get what they want. 
This is a precedent: We occupy your land, we know its your 
land, we occupy it and will not leave until you recognize us. 
This is what happened. 
  Now they are telling Syria the Golan Heights is our land 
that 
we have occupied in 1967 and will not leave it unless you 
recognize us. America on her part said Israel has the right, 
imagine. 
  America demands from Lebanon, whose territory is occupied, 
to stop the fighting in the south of Lebanon. Syria, they have 
been saying, is a terrorist state because it did not act as a 
policeman to protect Israeli's northern borders. Imagine. 
[passage omitted] 
  Look at this injustice; the land for peace. 
  I am talking today at this place as an imam to the Muslims 
just like any other Muslim who led the Muslims at this day at 
any place be it in Mecca, in Madina, in al-Azhar, or at Hassan 
II Mosque, or anywhere in the Arab and Islamic homeland. Hence, 
we are not directing our words to the rulers because I am 
neither a ruler nor a president. I am at this hour an imam to 
those praying at this sacred place. We address our words to our 
Muslim brothers everywhere of the Arab and Islamic homeland with 
the Islamic spirit, the spirit of challenge and with this 
awareness and exposition of truths. 
  Everyone of us has become capable to firmly carry his arms 
and stand in defiance because he has become aware. He has 
learned the triviality of the Christians and the Jews and their 
exposed alliance, and has learned the lie of human rights and 
learned the meaning of terrorism. Namely, he who defends his 
occupied land is a terrorist, and he who defends his honor is a 
terrorist, and he who defend his home is a terrorist. If this 
is terrorism then we are terrorists. If they were threatening 
us by cutting off the oil, we sincerely wish that the Western 
countries and America would force the Security Council to cut 
off oil exports from Libya and no one would buy Libyan oil. 
Then we would be without oil, without electricity, and without 
factories. What would we then be? We would be real fighters 
and underground terrorists like the Irish Republican Army, the 
Red Army, the Kurds, and the Vietnamese. We will appear from 
underground. He who has no factory is the brave one. He who 
has no electricity is the brave one. Look at the Irish 
Republican Army that has no factories and has nothing to worry 
about and has turned London international airport into flames. 
The main airport of Great Britain is in flames and for 48 hours 
was under bombardment from the Irish Republican Army. They 
could not fight it. 
  Neither the American missiles, nor the American aircraft 
carrier, nor Britain's fleets or air force could stop the 
bombardment on its main airport in London, like France's 
international airport. Britain is unable to find out the source 
of the bombardment, people from underground. 
  They want to turn us into real terrorists, we welcome this. 
The day we no longer have oil, we will abandon their false 
civilization and live under trees and in caves, then we will 
fight them (?for sure). They are turning us into real fighters, 
fair enough, we will be patient for so many years in order to 
fight them. Once we defeat them, we go back to building 
factories, roads, and anything else. 
  If they want to deprive us of oil, we welcome this because 
this will make us seek revenge and turn us into fighters. We 
will not have anything to fear anymore. We will be living in 
the bush. We will turn into tigers and lions. 
  This is true. We have talked about them, what Malik [leader 
of one of the four Sunni confessions] had said about wine; he 
rejected and outlawed it. The solution is to address praying 
people, Muslims, and citizens like us. May God...[interrupted 
by cheering masses] God is great. May God give us a firm 
foothold and make us victorious against the unfaithful.

  [Text] A faction leader in Somalia, General Mohamed Hersi, 
generally known as General Morgan, was scheduled to arrive in 
Nairobi today to prepare for a meeting of Somali factions. The 
meeting will discuss the troubled Kismaayo region. 
  The port of Kismaayo is contested by two warlords, General 
Mohamed Hersi and Colonel Omar Jays, the main ally of south 
Mogadishu's strongman, General Mohamed Farah Aidid. Morgan is 
the son-in-law of deposed Mohamed Siad Barre. 
  The meeting comes amid fears that the departure at the end 
of 
this month of United States and other peacekeeping troops from 
Somalia will lead to renewed civil war, with Kismaayo as one of 
the main danger zones. 
  In a related development, efforts by KTN to find out the 
fate 
of a Kenyan attached to the UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM], 
John Wanjohi, who was kidnapped in Mogadishu, were fruitless. 
Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they had 
unsuccessfully tried to get information from the UNOSOM office. 
Wanjohi and a New Zealander, Wayne Hargreaves, were reportedly 
seized from their vehicles in Mogadishu yesterday.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 11 March -- The vice president and 
minister for planning and national development, Professor George 
Saitoti, this morning released the much-awaited Kenya population 
census for 1989. Prof. Saitoti told the press at the Treasury 
Building that volume one of the census which was launched 
contains data by district at sublocation level. It also 
describes population by sex and age, by sex and education, by 
sex age and literacy and by tribe. 
  The vice president allayed some speculation that the 
government had anything to hide on the census figures. He 
asserted that the truth is that the govenrment was concerned 
that in a number of areas, wananchi [citizens] reported that 
they were not reached at all by census enumerators. However, he 
reiterated, whereas the national average for undercount was 6.3 
percent for some districts, the undercount was more significant, 
comparing favorably [as heard] with other censuses in the world. 
He cited the U.S. 1990 mail census with an undercount of 15 
percent recorded. 
  According to the report recorded as per August 1989, the 
population figure stood at 21,443,636 comprised of 10,628,368 
males and 10,815,268 famales. The Rift Valley Province leads 
with 4,981,613, followed by Eastern 3,768,677, Nyanza 3,507,162, 
Central 3,116,703, Western 2,544,329, Coast 1,829,191, Nairobi 
1,324,570 and Northeastern Province with 371,391. [passage

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali and the 
defense minister, Mr. Aftab Shaban Mirani, flew into Mogadishu 
from Nairobi today to celebrate 'Id al-Fitr [Muslim festival] 
with Pakistani troops in Somalia. Commander of Pakistan's 
contingent Brigadier (Soleh Dabbaf) and other UN officers 
greeted the Pakistani leaders at the airport. Later, they were 
flown by a helicopter to the Pakistani brigade headquarters 
situated at the Mogadishu University campus. PTV correspondent 
Sarvar Munir Rao says Mogadishu gives the look of a ghost city 
with devastation all around. At the brigade headquarters, Brig. 
(Soleh Dabbaf) gave a detailed briefing regarding deployment of 
Pakistan troops and their area of responsibility. He said 
Pakistan's soldiers are performing their duties with zeal and 
enthusiasm in an area which is not only the largest but also 
difficult and challenging. In the evening, the foreign minister 
and defense minister will visit the newly established Pakistani 
UN hospital and meet the UN force commander, Lieutenant General 
(Abu Sama bin-Bakr).

  [Text] It was not easy for His Majesty King Husayn to 
remain captive to the political equation produced by the Gulf 
crisis, especially since the crisis has gotten worse and taken a 
very serious turn. The crisis and its after effects have mixed 
up politics and religion. Consequently, the political crisis 
has enveloped Islamic shrines. King Husayn has repeatedly 
cautioned and warned against mixing politics with religion. 
Further, King Husayn has on more than one occasion called for 
keeping holy places away from "political action". He said 
sovereignty over those shrines, be they on the land of Hejaz 
[Saudi Arabia] or in the Palestinian territories, should be for 
God alone and not for any political side or state, whatever its 
standing. 
  It can be said that his majesty's performance of the minor 
pilgrimage on al-Qadr Night [27th of Ramadan] despite the 
political crisis overshadowing Saudi-Jordanian relations, was a 
practice of what his majesty has been preaching. Through his 
pilgrimage, King Husayn sought to deliver a message that 
sovereignty over holy shrines is for God and that the political 
dispute between Riyadh and Amman does not mean his majesty will 
remain deprived of his right to visit the land of Hejaz and the 
tomb of his great grandfather, Prophet Muhammad. 
  Therefore, many observers viewed his majesty's pilgrimage 
trip as a political step in religious guise. This step was 
meant to separate holy shrines from politics, which always harms 
the value, importance, and sanctity of holy shrines. 
  It can be further said that King Husayn's pilgrimage trip 
last week has laid down a new principle and important tradition 
in inter-Arab relations and in the link between religion and 
politics. This new principle ends "the monopoly of politicians 
over religious cards". It also opens the door wide to the 
prospect of turning holy sites into public property, away from 
the private standards set by the party holding monopoly over 
these sites, especially since these private standards are 
subject to change. 
  Observers think King Husayn's step will mark a precedent 
that 
can be depended upon to devise a new formula for relations among 
brothers, based on a new principle stipulating that "political 
differences should not prevent the parties to the dispute from 
performing their religious duties. In fact, these duties could 
improve ties when politics is unable to play its role." 
  Despite this image, which King Husayn's step created in the 
minds of observers the world over, government sources have told 
SHIHAN that when King Husayn decided to perform the minor 
pilgrimage he had no political gains in mind. His aim was to 
reestablish contact between himself and the land of Hejaz, with 
which he is inseparably linked, avoiding "political complexities 
and calculations." 
  The sources pointed out, however, that they had expected a 
meeting to take place, on the sidelines of the visit, between 
His Majesty King Husayn and King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
custodian of the two holy mosques. The sources said the 
religious mission could have made political achievements had the 
Saudis responded favorably. 
  Information available to SHIHAN suggests Riyadh still 
rejects 
full normalization with Jordan. The reason is not an incorrect 
interpretation of Jordan's stand toward the Gulf crisis. 
Rather, it is the wrong interpretation of Jordan's role in 
bringing the views of the Yemeni parties closer and reconciling 
them in Amman in line with the accord document. Information 
also indicates that Jordan has refused over the past three years 
to make a public apology to Saudi Arabia because of its 
conviction that its stand toward the Gulf crisis and Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait was not biased toward Iraq, inasmuch as it 
was championing an Arab solution. 
  Jordanian government sources told SHIHAN that Jordan did not 
at all ask for U.S. intervention to mediate with Riyadh. Jordan 
believes the natural framework to address the misunderstanding 
resulting from the Gulf crisis is an Arab framework, be it 
bilateral or trilateral. It is within this framework that an 
open and frank dialogue can take place to reach genuine 
reconciliation. 
  An official thinks Saudi Arabia agreed to normalize 
relations 
with the PLO in response to a U.S. desire to strengthen the 
PLO's political and financial status in the wake of the Oslo 
accord. Saudi Arabia also agreed to normalize relations with the 
Yemeni Socialist Party -- Riyadh's archenemy before the Gulf 
crisis -- to take advantage of the dispute between President 
Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid and to serve Saudi 
interests, which were completely neglected after the achievement 
of political unity in 1990. 
  A Western diplomat in Amman thinks King Husayn's performance 
of the minor pilgrimage, without it being crowned by an official 
meeting with King Fahd -- not even a courteous meeting to show 
good hospitality -- is a clear indication that normalizing 
relations between the two sides is still far off and requires 
major political efforts by several Arab and regional, and 
perhaps international, parties. The special circumstances that 
opened the Saudi gate to the Yemeni Socialist Party and the PLO 
are still not available for Jordan, which the Saudi regime 
regards as a regional peer on all levels. 
  This diplomat thinks, however, that King Husayn's pilgrimage 
trip has exonerated Jordan from any obligations that could be 
necessary to normalize relations with Riyadh, which is now asked 
to respond positively to this overture, one way or another.

  [Text] Contrary to the expectations that had spread in the 
Jordanian capital, King Husayn left Saudi Arabia without being 
received by the custodian of the two holy mosques. 
  Jordanian sources had said that while in Saudi Arabia, the 
king would hold talks on the Gulf situation, clearing the Arab 
atmosphere, and peace efforts. 
  AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM has learned from its special sources that 
the 
idea of the Jordanian king's visit to Saudi Arabia had been 
proposed by Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Saudi 
Arabia during his meeting with the custodian of the two holy 
mosques, who welcomed the accord document signed in Amman. The 
sources said that al-Bid telephoned King Husayn in the presence 
of the custodian of the two holy mosques, who welcomed the 
king's visit for minor pilgrimage.

  [Text] The U.S. Administration has demanded that Jordan 
produce documents approving the export of 6,000 tonnes of 
chemical materials transported to Iraq in late 1993. The 
chemicals are used in the refinement of oil used by Jordan. 
  The Jordanian Government has submitted a report showing the 
kind of materials exported, the license plate numbers of trucks 
that transported them, and the dates of export. 
  The U.S. measure is meant to increase pressure on Jordan by 
propagating rumors that Jordan is not complying with the embargo 
against Iraq. The purpose is to force the Jordanian Government 
to conclude a treaty with Israel before discussing its details. 
  Observers note that the United States wants to give the 
world 
the impression that Jordan is smuggling on the official level. 
  Knowledgeable sources say Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali might sacrifice Finance Minister Sami Qammuh -- since 
Qammuh was the one who issued the export approvals -- in a bid 
to convince the United States that Qammuh acted on his own 
without consulting the government.

  [Text] The countdown to lift, or at least to alleviate the 
blockade that has been imposed on Iraq since the Gulf crisis, 
has begun. Many conflicting interests have emerged over the 
years of the blockade. After Iraq, Jordan has been harmed the 
most. It has been subjected to pressure and accused of 
violating the blockade and international resolutions. However, 
it has maintained its national line, and at the same time, tried 
to end the heavy international embargo on the sisterly Iraq. 
Jordan has contacted Washington in this regard, the prime 
minister paid a visit to the UN Headquarters, and officials have 
held talks on this subject with the U.S. secretary of commerce 
in Amman. Jordan's attempts have not stopped. 
  However, some clouds have been noticed recently in 
Jordanian-Iraqi relations. What are the reasons and what is the 
nature behind this? 
  Informed sources told us that the United States has begun to 
pave the road to Baghdad for its companies via Jordan and that 
contacts have been held between Washington and Amman to this 
effect. The sources added that the Americans are playing the 
card of besieging al-'Aqabah to obtain exceptional privileges 
for their companies at the expense of Jordanian companies. 
This, the sources added, is rejected by the Jordanian side. 
  Our sources added that the Iraqi side felt that special 
arrangements are under way through which the Americans are 
pressuring Jordan. Therefore, the sources said, the Iraqi side 
fabricated a trade crisis with the Jordanian Government to 
incorporate it in these arrangements instead of forcing it to 
submit to their results. This Iraqi stand was explained by a 
senior Iraqi official who met two weeks ago with a Jordanian 
party delegation. Our sources said that the Iraqis asked the 
Jordanian side to inform them of any Jordanian arrangements 
regarding trade with Iraq through official correspondence over 
the past two months. This was followed by Iraqi measures such 
as returning large quantities of Jordanian commodities because 
they did not, according to the Iraqis, completely meet their 
specifications. 
  Meanwhile, Iraqi decisionmakers in the economic field talked 
with their counterparts in the Jordanian private sector about 
pressures exerted by big Iraqi businessmen on their government 
to anticipate any surprises that might face them in the future 
because Jordan is the most important trade route to the Iraqis. 
  This picture, which was drawn by our sources, will certainly 
be changed by regional and international factors in the near 
future.

  [Text] Afghan President Rabbani agreed today to a 15-day 
cease-fire, but it was not clear whether his main rivals would 
support the truce or carry on rocketing the battered capital. 
  Despite Rabbani's plea, most people expect more fighting. 
Countless cease-fire agreements have collapsed and the current 
fighting is perhaps the most intense since the ousting of the 
communist government in 1992. 
  The latest cease-fire plan has been negotiated by military 
and political leaders from southwestern Afghanistan who recently 
arrived in Kabul. Since the fighting started 1 January, at 
least 1,000 people have been killed, more than 12,000 have been 
wounded, and some 600,000 have been driven from their homes.

  [Text] An abortive attack by the infamous militia of 
Karmal-Dostam-Hekmatyar, which was launched last night from the 
direction of Qabelbay and Yakatut [east of Kabul] on positions 
of the Islamic Army, has been repulsed. A responsible source of 
the General Command of Kabul Garrison reported to a BAKHTAR 
INFORMATION AGENCY military correspondent that last night's 
attack of the infamous militia of Golboddin and Dostam, who have 
been disappointed by their continued defeats, met -- as on 
previous occasions -- with strong resistance of mojahedin and 
the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The raiders were forced to 
retreat. As a result of this abortive attack a number of the 
infamous militia were either killed or injured, and a quantity 
of their ammunition such as 82mm artillery shells, mortar 
shells, and rockets have been taken as booty. 
  In retaliation for the failure of their assault, the 
infamous 
militia again targeted residential areas. Five residences were 
destroyed as a a result of the firing of ten rockets by them. 
No loss of life was reported from the rocket attack.

  [Excerpt] Last night and today, the Golboddin-Dostum 
militia martyred a number of our innocent compatriots by firing 
lethal rockets into the residential areas of Kabul. A BAKHTAR 
military correspondent reports that as a result of this rocket 
attack by the militia, a number of our compatriots were also 
injured and were taken to hospitals for treatment. 
  Similarly, as a result of rocket attacks and the firing of 
mortar shells into residential areas, which continued during 
today, much damage has been inflicted on public utility 
institutions, on residents, and public property. 
  In response to the savage rocket attacks by the militia, the 
Islamic Afghan Army's artillery delivered crushing blows on the 
bases of the enenmy in Maranjan hill and Bala-Hesar. As a 
result a number of the militia were killed and a number of their 
positions were destroyed. The savage rocket attack by the 
Golboddin-Dostum militia has no justification but their defeat.

  [Text] New Delhi has expressed the hope that Pakistan will 
now return to bilateral talks with India on the Kashmir issue 
following its setback in Geneva. The minister of state for 
external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, told a press conference 
in New Delhi today that India had a clear margin to defeat 
Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir if it had been put to vote. 
Mr. Khurshid, who returned from Geneva last night, said that 
there was overwhelming opinion that the bilateral issue should 
not be raised at Human Rights Commission forum. He denied 
entering into any tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable 
withdrawal of the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. Mr. Khurshid 
also ruled out any fact-finding commission of the Islamic 
conference Organization to Kashmir. He, however, disclosed that 
India has invited the permanent representatives of the ICO at 
Geneva to visit New Delhi for discussions.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Udhay Bhaskar] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister's observation to visiting U.S. 
senators that India will have to review and modify its defense 
policy if the United States resumes military aid to Pakistan by 
waiving the Pressler Amendment is both timely and perceptive. 
The implications and inferences of this one-time waiver of the 
Pressler Amendment are many. The waiver, reported to be urged 
by some sections of the Clinton Administration, and this 
demonstration of sympathy for Pakistan is fraught with 
far-reaching implications for the stability and security of the 
Indian subcontinent. 
  According to one estimate, a waiver now would result in 
Pakistan acquiring modern weapons and surveillance platforms 
almost immediately. The more notable include the F-16 fighter 
aircraft and the P-3C Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft. 
The Pakistani Air Force already has about 35 F-16's in its 
inventory, and if the Pressler Amendment was to be waived, the 
strength of the F-16's would go up three-fold. In like fashion, 
the induction of the versatile Orion, which is Harpoon-capable, 
will be extremely destabilizing from India's perspective. In 
short, Pakistan will be able to receive modern lethal weapons 
for all its three armed forces by a way of high-tech helicopter 
gunships, fighter and reconnaissance aircraft, and guided 
missile frigates. 
  The impact such an induction would have on Indian defense 
policy and plans needs little reiteration, more so when the 
recent Indian budget revealed that this year's defense 
allocation has actually declined by about 10 crore rupees in 
real term since last year. But more than the conventional 
weaponry and hardware, what could be rather disturbing if the 
waiver is pushed through is the interference and impact on the 
nuclear question and the sponsorship of terrorism. The United 
States would in effect be endorsing Pakistan's clandestine 
nuclear weapon program, and India apart, the impact in the rest 
of the region -- including Iran and Central Asia -- would be 
significant. Secondly, the United States either deliberately or 
unwittingly may be turning a blind eye to Pakistan's active role 
in state-sponsored terrorism -- a fact that was clearly brought 
to the attention of the global community in the recent 
deliberations in Geneva. The last but far from the least 
important inference would be the nature of the U.S.-Pakistan 
relationship in the post-Cold War period. 
  In according this one-time waiver, which Senator Larry 
Pressler had been constrained to unequivocally caution against, 
the Clinton Administration may be signalling a specific 
military-security role for Pakistan in the larger U.S. gameplan. 
Such a development, were it to fructify, would indeed have an 
impact on the political-military contours of the entire region.

<F P=106> [Article by Jagmohan: "Independent Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] Of late, there have been a few significant 
developments which indicate that the US is adopting a new 
posture towards India, particularly in relation to the Kashmir 
issue. 
  President Clinton, in his speech to the U.N. General 
Assembly 
on September 27. 1993, said: "Bloody ethnic, religious and civil 
wars were raging from Angola to Caucasus to Kashmir." On October 
29, 1993, Robin Raphel, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, at a 
"background briefing' for the South Asian journalists, observed: 
"We do not recognise the instrument of accession as meaning that 
Kashmir is for ever an integral part of India....The people of 
Kashmir have got to be consulted in any kind of final settlement 
of the Kashmir dispute." A clarification, subsequently issued by 
the State Department, confirmed what was stated by Raphel. It 
did not change the content of the dish but merely the manner of 
serving it. 
  On December 27, 1993, President Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi 
Fai, 'Executive Director', Kashmiri-American Council, saying 
that he shared the latter's concern for human rights and looked 
forward to working with him to help bring peace in Kashmir. In 
reply to a letter from Congressmen Gary Condit and 15 others, 
President Clinton observed: "I am aware of the chronic tensions 
between the lndian Government and the Sikh militants, and share 
your desire for a peaceful solution that protects Sikh rights." 
  All these statements and letters, issued in a short span of 
about four months, clearly point to the direction in which the 
wind is blowing. President Clinton's address to the U.N. 
Assembly where he virtually equated Kashmir situation with that 
prevailing in former Yugoslavia and Somalia; his warm response 
to Fai, a self-styled interlocutor whose activities are funded 
by Pakistan, and who is fuelling terrorism in the Kashmir 
Valley; his reference to Sikh rights as if Sikhs are not like 
other Indian citizens; and Raphel's highly provocative 
observations, questioning even the validity of the Instrument of 
Accession, are all manifestations of U.S. increasing disposition 
to ignore Indian sensitivities, lean towards Pakistan and 
indicate, in the process, a subtle preference for independent or 
semi-independent Kashmir. 
  There are other straws in the wind which point in the same 
direction. On September 27-28, 1993, the Kashmir Bar Association 
organised a "Lawyers Meet" at which a series of resolutions were 
passed. One resolution (No. 5) says that the people should be 
given 'an option not to accede to either of the two countries, 
India or Pakistan'. Reading between the lines, it is evident 
that public opinion is being created to secure modification of 
the U.N. resolutions and provide for the 'third option' -- 
independent Kashmir. Efforts of this nature, there are 
reasonable grounds to believe, are being surreptitiously 
encouraged by U.S. policy-makers. 
  For the last two years, the U.S. Institute of Peace, 
Washington, a 'think tank' funded by U.S. Congress, has been 
showing inordinate interest in Kashmir affairs. In continuation 
of the January 1993 meeting, another meeting was organised by 
the Institute in January 1994 and 15 non-officials from India, 
Pakistan and `both parts of Kashmir', who are believed by the 
Institute to exercise influence over public opinion were 
invited. The `framework' papers and pattern-of discussions, 
albeit informal, seem to suggest that the `position, of 
Kashmiris as central actors' need to be given a `top slot'. The 
intention was clear. It was to prepare a background for a change 
in the thinking of both India and Pakistan. One of the Indian 
participants, in an article written after the Washington 
meeting, argued: "How long can India be indifferent to the 
status damage it suffers as a result of the continuing 
blood-letting in Kashmir?". 
  Earlier, some academicians like Prof Cohen who have a 
substantial say in the formation of American policy on South 
Asia had begun arguing that "the road to accession to 
Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] runs through Kashmir", implying 
thereby that India's current difficulties with regard to the 
Valley could be used to pressurise it to sign the NPT. 
  Taking an overall view of the situation and long-term 
interests of the US in the region, its policy-makers seem to be 
seriously thinking that it would be best to have an independent 
or semi-independent Kashmir. Such a state could serve as an 
effective instrument for putting pressure on China, if the need 
for doing so arises in future. It could also help in acquiring a 
stronger foothold in five Central Asian Republics and 
manipulating events in Russia to prevent an unfriendly 
power-structure emerging there once again. Pakistan could become 
a client state to a greater degree and India's arm twisted more 
forcefully to sign the NPT. 
  The United States is seeing new opportunities for itself in 
the troubled waters of Kashmir and it is moving, albeit 
unobtrusively, to seize these. Its basic objective is to remain 
as the only superpower in the world. President Clinton, in his 
address to the U.N. General Assembly, made it clear: "The United 
States intended to remain engaged and to lead". An influential 
section of American academics have also been arguing that the 
"bear may be dead but snakes and scorpions still roam". 
  If India encourages U.S. moves on Kashmir with a determined 
stand and by mobilising strong opinion in its favour, the U.S. 
could well abandon or modify the course it has presently taken. 
After all, Washington cannot afford to incur the hostility of a 
nation of 880 million people. In this connection, it is worth 
recalling that when the die-hard Tory members of the British 
Parliament, like R. A. Butler and Winston Churchill tried to 
browbeat India by espousing the cause of the Nizam of Hyderabad, 
the `faithful ally of the empire', Sardar Patel firmly told them 
not to stand by the `old world' . He made it clear: "It is only 
in goodwill spirit, and not on the malice and venom of Mr 
Churchill's tongue, that an enduring relationship of friendship 
can be built between India and Britain and other members of the 
Commonwealth." He thus successfully prevented Hyderabad, which 
he described as an 'ulcer in the abdomen of India', from 
becoming cancerous. Such a forthright and fearless stand towards 
Washington's new posture, I am sure, would help India in 
retrieving the situation, besides sending the right signals to 
the secessionists in the Valley. 
  Unfortunately, India is taking a characteristically meek 
stand. When President Clinton wrote to Fai, virtually ignoring 
the savagery of terrorism in Kashmir, I wish someone from our 
foreign office had invited his attention to what Senator Jackson 
said when the safety of American citizens was itself under 
terrorist threat. Jackson observed: "The idea that one person's 
terrorist is another's freedom fighter cannot be sanctioned. 
Freedom fighters or revolutionaries do not blow up buses 
containing non-combatants; terrorist murderers do. Freedom 
fighters do not assassinate innocent businessmen or hijack and 
hold hostage innocent men, women and children; terrorist 
murderers do. It is a disgrace that democracies should allow the 
treasured word 'freedom' to be associated with acts of 
terrorists."

  [Text] Kuwait City, March 12 (AFP) -- The Kuwaiti 
ambassador to Qatar is to return to his post after having been 
recalled recently amid strengthening ties between Qatar and 
Iraq, a Sunday paper reported here. 
  The daily AL-QABAS said in its Sunday edition that Muhammad 
al-Rumi would return to Doha after celebrations for the end of 
Ramadan, the Moslem month of fasting. 
  The paper said, quoting the Kuwaiti foreign ministry, that 
al-Rumi had been recalled for talks after television reports in 
Doha on the situation in Iraq and the impact of a UN-imposed 
embargo. 
  Kuwait recalled al-Rumi in mid-February and protested to the 
Qatar government for allowing the official television to give 
airtime to Iraqi leaders. 
  Apart from Oman, which never broke off links with Iraq, 
Qatar 
is the only member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to have 
renewed ties with Baghdad since its invasion of Kuwait in August 
1990 which sparked the Gulf war.

  [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, and His Highness 
Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president of the United 
Arab Emirates [UAE], have held a closed session at al-Musharraf 
Palace in Abu Dhabi. 
  The Yemeni News Agency, SABA, has learned that the two 
presidents discussed issues and developments of interest to the 
relations between the two brotherly countries and ways of 
enhancing them. They also discussed developments in the Arab 
arena and the efforts of the two fraternal countries to restore 
Arab solidarity. 
  During the meeting, the brother president briefed his 
brother, His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, on developments 
in Yemen in light of the signing of the accord document and the 
efforts under way to contain the political crisis in our 
country. He also briefed him on the successes by the joint 
military committee in stopping the regrettable military 
developments. He further expressed his appreciation for the 
brothers, including the brothers in the UAE, for their support 
for our people ini overcoming the challenges imposed by the 
political crisis and their support for Yemeni unity. 
  Brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih arrived in Abu Dhabi 
at 
2100 Sanaa local time today leading a high-level delegation on a 
brotherly visit to the fraternal UAE. He is to meet with his 
brother, His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, 
president of the UAE, for talks on fraternal relations and ways 
of enhancing them. They will also discuss developments in the 
regional, Arab, and international arenas, as well as issues of 
interest to our Arab nation, primarily ways to clear the Arab 
atmosphere and restore Arab solidarity, and issues of common 
interest. The brother president will also brief his brother, 
His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, on the developments in our 
country and the efforts being made to contain the current 
political crisis and implement the accord document. The purpose 
of this is to end the crisis, safeguard unity and democracy, and 
bolster stability in our country. 
  His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president 
of the UAE, led those who received the brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council at Abu Dhabi Airport. He gave the brother 
chairman a warm brotherly hug and welcomed him. [passage 
omitted] 
  Upon arrival at Abu Dhabi Airport, the brother chairman of 
the Presidential Council made a statement to the UAE mass media. 
He said: Our visit to the sisterly UAE tonight gives me 
personally an opportunity to meet with dear brother His Highness 
Shakyh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al-Nuhayyan, the UAE president, and to 
hold consultations with him on all that is related to the 
intimate relations between the two sisterly countries. These 
distinguished relations are testified to by the projects that 
have been carried out by the UAE in Yemen, projects that prove 
the deep relations of amity among the peoples of the Arabian 
Peninsula and the Gulf. Our Yemeni people will always highly 
appreciate the stand of Shaykh Zayid and the sons of his 
generous people in the UAE and their contribution to our 
development process and support for the unity of Yemen. [words 
indistinct] a living example of the deep sisterly relations 
between the two peoples. During the visit, I will brief my 
honorable brother, Shaykh Zayid, on the developments of the 
situation in our country in light of the signing of the pledge 
and accord document and the efforts being exerted to begin 
implementing it on the basis of reviving the Constitutional and 
executive institutions and cooperation among all parties to the 
government coalition -- the General Peoples's Congress, the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. This 
will ensure putting an end to the political crisis, containing 
its regrettable repercussions, consolidating unity, and 
maintaining the democratic experience in our country. In this 
regard, we cannot do without the efforts and role of the 
brothers in the UAE, led by His Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, who has 
taken honorable pan-Arab stands in support of Yemeni unity, 
which is a pan-Arab gain for the Arab nation and a significant 
factor for bolstering regional security, stability, and peace. 
We are also looking forward to a greater UAE role at the 
current stage in view of the his Highness Shaykh Zayid's special 
status in the hearts of the sons of Yemen and for his known 
wisdom and pan-Arab concern to serve the Arab nation's 
objectives and supreme interests. Undoubtedly, our talks in the 
UAE will deal with ways of clearing the Arab atmosphere of all 
impurities that have stuck to it as a result of the regrettable 
Gulf crisis. We will also be discussing ways of restoring Arab 
solidarity, especially since His Highness Shaykh Zayid initiated 
the call for healing the rift, closing Arab ranks, and restoring 
Arab solidarity. We in the Republic of Yemen have supported 
this pan-Arab initiative. We will do our best along with our 
brothers to achieve this objective.

  [Text] Sanaa, March 12 (AFP) -- President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih Saturday urged the people of Yemen to oppose any attempt 
to divide the country, calling for talks to resolve its 
seven-month-old political crisis. 
  In a national address marking the end of the Moslem fasting 
month of Ramadan, he said: "We must not tolerate any attempts to 
break the country's unity or to provoke sedition or war." 
  North and South Yemen were unified in May 1990, but a crisis 
broke out in August when Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a 
southerner, refused to take up his duties in Sanaa, demanding 
major political and economic reforms. 
  Salih, a northerner, added: "Those who think Yemen's 
problems 
can be solved by dividing (the country) are wrong." 
  He called for talks to resolve all differences with al-Bid, 
his main political rival. 
  Tensions have been building in Yemen in recent weeks between 
rival north and south armies, despite a February 20 
reconciliation accord.

<F P=106> ["Text" of message from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on </F>
the eve of 'Id al-Fitr in Sanaa on 12 March; read by announcer 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] We had hoped that with the 
advent of 'Id al-Fitr our country would have emerged from the 
crisis and so redouble our joy over the signing of the accord 
document on 10 Ramadan in the Jordanian capital under the 
auspices of His Majesty King Husayn. However, we have not lost 
hope that the crisis will soon blow over so the state's 
constitutional institutions may again become active with the 
participation and cooperation of the partners in the coalition 
government to implement the document, ease the burden on the 
population, and build the modern Yemeni state on modern 
foundations that will ensure the sovereignty of law and order, 
enhance the role of institutions, nurture respect for 
constitutional legitimacy, respect the will of the people, and 
be bound by the principle of a peaceful and democratic rotation 
of power. 
  In this effort, we must emphasize our commitment to 
inviolable and sacred national parameters, notably unity and 
democracy. Unity is the source of the people's strength and is 
a guarantee for stability, advancement, and national prosperity. 
  On this occaion, we renew the call for all disagreements, 
contradictions, and problems to be ironed out through the 
channels of democratic, objective, and sober dialogue, and 
reason and wisdom. The homeland is not the exclusive property of 
any one individual, party, or group. Nor has anyone the right 
to claim custodianship over unity, the people, or any part of 
the homeland. Unity is our people's communal property. We will 
not squander our unity no matter what the price. He is in 
error who thinks that the solutions to problems lay in 
undermining unity or taking the homeland back to the era 
preceding 22 May, 1990. The wheels of history have moved forward 
and will not turn backward. The solution lay in rectifying 
behavior and mistakes and taking a determined stand against all 
kinds of corruption and the embezzlement of public money, the 
due process of law, accountability, putting the general good of 
the homeland before narrow or party interests, dissociation from 
parochial affiliations, and desisting from stoking regional, 
tribal, and other tendencies. The yardstick by which faith in 
the unity of the homeland must be measured is action to advance 
the unity of the people. This is because no homeland cannot 
remain united unless its citizens share a common will and unless 
their loyalty to their respective parties or regions takes 
second place to their loyalty to their homeland. The homeland 
is a trust that we must keep; the protection of unity is a 
sacred national duty. None of us should take lightly any 
attempt to tear up our country's unity or plunge it into 
sedition or war. It is an unforgivable crime for a Yemeni to 
kill his Yemeni brother or for Yemeni blood to be shed by Yemeni 
hands. Therefore, it is every Yemeni patriot's sacred duty to 
speak up against whatever may heighten tension or trigger armed 
conflict. 
  Brother Citizens: My visit to Egypt and the United Arab 
Emirates during the last week of the holy month of Ramadan was 
an opportunity for me to meet with brother President Muhammad 
Husni Mubarak and His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al 
Nuhayyan, president of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]. The 
talks I had there were positive and useful both for our 
bilateral ties and for joint pan-Arab action. The two brotherly 
countries emphasized their full support for Yemen's unity and 
deep concern for its security. We deeply appreciate Egypt and 
the UAE and other Arab brothers for their brotherly stands and 
the way they relate to our country's concerns. 
  In the name of all our people, on this happy occasion, I 
send my greetings to all our Armed and Security Forces 
personnel, who have consistently proved up to the sacred 
national responsibility, which they are shouldering with 
courage, devotion, and patience. They shall always watch over 
our unity, freedom, and democracy and faithfully stand guard 
over our national sovereignty and all the gains scored by the 
people. To the best of their ability, they shall distance 
themselves from all political differences and disputes. This is 
because by staying loyal to God, the homeland, the revolution, 
and unity, they thus remain above all partisan differences and 
disputes. 
  I repeat my congratulations on the 'Id. God's peace and 
mercy be upon you.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Mar (MENA)--'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council and leader of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, has warned that an anti-Arab scheme is 
being planned to spread terrorism and extremism with a view to 
harming the ambitions of the Arab and Islamic nation and 
isolating it from the rest of the world. 
  In a statement to AL-AHRAM published today, al-Bid says that 
the features of this terrorist scheme are clear to all, and its 
threat extends to a number of Arab countries. 
  He called for confronting the scheme by bringing it up for 
discussion at the pan-Arab level. He said the backward 
mentalities that want to impose their control on the Arab and 
Islamic nation must be confronted. 
  Al-Bid welcomed any Arab effort to steer unified Yemen clear 
of the specter of civil war and help the country to continue its 
democratic and peaceful march and adhere to the Pledge and 
Accord Document on national reconciliation. 
  He praised the efforts of Egypt and President Husni Mubarak 
to contain the Yemeni crisis. He said Egypt, by virtue of its 
relations with and assistance to Yemen, can play an effective 
role on the Yemeni scene. 
  On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said: From experience, we 
have come to realize that Yemen had neither the right 
circumstances nor the suitable leadership for unity of action in 
the past. 
  Some believed the signing of the Pledge and Accord Document 
ended the crisis, but this is wrong; the signing meant only that 
we acknowledged the crisis and laid down the bases to resolve 
it, he said. 
  "The situation requires that we move toward implementation 
in 
the appropriate circumstances," he added. 
  On fears that a military confrontation may break out in 
Yemen, al-Bid said there are such fears, and the Military 
Committee needs help from Arab forces -- especially Egypt, which 
is the closest Arab country to us -- so that a civil war can be 
avoided.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--Yemeni Prime Minister Engineer 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has announced that he will address a 
final invitation to the cabinet to meet in Aden after the 'Id 
al-Fitr holiday to discuss ways to implement the Pledge and 
Accord Document that was signed in Jordan and has not been 
implemented yet. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM's Saturday edition, he said an 
invitation will also be sent to the National Dialogue Committee 
to meet in Aden after the 'Id al-Fitr holiday to continue the 
dialogue, which stopped after a number of its participants 
withdrew because of escalating squabbles, the mass media's 
stand, and military clashes between the armed forces of the 
General People's Congress in Sanaa and the Socialist Party's 
forces in the border governorates in Abyan, Abb, (Ta'izz), and 
Lahij. 
  He expressed hopes that the crisis will be resolved and 
noted 
the need for all the parties to cooperate to achieve this end. 
  Al-'Attas emphasized that terrorism has serious effects on 
Yemen and on the Arab countries to which this terrorism is 
exported. He said he does not approve of any terrorist act 
directed from his country at fraternal Egypt or other Arab 
countries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni </F>
Presidential Council and assistant secretary general of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party, by unidentified AL-WASAT reporter 
"during his stopover in Abu Dhabi;" date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How do you interpret the clashes and 
security incidents that occurred immediately after the signing 
of the Accord and Pledge Document? Does it mean that a major 
defect is still there? 
  [Muhammad] First, I would like to briefly explain that the 
conflict in Yemen has not ended. It is common knowledge that 
this conflict is taking place between two major orientations. 
The first is leading a drive for modernization, building the 
institutions and the state of law and order, and creating a 
system of domestic and foreign relations. The basis of this 
orientation is the emerging democracy and its ideas. Democracy 
has become one of the phenomena of the age. The first 
orientation aspires for change, leaving the 20th century and 
entering the next century, and creating new circumstances for 
the coming generations. The second orientation is the 
conservative orientation, represented by the General People's 
Congress, the Reform Grouping, and their allies. Those 
supporting this orientation are ready to do anything to maintain 
the current situation and the existing system. In sum, they 
want to return Yemen to the situation which existed in the 
former Yemeni Arab Republic. Hence, this orientation views 
changes and evolution with fear and caution. They fear that 
they might lose certain interests, which they grabbed after they 
controlled the existing institutions, especially the tribal and 
military institutions. Therefore, they do not want to permit 
the emergence of civilian institutions in accordance with a 
modern democratic system. 
  [Reporter] What has made matters often escalate to a 
military 
confrontation, and sometimes to security disorder? 
  [Muhammad] There has been systematic and premeditated 
terrorism. Terrorist operations have been pre-arranged. 
Assassinations, explosions, highway robberies, lootings, rapes, 
and other forms of terrorism occurred. Moreover, these 
operations took a serious turn and began to include domestic and 
foreign investments. Besides, foreign experts have been 
kidnapped and companies, especially oil companies, have been 
threatened. Tourists and foreign embassies have been 
threatened. The main objective is to destroy the unity process, 
abort democracy, and hinder any attempt for change. This is in 
order to maintain their control of the country and to bring 
everybody under their authority. 
  [Reporter] Do you believe that a final solution has been 
provided by the signing of the document, or is the country and 
its unity still in danger? 
  [Muhammad] Let us be frank, certain parties inside the 
General People's Congress and the Reform Grouping are not 
satisfied with the document. Their signing of it does not mean 
that everything will proceed well. Some influential parties 
reject the contents of the document. This explains the 
continued military confrontations and military incidents. Those 
parties will continue their attempts to exacerbate the security 
situation and create problems in order to keep people 
preoccupied, evade implementation of the document, and, at the 
same time, put the blame on us. This is evidenced by the fact 
that the other party has no desire or intention to take to 
justice those pepole involved in cases of assassinations and 
explosions, they have no intention of making reforms, and they 
continue military provocations. 
  [Reporter] Some say that al-Bid's failure to come to Sanaa 
gives the other side a justification for not implementing the 
document? 
  [Muhammad] I want to ask: Who guarantees al-Bid's life if he 
goes to Sanaa? Who can go to Sanaa when he feels that his head 
is wanted? We say that they must implement all items of the 
document before al-Bid goes to Sanaa. The guarantee is 
implementation of all clauses of the document, especially since 
we are still witnessing assassinations, houses and offices being 
blown up, and other practices which cannot be approved by any 
norms or laws whatsoever. 
  [Reporter] Do you deem the signed agreement an absolute 
guarantee for maintaining unity and removing the threat of 
separation? What are the external effects on the situation in 
Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] The agreement is not a medical prescription. 
Having it signed does not mean that it has become the only 
guarantee for maintaining unity. The threat of separation is 
still there. Although the agreement has been signed, nothing has 
changed yet. This agreement provides guidelines and programs 
which need political will to be implemented. They also require 
balanced internal and external support. This is what we are 
trying to do through our recent and current tours. We want a 
presence by our brothers in Arab Gulf states. This covers, for 
example, neighboring states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, as 
well as the Gulf Cooperation Council states. Eritrea, Egypt, 
Syria, and then the Arab League and the world, such as the 
United States, some European countries, and even Russia are also 
needed. These countries can help Yemen's peaceful unity 
process. This is because we have common interests. Besides, we 
must reassure our neighbors that our unity does not threaten 
them if it is based on reason, good-neighborliness, good 
relations, and cooperation. Why should our relations with our 
neighbors not be excellent? It is not in our interest to be 
anyone's enemy. This is what we believe in and work to see 
happen. Hence our tours.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Loss of Face in Geneva"] </F>
  [Text] We have done it again. The much publicised 
initiative to seek international censure of human rights abuses 
in the Indian held Kashmir has been for the second time in quick 
succession held back at the eleventh hour. First it was the 
Indian offer of talks on Kashmir, and now the intervention of 16 
countries, including our close allies Iran and China that has 
apparently deterred Islamabad from going whole hog in pursuit of 
its number one agenda in foreign relations. Ironically, the 
prime minister had only a few days ago asserted in categorical 
terms that come what may, Pakistan will go ahead with its 
campaign for international recognition of the Kashmir cause, and 
the 'game of numbers' will not stand in its way. Whether it was 
an outright foreign policy debacle, as the Opposition would 
insist or a tactical retreat dictated by the compulsion of 
circumstances, as is likely to be offered as an alibi by the 
Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the least, has been guilty of 
gross miscalculation in Geneva. And the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs should be made accountable for misleading the government 
and the people about the success of our campaign to win 
international support. No matter what diplomatic jargon has 
been used to describe our unceremonious retreat, we have, for 
all practical purposes, withdrawn our resolution from the Human 
Rights Commission. And whether we like it or not New Delhi has 
scored a major propaganda victory. Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad 
Ali's contention that the objective to highlight Kashmir has 
been achieved and 'it has been a great victory for Pakistan 
since the resolution remains alive' simply does not hold and is 
certainly not good enough to explain away the failure of our 
initiatives on Kashmir. Perhaps it is time to review the entire 
gamut of our Kashmir strategy and withhold any fresh moves until 
we have undertaken a thorough stocktaking of our track record. 
It is of utmost importance that we should have the insight to 
discern where we had gone wrong in our understanding of world 
politics, and whether it was our lack of comprehension, or 
misplaced optimism on the righteousness of our cause. Is accent 
on human rights abuses a viable strategy to draw world attention 
to the Kashmir cause? 
  If the Americans have chosen to project themselves as the 
custodians of human rights, it does not mean that they are no 
longer selective in their concern for human rights abuses, and 
are ready for an even-handed approach to deal with all victims 
of repression. So is the case with their European allies who 
couldn't care less for rape, torture and mass killings let loose 
on Bosnian Muslims. We have to sooner than later clearly 
identify our `constituency' in the international arena and 
design our moves to cater for their sensibilities. The third 
world countries do not in any case have an enviable human rights 
record, whether it is China or Iran or the vast majority of OIC 
countries. Human rights is not the kind of issue on which 
Pakistan can hope to muster support for the Kashmir cause, 
particularly when the US is trying to browbeat them on this 
score. In the wake of the embarrassment we have suffered and 
the despondency it may cause among the Kashmiri 
freedom-fighters, it would be in the fitness of things to weigh 
our gains and losses in foreign policy. Had we gone through 
with the vote would we be closer to our goal today? Would the 
world have rallied to our call of liberation of Kashmir, or 
would it have turned its back on us, as it seems to have done 
now?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Decision To Defer the Resolution"] </F>
  [Text] The resolution tabled by Pakistan at the UN Human 
Rights Commission to condemn the Indian atrocities in Kashmir 
has been deferred for one year. Such a decision would have to 
have been made in the wake of certain mediatory efforts of 
friendly countries -- Iran and China. Iran has assured the 
Pakistani authorities that it will continue to work to help stop 
human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Apart from this, 
India has also agreed to allow a delegation comprising 
representatives of Muslim countries to visit Kashmir to assess 
and observe the situation on the ground and the human rights 
condition there. 
  Pakistan's decision to defer the resolution by one year is 
certainly not an exemplary decision, because, in our opinion, 
the adoption of the resolution would have been the best thing. 
However, a situation had arisen at the Human Rights Commission, 
under which Pakistan had to yield to the pressures of Iran, 
China, and 15 other friendly countries. It had become clear 
many days ago that about 40 or more of the 53-member commission 
did not intend to vote on the resolution and hardly 10-12 
members could have agreed to vote. It was expected that some 
seven to eight members would vote in favor of the resolution. 
Hence, even though the resolution would have been adopted with 
a slight majority, it would not have exerted much moral 
influence and pressure and India could have refused to respect 
it. 
  Opinions may vary on the method now adopted by the friendly 
countries and it can be said that Pakistan should not have 
deferred the resolution under any circumstances. The chairman 
of the Kashmir Committee and several opposition leaders have 
stated the same thing. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had also 
said that the resolution was not a game of statistics but a 
matter of principle and even if we were left alone, we would not 
refrain from supporting the cause of the Kashmiris. The 
decision to defer the resolution, obviously, seems to be 
contrary to this commitment, but, if viewed closely, it would 
not be appropriate to jump to the above conclusion. Pakistan 
has once again declared its intention to continue to fight for 
the cause of the Kashmiris and the foreign minister has stated 
in no uncertain terms that Pakistan will raise its voice in 
support of the Kashmiris at all international forums. He has 
also said that our resolution will always hang like a sword over 
India's head and we will be able to present it again at the UN 
General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Commission session. 
Thus, to assume that by deferring the resolution Pakistan has 
withdrawn its support to the Kashmiris will be totally erroneous 
and incomprehensible logic. 
  The foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the 
resolution Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is 
correct to a great extent. This was not a mean achievement, as 
the BBC has said that after a gap of 29 years Pakistan has 
raised the Kashmir issue at every international forum. It is 
also true that during the debate on the resolution, the Kashmir 
dispute had become the focus of the world's attention. The 
member-countries, which had decided to abstain from the voting, 
also condemned India's action in occupied Kashmir. By tabling 
the resolution, Pakistan has also belied the Indian claim that 
the Kashmir dispute is a bilateral problem and that the Simla 
agreement does not empower Pakistan to raise the issue at any 
international forum. Pakistan has proved this stand as being 
completely wrong. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had to 
admit that most of the world nations were not paying heed to 
India's stand and were paying greater attention to what he 
called "irrelevant issues" like the human rights. The Indian 
leader also admitted that Pakistan appears to be a champion of 
human rights, while India is standing in the dock as a criminal 
in the court of international opinion. Narasimha Rao's 
confessions make it clear that Pakistan has achieved 
considerable success in projecting the Kashmir issue at the 
international level. 
  One of the main clauses of the formula, under which Pakistan 
has deferred its resolution, is that a delegation of the 
member-countries of the Islamic Conference Organization will be 
allowed to visit Kashmir. In addition, other agencies like the 
Amnesty International and Red Cross will also enjoy the right to 
send their delegations to Kashmir. Earlier, two major 
delegations have already toured occupied Kashmir and 10 
India-based foreign ambassadors are currently visiting the 
territory. That shows that India has been forced to open up 
Kashmir to international observers, which, in fact, was one of 
the major objectives of Pakistan. India has also promised to 
certain friendly countries to reduce its troops in occupied 
Kashmir and to improve the human rights situation there. 
However, India's past record has not been encouraging, as 
rightly suggested by Pakistani delegate Ahmad Kamal that 
whenever India comes under pressure, it makes certain promises, 
but when that pressure is removed, it deviates from its 
commitments. Nonetheless, it would not be that easy for India 
now to breach its promises because the entire world is keeping 
an eye on the situation in Kashmir. Therefore, to construe that 
Pakistan has deferred its resolution without achieving anything 
would be incorrect. The Kashmiris themselves and the Pakistanis 
have to wage a prolonged struggle to liberate the Kashmiris from 
Indian subjugation. One of the stages of this long struggle was 
to table the resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission. It 
has yielded some results and much success has been achieved in 
making the international public realize the importance of the 
Kashmir problem. This holy war and the struggle are still 
continuing and will continue in future. Pakistan will continue 
its efforts to help the 12.5 million Kashmiris achieve their 
right to self-determination. The tabling of the resolution was 
a kind of war on the Kashmir front, but the war is still 
continuing and we will certainly be crowned with success, and 
the Kashmiri people will finally emerge victorious.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Campaign Against the Pressler </F>
Amendment"] 
  [Text] A meeting held at the Prime Minister House the other 
day reviewed all important aspects of Pakistan-U.S. relations. 
It was attended by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto; Foreign 
Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali; Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. 
Khan; and Dr. Maliha Lodhi, Pakistani ambassador to the United 
States. The Pakistani ambassador gave details of her meetings 
with President Clinton and other U.S. authorities and said that 
she has been apprising the U.S. circles of Pakistan's position 
on the Pressler Amendment and expressed the hope that the warmth 
in relations between the two countries will be visible again. 
Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto expressed the confidence that 
Pakistan will be able to convince the United States that the 
Pressler Amendment is a discriminatory law and that it failed to 
serve the purpose of nuclear nonproliferation in the region. 
  The Pressler Amendment is applicable only to Pakistan. 
Consequently, the United States has suspended economic and 
military aid to Pakistan, thereby creating a very difficult 
situation for this country. Pakistan very courageously endured 
the situation and made it clear to the United States that as far 
as nuclear nonproliferation is concerned, Pakistan has never 
disagreed with it. However, it set only one condition: that 
India should sign the treaty first. 
  Pakistan presented a number of proposals on keeping South 
Asia a nuclear-free zone, but India has consistently rejected 
these proposals. The United States has started to realize that 
Pakistan is interested not in manufacturing the nuclear weapon 
but in nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This is why the 
Pakistani leadership is expressing the confidence that the 
United Stats will be convinced that the Pressler Amendment is a 
discriminatory law. 
  A report says that Senator Larry Pressler has stressed that 
before making any changes in the Pressler Amendment, it should 
be ensured that President Clinton verifys that Pakistan does not 
possess a nuclear weapon. Larry Pressler argues that if the 
United States shows leniency in its attitude toward nuclear 
nonproliferation, then the countries that have acquired nuclear 
capability, including North Korea, will be encouraged to carry 
out a nuclear explosion. Larry Pressler's opinion cannot be 
taken as the last word. The U.S. Administration should keep the 
facts in view and avoid creating difficulties for a friendly 
country only on the basis of speculations.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has described the massacre of 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron as the worst incident in the 
history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He noted that there had 
been massacres such as those of Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Sabra, 
and Shatila in the past, but there was no peace process then 
like the process that began in Madrid in October 1990, nor were 
there peace negotiations. 
  In an interview with the Egyptian weekly UKTUBAR to be 
published Sunday [13 March], he said that UN resolutions 
stipulate frankly that the settlements are illegal and that they 
form an obstacle to peace. He added that the settlements are 
not only an impediment to peace but they now pose a problem for 
Israel itself and that Israel now does not know what to do with 
the settlers. 
  He pointed out that protection of the Palestinians has 
become 
the issue of the hour and that a solution must be found to this 
before the peace process resumes. 
  He expressed hopes that the Arabs will get a permanent seat 
at the Security Council, but he remarked that there must be some 
contacts for this. 
  He said that the issue of voting on the Arab League 
resolutions will be discussed at the League Council's meeting 
due to be held at the foreign minister level at the end of this 
month. The (?charter) needs (?to be amended) so that 
resolutions can be passed by a majority of two-thirds instead of 
the current system which depends on [words indistinct]. 
  He added that he will ask the Arab countries at the next 
meeting to set up an Arab court of justice as stipulated in 
Article [word indistinct] of the Arab League Charter of 1945.

<F P=106> [By Zakariya Nil] </F>
  [Excerpts] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid has urged the Arab countries to let the Arab 
League start immediately to prepare to confront the challenges 
posed for them by the major economic blocs, foremost of which 
are the free trade agreement "GATT" and the so-called Middle 
East market. 
  He also called on the Arabs to set up an Arab Free Trade 
Area 
(AFTA) similar to the U.S.-Canadian-Mexican one (NAFTA), the 
other economic blocs (GATT), and the Asian bloc. 
  He stressed that peace is not a gift or a present given by 
Israel to the Arabs, but rather the opposite, adding that the 
Arab boycott of Israel will continue as long as the latter 
continues to occupy Arab territories. He noted that the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement has given more hope than contained 
in its clauses. 
  These remarks were made during Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid's dialogue 
at a seminar held by the al-Jizah Rotary Club with businessmen 
and intellectuals who are Rotarians. 
  In a reply to a question, the Arab League secretary general 
said: What we should focus on now is the global economic 
struggle going on around us. Globalism might be a source of 
hope for some, but it is a source of anxiety for others. 
Today's world is one of major economic blocs or groupings in 
which there is no place for individual countries. Our Arab 
world cannot live on the margin. [passage omitted] 
  In reply to another question, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The 
application of the GATT agreement's clauses will result in the 
liberalization of international trade in many commodities and 
services; it will lead to the elimination of subsidies for 
agricultural exports and for farmers and the elimination of the 
textiles agreement so that it will become part of GATT in 10 
years. This is in addition to all the other GATT clauses. 
  Responding to another question, the Arab League secretary 
general said: It is evident from the above that Arab 
agricultural products will suffer too much due to the high cost 
of Arab agricultural production when compared with imports from 
countries that enjoy a very high level of economic efficiency, 
particularly as the Arab countries import more than 60 percent 
of their food requirements. This is bound to affect the Arab 
countries' exports due to the factors of quality and 
competition. It is also bound to subject the Arab markets to an 
intensive invasion by competing products, especially when 
conditions for preventing commodity subsidies are imposed. The 
same will apply to the services trade and government purchases 
sectors. In return, the Arab countries will benefit from the 
liberalization of the building equipment, agricultural 
machinery, and medical equipment trade. 
  If we look at the list of countries that will annually 
benefit from GATT, we will notice that the European Union [EU] 
will be the first beneficiary, followed by North America, China, 
the Asian countries, and Japan. The last group to benefit from 
GATT will be the Gulf countries (their share of international 
trade will be $3.1 billion compared to the $80.7 billion that 
the EU will attain). 
  Thus, this agreement imposes on us as many challenges as 
benefits. This requires us to start preparing for it starting 
right now throughout the years of grace, some lasting up to 10 
years, allowed by GATT to the developing countries so that they 
can reorganize their economic infrastructures in line with the 
requirements of the new phase of global economy. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say: I personally heard about 
the so-called Middle East market in 1988 from a senior Israeli 
official, who added to it a new Marshall plan for the Middle 
East where Israel would be one of the principal links. The call 
for this market intensified following the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles on 13 September 
1993. The region is being prepared for the post-peace-talks era 
and the envisioned future; and the future relations between its 
countries are being prepared for. We are facing a new epoch in 
the history of the region that requires a radical and 
comprehensive change in line with efforts for achieving a 
comprehensive and just settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
In this context, Israel is aiming to establish the so-called 
Middle East market and this makes us ask: Where do we stand in 
all this? How do we prepare for dealing with it? 
  Israel's objectives depend on Arab acceptance, because 
Israel cannot impose its objectives on the Arab world regardless 
of the form this market takes. If such a market is set up, our 
dealings with it will proceed from certain facts, which I 
summarize as the following: 
  -- The Arabs are a huge force with a variety of resources 
and 
potentials. They are widespread and have many 
markets--something that guarantees their ability to set up a 
huge economic grouping capable of securing the unity of the Arab 
region and preserving its identity, apart from its ability to 
affect things rather than be affected. 
  -- There is nothing that frightens this huge force, because 
Israel is no more than a small area restricted by limited 
resources in the midst of a vast Arab ocean that has great 
potentials and resources. Israel will not have any distinctive 
economic advantage, but one can deal with it in accordance with 
specific standards and measures, which each Arab country will 
set according to its own national interests and within the 
framework of its full sovereignty over its territory and 
national resources. 
  -- The Arabs need to formulate a comprehensive strategic 
concept specifying higher Arab interests and a united Arab stand 
regarding the challenges of peace, regional cooperation, and its 
limits. 
  -- Efforts toward Arab reconciliation should continue 
preparing to mobilize Arab integration efforts. The latter will 
be turned into a pillar of Arab potential when confronting the 
coming challenges. 
  Answering a question, the secretary general said that the 
Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles provided great 
hope, much greater than what was actually written into the text. 
(We do not have time to discuss this agreement or analyze its 
articles). But evidence shows that the road to the expected 
peace gave Israel the impression and feeling that the Arab 
world's market, which contains over 150 million consumers, could 
compensate for what it might have to relinquish regionally or 
diplomatically. The greatest compensation for the shattering of 
Israel's dream of becoming Greater Israel from the Nile to the 
Euphrates has been the alternative dream of becoming the 
economic superpower that can invade the Arab markets as it 
pleases. It believes that it has an economic advantage that 
enables it to invade Arab markets, since the net domestic 
product per capita in Israel is seven times greater than that on 
the West Bank and 14 times that in the Gaza Strip. The net 
national product per capita in Israel amounts to nearly $11,000, 
whereas in the West Bank it amounts to $2,000 and in the Gaza 
Strip, $1,300. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: This is the way Israel looks at the 
other Arab countries when contemplating the peace. I believe it 
is useful to keep in mind on this occasion that peace with Egypt 
did not allow Israel to enter the Arab world. This was because 
Egypt was greatly concerned about not establishing relations 
with Israel at the expense of its relations with the Arab world. 
This leads me reiterate my earlier statement that peace is not 
a gift or present from Israel to the Arabs. In fact, the 
contrary is true; Israel is the one that desperately needs peace 
and cooperation, which will not be realized except through its 
comprehensive and full withdrawal from all occupied Arab 
territories. 
  Answering a question, the secretary general affirmed that 
the 
Israeli boycott will continue as long as Israel occupies any 
part of Arab territory. 
  He added that the peace process, which the Arab League 
supports in accordance with international resolutions, still has 
many obstacles and difficulties to overcome, and this is only to 
be expected. However, insistence on attaining the objective and 
preserving cohesion are two basic issues for realizing the 
desired goals. 
  The secretary general called on the Arabs to seriously 
consider establishing an Arab Free Trade Area (AFTA), along the 
lines of NAFTA and the rest of the big economic groupings. He 
said: I believe that the time periods provided by the GATT 
treaty allow us to set up this area with the objective of 
determining the best ways to market our Arab products in view of 
the international competition that is characteristic of the 21st 
century.

  [Text] Algiers, March 11 (AFP)--A thousand prisoners, 
including at least 280 Moslem fundamentalists, escaped in a mass 
jail break after Islamic guerrillas attacked the prison holding 
them, reliable sources here said Friday [11 March]. 
  Four prison warders were killed in Thursday's jail-break at 
Tazoult some 400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of the capital. 
  The prisoners escaped when an unknown number of assailants 
stormed the prison during the Ramadan meal break at 1800 GMT 
when security was lax, the sources added. 
  One hundred common-law prisoners returned to the prison 
after 
the jail break -- the most spectacular since the start of 
fundamentalist violence in Algeria two years ago. 
  No official confirmation was immediately available. 
  Tazoult prison accommodates 3,000 detainees, many of them 
considered particularly dangerous. 
  Of the Islamic fundamentalists who escaped, several had been 
sentenced to death. 
  Last November three armed fundamentalists attacked Sidi 
Ghiles prison, near Cherchell, seriously wounding the governor 
but no detainees escaped. 
  In July 60 Islamic guerrillas escaped from Mers-el-Kebir 
military prison, near Oran. Five fugitives were later killed by 
security forces. 
  In early 1991, 103 detainees escaped from Blida prison, near 
here, after an attack by an armed Islamic group. 
  In mid-1992 another 20 Islamic extremists escaped from a 
police van during their transfer from Algiers' Serkadji prison 
to Tazoult. 
  The Algerian authorities have rounded up thousands in a 
crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists who launched a bloody 
guerrilla war against the secular administration following the 
January 1992 cancellation of a general election the now outlawed 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.

  [Excerpt] Algiers, March 12 (AFP) -- Security forces were 
engaged in a massive manhunt Saturday for about 1,000 prisoners, 
including 100 Moslem fundamentalists on death row, who escaped 
when Islamic guerrillas stormed their prison, reliable sources 
said. 
  Police, gendarmes and troops launched a joint security sweep 
using helicopters to search the mountainous area near Tazoult, 
400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of the capital, following 
Thursday's mass breakout. 
  Their search is being hampered by the difficult terrain 
which 
nationalist fighters used to hole up during the 1954-62 war of 
independence from France. 
  The Algerian authorities has so far refused to officially 
confirm the escape, the most spectacular since the start of 
fundamentalist violence in Algeria two years ago. 
  The Algerian authorities have rounded up thousands in a 
crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists who launched a bloody 
guerrilla war against the secular administration following the 
January 1992 cancellation of a general election the now outlawed 
Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. 
  According to the sources around 150 Islamic guerrillas 
attacked the prison around 7:00 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday 
during the Ramadan meal break when security was lax, killing 
four prison warders, the sources added. 
  It was not clear whether the operation had been launched by 
the Islamic Group (GIA) or its rival Armed Islamic Movement 
(MIA), the sources said. 
  Some 400 fundamentalists serving life sentences also escaped 
in the jail break, as well as 200 criminals with common law 
convictions. 
  Tazoult prison accommodates 3,000 detainees, many of them 
considered particularly dangerous. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Justice Ministry issued today a statement in 
which it announces that on Thursday [10 March], an armed group 
launched a fierce attack against Tazoul penitentiary center, 
formerly known as Lambese, in Batna wilaya, when people were 
breaking the Ramadan fast. 
  The statement indicates that following an exchange of fire 
with prison guards, the attackers managed to destroy alarm 
devices and stormed the prison, thanks to collusion from two 
members of the prison staff, according to initial investigations. 
  The statement adds that as a result of this assault, a 
number 
of persons convicted of assassination and acts of sabotage 
managed to escape. During the attack and resistance from the 
guards, the assailants killed one guard and seriously injured 
another four. They also took seven guards hostage. 
  Following this operation, the combined forces took the 
necessary security measures to rearrest the escapees and the 
assailants. So far, these forces have been able to apprehend 
around 39 persons. Another five have been killed during an 
exchange of fire. The manhunt and combing operation continues.

  [Text] President of the Republic Lieutenant General 'Umar 
al-Bashir has congratulated the Sudanese masses on the coming of 
the blessed 'Id al-Fitr, calling for adherence to solidarity, 
altruism and remembrance of God. 
  In his address to the citizens to mark the coming of the 
blessed 'Id al-Fitr, his excellency referred to the oppression 
directed against Muslims in many parts of the Islamic world, 
particularly in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the 
Serbs were murdering Muslims, helped by the conspiracy of 
international silence which prevents the Muslims from obtaining 
arms with which to defend themselves against Serbian aggression, 
while the Zionist criminals kill worshipers in Palestine without 
any regard for Islam. Lt. Gen. 'Umar al-Bashir said that in 
spite of that, hearts have not despaired of the mercy of God, 
for goodness still prevails in Muhamad's nation and in the ranks 
of the mujahedin fighting in God's cause who have come together 
to win victory for God's religion. 
  The president of the Republic praised the fighters of the 
armed forces and the People's Defense Forces for making great 
sacrifices in their efforts to bring security to the south of 
the country. He praised them for sheltering the deprived 
migrants whose property has been destroyed and whose children 
have been kidnapped, having been scorned in their efforts to 
uphold the unity and sovereignty of Sudan. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir said: We (?foresee) that peace will come 
soon by virtue of the efforts being made inside the country to 
secure the fearful, feed the hungry, and to repair what the war 
has destroyed; also by virtue of the mediation efforts being 
made by the African brothers to bring the parties to the 
negotiating table. On the occasion of the blessed auspicious 
'Id al-Fitr, his excellency called for peace aspired to by the 
sons of Sudan at home with the help of friends and brothers.

  [Text] Khartoum, 12 Mar (PANA) -- Two suspects in the 
bloody attack on the Ansar al-Sunnah mosque in Khartoum, on 
Friday [11 March] night confessed to the (?attack and said) that 
it was meant to eliminate Islamic leaders in Sudan. Muhammad 
'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khalifi and Muhammad al-Mahi told 
interrogators on Sudan television that their group, Takfir and 
Hijrah, believes that present day Muslims are "infidels". "All 
the contemporary Muslim society is infidel and has got to be 
fought including the leadership of all Sudanese fundamentalist 
groups," said Khalifi. 
  The attack on the mosque in Omdurman on 4 February claimed 
the lives of 19 worshipers and wounded others. 
  Khalifi said the attackers wanted the head of the Ansar 
al-Sunnah group, Zubayr Muhammad Hamzah, who led Friday prayers 
at the mosque. He said their hit-list included a Muslim 
fundamentalist who was leader of the dissolved National Islamic 
Front, Hasan al-Turabi, and two leaders of the Muslim 
brotherhood, Hibir Yusuf and Sulayman Abu-Naru. 
  Khalifi was shown on television still suffering from 
injuries 
he sustained in the shoot-out with security forces on 5 
February, in which two other assailants, Yasir Muhammad Api and 
'Abd-al-Baqi Yusuf, were killed. He said their hit list also 
included veterans of the war in Afghanistan who lived and worked 
with an exiled Saudi businessman, Usamah Bin Ladin, whose villa 
the group also stormed. 
  Khalifi told an investigator that his group does not pray in 
mosques, "because the mosques of today are frequented by 
infidels". He said he is a descendant of a family that emigrated 
early this century from the desert area of Najd in today's Saudi 
Arabia and settled in Libya. He said that his father works for 
the Sirte Oil Company in Libya. Al-Mahi said Khalifi's two 
accomplices were originally members of the Ansar al-Sunnah 
group, who broke away because of "certain differences". Al-Mahi 
said he participated in the planning, but refused to take part 
in the assault "because it will destroy the image of our group". 
  He said they targeted the Ansar al-Sunnah mosque and the 
Islamic militant leaders "because these leaders did not declare 
war against Muslim mysticisms (sufi Moslems), who are seen by 
our group as enemies of Allah". 
  Worshipers at the Ansar al-Sunnah group also believe Muslim 
sufis are infidels. Asked why he did not report the plan to the 
police, he replied: "since the group believes all the society is 
infidel, we should not deal with or come in contact with any of 
its organizations, including the police." 
  The Ministry of the Interior, in a statement after the 
television interview, said that the suspects would be put on 
trial as soon as investigations were completed. It also 
promised to give them a fair trial.

<F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Ma'luf, Raghidah Dirgham, 'Ali Nun, and </F>
Jalal al-Mashtah: "Washington Tells PLO To Negotiate 
Unconditionally"] 
  [Excerpts] Washington, New York, London, Moscow -- Over the 
past 48 hours the United States has escalated its position, 
preventing the Security Council voting on a resolution on the 
Hebron massacre, on the pretext of a disagreement over one word 
in the draft resolution. Also, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher requested President Yasir 'Arafat to resume the 
negotiations with Israel "without prior conditions." While 
Moscow announced that Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit 
the region today. 
  Responding to this, a high-ranking Palestinian source 
contacted by AL-HAYAH accused Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S. 
coordinator of the peace process, and the official in charge of 
the Middle East at the National Security Council "of returning 
to complete bias toward Israel and exploiting President 
Clinton's preoccupation with domestic matters to take control of 
U.S. foreign policy." [passage omitted] 
  A PLO official, who asked to remain anonymous, pointed out 
that Christopher had phoned President 'Arafat and demanded that 
the PLO resume the negotiations without any prior conditions or 
agree to hold meetings between Palestinian and Israeli officials. 
  The official said: "It is clear that the U.S. Administration 
is exerting pressure (on the PLO) in Israel's favor through its 
threat to use the veto." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Regarding presidential activities, President 
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at noon today at the Carthage Palace met 
with the Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. [passage omitted]. 
  President Yasir 'Arafat said that his meeting with His 
Excellency the President dealt with the deliberations of the UN 
Security Council regarding the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi 
mosque. In this connection he said that the fact that the 
Council has not adopted a resolution seriously affects the 
situation inside the occupied territories as a whole. He added 
that he had informed President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of the 
aspects of the message he received last night from the U.S. 
Secretary of State Mr. Warren Christopher which dealt with the 
importance of the continuation and movement forward of the 
peace process. President 'Arafat renewed in this regard the 
Palestinian stance which stresses the necessity of issuing a 
strong resolution by the Security Council which takes into 
account the issue of Jerusalem and the condemnation of the 
attack on the al-Ibrahimi mosque and the adoption of immediate 
international measures to protect the Palestinian people. Mr. 
Arafat said that he had thanked President Zine El Abidine Ben 
Ali for the efforts he had made one more than one level to 
overcome these difficulties, hoping to arrive at a resolution 
that protect the Palestinian people from all attacks.

  [Text] Tunis, March 11 (AFP) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev arrived here Friday for talks with PLO chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat aimed at reviving the Middle East peace process. 
  Kozyrev, arriving from Israel, told reporters he was 
bringing 
"certain ideas" and an important message from Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, but did not give details. He would stay in Tunis 
for several hours. 
  "I have come to express our support and determination to 
prevent the enemies of peace from undermining the efforts" to 
keep the peace talks going, Kozyrev said, before meeting 'Arafat. 
  "It is a question now of focusing efforts to save the peace 
process," he added. 
  Kozyrev was also expected to meet Tunisian Foreign Minister 
Habib Ben Yahia. 
  Officials said 'Arafat earlier discussed the peace process 
with Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. 
  The PLO leader deplored the UN Security Council's failure to 
adopt a resolution condemning the Hebron massacre and calling 
for the deployment of an international force in the occupied 
territories. 
  The delay was having "a very serious negative impact on the 
whole situation" in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank, 
'Arafat said after the meeting. 
  Kozyrev held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
in Jerusalem Friday, during which Rabin called on the 
co-sponsors of the Middle East peace talks, Russia and the 
United States, to work together to revive the peace process. 
  However, Israeli state radio said a Russian proposal to 
stage 
a new Middle East peace conference was not discussed during 
Kozyrev's talks with Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  The proposal was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister 
Igor Ivanov Wednesday, after a Middle East tour during which he 
met twice with 'Arafat, as well as with Rabin and Peres. 
  Moscow has argued that the February 25 massacre of 30 Arab 
worshipers by a Jewish settler in Hebron has derailed the 
negotiating process and that another international conference is 
needed, along the lines of the 1991 Madrid conference which 
launched the peace process.

  [Text] An official Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated 
the following: 
  On 10 March, senior officials representing the governments 
of 
the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey met in Ankara to 
discuss the so-called Operation Provide Comfort for Kurds, as 
well as the situation in northern Iraq. 
  The representatives of these countries issued a press 
statement in which they allowed themselves to interfere in 
Iraq's internal affairs. They have also launched lies and 
allegations, full of fallacies, about Iraq's domestic situation, 
in an attempt to distort facts that are no longer a secret to 
world public opinion. 
  We strongly condemn this blatant interference in Iraq's 
domestic affairs by the parties that met in Ankara. The 
deteriorating situation and the spread of crime and looting and 
killing in the governorates of al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk 
are caused by the illegal and illegitimate action carried out by 
the governments of these four countries when they imposed, by 
brute force, a no-fly zone in northern Iraq. They have also 
encouraged rebel gangs to tamper with the region. 
  The official Foreign Ministry spokesman added: Respecting 
Iraq's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity has 
one expression, namely, stopping the interference in Iraq's 
domestic affairs and lifting the illegal and illegitimate ban on 
flights in northern Iraq imposed by the governments of these 
states. 
  The official spokesman denounced the fact that the press 
statement issued by the representatives of the four countries 
addressed the internal situation in Iraq and spoke about it in 
the language of a custodian. The spokesman said: Iraq strongly 
condemns this rude attempt and thinks that the press statement 
issued in Ankara reflects the true interventionist policy 
pursued by the Government of the United States and its allies 
against Iraq and the region. 
  The official Foreign Ministry spokesman asserted that the 
Iraqi leadership and people will not allow any party to 
interfere in their domestic affairs and that all attempts by the 
governments of the countries that seek to perpetuate the 
abnormal situation prevailing in northern Iraq will definitely 
fail. Our Kurdish people in Iraq will be the first to defeat 
these attempts. 
  On the stand of the Turkish Government, the official 
spokesman said that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry has cautioned the 
Turkish side through a number of official memorandums declaring 
that Turkey's participation in the illegitimate and illegal 
actions of the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq 
contravenes the relations of good-neighborliness and runs 
totally counter to the UN Charter, international law and the 
Iraqi-Turkish border treaty of 1926. 
  The Iraqi Foreign Ministry has also frequently notified the 
Turkish side that Turkey's problems should not be tackled by 
depending on the abnormal situation created by the Americans and 
their allies in northern Iraq and dealing with outlawed rebels 
who are wreaking havoc in the region. We also cautioned our 
Turkish neighbors against the gravity of double policies and 
double-dealing. We told them that such policies cannot but cause 
more difficulties and gravely harm Turkey's interests as well as 
Iraq's, especially since the Americans and their allies care 
about nothing but their selfish interests and wicked ambitions 
in the region. They will neither respect Turkey's nor anybody 
else's interests.

  [Text] In light of the large scale barbaric attack launched 
by tyrant Saddam's forces in the past few days on the marshlands 
of the governorates of al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah 
in south Iraq, a responsible source in the Supreme Assembly of 
the Islamic Revolution in Iraq [SAIRI] has stated the following: 
  The forces of the tyrant Saddam's regime launched a sweeping 
barbaric attack in the past few days on south Iraq's marshlands 
in the Governorates of al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah. 
Four divisions were used in the attack. Reports from SAIRI 
sources in south Iraq have confirmed that this large attack was 
launched on several fronts in the direction of the residential 
areas and villages of the marshlands triangle in the al-Basrah, 
al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah Governorates. The tyrant's forces 
prepared for this attack with intensive artillery shelling of 
the residential areas of the marshlands, killing and wounding 
dozens of civilians who fled in panic from their villages and 
houses and are now living among the reeds without food, water, 
or medicine. The regime's forces are continuing to chase the 
fleeing citizens by firing their long-range artillery on them at 
random. 
  Citizens coming from these areas have confirmed that the 
regime's forces are continuing their acts of destruction and 
burning in the areas of (Nahr Salih), (Abu Julan), al-Dal'ah, 
al-Badriyah, [words indistinct], (Abu Jawlanah), (Abu Subat), 
(Abu al-Nirki), and (al- Sihabi). The afflicted families fled 
deep into the marshlands where they are now suffering from 
thirst and hunger due to shortages of food and water. 
  The SAIRI reports added that the Republican Guards forces 
remain in a state of maximum alert and deployed on the edges of 
the marshlands in preparation for launching a still larger 
attack than the current one. The reports also said that 
criminal 'Ali Hasan al- Majid, tyrant Saddam's defense minister, 
personally led the current offensive from the former 
headquarters of the 11th Division which lies between the areas 
of Umm al-Shuwayj and (al-Khuyut) in the (al- Mudaynah) 
Governorate. 
  Tyrant Saddam's regime aims with this barbaric crime to 
implement a new stage in its infernal scheme to destroy the 
marshlands areas completely and turn them into a desert not fit 
for habitation and to force its people who have been living 
there since the dawn of history to leave so that the regime can 
have full control of these areas which are known as centers of 
steadfastness and resistance to Saddam's regime and his criminal 
gang. The Saddam regime's real war of genocide against an 
historic area known for its human civilization constitutes a 
blatant challenge to the will of the international community and 
the UN resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 688 of 
8 April 1991, which prohibits the Iraqi regime from suppressing 
the civilians of Iraq. This is a direct and grave threat to 
security, peace, and stability in the region and the world. The 
current situations in southern Iraq's marshland areas have 
reached the stage where it has become difficult to remain silent 
or maintain the position of spectator. Hence, we call on the 
international community, its bodies, its humanitarian 
organizations, and its media to condemn the barbaric aggressive 
action of Saddam's regime and to support the Iraqi people in its 
tribulation. 
  A responsible SAIRI source has also appealed to the United 
Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to act quickly 
to take measures to stop the genocide being waged against the 
inhabitants of the marshlands, especially as the Security 
Council and other UN organizations have the documents and 
evidence that confirm that the marshland areas are being 
subjected to a real war of genocide. This was also confirmed by 
the reports of the rapporteur of human rights in Iraq [words 
indistinct] who has repeatedly called for sending UN observers 
to Iraq to monitor human rights violations in this country. 
  The source said: We call on the Security Council to 
implement the rapporteur's report and to speed up the dispatch 
of inspection and observer teams to the marshlands and south 
Iraq where there is an urgent and persistent need for them more 
than ever since there is no security for the civilian citizens 
as a result of the oppression, campaigns of annihilation, 
killings, and the economic and military siege. He added: We 
appeal to the Security Council to compel the Iraqi regime to 
comply with and implement the clauses of Resolution 688, the 
most important of which is the clause on stopping the 
suppression of civilians. As previous experiences have shown, 
this regime complies with the Security Council only when it is 
forced and coerced to do so because it has rebelled against the 
international will and does not respect the laws and norms 
approved by international law. We also call on all the world 
humanitarian organizations, especially relief organizations, to 
act quickly to relieve the inhabitants of the marshlands in the 
south and declare our readiness to cooperate with these 
organizations so as to get food, medicine, clothes, and other 
relief to the afflicted citizens. 
  On this occasion, we address our appeal to the countries and 
governments of the Arab and Islamic world and to all the Muslim 
brothers in the world to condemn the Saddam regime's savage 
actions against their Arab and Muslim brothers in south Iraq, 
show solidarity with them, and to give them succor.

<F P=106> [Article by Nuri Najm al-Marsumi: "The Embargo and the </F>
Aggression; A Look Into What has Happened, and Into Available 
Options"] 
  [Text] On 6 August 1990, and per Resolution 661, the UN 
Security Council imposed an economic embargo against Iraq. 
Paragraph 1 of the resolution states in no uncertain terms that 
the resolution shall go into effect if Iraq does not honor the 
provisions enshrined in Paragraph 2 of UN Security Council 
Resolution 660 of 2 August 1990, which calls for the withdrawal 
of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. From a legal point of view, this 
means that the fact that Iraqi troops were withdrawn from Kuwait 
requires the world to revoke the economic embargo clamped on 
Iraq, because the (apparent) reasons and justifications for 
instituting the embargo in the first place have been removed and 
the root cause of the conflict has been resolved by this very 
troop withdrawal. Nonetheless, the United States has not allowed 
the UN Security Council to simply stop at the limits of its 
relevant resolutions. For, since 26 February 1991, when Iraq, of 
its own volition and in accordance with its own strategic 
calculations, decided to withdraw its troops from Kuwait, these 
resolutions should have been relegated to oblivion. Since then, 
the United States has continued to pursue Iraq, even after the 
halt to hostilities and after a cease-fire came into effect. It 
forced the UN Security Council to pass Resolution 687, which 
contains the terms of a cease-fire between Iraq and the hostile 
military coalition that carried out the aggression. 
  On 1 March 1991, a new phase in the U.S. policy on Iraq was 
heralded. Since then, the United States has exploited the 
international changes in the aftermath of the collapse of the 
former Soviet Union and the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact to 
continue to pursue Iraq politically and economically, and to 
intervene in its domestic affairs. This is because the United 
States was not content with the colossal damage it caused to 
Iraq and with the immense strategic and financial gains it made 
in the form of cash payments from Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, 
and Kuwait, or in the form of sales and investment contracts it 
has concluded with the Arabian Gulf regimes. The United States 
is not content with all this. It believes that the continued 
pursuit of the Iraqi political regime, which has held out 
against U.S. aggression and colonialist policies, is the basic 
guarantee to safeguard these gains. It also believes that the 
continued pursuit of a policy aimed at subjugating and 
dominating the Middle Eastern regimes that took part in the 
anti-Iraq aggression requires a weak and "powerless Iraq." 
  That is why the Americans have moved the goalposts and 
fabricated pretexts and excuses to perpetuate the embargo and 
thwart efforts to lift it, either partially or entirely. 
  Early on, when the U.S. arms scandal known as Irangate, 
surfaced during the Iraq-Iran war, the Iraqi leadership realized 
that the United States does not want a powerful Iraq. It has 
done, and is sill doing, all it can to weaken Iraq, either 
through the continuation of the war with Iran or through 
fabricating excuses and pretexts to attack it militarily, in 
cooperation with the Zionist entity, in order to destroy the 
components of its industrial and military renaissance. This 
approach became clear after Iraq achieved its decisive victory 
over Iran, thus putting an end to the eight-year war. 
  Iraq's awareness of the intentions of the United States and 
the Zionist entity and their schemes, has prompted Iraq to react 
in a manner aimed to foil the U.S.-Zionist schemes against Iraq 
and its national and pan-Arab regime. Therefore, the struggle 
has continued because Iraq has adhered to its territorial 
integrity and independence and has opposed attempts at 
encroaching on its sovereignty, represented by the exclusion 
zones and attempts by the inspection committees of the Special 
Commission to exceed the limits of their missions in Iraq. Iraq 
has also rejected every proposal that could harm the dignity of 
Iraq and its people. Therefore, threats to mount aggression 
continued and Iraq was exposed to two treacherous aggressions on 
13 January 1993 and on 27 June 1993. 
  In addition to Iraq's steadfastness and obvious political 
stand, the Iraqi leadership has continued to conduct itself in a 
logical, clear, legal, and principled manner, enabling Iraqi 
diplomacy to present its case in a clear and flexible way that 
has won it a respectable position in the UN lobbies and in world 
public opinion. Iraq has not been obstinate in its stand toward 
the Security Council and its unjust resolutions despite the fact 
that as originally claimed, these resolutions were connected 
with Iraq's presence in Kuwait, a matter that was decided when 
Iraqi units withdrew from Kuwait. Iraq completely implemented 
the Security Council's demands as enunciated in its resolutions, 
especially Resolution No. 687 related to the chemical, 
biological, and nuclear weapons, and missiles with a range 
exceeding 150 km. Iraq also agreed to abide by the contents of 
Resolution 715 related to the future monitoring of weapons 
manufacturing. 
  One after another, the inspection committees reaffirmed that 
Iraq extended assistance and facilities to enable them to carry 
out their missions after they themselves adhered to their limits 
and respected Iraq's dignity and requirements of sovereignty. 
There are no commitments remaining for Iraq to implement. 
Therefore, the Security Council, in accordance with Paragraph 
22 of Resolution No. 687, should announce that Iraq has 
implemented what it was asked to implement and that the ban on 
basic commodity imports and on exports of Iraqi-source products 
and the ban on financial transactions connected with Iraq as 
stated in Resolution 661 of 1990 are now invalid as clearly 
stipulated in Paragraph 22. 
  Iraq has also been able to avert attempts to "develop" the 
U.S. conditions and reacted with evidence and documents against 
these attempts. The latest U.S. setback was represented by the 
announcement of the special investigation committee on the use 
of chemical weapons in southern Iraq, in which the committee 
found no evidence to support claims that Iraq has used such 
weapons. 
  The Americans now have no excuse or any logical 
justification 
left to convince anyone. The discussion on Iraq between the 
head of the Europe and the Middle East subcommittee of the House 
of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee and Robert 
Pelletreau, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern 
affairs, is a clear indication of the total lack of reason in 
the U.S. Administration's rationale. Pelletreau stated that 
"the international alliance continues to be firm in supporting 
the Iraqi embargo," that "the embargo helps put pressure on the 
Iraqi government," and that "in any case, Iraq continues to 
violate all Security Council resolutions, and therefore, the 
conditions for lifting sanctions on this or that issue is too 
early to consider and should not be discussed." 
  Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Hamilton 
asked the assistant secretary of state: What is required from 
Iraq in order to lift oil embargo? Pelletreau replied: I am 
hesitant to give a reply because this is premature as long as 
Iraq has not done anything in the first place. 
  Hamilton replied with another question: Does the U.S. 
Administration want something more than abidance by the UN 
resolutions on the destruction of weapons of mass destruction 
before lifting the oil embargo? 
  Pelletreau answered: This subject concerns the allied states 
as a whole, and I want to say that I am not sure that it is wise 
to start discussing the subject of when to lift the embargo. 
  Hamilton said: I have a big problem in understanding what is 
required from Iraq in order to secure the lifting of the oil 
embargo. If I have such a big problem, it is possible that Iraq 
also has a problem in understanding your position. 
  Pelletreau failed to specify what is required from Iraq 
after 
the resolutions it implemented, and he emphasized the importance 
of maintaining the unity of the alliance. Hamilton asked: How 
can we maintain the alliance's unity if we do not have a clear 
position? How can we convince the other members of the alliance 
if you are unable to convince me of what Iraq should do to 
secure the lifting of the oil embargo? 
  This is an example of the discussions taking place in the 
United States. Such discussions emphasize that, in its position 
on Iraq, the United States has only political slogans that are 
not based on legal justification or logic. The only thing it 
wants to do is harm Iraq and to use the international community 
in general, and the Security Council in particular, to continue 
to harm Iraq. 
  The failure of U.S. pretexts during the previous stage was 
accompanied by a serious fissure within the anti-Iraq alliance. 
There are several reasons for these changes, including the 
following: 
  - The alliance's main countries became aware of the serious 
harm they suffered as a result of the U.S. policy before, 
during, and after the military aggression against Iraq, 
especially after the U.S. endeavor to tighten its grip on oil 
resources and to link Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and other countries 
with agreements that secure U.S. control without considering the 
interests of its alliance partners. 
  - Most of the republics of the former Soviet Union and the 
East European countries became aware of U.S. attempts aimed at 
marginalizing and impoverishing them to take revenge on their 
peoples, along with Russia's reemergence as a power with 
international weight and influence. 
  - The U.S. policies failed in attempts to foster its slogans 
about its unilateral leadership of the world, especially after 
dealing with the foreign problems in Europe, Africa, and Latin 
America. 
  - The United State fabricated a number of economic problems 
with Japan and Europe and tried to solve its internal economic 
crisis at the expense of the peoples of Europe, Japan, etc. 
  When the peoples of the world began to view Iraq as the 
victim of a real colonialist game with no legitimate moral 
motives, it simply entrenched the fissure within the antagonist 
alliance. The Iraqi ability to defend the homeland and to 
reconstruct what the aggressors destroyed, and the sound 
policies adopted by Iraq in dealing with the crises created 
directly by the United States and the Security Council, won it 
the confidence and respect of the reasonable states and 
political and social forces in the world, including certain 
powers and movements that, until recently, were viewed as part 
of the antagonist alliance. 
  Given all this, one can say that the current international 
and regional circumstances have consolidated Iraq's position and 
legitimate cause, and provided a serious and true opportunity 
for lifting the unfair embargo clamped upon it. At the same 
time, however, these circumstances are causing the enemies, 
whose interests have been served by the aggression and the 
embargo, to suffer from a hysteria that could push them into 
adventures, or to continue to take positions that conflict with 
the principles of fairness and justice when the embargo is 
reviewed by the UN Security Council. The U.S. Administration is 
confused. It has nothing left except hostile political slogans. 
It is persisting with these slogans, aided in this by certain 
Arab rulers who are suffering from serious domestic crises. 
These rulers believe that the lifting of the embargo could 
accelerate their downfall if their domestic crises remain 
unresolved. 
  The principles and constants that have governed Iraq's 
conduct during the recent past will remain unchanged. 
Nonetheless, this conduct must reflect an understanding of what 
has been achieved, and the changes that have taken place in the 
region and the world. 
  To begin with, the lifting of the embargo must be Iraq's 
prime objective, given that the embargo is a continuation of the 
military aggression, albeit harsher and more harmful. Now that 
Iraq has met all the obligations enshrined in the relevant UN 
Security resolutions, and that the root cause of the conflict, 
which was behind the deluge of resolutions, has been resolved, 
the UN Security Council is required to revoke in a clear 
resolution all embargo measures, declaring that this is prompted 
by Iraq's compliance with relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  Heated and contentious debates are expected to be held at 
the 
UN Security Council's closed and open meetings. It is true that 
most permanent and nonpermanent members of the UN Security 
Council are for lifting the sanctions, either partially or 
entirely. However, the U.S. Administration is expected to wield 
the big stick to prevent the UN Security Council from taking a 
fair and reasonable resolution lifting the embargo. One cannot 
rule out the likelihood that the U.S. Administration or its 
agents in the region might create incidents to form a negative 
political climate in order to influence the UN Security Council 
deliberations. Hence, we need to be alert, watchful, and ready 
to handle incidents as they unfold in accordance with their 
importance and seriousness. Likewise, we must draw the world's 
attention to the fact that Iraq is serious about its efforts to 
lift the embargo, that it is capable of acting to protect the 
homeland and safeguard the future of its generations, and that 
the Iraqi national struggle will take whatever form will ensure 
the achievement of the prime objective. 
  We urge the UN Security Council members to examine the issue 
of lifting the sanctions, and to seriously comply with relevant 
resolutions this time. For Iraq will not remain idle when it 
sees the continued harm and aggression mounted against it, and 
Iraqis, of all categories and social strata -- be they in 
northern Iraq, southern Iraq, eastern Iraq, or western Iraq -- 
are currently rallying around their historic leader Saddam 
Husayn to thwart the aggression once and for all, and achieve 
the decisive victory.

  [Text] Baghdad, 14 Mar (INA) -- The AL-'IRAQ newspaper has 
asserted that both the Security Council and the UN Special 
Commission, led by Rolf Ekeus, are making a grave mistake if 
they think that they will not be held accountable for their 
continued attempts to avoid giving a specific date for the 
lifting of the embargo. They are also greatly mistaken if they 
think the Iraqi people will accept remaining at the mercy of the 
inspection agencies and their unfair conditions. 
  In an editorial today, the newspaper wonders: Does the 
Security Council think that the Iraqi leadership will continue 
to wait for unspecific and vague dates as to when the unfair 
embargo will be fully or partially lifted? 
  The paper adds: Do the United States, world Zionism, and the 
clique of agents and traitors think they can maintain the 
embargo indefinitely through delaying tactics and 
procrastination? Do they think they can achieve this by 
obstructing any positive stand the Security Council should take 
in return for Iraq's fulfillment of its obligations toward 
Security Council resolutions, despite the fact that these 
resolutions are harsh, severe, and illegitimate? 
  The paper highlights the important, valuable speech made by 
President Saddam Husayn when he received cabinet members and 
well-wishers on the 'Id al-Fitr. The paper cites his excellency 
as asserting that whatever the degree of Iraq's cooperation, 
commitment, and response, the party representing the Security 
Council will continue to be evasive, disregard facts, and give 
tendentious explanations and lame excuses to weasel out of its 
commitments to close the file of the embargo once and for all. 
  The paper says it is laughable that the Security Council, 
which is influenced by the United States, claims that it is 
concerned about the sovereignty of Iraq at a time when the 
members of the Security Council violate this sovereignty and 
draw their own lines of latitude and longitude in order to 
achieve familiar, malicious objectives that threaten the very 
concept of our sovereignty. 
  The paper notes Rolf Ekeus's procrastination, saying it is 
another part of the ugly game. The chairman of the Special 
Commission is a senior diplomat and international official who 
is supposed to keep his word and respect his decisions and 
dates. This situation arouses sorrow and regret over the moral 
deterioration of the Security Council. One time Ekeus says that 
Iraqi compliance should be tested for three months; on another 
occasion, he says six months; and sometimes he says not less 
than a year. However, Ekeus has so far not told us when this 
probationary period will begin in order for us to know when it 
will end. Despite all of this, they talk about our credibility. 
Have you ever known greater hypocrisy or worse maneuvering 
tactics? 
  The paper adds: In light of our bitter experience with the 
Security Council, we realize that the ugly game aims, first and 
foremost, to exhaust the people of Iraq and manipulate its 
resources. The greater conspiracy -- whose features were clear 
even before the U.S.-Zionist aggression -- targets our 
development, cultural progress, the future of our generations, 
and our legitimate right to keep pace with the age and look 
forward to the 21st century and to achieving progress and 
development on all levels. 
  AL-'IRAQ says: After a few days, the Security Council will 
begin its periodic discussions on lifting the sanctions. The 
patient and steadfast Iraqis will not be affected or weakened if 
the Security Council again fails to comply with its commitments 
under pressure from the United States and Zionism. Our people 
and leadership will face any such situation in a way that 
maintains the momentum of their earnest work to face challenges. 
  Concluding, AL-'IRAQ stresses that the lofty Iraq will not 
go 
back on its national and pan-Arab course. It will remain the 
edifice of faith, honest principles, and genuine values. Iraq 
will not be shaken by treacherous storms or forces of evil, 
despotism, or falsehood. That is how we are and that is how we 
will continue to be. However, the enemies of God and humanity 
will harvest evil, disgrace, and misfortune.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: President al-Asad's speech to a 
delegation of the 1948 Palestinians has attracted the attention 
of all political and media circles. The address expressed 
unequivocal support for a just and comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East and strongly refuted Israeli claims and attempts to 
mislead world public opinion. President al-Asad noted Syria is 
totally open to the peace process and has offered much to bring 
this process to a successful conclusion. He stressed that our 
delegation to the Washington talks is invested with authority 
and is very trustworthy. Israel's security claims and demands, 
such as upgrading the level of the talks, are part of a pattern 
of prevarication, extortion, and avoidance of the needs of 
peace, topped by withdrawal from the occupied territories and 
recognition of Palestinian rights. 
  For over two years, Arab delegations have heard nothing from 
the Israelis except security pretexts. Upon reviewing 
documented events in UN reports and resolutions, we see that 
Israel has always been the aggressor. Since 1948, Israel has 
been denounced by the United Nations on all fronts of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. Today's events clearly reveal the 
continuation of this premeditated hostile Israeli policy. 
Southern Lebanon, for example, is exposed daily to thousands of 
Israeli shells from the ground, air, and sometimes the sea. 
Palestinian people are daily losing their sons, who are either 
killed or wounded by the bullets of the Israeli Army and 
settlers. 
  After luring the Palestinian negotiating side into an 
agreement whose clauses are almost entirely based on ways and 
means to protect Israeli security and Zionist settlers, Israel 
committed, at the hands of its settlers, the ugliest and most 
serious massacre of the modern age when it killed over 50 
Palestinian citizens in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque while they 
were kneeling in prayer to God. 
  Since 1948, Israeli security has only been a pretext for 
aggression and expansion. Israel launched several wars in the 
name of this alleged security. It forcibly seized Arab lands 
and planted them with settlements. Today, it refuses to return 
these lands, even in exchange for peace and despite the fact 
that its settlements are insecure. No people in the world would 
remain silent over the usurpation of their land. Tomorrow, 
Israel might embark on new aggressions and expansions to protect 
the security of its settlements. 
  In the midst of this cycle of violence, which it itself 
created and which it sustains, Israel is naturally ignoring the 
fact that a real just and comprehensive peace in the region is 
the certain and ideal security guarantee. 
  In his speech to the Palestinian delegation, President 
al-Asad revealed that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Shamir made every possible effort to sabotage the U.S. peace 
initiative, but was forced to go to the Madrid conference 
because of Syria's positive attitude, although he rejected the 
U.S. initiative. Rabin came, and people regarded this as a good 
omen. Substantive issues were discussed in the Washington 
talks, but no substantial progress was made due to continuing 
Israeli prevarication. The question that poses itself is: Is 
Rabin implementing Shamir's plan? It is known that Shamir 
disclosed he was planning for futile negotiations in Washington 
for at least five years, during which he would be able to 
Judaize all the occupied Arab territories and confront the world 
with an accomplished fact. 
  Washington's talks have entered their third year, but the 
Israeli position continues to be the same, not changing even an 
iota. Israel's lies and its rulers' falsehoods are countless. 
Israel has no word or pledge to honor. It claims peace and 
works against it. It claims a desire for a just settlement to 
the conflict in the region, but does all it can to fuel the 
conflict. It claims to protect Palestinians, but slaughters 
them. We shoud remember that a senior Israeli military 
commander refuted all the Rabin government's claims when he told 
the inquiry commission formed to investigate the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre that the Israeli Army had clear orders not to 
attack Zionist settlers, even if they were shooting at Arabs 
with an intent to kill. Thus, the settlers entered the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque and committed the massacre before the very 
eyes and ears of the Israeli Army and with the instigation of 
the Israeli Government. 
  Building peace in the Middle East requires sincere 
intentions, sincere efforts, and a sincere commitment. The 
rulers of Israel possess none. Their intentions are aggressive 
and expansionist, their efforts do not go beyond attempts at 
delusion, and their commitment is missing. Thus far, they have 
not abided by UN principles and resolutions, to which they owe 
their existence. 
  The Arabs, however, will continue the peace process to the 
end and until everyone in this world is convinced that Israel 
and peace are at odds.

of a horrible crime last Sunday, just 48 hours after the hideous 
crime which Israeli settlers had committed in the Ibrahimi 
Mosque in occupied Palestine with the cooperation of the 
occupation army. 
  What is clear from both crimes is: First, Israel is 
launching an unprecedented war of annihilation against the 
Lebanese and the Palestinians aimed at sabotaging Lebanese 
national unity and preventing the reconstruction of Lebanon on 
the one hand, and directing a crushing blow to the peace efforts 
by attacking Muslim and Christian worshippers and spreading an 
atmosphere of religious hostility in the service of the 
opportunist Jewish interests on the other. 
  Second, the crimes in Hebron and Beirut followed Israeli 
threats, which were also directed by the Zionist murder organ 
headed by Yitzhaq Rabin. These threats were strongly directed 
at Lebanon, and the world had expected a large-scale Zionist 
aggression against southern Lebanon. But Zionist militarism has 
struck at an unexpected place -- the Sayyidat al-Najat Church -- 
with a very clear aim, which is to cover up its crime in the 
Ibrahimi Mosque and to create an atmosphere of chaos in Lebanon 
in order to undermine the stability and security which that 
country is enjoying in the era of legitimacy and the al-Ta'if 
Agreement. 
  On the other hand, now that secret and open talks with the 
PLO have led to the Cairo agreement, which was rejected by 
Palestinian popular forces and organizations, and the intifadah 
has intensified in a serious, qualitative manner threatening to 
end the series of concessions which are being made to Israel, 
Israel has resorted as usual to a strike, which even the Nazis 
would have been ashamed of, at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in order 
to intimidate the Palestinians and stop their intifadah, just as 
it did in Dayr Yasin during the establishment of the Zionist 
entity, believing that it could achieve now what it achieved 
then. Israel tried to cover up its crime by placing the 
responsibility on other extremist forces. But, it seems to have 
forgotten that the whole world knows that arming and training 
settlers is done by the Israeli security organs and so the 
Israeli war ministry cannot be entirely absolved from 
encouraging the crime the murder plans.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Silence Over Terrorism," the 
newspaper AL-THAWRAH writes on the UN Security Council's delay 
of its deliberations to adopt a clear and decisive resolution on 
confronting Israel's state terrorism following the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre two weeks ago. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: Calls on the UN Security Council to assume 
its responsibilities, to issue an appropriate resolution, and to 
implement this resolution within a specific period of time are 
due to the fact that Israel has continued its policy of 
occupation and aggression, and that it has continued to evade 
discussion of any issue related to the substance of the peace 
process. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: President al-Asad has stressed the 
importance of dealing with the bases of peace process to the 
Palestinian delegation, to U.S. President Bill Clinton at the 
Geneva summit, and to all officials and delegations that have 
come to Syria or contacted its leadership. He has also stressed 
that the Arabs accepted the U.S. initiative because they viewed 
it as a clear initiative based on the land for peace formula 
always stressed by the Arab side based on UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338. 
  AL-THAWRAH also notes that President Hafiz al-Asad's address 
to the Palestinian delegation has proved once again that Syria 
is committed to the constants of a just and comprehensive peace, 
that Syria will not submit to any pressure or blackmail, and 
that it will not relinquish any of the Arabs' rights. Despite 
all this, Syria wants a comprehensive and full peace. If it is 
not comprehensive, then it is not peace. We, the Arabs, 
constitute one nation and our position is very strong. We have 
a claim to a right. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: In light of this, the UN 
Security Council, particularly the United States, should deal 
decisively with Israel alone, especially since developments 
before and after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre have proven 
that Yitzhaq Rabin's government is implementing the Shamir 
government's plan to prolong the talks. It has continued to 
execute the expansionist Zionist plan of building settlements 
and of killing the Palestinians. The occupation army's soldiers 
and officers admitted this when they spoke about the strict 
orders they received to escalate the killing of Palestinians and 
to give a free hand to the settlers to kill instead of disarming 
and expelling them, along with their settlements, from the 
occupied territories.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Mar (MENA)--Egyptian Ambassador in Israel 
Muhammad Basyuni has stressed Egypt's insistence on the need for 
international supervision to protect the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories to prevent the repetition of the incident 
in Hebron. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Monday, he noted that 
Egypt's stand on the settlement policy is clear and known and 
that it considers the settlements illegal and that they should 
all be removed. He remarked that there is agreement to discuss 
the matter in the final stages of the solution. 
  He expressed his belief that the Israeli-Palestinian talks 
will not be resumed officially until the Security Council passes 
a resolution denouncing the Hebron operation and providing 
protection for the Palestinians. 
  The ambassador denounced Israeli and Western media 
exaggerations and one-upmanship in handling the manifestations 
of violence and terrorism in Egypt and these media's attempts to 
damage Egypt's image abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Major General Hasan </F>
al-Alfi by 'Amr 'Abd-al-Sami' in Cairo on 9 March] 
  [Excerpts] ['Abd-al-Sami'] Reports of the arrest of 25 
terrorists involved in recent bombings in Cairo have aroused 
general satisfaction in Egypt. Meanwhile the terrorists were 
shocked by the reports, which caused them to issue a statement 
on Tuesday announcing a halt to their operations for a week. 
However, the escape of three terrorists, among them Tal'at 
Yasin Hammam (Islamic Group), arouses questions about whether 
these fugitive are capable of carrying out new operations. What 
is your opinion? 
  [Al-Alfi] Anything is possible in the situation we are going 
to talk about. The terrorists' method is "hit and run." It is a 
base method which reflects weakness, not strength. A strong 
organization does what it wants whenever it wants and wherever 
it wants, regardless of the losses. But we note that the 
Terrorists' method does not indicate any sign of strength at 
all. For our part, we are constantly directing strikes against 
terrorist schemes, the most recent of which was the arrest of 
the bombings organization. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] It is said that terrorism poses a threat to 
all Arab and Islamic states. To what extent are Pakistani 
authorities cooperating in this connection, and are there any 
positive signs in this cooperation under the new government 
there? 
  [Al-Alfi] Contacts with Pakistan are still continuing. 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has there been any positive development 
under the new government headed by Benazir Bhutto, which has no 
fundamentalist link, in contrast to the former government of 
Nawaz Sharif? 
  [Al-Alfi] To some extent. 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] What do you mean by "to some extent?" 
  [Al-Alfi] I mean there is a positive development. 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] Has that development produced tangible 
results? 
  [Al-Alfi] Yes, it has produced tangible results, but these 
matters cannot be discussed in the press. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] Have you detected any form of Sudanese or 
Iranian support for recent terrorist activities in Egypt? 
  [Al-Alfi] It is known that there is support, and there is 
information whose details are being examined. States are 
actually involved in these actions. And some states are not 
interested in confronting what is happening on their territory 
in this connection with decisive measures. However, I tell you 
that many cases are under investigation or being heard in the 
court. And it is in the interests of the investigation not to 
say who is behind these operations or reveal information in this 
connection, so that all elements can be completed. [passage 
omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view Libyan allegations that U.S. 
and Israeli intelligence services kidnapped al-Kikhya to give 
these states the right to escalate their campaign against Libya 
and hit it? 
  [Al-Alfi] So far none of what has been said has proved to be 
true. On that issue, I would like to say that al-Kikhya came to 
Egypt with an Algerian passport to attend a conference. He did 
not inform us of that. Besides, he is not a political refugee 
in Egypt. Any political refugee in Egypt is provided with 
protection, surveillance, and security. 
  Al-Kikhya did not request any security. And he was not one 
of those requiring protection, because he was not resident in 
Egypt. He came as an ordinary person of foreign nationality, 
then left the country. [passage omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] How do you view the effect of the future 
situation in Gaza on security in Egypt, especially as regards 
the possibility of some terrorists' infiltrating via the Rafah 
crossing point if the Palestinian-Israeli disagreement over who 
should control this crossing point leads to a formula resulting 
in loopholes in control measures? 
  [Al-Alfi] There are security preparations everywhere, 
especially the outlets and borders in Egypt: east, west, north, 
and south; on land, at sea, and in the air. I have set up a 
special department called the outlets department headed by an 
assistant minister in order to supply the outlets with the 
latest equipment to detect falsification and forgery, uncover 
wanted people and smuggled and banned items, and arrest those 
who infiltrate the borders. This is to be coordinated with the 
border guard in the Armed Forces. 
  We have no fears over the possibility of some terrorists' 
infiltrating, for two reasons: First, we are in control of our 
side of the Rafah crossing point. This side will obviously not 
be subjected to any change, regardless of the formula reached 
between the Palestinians and the Israelis vis-a-vis control over 
the other side in the negotiations concerning the implementation 
of the declaration of principles agreement. 
  Second, both the PLO and Israel are eager to control 
security 
in Gaza, and it cannot be said that one of them is more 
interested in the matter than the other. 
  There is complete agreement that the peace agreement's 
success requires complete vigilance, because any terrorist 
schemes through the Rafah crossing point would have a bigger 
negative impact on the future of peace between the Palestinians 
and Israel than on the situation in Egypt. 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] I am asking that question in particular 
because there are fears that a relationship might be established 
between extremist elements from Hamas, for example, and 
terrorists in Egypt. 
  [Al-Alfi] We are taking account of all that. [passage 
omitted] 
  ['Abd-al-Sami'] Quantities of arms and explosives are seized 
whenever terrorist dens are attacked. Where do the extremists 
get these quantities of arms and explosives, when there are 
tight restrictions imposed on the arms trade and quarries? 
  [Al-Alfi] A major part of them comes from the remnants of 
the past wars in Sinai. To this day we are still seizing dens 
in Sinai containing huge quantities of all types of arms, 
explosives, and ammunition. This is why a comprehensive survey 
of these areas has been launched to destroy this dangerous 
source, which is used by terrorists and other criminals.

  [Text] Cairo, March 11 (AFP)--Gunmen killed four people and 
wounded three Friday [11 March] when they fired shots at a 
Coptic Christian monastery near al-Qusiyah in Upper Egypt, 
sources close to the security services said here. 
  Unidentified assailants opened fire from a car, hitting 
people going toward the al-Moharraq monastery, 11 kilometres 
(seven miles) from al-Qusiyah, which lies 350 kilometres (217 
miles) south of Cairo. 
  The attack took place at around 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT), when 
the traditional iftar meal breaks the fast during the Moslem 
holy month of Ramadan. 
  The timing of the attack and the target indicated the 
victims 
could have been Christians, but there were no details available 
about them or the gunmen who fled the scene. 
  Islamic militants have previously carried out attacks 
against 
Coptic Christians in the same region.

  [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--Four people died and three 
others were wounded this evening when unidentified gunmen fired 
in the direction of the gate of al-Muharraq Monastery in 
al-Qusiyah, Asyut Governorate, and escaped. 
  A responsible security source at the Interior Ministry said 
that at about 1830 today, unidentified men fired at the gate of 
al-Muharraq Monastery in al-Qusiyah, 45 km north of Asyut in 
Upper Egypt. The source added that Safwat Sami Shawqi, a

of Ghabbur Company; Sayf Shafiq Sayf, a 23-year-old peasant; and 
the monastery's priest Nur-al-Qums Binyamin, 45, died as a 
result. 
  The source said the three wounded people were taken to 
al-Qusiyah Hospital for treatment. 
  Officials of the Asyut Security Directorate, the Public 
Security Authority, the Criminology Investigation Department, 
and the Criminology Laboratory went to the scene of the incident 
to investigate. The area is being searched and ambushes are 
being set to arrest the culprits. The prosecution has been 
informed to begin an investigation.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--The Egyptian national unity 
committee denounced last night's criminal attack on the Dayr 
al-Muharraq in al-Qusiyah, one of Egypt's sacred religious 
places respected by all Egyptians, both Muslims and Christians. 
  In a statement it issued today, the committee stressed that 
this aggression is a grave escalation of the attempt to divide 
Egyptians and threaten their national unity, adding that it is 
an aggression against Egypt's Muslims and Christians. 
  The statement appealed to Muslim and Christian forces and 
bodies to rise to responsibility, condemn this criminal act and 
its perpetrators, confront this trend, and work assiduously for 
the unity of all Egyptians under the slogan of: Religion belongs 
to God and the homeland belongs to everyone. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Asyut, 12 Mar (MENA)--Anba Saverios, archbishop of 
al-Muharraq Monastery in al-Qusiyah, has stated that the 
shooting at the monastery yesterday was an isolated incident 
intended to grab media headlines, strike at national unity, and 
divide the nation's two communities. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, the archbishop said the 
incident will have no effect on the relations between Muslims 
and Christians but will make them more determined to adhere to 
national unity. 
  On the circumstances of the incident, he said that at 
approximately 1800 yesterday, a citizen accompanied by his 
relatives arrived in a car to visit the monastery. The head of 
the monastery apologized to them because they could not enter 
the monastery during the period of fasting. He added that while 
the car's passengers were standing outside the monastery, 
unknown people opened fire at the car and its passengers. He 
added that 27 empty cartridges fired from an automatic weapon 
were found at the scene of the incident.

Britons on a Nile cruise after dawn on Sunday but no-one was 
hurt, in the latest of several weekend attacks by suspected 
Islamic militants that killed two priests and six other people. 
  Police escorting the Royal Rhapsody cruise boat fired back 
but the gunmen escaped along the Nile River near the Islamic 
militant stronghold of Asyut, 360 kilometers (216 miles) south 
of Cairo, security services said. 
  The tourists were sailing from Suhaj to the capital Cairo. 
  For the past year police have escorted tour boats in rubber 
dinghies in a broad effort to protect tourists targeted by 
militants seeking to sabotage the Egyptian economy and bring 
down the secular government. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM has 
asked the big powers to stop leveling accusations at the Arab 
countries, especially under the current circumstances, or to 
control them, particularly since there are some sides who are 
committing crimes in broad daylight and no one is taking any 
measures against them. 
  The paper said in its comment for tomorrow, Sunday, that 
most 
of these accusations come from one big power with interests in 
the region. It has some relationship to the issue at which 
accusations are being leveled. The paper added that these 
accusations are not based on anything other than reports 
containing unconfirmed information or guesswork. 
  It added that these accusations are linked to some kind of 
violation of international peace and security, which means that 
the road is now open for taking the necessary resolutions 
accompanied by certain sanctions on the part of the Security 
Council. 
  The paper said that Iraq was previously accused of using gas 
against the Shiites in the marshlands. After investigations, it 
was proven that this had not taken place. Libya was also 
accused of setting up installations for producing chemical 
weapons -- an accusation for which there is no evidence to back 
it up. Similar accusations have been leveled at other Arab 
countries.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH 
has said that the United States, which alone is hampering the 
issuance of an international resolution condemning the Hebron 
massacre, recently proposed a deal to the PLO. This deal 
includes the fact that the United States will agree to a 
resolution stipulating an unarmed international presence in the 
occupied territories in return for a Palestinian commitment to 
resume the peace negotiations. 
  In its editorial for tomorrow, Sunday, the newspaper 
expresses its derision for such an American proposal. It 
wonders whether this was all the U.S. mountain [reference to the 
saying "The mountain hath labored and brought forth a mouse"] 
could produce. It describes the resolution as inadequate, and 
says its contents have been gutted. The international force 
would also be disarmed. In addition, the paper says that 
Washington has not taken into account all the facts that have 
been revealed about the role of the Israeli Army in the 
massacre, insofar as they have to do with their Israeli ally. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH clarifies that all the Zionist massacres 
confirm that if the issue of settlements in the occupied 
territories is not presented and pressure is not put on Israel 
to remove them, or to at least disarm the settlers, then the 
peace that would be established would be one of oppression and 
submission. 
  The paper calls for an Arab stand supporting the 
Palestinians 
when they resume negotiations. At least the Arab cordon states 
should meet to make a united decision regarding the peace 
process. 
  It affirms that as a result of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
Israel is every day reaping new gains. It notes that the latest 
of these gains is the restoration of military cooperation 
between Israel and France after 27 years of estrangement in the 
wake of the June 1967 aggression. 
  The newspaper wonders why Israel gets all this sympathy and 
protection from the West despite the fact that it has never 
stopped its aggression and oppression. The paper says: It must 
be the alliances between politicians and the language of 
self-interest.

  [Text] Cairo, 14 Mar (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR newspaper calls on 
the international community to face up to its political, 
humanitarian, and moral responsibility by reaching a decisive 
and clear resolution on the brutal crime of the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque perpetrated by Israeli extremism under the sponsorship of 
Israeli military and civilian leaders. 
  In an editorial written by its chief editor today, Monday, 
the paper says that the Security Council's failure to pass a 
resolution of denunciation during the past two weeks is 
repulsive and indicates that the aim is to contain the 
revolution of world public opinion against the brutal measures 
against the Palestinian people. 
  The paper calls on the United States to act as a fair judge, 
to stop being partial, and adhere to moral and humanitarian 
principles in its international dealing if it is serious in 
truly playing the role of superpower in today's world. 
  The paper emphasizes that a clear vision of the flagrant 
aggression being suffered by the Palestinians will contribute to 
the resumption of the peace process in an atmosphere of trust 
until an agreement recovering the legitimate Palestinian Arab 
rights is reached. Thus, the paper concludes, the hope for a 
fair world order guaranteeing security and stability for all 
states and nations can materialize.

  [Text] Lebanese Forces Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' said in a 
telephone interview with the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper 
that he does not know the reasons behind the tightened measures 
still being taken by units of the Lebanese Army in Ghidras. 
Ja'ja' expressed his willingness to hand over any wanted person 
if investigations prove he had a connection with recent 
explosions. 
  Stating that the state, with all its apparatuses, has not 
requested he hand over anyone, Ja'ja' said: We were surprised 
by these measures, for which I can find no explanation. 
  Ja'ja' revealed that 20 people have been arrested and that a 
100 members of the Lebanese Forces are being treated as suspects 
and are being harassed.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Lebanese Forces' Central Media Apparatus; </F>
date not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Instead of opening this statement by providing the 
public with a political interpretation of the goings on in the 
Lebanese arena, we will only recount the events without comment, 
since these events have political implications that the citizens 
can understand and draw their own conclusions as to the events' 
meanings and import. 
  In this context, we note that the authorities have been 
carrying out a storming and arrest campaign over the past 24 
hours. The campaign encompassed the areas of al-Arz, Sadd 
al-Bawshariyah, Mayruba, 'Amshit, Jubayl, Jadayil, al-Buwar, 
Sinn al-Fil, al-'Uqaybah, Juniyah, Zuq Mikha'il, and others. 
The authorities took the liberty of violating the sanctity of 
homes in a manner deemed impermissible by law, tradition, the 
Constitution, and human rights. 
  The Lebanese Forces would like to note a few things. 
  1. The following persons have been arrested: Sharbil Zena 
Rahmi, Kamil Khalil, Faris Matta, Zuhayr 'Ubayd, Tony Hanna 
Basil, George Nakhlah Khalifah, As'ad 'Ubayd, Joseph Anis Rizq; 
60-year-old Joseph Faddul, chief of the Bsharrah region in the 
Phalangist Salvation Committee, and his sons Tony and Fawzi; 
Sharbil Bulus, Edgar al-Ris, John al-Risa, Isiah 'Utayyiq, Tony 
Jabbur, 'General Jabbur, Tony Jum'ah, Joseph Jum'ah, Jack 
Jum'ah, Sahwqi al-Dakkash, Elie al-Ra'i, Rafiq Tawq, and Louis 
'Abd-al-Satir. They all belong to the Lebanese Forces or the 
Phalangist Salvation Committee. 
  2. Among the stormed homes were the homes of Walid Sulayman, 
Tony Abu-Yunus, Sharbil Abi-'Aql, Wisam Bulus, Romeo 'Awwad, 
John Habib, and Tarabayh Rahmi. 
  3. Despite what is happening, the Lebanese Forces have 
repeated their call to officials to respect the laws and 
Constitution and international traditions. They reiterate their 
confidence that the rule of law and justice must eventually 
prevail no matter how difficult things might be and regardless 
of how citizens are targeted, how much partisan activity is 
restricted, and how democracy and the people's rights are 
violated.

  [Text] As part of the security measures taken by the 
Lebanese Army on the night of 10-11 March 1994 in the various 
Lebanese areas, patrols of the General Directorate of the 
Internal Security Forces and the Public and State Security 
directorates, in coordination with the Army's intelligence 
directorate, staged storming operations to arrest persons wanted 
for crimes and others suspected of spreading rumors and making 
threatening calls. A number of persons were arrested and are 
being interrogated for referral to the judiciary. 
  Today's issue of the London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper cites 
an 
official source as saying that storming operations were not 
exclusive to Kasrawan but covered all the areas, including 
Beirut and its suburbs. The source affirmed that the Lebanese 
security agencies and intelligence apparatus have a complete 
file on various security incidents, including the Sayyidat 
al-Najat [church] explosion. This file gives us clear clues to 
the culprits in these incidents, he said. However, he added, 
clues are not sufficient in a country like Lebanon, because 
there is a difference between evidence that convinces the 
security organs and that which will convince the judiciary. 
  Responding to a question, the official source said that the 
arrest campaigns dealt with more than 13 persons--explosives 
experts and suspects, or people wanted in certain cases 
involving deliberate attempts to mar the atmosphere and spread 
panic among the public. 
  Replying to another question, the official source said that 
the conduct of Lebanese Forces commander Samir Ja'ja' after the 
explosion in the Sayyidat al-Najat church was not a political 
move so much as a security move which he wanted to use to show 
that others were being unjust to him or to forestall the 
security forces from trying to uncover the culprits and thus 
ease the worries of persons connected to him. The investigation 
will entail interrogations of these persons for information the 
investigators need, the source remarked. 
  He added: They leaked the story that the Army had stationed 
soldiers at the entrances to the headquarters of Ja'ja' in 
Ghidras and that the troops had tried to go in one of the 
entrances but had retreated after an argument with the 
headquarters guards. This is not true, the source said, adding: 
The Army does not retreat before the guards of any 
headquarters. The days when headquarters guards could do that 
are over; it is no longer possible for any party to use force to 
prevent the Army from entering any place or to light the fuse on 
a certain front or instigate a battle. The Army is capable of 
settling any military or security situation, he affirmed, 
adding: To put it simply, the Army had no orders to enter this 
particular headquarters. 
  Explaining the reason for the reinforcement of Army troops 
in 
Ghidras, the source said: As part of the storming operations 
that started on Thursday, two of the Lebanese Forces' members 
are wanted for interrogation; their leadership knows this. When 
we demanded that these persons be turned over, they stirred up 
that commotion in order to harm the military institution as part 
of a coordinated campaign that started with the church 
explosion. Some people have grudges against the military 
institution, the source said. 
  He added that some persons in the Lebanese Forces 
headquarters are wanted. Warrants have been issued for some of 
them and some have been sentenced in absentia, including Raji 
'Abduh, who is wanted in connection with the assassination 
attempt against the president of the republic in 1991. Others 
are wanted for interrogation and to testify in the case of the 
church explosion. These people must be turned over, he said. 
Some of these persons played a certain role or have information 
about certain persons, he explained. 
  The official source told AL-HAYAH that the security file the 
authorities are handling, in close coordination, includes 
investigations into the explosion at the Phalangist Party 
central headquarters and other incidents. More important in 
this connection is that the Israeli network that the security 
agencies discovered, some of whose suspected members have been 
referred to the judiciary, has branches in the occupied border 
strip and other areas. One of the major suspects in this 
network has not yet been arrested, but he is known to be in a 
certain area, which we will not reveal. This area is known to 
us and to others, the source said. 
  The source believes that the Lebanese Forces are blowing the 
case out of proportion in order to close the file and reach a 
settlement with the state concerning their wanted members.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] In an interview published in today's issue of 
AL-DIYAR, Lebanese Forces Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' views the 
situation in Ghidras and the recent security measures, arrests, 
and house searches. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' said: The first thing that caught my attention in 
the security developments concerning Ghidras and the 
headquarters of the Lebanese Forces is that a security source 
accused me of cheap public posturing. I would like to ask this 
source, in all cordiality, why is he afraid to identify himself? 
First of all, who is this security source? Secondly, in what 
self-respecting country in the world do security personnel 
dabble into political matters and accuse politicians, ministers, 
and deputies. 
  A security man's job is to gather security information and 
report them to the legal authorities and political officials, 
who may take the necessary action and, if need be, file charges. 
  Today, for example U.S. President Bill Clinton is facing 
accusations. The attorney general, a Washington Court judge, 
the secretary of the interior, and the attorney general are the 
ones who may comment on whether the President of the United 
States is to face charges or not. But things are different 
here. I find it totally unacceptable that a security official 
should make statements or leak news at will. 
  The second remark that I found interesting is the claim that 
the Lebanese authorities are currently examining the possibility 
of liquidating the Lebanese Forces. This is the first time I 
have heard of such a thing. I call on the anonymous individual 
who spread such rumors to identify himself. For example, is he 
the interior minister, who has the legal right to bring up that 
matter, or the defense minister, or the president, or the prime 
minister, or the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies? 
  I, for one, have not heard any official proposing the 
disbanding of the Lebanese Forces. Not one official has even 
come close to expressing such a notion. It is evident that we 
have to live according to the country's laws, but we refuse to 
live according to the law of the jungle. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' was asked: Returning to the security source, we 
would like answers to the accusations the he made, particularly 
the charge that the Lebanese Forces are not interested in 
politics, but are an intelligence service that is still in 
operation. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' answered by saying: If I wanted to respond to 
some of the points made by anonymous security sources -- for 
example, the claim that I do not want to engage in politics -- I 
would ask this: What am I involved in, then? I am specifically 
involved in politics. It is because I am involved in politics 
that they [not further specified] deal with us in the way that 
we have seen of late. According to them, we do not want to 
participate in political life, but indulge in intelligence work. 
This is a serious accusation. 
  The individual making such allegations is not weighing his 
statements carefully. If he has evidence but is still silent, 
then he is remiss in his security duties. If he has no evidence 
and is not sure of what he is saying, he is committing a serious 
offense against political and public freedoms in this country. 
No official is entitled to make random accusations against any 
political party or individual. 
  Ja'ja' added: What I do not understand is why every time an 
incident occurs, accusations are leveled against us. For two 
years or more the authorities have been saying that I detain 
people at will. I still remember the uproar that arose after 
the Israeli attack last July or August in the south. At that 
time, the authorities made large-scale sweeps and searched the 
homes of Lebanese Forces' officials. They just use the Lebanese 
Forces as a whipping boy. 
  Ja'ja' said: If an attack happens in the south, it is the 
Lebanese Forces. If an explosion happens in the American 
University of Beirut, it is the Lebanese Forces. If the 
Phalangist Headquarters is blown up, it is the Lebanese Forces. 
The bombing in Sayyidat al-Najat Church: The Lebanese Forces. 
If a citizen beats up his neighbor in Ba'labakk: The Lebanese 
Forces. All these accusations are groundless. It is clear that 
we are up against a deliberate smear campaign. 
  What I want to say is that they have repeatedly made 
accusations against the Lebanese Forces. They prejudge us and 
then carry out searches and arrests. What good did the arrest 
of thousands of young Lebanese Forces' supporters do after the 
Israeli attack in the south? The pretext for these campaigns -- 
if I remember right -- was that there was another Israeli attack 
on the home front. Did I call for an Israeli attack against the 
south? They claimed to be making preparations to confront 
Israeli attacks? Fine. What have they found out? 
  They have made big accusations, serious accusations. This is 
how we see it. They made serious and untrue accusations against 
us. Had such charges been made against any other individual or 
party in Lebanon, we would have found them unacceptable, 
particularly because they were designed to mislead. Underlying 
these accusations is a scheme to bully the Lebanese Forces. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' said: Some people wonder why all this uproar 
over the Ghidras issue. The state has two stories it is trying 
to propagate. According to a statement issued by the Lebanese 
state, the first story is that the recent security measures are 
part of the general security plan in Lebanon. If this is the 
case, why is the state angry? Is the Army not entitled to set 
up roadblocks on any road? 
  According to the state's second version, there are fugitives 
and wanted people; hence they are confusing things. Officials 
say that there are fugitives, wanted people, explosives experts, 
and suspects, and that all those are in Ghidras. I will respond 
to each claim. 
  As for the first version, Dr. Ja'ja' said: First of all, the 
state cannot just level accusations against anyone, because 
there is a judiciary in Lebanon. As long as there is a 
judiciary system in Lebanon, the current events are 
impermissible. Accordingly, why is the state not naming the 
defendants, listing all the incidents incriminating the 
defendants, and bringing them to trial? As you know, when such 
steps are taken, the families of the defendants will appoint a 
defense lawyer and the state will appoint a public prosecutor. 
This is a procedure applicable throughout the entire world. 
Dr. Ja'ja' said that all that the state has said is absolutely 
impractical and inconclusive. 
  As for the second version, Dr. Ja'ja' answered: All the 
accusations leveled by the state as a pretext for its security 
deployment in Ghidras are, in my opinion, not true. All these 
accusations are aimed at curbing the political activities in 
Ghidras. Some officials say that there are wanted people in 
Ghidras. If, for the sake of argument, we do have wanted people 
here, let the state send the police here. How can a wanted 
person be told that he is wanted? If the state thinks that I 
have wanted people here and if it knows their names, let the 
state send me a list of names. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' added: Nobody has talked to us about this issue. 
I dare say that no official, regardless of his level, had 
talked to me or to any official in the Lebanese Forces about the 
wanted people. Therefore, this issue is not under discussion. 
  In answer to a question of whether Dr. Ja'ja' believes that 
there is both a political authority and a military authority in 
Lebanon, he said: I do not want to get involved in such issues. 
But the responsibility for the approach the state is currently 
taking should be shouldered by the political authority. I 
consider this authority responsible for what is taking place in 
Ghidras. I urge the interior minister, who is responsible for 
internal security, to take charge of this issue. We also demand 
that this minister behave as an interior minister should, 
because he is directly concerned with the issue. The days of 
militias are over and no one is allowed to behave as a 
militiaman. Mirhij must behave as an interior minister. He must 
tell us what is required, or else we have the right to ask him 
about all these measures around Ghidras. 
  In response to a question about the extent of the current 
measures, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I have no idea. But Lebanon will 
not remain without political liberties. I urge the state 
politicians to understand the magnitude of what happened. I 
urge them to resolve it in the best possible way, or else they 
will be held historically responsible for Lebanon's decline. 
  Asked about rumors that Samir Ja'ja' will end up in exile 
abroad, he said: No, this is absolutely not true. Our 
political stand will not change. There is no reason for anyone 
to worry, because the current rumors will backfire on those who 
spread them. They may not care about public opinion, but we do 
care a lot about it. 
  To another question of whether he and Patriarch Sfayr share 
the same stand and whether he expects that pressures will be 
brought to bear on the patriarch, Dr. Ja'ja' said: I hope the 
opposite will occur and that no pressures will be put on him. I 
also hope that all the pressures on us will end as soon as 
possible, because the pressures will destroy Lebanon. Lebanon 
will only be built by every word that is expressed under the 
canopy of freedom.

  [Text] The security authorities continued measures and 
steps that are aimed at establishing security and curbing the 
recent wave of rumors. Security measures were intensified 
around mosques during the past few hours. Army units erected 
roadblocks in several areas of the capital and suburbs as part 
of these measures. 
  Meanwhile, the newspaper AL-DIYAR cites the CENTRAL NEWS 
AGENCY as saying that the arrests constitute a preventive 
security step within the framework of the series of measures 
adopted by the security commanders during their coordination 
meetings following the explosions and assassination incidents as 
well as other security violations. 
  The paper adds that some of the detained persons include 
explosives experts who could shed light on the identity of some 
criminals involved in the recent explosions. AL-DIYAR notes 
that some of the detained had constant contact and consultations 
with Ghidras, and they had also formed security networks in 
previous times. The paper says that the security measures aim 
to halt the state of confusion and curb the waves of rumors that 
preceded and accompanied the explosions.

  [Text] Beirut, March 14 (AFP) -- Unidentified assailants 
hurled a hand grenade at a restaurant in an Armenian 
neighborhood here early Monday causing damage but no casualties, 
police said. 
  But they denied a local radio report that a grenade exploded 
overnight Sunday 200 meters (yards) from the British embassy in 
the residential hills of Rabiyah, overlooking Beirut. 
  A spokesman for the embassy refused to comment on the 
report. 
  The dawn attack targetted the Shahbaz restaurant in Burj 
Hammud, a popular neighborhood in Beirut's Christian northern 
suburbs. Police said the grenade caused slight damage but that 
the restaurant was empty at the time. 
  It was not immediately clear if the attack was politically 
motivated or the result of a personal dispute. 
  A series of bombings in recent weeks has heightened fears of 
a resumption of terror attacks in Lebanon, where Pope John Paul 
II is due to visit in May. 
  Lebanon's Christian community feels it is the target of 
these 
attacks, which the government said were aimed at destabilising 
security in Lebanon. 
  The Lebanese army has stepped up patrols and security checks 
around churches, mosques and schools after a bomb ripped through 
a church during Sunday mass on February 27, killing nine people 
and wounding 55 others. 
  Last week a six-kilogram (13-pound) gift-wrapped bomb was 
defused on the doorstep of the French cultural center in the 
port city of Juniyah, in Lebanon's Christian heartland.

  [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah believes 
that the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion was meant to be a mine 
undercutting the Lebanese people, because what was required was 
to create a limited security threat that would then be turned 
into a political earthquake to divert the attention of the 
people from economic issues to concentrate on security matters. 
  He said violating security harms both Christians and 
Muslims. 
He noted that whoever throws a bomb at a church will also do 
the same to a mosque. Whoever places a bomb near a cultural 
center somewhere will also place it in a cultural center here.

  [Excerpts] Tunis, March 13 (AFP)--PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat will visit Moscow on April 19 at the invitation of 
President Boris Yeltsin, officials said here Sunday [13 March]. 
  Replying to a message from the Russian leader, 'Arafat said 
he accepted Yeltsin's invitation for "detailed" discussions on 
bilateral ties and Russia's contribution to implementing 
Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. 
  The official Palestinian news agency WAFA quoted 'Arafat as 
saying he was confident that Russia, a co-sponsor of the Middle 
East peace process with the United States, would continue to 
work for implementation of the Israeli-PLO autonomy deal "in the 
time scale set by the accord", signed in Washington last 
September. 
  Yeltsin's message was conveyed to 'Arafat on Friday by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  'Arafat praised Yeltsin's "interest" in getting the peace 
talks back on track, and the Russian Government's moves to get a 
UN Security Council resolution adopted "which responds 
effectively to Palestinian demands." [passage omitted] 
  'Arafat thanked the Russian Government for its "important" 
efforts aimed at "preventing an escalation of violence in the 
occupied territories," and said he was "very satisfied with the 
friendly and sincere" PLO-Russian dialogue. 
  Besides Kozyrev, two Russian special envoys have visited PLO 
headquarters in Tunis in the past two weeks in a Russian 
diplomatic offensive to revive the peace talks. 
  The US State Department's Middle East coordinator, Dennis 
Ross, will hold talks with 'Arafat in Tunis on Monday and travel 
to Israel on Tuesday. 
  'Arafat aide Bassam Abu-Sharif said the Ross-Arafat meeting 
would also be attended by a Russian envoy.

  [Text] Tunis, 12 Mar (MENA)--Informed Palestinian sources 
have stated that Washington has postponed for a few days the 
visit to Tunis by Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the Middle 
East peace process, to meet with Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat. The visit was scheduled for today to discuss the 
results of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to 
Tunis and his meeting with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat last night. 
  The visit has been postponed despite the PLO's approval for 
receiving Ross today in accordance with a proposal by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in his message to 'Arafat 
yesterday. Under the proposal, Ross was scheduled to visit Tunis 
and Israel today and tomorrow as part of the ongoing efforts to 
bring the PLO back to the peace talks. 
  The same sources pointed out that perhaps Washington is 
worried about Kozyrev's visit to Tunis and his meeting with 
'Arafat, which were made as part of a unilateral Russian 
initiative without coordination with the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] Following Washington's wariness and doubts about a 
statement by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Tunis on 
'Arafat's readiness to resume negotiations, a telephone 
conversation between Yasir 'Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reaffirmed that the issue is still 
deadlocked. The Palestinian News Agency, WAFA, said that, in 
his telephone contact, Christopher emphasized the importance of 
the peace process and the need to resume the negotiations. WAFA 
adds that while 'Arafat reiterated the PLO commitment to the 
peace process and the negotiations, he also stressed the 
importance of taking measures to protect the Palestinian people 
and their Muslim and Christian holy places, to provide 
international protection, and to take measures against the armed 
settlers who are threatening the peace process with their daily 
crimes. 
  In a commentary, the WAFA political editor said that nothing 
good will result without guarantees for the security of the 
Palestinians. He said the negotiations will become dangerous, 
reckless, and absent of any prospects, as he put it. 
  No Palestinian stand has yet been voiced on the possibility 
of a U.S. veto during a vote on the resolution about the Hebron 
massacre if differences between the two sides persist. However, 
it seems that so far the Palestinian leadership is prepared to 
face this possibility rather than return to negotiations that 
would not serve its dignity or secure a minimum of its demands.

  [Text] Brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], president of 
the state of Palestine and PLO Executive Committee chairman, has 
conferred with his brother President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali at 
the Carthage Palace in Tunis. Brother Abu-'Ammar said the 
meeting addressed the UN Security Council debate on the 
al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre in Hebron. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar, who was speaking after the session, said 
he had briefed the Tunisian president on the contents of the 
message he received from the U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher. He told him that the message pressed home the need 
for keeping the peace process going. Abu-'Ammar reiterated the 
Palestinian position on the need for the Security Council to 
pass a strong resolution that takes into account the question of 
Jerusalem and condemns the attack on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and 
decides on immediate measures to protect our Palestinian people. 
  Brother Abu-'Ammar criticized the council's inability thus 
far to pass a resolution on the appaling massacre at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Cited by the French daily LE FIGARO, he said the council is 
not debating a draft resolution submitted by the Palestinians 
and the Arab and nonaligned group at the United Nations, but one 
proposed by the U.S. Administration itself. The Americans, he 
added, are opposed to any resolution that includes Jerusalem as 
part of the occupied territory, despite the fact that Resolution 
799 on the fourth Geneva Convention states just that. 
  Abu-'Ammar demanded that Israel honor the Declaration of 
Principles agreement which Israel and the PLO signed in 
Washington on 13 September, 1993. 'Arafat said he will give 
Israel until 12 April to implement the Gaza-Jericho First 
Accord. If the Declaration of Priniciples fails to be honestly 
and accurately implemented, I will then have the right to put 
the facts before my people, added Abu-'Ammar. 
  As to why he set the 12 April date, brother Abu-'Ammar 
explained that it is the day fixed by the Declaration of 
Principles for a completion of the Israeli withdrawal. If that 
does not happen this means the Israeli Government has decided 
not to honor agreements it signed. The responsibility then 
shifts to the international community, particularly the U.S. and 
Russian sponsors of the peace process, brother Abu-'Ammar said.

  [Excerpt] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the Washington talks, has said that the U.S. 
hinting that it will veto the UN Security Council resolution on 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque if the PLO does not resume the talks with 
Israel is a reiteration that the United States cannot play a 
role other than that of the adversary. He accused U.S. 
decisionmakers of being more Israeli than the Israelis 
themselves. He said: The U.S. Administration has lost its 
credibility and cannot be a fair broker or a sponsor of the 
peace process. He added: There might be a need to reassess the 
overall peace process by the Palestinian party in particular and 
the Arab parties in general. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, 13 Mar (MENA)--PLO Political Department Chief 
Faruq Qaddumi has said that it is impossible for the 
Palestinians to return to the peace negotiations without a 
Security Council resolution providing for international 
protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied 
territories and without tangible, concrete measures on the 
ground to reassure the Palestinian people. 
  He told the Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH today that the 
United 
States remains an obstacle in the way of such a resolution. 
Washington is asking the PLO to resume negotiations with Israel, 
although it knows that this is impossible without a Security 
Council resolution. 
  Qaddumi accused the current team at the U.S. State 
Department 
of being biased and sympathetic toward Israel and trying to 
extort the Palestinian people, as he put it.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nasir al-Qidwah, PLO </F>
representative at the United Nations, in New York, by Ashraf 
'Abd-al-'Aziz, in Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Mr. Nasir al-Qidwah, good morning 
and welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Al-Qidwah] Good morning to you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The UN Security Council [UNSC] has postponed 
a resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. What are you 
and the Arab and Islamic groups at the United Nations doing now? 
  [Al-Qidwah] As you said, it is regrettable that the Security 
Council, after more than two weeks, has not yet passed a clear 
resolution regarding the massacre of our people in Hebron. This 
was a result of the United States insisting on certain 
positions. For our part, we have insisted on a minimum level of 
justice from the Security Council to deal with the incident and 
future situations. Anyway, we may be on our way to overcoming 
the recent obstacles; and the Council may be able to pass the 
required resolution soon, hopefully today. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] You said the United States has insisted on 
certain positions, and that you insisted on other positions. 
Can you explain this? 
  [Al-Qidwah] There were many points of disagreement with the 
U.S. delegation. For example, we insisted on maintaining the 
normal Security Council position that holy Jerusalem is part of 
the occupied territories. We cannot bargain over this issue, of 
course. The United States regrettably tried to alter this 
position. We also wanted, and still want, the Security Council 
to mandate in no uncertain terms the necessary measures to 
protect the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, 
including an international presence. We have sought a clear 
mechanism to follow up on and guarantee the implementation of 
such measures. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] So the problem is the U.S. demand that 
Jerusalem be excluded from the resolution? 
  [Al-Qidwah] Without doubt, this was one of the biggest 
problems; but as I said, there were disagreements regarding the 
language that should be used regarding other issues: protection 
measures, a follow-up mechanism, and the measures the Israeli 
Government needs to take against the Israeli settlers. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Have you noticed a change in the U.S. 
position on the peace process in general and the PLO in 
particular, especially after the current moves by the Arab group 
at the United Nations? 
  [Al-Qidwah] With the full support and the cooperation of the 
Arab group, we have been very active. I cannot deny that the 
U.S. delegation was always ready to enter into continuous 
negotiations with our delegation. This necessarily means that 
they are ready, at least in principle, to deal seriously with 
the problems raised and the demands we made. But at the same 
time, as I said, there have been many differences, and so far we 
have not been able to resolve all of them. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Has the U.S. bias toward Israel become 
clear? 
  [Al-Qidwah] My impression is that the United States wants 
the 
peace process to be resumed without Israel first implementing 
some procedures as an occupation authority, in view of the 
massacre committed against the Palestinian people. We will try 
to resist this, and without doubt we will reject it. We hope 
that, through the support of our Arab brothers and other groups 
like the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic states, we will be 
able to deal with this and overcome the difficulties. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] The United States has asked for the 
Palestinians' participation in the peace process or the 
resumption of the peace process without any Palestinian 
conditions. How do you interpret this? 
  [Al-Qidwah] This is impossible. We have made it clear that 
we are interested in the peace process, but this process cannot 
be resumed or achieve success until a new reality is established 
on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory -- a reality 
that provides protection and security for the Palestinian people 
there, a reality through which specific steps and measures could 
be taken against the settlers, that could eliminate some of 
these settlements and expedite the negotiations over the final 
status of all the settlements in the occupied territories. This 
new reality alone could be adequate to restore the peace process 
to its normal course. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] My last question: What about the Islamic 
countries' moves in the UN Security Council? 
  [Al-Qidwah] The Islamic countries group has indeed provided 
us with full support in our political moves at the United 
Nations. The Islamic Conference Organization adopted a clear 
statement in this regard. We are currently holding close 
contacts with the Islamic states that are members of the 
Security Council. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] We thank you very much. 
  [Al-Qidwah] You are welcome.

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador in 
Cairo Sa'id Kamal has denied reports on an imminent meeting in 
Washington between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
  In a statement to MENA, Ambassador Kamal said that the 
Palestinian leadership does not favor the idea of holding 
meetings like this before concrete measures are taken to protect 
the Palestinians, in Hebron in particular and in all occupied 
territories in general. 
  He stressed that the PLO refuses to resume the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations until after Israel commits 
itself clearly and unambiguously to protecting the Palestinian 
people under their occupation. It must also agree to the 
presence of an international protection force as stipulated in 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement, disarm the settlers when they are 
outside their settlements, release the Palestinian detainees, 
and discuss the issue of the settlements as a whole as soon as 
the executive agreement on self-government in Gaza and Jericho 
first is signed. 
  The Palestinian ambassador revealed that Palestinian-Israeli 
contacts were held through a third party in the wake of the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre regarding holding meetings in Oslo 
between Palestinian and Israeli officials, but the PLO refused 
to hold such a meeting. 
  On the other hand, informed Palestinian sources in Cairo 
stressed that the wording of the UN Security Council resolution 
on the Hebron massacre, which will be voted on on Monday, will 
determine whether the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations will be 
resumed or not. 
  The sources said that citizens in the occupied territories 
want the international community and especially the Security 
Council to take a clear stand on the Israeli crime and to ensure 
their safety from the Israeli settlers' barbaric actions. They 
noted that the Palestinian people in the occupied territories 
reject a resumption of the negotiations without achieving these 
demands. 
  Observers believe that PLO cannot not make agree to resume 
the negotiations without such a resolution from the Security 
Council, otherwise it would face such popular wrath that it 
might affect its position. 
  The Palestinian sources said that if the Security Council 
issues an appropriate resolution, the negotiations will be 
resumed in Washington at the beginning of next week and this 
will be followed by meetings in Cairo to discuss the 
implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement.

  [Text] Tunis, 11 Mar (MENA)--Press reports published here 
today said that the Palestinian leadership is seriously thinking 
of officially announcing the break-off of negotiations with 
Israel. 
  These reports included a statement by an informed 
Palestinian 
source in Tunis which says that this development in the 
Palestinian stand comes in the wake of the failure of all 
political and diplomatic efforts and moves led by the PLO since 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre at all levels to make Israel 
respond to the Palestinian demands to disarm the settlers in the 
occupied territories and to provide an international presence to 
protect the Palestinians living under the occupation. 
  The Palestinian source added that the Palestinian leadership 
is following with concern the premeditated U.S. prevarication 
aiming to thwart a Security Council resolution on the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, especially in light of the 
insinuations by a number of officials in the U.S. Mission at the 
United Nations on the possibility of delaying the Security 
Council debate on the issue until further notice. 
  This source revealed that the Palestinian leadership has 
received demands from Palestine National Council members and a 
number of national figures in the occupied territories demanding 
the breaking off of negotiations. 
  The Tunisian newspaper AL-SABAH today cited a prominent 
Palestinian source as saying that the Palestinian leadership is 
still continuing diplomatic efforts in an attempt to break the 
deadlock in the negotiations. This source did not rule out the 
possibility that the coming few days could be decisive for 
either speeding up the peace process or closing this file for 
good. 
  The same paper also cites informed Palestinian sources as 
saying that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat refrained from 
following up on the telephone call he received from Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin the day before yesterday lest any 
talk could be construed as a return to the peace negotiations, 
which were halted as a result of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The sources added that 'Arafat explained this position as 
insistence on the official and popular Palestinian stand of 
waiting for a clear resolution from the Security Council that 
condemns the massacre and its perpetrators, sends international 
observers to the occupied territories, demands the disarming of 
the settlers and the removal of the settlements, and ensures 
security. 
  They added that the PLO command also wants to know the 
results of the official Israeli investigation and the identity 
of those responsible for not providing protection for the 
worshipers in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  Regarding the several contacts held recently between the 
Palestinian leadership and Russian envoys, the Palestinian 
source said that Russia now has new and positive stands on the 
issue of peace in the Middle East and these stands stem from the 
restoration of the Russian political leadership's 
self-confidence resulting from defusing the armed conflict 
between Serbia and NATO over Bosnia. The source noted that 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit Tunis in the 
next 48 hours to continue the consultations and efforts on the 
Middle East. It said that Russia supports the Palestinian 
demands and the Palestinian side agrees to the Russian proposal 
to hold a second international conference on the Middle East, 
which will be a new Madrid conference. The source expressed the 
belief that Russia has made a strong and influential return to 
the Middle East on the basis of a new concept of its relations 
with the countries of the region. 
  It said that the PLO will hold meetings at the Executive 
Committee, expanded leadership, and possibly the Central Council 
levels in the next few days to assess the situation.

  [Text] Tunis, 12 Mar (MENA)--Informed Palestinian sources 
have disclosed that intensive contacts are now under way between 
the PLO leaders in Tunis and officials in Cairo, Oslo, 
Washington, and Moscow to prepare a scenario for the PLO's 
return to the peace talks with Israel. 
  Under these arrangements, a Security Council resolution on 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque that will meet the Palestinian minimum 
demands will be issued. This will be followed by a declaration 
from PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat that the PLO is ready to return to 
the negotiations, provided Israel will be committed to 
implementing the clauses of the Security Council resolution with 
guarantees from both the United States and Russia. 
  The second step will be the arrival in Tunis of a 
quadripartite Egyptian-Norwegian-U.S.-Russian delegation. The 
delegation will include Egyptian Foreign Ministry under 
secretary Nabil Fahmi, Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Terry 
Larsen [name as received], U.S. Middle East peace coordinator 
Dennis Ross, and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov. 
They will meet with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, fly to 
Tel Aviv to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, then 
return once again to Tunis to meet with 'Arafat to lay down the 
final formula for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations. Following the meeting, 'Arafat will announce the 
PLO's approval to join the talks to be held in Washington. 
  The Palestinian sources further disclosed that the PLO 
leadership in the past three days has come under enormous 
pressure from various parties, so much so that it was hard for 
'Arafat to catch his breath in between the various calls he 
received from Arab and international quarters. 'Arafat received 
two calls from U.S. Coordinator Dennis Ross and another call 
from U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. According to 
the same sources, these calls centered on the Security Council 
resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The United States 
wants the Palestinians not to insist on adding a special 
paragraph in the resolution referring to East Jerusalem as an 
occupied territory. Faced with the Palestinians' insistence on 
their position, the United States told the PLO that it would 
state reservations about this paragraph or would abstain from 
voting, since the Security Council members will vote on the 
resolution paragraph by paragraph. Washington has told the PLO 
that it does not object to the remaining paragraphs or clauses 
in the draft resolution. 
  The third step envisages a meeting in Washington between 
Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], director of the PLO's Economic 
Department; and Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director 
General to discuss the security measures that need to be taken 
in the occupied territories as well as other issues related to 
the Palestinian police that will take over immediately after the 
withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho. This will 
be followed by a meeting in Washington between Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres and Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, PLO 
Executive Committee member. 
  The fourth and last step under this scenario, as seen by 
observers, will be a summit meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin in 
Washington in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  'Arafat received a message from Christopher yesterday in 
which he proposed a timetable for resuming the self-rule talks 
according to what he termed a package deal under which the PLO 
would announce its return to the negotiations. In return, the 
United States would back a paragraph in the Security Council 
resolution on guaranteeing the protection and safety of 
Palestinians in the occupied territories and abstain from voting 
on a paragraph related to the status of East Jerusalem. 
  Christopher proposed to send U.S. Middle East coordinator 
Dennis Ross and his team to both Tunis and Israel soon to 
consult with 'Arafat and the Israeli officials, provided the two 
sides pledge not to raise any new conditions regarding the 
resumption of talks. Christopher also proposed that the PLO send 
a high-level representative to Washington to meet with Israeli 
representatives to hold negotiations, provided these 
representatives are authorized to negotiate over the security 
matters that surfaced following the Hebron massacre. 
Christopher proposed a meeting between Abu-Mazin and Peres in 
Washington on 18 March to resume the talks and reach an 
agreement on the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles. Such an agreement would be signed by 'Arafat and 
Rabin. 
  In his reply to Christopher, 'Arafat accepted his proposals 
in principle so as to expedite a Security Council resolution and 
reach an understanding between the two sides over measures for 
protecting the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
'Arafat accepted Christopher's invitation to Palestinian 
negotiators to meet with their Israeli counterparts in 
Washington the day after tomorrow, Monday, to endorse the 
understanding that the Palestinians will reach with Ross during 
his forthcoming trip to Tunis. 'Arafat stressed that these 
measures must precede the resumption of the talks, which would 
begin with a meeting between Peres and Abu-Mazin. 'Arafat also 
hoped that the United States would not abstain from voting on 
some clauses of the Security Council resolutions, since this 
would conflict with the policy of the United States, which has 
previously recognized East Jerusalem as part of the occupied 
territories.

  [Text] The negotiations between Israel and the PLO will 
apparently resume on next Monday, 21 March. Palestinian sources 
told our correspondent Moti Amir that this date was proposed to 
Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin by U.S. officials. 
  The sources believe that agreement was reached on this 
issue. 
The talks will resume in Washington and in Paris. The sources 
told our correspondent that the PLO's agreement to renew the 
negotiations was made conditional on the Security Council's 
resolution regarding the Hebron massacre, and was given after 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin promised the Americans that the 
negotiations, as well as Israel's redeployment in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho, would be completed before 14 April.

  [Text] The Palestinians have welcomed the cabinet's 
decision on Kakh and Kahana Hay, but stressed that its test will 
lie in its enforcement on the ground. According to Faysal 
al-Husayni, one of the PLO leaders in the territories, the 
decision is not enough to return the Palestinians to the 
negotiations table. 
  [Begin al-Husayni recording, in English] If it will be 
followed by all of the steps that we were talking about and 
asking for, like evacuating the settlers from the heart of 
al-Khalil [Hebron], from Gaza, I believe this will help starting 
fruitful negotiations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Abu-al-'Izz, Palestinian </F>
ambassador to Algeria, by unidentified correspondent in Algiers 
on 11 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-'Izz] First, we do not want to start from 
zero. It is well known that the Madrid conference was merely a 
general conference in which general speeches were delivered 
determining general outlines for the general policies of all the 
concerned parties, including the Palestinian side and the 
Israeli enemy. 
  The impasse through which the talks are going was caused by 
that massacre which was committed against the Palestinian people 
in the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. Initial investigations proved 
that the Israeli Government, Rabin's government, and the Israeli 
Army were directly or indirectly responsible for overlooking 
[the threat caused by] those settlers, though they were aware of 
a possibility for such a massacre being committed. 
  Thus, the impasse which the talks have reached does not 
require going back to zero, but it is in need of the guarantees 
which the PLO has demanded; security guarantees for the 
Palestinian people. These guarantees can never materialize 
before an international force, in one form or another, becomes 
available to help and protect the Palestinian people. At the 
same time, the occupation forces should perform their duties 
toward the security of the Palestinian people. 
  Matters were moving in a natural way before this massacre. 
There were timetables and measures which would have been taken 
a few days later were it not for the perpetration of this 
massacre. 
  Thus, I am saying that if guarantees to protect the 
Palestinian people were offered to us in Madrid, Washington, 
Cairo, or Taba, we would not be against any meeting, anywhere, 
but it should secure for us such guarantees, on condition that 
we do not go back to the starting point, but to what we have 
reached, i.e. [Israeli] withdrawal should start within days and 
conclude before 13 April, the previously agreed on date during 
the signing ceremony in Washington. 
  [Correspondent] Do we understand that if the Security 
Council 
does not sanction in its meeting today, or tomorrow, a 
resolution regarding your requests, the Palestinians will 
boycott the talks? 
  [Abu-al-'Izz] If the Security Council does not sanction an 
orientation which contains security guarantees for our people, 
it could mean that the Security Council is not really concerned 
with the progress of a genuine and just peace that would achieve 
security and stability for the peoples of the region, including 
the Palestinian people, and the United States bears the 
responsibility for this. As it is clear, the latter is the one 
which actually prevents the Security Council adopting a 
resolution to this effect.

  [Text] Fatah-the Revolutionary Council [FRC], led by 
Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna], has said it will not be dragged into 
a confrontation with Jordan despite the arrest of some of its 
members. The group appealed to King Husayn not to yield to 
pressure by launching a campaign against it. 
  A statement by an official FRC spokesman said: We appeal to 
His Majesty King Husayn and the Jordanian administration to 
fully investigate events and facts and to consider the dangers 
of any compliance with Western pressure, regardless of their 
nature. 
  The FRC statement denied any connection with the killing of 
Jordanian diplomat Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah and said: We were 
surprised that the al-Ma'ayitah case was attributed to our 
movement. The statement added that dozens of leading and 
well-known cadres were arrested in campaigns launched last 
month, but that these arrests will not drag the FRC into 
antagonizing Jordan. 
  The official spokesman added: Proceeding from our movement's 
awareness of the ghastliness of what is afflicting the nation 
today and our awareness of possible future disasters, and in 
order to avoid making mistakes, we would like to emphasize that 
we refuse to be implicated. We also stress our commitment to 
our policy and refer to our endurance of sacrifices, pains, and 
difficulties with strength and nobility. 
  The group denied that anti-government actions were taken by 
those recently arrested. It said most of those who were 
arrested had previously served long prison terms in Jordan 
despite the fact that their activities were conducted with the 
knowledge of the Jordanian authorities.

  [Text] On the occasion of world Jerusalem day, the masses 
of our Palestinian Arab people in al-Sayyidah Zaynab camp, 
southern Damascus, staged a huge procession this morning. 
  The procession was led by a number of general secretaries of 
the Alliance of Palestinian Forces, led by Ahmad Jibril, 
secretary general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC]; Abu-Musa [Sa'id Musa 
Muraghah], Central Committee secretary of the Palestine National 
Liberation Movement [PNLM]-Fatah; Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary 
general of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; Talal Naji, 
assistant secretary general of the PFLP-GC; Abu-Khalid 
al-'Amlah, assistant secretary of PNLM- Fatah; Muhammad 
Abu-Musa, command member of the Islamic Resistance Movement 
Hamas; and Abu-Istayf [not further identified], Central 
Committee member of the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front; and 
other alliance leaders. 
  Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus and an Iranian delegation 
were also in the forefront of the procession. 
  Our correspondent in Damascus said that since the early 
morning hours, the masses of our people gathered in the streets 
of al-Sayyidah Zaynab camp, then headed for al-Sayyidah Zaynab 
tomb where Ahmad Jibril delivered a speech. He said: Today we 
stand here on the occasion of world Jerusalem day--this day 
which Imam Khomeyni, may God have mercy on him, made an 
international day. This was decided immediately after the 
victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Imam Khomeyni said 
Israel is a cancerous growth that should be removed, and 
Jerusalem should have an international day. With this, Imam 
Khomeyni drew a link between Jerusalem day and the blessed month 
of Ramadan, and the last Friday of that month in particular. 
The Islamic conquests and the Muslims' battles against heretics 
were carried out in this blessed month. 
  Ahmad Jibril recalled what Imam Khomeyni said--that Islam 
without Palestine and without Jerusalem is an incomplete Islam, 
and Muslims throughout the world should work for the restoration 
of Jerusalem and Palestine. 
  Jibril added: We meet today on world Jerusalem day at a time 
when the whole of Palestine suffers from massacres and 
repression of children, woman, and the elderly. These Jews, who 
killed prophets and messengers, have never hesitated to commit 
more massacres. You recall, o brothers, the massacre at the 
holy al-Aqsa Mosque and how they kill the worshipers who were 
prostrate before Almighty God. This took place on Friday. Two 
week ago, you heard how the Jews killed or injured hundreds of 
worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque. This also took place on 
Friday. 
  The history of our people in Palestine is full of massacres, 
from Dayr Yasin, Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, Sabra and Shatila, and 
'Uyun Qarah, until the latest massacre. The Zionist leaders 
arrogantly denounced the massacre of al-Ibrahimi Mosque, saying 
that its perpetrator was mad and deranged. We ask terrorist 
Rabin: Who committed the al-Aqsa Mosque and Dayr Yasin 
massacres? Was it not the Zionist army? 
  Jibril went on to say: These lies and tricks do not deceive 
anyone. Today, the capitulationist leadership, which signed an 
agreement with the Zionists and relinquished everything, agreed 
to sell the homeland and the blood of martyrs to the enemies of 
God and humanity. 
  We say to all these defeatists that the Palestinian 
people--their women, youths, and elderly--have not calmed down 
and have not become tired. Haven't they seen the children 
chasing the Zionist soldiers and throwing stones at them? 
Haven't they seen the women taking kitchen knives and stabbing 
the enemy's soldiers before being martyred? Haven't they seen 
how the mujahidin in Palestine fight the enemies of God? We say 
to these people: Do whatever you want, but God's will shall 
prevail. 
  Jibril concluded his speech by addressing Muslims all over 
the world and said: Do not despair of Gods' mercy because God 
told the faithful that they will attain victory. If you aid 
(the cause of) God, He will aid you. [Koranic verse] 
  Mohammad Shari'ti, cultural counselor at the Embassy of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in Damascus, read a statement in which 
he condemned the massacre of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, 
and all the massacres the enemy has committed in Palestine and 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  He hailed the Palestinian people and urged Muslims to 
support 
the Muslims in Palestine and to carry out jihad for the 
restoration of Jerusalem and Palestine.

  [Text] A spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] has stated the following: 
  Since our heroes' operation in the al-Rayhan-al-'Ayshiyah 
area in southern Lebanon last week, an operation which resulted 
in the killing and injury of many agents, the Zionist enemy has 
been trying to lift the morale of its troops and agents through 
lies and fabrication. And it seems that what the enemy has 
broadcast about the killing of two PFLP-GC elements and 
capturing two others is part of the same series of lies and 
deception. We, the PFLP-GC, are interested in exposing the 
Zionist enemy's lies. We have not lost a single martyr in the 
aforementioned operation and none of our strugglers has been 
captured.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Bishqar in Beirut] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian mujahidin launched a major attack on a 
Zionist settlement in northern occupied Palestine today. 
Subsequent extensive clashes between the mujahidin and the 
Zionist forces left a large number of the latter dead or wounded. 
  The Nayif Hawatimah-led Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine [DFLP] issued three successive statements in Beirut 
this afternoon, claiming responsibility for the attack. It 
reported that one of its groups infiltrated occupied Palestinian 
territory via south Lebanon and attacked a Zionist settlement. 
Several hours of fierce fighting with the Zionist occupation 
forces followed, during which the DFLP fighters killed or 
injured a large number of enemy troops. 
  The DFLP statements asserted that one of its fighters, who 
was in charge of maintaining communications from south Lebanon 
with the other group members, was arrested by the UN Interim 
Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL]. The DFLP demanded his immediate 
release. 
  According to earlier reports from south Lebanon, two 
Palestinian martyrs fell during fighting with the occupation 
forces today and a third was captured by the enemy. A fourth 
was arrested by UNIFIL's Norwegian contingent. 
  This afternoon the Zionist occupation forces bombarded and 
raked with heavy machine-gun fire liberated villages in the 
eastern sector of the southern border belt, including Dallafah, 
Qilya, Zummarayya, and Jabal al-Dahr. 
  Meanwhile, the Islamic Resistance addressed a new warning 
this afternoon to the agents serving in Antoine Lahd's militia 
[South Lebanese Army, SLA] that it will punish all of them 
sooner or later. 
  The warning added that the enemy Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin's visit to south Lebanon to reassure the agents and all 
the financial and military assistance given to them will not 
save them from the mujahidin.

  [Text] Damascus, 12 Mar (SANA)--The unified command of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] has 
condemned the U.S. role which is obstructing the Security 
Council's role by preventing it from adopting a resolution 
condemning Israel for the barbaric massacre it perpetrated in 
the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  In a statement issued today, the command said that PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's retreat from demanding international 
protection for the Palestinians, the dismantlement of 
settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and evacuation of 
settlers is a new violation of the Palestinian national 
consensus that negotiations with Israel should be stopped. 
  In its statement, the command said that it renews its call 
for 'Arafat's resignation as a necessary step to learn lessons 
from the Israeli massacre and to maintain Palestinians' national 
rights.

  [Text] 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, PLO Executive Committee 
member and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] 
Political Bureau member, has denied the rumor that tried to link 
the movie theater bombings [in Jordan] to the search of PFLP 
Secretary General George Habash's car, in which, the rumor 
alleges, weapons and silences were found. 
  In a statement to SHIHAN, Malluh said such rumors seek to 
harm Palestinian-Jordanian relations and to revive the past. 
Malluh said that tendentious parties are trying to link the 
bombings to the Palestinian factions in general to cast doubts 
on Palestinian-Jordanian relations, which are now being 
established on strong foundations. 
  He said Dr. Habash came to Jordan on 23 February on a 
private 
visit and was not searched. He was treated with all the respect 
befitting a pan-Arab struggler, Malluh added.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz outside the </F>
Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir emerged 
from the building a few minutes ago and announced that Kakh and 
Kahana Hay have been declared terror organizations on par with 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], to cite just one example. 
Let us hear Ben-Ya'ir's explanations: 
  [Begin Ben-Ya'ir recording] The government hereby declares 
that the following groups are terrorist organizations: 
  1. The Kakh movement, whose key activists today are: Barukh 
Marzel, No'am Federman, and Tiran Polack. 
  2. The Kahana Hay movement, whose key activists today are: 
Binyamin Kahana, David Axelrod, and Yequti'el Ben-Ya'aqov. 
  This decree applies to the aforementioned terrorist 
organizations, as well as to any group of people acting to 
attain the same kind of goals which the aforementioned 
organizations acted to attain and with means similar to those 
used by the aforementioned organizations, even if they are 
called by other names or monikers either on a permanent or a 
temporary basis. This decree will also apply to splinter groups 
or combinations of the aforementioned organizations. [end 
recording] [passage omitted] 
  The cabinet decided to outlaw these movements after 
examining 
various pieces evidence. In view of the fact that this decision 
curtails basic democratic liberties, such as the freedom of 
association and freedom of movement, the attorney general 
reiterated several times that the cabinet is in possession of 
evidence with regard to the dangers posed by these movements. 
[passage omitted] 
  The meaning of the decision is that anybody supporting these 
terrorist organizations, either verbally or financially, will be 
liable for imprisonment and that the property of these 
organizations may be confiscated. The attorney general went on 
to say that the police commissioner is entitled to order the 
closing of places where activists of these organizations 
assemble. The decision is based on Article 8 of the Antiterror 
Act. 
  As said a few minutes ago, the cabinet has decided that the 
Kakh and Kahana Hay movements are terrorist organizations 
according to all the legal definitions of the nature of a 
terrorist organization and are as of this moment declared 
illegal.

  [Text] Due to the spate of reports pertaining to the IDF's 
[Israel Defense Forces] rules of engagement in the territories 
and in the wake of the Hebron massacre, the cabinet today 
adopted a resolution reiterating the Israeli Government's 
responsibility, through the IDF and the police, for the security 
of all the residents of the territories, both Jews and Arabs. 
  The cabinet reiterated its commitment to provide maximum 
security for all the residents of the territories. The 
resolution stated that the IDF and the security forces had been 
instructed to exhaust all legal and security measures in order 
to fulfill this goal. 
  The cabinet's resolution stipulated that the Palestinian 
police would be responsible for the security of Palestinian 
residents in the areas it was deployed in. Until the 
Palestinian police was established, Israel would take all 
necessary measures to prevent any security vacuum.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that the decision 
to outlaw the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements was designed to 
prevent the use of violence as a means to achieve political 
goals. The prime minister stressed that the decision was based 
on a legal statement of opinion submitted by the attorney 
general and backed by reports from the Shin Bet and the police. 
When asked whether the cabinet's decision would be upheld by 
the High Court of Justice, Mr. Rabin said he assumed that the 
attorney general and the Justice Ministry had ascertained that 
these steps were legal. Our correspondent Ya'el Ayalon reports 
that the prime minister was speaking at a memorial ceremony for 
deceased Israeli presidents and prime ministers. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that movements which 
promulgated violence should be outlawed. Netanyahu, however, 
added that there should be legal restrictions limiting the term 
of such steps to six months in order to examine their 
effectiveness. 
  NRP [National Religious Party] leader Zvulun Hammer said 
that 
the path chosen by the Kahana activists was wrong, asserting 
that anyone inciting to murder, racism, or the undermining of 
democracy should be punished. However, Hammer noted, it would 
be better if such steps were taken by the courts and not by a 
government with political leanings. 
  Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan criticized the decision saying 
that only people who violate the law should be dealt with 
legally. 
  Labor party secretary Nisim Zvili said that one should not 
judge the entire settler community on the basis of activities 
carried out by the extremist movements in the territories. Now 
more than ever, Zvili said, it was time to establish a dialogue 
with the settlers so as not to turn them into enemies of peace.

  [Excerpts] As of noon today, the Kakh and Kahana Hay 
movements were declared terror organizations according to the 
Antiterror Act. According to the government's declaration, 
support for these movements, activity within them, and even 
solidarity with them, are offenses which entail a prison 
penalty. This is what Attorney General Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir said 
at the end of the meeting: 
  [Begin Ben-Ya'ir recording] [passage omitted] The 
government has decided that due to the danger involved in the 
activity of members of these organizations, there is no choice 
now but to infringe on the basic democratic liberties of people 
who belong in or are associated with, or identify with, these 
movements, and to decide on declaring these organizations as 
terroristic ones. 
  Membership in an organization which has been declared 
terroristic; playing a role in such an organization; extending 
verbal, practical, or financial support to such an organization; 
or expressing solidarity with it, will all be considered an 
offense which entails an imprisonment penalty. The above is 
according to Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Antiterror Act. The 
property of the organizations can be confiscated by the state, 
according to Article 5 of this Act. According to Article 6 of 
this Antiterror Act, Israel Police's inspector general can 
decide on the closure of places which serve terrorist 
organizations or their members as a place of storage or as a 
basis of activity, meeting, or propaganda, be it regularly or on 
occasion. 
  The government gave due consideration to the significance of 
its decision from the viewpoint of infringing on or curtailing 
basic democratic liberties such as the freedom of association, 
the freedom of movement, and others, but viewed itself compelled 
to adopt this decision because of the activity of these 
movements and their members. [end recording] 
  The cabinet ministers adopted Ben-Ya'ir's recommendation 
unanimously, but stressed nevertheless, that the decision was 
not easy. The ministers demand that the decision be enforced, 
and that the radical settlers be disarmed and removed from 
places of friction in the territories. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal reports from the Prime Minister's Office: 
  This evening or tomorrow the attorney general will relay 
clear operational guidelines to the Shin Bet and the police, 
according to the government's declaration on Kakh and Kahana Hay 
as terror organizations. Imprisonment is the sentence facing 
every member of these organizations, as well as any person who 
supports them verbally, practically, or financially. Justice 
Minister David Liba'i clarifies that the decision will not 
enable the members of Kakh and Kahana Hay to play games with the 
police and act under a different name. [passage omitted] 
  The ministers demand a rapid implementation of the decision 
now. Minister Yosi Sarid demands that special mechanisms be 
established in the Shin Bet, the Justice Ministry, and the 
police, with their sole duty being that of monitoring the 
implementation of the decision. Ministers Rubinstein and Tzur 
demand that the radical settlers be disarmed right away, removed 
from the territories, and banned from military reserves service. 
This is first and foremost a moral decision, the cabinet 
ministers said. This is an extreme move which was difficult for 
me to vote on, said Minister Moshe Shahal, while Minister 
Shetrit explained that the cabinet's action was one of no 
choice. [passage omitted] 
  The cabinet meeting ended only about 30 minutes ago, and 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will leave tomorrow, carrying a 
drastic government decision, declaring Kakh and Kahana Hay 
terrorist organizations. 
  [Later on in the IDF evening newsreel, Police Minister Moshe 
Shahal says that the Israel Police has information about 
"several hundred up to a few thousand" people. Still, 
everything depends on the guidelines the police receive from the 
attorney general, and a decision on action will be made 
according to collected evidence; those who committed "concrete 
offenses" and against whom there is sufficient evidence will be 
brought to trial.]

  [Text] The commanders of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
Central and Southern Commands today signed an order empowering 
them to define any group employing violence and threats as a 
terrorist organization. This expands the authority of the two 
major generals responsible for the areas where most of the Kakh 
and Kahana Hay members reside. 
  Up until now, the Antiterror Act could only be enforced 
inside the Green Line and had no legal validity in the 
territories. If the IDF commanders make use of their new 
powers, it will be possible to take measures against those 
organizations that are defined as terrorist in nature, their 
members, and their property, with all the attendant 
ramifications.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our political correspondent 
Shlomo Raz reports that the cabinet decision to outlaw Kakh and 
Kahana Hay was passed unanimously. Minister Ya'ir Tzaban was of 
the opinion that the definition of terror should also be applied 
to Rabbi Moshe Levinger, but he was told that such a decision 
would not withstand an appeal to the High Court of Justice. 
During the session, the cabinet examined documents presented by 
Shin Bet officials about suspicions connecting the two terrorist 
organizations to unsolved murder cases in the territories. 
  The issue of firing regulations in the territories also came 
up in the meeting, but the cabinet decided not to discuss the 
issue because it is currently being dealt with by the State 
Commission of Inquiry. 
  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated in the meeting that the 
question of the curfews and closures on the territories are 
being constantly revised. The cabinet will hold another session 
this afternoon. 
  Kakh leader Barukh Barzel said that his movement will 
continue to operate from the underground and, if necessary, also 
from jail. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that the police 
have arrested another Kahana Hay activist, a resident of Kfar 
Tapuah, who refused to turn in his weapon.

  [Text] The Kakh movement has announced that it will submit 
an appeal to the High Court of Justice against the decision to 
declare it a terrorist organization. The organization said that 
it would temporarily suspend its activity pending the High 
Court's ruling. 
  Our correspondent Gil Litman reports that in its 
announcement, the Kakh movement asserted that all its activity 
had been carried out within the framework of the law. 
  Justice Minister David Liba'i said that the Justice Ministry 
was currently preparing an amendment to the Antiterror Act 
according to which the judiciary, and not the Israeli 
Government, would be made responsible for declaring which groups 
constituted terrorist organizations. 
  Here are some reactions to the cabinet's decision to declare 
the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements terrorist organizations: PLO 
official Abu-al-'Ala' said that although this constituted a 
positive step, it was too little in relation to the enormity of 
the Hebron massacre. Likud Knesset Member [MK] Mikha'el Eytan 
said that the decision came too late. Such a decision, he said, 
should already have been made by earlier Likud governments. 
Mikha'el Eytan added that many people had been led astray by 
these movements. 
  The Committee of Arab Local Councils welcomed the decision 
but said that it was not enough. The settlers should be taken 
out of Hebron and those capable of harming the fabric of 
relations between Jews and Arabs should be disarmed. 
  Uri Ari'el, the secretary general of the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, said that 
the decision should have been made by a court and not by the 
executive level.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Incriminating Kahanism"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, on the basis of the Antiterror Act, the 
government declared Kakh and Kahana Hay, two organizations that 
promote Me'ir Kahana's ideology, terrorist organizations. In 
lay terms, this decree "puts them outside the law;" in legal 
terms, it means the government has made membership in any of 
these organizations a criminal act; from the public and 
political point of view, it puts them on a par with Palestinian 
terrorist organizations. 
  No democratic state hastens to outlaw a collective entity. 
Each and every article of the penal code treats people as 
individuals and not as members of an organized body; liberals 
have qualms about acting as oppressors. Kahanists may now argue 
that the Israeli Government has betrayed its own principles. 
After all, existing legislation does not prevent bringing 
members of these outlawed organizations to trial and their being 
treated with utmost severity if the prosecution can prove that 
they broke the law. 
  The penal code does not punish views, but there are 
situations in which even a democratic state must outlaw 
organizations. In 1948, the Provisional Council of State [PCS] 
issued the Antiterror Act in response to the assassination of UN 
mediator Folke Bernadotte. Based on the Law and Administrative 
Ordinance, laws enacted by the PCS were called "acts" to 
highlight the fact that the legislative body was a provisional 
entity created in the aftermath of a revolutionary feat (the 
declaration of the state upon the conclusion of the British 
mandate). The PCS decided to create the legal tools with which 
it hoped to get rid of the Stern Gang, from whose ranks the 
assassin came, because it was feared that the group would 
generate more assassins whose crimes might have seriously harmed 
the state. 
  The government's actions yesterday followed the line of the 
1948 events. Barukh Goldstein was a Kahanist. So, who is to 
tell that other assassins will not emerge from the same 
environment? Hence, qualms notwithstanding, preventing any type 
of organized activities by people who might infer practical 
conclusions from their political views (similar to the 
conclusion reached by the assassin at the Cave of the 
Patriarchs) is right. 
  One of these people, Barukh Marzel, has already announced 
that he and his friends will go underground and continue doing 
as they please. There is no certainty that the security forces 
will succeed in preventing other manifestations of anti-Arab 
violence, which could be perpetrated by people who have never 
been members of any Kahanist organization. 
  Even if the effectiveness of outlawing Kakh and Kahana Hay 
is 
doubtful, one cannot dismiss the value of the warning issued by 
the government yesterday. In his address to the Knesset, 
Yitzhaq Rabin drew a distinction between Barukh Goldstein and 
his supporters and the Jewish public at large. The outlawing of 
these organizations is meant to warn people against joining or 
supporting them, as the government trusts the psychological 
impact of its decision. 
  Nevertheless, it would be wrong for Rabin and other cabinet 
ministers to think that they completed their job with this 
anti-Kahanist move. In addition, they must remove the Jews from 
Hebron, and they cannot make do with relocating them to Qiryat 
Arba'. The massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs also tainted 
Gush Emunim and the entire settler community. Ostracizing Kakh 
and Kahana Hay and getting rid of the Jewish presence in Hebron 
are not enough to restart the peace process.

Bar] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Speaking in closed forums in 
recent days, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, for the first time 
since the beginning of the peace negotiations, has been voicing 
a pessimistic forecast about the chances of attaining peace in 
the region. "I have the feeling that the window of opportunity 
for an arrangement between us, the Arabs, and the Palestinians 
is slowly closing," Rabin stated in the course of various 
consultations. 
  The prime minister is extremely worried about the erosion in 
support for an arrangement with Israel among the Palestinians in 
the territories. He is also concerned about Russia's return to 
the region with the aim of taking independent action, not 
coordinated with the United States. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin does not intend to do 
anything about evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron and 
transferring them to Qiryat Arba' or other locations. 
  Rabin believes that such a move would set a dangerous 
precedent that would serve as an incentive for the Palestinian 
terrorist organizations operating against the settlements in the 
territories. 
  Rabin transmitted his position on the matter to U.S. 
Administration sources with whom he spoke over recent days. In 
the prime minister's view, a decision to evacuate the Hebron 
settlers would also lead to the opening of the Israeli-PLO 
agreement, which is contrary to Israel's current interest. 
  A majority was developing in the cabinet last week for 
evacuating the settlers in Hebron, mainly for security reasons. 
  The United States is exerting pressure on Rabin to take a 
series of steps to make it easier for 'Arafat to return to the 
negotiating table following the Hebron massacre. The U.S. 
Administration is pressuring for a withdrawal of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] from Hebron's central bus station. The 
Americans claim that if Rabin cannot evacuate the settlers, then 
he can at least make a gesture to the Arabs in Hebron, and 
evacuate the central bus station area, which the IDF took 
control of several months ago. 
  Rabin has so far also rejected this U.S. request, claiming 
that planned Palestinian retaliation against the Hebron settlers 
is prohibiting any thinning of forces or a withdrawal from the 
bus station. Rabin made it clear to the Americans that he 
cannot and will not do anything beyond what he has already done 
to tighten supervision over the settlers. 
  In talks the prime minister will hold in Washington this 
week, he will also raise the issue of growing military 
cooperation being between Russia and Syria, in the wake of 
recent reports reaching Israel that Russia has renewed contacts 
with Syria, offering it sophisticated military equipment. 
  Rabin is due to inform the cabinet today of steps he intends 
to take to outlaw Kakh and Kahana Hay, based on Attorney General 
Mikha'el Ben-Ya'ir's opinion, presented to the prime minister 
over the weekend. The opinion advocates measures to declare 
them terrorist organizations under the antiterrorism law.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Udi Segal from the </F>
Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv ] 
  [Text] Four hours ago, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev arrived on a lightning visit designed to help Israel and 
the PLO resume negotiations. At this very minute, he is meeting 
with Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, at the 
Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv. Kozyrev has brought a personal 
message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Russian minister has brought no new proposals, contrary 
to anticipation in Israel prompted by his observations in Moscow 
about proposals unacceptable to Israel, such as a second Madrid 
conference and an armed international force in the territories. 
Emerging from his meeting with Peres a short while ago, he 
rejected these proposals. Asked about the second Madrid 
conference concept, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
answered as follows: 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording, in English] What we have to do 
right now is to save the process as it is and finish the first 
stage, that is, Gaza and Jericho negotiations and implementation 
of [word indistinct]. And after that probably we might wish, or 
the parties might wish to consider (?having) not revision, but 
review conference, that is resumption of Madrid, not something 
different from [what] Madrid was. [end recording] 
  [Segal translates above and continues] As soon as his 
meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is over, Kozyrev will 
leave for Tunis where he will meet with PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Reporting on the Kozyrev-Peres meeting, Jerusalem Qol 
Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 11 March adds: "Officials who 
participated in the meeting received the impression that Russia 
and the United States are coordinated with regard to Moscow's 
wish for greater involvement in the political process." 
  [A related report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1400 
GMT on 11 March states: "Speaking after his meeting with Peres, 
the Russian foreign minister said Moscow is in favor of an 
international presence in the territories, but it does not 
insist on an armed presence. 
  ["Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said Israel appreciates 
Russia's part in the attempt to promote negotiations. He noted 
that the ties between the two countries have recently become 
closer."]

  [Excerpt] In a meeting with the Russian foreign minister 
in Tel Aviv today, the prime minister implied that he was 
dissatisfied with Russia's independent involvement in the peace 
process without coordination with the United States. The peace 
process cosponsors -- Russia and the United States -- will do 
well to coordinate their positions, Mr. Rabin told Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  He reiterated the Israeli stand that there is no point in 
reopening signed agreements, and that the PLO should return at 
once to the negotiations with Israel. Our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz notes that the visiting statesman 
called on Israel to make a move that will persuade 'Arafat. 
  The meeting, which was held in the prime minister's Tel Aviv 
office, was also attended by Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of 
the Israeli delegation to the Taba talks, and Shim'on Sheves, 
director general of the Prime Minister's Office. [passage

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
is due to depart for Washington this evening. At the beginning 
of April he will travel to Moscow for political talks with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  Yeltsin sent Rabin a message yesterday with a special 
courier 
in which he invites Rabin for a meeting to discuss the political 
process, as well as issues pertaining to Israeli-Russian 
relations. Rabin accepted the invitation. 
  In recent days, the prime minister has voiced his concern 
about Russia's wish to resume an active role in the region. 
Rabin publicly voiced his displeasure after meeting with the 
Russian foreign minister and his deputy, who recently came to 
Israel in a bid to mediate between it and the PLO. 
  It seems that the Russians were hurt by the way their envoys 
were received in Israel and consequently proceeded to arrange a 
meeting between Rabin and Yeltsin. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Francois Leotard in </F>
Israel: Support the Resumption of the Peace Process"] 
  [Text] Tel Aviv -- France should again play a role in the 
Middle East. This statement by Francois Leotard upon his 
arrival in Tel Aviv, where he will stay until this evening, 
summarizes the purpose of this visit, the first since 1948, by a 
French defense minister to Israel. This statement and wish were 
reiterated as Francois Leotard's leitmotif throughout the day 
yesterday. It was a particularly busy day with two major 
highlights: In the morning, the meeting with Prime Minister and 
Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, and in the afternoon, in the 
Oriental House in Jerusalem, a meeting which lasted nearly one 
hour with a Palestinian delegation led by Faysal al-Husayni, the 
PLO leader of the occupied territories. 
  To Prime Minister Rabin, Mr. Leotard restated, one month 
after [Foreign Affairs Minister] Juppe's visit, France's 
willingness to restore normal relations with Israel. These 
relations should be at least as cordial as those France has with 
most countries, also in this region, and should include 
exchanges in the military sphere -- where prospects are still 
modest for the time being -- and in the industrial sphere, where 
things are likely to move much faster. 
  To the Palestinian delegation, Francois Leotard said how 
deeply the French authorities had regretted the Hebron massacre. 
In his opinion, "the only alternative to violence is not a 
status quo, but negotiations." The defense minister again 
suggested to the Palestinians that France participate, through 
its gendarmerie, in the formation of a Palestinian police force. 
  After these meetings, the minister had the impression that 
history is vacillating at this very moment. It is not 
impossible that the peace process be jeopardized again, with 
easily conceivable consequences for security in the entire 
region. This would be a victory of extremism; it would also be 
a drama for both Mr. Rabin's and Yasir 'Arafat's supporters. 
  It was not the minister's ambition, as he himself declared, 
to "lecture anyone." It was his goal to help the two 
signatories of the Washington accord surmount their common 
plight. During a news conference, Francois Leotard thus 
summarized his thoughts: "France should be able to play a role 
in the restoration of peace, speaking from the heart as well as 
the head."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today said that the 
evacuation of Jewish settlements in the territories would be 
implemented solely as an internal Israeli decision and not as 
part of the negotiations with the PLO. Peres added that due to 
the delay in the negotiations, the withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho could not be expected to take place on 13 
April as planned. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports. 
  [Begin recording] [El'azar] Estonian President Lennart Meri 
and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were holding hands when they 
left the ceremony in which they signed joint economic 
agreements. Peres, however, let go of his guest's hand and, as 
always, commented on the future of the political process. 
  [Peres] We must constantly find ways to reach agreement and 
I hope that we will be successful. 
  [El'azar] A little time, not much, is all Peres is asking 
for. His message for the PLO was that one cannot constantly put 
off the resumption of the negotiations and still expect the 
Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip to take place on 13 
April. In the same breath, Peres explained that any expectation 
of Israel evacuating settlements is unfounded. 
  [Peres] The issue of whether settlements have to be moved or 
not is an Israeli decision, but not part of the negotiations 
with the Palestinians. 
  [El'azar] Peres also commented on the Clinton-Rabin summit 
scheduled for later this week. There is no need to divert the 
focus to the Syrian track, he explained, because Israel is 
prepared to make progress on all three tracks. The foreign 
minister then moved on to discuss Prime Minister Rabin's 
impending meeting with the Pope. 
  [Peres] We have just established relations after 2,000 
years. We now have to discuss the next 2,000 years. 
  [El'azer] Addressing the more mundane aspects of the peace 
negotiations, the Foreign Ministry said that the Israeli 
Government would discuss its next steps after being briefed on 
the results of today's meetings in Tunis. [end recording]

  [Text] An Israeli delegation is leaving for Tunis for 
talks with Yasir 'Arafat and Dennis Ross, the U.S. official 
responsible for the peace negotiations. Ross arrived in the 
Tunisian capital yesterday. The Israeli team is made up of the 
director general of the Foreign Ministry, Uri Savir; General 
'Uzi Dayan of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]; and the prime 
minister's political adviser, Jacques Neriya. 
  The decision to dispatch the delegation to Tunis came in the 
wake of the intensive American efforts to bring about renewal of 
negotiations between Israel and the PLO. 
  Qol Yisra'el's Washington correspondent says also that 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the PLO's Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 
'Abbas] are likely to meet at the end of the week to restart 
talks on the autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. The Washington 
meeting is apparently dependent on the outcome of the contacts 
now under way in Tunis.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by President 'Ali Akbar </F>
Hashemi-Rafsanjani at Tehran University on 11 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] With a mere glance, today one 
can easily grasp that Israel's mode of operation has always been 
to create fear and coercion and to displace people in order to 
settle Jews from all over the world in their place. Israel has 
not changed at all since the early days of its formation. If 
the old colonialist policy had undergone the slightest change 
during the past years, then there would be no need today to 
import into Israel Jews at hefty costs from Russia and the four 
corners of the globe. 
  Clearly then, Israel has not changed at all. It has 
maintained its colonialist identity, because it can hardly be 
anything else, and the loss of such an identity will definitely 
mean the destruction of the state of Israel. After all, Israel 
is a state which is made up of a few million nonindigenous 
people. It spends hefty amounts of money on defense and 
military hardware, and the country itself is situated in a 
narrow strip of land devoid of notable resources. Furthermore, 
it is encircled by its enemies as well as by 4 million refugees 
who once fled that land with the undying intention of returning 
to their homeland. Now how can such a country stand on its own 
two feet? It can survive only when major powers stand behind 
it. But why should the major powers support a particular 
country? Why should the Americans and the British pay money to 
Israel? Because they want to safeguard their interests, and 
they need Israel for that end. 
  Any person with a basic knowledge of the alphabet of 
politics 
and government understands that accepting Israel's existence in 
the region is equal to accepting the colonialists' regional 
interests. Israelis themselves fully understand that they are a 
tool in the hands of the colonialists. However, they have the 
same interests and are in fact a part of the colonialist entity. 
They think that the present situation is the only way for their 
survival. 
  It seems that the present thesis on peace has no meaning at 
all. This is to say that one cannot imagine that a country such 
as Israel with all its peculiarities can exist in a normal way 
among all the other countries who are host to hundreds of 
thousands of refugees, countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, 
Jordan, and others. In the PLO-Israel peace plan no thought has 
been given to the refugees. If the peace plan had contained one 
single clause about the problem of the refugees, then one could 
believe that something fundamental was being done. However, the 
refugee situation remains completely unresolved. 
  Nonetheless, the situation is such that a number of Islamic 
countries are encouraging and supporting the peace plan, while 
at the same time trying to make their nations believe in the 
illusion of peace. One cannot possibly believe that the leaders 
of the Islamic countries do not understand the facts. I 
personally do not believe that these individuals who understand 
everything in this world are incapable of comprehending this 
issue. So why do they do such things? This is something that 
only they can answer. This is in fact nothing but an act of 
suicide. After all, how can one accept an entity which is 
inherently colonialistic, and its whole reason for being is to 
serve the colonialists? How can such a regime live side by side 
our countries in a peaceful manner without threatening our 
interests? How can such a thing be possible? 
  When we speak such truthful words and when we provide such 
crystal-clear analyses, we are accused of being against peace. 
If there had been real peace, then nobody would object to it. 
The point is that we do not consider the present process as 
peace. How can one make peace with someone who enters one's 
house and occupies every room -- from the kitchen to the 
bedrooms and reception rooms -- leaves only the hallways and the 
storage rooms for the host and then calls for peace and peaceful 
coexistence in the house? How can that be possible? 
  This can only be possible if one side is very weak and 
accepts whatever it has been offered. But surely this cannot be 
called peace, and such an arrangement will certainly not need an 
accord. This is the problem with the Palestinians at present. 
So long as the Palestinians think that they can regain some of 
their rights, they will continue their efforts towards that end. 
Consequently there will be no inclination towards peace on any 
side. Moreover, Israel will not be satisfied with its gains. 
If Israel was to be satisfied, then it would not be present in 
Golan and Lebanon. Some people say: Look! Israel gave the 
Sinai back to Egypt. Yes! But at what price? The price was the 
disintegration of Arab unity. Israel might grant the same to 
Syria, but the price will also be the same. This is to say that 
by returning Golan to Syria, it will get rid of that country as 
a noteworthy force, like it did with Egypt. Then in the near 
future, there will be no one to resist Israel, especially in the 
light of what has happened to Iraq -- due to the ignorance and 
foolishness of its leaders -- depriving the Arab world of any 
party which Israel can fear. All in all, one certainly cannot 
term the present process as peace. 
  The methods, also, are the same. Of course we can also 
assess some positive issues there which have occurred, but 
unfortunately the Third World fails to make proper use of them. 
[passage omitted] 
  Israel's mode of operation has put paid to much of the 
claims of the colonialists and the arrogant ones. All their 
claims have been flouted without exception. Well if they want 
to publicize human rights, where can a more severe violation of 
human rights be found outside the Palestinian occupied 
territories? Scenes that reach the media in a retouched form! 
Would the world approach such scenes in the same way had they 
happened in places like Iran or other states? It is obvious 
that those scenes is under their own supervision and they cast a 
favorable eye on them. 
  Weapons of mass destruction are the weapons of Westerners. 
Any country which seeks to provide itself with defensive or 
offensive power, they exert pressure: nuclear and chemical 
weapons. Israel has produced them all! It has nuclear arms as 
well as chemical and biological ones. They know all that. It 
has produced them with their [not further specified] money, not 
its own money. 
  Well, I have no clue as to what the slumbering Western 
world, 
their thinkers -- themselves -- think. How can they bear seeing 
their own ugly image in the mirror? On the one hand they are 
interfering in other countries for that reason and on the other 
their own puppet is producing nuclear weapons, chemical and 
biological weapons. And they announce that as well! Officially 
acknowledge that! The law throughout the world is that the 
occupier must ensure the security of the areas under his 
occupation. He has the responsibility. How well does Israel 
protect the people of that region? How can this massacre be 
justified? Those areas are called the occupied territories. You 
can see that there are still serious problems between Russia and 
Japan over a few islands -- and this after all the time that has 
passed and the formal occupations. How can so much occupied 
territory be under the control of a small country? So many 
resolutions.... [pauses] The Security Council, the UN and the 
international community have all expressed condemnation, and 
Israel does not raise an eyebrow! And its friends don't say a 
word either. Can this occur in Iran? Did this happen to Iraq, 
which did what it did to Kuwait? They brought in armies and 
drove Iraq out of Kuwait. Why doesn't this happen to Israel? 
[passage omitted] 
  Is Israel really going to remain? I want to devote the last 
chapter of my talk to this issue. In my opinion: No, it 
definitely will not remain! [Crowd chants] Thank you very much. 
This entity which is the same as a foreign particle in a living 
body cannot last for long. Of course, it may remain for a 
while, as before. Some programs for the expansion of Israel may 
also be implemented. They may go forward a bit, but it will not 
remain. And in my opinion, the path to salvation is through 
Islam. The thing that can be effective, the thing that can keep 
the people on the scene, the thing that can prolong this long 
and dangerous jihad is this very same Islam. All other 
ideologies -- patriotism, linguism [zaban dusti], cultural or 
geographical nationalism -- their legs go wobbly along the path 
when they meet difficulties -- and we have seen examples of this 
in many places. The thing that one is prepared to live for, to 
die for, to tolerate torture for, to suffer hunger and 
homelessness for, and remain steadfast, is this religious and 
Islamic spirit, and we have experienced this in Iran. Our 
experience is a very good experience. We have experienced this 
in our prisons during the shah's rule. We entered the prisons 
together with the Marxists. In those very first days of 
interrogation, the Marxists gave up and the Muslims remained. 
[passage omitted] 
  Of course, Palestine alone cannot destroy Israel. We should 
not expect the people of Palestine to defeat Israel on their 
own. This is an idealistic imagination and a bit like wishing 
for a miracle. We don't have such miracles. Islamic support 
must be offered by all the world. The problem of Algeria should 
be resolved, the problem of Egypt should be resolved, the 
problem of Iraq should be resolved. The peoples of these 
countries should be frank and sincere, as are the people of 
Iran. They should be not be scared. The Americans and the 
British should be made to make a calculation and decide to 
either lose all the world of Islam or lose Israel. When that 
day comes... [pauses] We have the way for the victory of the 
Palestinians, and it is not an impossible path to take. Of 
course, it is a tempestuous sea, a dangerous desert, the path is 
very dangerous. [passage omitted] 
  Those who think that following the signing of a peace treaty 
the Muslims will stop are wrong. I believe that this might be a 
positive development. Let the governments sign peace treaties 
and let their peoples understand that their path is different 
from those governments. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Second 'Id al-Fitr prayer sermon by Ayatollah 'Ali </F>
Khamene'i, leader of the Islamic revolution, in Tehran on 13 
March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] 
  These days, in the political arena of the governments and 
powers of the world on the one hand, and the mass upon mass of 
the people of nations on the other, there exist beautiful things 
as well ugly ones. The awakening of the nations is a beautiful 
thing; the leaning toward Islam by the Muslim nations is a 
beautiful thing; the nontolerance of tyranny by the innocent 
ones is a beautiful thing. The ugly things are the tyranny of 
the tyrants, the bullying of the bullies, and the plotting, 
evil-heartedness, and malevolence toward nations. 
  Among the undesirable and ugly points in the world arena, in 
my view, there is one that is most ugly. Today I wish to 
emphasize that point so that the view of the Iranian nation 
becomes clear for all to see. The point is that we do not 
expect the bullies and thugs of the world to be good and not to 
behave like tyrants. We do, however, expect fairness and 
independence from the forums of the world. The United Nations 
is so called because it is a place which belongs to nations. It 
does not belong to governments, let alone to certain bullying, 
greedy governments of the world. Unfortunately the reality is 
something else today, and that is the very ugly point. 
  Of course we had already seen how the Security Council acts 
-- the Security Council which is the principal decisionmaking 
body and the heart of the United Nations. We had realized how 
much that organization was in the hands of the superpowers in 
crucial moments, becoming theirs, rather than belonging to the 
nations. That was during the imposed war. When the imposed war 
came and Iraq violated our borders and entered several of our 
country's provinces we took our protest to the United Nations, 
as is usual. As usual, the Security Council should have issued 
a resolution condemning Iraq as the aggressor. It failed to do 
so. I waited several days. The Iraqi Army, taking advantage of 
our unsettled situation at that time, settled itself on our 
beloved country's soil, our beloved Islamic Iran -- it seized 
several thousand kilometers -- and then, and only then did the 
Security Council lift its head to utter a word. It issued a 
resolution. What was the resolution? Did it say that the 
aggressor must leave Iranian soil? Not at all. It issued a 
resolution to the effect that Iran and Iraq should declare a 
cease-fire. What does that mean? It means that the Iraqi Army 
has entered Iranian soil and now that it is the Iranian nation's 
turn for a heroic defense its hands must be tied; no one is to 
defend the country and the Iraqis should not be thrown out. 
That was the Security Council's resolution! 
  You know that for several years they said the same thing 
without condemning the aggressor. Of course our combatants, in 
not too long a period, within almost one and a half years, took 
back most of the land themselves. That was the precedent for us 
then. 
  A few years later Iraq's invasion of Kuwait took place. 
When Iraq invaded Kuwait there was no oppressed nation involved 
there: it was a question of the interests of America and the 
superpowers. You all saw how a first resolution was issued in a 
matter of hours, saying Iraq must get out of Kuwait. For years 
we had asked the Security Council to issue such a resolution 
against [as heard] us in the imposed war, but it would not do 
so. But within hours it issued that resolution on Kuwait. 
  Then the Security Council issued several resolutions, one 
immediately following the other, permitting the Americans to 
enter the Persian Gulf, wreck Iraq, and do what they liked. The 
Security Council resolutions on the Kuwaiti war are still in 
effect and still being implemented. We have seen that. 
  In recent months -- once in the case of Bosnia -- the 
Security Council should have been fair; we saw that it was not. 
Another time was in the case of the holy shrine of Abraham in 
occupied Palestine. The Muslim nations said they were prepared 
to send soldiers as UN troops, as a buffer between the Serbs and 
Bosnian Muslims. The Security Council said Muslims cannot go, 
because they are Muslims and may support one side. Of course, 
it was a wrong thing to say. The Muslims were going to mediate 
and act as a buffer, not to fight. Anyway, they said that, but 
at the same time they allowed Russian soldiers, who are 
obviously on friendly terms with the Serbs, to go as UN troops 
and act as a buffer. 
  What happened? Why did they not consider that the Russian 
soldiers are connected to the Serbs from a standpoint of 
religion and other ties? The world's magazines printed 
photographs of Russian tanks bearing the UN insignia entering 
the region, while the Serbs were shouting slogans, cheering, and 
clapping for them. That was one case. 
  Bosnian Muslims are still being sacrificed; the United 
Nations does not care a bit and the Security Council does not do 
its duty. 
  The second issue concerns this bloody tragedy at the shrine 
of Abraham. Israel should have been categorically condemned. 
It should have been punished, it should have been put on trial, 
it should have been forced to accept punishment. The United 
Nations should have done this, but it did not. The Security 
Council has not taken on its responsibility at all. What is the 
reason for this? The reason is the influence of big powers, led 
by America, in the Security Council and their influence on the 
secretary general himself. Let them know that this is the view 
of the Islamic Republic and the people of Iran. The secretary 
general himself....[pauses; crowd chants "God is great," 
"Khamene'i is the leader," "Death to those who oppose the 
supreme jurisconsult," "Death to America," "Death to Israel"] 
  We do not have a particular enmity toward anyone. We respect 
world figures based on their dignity and position. The former 
UN secretary general came to Iran time after time. At that 
time, the president, the Majles speaker, and Foreign Ministry 
officials all welcomed and respected him. If the secretary 
general carries out his duties, we will respect him. However, 
in our opinion, and in the opinion of the Iranian people, this 
present secretary general has not carried out his duties. 
  The future of these Iranian people is bright. The power of 
these people will increase day by day. The roots of these 
people will go deeper; their word will be more widely accepted 
in the world. Today you can see that this is true. Compared to 
10 years ago, we are stronger today, we have more honor in the 
world. The people are more forthright, brave, and ready to 
follow the great path to the lofty aim, because of the blessings 
of Islam and the Koran. 
  I have one more point to raise at the end of my talk. 
Unfortunately, the issue of the hajj has not followed its proper 
course so far this year. The Saudi Government is placing 
obstacles in the way. And I do not know why. The Foreign 
Ministry, the Hajj Organization, the representative of the 
leader, the leader's mosque in Medina have made great efforts. 
Most of the work of the hajj should have ended by now, by the 
end of Ramadan. The Saudis are causing problems. 
  I don't know why they are doing this. Of course, we are 
assuming the best. We hope the Saudi authorities, God forbid, 
will not do anything to incur the wrath of the Iranian people. 
We hope they will not do anything to make the Muslims of the 
world feel that the hajj is another tool in the hands of America 
and the big powers. This must not occur, and we hope it will not. 
  I hereby announce: Hajj is the right of Muslims. The house 
of God belongs to Muslims. [passage omitted] The house of God 
does not belong to anyone in particular. If anyone has the 
honor to manage the house of God, he should thank God and 
provide facilities for the peoples to make their trip to Mecca 
and not place obstacles in their path. These great and faithful 
people, with the interest and enthusiasm that they have to visit 
the house of God, the pure grave of the great prophet, and the 
graves of the great imams [a'emmeh-ye baqih], peace be upon 
them, deserve to be placed at the head of the queue of other 
peoples in order to perform the hajj and visit the house of God. 
  We ask God....[pauses] The hajj issue is an Islamic issue; 
it should remain Islamic. It should not be sacrificed for the 
international political games of arrogance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign Affairs 
Ministry issued a statement today describing the action taken by 
the UN Human Rights Commission as irresponsible and strongly 
condemned it. 
  In a vote, the UN Human Rights Commission, despite the fact 
that the majority of its members voted against or abstained, 
approved a resolution on the violation of human rights in Iran, 
supported only by Western countries. 
  The statement by the Islamic Republic of Iran's Foreign 
Affairs Ministry stresses: Those who issued the resolution have 
remained silent in the face of the Zionist regime's crimes at 
the al-Khalil mosque and have even stopped, in the first round 
of its debate, a resolution that would have condemned the 
Zionist regime. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry statement also mentions: It has 
been proved to the world that the Western countries who support 
such resolutions, are themselves practically assisting the 
anti-human crimes and the clear violation of human rights in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the heart of Europe, through their 
deception. 
  The statement by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran emphasizes that the Iranian punishment laws are 
based on the Islamic legal concepts, accepted and respected by 
over 1 billion world Muslims, and such resolutions not only have 
no credibility or legitimacy, but will also damage the 
credibility of such forums.

  [Text] With the dispatch of 1,153 air and ground patrol 
units, the security forces have started the implementation of a 
special scheme for the period of Nowruz [Persian new year 
celebrations, starting 21 March]. 
  At a news conference today, Brigadier General Seyfollahi, 
the 
security forces commander, also announced: During the Nowruz 
period, the security forces' patrol units will be dispatched to 
their designated areas, according to a prearranged plan. He 
then set out to describe the security forces' activities during 
1372 [year ending 20 March 1994] and said: During this year, by 
closing the country's eastern borders, the security forces 
succeeded in discovering 90 tonnes of narcotics of various 
types. Furthermore, in this connection 459 leaders of gangs 
involved in narcotics distribution were arrested. 
  The security forces commander added: During the past year, 
security forces personnel were also able to confiscate 10,000 
firearms which had been brought into the country illegally. 
Moreover, during 1372, 51,000 antique objects of various kinds 
were recovered from several gangs who had intended to take them 
out of the country. 
  He said: The security forces have been very active in the 
four border provinces of the country, fighting the import of 
contraband goods and succeeding in doubling the volume of its 
confiscations in comparison with last year. 
  The security forces commander also said: Legal proceedings 
will be taken against individuals who produce and distribute 
fireworks.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran has signed two credit 
agreements with Germany and Japan to pay off more than 50 
percent of its postponed credits [e'tebarat-e ta'khir shodeh]. 
  In a radio and television interview this morning, Mr. Adeli, 
the governor of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Central Bank, 
announced: Following negotiations with the representatives of 
some Japanese companies, an agreement was signed in the early 
hours of this morning, Tehran time, between an Iranian 
delegation from the Central Bank and representatives of the 
Japanese companies. He added: This document will provide Iran 
with more than $2 billion in credit to pay Japanese exporters. 
Mr. Adeli said: The credit is for a period of around two years 
and repayment period is three and a half years, which makes a 
total of five and a half years. 
  The Central Bank governor also said: Two weeks ago a similar 
$2.6 billion agreement was signed with Germany, which will help 
our country pay off more than 50 percent of its postponed 
credits. 
  He said the cost of those credits is just over 4 percent per 
year. He stated that Central Bank delegations are currently 
holding talks with other countries to pave the way for 
negotiations. The people will be informed as soon as other 
agreements are signed. Mr. Adeli added: The signing of the 
documents allows Iran to postpone the expiry dates of its 
condensed and short-term credits [e'tebarat] which were not 
repaid in 1992, 1993, and 1994 due to the fall in oil prices. 
  He said: We expect to pay off all our postponed payments to 
exporters of those two countries within the next couple of 
months. Therefore goods which were not dispatched because of 
nonpayment will gradually be sent. 
  The Central Bank governor went on to say: A group of 
importers and production companies used to purchase their 
foreign currency needs in the free market to pay off their 
debts. With the payment of debts to foreign exporters there 
will no longer be any need to do that. He said the signing of 
the agreements will reduce cash purchases and cut foreign 
currency demands in the free market. He added: It is expected 
that some cases of limitation imposed by a number of countries 
on government insurance will resume. He stressed: Obviously 
countries that provide insurance cover to facilitate their trade 
transactions with Tehran will be given a greater share of the 
Iranian market in the future and will be given priority over 
other countries.

  [Text] Tehran, March 14, IRNA -- Saudi Arabia's 
over-production, besides other factors such as the international 
economic recession, is responsible for the continued low oil 
price, said an oil expert here last week. A former high-ranking 
Oil Ministry official who requested anonimity told the bilingual 
weekly 'KAYHAN HAVA'I' that Saudi Arabia was producing about 9.5 
million barrels per day, 1.5 million more than its official OPEC 
quota. 
  "If Saudi Arabia abides by the OPEC agreement and reduces 
its 
oil output, oil prices will jump up", he told the weekly. 
  Brent North Sea crude oil last week crashed to a low of

13.5 a barrel, its lowest level for six years. Oil prices 
further plummeted last week after OPEC members of the (Persian) 
Gulf Cooperation Council ended a meeting without reaching 
agreement to reduce their oil output. "There is no evidence to 
prove that Saudi Arabia will agree to a lower quota in the 
upcoming OPEC meeting", the former Oil Ministry official said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzbeh Bu ol-Hari: "Reasons for U.S. Request </F>
for Talks With Iran"] 
  [Text] Last week, the United States made two requests for 
improved relations with Iran and for talks with our country's 
officials. In view of the policy of erecting barriers against 
Iran as announced by the Bill Clinton Administration, the 
remarks by the high-level U.S. officials are worth pondering 
over for the following reasons: 
  Three views can be presented with regard to Washington's 
latest stance: 
  1. The victory of Russian President Yeltsin's 
opponents--that is, the communists and the nationalists--in the 
Russian parliamentary elections and the daily mounting impact of 
their viewpoints on the domestic and foreign policy making which 
has inspired apprehension in the United States and its allies. 
  Washington is concerned over the possibility of Yeltsin's 
opponents taking over power and the resumption of worldwide 
confrontation, which could endanger its interests. This is why 
in the past months we have witnessed moves by the United States, 
including suggested plans for collaboration for peace and 
extensive activity to prevent the revival of Russian influence 
in these regions. 
  These moves, which are aimed at creating a security belt as 
well as a quarantine around Moscow, encounter a vacuum in only 
one area -- that is, Iran. This is because in the event of any 
anti-Western moves in Russia and the possibility of cooperation 
between the new leaders in Moscow with Tehran, the balance of 
power in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East will shift to the 
detriment of the West, especially since the oil routes in the 
Persian Gulf pass south of Iran. 
  2. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Central, 
and Southern Asia faced a power vacuum. The U.S. relations with 
Pakistan became strained. It does not have any influence in 
this particular region at present, and this situation has made 
its effects felt on other regions. 
  Meanwhile, even though the United States has endeavored to 
implement plans for the breakup of many countries in Asia, this 
is still the beginning. The efforts by the PRC, Iran, and India 
to initiate joint cooperation in the region can endanger U.S. 
interests. Meanwhile Washington is reviewing its frigid 
relations with Pakistan and by supporting it on the Kashmir 
issue it is seeking to fill the power vacuum. However, this 
will not give it much clout over the power triangle of Tehran, 
Beijing and New Delhi. Such a power triangle can shatter 
Washington's goal of domineering on the Asian continent. 
  3. The rising tide of Islamism in the Middle East has 
increased the danger of the downfall of the reactionary regimes, 
and this threatens the interests of the United States and its 
international allies, who are all seeking to serve their own 
interests. In addition, the rising tendency among the 
Palestinians to join groups such as the Hamas in the wake of the 
Hebron massacre could, in the view of the United States, be 
repeated in every part of the Middle East. 
  It is in the above perspective that we can view the renewed 
request on the part of Washington for talks and improved 
relations with Iran. This is an issue which by itself indicates 
the importance of Iran in international relations; and this will 
be enhanced further in the event of any regional or 
international upheaval. 
  Therefore, it is from this vantage point that the United 
States -- taking into account the existing distinctive 
circumstances -- wishes to create conditions necessary for an 
improvement of relations with Iran so that in the future it will 
not encounter dangerous situations on strategic issues. 
  This demands twice as much vigilance on our part so that we 
can utilize our geopolitical [preceding word in English] 
position in our approach to regional and international 
developments and be alert to U.S. ploys.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Chinese leaders have strongly protested against 
extensive Western, especially American, propaganda about the 
human rights situation in China during the visit of American 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Beijing. [passage 
omitted] 
  In line with America's former policies toward China, during 
his four-day visit to that country, Warren Christopher tried 
very hard to make use of the human rights issue in China as a 
means for extracting a number of economic and political 
concessions from Beijing. However, despite America's political 
deceptions on this issue, Christopher failed in his mission to 
China; because Chinese leaders know full well that the claims of 
White Office officials about defending human rights, freedom of 
expression and assembly, and the release of political prisoners, 
are nothing but political ploys. America's silence regarding 
manifest human rights violations by her own allies proves this 
point. [passage omitted] 
  The most important disagreements between Beijing and 
Washington, which started after the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union, have been due to the two countries' different 
perceptions of international developments and the new world 
order favored by America. The two countries' different 
interpretations regarding the new polarization of power in the 
world, as well as the rapid growth in China's commercial exports 
and the expansion of cooperation between Tokyo and Beijing as 
two superior powers in East Asia constitute the roots of 
contradictions of interest between China and America, which have 
assumed more complex dimensions during the past few months. 
  During the past few years, the Asian countries of the 
Pacific 
Ocean rim have enjoyed the fastest economic growth in the world. 
In Washington's eyes those countries constitute a suitable 
market for helping the recovery of America's ailing economy. 
America, which is making every effort in order to gain access 
to that market, is worried about the loss of her market in that 
part of the world and China's excessive influence there. 
  The repetition of the allegations of human rights violations 
in China, even raising the issue of the danger of the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons in that region, are in fact 
parts of Washington's attempts to achieve its goals. 
  By claiming to defend human rights and by exaggerating the 
danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and even by 
increasing her pressures on her allies in the region, such as 
Japan and South Korea, America is trying to justify the 
necessity of her presence in those countries, which have always 
rejected American requests to open their markets to American 
goods. 
  The failure of Christopher's recent visit to Australia and 
Japan has been due to the rejection of American demands by those 
countries. During his visits Christopher did not succeed in 
extracting economic concessions from those two countries, which 
are regarded as being America's allies. 
  In any case, Christopher's failures during his visits to 
Australia, Japan, and subsequently China, demonstrates the fact 
that in the new international scene America is incapable of 
forcing her views upon powerful economic countries, whether 
those countries that are her allies or those that are opposed to 
her.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Mohammad Javad Larijani: "A Big Test"] </F>
  [Text] 1. Everything points to the fact that the massacre 
of worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque was not a spontaneous 
act by a group of "extremists" but the beginning of a series of 
steps that the Zionist Government is pursuing with a special 
objective in mind. To understand this, it is necessary to find 
out what this objective is. 
  2. We should look at the latest U.S.-Israeli actions in the 
region. What has been described as a peace "process" by the 
Arabs only contains the word "peace," and it is pursuing 
specific objectives. 
  The first objective is to extinguish the burning flame of 
the 
intifadah, which has been one of the most dangerous 
political-social phenomena for Israel as well as for the United 
States and even some of the corrupt regimes in the region, and 
is considered to be yet another fruit of the Islamic revival 
process. 
  The second objective is the establishment of full security 
on 
all of Israel's borders. Like the Camp David Accord with Egypt, 
this issue should become the major pivot of all activities and 
should concentrate on a peace accord with Syria and the 
disarmament of the Hizballah. 
  The third objective is Israel's entry into the world of 
Islam, the consolidation of economic relations with the world of 
Islam, and the establishment of a social and political presence 
among the Muslims; and naturally the Zionist regime is more 
enthusiastic about entering the oil-rich Arab countries of the 
Persian Gulf than any other country. The reason for this is not 
the existence of petrodollars, but the absence of a native 
population and of a precise national identity in these 
countries--something that will accelerate and facilitate the 
possibility of Israel's entry there. 
  3. Israel's behavior throughout the talks shows that it is 
pursuing these three objectives. Before thinking about a 
conditional and limited autonomy for the Palestinians, Israel is 
thinking more about extinguishing the flame of the intifadah. 
But despite its unconditional surrender to Yasir 'Arafat, all 
its other arrangements have been upset because the intifadah is 
alive! 
  Israel's overly enthusiastic approach in consolidating its 
relations with the world of Islam and entering its markets is 
not a secret, and in this field--as in other fields--U.S. 
pressures on the Arabs, especially in the Persian Gulf, can be 
seen. But what is the situation like today? In one word, the 
U.S.-Israeli plan has been disgracefully defeated because the 
oppressed people of Palestine demand their rights and are 
extremely alert and experienced in this demand. And moreover, 
Islam is emerging again and the intifadah is the Islamic 
movement of the Palestinian people. Therefore, when the 
Zionists look at a child holding a stone in his hand in the 
streets of Hebron, Jerusalem, or Gaza, they multiply this into 
several million and what they see is a horrific nightmare. At 
no time has resistance against the Zionists been so strong in 
the world of Islam, and this is at a time when Israel is not 
threatened by any Arab army! Therefore, the pivotal policy of 
the Zionists is clear: the only way to preserve the current 
Zionist regime is to extinguish the intifadah. But how? 
  4. In the so-called peace process, Israel tried to fool the 
Palestinians by offering a conditional and limited autonomy. 
But this plot was foiled in its initial stages. Israel then 
chose a second path. It chose to do the same thing that the 
Christians did in Andalusia and what the Serbs are now doing in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. I strongly refuse to use the phrase "racial 
cleansing" because it is an overt insult to human "power of 
speech" since this phrase has nothing to do with either 
"cleansing" or "race." 
  It is actually "barbarianism," which perpetrates a crime in 
the garb of Zionism. The Zionists, who have given up hope of 
persuading the Palestinians, have decided to resort to force to 
wind up matters. They are well aware that if this plan is to 
succeed, it should succeed today because tomorrow will be too 
late. They also know that they have an immense "opinion-making" 
machinery and all of the techniques of this machinery at their 
disposal and are using it in a bid to shape the opinion of the 
simple-minded people in the world. Also, they know that most of 
the Arabic and Islamic governments will be harnessed by the 
United States and that they sincerely want Israel to safeguard 
them from the great wave of Islamic revival, although they may 
pretend that they do not. 
  Therefore, the conclusion that I draw is: 
  First of all, the crime perpetrated at the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque 
was not a solitary and simple act. 
  Second, the Zionist Government's plan is to pursue the 
objectives of the so-called peace process, and this is only the 
beginning of this plan. 
  Third, there is no doubt that the U.S. Government is fully 
aware of this new policy and that the necessary coordination 
with the West's propaganda machinery has been made by the 
Zionists' tentacles in this network. 
  The policy of hypocrisy and persuasion that existed in the 
first method--that is the process of talks--was thwarted by the 
brave Palestinians on their own. But how should the new policy 
of massacres and eradication be thwarted? The world of Islam 
should not remain only on the sidelines, as it has done in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, and merely issue statements. From the 
very beginning, it should impose the legitimacy of its decision, 
irrespective of what the UN Security Council does. Yes, the 
Muslim ummah is facing a big test.

  [Text] Nairobi, March 11 (AFP) -- Somalia's warring 
factions opened talks here Friday [11 March] on the disputed 
southern port city of Kismaayo following fighting there last 
month, a senior United Nations official said. 
  Interim UN special envoy to Somalia Lansana Kouyate said 
factional leader Mohamed Farah Aidid was taking part in the 
UN-sponsored talks with several other warlords including his 
ally Omar Jess. 
  Kismaayo is claimed by Jess and Mohamed Said Hersi, known as 
General Morgan, son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. 
Fighting between their militiamen killed at least nine people in 
the city last month. 
  Kouyate said Morgan was expected in the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi within days to join the talks. 
  "These are informal consultations and I expect them to last 
from five days to a week," Kouyate told AFP. "I am optimistic, 
not only about Kismaayo but about Somalia in general, because I 
detect a new willingness on all sides to make peace." 
  Aidid aides confirmed that "informal talks" were under way. 
But sources close to the warlord said he was still distrustful 
of the UN and would prefer to launch his own initiative to 
restore peace. 
  Kouyate declined to speculate about face-to-face talks 
between Aidid and his arch-enemy self-styled Interim President 
Ali Mahdi Mohamed. 
  Both warlords are currently in Nairobi, staying in different 
luxury hotels in the centre of the Kenyan capital. 
  Ali Mahdi arrived here this week from Cairo where he 
attended 
a meeting of leaders of 12 Somali factions opposed to Aidid. 
  Aidid has strongly condemned plans by the factions to form a 
National Salvation Committee as a first step towards setting up 
a government by the end of this month, when US troops are 
scheduled to complete their pullout from Somalia. 
  Ali Mahdi was not taking part in the Kismaayo talks because 
he has no forces in the city, Kouyate said. 
  Kouyate dismissed predictions that civil war will again 
engulf Somalia after the US withdrawal. 
  "The general situation has improved," he said. 
  "Even the upsurge in banditry is a positive sign, because it 
shows two things. Firstly, the bandits realise that there will 
be less money around after the Americans leave, and secondly 
even they know that the political signals point towards a 
possible settlement, so they are looting while they still can." 
  Aid agencies have borne the brunt of a wave of attacks this 
year presumed to be the work of bandits.

  [Text] New Delhi today renewed its offer to have a dialogue 
with Islamabad at various levels to resolve bilateral 
differences. It has, however, rejected the suggestion for 
allowing any fact-finding team of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] to visit Jammu and Kashmir. The external 
affairs minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, and his deputy Mr. Salman 
Khurshid have expressed the hope that Pakistan will now return 
to bilateral dialogue following its setback in Geneva. Mr. 
Dinesh Singh told reporters that New Delhi is waiting to hear 
from Pakistan about the resumption of the foreign 
secretary-level talks. 
  On the outcome of the UN Human Rights Commission meeting, 
the 
external affairs minister said India has been able to convince 
international community about the false propaganda on alleged 
human rights violations in Kashmir. He said Iran, China, and 
the European Union, besides the United States, had advised 
Pakistan against pressing its resolution. 
  Replying to a question, Mr. Singh regretted Saudi Arabia's 
decision to cosponsor Pakistan's resolution. He made it clear 
that the help of China and Iran at the Geneva meet to India does 
not imply that a new axis is emerging in the region. 
  The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. Khurshid, 
who 
returned from Geneva last night, also denied entering into a 
tripartite deal with Iran and China to enable the withdrawal of 
the Pakistan-sponsored resolution. While ruling out any 
fact-finding mission of the ICO to Kashmir, he said India has 
invited ICO permanent representative in Geneva to visit New 
Delhi for discussions. He said it is wrong on the part of 
Pakistan to say that its resolution has been deferred to the 
next meeting. In fact, the resolution has lapsed, he said. 
Replying to a question, he said the leader of the opposition, 
Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, leading the Indian delegation, sent a 
clear signal that all sides in India speak with one voice on the 
Kashmir issue. 
  Talking to newsmen, Mr. Vajpayee asked the government to 
consolidate the gains of the Geneva meet by taking concrete 
steps to restore normalcy in the Kashmir valley. He brushed 
aside Pakistan's claim that its resolution is yet alive and 
termed it as preposterous. Mr. Vajpayee said for the first 
time, the international community has come to know in full 
detail about the terrorist atrocities in Kashmir. Nongovernment 
agencies of the valley have also ably presented the correct 
picture to the delegates of the Geneva meet, Mr. Vajpayee added. 
  The Congress-I Working Committee has congratulated the prime 
minister on the country's success in thwarting Pakistan's 
resolution on Kashmir in Geneva. The party spokesman, Mr. V.N. 
Gadgil, told newsmen that the Congress-I has decided to launch a 
public awareness campaign on Dunkel proposals to counter the 
opposition propaganda. He said a five-member action committee is 
being set up to revamp its electoral machinery for the 
forthcoming assembly elections. Mr. Gadgil disclosed that the 
next session of the AICC [All India Congress-I Committee] will 
be held in Gujarat. He said the reports of the Karunakaran 
Committee and the Janardhan Committee on last assembly elections 
were discussed in detail.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said that 
after highlighting the Kashmir issue internationally at the UN 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Pakistan will now consider 
presenting a resolution on the issue at the United Nations. 
Talking to a group of foreign correspondents in Islamabad last 
night, she said that as long as India refuses to take 
appropriate steps to make the bilateral talks purposeful, we 
will continue to raise the issue at the global level. She said 
that it is her government that successfully raised the Kashmir 
issue at international forums after the 1940's. I first raised 
the issue at the Islamic Conference Organization in 1990, and it 
was my government again that decided to raise it in Geneva, the 
prime minister said. We made the decision because it was a 
matter of principle, and it was the only means by which we could 
highlight the Kashmir issue at the international level, she 
added. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that the Kashmir issue was raised in 
an unprecedented manner in the past more than three decades. 
India had to agree to allow, though unwillingly, the Amnesty 
International and other human rights groups to visit occupied 
Kashmir. Despite its hesitation, India also had to agree to 
allow the ambassadors of Western and Nonaligned countries to 
visit Kashmir. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that regarding the resolution, India 
had promised us through Iran that it would allow the ambassadors 
of Islamic countries to visit occupied Kashmir. Fourteen 
countries expressed concern over the people of Jammu and Kashmir 
and violation of human rights when the voting on the resolution 
was deferred. The prime minister said that India is now 
reneging on its promises, but we will not let it do that. India 
has lost any sympathy of the people of Jammu and Kashmir because 
Kashmir never remained a part of India. The future of Jammu and 
Kashmir has not yet been decided, and the solution to the issue 
is not to send Indian troops there. The solution lies in 
granting the self-determination rights to the people of Kashmir, 
a goal to which Pakistan is committed. 
  Referring to Pakistan-U.S. relations, the prime minister 
said 
that the two countries are holding bilateral talks on ways to 
resolve all their issues. She said that some U.S. officials 
feel that the Pressler Amendment failed to realize the objective 
of nuclear nonproliferation, and we want the American people 
understand the implications of the amendment. Pakistan has 
displayed patience in this regard, and it should be rewarded for 
that.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 8 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Protest Rallies 
  2. Demonstrations 
  3. Call to Jihad 
  4. Attitudes Toward Israel 
  5. Government Policy and Establishment Media 
  6. Church and State 
  7. Cultural Conflict 
  8. Regime's Downfall Predicted 
<H5>  PROTEST RALLIES </H5>
  AL-SHA'B's 8 March issue continues the paper's broad 
coverage 
of domestic reaction to the al-Ibrahimi massacre, devoting pages 
2-5 to accounts of demonstrations and rallies protesting the 
Hebron shooting and citing speeches by Socialist Labor Party 
leader Ibrahim Shukri, the party's Secretary General 'Adil 
Husayn, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Ahmad al-Malat, 
and lesser figures, all castigating the government's policies 
and Israeli and U.S. "hegemony" plans. This issue carries a 
special banner in the upper left-hand corner reading: "A 
special edition on the Egyptian people's intifadah." The major 
headline is: "The Revolution of the Mosques." Several stories 
and comments deal with the confrontation between police and 
demonstrators at al-Azhar on 4 March. 
  On page 2 an approximately 3,000-word account of two SLP 
rallies in al-Fashn and al-Basatin townships reports party 
leader Ibrahim Shukri's remarks that the Interior Ministry tried 
to ban student demonstrations at the country's top universities 
and refused to allow an SLP-organized march from al-Azhar to the 
mufti's office that would have included major personalities 
following Friday prayers on 4 March. Shukri says: "Let the 
Egyptian authorities know that marches were organized in 
Britain, India, and most of the world's capitals to protest the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The marchers were not harmed but 
in Egypt they were beaten up in al-Tahrir Square, their wounds 
bled, and they were suffocated by police tear gas grenades, 
simply because they dared to show their anger against the 
criminal Zionist murderers." 
  Shukri criticizes the restrictions on opposition press, 
police violence, and rigged elections but tells his audience 
that "the wheel has started to turn and God's victory will come, 
even after a long night." 
  A 600-word report on page 6 is about a conference held 
inside 
al-Azhar Mosque by the leaders of several opposition groups, the 
SLP, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Nasirists, and the Liberal 
Party. The meeting was held to coincide with popular 
demonstrations outside the compound. The conferees urged the 
PLO to reject surrender and withdraw from the "so-called peace" 
conferences. They also urged the Egyptian and other Arab 
governments to release political detainees. 
<H5>  DEMONSTRATIONS </H5>
  A 300-word report on page 2 describes the 4 March Friday 
prayers at al-Istikamah Mosque in al-Jizah Square in Cairo, 
cites the prayer imam's remarks on Jewish treachery, and slogan 
shouting by the worshipers. The report says security forces 
surrounded the area to forestall any planned march on the 
Israeli Embassy. A report on page 3 describes similar protests 
following Friday prayers in Alexandria and police measures to 
prevent demonstrations. 
  A 500-word report on page 3 describes the security forces' 
confrontation with worshipers who marched out of al-Azhar Mosque 
after Friday prayers to protest the Hebron shooting. The mosque 
was surrounded and tear gas was used to disperse the 
demonstrators. 
  Other accounts of protests against the al-Ibrahimi incident 
include a clash between police and demonstrators following 
Friday prayers outside Mustafa Mahmud Mosque in Cairo's 
al-Muhandisin quarter, marches by factory workers and students 
in Hulwan, and reports on prayers said for the souls of the 
victims of the Hebron incident in various parts of the country. 
  The paper carries on page 1 a six-column by 7-inch 
photograph 
showing police cars and security personnel against a backdrop of 
an al-Azhar building. The photo has the following caption: 
"Al-Azhar Square turns into a battleground." The rest of the 
page is almost entirely taken up by seven other smaller 
photographs depicting security measures around al-Azhar and 
worshipers marching and raising Koran copies in their hands. 
One picture shows "security forces arresting Labor Party member 
Muhammad Ibrahim." The only text on the page is part of the 
chief editor's article. 
<H5>  CALL TO JIHAD </H5>
  A 1,500-word account of a professional associations 
conference in Cairo cites a speech by SLP [referred to here as 
the Islamic Labor Party] Secretary General 'Adil Husayn who says 
Ramadan this year has turned into a month of martyrdom in 
addition to fasting and worship. He appeals to Egyptian police 
officers not to confront young demonstrators with bullets 
because he views the Egyptian police as too worthy to be equated 
with the Israelis. He declares: "We have not met here to weep 
for there is no time for weeping. Indeed, it is almost a sin to 
weep. It is the time of anger and preparation for revenge." 
  Speaking at the same conference, Muslim Brotherhood Deputy 
General Guide Ahmad al-Malat chastises the government for doing 
nothing about the Hebron shooting and asks: "Have they been 
struck dumb? Has Clinton not given them permission yet?" 
  Al-Malat says: "Young people, you are the remaining hope. 
You are the resource. Work should begin today, not tomorrow. 
It is the hope to rescue Palestine... by jihad. Jihad is the 
only way. Every young man among you must prepare himself for 
the day when he will answer the call to jihad." 

<H5>    ATTITUDES TOWARD ISRAEL </H5>
  On page 5 there is a 2,000-word report on a conference 
organized by faculty members from various Egyptian universities 
during which academics expressed solidarity with the Palestinian 
people, backed the Palestinian demand for the removal of the 
Israeli settlements, and urged the immediate severance of 
diplomatic ties with Israel. 
  Mustafa Bakri, in a 700-word article on page 5 carrying the 
headline "The Volcano of Anger," says the conflict with Israel 
is one of existence, not a mere border dispute, and the whole of 
Palestine must be regained. Noting that the regime is incapable 
of confronting Israel, he says the hope lies with the people, 
especially the young. 
  Islamic preacher and writer Muhammad al-Ghazali, in his 
Tuesday column "This Is Our Religion," says the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre comes as no surprise because Jews are brought up 
in the religious tradition of waging "a war of extermination 
against their enemies." 
<H5>  GOVERNMENT POLICY AND ESTABLISMENT MEDIA </H5>
  Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn in a 1,500-word article on 
pages 1 and 9 speaks of the eruption of public anger against 
Israel and the Egyptian Government which cooperates, normalizes 
ties, and advocates "hot peace" with it. After referring to the 
protests of 4 March at al-Azhar and the concurrent meeting of 
opposition leaders there, he contrasts the government's failure 
to respond to the Hebron massacre with its success at putting 
down domestic unrest and protests. He declares that no good can 
come from a government riddled with financial corruption and 
whose inability to remedy the country's problems is rivalled 
only by its success in clinging to power against the public 
wish. He urges all patriotic forces to unite in order to force 
the government to listen to the opposition's views and calls for 
pursuing the difficult road of democracy until the time comes 
when the people can choose their own rulers. 
  A 1,500-word article by Muhammad Hilal on page 4 takes 
Egyptian television to task for carrying less coverage on the 
Hebron massacre than Israeli television and continuing to show 
its quiz shows, boring serials, and "rotten" films. He notes 
that Egyptian television took care not to cover the 4-March 
Friday prayers from al-Azhar Mosque because its officials 
realized it was going to be the scene of protests and instead 
relayed prayers from another Cairo mosque. 
  SLP deputy leader Muhammad Hilmi Murad, writing about the 
country's "popular awakening" in an article on page 7, calls on 
the government to take people's wishes into account and urges 
opposition parties, professional associations, and labor parties 
to advocate and defend popular causes. 
<H5>  CHURCH AND STATE </H5>
  Muslim Brotherhood columnist Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus 
addresses his thanks to university students across the country 
for refuting the initial foreign news agencies' description of 
the popular Egyptian reaction to the Hebron massacre as 
"lukewarm and feeble." In his back-page column on page 12, he 
also refers to the massive protests by professional associations 
and worshipers and notes that these demonstrations reassured him 
that Arabhood and Islam still flow in the country's veins. He 
says: "Frankly, I feared for my country from the advocates of 
pharaonism and isolation and the haters who demand separation of 
religion and state." Adding that such people control state 
media and education, he notes that he had been worrying that 
they would "brainwash" the people into believing that they were 
solely Egyptian, unconcerned with events in the Arab and Islamic 
world. 
<H5>  CULTURAL CONFLICT </H5>
  An approximately 3,000-word article on page 12, by Mahjub 
'Umar, analyzes the cultural conflict between the Arabs and 
Israel, which cannot be ended by interim agreements but will 
continue until the "racist aggressor agrees to restore rights 
and to live in equality under the aegis of the region's 
prevailing, Arab-Islamic culture." He says that the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre was a microcosm of this cultural conflict and 
that the attacker, Baruch Goldstein, was a product of his 
culture and cannot be called insane unless all members of his 
community are called insane too. Noting that Israel itself is 
the original, large settlement, he foresees the day when the 
world will accept its disarmament. 
  Muslim Brotherhood official and columnist Mustafa Mashhur 
refers, in a 1,500-word article on page 7, to the long-standing 
but unsuccessful attempts by Egypt's enemies to dilute its 
Islamic character, including attempts by French and British 
occupiers to introduce foreign laws into the country, by 
proselytizing, and the propagation of dissolute Western culture. 
  He says that after Hasan al-Banna founded the Muslim 
Brotherhood in 1928 with the aim of reviving the Muslim state 
following the overthrow of the Ottoman Empire, there came the 
secularist onslaught against al-Azhar and against Islamic laws 
and courts, the shackling of Egypt by the Camp David Accord, and 
the attempt to forge normal ties between "Egypt's Muslim people 
and the Zionist enemy who usurps Palestine." He declares that 
all these attempts have failed and young men and women are 
embracing religion, filling mosques to capacity, and wearing 
Islamic attire voluntarily. He adds that their support for the 
Palestinian cause remains strong. 
<H5>  REGIME'S DOWNFALL PREDICTED </H5>
  A 750-word article by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on page 4 
accuses the government of idiocy, hatred for the public, and 
love for Israel and the Kach movement. In the article, entitled 
"An Eyewitness to the Regime's Crime," the writer views the 
security forces' use of tear gas against al-Azhar as a sign of 
the regime's imminent demise.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of "valuable and important" speech by President </F>
Saddam Husayn on 13 March; place not given] 
  [Text] Many happy returns to you, your people, your 
families, and your ministries' employees. There is always great 
hope that you and your brother workers will make your people 
really feel that everyday you extend to them a higher level of 
service than others in the same circumstances could offer them. 
  Among the things that we know is the fact that when one 
supposes that he has done his best and cannot offer a higher 
level of service he will stop both his intellectual development 
and the introduction of new challenges or incentives for 
himself. In this country, the state of Iraq--knowing that you 
are its ministers--such a feeling should be unknown to us all. 
We should feel satisfied--should anything we do actually call 
for satisfaction--with what we have offered, along with the 
strong feeling that we can offer something still better in 
quality and taking into account the calculations of quantity or 
numbers. 
  The circumstances of your people are difficult. They have 
been imposed on us by the unjust despot. Leading those who are 
taking the position of doing harm to and premeditated malice 
against the Iraqi people are the United States and Zionism. The 
blockade has been continuing for four years, that is since the 
cease-fire went into effect after a decision made by the former 
U.S. President on 28 February 1991. We have thus far dealt with 
the Security Council resolutions as part of the diplomatic 
efforts and what they suggest in terms of possibilities designed 
to overcome any obstacle and deal with the unfair resolutions in 
a way that achieves a better level of understanding by the 
Security Council. 
  We hoped, and perhaps we expected or rather many people in 
our country and the world expected that this level of dealings 
on the part of Iraq, although the resolutions are unfair and 
unjust and carry a measure of premeditated malice by known 
people in the Security Council who have an effective role in 
passing the resolutions, including the United States, would 
realize a level of achievement--despite the unfair 
resolutions--that would make some people, whose hearts have no 
feeling, show a flexible position and open the doors again to 
the Iraqi people so they can live in freedom, as they should. 
  However, others were quite convinced that the criminal 
level of the aggression and the way sanctions were implemented 
on Iraq, including the embargo resolution, came from minds 
without any conscience. 
  Therefore, despite Iraq's offers and responses, those 
concerned will discover that there is nothing being given in 
return. Besides, what was talked about in terms of Security 
Council obligations is nothing more than a tactical cover to 
make Iraq fulfill its obligations without the Security Council 
having to fulfill its own obligations. This is because members 
of the Security Council do not have enough freedom to say what 
they want to say. Moreover, the Security Council does not have 
standards based on fairness and justice because there are those 
who oppose such standards and can influence them in the opposite 
direction. 
  As I have repeatedly said, there is a daily instigator that 
encourages America and Zionism to conspire against the Arab 
nation. According to the treasonous and tendentious ones, Iraq 
is among the first against whom they should conspire. This is 
because of Iraq's stand toward the principles which make the 
Arab nation gain more honor--after it further enhances its honor 
based on our nation's inherited high standards and behavior. 
Iraq is working in this direction and is known for its stand on 
entrenching these values. 
  Everyday one commission comes and another one goes. They 
have destroyed the weapons, the plants, and the factories they 
wanted to destroy--apart from what had already been destroyed by 
their warplanes and missiles. They got all the information they 
asked for. They said they wanted future guarantees before 
fulfilling their obligations toward Iraq. Despite this, Iraq 
agreed on the so- called long-term monitoring. 
  All the resolutions that deal with Iraq's obligations were 
implemented according to the sequence set by the Security 
Council and in accordance with the priorities of these 
resolutions. Despite all this, they still tell Iraqi diplomats 
that if you did this then it will be possible to lift the 
embargo or at least implement Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. 
We mean section C of Resolution 687. 
  After the initial resolutions, they issued a series of 
resolutions, some of which do not represent the essence of the 
initial resolutions. At times, the latter resolutions were even 
in contradiction with some paragraphs of the initial 
resolutions, on which the conditions for Iraq's withdrawal from 
Kuwait and Iraq's compliance with the destruction of the 
so-called weapons of mass destruction were built. This includes 
Resolution 715. At last, we asked: What is left? They said: 
Only this resolution, no. 715, is left. As soon as you approve 
it, we will write a report to the UN Security Council. We said: 
Iraq's obligations have been fulfilled, you should fulfill 
yours, starting with the implementation of Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687. In short, this paragraph provides for allowing 
Iraq to export its products, chiefly oil. Iraq said: We are 
not convinced that this resolution should be discussed now. We 
should work in accordance with the sequence of the clauses of 
Resolution 687 and its mutual obligations. However, we approved 
that resolution in order to end our people's suffering. They 
responded: What? No. First, we will start monitoring and make 
sure that Iraq is implementing it the way we want--the way Ekeus 
wants--in order to make sure that Iraq is committed. Afterward, 
we will consider submitting a report to the UN Security Council 
so that it would look into Paragraph 22. Well, we asked, when 
will you start? You have already started monitoring, have you 
not? What is monitoring? Does it require anything more than 
installing cameras? We asked: In your assessment, how long 
would this process take? You have already started it. The 
cameras are installed and recording. We said: Fine, when will 
you start to count time? Ekeus said the operation may take six 
months. After he departed, he said that some say six months, 
some say one year. Who are those some? Well, when will we 
start? What about those months that you have already spent 
monitoring? Are not they counted? When will you tell us that 
you have started, so that we can start counting? How long do 
you need? Three months, four months, six months? When can we 
say, for example, one or two months have passed, four months to 
go? This is needed so that the Iraqi people will be able to 
make their plans, see what they can do, and prepare themselves 
psychologically and economically for the required duration. He 
kept coming and going, everyday emerging with statements without 
a clear specification of the time after which the implementation 
of Paragraph 22 can start. 
  Well, how long will the Iraqi people wait, and how can they 
accept the diplomacy of the fox of the jungle? We and the Iraqi 
people have spent much time hearing this and contacting and 
seeing people. It is their right to choose alternatives if they 
discover that this way will not lead to a positive result that 
can save them from this injustice or put them in a better 
position to be able to deal with life without this injustice; 
namely, the blockade and the parallels imposed on northern and 
southern Iraq. 
  On this occasion, the Security Council says in one of its 
resolutions that it is obliged to do everything that will secure 
Iraq's sovereignty. Isn't that true, specialists? Well, where 
is Iraq's sovereignty? It is the Security Council's permanent 
member states that imposed these parallels in violation of 
Iraq's sovereignty. They issue resolutions but they do not 
apply them when it comes to their obligations and they even 
violate them in public. 
  Deputy Prime Minister comrade Tariq 'Aziz is scheduled to 
leave for the UN Security Council. He will clearly explain to 
them that we have fulfilled our obligations. According to logic 
and fair and just treatment, they have to fulfill their 
obligations. If they do not implement their obligations now, 
they will not have the simplest excuse with which to cover their 
delay. They should implement Provision 22 immediately and 
without any conditions. 
  If comrade Tariq 'Aziz returns without obtaining the 
Security 
Council's agreement to meet its obligations and if there is no 
hope that the injustice will be lifted from the Iraqi people, 
then the Iraqi people and their leadership can do nothing else 
but decide what they believe will give them hope, God willing, 
in the direction they believe is sound. Therefore, the 
ministers should take steps to prolong their people's patience 
as much as much possible and to speed up efforts to achieve as 
much public service as possible. Rely on God.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, member of the </F>
Israeli Knesset and head of the Israeli Arab delegation, by 
unidentified Syrian Arab Television correspondent in Damascus on 
10 March--recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Syrian Arab Television is pleased to 
host 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, who has led a delegation of Arabs 
of Palestine to offer condolences to their kinsfolk in Syria. 
Syrian Arab Television welcomes you to your homeland Syria. 
  [Darawshah] Thank you. I also thank all our kinsfolk in 
Syria, this sisterly country. We are proud of this country, of 
its president, of its steadfastness, and of its continuous 
struggle. 
  [Reporter] Let us begin with the following issue: Syria and 
the Syrian stand, vis-a-vis the Palestine question and the 
Palestinians themselves, have a special place among our kinsfolk 
in Palestine. How do you explain this feeling which prompted 
you to come to Syria to offer condolences to your people here? 
  [Darawshah] As part of the Arab nation and the Palestinian 
people, we are linked with our Arab nation through strong ties 
of Arabism, blood, and sincere friendship, as well as through 
the desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. We are 
closely following all developments related to the peace issue 
within the framework of the Arab-Israeli talks, as well as the 
distinguished Syrian stand and the true peace adopted by 
President al-Asad and the Syrian Government and largely 
supported by the Syrians. We are following these matters with 
satisfaction and with support. At the same time, we feel that 
this stand represents Arab dignity and pride. There is a desire 
to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, but without 
relinquishing any Arab rights. Therefore, when we heard about 
the loss of martyr Basil al-Asad we, the sons of this nation, 
were stricken by the event and felt it to be the tragedy of all 
of us. We felt that we were dutybound to come to offer 
condolences to the president, to his family, to the Syrian 
Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people. 
  I am very grateful and greatly appreciate the fact that His 
Excellency President al-Asad agreed to allow the delegation to 
come to Syria to offer condolences. We were pleased with this 
because we, the Palestinians inside Israel, have suffered from 
the long siege not only by the Israeli Government but also by 
the Arab world which has not treated us fairly. We had been 
prevented from entering the Arab world. This is a good 
beginning and a positive step which we truly praise. We also 
thank President Hafiz al-Asad for this. 
  [Reporter] You have spoken in your answer about peace and 
the 
desire to achieve just and comprehensive peace. You are 
up-to-date on the stands of Israel vis-a-vis the peace process. 
Does peace have a chance? What are the obstacles to peace? Is 
Israel serious in its efforts? 
  [Darawshah] I would like to say that the stand of this 
Israeli Government is better than the stand of the Shamir 
government. However, although the Rabin government has created 
better circumstances at the negotiating table, it has not made 
the required concessions to give a momentum to the peace process. 
  The abstruse obstacle lies in the fact that the Israeli 
Government has thus far not declared openly that it is ready to 
withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and to recognize the 
Palestinian people's right to self- determination, one they 
deserve just like any other people under the sun. Therefore, we 
call for the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace and 
for Israeli withdrawal from all ccupied Arab territories, from 
the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, the occupied 
Syrian Golan Heights, and the occupied Jordanian territories. 
Only then could a true atmosphere be created to push the peace 
process forward and to achieve full peace. This is what we are 
trying to make the Israeli Government understand. We say this 
from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the Knesset in 
Jerusalem. We say it in Washington, in Paris, in Cairo, and 
everywhere. This is because the cause of right and justice is 
indivisible. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, you know that the peace process, 
from the very beginning, was based on the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land for peace principle; 
namely, full Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Arab 
territories in return for full peace. Can either of the two 
parts of this equation be implemented without the other? 
  [Darawshah] There will be no peace under occupation. The 
continuation of occupation means the continuation of war, 
massacres, suppression, and repression. Furthermore, peace 
cannot be achieved with the continuation of settlements. What 
does settlement mean? It is a form of colonialism that occupies 
land, deprives people of their rights, and establishes 
settlements of the colonialist settlers who occupy the Arab 
land. Based on this, we say that there is an essential 
contradiction between peace and occupation, and between peace 
and settlements. The Israeli Government should announce its 
readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, 
dismantle settlements, and return all settlers to Israel within 
the 1967 border. There should be no negotiations, wrangling, 
and stubbornness over gaining land or over keeping settlements 
in the occupied Arab territories. 
  [Reporter] I wanted to ask you about settlements, and about 
this Israeli policy, whose results we are seeing now, and the 
best proof of this is the recent Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? Can 
settlements and peace, which Israel claims it wants, go together? 
  [Darawshah] We have always said, and I repeat that 
settlements constitute an unsurmountable obstacle to peace. 
Peace will never be achieved with the continuation of 
settlements, especially since we are talking about an extremist 
group of settlers most of whom came from the United States or 
Russia. Those who came from the United States are really 
extremists. Most of them are affiliated with fascist rightist 
forces such as the racist Kakh movement, the Kahane movement, 
and the security on roads movement which carry out daily hostile 
acts against the sons of our Palestinian people in terms of 
killing, massacres, terrorism, demolishing houses, and 
indiscriminate firing. Regrettably, the Israeli Army forces and 
other security forces protect them, but they do not protect the 
Palestinians. They also supply them with arms and with all that 
they need. Even if they carry out barbaric and brutal acts 
against the Palestinians, they do not stand trial and they will 
not be arrested. We believe that the continuation of 
settlements conflicts with peace. The Israeli Government should 
openly announce that it is ready to evacuate the settlements. 
  [Reporter] Let us talk about the Israeli political 
structure with which you are in contact. What is your 
assessment of the stands of the government or the opposition 
regarding the peace process? 
  [Darawshah] So far the government coalition is narrow. It 
consists of 56 members of the Knesset -- the Labor and Meretz 
Parties. It is supported by the Arab parties -- the Arab 
Democratic Party and the Democratic Front for Peace and 
Equality. Together they form the so-called buffer [al-mani'ah] 
bloc which consists of 61 members of the Knesset. Yitzhaq Rabin 
is attempting to expand his government. It seems that he has 
succeeded in this and he is expected to announce at the Knesset 
on Monday the return of SHAS, the religious Eastern Jewish 
party, to the government coalition. This party has six members. 
Thus, the coalition government will consist of 62 members. If 
the government continues to receive the support of the Arab 
parties the government will win a big majority, 67 members of 
the Knesset. This majority would enable the government to 
continue the peace process and to make concessions that will 
respond to the true Arab demands; that is, the demands of the 
Palestinian people and the regional states -- Lebanon, Syria, 
and Jordan. Therefore, the government will have more 
parliamentary support than today. However, despite this ... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Excuse me Mr. Darawshah, Rabin's 
attempts to expand the coalition by including Tzomet and others 
have specific objectives and repercussions. In addition to 
making decisions, which you called concessions, but we do not, 
the expansion of the coalition will have specific repercussions, 
because these groups have objectives and demands. How will 
Rabin's objective match the objectives of these groups? 
  [Darawshah] Before I came to Syria, when I was asked about 
including Tzomet or Mafdal, I said that this is a maneuver by 
Yitzhaq Rabin to return the Shas to the government and to weaken 
the effect of the left-wing movement Meretz and the Arab parties 
within the buffer block. He wants to enjoy more support within 
the Knesset. He does not want the Arab members of the Knesset 
to have a larger effect. At the same time, he wants to go to 
Washington with a broader government and coalition. I also 
believe that if he wants to take certain steps against the 
settlers -- something which he is required to do -- he needs 
more support from the Knesset. He does not want others to say 
that he is taking these steps or embarking on these peaceful 
operations with a government that depends on Arab votes in the 
Knesset. He wants to say -- and he said it publicly -- that he 
seeks to embark on steps through a government coalition, 
depending on Jewish votes. We say this is a racist approach. 
He cannot end our existence in this method. At the same time, 
we support expanding the coalition if Shas joins the coalition. 
If Rabin agrees to let Tzomet or Mafdal, two extremist parties 
hostile to the Arabs inside and to the whole Arab nation, join 
the coalition, we will withdraw our support for the government 
and present a no-confidence motion in an attempt to topple the 
government. We have always been part of the buffer block to 
prevent the right-wing parties from reaching the government, not 
for supporting the right wing inside the government. I think 
that the peace process will continue despite the existing 
difficulties. 
  But Yitzhaq Rabin is required first to state that he is 
prepared to accept the formula which President Hafiz al-Asad 
stated yesterday during his meeting with us. He stated -- 
frankly, publicly, and in a courageous and dignified manner -- 
that we support the complete peace in return for complete 
withdrawal and the land-for-peace formula. This clarity, this 
clear strategic view of peace, dictates that the Israeli 
Government should take a stand. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, your statements are very precise 
on Israel's attempts to avoid Syria's position, especially what 
happened in Geneva. Before Geneva, Israel tried to circumvent 
what would happen in Geneva because it sensed Syria's courageous 
and clear position. Can you explain the future strategies in 
the light of what happened in Geneva and Syria's stands? 
  [Darawshah] In his meeting with President Clinton in Geneva, 
President al-Asad in fact represented the Arab nation. He 
represented its aspirations and the position that reflects the 
will of this nation and its aspirations to secure a better 
future and achieve a just and comprehensive peace, as well as 
Arab dignity. Therefore, we were all happy to see the president 
speaking in Geneva and meeting with the president of the most 
powerful country in the world, the United States, and 
representing with dignity and pride this nation, this 
deep-rooted nation, the Arab nation, of which we are proud to be 
part. 
  I believe he was clear and forthright when he stated the 
Arab 
nation's stand on peace and the peace position of the Syrian 
people and government. But, Israel attempted to conceal this 
position and avoid making a positive stand that corresponds to 
that position. Therefore, they tried to undervalue the 
president's statements. The Israeli foreign minister's reaction 
today to President Hafiz al-Asad's statements yesterday on the 
peace strategy and the complete withdrawal in return for 
complete peace was lukewarm because he does not want to show the 
Israeli people the crystal-clear fact that Syria wants peace, a 
just and comprehensive peace, a peace of the brave, a peace that 
was publicly stated by President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva and 
yesterday during his meeting with the delegation that came to 
offer condolences to him. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, let us return to the Zionist 
political structure and Zionist thought. Zionism, as you well 
know, is standing at a crossroads. This does not mean 
abandoning Zionism. Old Zionism is known, but what is new in the 
Zionist thought and direction? 
  [Darawshah] There is a split today inside Zionism and inside 
the Israeli political structure, and even inside the world's 
Jewish and Zionist movements. There is a rational trend that 
says we must achieve peace with the Arab world and we must end 
occupation. Some people affiliated with this trend -- a strong 
segment indeed -- support the Palestinian people's right to 
self-determination and the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel in the West bank 
and Gaza Strip. They also oppose settlement activities. The 
demonstrations staged by tens of thousands of people last 
Saturday was a joint demonstration by the Arab and Jewish 
peace-advocating forces, and we participated in it. That 
demonstration raised clear slogans: No to the horrendous 
massacres by settlers against the Palestinian people and no to 
the policy of suppression and repression. It also demanded the 
evacuation of settlements and the recognition of the just and 
comprehensive peace that would end occupation and guarantee the 
establishment of the independent Palestinian state. On the 
other hand, there is a significant trend in the Israeli 
opposition today. This represents the right-wing Israeli 
parties, led by the Likud. It also includes the Mafdal, Tzomet, 
and the extremist fascist party, Moledet, which advocates the 
transfer and the expulsion of Arabs. 
  These parties still raise the slogan of the integral land 
of Israel, from the sea to the river, and some of them say from 
the river to the river [from the Nile to the Euphrates]. These 
people do not want peace, and they only talk about peace for 
peace. This is a big camp within the Israeli political 
spectrum, but it is now in the opposition. Yitzhaq Rabin 
oscillates between the two wings: the left wing which calls for 
a just and comprehensive peace, and the extremist rightist wing 
which wants to keep all the occupied Arab territories, and does 
not want to concede an inch of land, as they say. What they 
want is the integral land of Israel. The Israeli Government's 
stand is linked with the pressures exerted by each camp. Rabin 
is for the coalition and for the left, but he himself has 
rightist trends. It is known that he is a hawk within the Labor 
Party, while the dove's wing is now led by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres and his deputy Yosi Beilin, and some other 
ministers like Yosi Sarid, 'Uzi Bar'am, and others. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah, I, as an Arab citizen, along with 
the Arab citizen who is watching us now, cannot imagine that 
there are hawks and doves, or that there is any difference 
between Yosi Sarid, Yosi Beilin, Rabin, Shamir, Kahane, or even 
Begin. This is because we cannot distinguish between these 
people, especially since the Arab citizen is persecuted by all 
of them. Some citizens believe that a solution is impossible in 
light of Israel's policy of trying cancel out the other party 
[Palestinian people]. What is your comment? 
  [Darawshah] Despite all the criticism of Israeli policy, 
which I also criticize, I can understand Arab sentiments and 
feelings concerning everything that is related to the Israeli 
position. As an Arab, I also feel this inside me. However, I 
do not generalize. In politics, we must put facts down and work 
with the surgeon's scalpel. We must cut things and analyze them 
with our own Arab scalpel. We must examine things very 
carefully. There is a panoramic view, which I do not dismiss, 
but, in order to establish this general approach for the Arab 
nation, we must be aware of the details. Concerning the 
details, there is a difference between an Israeli Jew who 
believes in peace, wants peace, and demonstrates for peace, and 
calls for evacuating the settlements and the occupied Arab 
territories, and works for this, and an Israeli Jew who adheres 
to occupation, who does not offer anything in return for a peace 
agreement, and believes in the integral land of Israel. These 
differences do exist. 
  [Reporter] It could be the difference between one who 
murders 
brutally and another who murders with dexterity. Any way, let 
us hear from you Mr. Darawshah about our people in the occupied 
territories who suffer from discrimination. What do they say, 
how are they doing? 
  [Darawshah] The sons of our Palestinian people inside 
Israel, 
who number approximately 800,000 Palestinians, live mainly in 
the Galilee, the Triangle, and Negev, or in the mixed cities 
such as 'Akko, Haifa, Yafo, Lod, and al-Ramlah. We are the 
owners of the homeland, of the land. We did not leave our 
homeland, and we do not want to achieve the objective of the 
extremist Jews and settlers, that is transfer or expel Arabs. 
  Therefore, our slogan has been, and will continue to be: 
We will remain here, for as long as olives and thyme remain. 
We stick to our land, our homeland, with roots deep in our 
national soil. We also want to improve our quality and increase 
our number to be able to stand up against the major challenges 
facing us. We have suffered from racial discrimination and the 
military occupation policy and a military rule that was imposed 
on us until 1966. After the military rule ended, we began to 
struggle for civil and national rights. We were not recognized 
and most of our land was confiscated. We suffer from a flagrant 
policy of racial discrimination in all fields of life. I do not 
say this only here in Damascus. We say it also from every 
rostrum; that the racial discrimination policy is directed 
against any non-Jewish person inside Israel and we resist this 
racial policy. 
  Despite all this, we continue our struggle to gain further 
rights. At the same time, we do not relinquish our right to a 
dignified, free life and the right of our Palestinian people to 
gain their independence, freedom, and get rid of occupation. 
  [Reporter] You have mentioned the land and said you are the 
owners of the land. Mr. Darawshah, the anniversary of Land Day, 
30 March, is approaching. What has happened to the Yisra'el 
Koenig Document, and much is it being implemented? And, what do 
you have to say about land and Land Day? 
  [Darawshah] So far, it has not been officially announced 
that the Koenig Document has been annulled. Even recently, it 
was announced that there are plans to build 26 new Jewish 
settlements in Galilee. The current Israeli Government says it 
stopped the confiscation of land. However, we fear another type 
of land confiscation, the confiscation of land for the 
so-called public interest; large highways, for example, the 
300-meter wide inter-Israel highway which passes mostly in Arab 
land. This, therefore, is a new type of confiscation. At the 
same time, over 50 percent of the Arab lands that are owned by 
Palestinian Arab citizens have been confiscated since the 
establishment of Israel under feeble excuses, under various 
excuses and justifications -- security, settlements, or the 
so-called public interest. Therefore, we call for the return of 
this land because most of it has not been utilized yet. The 
land must be returned to its rightful owners. 
  In our struggle to stick to our land, or what remained of 
the 
land because most of the land has very unfortunately been 
confiscated, we want to stick to our homeland. Any attempt to 
detach us from our land means an attempt to detach us from our 
homeland. Therefore, we stick to the land in order to survive. 
So, sticking to our land is a principal part of our 
steadfastness inside our homeland. The Land Day anniversary -- 
this immortal day-- comes to remind us that the land is still 
threatened and that land means honor. Therefore, we want to 
defend the land and the honor and the dignity of this nation. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Darawshah: During this visit, you visited 
al-Qunaytirah and met with President Hafiz al-Asad. Can you 
tell us what you have heard and seen. Let us start with your 
visit to al-Qunaytirah. What did al-Qunaytirah tell you? 
  [Darawshah] The destroyed, and at the same time, liberated, 
al-Qunaytirah, left a major, and, equally, a painful, impression 
on me. So did the destroyed houses, in which more than 50,000 
Syrian Arabs citizens, who were forced to flee their homes, 
lived. This was a horrendous crime which is unacceptable to 
anyone. 
  I condemned this hideous crime and said: Peace and 
good-neighborly relations cannot be established in this way. 
Such an act will not produce positive results because it is a 
terrorist, aggressive, barbaric act against the Syrian people 
and the Arab nation. Israeli media organs asked me: How can 
you criticize the Israeli policy on this issue in al-Qunaytirah? 
Why do you not say this in Jerusalem? I told them that I said 
this in Jerusalem and criticized the demolition of Arab 
villages. I am criticizing the demolition of al-Qunaytirah 
because this is a barbaric act which is not accepted at all. 
  I believe that the policy which prompted the Israeli 
Government to demolish al-Qunaytirah is an aggressive policy. I 
hope this will not be repeated in the future. This does not 
only mean occupying land; it also means obliterating Arab 
features. 
  [Reporter] As takes place in Palestine. 
  [Darawshah] As took place and is taking place in Palestine. 
Many Arab villages were demolished. In Galilee, in the village 
of (?Itsal) in Marj Ibn 'Amir, where I live, many houses are 
demolished. Many other Arab villages in the area remind us of 
the terrible tragedy. When I came and visited al-Qunaytirah, 
which was destroyed, I cried and was pained because this 
reminded me also of our Palestinian villages which were 
destroyed. 
  [Reporter] About your meeting with the president. 
  [Darawshah] The meeting gave us a feeling of the pride of 
affiliation with this nation, the genuine Arab nation of which 
we are proud. Despite all circumstances, we did not kneel down, 
we did not bow, and we were not humiliated. We adhered to our 
Palestinian and Arab identity and to our lofty pan-Arabism. Our 
meeting with the president reminded us of Arab loftiness, 
dignity, and free will. We were in front of a great man who has 
a strategic view and enlightened thinking. He is gentle and 
modest. In fact, all members of the delegation felt these 
positive characteristics during the meeting with President 
al-Asad. He increased our pride of our affiliation and our love 
for al-Asad's Syria and President al-Asad. We came to offer our 
condolences to his excellency and to our Syrian people. After 
offering our condolences we emerged from the meeting full of the 
feelings of faithful brotherly relations and genuine 
pan-Arabism, loftiness, and dignity represented by President 
al-Asad. 
  On this occasion, I would like to greet President Hafiz 
al-Asad, may God preserve him, the heroic fraternal Syrian 
people, our Palestinian people living in Syria in solidarity 
with the Syrian people. The Palestinians living in al-Yarmuk 
Camp and in other places told us they feel that Syria is their 
homeland and that they are given their rights like the Syrian 
citizens. Therefore, the delegation came on behalf of the 
Palestinian masses to offer condolences on the death of Basil 
al-Asad, martyr of the Arab nation. We heard and read a great 
deal about Basil's views, nationalism, and struggle. Again, we 
greatly appreciate President al-Asad, the Syrian Government, and 
the fraternal Syrian people. We are proud that we and the 
Syrian people are affiliated with this Arab nation. We wish 
Syria, this country of brave, and al-Asad, every progress. 
  [Reporter] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah. You are welcome 
again in Syrian Arab Television and in your country Syria. 
Thank you. 
  [Darawshah] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ja'ja', commander of the </F>
Lebanese Forces, by Salim Badawi in the studio on 10 January; 
place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Ja'ja'] I am not going to quarrel with anyone. But 
when you have a house with three doors that lead only into this 
house and they deploy militarily or place barricades at these 
entrances, call it what you will. However, what I wanted to say 
is that by behaving like this and striking at the last string of 
the credibility that it may still have, the Lebanese government 
is not leading to anything. This means that it is widening the 
gap between it and its people. This is not good and will not 
lead to anything. The Lebanese government is destroying itself 
by this behavior, when it has many greater concerns on the 
national level, on security violations, current events, the 
Middle East peace process, and on many other (?levels.) 
Instead, the entire government is engaged in -- and I apologize 
to the listeners for using this phrase -- political 
inconsistencies [dhabdhabat] and practices that do not become 
the state in any form. 
  [Badawi] In your view, what is the reason behind erecting 
military barricades today, especially in front of the Lebanese 
Forces positions and the Samir Ja'ja' headquarters in Ghidras? 
  [Ja'ja'] I have no clear answer, but such practices become 
larger or smaller in accordance with the Lebanese Forces' 
political stand. This is not acceptable. The government should 
not have anything to do with the political stands of any 
political group in the arena in any form whatsoever. Otherwise, 
conditions become as you can see them and therefore, the 
credibility of the government will be destroyed and ... 
  [Badawi, interrupting] Can we link today's operation to the 
news conference you held following the massacre at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat church and the stands you expressed at that time? 
  [Ja'ja'] Apparently, from now on the question has become 
that 
of analyses and inferences. Yes, it is possible. I do not have 
any other explanation. This is the situation and these are the 
facts. As to the reasons, I do not know. But I know these 
practices harm the state in the first place. 
  [Badawi] Dr. Ja'ja', I would like to know your preliminary 
reaction to remarks by General Michel 'Awn in the newspaper 
AL-HAYAH today. 'Awn says a federation should be established in 
Lebanon, or a form that is above the religious denominations, 
that is, a secular regime. What do you think of this. Do you 
not see in it a repetition of your previous proposal for 
federation in Lebanon? 
  [Ja'ja'] We originally proposed the decentralization, or 
federation, after a careful and deep study of the Lebanese 
situation, the historical and the political situation in 
general, the sociological conditions. It was not just a remark. 
It was the result of a long process of fermentation in the 
Lebanese political situation. I hope the rest of the political 
groups -- before we again suffer through this and pass through 
this experience for the second, third, fifth and tenth time -- 
will really study the real situation. Eventually they will 
reach a clear conclusion like General 'Awn's conclusion, because 
this is reality. There is nothing magic about it. One reads 
the reality today, the other reads it two years from now, the 
third reads it after ten years. All this will be a waste of time. 
  [Badawi] Thank You, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'. 
  [Ja'ja'] You are welcome.

  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev left Tunis 
yesterday evening after a short visit during which he held talks 
with Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahia at Tunis Carthage 
international airport on the peace process, the current 
situation in the Middle East region, and Tunisian-Russian 
relations. 
  Kozyrev had earlier held talks with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat with regard to giving a boost to the Middle East 
peace process. This was also the chief topic of a meeting 
between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and President 'Arafat. 
  The Palestinian president held a dinner banquet in honor of 
the Russian foreign minister, to which Foreign Minister Ben 
Yahia was invited. After the dinner talks were held between the 
Palestinian and Russian delegations. Mr. Ben Yahia also 
attended the discussions. 
  After the two-hour working session with President 'Arafat 
and 
his aides, which was attended by Mr. Ben Yahia, the Russian 
foreign minister announced in Tunis that the PLO chairman is 
ready to resume the negotiations with Israel. He told 
journalists, in President 'Arafat's presence, that he was very 
pleased to announce that President 'Arafat had made a most 
important and brave political decision by promising to resume 
the negotiations and continue the peace process. 
  President 'Arafat, who avoided talking about the resumption 
of negotiations with Israel, confined himself to saying that he 
remains committed to the peace process despite the tragedy and 
the massacre. 
  The Russian foreign minister stressed the brave character of 
President 'Arafat's decision and pointed out his great 
contribution to establishing an era of comprehensive and just 
peace in the Middle East. He added that he had given President 
'Arafat an invitation from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to 
visit Moscow, without specifying a date. 
  President 'Arafat declared that the Palestinian leadership 
is 
expecting guarantees from the peace co-sponsors -- that is, the 
United States and Russia -- for the protection of the 
Palestinian people and their holy places. He said also that it 
is expecting Israel to carry out confidence-building measures 
for the continuation of the peace process. 
  The Russian foreign minister stated that what is required is 
to work first and specifically for reaching an agreement on Gaza 
and Jericho as soon as possible. He stressed that his country 
will work with all determination for the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles signed on 13 September between the PLO 
and Israel. He then emphasized that the United States and 
Russia had pledged, in their capacity as co-sponsors of the 
peace process, to watch over the full implementation of the 
resolution which will be adopted by the UN Security Council on 
the Hebron massacre. He also said that he will hold specific 
and serious talks with his U.S. counterpart at their meeting on 
Monday, regarding the elements of the resumption of peace and on 
the guarantees that the peace co-sponsors must provide in order 
to guarantee continuous progress for these negotiations. 
  On his arrival in Tunis for a brief visit, the Russian 
foreign minister said that Tunisia's role is essential within 
the framework of the efforts for the resumption of the Middle 
East peace process. He said that he had come to meet Foreign 
Minister Ben Yahia and President 'Arafat; he wished, he said, to 
express to President 'Arafat Russia's support for his brave 
leadership, his efforts to establish peace in the region, and 
his determination to prevent the enemies of peace from impeding 
its course. He added that he would hold thoroughgoing talks 
with President 'Arafat on the current situation in the region 
and ways to push forward the peace process. 
  Asked whether he had any proposals, he said: We have some 
ideas but we rely on the wisdom of President 'Arafat and his 
aides for progressing along the course of peace. He then 
pointed out that he had an important message from President 
Boris Yeltsin to President 'Arafat. 
  With regard to the Russian proposal concerning a call for a 
new international peace conference on the Middle East, Mr. 
Kozyrev said that that proposal remains open and what is certain 
now is the need to focus on seeking the means to rescue the 
peace process.

  [Text] Military sources have said that yesterday the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] took steps toward clarifying the 
open-fire instructions in the territories. Speaking to our army 
affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, the sources said the 
steps were designed to prevent confusion among soldiers caused 
by a Border Police officer's testimony before the Shamgar 
Commission. 
  Our correspondent notes that the steps are designed to 
elucidate the existing instructions, according to which weapons 
are not to be used when enforcing law and public order on 
Israelis in the territories. Nevertheless, when observing an 
Israeli civilian shooting to hit others, or endangering others' 
lives without being in a life-threatening situation himself, the 
soldiers have to take every reasonable measure, including the 
use of firearms.

<F P=106> [First Friday prayers sermon by President Akbar </F>
Hashemi-Rafsanjani at Tehran University on 11 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. [passage omitted] In the first sermon I will briefly 
discuss the effects of prayers during the month of Ramadan and 
the self-development in those days. I will also devote the 
second sermon totally to the issue of Palestine and Jerusalem 
and the global effects of such an important issue. [passage 
omitted] 
  Our nation which pays attention to prayers and evaluates the 
effects of its self-discipline should also recognize the value 
of such practices and not permit the incorrect and immature 
analysis of some so-called intellectuals, which is in fact 
narrow mindedness, to enter their mind with the idea that 
spending energy and time on prayers and fasting can be the cause 
of underdevelopment in economic and other issues. Even if such 
prayers did not exist and let us say that we could enjoy a 
strong economy, then we would have become like one of those 
advanced Western countries and that has never been our goal. 
  It is impossible to have a strong society without such basic 
foundations for the development of human beings in today's 
world. You can see how world arrogance and imperialism 
repeatedly deal violent blows to the Third World countries 
stopping them from getting up and standing on their own feet. 
We see the source of our resistance in prayers even if that 
might seem trivial and common to some, but prayers are deeply 
wise and constructive. 
  My point in this sermon is that we use this harvest that we 
have reaped from the holy month of Ramadan this year -- like 
other years, it is not an exceptional year -- to preserve the 
spirit of our piety throughout the year, especially since we are 
on the eve of a new year. With that same asset we are today 
rapidly taking the country forward in the face of so much 
conspiracy and mischief. 
  As the country's chief executive I say that without the 
presence of those earnest people on the scene the country could 
not advance, with all its enemies, with the method with which it 
is being rebuilt, and at this speed -- that we were able to 
shrug off the new conspiracy of the arrogant powers about the 
fall of the price of oil and go on our way, I see the secret in 
those strong pillars of society and in the alertness of our 
people. 
  One cannot help but admire a nation 30 percent of whose 
income is taken away from it, but it continues its programs as 
normal and does not declare a state of emergency. Despite all 
the propaganda and wicked plans to dishearten the people -- 
which one can sometimes hear from certain uninformed, or perhaps 
sincere, people inside the country -- the society continues on 
its course. 
  We are now in the construction period. Our main slogan is 
construction. The blow they intended to deal us was to close 
that road to us. During the war they blockaded us to prevent us 
from obtaining arms. Or they created havoc inside the country 
to disrupt our security. 
  In the construction period they intend to take away the 
tools 
of our construction, which is the budget. But they see today 
that they have come unstuck. [passage omitted] 
  The great big shock wave with which they had planned to 
bring 
us to our knees has passed over this society like a breeze, and 
if there is any delay in some of the work the society is so 
aware that it can understand well. [passage omitted] 
  I hope that the world of Islam fathoms clearly this correct 
direction of Iran's movement and that it finds its way, as our 
nation has, in Islam, the Koran, worship, contact with God, 
self-sacrifice and hard work. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Lamine Zeroual on the </F>
advent of 'Id al-Fitr; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Male and female citizens; on the occasion of the 
advent of 'Id al- Fitr it gives me pleasure to convey to you my 
most sincere greetings. 
  We ask that God may bring us to the next 'Id with prosperity 
and blessings and that he will inspire us with the wisdom and 
ability to serve the country and restore tranquillity and 
prosperity to our people, and security and stability to our 
country which is experiencing a difficult period in its history. 
  Brothers and sisters; I have had the opportunity to stress 
that Algeria is in need of all its faithful sons who are 
earnestly concerned for it and are eager to restore it to its 
true place among nations, and who do not spare themselves on its 
behalf. [passage omitted] 
  Thanks to these sacrifices the country will be victorious 
over its enemies who are criminals, traitors, and mercenaries. 
  On behalf of the state and in my own name, I express to them 
full and effective solidarity with them. I also express the 
solidarity of the state and its officials with the Armed Forces 
staff, the security men, and all the sections of society, the 
women and men who are still loyal to the covenant of 1 November 
1956 [outbreak of the armed revolution]. 
  Citizens, men and women; the month of Ramadan which is 
considered as one of the pillars of our holy religion has been 
spent by the Algerian people in difficult circumstances as a 
result of violence, and in the climate of an acute economic 
crisis. However, our people have been able to overcome these 
trials thanks to the strength of its faith, its love for its 
homeland, and attachment to its unity. The faith and 
determination of the Algerian people are the two pillars on 
which the action of the state is based in order to entrench a 
new era beneficial to all Algerians. 
  Brothers, sisters; I will continue work relentlessly and 
without any hesitation to reinforce the institutions of the 
state, restore security, and realize national concord and 
solidarity between all Algerians, and in order to undertake the 
reforms liable to revive the national economy. In this 
framework, we will also continue the fight against violence and 
criminality on the one hand, and promote serious dialogue with 
all the parties that respect the Constitution on the other, with 
a view to restoring stability to the country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn, March 14 (AFP) -- A total of 1,684 prisoners 
escaped in a mass break-out from jail in Algeria, a spokesman of 
the country's banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) told AFP in 
Germany Monday [14 March]. 
  Official Algerian sources had spoken of 900 prisoners 
escaping in Thursday's break-out from the Tazoult jail, located 
400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of Algiers, near Batna. 
  The prisoners escaped when a force of Islamic guerrillas 
stormed the jail at dusk just as the evening meal was being 
served. 
  According to the Front spokesman, all those who escaped were 
"political prisoners of the FIS rank-and-file". Four hundred 
were serving life sentences and 350 had been condemned to death 
by special courts, he said. 
  Other sources had earlier indicated that the escapees 
included some common criminals. 
  In Algiers, security forces said Monday they had killed 24 
and recaptured 79 of the prisoners. The hunt for the others was 
continuing and "a large amount of arms" had been found, they 
said. 
  According to the FIS spokesman, the authorities responded to 
the break-out by launching air-attacks using napalm in the 
western Aures region, to which the prisoners fled before 
"fanning out all over the country". 
  In Thursday's guerrilla attack against the Tazoult jail, one 
warder was killed, four were wounded and seven abducted, 
according to official Algerian sources. Two prison employees 
were accomplices, the Interior Ministry said. 
  The spokesman for the FIS abroad also said that at least 61 
members of the security forces had died in clashes with armed 
Islamic groups between February 28 and March 5, mainly in the 
Algiers region. 
  An earlier toll spoke of 187 killed in the period February 
13-28. 
  The FIS said 105 soldiers had been killed at the beginning 
of 
February in an ambush at Sidi Bel-Abes, south of Oran. 
  Moslem fundamentalists launched an armed insurgency against 
the Algerian authorities two years ago, after the cancellation 
of general elections which the fundamentalist FIS had been 
poised to win. 
  The Interior Ministry announced Monday that an overnight 
curfew imposed more than a year ago but eased during the Ramadan 
period would return to normal hours from Tuesday and run from 
midnight (2300 GMT) to 4:00 a.m. (0300 GMT). 
  During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day, only taking 
their 
first meal at nightfall, which is thus a moment of relaxation. 
That was the moment the assailants stormed the prison, FIS 
sources said.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Syria's View of Peace," 
AL-BA'TH says: During his meeting the day before yesterday with 
the 1948 Palestinians delegation, President Hafiz al-Asad 
reaffirmed Syria's view of a just and comprehensive peace. He 
also stressed that it was Syria which opened the doors to peace 
by accepting the U.S. initiative, on the basis of which the 
peace process started in Madrid. 
  The paper explains that Syria accepted the U.S. initiative 
because it was very clear and stipulated the implementation of 
UN resolutions, particularly 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace 
formula. 
  The paper says that in his speech the day before yesterday, 
President Hafiz al-Asad explained that Syria seriously wants 
peace, while Israel only speaks about peace without making one 
step in that direction. 
  The paper notes that the Washington talks have confirmed 
Syria's serious desire to achieve the just and comprehensive 
peace in the region. This was confirmed by the questions which 
Syria raises for discussion. Syria emphasizes the substance, 
while Israel avoids it. Israel always raises questions that are 
very far from the peace process and that run contrary to the 
endeavor to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria will accept nothing short of 
implementing the UN resolutions, on which the peace process is 
based. It also notes what President al-Asad has stressed; that 
world developments will not force us to relinquish any of our 
rights. 
  The paper says the world is now fully aware of the details 
of 
the Arab-Israeli conflict. Consequently, this world now knows 
very well who wants and works for the genuine peace and those 
who work against it. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH urges the world 
community 
to play its presumed role and compel Israel to implement UN 
resolutions out of concern for the world's peace and security 
and in order to entrench the principle of international 
legitimacy. 
  On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: As he does every time 
he speaks about peace, the peace process, and the obstacles 
blocking the realization of the objectives of that process, 
President Hafiz al-Asad explained that the peace which the Arabs 
and Syria want is the just peace that is based on the UN 
Security Council resolutions stipulating complete withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories and the return of the 
Palestinian Arab people's rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: This explanation, which President Hafiz 
al-Asad adds at this phase as a new confirmation of the firmness 
and clarity of Syria's position on the peace process, entails a 
specific message; the peace which Syria seeks is so clear that 
it does not need any explanation, as claimed by Israel, and that 
the obstacle facing the achievement of peace in the region lies 
in Israel's policy and positions. 
  The paper notes that despite the fact that the UN 
resolutions 
clearly stipulate that peace can be achieved through complete 
withdrawal, and despite the fact that the U.S. initiative was 
founded on this clear and logical explanation of the peace 
formula when it based the peace process and the achievement of 
its goals on the land-for-peace formula, the Israeli rulers 
still insist on specifying the meaning of the peace which Syria 
wants, although the world unanimously agrees that Syria's view 
of peace is fully compatible with the view of the international 
legitimacy. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes the innumerable pieces of evidence of 
Israel's rejection of peace, the most important of which can be 
seen in Israel's extortionist and impossible requests, in the 
studied aggressive escalation against Lebanon and its southern 
part, and in the programmed mass murders against the Palestinian 
Arab people. 
  AL-THAWRAH stresses that the peace which the Arabs want and 
agree on is, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, a 
comprehensive and complete peace. Unless peace is 
comprehensive, there can be no peace. 
  In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: When he states the 
Syrian position on the peace process and stresses that the kind 
of peace we want is the complete and comprehensive peace, the 
peace of the brave that would return the land and the 
Palestinian people's rights and guarantee that each party gets 
what is rightfully his without humiliating the other party, 
Leader al-Asad is stressing the constants, the principles, and 
the firmness that govern the Syrian policy, which cannot -- 
under any circumstance -- bargain over or relinquish a grain of 
soil or national right. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: He who thinks that we are fighting the 
battle for peace from a weak position is mistaken. Syria is 
strong enough and it still holds the reins of the initiative. 
Our position, as stressed by President Hafiz al-Asad, is very 
strong and gives us confidence and assurance. We are advocating 
our rights and the world developments will not force us to 
retreat. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: When the nation puts its 
weight behind Syria, it is because it realizes that the Syrian 
position, under the leadership of President al-Asad, expresses 
the Arab dignity and consciousness and is the only guarantee for 
the return of pan-Arab rights.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Sorrow and grief prevailed in the 
occupied Arab territories on the first day of the blessed 'Id 
al-Fitr, and hearts were filled with pain and bitterness. This 
is because Israel was not content with the horrible Hebron 
massacre; it added to the many killed worshipers, who were 
praying to God at the Ibrahimi Mosque, at least 30 other 
martyrs, who were killed by the Israeli army's bullets, in 
addition to hundreds of wounded. 
  Yesterday, Israel, using anti-tank rockets, destroyed a 
number of houses in Dayr al-Balah, deployed large military 
forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cities, closed Jerusalem, 
denied worshipers access to the places of worship, and turned 
the entire occupied homeland into a large battlefield. 
  Meanwhile, and out of persistence in provoking our kinsfolk 
under the hateful occupation, new groups of Zionist settlers 
have headed for Hebron. All this is taking in front of the 
international community and the Security Council which failed to 
condemn Israel and end its criminal acts that conflict with UN 
principles, the Geneva agreements, and human rights. 
  It is strange that some parties in the international 
community are talking and clamoring about human right violations 
in many countries while at the same time they are turning a 
blind eye to the Israelis' crimes and the serious Hebron 
massacre which claimed the lives of more than 50 innocent 
Palestinian citizens. 
  Therefore, it seems that the policy of double standards 
continues to be the prevailing practice. This arbitrary policy, 
however, cannot make a stable and secure world that would be 
kept away from wars and threats. It is sufficient for us to 
examine the UN reports, the testimonies of UN observers, and the 
resolutions passed by the Security Council and the UN General 
Assembly since 1947 to clearly sense that the Zionist military 
organizations -- and afterward Israel, which was recognized by 
many states in 1948 as an independent entity -- have committed 
disgraceful massacres and crimes. 
  Some 46 years have passed since Israel's establishment and 
incorporation into the United Nations. However, Israel still 
flagrantly violates the UN principles. A crystal-clear example 
of this was the Hebron Mosque massacre. But, has Israel ever 
been punished? Has the international community championed its 
own principles and the values of justice? In an attempt to 
justify the international community's inefficiency, the powerful 
western states in the Security Council have claimed that Arabs 
reject peace with Israel. More than two years have passed since 
the Madrid conference convened; the Washington talks have 
entered their third year; and the Arab delegations have 
continuously frequented Washington without any result. 
Moreover, Syria submitted a document of principles, which the 
entire world regarded as a historic event because it contained 
positive, constructive, and balanced proposals. Israel, 
however, rejected this document because it provides for 
exchanging land for peace. Israel wants land first, in addition 
to Arab recognition of Israel and the relinquishment of their 
own lands and rights. In other words, Israel wants to entrench 
occupation, usurpation, and the policy of expulsions and 
aggression as a consistent attitude in the Middle East. 
  The international community should have strongly and firmly 
intervened to impose a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. However, nothing has happened in this regard. This is 
because the international community has not yet gone beyond the 
phase of wishing that Israel would pursue the peace process. 
Everything is taking place as if Israel is above the 
international law and agreements. It is thus natural that the 
instincts of haughtiness and arrogance are overwhelming the 
Israeli rulers, so they reject peace, persist in the policy of 
killings, annihilation, and expulsions, and seriously pursue the 
policies of the old Nazis, knowing that these rulers have long 
claimed they were victims to Nazi policy. 
  The Middle East is still a powder keg. If this keg explodes, 
its repercussions will affect the region and the whole world. 
Now that the Middle East situation is serious, the United 
States has given priority to achieving a just and comprehensive 
solution on all fronts of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The United 
States made an initiative which the Arabs accepted. But Israel 
has not yet accepted it. Israel will definitely not comply with 
this initiative if the two cosponsors of the peace process, 
along with the international community, do not intervene to 
rectify matters and consecrate the Security Council's principles 
and resolutions as the only basis for a just and comprehensive 
solution. 
  The question posed is: When will the international community 
move and assume its responsibilities, knowing that the Hebron 
massacre was a rare opportunity for this council to impose its 
authority and consecrate its principles?

  [Text] TISHRIN speaks about the emotional speech President 
Hafiz al-Asad addressed to the masses of our people, in which he 
expressed thanks and gratitude for the sincere emotions they 
showed on the death of Basil. 
  TISHRIN Says: In his speech, President Hafiz al-Asad called 
for serious work in order to continue the march of construction 
and liberation within the framework of deep-rooted and effective 
national unity. President al-Asad said: There is a lot to be 
accomplished and immense responsibility to carry out. Let us 
continue our march, armed with faith in God, and let us redouble 
our efforts. The people who believed in God, unified 
themselves, and resolved to regain their rights will surely 
regain them. 
  TISHRIN emphasizes that while engaged in the battle for just 
and comprehensive peace, Syria should mobilize all its 
capabilities and potentials, whether in the field of internal 
construction or in the field of unifying the Arab position and 
urging Arab brothers to rise up to a viable position, especially 
since the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has shown it is 
impossible to speak about peace in the Middle East without 
ending Israeli occupation and dismantling Zionist settlements. 
  The concessions offered by the Palestinian side and the 
involvement of some Arabs in discussing means of regional 
cooperation increased Israel's arrogance and aggressiveness. 
Furthermore, Israel went as far as propagating that it is 
possible to make peace in the Middle East without Syria and 
Lebanon. 
  TISHRIN adds: Syria has repeatedly warned against deviating 
from Arab consensus and the principles of the peace process. 
Israel used the negotiations card with the Palestinian side in 
order to evade the peace requisites on the Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks. The result was a horrible massacre and more Israeli 
killing, sieges, and starving. At present, the occupied 
territories are subject to the ugliest forms of Zionist 
terrorism. 
  TISHRIN says this situation requires an all-out review of 
Arab policies in order to restore pan-Arab solidarity and 
continue the Arab boycott of Israel, until it accepts the 
principles of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East 
and returns the Golan, south Lebanon, and all occupied 
territories. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Syria, now and in the future, 
will continue to be the same -- no relinquishment of a grain of 
national soil or any of the nation's rights. Whether the 
negotiations continue for a long or a short time, the Syrian 
position will always be based on the aspirations of our Arab 
people and nation to restore the territories and the shrines, 
and build a shining future, away from the Israeli aggressive 
threats.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Before leaving for the United States, and in a new 
deceptive move, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin announced 
that two extremist settler organizations in the occupied 
territories had been banned. The criminal murderer Baruch 
Goldstein, who committed the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, belonged 
to one of these organizations. 
  In fact, this measure will not convince anyone. The Zionist 
settlers are still in the heart of Hebron provoking Arab 
citizens. They were joined a few days ago by more extremists. 
Rabin has refused to evacuate them from the city despite 
demands made by some Israeli ministers. He also refused to 
touch the settlements or discuss their future within the 
framework of the self-rule talks. What is even more serious is 
the fact that Rabin is still holding contacts with the Zionist 
extremist movement, Tzomet, to make it join the government. The 
leader of that movement, former General Rafa'el Etan, is well 
known for his racist tendencies, hatred against the Arabs, and 
calls for expelling them by force from their homes and annexing 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Israel. 
  Rabin's government should have taken measures to restore 
confidence to the Washington talks, such as announcing its 
readiness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in 
return for peace and taking decisive deterrent measures against 
the settlers. Israel has done nothing of the sort. The Israeli 
Government has only disarmed two settlers and has not uttered 
one word on the future of the occupied territories. 
  If we review recent events we can see the extent of the 
Israeli officials' deception. In only one month, more than 30 
people were killed by Israeli Army fire in the occupied 
territories. South Lebanon was the target of the most severe 
and savage land and air bombardment. As for the two Zionist 
organizations, Kakh and Kahana, whose activities were banned by 
Rabin, they have committed several crimes in the occupied 
territories in the past years. Rabin's ban is not different 
from his pledge not to use the U.S. loans for settlement 
activities. He allocated a large share of these loans -- some 
$500 million, according to the U.S. State Department -- to 
expand the settlements and arm the settlers and attract them 
with money and free housing to live in the occupied territories 
and terrorize the Arab citizens. 
  Restoring confidence to the Arab-Israeli talks can only be 
achieved through a public announcement by Rabin of his readiness 
to withdraw from the occupied territories and implement UN 
Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. Syria has 
always spoken about its readiness for a complete peace in return 
for a comprehensive withdrawal. Has Rabin, or any other Israeli 
official, uttered the words "complete peace?" The Arabs have 
not heard this yet. What they heard from the Israelis in 
Washington and outside Washington was an endless series of 
security pretexts, as if Israel's security can only be realized 
by murdering and humiliating Arabs, confiscating their land and 
property, and expelling them from their homes. 
  The Middle East peace has its basic prerequisites which 
cannot be tampered with or avoided, foremost of which is 
recognition of the Arab rights and withdrawal from the occupied 
territories. The Palestinian people have the right to enjoy 
freedom and dignity like all others peoples in the world. 
Lebanon also has the right to regain its southern part and its 
citizens in the south have the right to live a tranquil and 
peaceful life free from the daily Israeli bombardment. Syria 
has the right to regain the Golan Heights and the evacuees have 
the right to return to their homes and property. These are the 
conditions for peace. Certainly, there can be no peace without 
meeting these conditions. 
  Syria, along with all Arabs, is yearning for a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East that would allow regional 
states to develop their economic and developmental resources and 
provide prosperity and well-being to their peoples. Such a 
peace cannot be built while the Israeli threat is still 
standing, while the Israeli aggression continues, and while the 
Israeli expansionism drags out as a daily fact and a criminal 
practice. Peace runs counter to aggression, expansionism, and 
settlement activities. Aggression, expansionism, and settlement 
activities run counter to the principles of the world community.

  Awaiting a UN Security Council resolution and following 
world 
demand for an Israeli withdrawal and the implementation of the 
Geneva Conventions on the protection of civilians in time of 
war, the threats to peace, posed by the Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, have not gone away. Nor will the massacre lose its 
influence on the credibility of the UN Security Council, which 
is still holding consultations as if the massacre were less 
significant than Lockerbie or less vicious than the reasons that 
prompted UN troops to land in more than one capital of the 
post-Cold War world.

<F P=106> ["Barbs" column by Hanan Hamad: "Talbott's Repentance"] </F>
  [Text] Strobe Talbott has made up his mind, and decided to 
be both American and Israeli at the same time so he will not 
lose the opportunity to become the U.S. assistant secretary of 
state, and shortly replace Warren Christopher. He did so 
because he learned his lesson, and realized that swimming 
against the tide of the Jewish lobby in the U.S. Congress could 
put a spoke through his wheels and relegate him to the fate 
suffered by Admiral Inman, who paid a price for not allowing 
Israel to have access to Washington's military secrets 13 years 
ago. Because of this, Inman was compelled to ask that his 
nomination for the U.S. defense secretary position be withdrawn. 
Similarly, acting against the wishes of the Jewish lobby could 
also relegate Talbott to the fate of nominated Attorney General 
Janet Reno, who, all of a sudden, turned in the eyes of the U.S. 
press from a clever, trustworthy, and capable lady into a weak, 
vain, careless, and indifferent woman because she failed to 
recommend that Jewish spy Pollard be released or show a measure 
of mercy toward him. 
  Talbott has chosen to disavow a host of ideas he upheld in 
press articles published 13 years ago. In these articles, he 
condemned the forcible seizure of territories, and deemed 
necessary halting the domination of the Israeli civilian 
establishment by the Israeli military establishment. His 
rationale was that this would not only influence the future of 
Israel, but also turn it into a liability overburdening U.S. 
strategic interests in the Middle East and the world at large. 
  While being grilled by the Zionist lobby in the Congress 
during his confirmation hearings, Talbott showed wisdom. He 
made a turnabout, contending that most of the articles critical 
of Israel that he has written were published a long time ago, 
and that age has rendered him "wiser" than he was then. He 
added: I have always believed that U.S.-Israeli ties are 
unshakable. That my feelings regarding the strategic importance 
of Israel have changed is a certainty. He was not contented 
with disavowing his old ideas. He went further by saying that 
he has always believed that a strong Israel serves the interests 
of the United States, and that the latter should not apply any 
form of pressure on a country to which it is bound by special 
ties. He did not forget to pledge to refrain from any 
activities related to Israel once his nomination is confirmed. 
  It should be recalled that the campaign against Talbott was 
not designed to prevent him from taking the post. Otherwise, he 
would not have taken it in the first place. It was only a slap 
on the wrist, reminding him that he will remain under close 
watch throughout his tenure at the U.S. State Department. 
  Given all this, one would say that the executive director of 
AIPAC [the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee] put it 
right when he said that the Clinton administration was in his 
pocket, "even before it was formed." In light of all this, do 
we have the right to wonder as to the reasons for the 
procrastination over the passage of a UN Security Council 
resolution on the Hebron massacre, although there is a strong 
international consensus condemning this heinous massacre?

  [Text] Athens, March 14, IRNA -- "Kuwaiti-Iranian ties are 
more than good at this stage and the proof is that there is an 
open invitation by President Rafsanjani to the emir to visit 
Iran," Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir 
told Saudi weekly AL-MAJALLAH in an interview. Ahmad al-Jabir 
categorically denied reports that the detention of some Kuwaiti 
fishermen by Iranian coastal guards has dampened bilateral 
relations . 
  "I do not know from where you come with these false 
information," Ahmad al-Jabir replied to the AL-MAJALLAH 
correspondent when he alleged that Tehran-Kuwait relations are 
"disturbed" because of the arrest of "many" Kuwaiti fishermen by 
Iranian border guards. "Concerning the problem of the Kuwaiti 
fishermen and the detention of some of them by Iranian coastal 
guards, this is due to the interlocking of the territorial 
waters of the two countries. 
  "Officials of both countries are now taking practical steps 
to avoid such problems in the future which I do not think 
disturb the good and growing relations between the two countries 
and their two friendly peoples," the Kuwaiti foreign minister 
added. 
  In the interview published in last week's issue of the Arab 
magazine, Ahmad al-Jabir said Kuwait continues to support the 
just struggle of the Palestinian people "despite the position of 
its leadership."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ahmad Hamud by Khalid </F>
al-Mash'an "during a dinner banquet at his residence" on 6 March] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Al-Mash'an] An international 
newspaper published the photo of a Kuwaiti citizen, who was 
arrested in Iraq on charges of espionage against Iraq. Has this 
citizen been identified? And what is your response to Iraq's 
accusation that this citizen was sent by the Kuwaiti 
Intelligence Service? 
  [Hamud] The Iraqi regime has always tried to hamper any 
progress in Kuwait. It has always tried to tarnish Kuwait's 
image in front of the international community. I believe this 
story was fabricated by the Iraqi media, which has experience in 
such fabrications. 
  We will not try to identify this person because he might be 
an Iraqi who was wearing a Kuwait dress and claimed to be a 
Kuwaiti citizen. The Iraqi regime is used to such farces. This 
person might have also been in Kuwait before the invasion and 
the Iraqi regime is now claiming that he works for Kuwaiti 
Intelligence. 
  The Iraqi regime is known for these fabrications. I believe 
that if there were Nobel prizes for media fabrications the Iraqi 
regime would be the winner. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Mash'an] There have been reports that another trench 
will 
be dug on the northern border. What is the purpose of this? 
  [Hamud] A plan has been set to build a security wall. One of 
its phases is to dig the trench. Once the digging of the trench 
is completed we will embark on the second phase, etc., until we 
finish the three-phase plan. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Mash'an] When will the Central Committee begin to study 
the status of the al-Bidun [stateless persons]? Did the 
committee create a plan to solve this problem? 
  [Hamud] The Central Committee is working to set up its 
headquarters and to recruit employees. After the 'Id, I will 
meet with the Central Committee to create a plan, lay its 
foundations, and begin the committee's working plan. 
  The committee will then announce the steps it will follow in 
its work. It will also explain the way to submit applications 
to this committee. 
  I would like to settle this issue as soon as possible. I am 
confident that the brothers who were consulted and who agreed to 
be members of the committee will do their utmost. We wish them 
success in their work to solve this problem. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan al-Lughani] </F>
  [Text] The ministers of defense and health have stated that 
Kuwait, in the aftermath of the Kuwait liberation war, is free 
of any abnormal diseases. 
  This came in remarks made after taking part in a meeting of 
the Environment Committee of the National Assembly. Minister of 
Defense Shaykh 'Ali Sabah al-Salim has dismissed as utterly 
groundless foreign press reports, as carried in local press, 
that chemical materials were used in the war for the liberation 
of Kuwait. He regretted that the press has carried such news 
reports, which only aim to shake the citizens' confidence and 
make them believe that the earth and climate in our country are 
polluted with bacteriological germs. This is untrue, he noted. 
  In a related development, Minister of Health Dr. 
'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Fawzan, who, along with several Health 
Ministry officials, took part in the meeting, has stated that 
official statistics and studies conducted in the country are 
reassuring. These statistics and studies showed that the 
figures for birth deformities, miscarriages, cancer, and 
dermatological diseases reported before the Iraqi invasion of 
the country remained unchanged in the aftermath of this invasion. 
  The minister added that the amount of radiation in the 
atmosphere in the State of Kuwait is within normal ranges. He 
went on to say that the reported infection of some U.S. troops 
serving in the Gulf with a certain disease was caused by a skin 
rash precipitated by cutaneous leishmaniasis and the so-called 
oriental sore. This, in turn, was caused by sandflies, which 
are very common in the Arabian Peninsula and Iran. These 
infections are limited and natural, the health minister noted. 
  Dr. al-Fawzan maintained that the ministry does not agree 
with the reports published in newspapers in this regard. The 
ministry regards such reports as unreliable. The ministry only 
trusts the WHO releases, which have dismissed as groundless 
reports that abnormal diseases surfaced in Kuwait in the 
aftermath of the liberation war. He added that the WHO had 
taken part in several of the studies the Health Ministry 
conducted in Kuwait. 
  The minister noted that the local news media must play a 
great role in enlightening citizens and assuring them about the 
health situation in the country. These media must also contact 
Ministry of Health officials when they receive any pertinent 
reports from foreign sources, he added. 
  For his part, Dr. Nasir Sirkhuh, rapporteur of the 
Environment Committee of the National Assembly, said that the 
committee raised this issue with the Ministry of Defense and the 
Ministry of Health after international news reports surfaced 
that some strange diseases spread in the region in the aftermath 
of the Kuwait liberation war, and that U.S. troops caught these 
diseases. He added that meetings with officials of the two 
ministries confirmed that these press reports are groundless, 
and that the health situation in the country is sound. Contrary 
to these reports, he noted, statistics have shown an improvement 
in many areas of the health situation in Kuwait, compared to the 
situation before the occupation. 
  Dr. Sirkhuh concluded by saying that he is not aware of the 
motives behind these tendentious press reports.

<F P=106> [First installment of interview with former Prime Minister </F>
General Michel 'Awn by Bisharah Shirbil in France; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shirbil] Numerous developments have taken 
place in Lebanon and the region since the liberation war: An 
authority formed as a result of the al-Ta'if accord has 
strengthened, governments have been formed, elections have been 
held, and a treaty has been concluded with Syria, which is 
responsible for Lebanon's future if it enters the peace process, 
as it defines the future features of the region. How do you 
view Lebanon's position? 
  ['Awn] Lebanon does not exist. Lebanon today represents a 
differential in the Syrian-Israeli equation. It has surrendered 
itself to Syria and can no longer sign or reject anything. It 
is completely silent. The Lebanese negotiator's position has 
been humanly disgraceful, standing like a dummy in front of the 
Israeli negotiator. It cannot discuss anything, or say yes or 
no. So it has become the object of ridicule. The proper thing 
is for the Lebanese to suspend their participation in the 
negotiations so that Syrian negotiations can advance. It is not 
a vacation in Washington. Let them wait for Damascus' signal to 
return. I say that Lebanon's participation does not mean it 
exists. It only exists as a differential variable between the 
Syrian view and Israeli view of Lebanon. It is regrettable for 
us to become a margin in an equation, not a personality in its 
own right. This is what I meant before when I said that we 
should sit at -- not on -- the negotiating table [as published], 
and I called for a three-sided, not two-sided table, that is a 
table at which Lebanon, Syria, and Israel would sit and through 
which Lebanon could talk about its right. [passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] You reject what you call Syrian occupation of 
Lebanon and yet accept what the Arabs consider Jewish occupation 
of Palestine. 
  ['Awn] No. I reject the Israeli occupation. But is the Jew 
present in Israel not entitled to set up his entity or not? Is 
Palestine not his territory or not? Your will tell me that he 
is an immigrant and a stranger. But I ask you: When have human 
societies ever been fixed? Are there not ten times more Arabs 
in the United States than Israelis in Palestine? Here, in 
France, there are some 3 million people of Algerian origin. 
Human societies are not fixed ethnically or religiously. 
  [Shirbil] But ethnic and Arab communities in France or the 
United States do not set up separate entities hostile toward 
their environment. 
  ['Awn] Yes, there are entities causing problems. But their 
members enjoy the civil and political rights enjoyed by the 
Americans or the French. There is no discrimination in the law. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] What is your expectation as regards the future of 
fundamentalism? 
  ['Awn] It will inevitably come to power in Islamic states, 
but it will fall after reaching power. Then a reexamination 
will be conducted from within Islam. 
  [Shirbil] Did you hope that fundamentalism would assume 
power in Algeria? 
  ['Awn] I do not wish that to happen, but they will come to 
power. It is a natural, historic rule. It has nothing to do 
with whether or not I wish that to happen. I am not a 
fundamentalist, and I reject fundamentalism openly. However, I 
expect them to come to power. Then they will fail because they 
make many promises of solutions to the problems. But they are 
primitive solutions which will complicate difficult problems. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] How can the fundamentalist tendencies which you 
expect to come to power influence Lebanon? 
  ['Awn] We are in the region, and certainly fundamentalism 
will influence Lebanon. We have people who support 
fundamentalism and consider it a hope for a reasonable solution. 
  [Shirbil] You cannot say that there is a sweeping 
fundamentalist tendency in Lebanon. It is one of the parties... 
  ['Awn] Lebanon is disorganized demographically. There is 
horrific population growth. A sizable proportion of Lebanese 
used to emigrate, but this is not possible now. The Lebanese 
abroad cannot find jobs, and they want to return to Lebanon. 
Western societies are full of unemployed people. France has 4 
million of them, and the United States 23 million. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shirbil] Can the growing fundamentalist tide lead to a 
coexistence crisis in Lebanon, or does the crisis already exist? 
  ['Awn] A coexistence crisis exists in most pluralistic 
societies. But when there is a national authority and dialogue 
over the issue, problems will be solved. It is always possible 
to find solutions for them. But what happened in Lebanon was 
that, as a result of existing pressures caused by coexistence 
and pluralism, some external parties intervened and stability 
was undermined and Lebanon taken over by Syria. This is in 
addition to the Israeli occupation in the south. Every occupier 
says the other occupier is the cause of its presence. But both 
are occupiers: an enemy occupation and a brotherly occupation, 
as they say. Their effects on citizens are the same. There is 
social pressure in a country that is pluralistic ethnically, 
religiously, and culturally. Anyone who says otherwise is lying 
to himself. Freedom and equality are the foundation of the 
relationship among the Lebanese. Equality should be through 
opportunities, not rights, because rights necessitate justice, 
and justice necessitates distinguishing between people: 
everyone should be rewarded on the basis of his competence. 
[sentence as published] 
  If a section of the Lebanese does not accept that, a 
referendum should be held -- a referendum on political ideas. 
So if the idea is accepted, it should be accepted with all its 
results. And if it is rejected, it should be rejected with all 
its results. On that basis, if unification is not accepted on 
the basis of a constitution, equality, and everyone's rights and 
duties, federalism becomes a solution. [passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] The events witnessed in pluralistic states that 
include sectarian and ethnic... 
  ['Awn, interrupting] Let us talk freely and very openly. The 
ball of unification is in the Lebanese Muslims' court. If they 
have any courage, let them embark on unification within not 
'Awn's concepts but universal concepts, because these concepts 
are not mine. 
  [Shirbil] As though your plan is outside... 
  ['Awn] Let them adopt the Bosnia plan. 
  [Shirbil] Which is? 
  ['Awn] A federation and a confederation like the one signed 
between the Croats and the Bosnians. This or that. 
  [Shirbil] Is there anything else which you consider amiss? 
  ['Awn] The present situation is not under control. There 
are no state structures to exercise powers and assume 
responsibilities at all levels. Because the state is based on 
excesses. The head of state said that General 'Awn left Lebanon 
following an agreement with him and with several other parties. 
Do you imagine that they hit me by aircraft under an agreement 
with me. And that they stripped me of my rights in the military 
establishment under an agreement with me. [passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] Do you support the resistance against the Israeli 
occupation in the south? 
  ['Awn] I support the resistance in every sense of the word. 
However, I would to explain one point: At the negotiations held 
in Washington Israel clearly announced that it does not want a 
single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of water in return 
for border security. Israel says that it wants to withdraw in 
return for border security and joining the peace process, which 
is supported by the Arab states and on the basis of which they 
are negotiating. So why the resistance now? I should ask this 
resistance about its links. You should not ask me whether or 
not I support the resistance. The continuation of the 
resistance forced Israel to stay and forced the parties using 
Israel's presence as an excuse to stay. If Syria's value 
increases as a result of the resistance, who is going to pay the 
price? Will Israel pay Syria from Israel, or will the 
resistance pay the price if a solution is secured? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shirbil] Has anyone invited you to return to Lebanon? 
  ['Awn] There are numerous offers. There are open 
invitations from Nabih Birri, Eilie al-Farzali, and Eilie 
Hubayqah. 
  [Shirbil] Do you believe your security is not guaranteed? 
  ['Awn] Nothing is guaranteed in Lebanon. Tell me any major 
crime whose clues have been unraveled. 
  [Shirbil] Will your remain as an oppositionist... 
  ['Awn] More than an oppositionist. I am not an 
oppositionist. I am a resister. Oppositionists recognize the 
regime and oppose it. I do not recognize the present regime, 
which is why I am resisting. Resistance does not necessarily 
mean carrying a gun. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Second and final installment of interview with former Prime </F>
Minister Gen. Michel 'Awn by Bisharah Shirbil in France; date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shirbil] How does General 'Awn feel five years 
after the liberation war? And has his assessment of the bitter 
experience the Lebanese went through changed? What has changed 
since that war? 
  ['Awn] Without doubt, the atmosphere of the general crisis 
Lebanon went through has not changed. However, big changes have 
occurred inside the Lebanese people, in their awareness of the 
problem and view of the future, that is if they can participate 
in achieving this future. They can now determine their choices 
clearly, whether inside the country, with neighbors, or with the 
world. This view is now very clear, because the liberation war 
has removed all the masks from the faces of regional and 
international players and accentuated the realities through the 
experience which the Lebanese people witnessed after 13 October 
1990. There are no longer false slogans that can be sanctioned 
in Lebanon, nor international stances that deceive citizens. 
The Lebanese now know when a major international authority is 
lying and when he is telling the truth. They can tell whether a 
regional authority is really an enemy of their traditional enemy 
or a friend of his, pretending to be their friend merely to 
implement certain schemes. The Lebanese people are now very 
vigilant, and their experience -- however harsh -- is useful 
with regard to future choices. [passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] Are you preparing for a new liberation war? 
Assuming you arrived in Lebanon now, would you launch a new 
liberation war? 
  ['Awn] The situation is different now. We are in a pressing 
regional situation. Lebanon is occupied. Elements should be 
different.... 
  [Shirbil] As resistance is the principle, if you consider 
Lebanon occupied, then a new liberation war is a natural 
outcome.... 
  ['Awn] Of course. But that depends on the balance of power. 
Lebanon is now in an unstable position, but this position does 
not prompt armed resistance, because there is regional and 
international pressure on the region. They do not want anything 
to sabotage the peace process. Lebanon has now been handed over 
to others, and I am out of the game. [passage omitted] 
  [Shirbil] Are there any political messages between you and 
the Syrians? 
  ['Awn] Many of the visitors who deal with them offer me 
plans which I consider imperialist. And I conclude from them 
that the Syrians still have the mentality of the seventies. 
  [Shirbil] Did anyone bring you a real offer? 
  ['Awn] I received many offers, but I do not believe they are 
serious as long as there are no direct contacts between me and 
them. 
  [Shirbil] Are you willing to deal with the Syrians if they 
open up to you? 
  ['Awn] On one condition: One thing is not negotiable 
between me and them, and that is Lebanon's independence and 
sovereignty. Anything else can be discussed. The sovereignty 
and independence condition cannot be subject to interpretation. 
  [Shirbil] Those who support the Syrians in Lebanon say that 
the Syrian presence secures sovereignty and independence... 
  ['Awn] Many people talk about modesty when they are 
themselves naked. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A pro-Vatican magazine has quoted a Vatican diplomat 
as saying that there is a possibility that the bombing of the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church [on 27 February] was perpetrated to 
protest the establishment of diplomatic relations between the 
Vatican and Israel. The Vatican diplomat revealed that the Holy 
See received signals in December that an attack against a 
Christian target in the Middle East was inevitable. He added: 
We feared attacks against Christian targets in the Middle East. 
He noted that the earliest signs of such a possibility emerged 
around Christmas, when the agreement between the Vatican and the 
State of Israel was signed.

  [Excerpt] SLA [South Lebanese Army] soldiers captured a lot 
of equipment in a pre-dawn clash with Popular Front terrorists, 
in which two were killed and two captured. The commander of the 
area said the weapons included grenades and explosive charges. 
They also had leaflets saying they had come to avenge the 
Hebron massacre. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT 
on 12 March adds that "the leaflets also specified terms of 
negotiations, in which the terrorists had planned to involve the 
French ambassador in Israel."] 
  The commander added that there had been an increase of 
terrorist activity in south Lebanon, and the wave of terror had 
reached its peak. 
  The gang was on its way to an attack on one of the northern 
border settlements. SLA soldiers noticed the band near Har Dov. 
In an initial clash, one terrorist was wounded and captured and 
three others escaped. Later, one of them surrendered to UNIFIL 
[UN Interim Force in Lebanon]. The other two were killed after 
a chase. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "So That They May Not Stand Alone in </F>
the Open"] 
  [Excerpts] Despite the abundant Arab blood that was 
unjustly shed by Israelis in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque Square in 
Hebron in Ramadan; despite the ugly, revolting, and cowardly act 
committed by an Israeli who bears U.S. nationality accompanied 
by a group of killer settlers under cover of the Israeli Defense 
Forces; despite the cosmetic attempts and deception in which the 
Israeli prime minister is proficient, such as releasing a few 
hundred detainees and disarming some settlers; and despite the 
whole world's condemnation of the crime and criminals, we 
reiterate and affirm -- backed by historical evidence and the 
history of Israel, its rulers, institutions, and people--that 
Israeli violence inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is not the first 
and will not be the last. Israeli society, which was implanted 
inside the live Palestinian flesh, has shown the unique ability 
to spawn, foster, and protect terrorism. We do not exaggerate 
when we say that Israeli extremism was fostered in the lap of 
the military establishment and in the settlement institution 
itself, which views the entire Palestinian territory as the 
natural right of every Israeli. [passage omitted] 
  Slaughterer Baruch Goldstein, the killer of Muslims at 
prayer 
in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, who bears dual Israeli-U.S. 
citizenship; and before him Former Israeli Prime Minister 
Menahem Begin, the champion of the Dayr Yasin massacre; former 
Israeli Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon, champion of the Sabra 
and Shatila massacres; Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who 
advocated breaking the bones of the intifadah heroes, whose 
hands are dripping with the blood of innocent Palestinians; and 
dozens of generals and leaders, who committed massacres against 
defenseless Palestinians, are calling on the Arabs to turn over 
a new leaf and salvage the peace process, as if peace can only 
be achieved with the corpses of Arabs and Palestinians. 
  We will never be content with a Security Council meeting and 
passing resolutions condemning the massacre, because this would 
be mere ink on paper. The situation now requires an overall 
Arab assessment of all developments from the Oslo agreement to 
the Cairo agreement in order to define our path. In other 
words, we do not want to leave the Palestinians alone to face 
this ordeal. Whether we like it or not, the Palestinian issue 
will remain primarily an Egyptian issue and an Arab issue that 
affects pan-Arab security. We do not want to leave the 
Palestinian negotiator alone in the open to face killers, 
executioners, and the schemes of the Israelis who claim to seek 
peace. 
  Since all Arab countries have condemned and denounced the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and since all Arab governments have 
defined their position on the planned Israeli terrorism, and 
since all Arab regimes have agreed that the crux of the problem 
is due to the existence of the armed Israeli settlements and the 
lack of protection for the Palestinian people, we do not want to 
leave Yasir 'Arafat to stand alone to face the plotting and to 
declare the continued suspension of the negotiations. There 
will be no solution. A real solution lies in a call by the Arab 
League for an emergency meeting of the Arab foreign ministers to 
be held urgently at the Arab League or in any Arab capital, to 
agree on a unified Arab stance on negotiations and the peace 
process. 
  Israel continues to build settlements and to arm settlers 
and 
to distribute arms on a large scale inside the West Bank and the 
Gaza Strip in preparation for a civil war after implementing the 
self-rule agreement. It is a time bomb that Israel has planted 
to go off at a certain moment. We are not exaggerating when we 
say that Israel itself is a real threat to Arab security. It 
poses a threat to the entire Arab region. The Israeli society 
poses a constant threat to the Palestinian people. Despite 
this, Israel negotiates and says in a loud voice that its 
security is threatened and that it wants the Oslo agreement and 
the Cairo agreement to guarantee its security. Such an 
opportunistic stance will prevent genuine peace with Israel. 
  We are in dire need of a new Arab will, new approach, and 
new 
peace that fulfills all Arab rights. The peace that we seek 
means withdrawal, dismantling of the settlements, departure of 
the settlers, and granting the Palestinian people the right to 
determine their future and establish their state. There is a 
dire need for a new Arab decision that will put things right and 
not leave the Palestinian negotiator alone in the open while we 
continue to repeat statements of condemnation and denunciation.

  [Text] The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH, in its editorial today, 
comments on President Husni Mubarak's interview with the 
Lebanese magazine AL-HAWADITH. Under the headline "The New 
Chaotic Order," the paper notes that President Mubarak described 
the new international order as a new chaotic order. 
  The newspaper writes: What we see in today's world is chaos, 
not order. What is happening in Russia, the former Eastern 
bloc, Iran, Afghanistan, and Bosnia-Herzegovina demonstrate the 
traits of this new international order. The new order is 
characterized by chaos, wars, and genocide perpetrated by the 
big powers against downtrodden nations, particularly the Muslim 
ones. Muslim people have suffered terribly under the new order. 
This is true in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
and the Islamic republics that were part of the former Soviet 
Union.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Tripoli, 14 Mar -- The Voice of America broadcasted 
yesterday a commentary that reflects the views of the U.S. 
Government. 
  As is customary, the commentary accused the Great Jamhiriyah 
of supporting what it termed as terrorism and spoke about what 
it termed as sanctions against Libya, which where imposed by the 
UN Security Council on the Great Jamahiriyah. 
  The commentary said: America will seek to impose other 
sanctions, including an embargo on Libyan oil. 
  The JANA Arab affairs editor has responded to that saying: 
  These remarks, which American officials have grown 
accustomed 
to reiterating, affirm that their originators are shameless. 
One even doubts if they really belong to the human kind. 
Otherwise, had they a little bit of shame, they would have kept 
quiet and refrained from repeating the talk about terrorism and 
official terrorism after what they have done in the al-Ibrahimi 
mosque, killing worshippers while prostrating for God. 
  We may ask here what is behind these remarks. Are those who 
made it trying to cover the Sun with a mesh when they pour their 
irresponsible accusation against Libya, claiming that there are 
Libyans accused of opening fire on American Embassy officials in 
Sudan and Yemen, of murdering American and British hostages, of 
launching an attack on a British air base in Cyprus, of 
hijacking an American plane in Pakistan, and of planting 
explosives in a Jewish synagogue. 
  The American Government is trying to cover up the fresh 
scandal in the Security Council, which was, as a result of the 
American position, incapable of issuing a resolution condemning 
Israel of terrorism for killing tens of praying Palestinians 
inside the holy al-Ibrahimi mosque two weeks after that savage 
massacre. Was not America's position in the Security Council 
based on terrorism, and was there not more official terrorism 
when America affirms before the entire world that it supports 
the perpetrators of the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre, protects 
them, and prevents international condemnation of them? Was not 
that an encouragement to those terrorists to commit more of 
these massacres? And then what can we call America's arming of 
doctors with machine guns and encouraging them to commit 
collective massacres against the Palestinians? Is not that 
terrorism? 
  But to make threats, in accordance with the American 
official's assertions in his statement, on the need to impose 
trade and oil embargo on Libya, would only make us, the Libyans, 
scornful, because we believe in ourselves and we are proud of 
our free will and our sovereign decision, which are not the 
subject of any blackmail. It is, furthermore, a stance that 
would make us reiterate with clarity that we do not need you; we 
do not need your industries or your business; we do not need to 
sell our oil to you or to Europe, which is under your sphere of 
influence. 
  We no longer need your equipment to market our oil, and 
moreover, we wish the day when we have no oil would come, 
because once we get ourselves rid of oil the better we are, as 
there would no longer be anything to threaten us with. And who 
said that we have been seeking to forge an economic cooperation 
with you? What kind of cooperation can be established with an 
enemy? What has been separating us is barriers and a sea of 
blood for centuries. 
  History has thus spoken and facts have thus affirmed. 
However, what you should bear always in mind when you were 
making such statements is the fact that you are dealing with a 
people that has divorced fear; nothing will ever frighten it 
save losing its freedom and dignity, which it will defend until 
the last man. 
  Hence, we look forward to the moment when you would deprive 
us once and for all from what you have called "our sophisticated 
equipment," to the moment when we get ourselves rid of industry 
and oil and of everything else you have been trying to use as a 
means to shackle us. Because only then we can deal with you in 
a way that would remind you of what the Vietnamese people had 
done to you when routing you and the Red Army, which you were 
never sure from where it was going to hit you again, and the 
IRA, whose members you have called terrorists and accused us of 
helping terrorism when we had contacts with them at a time His 
Majesty's government [as received] was holding secret meetings 
and negotiations with them. This army closed Great Britain's 
airport for 48 hours under its blows. You will taste something 
even more bitter than what was done to you by Aidid, who forced 
you to escape from Somalia after inflicting shame and disgrace 
on your forces because he has nothing to lose and because you 
yourselves have turned him into a guerrilla, relentless in 
confronting you and attacking your forces. 
  It has become clear that you are incapable of protecting 
your 
citizens and tourists, who are falling everywhere, because the 
ones who are fighting you are ghosts you do not know and who 
appear from nowhere and deal you [word indistinct]. They are 
not a regular army or a state or a government. For this reason 
we wish that we too turn into ghosts, and we are sure that you 
are going down that path. That will be the time to turn the 
world on your heads, and our slogan in this confrontation will 
be: On me and on my enemies. We will fight according to this 
slogan's spirit anywhere and from any spot. Then you will not 
be able to threaten us or hit us with your aircraft and atomic 
bombs because we got rid of everything that makes us prisoners 
to your threats and, thanks to you, we turned into giants, 
ghosts, and guerrillas. You will not find us as anything other 
than fighters wherever you show your faces. 
  There is enough in this to warn you against the consequences 
of continuing to level irresponsible accusations and attacks 
against us and to seek sham justifications with references to 
international laws. It is you who violate international law and 
trample under foot and violate international conventions in 
front of the world. You are using state terrorism as a method in 
international dealings, and you support, protect, and pardon 
terrorists and pardon yourselves from punishment and from 
chapter 7 of the UN charter. You are dominating the Security 
Council and using it as a sword hanging over the heads of the 
peoples that reject submission to your blackmail. You issue on 
its behalf false resolutions against them, resolutions we do not 
recognize, just as we do not recognize the Security Council. 
  What respect to international conventions are you calling 
for? And when you ask Libya to hand over to you its two 
citizens, do you respect the Montreal convention, which clearly 
says any signatory state has the right to carry out the 
necessary measures to impose its own judicial provisions 
concerning the crimes pertaining to civil aviation when the 
accused is in its territory and it has not handed him over. The 
convention also gives the signatory states, including the Great 
Jamahiriyah, naturally the right to take its own national 
judicial measures to impose its own jurisdiction in the case 
where the accused is in the territory of the state on whose 
territory the crime was not committed, and where the airplane 
was not registered, and when it has not handed him over either 
to the state where the crime was committed or to the state 
handing over the plane [sentence as received]. 
  Therefore, the two Libyan citizens whom you are accusing are 
in their own country where they should be tried according to its 
own national jurisdiction and not in any other country, 
according to the Montreal convention. What legal logic are you 
going to use to meet this convention, barring falsification and 
forgery, and [indistinct word] international law and trampling 
it under foot?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dev Prakash] </F>
  [Text] In violation of the spirit of bilateralism, 
good-neighborliness and the Simla Agreement, Pakistan has been 
mounting an assault on India at the international forums on the 
so-called violation of human rights in J and K [Jammu and 
Kashmir] and Punjab. Pakistan has been pampered by the 
uncalled-for statements based on half-truth by President Clinton 
and other officials of the USA. Suffering from innate sense of 
political insecurity pretending to rule with the help of ISI 
[Inter Service Intelligence], Ms. Bhutto seems to have lost all 
[word indistinct] bearing and composure. [sentence as heard] 
She is suffering from the illusion that she can annex Kashmir, 
it being a Muslim-majority border state, or by championing the 
cause of Muslims in Kashmir she can seek leadership of the 
Islamic world. She has not only forgotten that millions of 
people in her own country are deprived of fundamental freedom 
and basic human rights, but also that she is losing support all 
over the world by deporting terrorism to India and other 
neighboring countries. 
  To expose Pakistan's false propaganda against India on human 
rights violation, India as of late allowed nongovernmental 
organizations, individuals, and envoys of various countries to 
see for themselves the condition in J and K. This has helped 
India in enhancing its credibility at the international forums. 
Innocent people are being butchered by Pakistan-trained 
extremists in the valley. Thousands of foreign mercenaries, 
especially Afghans, are attacking Indian security forces before 
mingling with masses at crowded places to avoid retaliation. 
And if in retaliation any civilian is killed in cross-fire, 
Indian forces are blamed for violating human rights. 
  Delhi-based ambassadors and high commissioners of 10 Western 
and Islamic countries visited J and K last week and met leaders 
of Hurriet Conference at the residence of their leader, Mirwaiz 
Umar Farooq, who was there with their leaders like Maulvi 
Ansari, Qazi Abdullah, Professor Ghani and Javed Ahmad. The 
envoy's team also met among others acting president of the JKLF 
[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]; human rights commission 
officials; and [Kashmir] Governor, General, retired, K.V. 
Krishna Rao. These diplomats from Bulgaria, Hungary, Nigeria, 
Senegal, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and 
Canada have met people holding all shades of opinion and have 
realized the role played by Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. The 
reaction proves the success of the center's federal government's 
new policy to open up Kashmir and invite the envoys to visit it. 
  The separatists would not have to adjust [as heard] to the 
fact that the other side of the story would also get 
international exposure. Only last month, ambassadors of 
Belgium, Greece and Germany had visited Kashmir to assess the 
situation for themselves. India has also invited the member 
countries of the ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] to send 
their envoys to the state. It has permitted the International 
Committee of the Red Cross to send a team to the state and is 
currently negotiating with Amnesty International too which is 
keen in visiting the valley. Earlier, U.S. secretary of state 
[title as heard], Ms. Robin [Raphel], had paid a visit on her 
own to the valley. The misunderstanding and falsehood spread by 
the Pakistani lobby is gradually being cleared up and there is 
now a greater appreciation of the Indian position that it is the 
victim of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. 
  On the basis of Vienna Declaration, the UN Human Rights 
Commission on 4 March adopted a resolution condemning terrorism 
and calling upon the international community to fight the menace 
at the national, regional, and international levels. It also 
expressed concern at the gross violation of human rights by 
terrorist groups by saying that it cannot be justified under any 
circumstances. It is a big blow to Pakistan which is spreading 
fundamentalism in various countries. 
  In Kashmir, Pakistan has tried to create religious cleavages 
and divide. It has resulted in the ethnic cleansing and 
large-scale displacement of people. Efforts are being made to 
change the demographic profile of the Kashmir Valley. Coming to 
Pakistan's own record of human rights, the latest reports of 
Asia Watch and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan are 
eye-openers as they have accused the Pakistani Government of 
severe abuse of human rights of minorities and women in 
particular.

<F P=106> [Report by Surinder Oberoi] </F>
  [Text] Srinagar, India, March 12 (AFP) -- Javed Mir, the 
president of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and 
most-wanted Kashmiri Moslem militant, was arrested here Saturday 
[12 March], witnesses and JKLF sources said. 
  Mir, 30, the former commander-in-chief of the guerrilla wing 
of the Moslem separatist group, was arrested along with another 
man when the car in which they were travelling was stopped by 
border guards, the witnesses said. 
  The pair were pulled out of the car and whisked away by the 
Indian paramilitary troops, they said. The other man, whose 
identity was not immediately known, was later released. 
  JKLF sources here confirmed the arrest of the JKLF president 
but there was no immediate word from the Indian authorities. 
  The stocky and bearded Mir was one of the four founders of 
the Moslem separatist rebellion which began in India's only 
Moslem-majority state in 1989 and his arrest is seen as a major 
setback to the movement. 
  Of the other three architects of the armed struggle against 
Indian rule, two are dead and the third is in prison. Mir, who 
worked for the state waterworks department before picking up a 
gun, carried a reward of 50,000 rupees (1,666 dollars) on his 
head and topped the list of Kashmiri Moslem militants wanted by 
the Indian authorities. 
  A native of Sringar, Mir has been accused by the Indian 
authorities of singlehandedly carrying out several deadly 
attacks against Indian troops deployed in the northern state. 
  The outlawed JKLF is the second most powerful Moslem 
separatist organization in Kashmir after the Hizbul Mujahedeen, 
which favors a merger of the state with Pakistan. 
  Unlike the Hizbul and most other groups, the JKLF seeks 
independence for the Himalayan territory. 
  Mir is the third top leader of the JKLF to be arrested in 
the 
past fortnight and his arrest comes just a day after he made a 
surprise appearance at the main mosque in Srinagar to deliver a 
speech from the pulpit. 
  Last week, Mir was among a group of Kashmiri Moslem leaders 
who met here with a team of 10 New Delhi-based diplomats who 
toured the strife-torn state. 
  More than 8,000 people have died in Moslem-separatist 
related 
violence in Kashmir since 1989. 
  India, which holds the southern two-thirds of Kashmir, 
accuses Pakistan, which controls the northern third, of arming 
and training the militants waging the fight against India rule. 
  Pakistan denies the charge but provides diplomatic support 
to 
a campaign which it describes as a legitimate struggle for 
self-determination.

  [Text] Direct involvement of Pakistani nationals and Afghan 
mojahedin into Kashmir militancy and taking over command of 
terrorist leadership to step up subversive activities in Kashmir 
Valley have been established with the arrest of several foreign 
mercenaries and nationals of Pakistan. This came to light 
recently when an advertisement in a local Urdu daily of Srinagar 
gave the list of foreign mercenaries belonging to its outfit 
killed in Kashmir in encounters with the security forces. 
According to the newspaper, of the list of 35 such mercenaries, 
at least 27 were Pakistanis, three from Afghanistan, two from 
Saudi Arabia, and one each from Bahrain and Algeria. 
  The Border Security Force [BSF] today found 10 bags of 
foreign currency worth crores of rupees from the Regal area in 
Samba Sector of Jammu region. A BSF spokesman told PTI the 
currency notes of countries like Pakistan, United Kingdom, 
United States, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and India were sealed in bags 
and left at different places in the area. The spokesman said 
this is one of the major successes of the BSF in its drive 
against international smugglers operating between India and 
Pakistan via Jammu border.

  [Text] Tunis, 14 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat met again tonight with the Israeli delegation led by 
Jacques Neriya, the Israeli prime minister's adviser, who 
arrived here earlier today. 
  This morning the Israeli delegation met with 'Arafat and 
held 
intensive talks with him. Yuri Savir, director general of the 
Israeli Foreign Ministry, and General 'Uzi Dayan, head of 
planning in the Defense Ministry, took part in the talks as well 
as PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh; Abu-Ala' 
[Ahmad Quray'], head of the PLO's Economic Department; and Akram 
Haniyah, 'Arafat's adviser on the occupied territories affairs. 
  Following this meeting, the Israeli delegation telephoned 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and briefed him on the 
results of the talks with 'Arafat. 
  The Israeli delegation arrived in Tunisia last night aboard 
a 
private Israeli plane but the Tunisian authorities refused to 
let it land. The delegation then returned to Rome where it

  [Text] Dubai, United Arab Emirates, March 12 (AFP) -- 
Jordan is trying to re-enter lucrative Gulf markets after more 
than three years of estrangement caused by its alleged support 
for Iraq against Kuwait, officials said on Friday [11 March]. 
  More than 20 Jordanian companies will display clothes, 
furniture, medicine and other products at an international 
exhibition in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) this 
month, they said. 
  "The participation in this fair and other fairs is aimed at 
restoring Jordanian manufacturers' share of the Gulf market to 
the pre-Gulf crisis level," a spokesman for the participating 
companies said in a statement. 
  "These non-traditional markets require a different set of 
marketing and manufacturing standards and our manufacturers are 
trying to meet them. In terms of quality and service, most 
companies have undergone restructuring while revamping their 
marketing practices to face new challenges." 
  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states were among the biggest 
markets for Jordanian products before they halted dealing over 
its alleged sympathy with Iraq. Amman has denied backing Iraq's 
1990 invasion of Kuwait and has tried to several times to 
restore links but has been rebuffed. 
  The six members -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
Bahrain 
and the UAE-- were also the main financial backers of Jordan 
before the war, providing more than 12 billion dollars in aid 
and billions more in remittances. 
  A suspension of Gulf aid aggravated Jordan's economic 
problems, which include a debt of around eight billion dollars. 
  The Jordan Trade Association, the country's main export 
promoter representing more than 80 firms, is spearheading the 
participation in the March 16-20 fair in Dubai, the organisers, 
al-Fajir company, said.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Mariam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Islamists, and pan-Arab nationalists, long at 
loggerheads, are unifying their ranks following last month's 
attack on the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron and the subsequent 
attack on a Maronite church in Lebanon. 
  "The February events were not the only reason why the front, 
which is a coalition of two parties, was formed but it was the 
final push," said the head of the powerful Islamic Action Front 
(IAF), Dr. Ishaq al-Farhan. 
  Earlier this week the IAF and a relatively new and obscure 
political party, the National Action Front (NAF), announced that 
they were "`coalition partners' resisting Zionist designs and 
new world order strategies to disrupt the Middle Eastern 
region." The NAF comprises mostly hardline pan-Arab 
nationalists many of whom were outlawed in Jordan before 
democratic reforms were introduced. 
  "One of our main aims," said Mr. al-Farhan, "is to make 
clear 
that there is no real contradiction between Islam and the 
essence of Western civilisation. These are superficial 
differences which are being played up by those who think they 
will benefit from a confrontation." 
  "There is an obvious effort to blacken the face of the Arabs 
and the Muslims in the world and our coalition aims at fighting 
this campaign of hatred against Islam and the Arab people," he 
added. 
  The coalition is open "to all those parties and groups which 
wish to join," said an IAF member Thursday. While no clear 
"strategies" to counter the "anti-Islamic and Arab propaganda" 
had been drawn up as of yet, "preparatory meetings were" in the 
making, according to IAF officials. 
  None of the NAF officials could be reached for comment. 
  The coalition joins the mostly secular pan-Arab activists 
and 
the largest Islamic party in Jordan. A source close to the 
groups said that the recent attempts to smudge the "image of 
Arabs in the West" had contributed to the formation of the 
coalition. 
  "The World Trade Center affair, the unfair treatment of the 
accused and the verdict against them was one of the main points 
of concern, but this is one of many anti-Arab smear campaigns 
that we want to counter," said the source. 
  The charge that two Libyans blew up a Pan-Am airliner over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, the continued sanctions against Iraq, the 
"media campaigns" against Arab and Muslim governments in Sudan 
and Somalia, as well as recent moves by the French authorities 
to curb the movement of Arabs living in France were all 
mentioned as international issues that led to the forming of the 
coalition, said the source close to the NAF. The NAF was the 
21st party to receive official licensing in Jordan this January.

  [Text] Dr. Ishaq al-Farhan, secretary general of the 
Islamic Action Front [IAF], has denied any link between the 
Islamic movement and the weapons and explosives that the 
newspapers said were found recently by the security forces in a 
village in al-Karak Governorate. 
  Answering a question by AKHIR KHABAR on the link between the 
weapons and the Muslim Brotherhood, Dr. al-Farhan said: You can 
ask the Muslim Brotherhood about this. 
  But, he added: This is silly, making connections between 
what is taking place and the Islamic movement. Those who fight 
to protect the nation's unity do not seek to divide it from 
within. 
  He said: We have not ruled out the involvement of the Mosad 
[Israeli intelligence service] or the anti-Islamic forces, which 
are trying to shake our national unity and undermine the bridges 
of confidence on which basis we have been serving the homeland 
and nation for decades. 
  He also said: We spoke to officials and explained our open 
position toward these issues. Everyone knows the movement's 
Islamic, nationalist, and pan-Arab positions. 
  Recent press reports on the al-Karak weapons cache cited a 
link between the Islamic Centers Society, one of the most 
important Muslim Brotherhood establishments, and the weapons 
that were discovered.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "We Welcome Russian Initiative, Condemn French </F>
Initiative, But..."] 
  [Text] The Russian initiative to reconvene the Madrid 
conference on peace in the Middle East coincided with a French 
initiative, represented by the French-Israeli military 
cooperation pact, signed by the French defense minister not far 
from the spot still dripping with the blood of the martyrs of 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. 
  Although the Russian initiative appears to be positive and 
to 
be aimed at breaking the stalemate in the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations, this initiative should not make us believe that 
Russia, which attended the first Madrid conference under the 
umbrella of the Soviet Union that was then passing away, can now 
assume a leading role in events under its current circumstances, 
which are no better than those prevailing when it attended the 
first conference in Madrid. 
  As for the French initiative, it is not only very bad 
because 
of its timing, but also because of its contents, which activate 
military relations with Israel--relations that have been nearly 
severed since the aggression in 1967. 
  Contrary to the position expected from Paris, in light of 
its 
exclusion from negotiations and from its previous effective role 
in reaching an agreement--the same as the case with Europe, 
China, and Japan--we see France courting Tel Aviv and concluding 
a military pact for research and development instead of seeking 
to foster relations with the Arab parties to the negotiations, 
which are besieged by Israeli intransigence and U.S. pressure. 
This pact implies encouragement for Israel to continue the 
expansionist, Zionist, and aggressive policy. 
  We view the Russian initiative positively, in spite of the 
possible intentions and circumstances that serve Moscow's 
objectives of seeking more Western assistance and restoring U.S. 
political support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which has 
begun to falter. As much as we are disturbed by the negative 
French initiative, we know that the U.S. Administration is the 
main party responsible for the crisis in the negotiations. It 
is a result of the full and unlimited U.S. support for Israel 
and because the United States prevents the international 
community from carrying out any positive role in implementing 
the resolutions of the international community or forcing Israel 
to heed the UN resolutions on our rights in Palestine and the 
Arab territories occupied after the 1967 aggression. 
  We, as well as the entire international community, know that 
Washington monopolized the role of the sole power able to 
influence international events in general and our negotiations 
with Israel in particular. We also know that any failure or 
slowness in these negotiations and any Zionist threat to world 
security and peace in this region is the full responsibility of 
the United States. In spite of this belief, which many people 
share with us, we welcome the positive Russian initiative, and 
condemn the negative French initiative launched at this delicate 
time.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Double Standards"] </F>
  [Text] While the United States brings pressure to bear on 
the PLO to resume the peace negotiations in the wake of the 
Hebron massacre, it threatens to use its veto to obstruct any 
effective UN Security Council resolution that will protect the 
Palestinian people from the occupation and the terrorism of the 
Israeli Army and settlers. 
  This contradictory stand once again shows the U.S. 
double-standard in its approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
The results of the official investigation clearly point to the 
direct or indirect involvement of the Israeli Army, if not the 
government and its prime minister, in this act of killing and 
terrorism. Thus, the talk about peace and the resumption of the 
peace process in accordance with the previous bases is just an 
attempt to mark time and to cushion the great shock brought 
about by the massacre of the worshipers in the blessed 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque on the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and 
international levels. 
  By procrastinating and obstructing the passage of a UN 
resolution condemning the massacre and adopting a mechanism to 
prevent its recurrence, the United States has exposed its 
desperate attempt to waste time and cover up for the crime and 
its perpetrators. It is an attempt by the United States to 
shirk its responsibility toward what happened. Its shy stands 
on settlements and settlers, and the question of supplying them 
with money and weapons are well known. It is not strange that 
the principal perpetrator of the crime is a U.S. citizen who was 
brought up in Brooklyn and was nurtured on terrorism and racism 
there like many other Jewish terrorists. 
  It goes without saying that the stand adopted by Russia, 
which is the second cosponsor of the peace conference, and the 
efforts it has exerted, irrespective of their motives and 
objectives, deserve praise. The same applies to the European 
stand, which deserves to be emulated by Washington in an effort 
by the international community and international legitimacy to 
restore Palestinian rights and land to their legitimate owners 
and end the injustice, trials, and terrorism from which the 
Palestinian people have been suffering for so long.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Arbitrariness at the Security Council"] </F>
  [Text] The United States is continuing its arbitrary 
policies and showing its disdain for the Arab nation through the 
farce of consultations that the UN Security Council has been 
carrying out for the last two weeks over the massacre of the age 
committed by the Zionist gangs in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in 
Hebron. 
  When we say the Security Council, we in fact mean the U.S. 
Administration that has imposed its full control and hegemony 
over the international organization since the Gulf crisis in 
1990 and the subsequent host of unjust resolutions adopted, in 
record time, against fraternal Iraq. The Iraqi people are still 
suffering from the effects of these unjust and unprecedented 
resolutions even though their alleged justifications are over. 
  Within less than two weeks, the Security Council adopted 
some 
13 resolutions, including a resolution that allowed the 
launching of a brutal aggression against Iraq, in addition to 
the imposition of an all-out siege. On the other hand, the 
council has spent two full weeks on consultations on the most 
brutal and unprecedented massacre in contemporary history. 
These consultations have been subject to strange U.S. 
bargaining. This bargaining has once again shown the hypocrisy, 
double-standards, and blatant contradictions in U.S. political 
behavior. It has exposed the allegations about eagerness to 
implement international legitimacy and UN resolutions. 
  The final straw in this U.S. bargaining was the humiliating 
condition set by Christopher in his telephone contact with 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last Thursday. Christopher 
emphasized his administration's position, which forms a link 
between any proposed international resolution condemning the 
massacre and the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, despite the fact that the U.S. position on the 
draft resolution is not far from what Israeli wants. Washington 
insists on a diluted resolution that does not contain any 
serious measures to deter the Israelis from their repressive 
policy in the occupied Arab territories. 
  We have never had a good opinion of U.S. intentions toward 
our just Arab causes. We have never ignored the nature of the 
strategic alliance between the United States and Israel, which 
has continued for decades, or the unlimited U.S. support for 
Zionist aggressiveness against the Arab nation. We are fully 
aware that restoring respect and dignity to this nation cannot 
be realized through the emotions of the United States, because 
politics and interests do not know emotions. There is no 
alternative for Arab solidarity, even the minimum of this 
solidarity.

  [Text] The president, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, has 
said the Kashmir resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission 
has greatly helped in internationalizing the issue and in 
molding the international opinion in support of the Kashmiris' 
cause. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, he said the 
resolution on violations of human rights in occupied Kashmir was 
moved by Pakistan at an international forum after a long time 
and it helped in highlighting the Kashmir issue. He was sure 
that its results would be positive in future. The president 
said the Kashmir freedom struggle has been going on since long, 
which the people of the occupied state are waging against Indian 
oppression and occupation [sentence as heard]. He said Pakistan 
is extending all the political, moral, and diplomatic support to 
them. 
  In reply to a question, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari 
said 
it will be his effort and endeavor that on all matters which 
pertain to Pakistan's security interests, national interests, 
and other vital interests, including Kashmir, there must be a 
bipartisan approach. He said in the interest of the Kashmiri 
struggle, there should be a consensus on the Kashmir policy. He 
said that he has tried in the past and will do so in future to 
create better coordination between the government and the 
opposition. To a question, he said as the president of 
Pakistan, all political parties are to equal to him.

  [Text] Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan has clarified that 
Pakistan has not withdrawn the resolution on Kashmir tabled at 
the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. In an interview with 
the ASSOCIATED PRESS OF PAKISTAN in Islamabad today, he refuted 
the Indian claim that the resolution has been withdrawn. The 
resolution was presented, but no voting was held on it. 
However, it is still there as a document. Regarding the visit 
of Muslim ambassadors, he said Pakistan had a clear commitment 
from the Indian Government in which a visit by Muslim 
ambassadors to Kashmir was agreed upon as a part of the 
understanding for not proceeding with a vote on the resolution. 
Therefore, the Indian claim is incorrect in every respect. 
Shaharyar Khan said that one of the two main objectives 
envisaged by Pakistan by presenting the resolution at an UN 
agency was to stop the oppression and violence against the 
people of Kashmir and violation of their human rights. The 
other was to draw the world attention to the Kashmir issue for 
the first time in 30 years. 
  The foreign secretary said that it is already clear that 
India is adopting a more transparent method in dealing with the 
Kashmir situation as a result of the international pressure. 
The group of International Committee for Red Cross, Amnesty 
International, and the ambassadors based in Delhi has been 
invited to visit Kashmir, and now the world community will 
strongly react to Indian Government's atrocities and violence 
against the Kashmiri people. Moreover, the world public opinion 
is now focused on India and the foreign office of every country 
considers the treatment of the Kashmiri people as an important 
issue of the international agenda.

  [Text] The minister for information and broadcasting, Mr. 
Khalid Ahmad Kharal, has said Kashmir will be liberated from the 
cruel clutches of the Indian occupation forces during the tenure 
of the present government. Talking to a gathering in Kamalia 
today, the minister said the people's government has 
internationalized the Kashmir issue and tabled the resolution at 
two international forums. If India will not honor its words, 
Pakistan will agitate the issue again at international forums 
with more vigor and force. Commenting on the press statement of 
Indian authorities in which they contradicted their earlier 
statement about the visit of the ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization] ambassadors to the held valley, the minister said 
Pakistan deferred voting on the resolution at Geneva at the 
request and assurance of Iran which should now take up this 
issue with India. 
  Mr. Khalid Ahmad Kharal regretted that the opposition is 
ignoring the national interests by criticizing the government on 
vitally important national issues like Kashmir. He said despite 
the opposition's disinformation cell activities and propaganda, 
the present government would complete its five-year term and 
continue to serve the masses. He said the People's Party 
government will implement a series of development projects to 
improve the socioeconomic status of farmers and bring the 
backward rural areas at par with the developed ones.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Deprivation of U.S. Aid to Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Congress Foreign Affairs Committee has 
decided not to grant assistance to Pakistan until 1995. 
Detailing the American policy, Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant 
secretary of state for South Asian affairs, said that of the 
$330 million in assistance sought by the U.S. Government from 
the Congress for the assistance program in South Asia, $112 
million is earmarked for Bangladesh, $155 million for India, $28 
million for Nepal, and $35 million for Sri Lanka. No fund has 
been allocated to Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
  That the dreadful civil war in Afghanistan is posing a 
problem to providing assistance to that country is 
understandable to a certain extent. But Pakistan is being 
subjected to this biased treatment by the United States for the 
sole reason that it is not prepared to roll back its nuclear 
program. Now the United States is exerting pressure to roll 
back the program rather than halting or freezing it. This 
American tendency has been construed by India as an appreciation 
for the production of its nuclear weapons. After noting that the 
United States exempts India from all such activities and after 
discerning the American designs toward Pakistan, now there 
exists no scope for optimism. The United States also does not 
want a developing Muslim country to attain capability in 
sophisticated nuclear technology, and if this occurs the U.S. 
wants to deprive it by tormenting it through various sanctions. 
The announcement to grant maximum assistance to India despite 
its gross human rights violations and the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons as well as the plan to keep Pakistan out of the 
assistance program until 1995 warrants us to revise our domestic 
and foreign policies and set fresh priorities. The government 
also should clearly understand that the United States will not 
be content with this and will take steps to cripple Pakistan 
economically and to further torment it by joining hands with its 
Western allies. Therefore, in view of this situation, the 
government should think about taking steps to make the entire 
nation demonstrate total harmony and perfect coordination to 
safeguard its interests and protect its independence, 
sovereignty, and resources. This is possible only through total 
solidarity among the people, and in a broader sense, through 
full coordination of thought between the government and the 
opposition to deal with the situation because it is not a matter 
concerning any particular political party or the government, but 
it concerns the entire country and the people.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Successful Move"] </F>
  [Text] Although voting on Pakistan's resolution on human 
rights violations in held Kashmir tabled before the UN Human 
Rights Commission (UNHRC) in Geneva has been deferred during its 
current session, Pakistan has achieved the basic objective 
underlying the move. Bowing to world pressure, India pledged to 
open up the Kashmir valley to diplomats of Islamic countries, so 
vehemently refused in the past, and requested the UNHRC to 
appeal to Pakistan not to press the resolution. In the 
meantime, the Iranian permanent envoy in the UNHRC declared that 
his country would continue to exert pressure on India to 
alleviate the sufferings of the people of held Kashmir and 
improve the human rights situation there. On his appeal, 
supported by 15 other countries including China, Pakistan agreed 
to defer voting on its resolution for one year. 
  Following tabling of the resolution at Geneva by Pakistan 
for 
censuring India for its violations of human rights in Kashmir 
the scenario kept hanging as the days progressed. There were 
two postponements on the vote on Pakistan's resolution and it 
became obvious that many of the 53 members of the UNHRC would 
abstain during the vote. That would not have been desirable. 
By deferring the vote on its resolution Pakistan has thereby 
gained time to persuade the abstaining countries to review their 
decision. The Latin American countries, in particular, had 
indicated that they wanted a little more time to fully grasp the 
various aspects of the Kashmir problem. On the urging of 
friendly countries Pakistan did not press for a vote, but 
nevertheless it has accomplished what it set out to do. By 
tabling the resolution at UNHRC and actively lobbying for it 
Pakistan has fully succeeded in highlighting the Kashmir dispute 
and focusing attention of the international community on the 
miserable human right situation prevailing in Indian occupied 
Kashmir. It is because of the intense diplomatic pressure 
Pakistan put on India that Delhi recently arranged visits by two 
batches of foreign diplomats to Kashmir and announced permission 
for a team of International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to 
visit it. Also notable is the fact that since the beginning of 
the current session of UNHRC at which Pakistan tabled its 
resolution, there has been a drastic reduction in the killings 
in occupied Kashmir. As Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali 
put it, the said resolution is very much alive and can be put up 
at other forums. Thus while on the one hand Pakistan has 
succeeded in putting India on the defensive on the human right 
issue in held Kashmir, on the other, it retains the diplomatic 
initiative in the matter.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Withdrawing the Resolution on Kashmir -- </F>
Repeating the Blunder"] 
  [Text] The Pakistan Government has decided to withdraw the 
resolution against human rights violations by Indian forces in 
occupied Kashmir. The resolution was to be presented at the UN 
Human Rights Commission. Intensive debate on the matter was 
continuing for the last few days and voting was scheduled on 9 
March. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told a news 
conference at the Foreign Ministry on 9 March evening that China 
and Iran had told Pakistan not to press for the adoption of the 
resolution or to withdraw it. Both of them are Pakistan's 
friends and their request cannot be ignored. 
  By withdrawing the resolution from the UN Human Rights 
Commission, the Government of Pakistan repeated the same blunder 
it committed when it withdrew the resolution on the same topic 
from the UN General Assembly in December last year. It had then 
evoked a strong reaction not only inside the country, but also 
among the people of Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir and Kashmiris 
throughout the world. 
  In justifying the withdrawal of the resolution from the UN 
Human Rights Commission, the foreign minister has said that this 
cannot be construed to mean Pakistan's failure. Because 44 of 
the 53 members of the commission had decided to abstain from 
voting, and there would have been no significance if the 
resolution had been adopted by a vote of only eight members 
excluding the commission president. 
  The foreign minister's logic is beyond the comprehension of 
the Pakistani people. The people are justified in asking the 
foreign minister and the prime minister why the Pakistani 
Foreign Ministry could not deduce that 44 members would abstain 
from voting and thus make a resolution adopted in such manner 
meaningless. The Foreign Office was so unaware that it did not 
understand the "importance" of the global perspective of the 
resolution and it failed to anticipate that a large number of 
commission members would not vote on the resolution. If it was 
aware, then why did it keep assuring the people of Pakistan that 
"the Pakistani resolution will be adopted with a heavy majority" 
and that India would be globally condemned, boosting the cause 
of the freedom struggle in Kashmir? 
  The country's important and patriotic circles will also find 
it very hard to agree with the foreign minister's argument that 
the countries which decided to abstain in the voting actually 
gave India an opportunity to improve the situation in occupied 
Kashmir. We would like to remind the foreign minister that when 
Pakistan withdrew the resolution against India from the UN 
General Assembly, it was then said that the friendly countries 
which pressured for the resolution's withdrawal felt that India 
would hold talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute. But the 
fate of that talk is well- known to the people of Pakistan as 
well as the leaders of the present government. It is on record 
that the Foreign Office and the rulers have both been regretting 
it after they realized that India had requested for talks only 
to buy time. The question is, will India really improve the 
situation in occupied Kashmir now that the resolution has been 
withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Commission. Will India agree 
to allow world agencies to freely visit occupied Kashmir, to 
assess the situation there, and to withdraw its forces from 
occupied Kashmir? These are the questions even a naive person 
would answer in the negative. But why did the veteran officials 
of our Foreign Office fail to understand them? 
  The foreign minister has claimed that the practical aspect 
of 
the resolution was to force India to allow international 
missions to visit occupied Kashmir. But, India has already 
allowed a delegation of ambassadors into occupied Kashmir. 
Perhaps the foreign minister did not notice the news about the 
delegation carried by the international media during the last 
two days. Pakistani newspapers and radio and television reports 
have also noted that the delegation was not allowed to move 
freely. On the contrary, the people who tried to meet the 
delegation were baton-charged and fired upon. 
  KHABRAIN has reported the other day that Pakistan's decision 
to amend the resolution made it [word indistinct]. Through an 
amendment to the resolution on 8 March, Pakistan has omitted the 
provision that a UN Human Rights Commission mission be sent to 
occupied Kashmir to investigate the human rights situation and 
submit a report to the commission. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, 
chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, also 
criticized the amendment saying that "the amendment in the 
resolution has vindicated my apprehensions." He had also 
convened a meeting of the Kashmir Committee on 20 March to 
discuss the matter. It remains to be seen how the committee 
reacts at the meeting to the Pakistani decision to withdraw the 
resolution itself. 
  The present government has prompted harsh criticism and 
confrontation by withdrawing the resolution. We fear the 
opposition will react strongly to the Pakistani Government's 
decision. The decision will also affect the Kashmir struggle 
negatively and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of 
frustration. The people and Kashmiri circles will not accept 
the justification presented by the government for its decision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dilemma of Military Expenditure"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said Pakistan 
will not reduce its defence budget given the security 
environment in the region. In specific terms, it means no 
slashing of the traditional arms and size of the armed forces 
themselves. She told the cabinet's defence committee Thursday 
that the government could not afford to disregard new threats to 
the security of the country. She was clearly referring to the 
recent 15 percent increase in the Indian defence budget. The 
army chief also gave the defence committee details of likely 
purchase of new arms from China and other friendly countries. 
It is true that no self-respecting nation can afford to place 
its security interests in jeopardy, even if it is faced with the 
most forbidding economic constraints. Unfortunately, the 
militarisation of the sub-continent is a phenomenon that does 
not mesh with new realities across the globe. Both India and 
Pakistan seem to match each other's new acquisition of arms or 
other military capabilities. This has naturally sent their 
economies into a tailspin. India owes upwards of $98 billion to 
foreign creditors; Pakistan, considering the size of its 
economy, has also amassed a near-impossible figure of $30 
billion in foreign debts. There is no knowing exactly how much 
money is funnelled into defence, but conservative estimates put 
it, in case of Pakistan, at close to $3 billion; in case of 
India it could be three times more. These are colossal sums by 
the third world standards; sums that could have been used for 
building vital infrastructure, especially that of health and 
education. The cost of a tank could be used to establish scores 
of schools in the countryside. Indeed, both nations are dying 
without having to fight a war. 
  There are few examples of unilateral disarmament in human 
history; and weaker nations have invariably invited aggression. 
Unless both India and Pakistan agree to a mutual reduction of 
arms, peace and prosperity for both will remain an elusive 
dream. The present high level of military preparedness is bound 
to push them over the precipice. When we have too many people 
chasing war against too few working for peace, the road to 
normalisation must lie through impossible terrain. The 
international community is now reacting, albeit slowly, to the 
violation of human rights in Kashmir. Foreign mediation is the 
only safe bet that can disengage such implacable foes as India 
and Pakistan. The question is, how long can Pakistan and India 
go on ignoring the cost to their societies of such immense 
military expenditure.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Winding Up the Narcotics Control Board"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has issued orders to 
dismantle the Pakistan Narcotics Control Board [PNCB] with 
immediate effect and to make it a part of the National Narcotics 
Control Agency in the wake of the board's failure to check 
narcotics smuggling. The chairman of the PNCB has been removed 
from his current post and appointed as an officer on special 
duty, while Major Salahuddin Ghazi, the director general of the 
Antinarcotics Task Force, has been temporarily appointed as 
chairman of the PNCB [sentence as published]. 
  In view of the large funds provided to the PNCB and wide 
powers given to it, one would have rightly expected that the 
board would play a very important role in checking smuggling and 
growth of narcotics menace. The PNCB has not only miserably 
failed in achieving the targets and objectives, but some of its 
officials have also been found to be involved in narcotics 
trade. Several domestic and foreign agencies have vehemently 
criticized its performance. Under these circumstances, even the 
general public was questioning the justification for the 
continued existence of the PNCB in view of its miserable 
performance despite such a formidable amount of money invested 
in it. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has taken an important 
step by disbanding the PNCB, which was an inevitable step in the 
interest of the nation and the country. However, the new task 
force set up to control narcotics smuggling needs to be made so 
effective that its solid performance in eliminating the drug 
smuggling should by itself become visible to the public. A 
close watch should also be kept on the officials of the task 
force, so that they remain free of all the shortcomings, 
weaknesses, and corruptions that led to the dissolution of the 
Pakistan Narcotics Control Board.

  [Text] Tunis, 14 Mar (MENA)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator on the Middle East peace process, 
held a closed meeting this evening. After the meeting, which 
lasted about 75 minutes, Ross said they discussed the PLO's 
commitment to resuming the peace negotiations and its commitment 
to the Declaration of Principles. He said they also discussed a 
number of topics, including Palestinian concerns about the 
situation in the occupied territories and commitments related to 
the peace process. Ross said that the most important thing is to 
finish these negotiations and start implementing the Declaration 
of Principles. What concerns us, he said, is to see a change in 
the situation on the ground, new realities in the region, and 
the implementation of the Declaration of Principles. 
  Before meeting with 'Arafat, Ross met with the Israeli 
delegation led by Jacques Neriya, the Israeli prime minister's 
adviser, who arrived in Tunis today.

  [Text] Brother President Abu 'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] 
yesterday sent a written message to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin in reply to his important political message conveyed by 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to brother President Abu 
'Ammar the day before yesterday in Tunis. 
  In his message brother President Abu 'Ammar expressed his 
great satisfaction at the high level of cordiality and sincerity 
in the current dialogue between the PLO and friendly Russia, 
which confirms the standing and development of the relations of 
friendship, cooperation, and consultation between the 
Palestinian and Russian peoples. 
  Brother President Abu 'Ammar valued President Yeltsin's 
eagerness for the peace process and negotiations to continue, 
the important steps taken by President Yeltsin and the Russian 
Government to prevent the escalation of violence in the occupied 
Palestinian territories, and also Russian efforts in the UN 
Security Council in getting issued an effective resolution that 
would fulfill the Palestinians' just demands. 
  In his message brother Abu 'Ammar also expressed his 
confidence that friendly Russia, as a co-sponsor of the peace 
conference, would continue to make efforts to ensure the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles agreement.

  [Text] Yesterday morning brother President Abu 'Ammar 
[Yasir 'Arafat] visited the martyrs' cemetery in Tunis 
accompanied by members of the Palestinian leadership and 
revolutionary cadres. 
  After the brother president and those attending had recited 
Surah al-Fatihah [opening verses of the Koran] for the souls of 
the innocent martyrs, brother President Abu 'Ammar gave an 
address in which he stressed that the waterfall of Palestinian 
blood would not halt for one moment until the Palestinian flag 
and the flag of the Arab nation were raised over the walls, 
minarets, and churches of Jerusalem. 
  Brother President Abu 'Ammar made a pledge to all the 
martyrs 
that the revolution, on whose long and difficult road they had 
fallen, would continue, however great and long the sacrifices 
and however much the difficulties increased, through the 
determination and will of our people until victory and as far as 
Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Fatah leader in the </F>
occupied territories and Palestinian negotiator, by Sa'id 
Mu'addi; place and date not given; from the "With the Events" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: The Kakh and 
Kahana Hay movements have been outlawed. How does the 
Palestinian side view the [Israeli] Government's decision in 
this regard? 
  [Al-Husayni] First, I believe this decision came too late. 
It was unnecessary to commit the [Hebron] massacre in order to 
make such a decision. In any case, to make such a decision--no 
matter how late--is better than not to make any decision. 
However, what is more important than making this decision is 
implementing it, and figuring out how to do it. Will this 
actually be a battle against all these settlers who are opposed 
to the peace process and the idea of peace, or will its 
implementation be confined to those whose membership in Kakh is 
confirmed? 
  [Mu'addi] What can be done immediately to ease the tension 
prevailing in the Palestinian streets in the wake of this 
incident? 
  [Al-Husayni] First, I believe that the settlers residing in 
Hebron should be evacuated. In addition, arrangements should be 
made to protect the Palestinian people's security. Such 
arrangements should include the issue of arming the settlers 
everywhere. We believe that these settlers should be disarmed, 
and that the army, and not the settlers, should maintain 
security, especially since many of these settlers engaged in 
settlement activities from the very beginning in order to 
achieve a single objective; namely, to foil this political 
process. 
  We also believe that the file of settlements should be 
opened 
at the negotiating table because this directly concerns the 
Palestinian people's security. This issue should thus be 
discussed. Discussions should not be confined to the Israeli 
people's security, as was the case in the past. 
  [Mu'addi] Do you believe that Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations may resume next week in light of the intensive 
consultations and contacts in Tunis, Washington, and Jerusalem? 
  [Al-Husayni] In fact, it depends on the practices on the 
ground in terms of evacuating the settlers and releasing the 
Palestinian detainees. All these issues, together, can pave the 
way for the resumption of negotiations. I believe it is almost 
impossible to resume negotiations without making any kind of 
implementation on the ground. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Faysal al-Husayni: Thank you very much, and 
many happy returns ['Id greetings]. 
  [Al-Husayni] Same to you.

  [Text] In a meeting yesterday with French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard, Faysal al-Husayni and other Palestinian 
figures in the territories conveyed their annoyance over the 
security agreements signed between France and Israel. 
  The Palestinians said this is not the right time to sign 
cooperation agreements with Israel on security and military 
issues. According to them, such agreements, coming in the 
aftermath of the Hebron massacre, encourage Israel to perpetuate 
its policy vis-a-vis the Palestinians. 
  In a news conference with French journalists, Leotard said 
such an issue did not come up in his meeting with the 
Palestinians. 
  Referring to French assistance, the Palestinians stressed 
the 
need for political over any other kind of aid. They asked 
France to try to bring about a change in the Israeli position 
with regard to the settlers and the settlements so that a small 
number of settlements may be removed already at this stage. 
  Replying to the Palestinians' request that France support 
the 
notion of international protection in the territories, Leotard 
said that if Israel and the Palestinians reached an agreement to 
this effect, France would agree to participate in such a force. 
  At the news conference, Leotard said that France would agree 
to an international presence but not to an international force. 
  The French minister expressed willingness to help train 
personnel for the Palestinian police force.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO "Foreign Minister" Faruq Qaddumi by </F>
Brigitte Voykowitsch in Tunis; date not given: "First a UN 
Resolution, Then Negotiations"] 
  [Text] "The conference would have to precisely analyze the 
reasons that the process has stalled and set down how things are 
going to proceed," Qaddumi says. "We are just waiting for the 
Russians to specify their proposal [on a second Middle East 
conference in Madrid]. 
  [Voykowitsch] Did Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
give any more specific information about that during his meeting 
with Yasir 'Arafat on Friday evening [11 March]. 
  [Qaddumi] No. He wanted to make the Palestinians agree to a 
resumption of the negotiations with Israel. Our answer was: 
First, the two co-sponsors of the peace process must make sure 
that a UN resolution is adopted and that the Palestinians are 
granted protection. The United States and Russia must come to 
an agreement on the guarantees they want to give to the 
Palestinians that events like the massacre of Hebron will not 
happen again. First, protective measures must be implemented. 
Then we can resume negotiations. 
  [Voykowitsch] You have been extremely critical of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement right from the beginning. What is the 
document still worth today? 
  [Qaddumi] I have always been skeptical whether the Israelis 
consider their signature worth anything. I expected they would 
keep finding new justifications to delay the implementation of 
the agreement. We cannot continue with this farce. The 
Israelis have to withdraw quickly from Gaza and Jericho -- and 
Jericho covers 345 square kilometers. If this does not happen, 
the agreement is just a piece of paper that does not commit 
anybody to anything. 
  [Voykowitsch] How strong are the voices in the occupied 
territories, which demand a resumption of the armed struggle? 
  [Qaddumi] We have never given up our resistance, and it will 
continue as long as Israeli soldiers are on our territory. The 
intifadah is a democratic resistance and it has been supported 
by the large majority of the international community. It is a 
legal means of self-defense. 
  [Voykowitsch] How much terrain has the PLO lost to Hamas? 
  [Qaddumi] The problem is not one between the PLO and Hamas. 
We both pursue the same struggle -- we are defending ourselves. 
But we have different tactics. Our problem consists of the 
Israelis. They have undermined the peace process. James Baker, 
architect of the process, said that we must build trust. But 
the governments of Shamir and Rabin have only sown new distrust. 
The Israelis have deprived us of our credibility. Only 20 
percent of the Palestinians still support the peace process. 
The PLO feels committed to the process, but it can continue 
only if the protection of the Palestinians is guaranteed. The 
massacre of Hebron has shown again that Zionism is some kind of 
racism. It was a mistake by the United States to rescind this 
resolution. 
  Israel's security is still the absolute priority of U.S. 
foreign policy. Israel gets military support from them and 
increasingly better weapons. The United States, but also 
Britain and France, which has just signed an agreement on 
military cooperation with Israel, must give up their double 
standards.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian </F>
negotiating delegation, in Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in 
Cairo; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Jundi] The Israeli Government has adopted 
measures in an attempt to siphon off Palestinian, Arab, and 
international anger following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
[passage omitted] The question is: Are these measures 
considered political? 
  ['Urayqat] First, the Israeli measures have not risen to the 
required levels. [passage omitted] The issue is extremely 
sensitive. There must be international protection for the 
Palestinian people. Israel cannot be entrusted with the 
security of the Palestinians, especially as the Israeli army 
killed more people after the massacre than fell in the terrorist 
operation in Hebron. Second, with regard to the decision to 
outlaw the Kakh and Kahana Hay Organizations, the Israeli 
Government adopted a decision in 1988 banning political activity 
by Kakh and preventing it from taking part in political 
elections. What's new? Before leaving for the United States, 
did Rabin want to send a message to the U.S. public to say that 
something was done? This is the peak of Israeli indifference, 
particularly, as I have said, as the Kakh Organization has been 
banned from exercising any political activity from the start. 
  [Al-Jundi] Since you referred to Rabin's visit to the United 
States, permit me to ask you: Did Rabin intend, by these recent 
measures, to address a message to the United States and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to avoid pressure by the U.S. 
Administration? 
  ['Urayqat] This is possible. But we must remember that the 
United States has been trying from the first day of the massacre 
to extricate Israel from its predicament. For example, the 
first decision made by Washington was procedural, that is, to 
transfer the negotiations from Cairo to Washington. The 
decision disregarded the substance. The negotiations in Cairo 
took place under Egyptian Government auspices on the highest 
level. There was very strong, positive Egyptian intervention in 
these negotiations. The United States has not intervened since 
the Madrid conference in any of the negotiating tracks. The 
second attempt to limit the damage has been the enormous 
pressure we have been facing as the Palestinian people and 
leadership at the UN Security Council. Everyone knows this and 
it is tantamount to extortion. With these measures, which have 
not risen to the required level of seriousness, Rabin wanted to 
ameliorate world public opinion and convince it that he is 
adopting measures. [passage omitted] 
  As we see on our streets and in our neighborhoods, the 
settlers move around with their weapons and provoke the people. 
Curfews are imposed on the victims. What we want to say is 
that the Israeli Government measures are ridiculous. They are 
surprising. They cast suspicion on Israel's credibility and 
desire for peace. We have told Israel from the beginning that 
the settlements are a time bomb. Israel said it will guarantee 
that no settler will carry out operations against the 
Palestinian people. After the terrorist operation in Hebron, 
who will guarantee that no new crime will take place in a 
mosque, church, field, university, or hospital? We must 
consider these issues, because we don't want to turn the 
occupied Palestinian territories into a new Bosnia in 10 years. 
  [Al-Jundi] Can we say that the Palestinian negotiating 
strategy will take a new course, especially with regard to the 
removal of the settlements, because they constitute hotbeds of 
tension and time bombs in the occupied territory? 
  ['Urayqat] The negotiations are not an end in and of 
themselves. Nor is their resumption. The issue is the 
substance of the negotiations. After the massacre, we are 
saying that any negotiations that do not have the settlements 
issue on their agenda will be useless and will complicate 
things. [passage omitted] 
  We are saying that the negotiations cannot proceed as they 
did before the massacre. What we fear is that Rabin wants to 
reorganize the occupation. The peace process was based on the 
principle of land for peace and on Resolution 242, which 
stipulated in its preamble that the occupation of others' 
territories by force is impermissible. The time has come, not 
only for a Palestinian, but also for an Arab stance, that is, a 
stance by Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the PLO, one that 
is directly concerned with the peace process. There is a need 
to convene a summit meeting and I call on the Egyptian 
Government to sponsor such an initiative and convene a meeting 
in Cairo to discuss the overall peace process in light of recent 
developments. It is unreasonable for this massacre to pass as 
if nothing had happened and for life to return to normal as a 
result of U.S. pressure and Israeli intransigence. 
  [Al-Jundi] Arab brothers, we thank our guest Dr. Sa'ib 
'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli 
peace negotiations. Dr. 'Urayqat, thank you very much and happy 
holiday. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you. A happy holiday to all.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO UN envoy Nasir al-Qudwah, in </F>
New York, by Salah Salamah, in the studio, date not given; from 
"The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salamah] Thank you for being with us on "The 
Event" program. 
  [Al-Qudwah] Thank you. 
  [Salamah] You have been following daily developments in New 
York in your official capacity. How do you explain the 
footdragging in passing a resolution? 
  [Al-Qudwah] The reasons are numerous. One of these is that 
there are real differences between the Americans and ourselves 
on the wording with respect to Jerusalem as an integral part of 
the occupied territories, the protection of the Palestinian 
people, and the role of the sponsors of the peace process on the 
ground. Also, the United States wants to advance certain 
objectives in return for going along with a UN Security Council 
resolution. In any case, we believe we have not compromised any 
of the components of our position. 
  [Salamah] What seems to be the sticking point? Is it the 
text of the resolution, or is it the international presence or 
guarantees? 
  [Al-Qudwah] Personally, I think the text of the resolution 
has been settled, and that the United States may seek some way 
to get around its opposition to certain parts, specifically the 
one to do with Jerusalem. The United States may seek a separate 
vote on each item of the resolution. What remains to be sorted 
out is the wording of the part dealing with a general Middle 
East settlement. 
  [Salamah] According to one report, there has been a 
suggestion that passage of the resolution will be linked to a 
resumption of the talks. How do you react to this report? 
  [Al-Qudwah] We are against such linkage. At the same time, 
we have made it plain that we are not boycotting the peace 
process. Neither are any of the parties involved in the peace 
process. Our position is clear. Our return to the negotiating 
process and its success clearly hinge on creating new facts in 
the occupied territory, whereby the Palestinian people are 
afforded protection through a direct international presence and 
a package of measures that must be instituted by the Israeli 
Government. This includes disarming settlers, dismantling, at 
any rate, some of these settlements, and expediting negotiations 
over their final status within the framework of the agreement 
concluded with Israel. We want this resolution to create new 
facts that may facilitate a return to the negotiating table. 
  [Salamah] You have spoken of the implementation of the 
resolution which you are expecting from the UN Security Council. 
What guarantees are you demanding to implement this resolution 
after your past experience with the previous resolutions, which 
remained mere ink on paper? 
  [Al-Qudwah] Exactly. In fact, I have said the same thing 
many ties over the past few days. We said clearly that the main 
thing in this respect is not necessarily adopting the 
resolution. The main thing is implementing this resolution. No 
doubt, adopting the resolution will be an important step 
forward, but this is not enough. We want to move to the 
implementation immediately after the adoption. We have bitter 
experience in terms of adopting resolutions that are not 
applied. Therefore, we must transfer the weight of the 
political moves toward the implementation process directly after 
the adoption of the resolution. 
  [Salamah] Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah, my colleague Joseph Samahah 
would like to ask you a question. 
  [Samahah] Hello, Mr. Nasir. 
  [Al-Qudwah] You are welcome. 
  [Samahah] The question is if the resolution is agreed on 
without the issue of Jerusalem. [sentence as heard] Has there 
been agreement on the nature of the international presence, its 
type, tasks, and points of reference, the areas of deployment, 
and if this means intervention by the UN Security Council or 
merely an implementation of the PLO-Israel bilateral agreement, 
because this was also a bone of contention. How was it thrashed 
out? 
  [Al-Qudwah] Brother Joseph, no doubt simply dealing with a 
general issue related to the Middle East and the Palestinian 
question is in itself an achievement and a change from the 
previous situation. We must remember that the UN Security 
Council has not discussed this question since the beginning of 
the Madrid process, except on two occasions. The issue in both 
cases was only the issue of deportation. At other times, the 
council was practically prevented from tackling this issue. 
  Therefore, in principle there is an important change. As for 
the contents of the resolution, as I have said, the United 
States has a problem with regard to Jerusalem. We vehemently 
insisted that no change should be introduced in this regard. 
For them, the solution could be, as I said, demanding separate 
voting on paragraphs and abstaining from voting on this 
particular paragraph. This procedural solution will not change 
the final result, which is adopting the resolution by consensus 
[al-tawafuq] as is agreed so far, including, of course, the 
paragraphs that deal with our definite demands, particularly 
providing protection for the Palestinian people. 
  [Samahah] But you have not answered my question on the 
international presence, its type, tasks, and points of 
reference, the areas of deployment. Is it in Gaza and Jericho, 
or in the entire West Bank and Gaza? Is it in accordance with 
the Declaration of Principles, or will it transcend it, being a 
Security Council resolution, or is it in implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement? The question is still there. 
  [Salamah] Has this issue been thrashed out or not? 
  [Al-Qudwah] This is clear from the wordage. The text reads 
that the UN Security Council demands measures to provide 
protection for the Palestinian people in all the occupied 
territory. These are the words. 
  [Salamah] And it will be adopted in this form? 
  [Al-Qudwah] Yes. 
  [Salamah] And there is U.S. approval? 
  [Al-Qudwah] In English, it says: "throughout the occupied 
territory" [preceding four words in English]. The singular form 
is used, which means territorial unity of these areas. 
  [Salamah] Last question: How do you evaluate the other 
states' attitude toward the draft resolution? 
  [Al-Qudwah] The vast majority of the other states were 
extremely responsive. This horrible massacre undoubtedly 
engendered general international sympathy toward the Palestinian 
cause and the just demands we presented to the council. There 
were really no problems with any state among the UN Security 
Council member states. Our negotiations were, in fact, with the 
U.S. delegation in the presence -- but not with the effective 
participation -- of the Russian Federation delegation. 
  [Salamah] Thank you, Mr. Nasir al-Qudwah. 
  [Al-Qudwah] Thank you, my dear brother.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Exposed U.S. Position"] </F>
  [Text] Once again the Security Council deliberations over 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and the procrastination in 
approving clear resolutions on this issue demonstrate the extent 
of the U.S. Administration's full bias in favor of Israel's 
leaders as well as its adoption of and total agreement with 
their positions. 
  Perhaps what exposes this bias is the U.S. stance on 
Jerusalem and the refusal to vote on a resolution that considers 
Jerusalem to be part of the occupied Palestinian territories. 
This, under the pretext of not interfering with what has been 
agreed on in Oslo, namely that discussion on the Jerusalem issue 
will be put off until the final stage of the talks. 
  With this unsound stance, the U.S. Administration is backing 
down from its previous position on Jerusalem, which considered 
the city to be an inseparable part of the occupied territories. 
At the same time, the U.S. Administration is ignoring the fact 
that talks over implementing the Oslo accord should be carried 
out with the aim of applying Security Council Resolution 242, 
which stipulates the inadmissibility of occupying the lands of 
others by force. Clearly, this resolution applies to Jerusalem 
as well. 
  Furthermore, the U.S. Administration's excuse about not 
interfering with what has been agreed on in Oslo is a very 
flimsy pretext, because all the evidence and facts indicate that 
the United States is constantly interfering in the details of 
what is happening in our region -- and always to the advantage 
of Israel's leaders. 
  There is no better proof of this than the U.S. 
Administration's position on Jerusalem and the recent Security 
Council discussions, as well as its invitation to resume the 
talks in Washington in a bid to deflect the massacre's 
repercussions and neutralize any position opposed to keeping the 
settlements in our occupied territories.

  [Text] Islamic militants have issued a veiled warning 
today that revenge for the Hebron massacre might come in 
Brooklyn, New York. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] said in 
a leaflet distributed in the Gaza Strip that the gunman who 
attacked a van of orthodox Jews in New York last week was 
inspired by Islamic teachings. One person was killed and three 
others wounded in that attack by a 28-year old Lebanese-born 
taxi driver.

  [Text] Terrorists fired at an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
patrol in the Tuffah neighborhood in Gaza. The soldiers 
returned fire, wounding 'Adil Abu-al-'Abduh. Our correspondent 
Shlomi Eldar reports that Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
has claimed responsibility for the gunfire at an IDF observation 
post near the Ganey Tal settlement yesterday which slightly 
wounded a soldier. 
  Yesterday Hamas organized a large-scale mourning rally in 
commemoration of Ibrahim Salama, a Hamas fugitive shot dead by 
soldiers at the Eretz checkpoint last week. About 8,000 people 
participated in the rally. Ibrahim Salama had been involved in 
a series of violent attacks in which soldiers were killed. 
Addressing the rally were Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders, as 
well as a Fatah representative. Fugitives affiliated with the 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad fired in the air and pledged 
revenge. Yesterday the Islamic Jihad marked Jerusalem Day, 
which is celebrated on the instructions of Iranian leader 
Ayatollah Khomeyni. Israeli and U.S. flags were burned at the 
rally. 
  A Border Police unit captured three Palestinians armed with 
Kalashnikov rifles in Gaza's al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood tonight. 
Our correspondent Shlomi Eldar reports that the troops 
identified the men in a moving car and detained them without 
encountering resistance. One of the detained Palestinians, 
'Imad Muhammad Mashrawi, is a Fatah Hawks fugitive.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Will Israel be ready to accede in any 
manner whatsoever to one or several of the demands raised 
yesterday by Yasir 'Arafat in order to persuade him to return to 
the negotiations table? 
  [Peres] Look, I think the best way to conduct negotiations 
is not by constantly acceding to demands but rather by sitting 
down together to examine ideas. The problem is not whether to 
accept the PLO demands. The problem is the degree to which the 
PLO's proposals are effective. For example, even had an 
multinational force been stationed in Hebron, it is doubtful 
that it would have been capable of preventing the catastrophe 
that took place. Therefore, one has to search for ways to 
prevent the recurrence of such events. 
  [Zissowitz] Such as the outlawing of the Kakh and Kahana Hay 
movements, for example? 
  [Peres] That definitely constitutes one measure, but it is 
not the only one. We are taking the entire issue very 
seriously, without any connection to the PLO's demands. 
  [Zissowitz] Sir, keeping that in mind, are you disappointed 
that the PLO has failed to respond to Israel's recent steps, 
even after these movements have been banned and their most 
radical activists disarmed and interrogated by the police? 
  [Peres] Look, the word disappointment does not appear in my 
dictionary. I will be very sorry if the Palestinians continue 
to put off the resumption of the negotiations, considering that 
they are pressuring us to meet the timetable, especially with 
regard to wrapping up the negotiations; however, as the Greek 
saying goes: No one can tell you how long it takes to walk to 
town if they do not know when you started or how fast you are 
walking. 
  [Zissowitz] I understand that the steps recently taken by 
the government, such as outlawing these movements and 
interrogating their leaders, were designed to placate Yasir 
'Arafat and.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] No. These steps were taken to 
preclude the recurrence of such catastrophes. We are not 
engaged in placating anyone. We are dealing with 
practicalities. We would have taken these steps even if we were 
not negotiating with 'Arafat. This makes no real difference. 
These are practical issues, and in this case, I believe it is 
in the interests of everyone, both Jews and Arabs, that people 
do not shoot worshipers in the back, be they Jewish or Muslim. 
  [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, do the disappointing results of 
yesterday's meetings in Tunis mean that the talks will stop or 
will the dialogue continue on other tracks? 
  [Peres] I do not think that the dialogue has been broken 
off. Look, people are a bit confused about the negotiations. 
Let me explain what is being discussed with regard to each 
party. With the United States, the PLO is mainly negotiating 
about the impending Security Council resolution. The United 
States has a problem. It has promised not to change the status 
quo with regard to Jerusalem. Moreover, the autonomy agreement 
stipulates that Jerusalem remains outside of its framework. On 
the other hand, the United States does not want to torpedo the 
Security Council's resolutions. The Americans say they are 
prepared to either support the proposed resolution or abstain on 
condition that the PLO returns to the talks. In other words, 
the negotiations between the PLO and the United States center 
around the Security Council. Personally speaking, I believe 
that the PLO is giving too much importance to the Security 
Council resolutions. We have seen that Security Council 
resolutions have not changed the situation in Bosnia or Angola, 
Somalia, or here. That is one thing. 
  Now, the PLO and Israel are discussing three separate 
issues. 
First is the conclusion of the negotiations on the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho. We have concluded most of them, and we still need 
a little bit of time to wrap up the remaining details. 
  [Zissowitz] Will we meet the schedule? 
  [Peres] Look, it depends when we start. Two weeks have 
already been wasted. That is what I am saying. 
  [Zissowitz] Is there still a possibility of completing the 
IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] redeployment by mid-April? 
  [Peres] That possibility is gradually slipping away because 
Pesach is almost here. Let us assume that we start negotiating 
next week. We would only have a very short week, because the 
Pesach holiday starts in the middle. There are also Muslim 
holidays. So if we do not start work very soon, more time will 
be wasted. Israel is telling the Palestinians that the best and 
most impressive thing that can happen between our two peoples is 
to transform the mountains of agreements and declarations into a 
new reality. Constantly making additional declarations will not 
help. I am convinced that the moment the Palestinians start 
managing their own affairs, everyone will see a real change in 
the situation with regard to both Arabs and Jews. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you feel that Yasir 'Arafat is trying to 
exploit the aftermath of the Hebron massacre in order to try to 
extort concessions from Israel that we had rejected earlier in 
Oslo? 
  [Peres] I do not like such expressions, which are more 
suitable for newspaper headlines. I must use more moderate 
language. In order to complete the picture, I would merely like 
to add that there is a third issue: What should be done in the 
wake of the Hebron massacre? We are not denying that the Hebron 
massacre brought home the conclusion on the need to take steps. 
These measures, however, must be logical, effective, and within 
the framework of our capabilities -- and I am also talking about 
legal constraints, as we cannot just take arbitrary steps. 
Therefore, we are asking the Palestinians to sit down together 
with us in order to discuss the agreement on the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho, as well as the aftermath of the Hebron massacre. Let 
us have an open exchange of views. One cannot negotiate by fax 
or in separate meetings. 
  [Zissowitz] Mr. Foreign Minister, with your permission, I 
would like to ask you one more small question. After the 
massacre, Furayh Abu-Middayn, one of the senior PLO officials in 
the Gaza Strip, was quoted by TIME magazine as saying that if 
the Palestinian police had been operating at the time of the 
massacre, the Palestinians would have entered the settlements 
and killed at least 100 people. We will not sit quietly, he 
said. 
  [Peres] That is a thuggish statement of which there is no 
shortage in the Middle East. 
  [Zissowitz] But he is considered one of the most moderate of 
the PLO leaders. 
  [Peres] I am not talking about the man but about the 
statement he made. That kind of language is intolerable, and if 
anyone tries to carry out such actions, he will encounter all 
the necessary resistance. I suggest that we quote people a bit 
less. The history of the Middle East is so full of words and so 
void of actions. Everyone is constantly quoting somebody else. 
A lot of people in our region tend to go off at the mouth, but 
they are not the ones who decide things. We need less talk and 
declarations and more actions to change the reality on the 
ground. 
  [Zissowitz] Thank you, Foreign Minister Peres. 
  [In a report on an interview on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in 
English at 0500 GMT on 15 March, correspondent David Ze'ev 
reports that Foreign Minister Peres said "he believes Prime 
Minister Rabin's meeting with President Clinton in Washington 
will be a push in the right direction with the peace talks" and 
that "while no agreement was reached in consultations between 
Israeli officials and PLO leaders in Tunis, the fact that they

  [Excerpt] Officials in Jerusalem asserted that they knew 
nothing about a specific date for the resumption of the talks 
with the PLO. This was what officials at the Prime Minister's 
Office and the Foreign Ministry told our political correspondent 
Shlomo Raz. 
  This follows reports from Palestinian sources that the talks 
would apparently resume next Monday, 21 March, in Washington.

  [Text] Four members of the PLO leadership in the Gaza 
Strip met with Labor faction members at the Knesset in Jerusalem 
this morning and demanded that settlements in Gaza be 
dismantled. Sufyan Abu-Zayda, one of the delegation members and 
Fatah spokesman in the Gaza Strip, said that the delegation's 
main message was that the settlements constitute an obstacle to 
peace. Another delegation member, Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, said 
that the leadership in Gaza believes in the peace process and is 
committed to it. 'Abd-al-Raziq was jailed for 21 years for 
having participated in setting a booby- trapped car in Rishon 
Leziyyon. He said that he and his friends have now changed 
their positions in the wake of the peace process. 
  The delegation members complained that after the Hebron 
massacre, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] units entered narrow 
alleys in Gaza and engaged in unnecessary confrontations instead 
of restraining themselves in the face of the local residents' 
expressions of grief. According to the four PLO leaders, some of 
the clashes were with children, some of whom were fired upon 
from a distance of 200 meters. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0930 GMT on 15 March adds 
that Abu-Zayda "said that the delegation's meeting with the 
Labor members was approved by 'Arafat and that he will brief 
'Arafat about it."] 
  Eight Labor faction members participated in the meeting. 
Knesset Member [MK] Yosi Katz insisted that the Palestinians 
should not take advantage of the Hebron massacre to add demands 
to the Declaration of Principles. MK Ya'el Dayan agreed that 
settlements in densely populated areas of Gaza should be 
evacuated. MK Dalya Itzik said she regrets the fact that there 
is no peace camp in the Palestinian street similar to Peace Now 
in Israel. 
  Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Knesset 
speaker refused a request from the right-wing factions to 
prevent the PLO delegation members from entering the Knesset. 
National Religious Party MK Yitzhaq Levi complained to the 
House Committee about the fact that this delegation was allowed 
into the Knesset while the wives of the jailed Kakh members were 
barred from doing so yesterday. This afternoon, the Knesset 
House Committee will discuss complaints in this regard raised by 
MK Levi and other right-wing MK's.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Knesset Member 
Arye Der'i a short time ago initialed a coalition agreement 
between Labor and SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim]. During the 
signing ceremony, Der'i hoped that the government would expand 
further. Our party affairs correspondent Sefi Handler reports 
from the Knesset: 
  The Labor-SHAS coalition agreement was initialed about 15 
minutes ago. Why was a full agreement not signed? Because SHAS 
is waiting for Knesset approval of the Meat Law, which could 
take all night. Prime Minister Rabin is due to leave for the 
United States at 0100 [2300 GMT] and he wanted to prevent the 
opposition from filibustering the bill. It was therefore 
decided to initial the agreement first, and wait for Rabin's 
return home for the full signing, since by then the institutions 
of both parties will have approved it. This is what Prime 
Minister Rabin had to say after signing the accord. 
  [Begin Rabin recording] I am happy that we agreed on a 
framework for a coalition agreement with SHAS. We initialed it 
tonight because it will go into effect only following two more 
stages. The first stage is approval by Labor institutions and 
SHAS Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef -- as long as they have not approved 
the document, it is an initialed framework -- and after that it 
will be presented for Knesset approval. [end recording] 
  At the signing ceremony, SHAS leader Arye Der'i hoped that 
the coalition would continue to expand. Any faction interested 
in joining the coalition is welcome, he said. 
  The coalition accord states that the agreement and 
appendices 
signed between the two parties in 1992, on the eve of the 
government's establishment, would continue to be valid, except 
for the amendments to the basic law. It also stipulates that 
SHAS will receive the Religious Affairs Ministry and the 
Interior Ministry, portfolios although it is still not clear 
whether they will have one minister or two. SHAS has also been 
promised two deputy ministers, which also has to be decided 
between the prime minister and Der'i.

  [Text] Israeli sources in Washington have expressed 
disappointment with what they say was a lukewarm response by the 
State Department spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, on the Israel 
Government's decision to outlaw Kakh and Kahana Hay. She was 
quoted as saying the decision should be seen as part of the 
overall effort Israel is making to meet Palestinian security 
concerns. She also said the United States is considering 
whether to put Kakh and Kahana Hay on its list of terrorist 
sponsors. Christine Shelly told reporters yesterday that Kakh 
and Kahana Hay, on the basis of their words and actions, have 
advocated and engaged in terrorism. Shelly added that U.S. law 
had provisions for curtailing fund-raising for such groups in 
the United States. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 15 March, 
in 
a similar report, adds that "Israel's Ambassador in Washington 
Itamar Rabinovich told our correspondent Arye Golan that senior 
State Department officials had reacted very positively to the 
steps taken by the Israeli Government in the wake of the Hebron 
massacre."]

  [Text] Five members of the Kakh and Kahana Hay movements 
are now in administrative detention. Two others have been 
arrested pending legal moves to hold them under administrative 
detention. However, Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who heads the 
authorities' wanted list, remains at large. Summing up the 
situation is reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  Currently in jail on a three-month administrative detention 
warrant are Shmu'el Ben-Yishay, Shmu'el Ben-Ya'aqov, Eyal Noqed, 
Bentziyon Gobstein, and No'am Federman, the spokesman for the 
Kakh movement. Kakh leader Barukh Marzel remains at large. He 
is the No. 1 wanted man at the moment, and his wife Sara told 
reporters today that she remains a declared Kakh activist and 
she taunted police to come and arrest her along with the wives 
of the other activists who are currently in administrative 
detention. Two people who are currently under arrest, but not 
in administrative detention are Barukh Ben-Yosef, a Kakh member, 
and Mikha'el Ben-Horin, a former Kakh member who is the 
self-styled president of the State of Judaea. Both these people 
must appear before a district court if they are going to be put 
in administrative detention. Ben-Horin appeared at the Nazareth 
District Court today. He was kept under arrest until next 
Sunday, when the court will decide whether in fact he will be 
put in administrative detention. Ben-Yosef is due to appear 
before the Jerusalem District Court tomorrow with regard to his 
case. 
  Another development today was the questioning by police of 
Rabbi Moshe Levinger of Hebron and his wife on charges that they 
had been involved in various disturbances several months ago in 
Hebron. Levinger is due to appear tomorrow in court to answer 
police charges. That is the situation at the moment. Police 
say that other arrests could well come in the days ahead but 
they are keeping very quiet on who it may be and where the 
arrests may take place.

the Syrian foreign minister approved the delegation's arrival; 
however, the delegation preferred to put off its departure to 
Damascus in the wake of the Hebron massacre. 
  Our correspondent's inquiries revealed that immediately 
after 
Basil al-Asad's death was reported in the media, Dr. al-Tibi, 
PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, sent a letter to Nayif 
Hawatimah in Damascus requesting permission to send a delegation 
to offer condolences on behalf of the Galilee Arabs. Dr. Ahmad 
al-Tibi also specified the names of the proposed members of the 
delegation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nahum Barne'a: "Goldstein's Victory"] </F>
  [Text] Sitting somewhere in hell's nether regions, if hell 
has any, Dr. Barukh Goldstein is looking down on the world and 
laughing. His personal operation has succeeded beyond all 
expectations. 
  The bullets he fired in Hebron kindled a fire in the Israeli 
Arab sector. He dreamed to prove that Yafo is Hebron. And so 
is Rahat. And Shefar'am. The Muslim world is also on fire. The 
fire is threatening peace, security, and the country's inner 
strength. You are now a shahid [Arabic for martyr], Goldstein. 
Our own shahid. How nice for you. 
  A tree alley leading nowhere was once planted behind the 
grocery store at the Qiryat Arba' entrance. It was named the 
Kahana Alley. Beyond the edge of the planted area was where your 
temporary grave was dug yesterday. All the village drunks and 
junkies will come to carouse around the grave at night, dancing 
and singing Blessed Be Messiah, Blessed Be He, until one of two 
things happens: Either you will be moved to the Jewish cemetery 
in the heart of Hebron, or Qiryat Arba' will be moved away. 
  Do you get it, Barukh? 
  They had heavy rains there yesterday, Barukh, and the rain 
obliterated the last traces of Purim makeup off the children's 
faces. Purim is over, and it left behind heaps of empty 
bottles, a headache, and grief. The Army has clamped a closure 
on Qiryat Arba'. The closure is rubbish, of course. We can 
easily drive nuts any poor soldier dazed by the many orders he 
has received. But the feeling of being blackballed is 
intolerable. Sodom and Gomorrah they call us. We, Kahanists, 
couldn't care less, but we feel awkward about the neighbors. 
  Yesterday the government decided to set up a state 
commission 
of inquiry. Rabin is angry. The Army is sweating buckets. The 
Army will try to blame you for everything: You came, shot, 
killed, were killed. But other charges will be brought forward 
all around. The right wing will try to argue that you did not 
just kill. That there were reasons. That there was a climate. 
That the government is to blame. Because in Israel, a man is 
never responsible for his acts: not for the Stock Exchange, not 
for the murder of a taxi driver, and definitely not for a mosque 
murder. 
  The media will suspect that the Army is tampering with the 
evidence. Proof: On Saturday, soldiers were brought in to 
scrub off all traces of the event in the cave. Proof: No one, 
except uniformed Army personnel, has seen the place to this very 
day. No one has been given official permission to talk to the 
soldiers who were on spot, no one but their commanders. 
Versions given out by the Army elevate you to Rambo's pedestal. 
Your single gun has killed a thousand people. You? It could 
be true, but it is unconvincing. 
  The Shin Bet, the Army, possibly the prime minister and 
defense minister will be asked by the commission to explain why 
we were permitted to do as we liked in Hebron, why we were 
permitted to wear uniforms, exercise authority, go unpunished. 
We will stand there as the guardians of enlightened justice and 
democracy. Administrative detention? Being discharged from the 
Army without a trial? Banishment? They are nothing. Dreifus 
will look silly compared to Marzel, and No'am Federman will be 
Emile Zola. Will you laugh! 
  At a certain point the commission will discover that we are 
just the tip of the iceberg. The rules of the game should be 
changed drastically. Not only in Qiryat Arba', throughout the 
territories. Before the state hands powers over to the PLO, it 
needs to recoup its powers from the settlers. Otherwise it will 
have nothing to hand over. How can a 20-year reality be changed 
now? Better give up the agreement. 
  Didn't Rabbi Kahana always say that the worse it gets, the 
better? He said it and you made it true. You set the Israeli 
Arabs and Jews against each other. That is good. You sowed 
dissension among Jews. That is wonderful. Now the entire 
settler population is identified with Rabbi Kahana. 
  You wiped out their coexistence illusion. They arranged a 
make-believe coexistence in the Cave of the Patriarchs, and you 
shot it to death. Very good. And you caused a lot of rational, 
decent Israelis to look at the bodies on television and say: 
Kudos to you. No more spilling of Jewish blood. And you did 
it, just you. 
  Therefore, we drink to your death, Goldstein. Rabbi Kahana 
said a little Kahanist hides inside each of us. Your death was 
his resurrection.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 14, (AFP)--Two Swedish 
journalists were injured in a car bomb attack near 'Aqrah in the 
Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq, Kurdish security 
forces said Monday [14 March]. 
  The two freelances were only slightly hurt in the explosion 
Sunday caused by a bomb packed with TNT attached to their car. 
  No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but the 
Kurdish driver of the car was arrested. 
  Recent attacks on foreigners have been blamed on the Iraqi 
government, opposed to foreign aid for the Kurds in the area, 
set up following the 1991 Gulf war.

<F P=106> ["Viewpoint" by Salah al-Mukhtar: "Will the Pope Visit </F>
Iraq?"] 
  [Text] In a noteworthy statement, Rafa'el I Bidawid, 
bishop of the Catholic Chaldeans in Iraq, has said that Pope 
John Paul II has promised to visit Iraq at the appropriate time. 
This statement is encouraging because the visit, even if made 
on purely humanitarian grounds, will implicitly reassert that 
the Pope and the Christian world reject U.S. Zionist schemes to 
touch off a new series of Crusades. 
  We cannot help but note the failure of the Bush 
administration to control the world in the name of the "new 
world order" and the fact that he had no choice but to admit 
that the world is drowning in chaos, crises, and challenges -- 
thus precluding the establishment of a new world order. This 
marked the collapse of one U.S. strategy and the prelude to the 
adoption of another horrifying and even more criminal option; 
namely, pushing the world into the holocaust of ethnic and 
religious wars, making them the bases for future conflicts. 
  Indeed, since the end of the seventies, U.S. policy has been 
based on creating and fueling ethnic and sectarian strife. 
Therefore, this is not a new policy. What, then, has the 
Clinton administration brought with it? The new element is that 
the scheme of creating crises is no longer a method to pressure 
or remove this or that regime in this or that country. It is 
now an attempt to redraw the map of world conflicts and their 
causes. In light of this, the "cultural motive" -- allegiances 
to religion or national culture -- will be the major cause of 
wars. 
  Consequently, future wars, if the United States gets its 
way, 
will be wars of conflicting cultures. Thus, Arab - Islamic - 
Confucian - Buddhist - Eastern cultures will be pitted against 
Western - Christian - Protestant - European cultures. Perhaps, 
Professor Samuel Huntington best explained the U.S. scheme in 
his research paper "Conflict of Cultures." 
  The fall of Bush and the rise of Clinton was not the only 
development that reflected a change in U.S. strategy. U.S. 
political thought also witnessed the death of one of the most 
short-lived and absurd of its theories -- the theory of the "end 
of history" propounded by U.S. researcher Francis Fokoyama. 
According to this theory, the history of conflict would end 
with the victory of U.S. liberalism. This theory lasted less 
than three years. It was buried along with Bush, pushing to the 
forefront the option of the "war of cultures," Huntington's 
theory, which contradicts the "end of history" theory. 
  The United States is now doing what the European feudal 
systems did in the Middle Ages when they sought to resolve their 
domestic economic crises by capturing the huge resources of the 
East. Thus, the Crusades were used as a cover to mobilize the 
simple-minded and conceal the true economic objectives of 
thievery. 
  The United States is now trying to ignite cultural, 
religious, and ethnic wars only to hide its failure and crisis 
and control a world worn out by wars and crises. 
  Hence, the Pope's crucial role. The Zionist United States is 
mobilizing Christian and Jewish public opinion against the Arabs 
and Muslims, as well as every other culture and religion. It is 
doing this to achieve economic and strategic objectives familiar 
to those in the know. It also seeks to ignite new Crusades. 
The Pope can, however, actively contribute to thwarting this 
criminal scheme of the West's capitalist states. 
  The new capitalist Crusade has chosen Iraq as a target of 
its 
malice. It is a major target for igniting new Crusades that 
will last for hundreds of years. It is doing this by harming 
Iraq so greatly that it will never be forgotten by Iraq, Arabs, 
or Muslims and thus become a motive for revenge. Despite Iraq's 
insistence on highlighting the nonreligious motives of this 
Western hostility to Arabs and Muslims, Iraq's efforts need the 
support of the "other camp," which the United States has 
nominated to launch wars against us. Hence, the role of the 
Pope in foiling the plan of pagan capitalism in the West. The 
very visit of the Pope to Iraq will send a clear message to all; 
namely, that Christianity is innocent of the greed of capitalism 
and its criminal plans, and that Islam and Christianity have 
peacefully coexisted for thousands of years. They can -- indeed 
they must -- continue to coexist peacefully. 
  The visit is also a message from the Pope to the Iraqi 
people 
saying: We are innocent of your suffering. We sympathize with 
you and wish the embargo would end. This way, we would fully 
immunize the Iraqi citizen against warped ideas and ensure, by 
his awareness and balanced thinking, that he will not be carried 
away by destructive conflicts. 
  This is how we view the Pope's visit and its importance. The 
timing of the visit is vital. The fact that it should precede 
the lifting of the embargo is extremely significant, because 
what is needed from this visit is encouragement for the 
"Christian world" to act in a more daring manner toward lifting 
the embargo and applying pressure toward this end. Will the 
Pope do it?

"Karmilites: Palestinian Blood, Whose Responsibility Is it?"] 
  [Text] The Dayr Yasir, Kafr Qasim, al-Aqsa, Sabra and 
Shatila, Nahr al-Barid, and al-Baddawi massacres weren't even 
close. Perhaps the Tall al-Za'tar massacre was, but what 
happened was a combination of all these massacres at once. It 
was the bloody Friday massacre that extended from Hebron to 
Gaza, Nabulus to Ramallah, and from the ocean to the gulf, 
enveloping the entire Arab homeland; a massacre that was the 
natural twin -- since it came from the same womb -- of the Hamah 
massacre in Syria in 1982 and the al-'Amiriyah shelter massacre 
in Baghdad in 1991. It was the massacre that drowned the faces, 
souls, bodies, policies, and the persons of the gathering of 
servility, humiliation, abandonment, concession, and 
normalization with the Zionist Jews -- the Hafr al-Batin 
gathering. 
  The Palestinian blood that filled the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
in 
Hebron was a bath from which none of those Zionist Arabs who 
shook hands with Zionist Jews will emerge. 
  It was a bloody massacre, drowning in eternal shame Hafiz 
al-Asad, Husni Mubaak, Fahd, Jabir, and all the others. They 
are responsible for the death of Iraqi children in their 
sickbeds in hospitals due to shortages of medicine and food. 
This is thanks to the blockade imposed by the savage 
civilization that has allowed the death of Muslims in Sarajevo 
and danced to the tune of Arab deaths from Somalia to Baghdad, 
via the West Bank and Gaza, to the remotest areas of the Earth, 
wherever people speak Arabic or recite the holy book in Arabic, 
because the Koran is Arab and Prophet Muhammad, may the peace 
and blessings of God be upon him, was an Arab. 
  This Palestinian blood is the curse of the righteous martyrs 
who fell in defense of the Allahu Akbar flag [Iraqi flag] and 
for the sake of justice, freedom, and human dignity. It is the 
curse of the martyrs on everyone who has betrayed their blood 
and generous sacrifices and disavowed the sacred slogans for 
which they died peacefully, knowing their blood will not be 
wasted. 
  This Palestinian blood is the responsibility of those who 
rushed to Madrid. 
  It is the responsiblity of those for whom Washington has 
become Mecca. 
  It is the responsibility of those who sold Arab national 
honor in the slave market between the walls of the Security 
Council and the Knesset. 
  Tell me, O nation of Muhammad; tell me, O free Arabs, what 
would have happened if Palestinians had attacked a Jewish 
synagogue and slain seventy and wounded 500 others in cold blood? 
  Nay, what would have happened had a faithful Arab government 
slain 10 debased traitors in broad daylight? Would it not have 
aroused the [Security] Council, human rights, and the new world 
order? In fact, armies would have moved, missiles would have 
been launched, and aircraft would have taken off to burn and 
destroy! 
  What peace, what normalization, and what agreements can 
there 
be with criminal racist murderers? Let God be our witness, 
whoever calls for or strives toward that will be directly 
responsible for every drop of Palestinian blood that has been, 
or is being, shed on the soil of the entire Arab homeland from 
the ocean to the gulf. 
  O pure blood, you are boiling in the veins. You are the 
moment of truth that burns the spiders web. O Palestinian 
blood, can we forget you? If we did, we would not be Arabs. 
Woe to us from our grandsons and conscience. Woe to us from 
our Arab blood which is calling us day and night: Revenge, 
revenge. Where is the Arab who forgets blood revenge?

<F P=106> [Article: "The Egyptian Regime's Despicable Pages in the </F>
30-State Aggression against Iraq" by Hadi Tu'mah] 
  [Text] When Husni Mubarak came to Baghdad in late July 1990 
reportedly to mediate between Iraq and al-Sabah [Kuwait] to calm 
the critical situation, U.S. talk about a so-called replacement 
for Iraq's political leadership had already figured in the 
policies of U.S. and Western propaganda media, which are largely 
controlled by Zionism. Leader President Saddam Husayn learned 
about and explained this to April Gelaspie, the U.S. ambassador 
in Baghdad, in late July 1990. 
  The economic and political conspiracy al-Sabah had 
coordinated with the U.S. Administration and the CIA to subvert 
the entire Iraqi national system, as clearly established in 
Kuwaiti documents, had already pushed Iraqi-Kuwait relations to 
the maximum state of tension, poisoned the entire political 
atmosphere in the region, and encouraged al-Sabah to go ahead 
with their plans. 
  The al-Sabah defense of the dividing line, which British 
colonialism had created with the stroke of a pen by its 
political resident Percy Cooks, was not the least of their aims 
in stirring up the conspiracy and trying to establish a fait 
accompli in the Iraqi side of the "patrols line", which the Arab 
League had defined during the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis in the 
sixties; the line which the president considered a determining 
factor for those violations. The al-Sabah set up on the Iraqi 
side of that line oil installations, border posts, and farms, as 
also mentioned in his excellency's talks with Gelaspie. 
  Given the al-Sabah's mobilization of their armed forces and 
the insistence on prejudicing Iraq's national and political 
honor, and the fact that Kuwaiti economic and U.S. political 
plotting had reached a serious stage, Iraq had to respond 
equally by moving its forces and using its legitimate right to 
foil the new plot, after its political efforts from 1989 until 
July 1990 met with deaf ears and strong stubbornness. Those 
efforts were wasted when al-Sabah did away with Arab fraternity 
and cooperation and resorted instead to the spirit of hostility 
and fighting. 
  It also became clear to Iraq that al-Sabah's attitude was 
not 
just a stubborn stand to carry out their wishes within Kuwait's 
limits, but a coordinated stand with the United States and its 
allies to plan a new war and to achieve what the plot of the 
Iranian aggression could not achieve. The aim of the new war 
was the same as that of the Iranian war, which was to push Iraq 
to scientific, industrial, and social backwardness, weaken it 
before the growing Zionist power, and force it to make political 
concessions which would restrict its free, independent course, 
end its advancement plan, and compel it to make concessions on 
its national soil and resources and stop opposing Camp David and 
its effects and any other similar step leading to the 
liquidation of the Palestine question. 
  Those were the demands the U.S. Administration had declared 
openly more than once, on an official level and in the 
U.S.-Zionist propaganda and news media. 
  What Iraq already knew was confirmed by the official 
correspondence between the director general of the State 
Security Department in Kuwait and the Iraqi interior: There was 
agreement and coordination with the CIA that al-Sabah and 
Washington would work together to put pressure on Iraq at the 
highest levels, pressure which would exploit Iraq's economic 
conditions after 8-year war. This was clearly mentioned in an 
official statement dated 22 November 1989 which Iraq deposited 
with the United Nations, which also considered it a correct, 
unblemished statement and included it among its documents 
  That agreement and coordination explain Jabir al-Sabah's 
arrogance and haughtiness in insisting on going to Jeddah under 
his own terms and asking Sa'd al-Sabah not to listen to anything 
else, because, as he said, "this is the opinion of our friends 
in Egypt, Washington, and London." 
  The position taken by Jabir and Sa'd was also that of the 
the United States, and Zionism, of course. The al-Sabah were 
used as pawns on the conspiratorial chess board. 
  As for Husni Mubarak, who used his good offices as a 
coverup, 
he played the mean role of escalating the tense, critical 
situation to the point of explosion, as ordered by those hostile 
quarters. This was obvious when he conveyed to Jabir al-Sabah 
an incomplete version of what the leader president confided to 
him when he said: "So long as the talks remain between Iraq and 
Kuwait, then I will not use force. But brother Husni, do not 
say this to the Kuwaitis since it will only make them more 
arrogant." The words conveyed by Husni that "Saddam Husayn will 
not attack Kuwait" were a clear plot to encourage the al-Sabah 
to go ahead with their hostile stand to spark off the 
U.S.-Zionist plot. 
  Due to the reassurance generated by Husni Mubarak's remark, 
Jabir al-Sabah went ahead with his conspiracy. His 
recommendations to Sa'd al-Sabah in his talks with the vice 
chairman of the Iraqi Revolution Command Council during their 
famous Jeddah meeting on 30 July 1990 were stubborn, like a 
solid, jagged rock. Husni Mubarak's remark, plus Jabir 
al-Sabah's determination to ride the conspiratorial train, which 
was backed by U.S. engines and military might, was the main 
reason for the failure of the Jeddah talks and al-Sabah's 
defiance and threat that international forces would compel Iraq 
to respond to their demands. 
  That was the visible part of the conspiracy, which had other 
hidden parts. The political observer could not but note these 
serious, major developments, especially the political propaganda 
campaign which Western governments and world Zionism had waged 
in the media against Iraq in general and leader President Saddam 
Husayn in person since 8 August 1988. The aims of this 
propaganda were summed up by a U.S. Congressional delegation led 
by Senator Dole in April 1990, as follows: Iraq should revise 
its scientific program and industrial advancement on the pretext 
that it threatens Iraqi interest and peace in the region; stop 
making threats to the Zionist entity, although it threatened 
Iraq; and contribute actively and constructively toward the 
current peace process between Israel and the representatives of 
the Palestinians. 
  Those exactly were the hidden reasons behind al-Sabah's 
insistence on riding the train of the oil conspiracy, which 
steamed off with U.S. motivation and Zionist instigation under 
the slogan of demanding: 1) Demarcation of the border according 
to the new violations. 2) Payment of debts! 
  In all cases, the aim was one, namely, enforcing the demands 
of U.S.-Zionist policy as summed up by Senator Dole. But what 
was not secret to analysts, and it must not remain secret to 
anyone now that the war took place with the 30-state aggression, 
was what the hostile circles had decided, which was to push Iraq 
to the state of the blockade it is in now. This blockade 
actually began with the decision of the U.S. Congress earlier in 
1990 to cancel the food deals with Iraq. This was followed by 
the imposition of the scientific and technological embargo, 
whether or not the war took place, rather whether we behaved in 
a manner that befitted free men, or followed the path of 
defeatism and cowardice. 
  What was required in all cases was to stop Iraq's 
advancement project and thus affect people's progress and 
prosperity, spoil the peace and victory the Iraqi people enjoyed 
after 8 August 1988, and block the growing popularity of Iraq 
which, with time, would become a popular unity base. This was 
what the imperialist states and Zionism had feared because it 
meant foiling their infinitesimal plan against the unity of the 
Arab homeland, ending the divisions, and consolidating the march 
of confrontation against Zionist aggression and its settler 
arrogance. That was what Iraq had achieved in a striking 
manner, particularly after 8 August 1988. 
  Therefore, al-Sabah's insistence was not spontaneously based 
on a balance of power or a demand for legitimate rights. Any 
observer could easily see that al-Sabah's small size and 
challenge was no match to Iraq's new weight. The fact is, the 
insistence stemmed from the opinion of Egypt, Washington, and 
London! 
  Consequently, the Jeddah talks had to fail, and Iraq found 
itself compelled to crush the den of sinful plotting which 
sought in every mean way to involve Iraq in a war of starvation 
and humiliation, similar in results to what we are in now, 
especially after Iraq had proved its competence in the armed war 
against the Zionist entity in 1973 and against Iran from 1980 to 
1988. The al-Sabah were in no position to engage in one percent 
of such a war and still remain on their thrones, even for a few 
hours. 
  On 2 August 1990, while the Arab foreign ministers were 
meeting in Cairo, Husni Mubarak, to quote Muhammad Hasanayn 
Haykal, was reading a situation report prepared by his office 
with the cooperation of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry and 
General Intelligence. The main points and recommendations of 
that report were as follows: 
  - Iraq's entry into Kuwait was a blow to Egyptian interests 
on more than one level, both with regard to its direct interests 
and its leading position in the Arab World; a position which the 
Egyptian Government was determined to hold on to, even if in the 
disgraceful Camp David abyss. 
  - It was necessary for Egypt to mobilize the entire Arab 
world in order to exercise maximum political pressure on 
Baghdad. This could be done through a meeting of Arab foreign 
ministers. 
  The report, which gave tacit approval to U.S. intervention 
in 
advance, also reached other conclusions. It said, verbatim: 
  - It is better for U.S. intervention in the crisis to be 
carried out, step by step, otherwise it will give Iraq the 
chance to arouse the Arab public, which was what the U.S. 
Administration had actually done throughout the six and one-half 
months before the military aggression. 
  - A clear message must be sent to the Zionist entity asking 
it not to get involved in the crisis to avoid complicating 
matters, making the solution difficult. This point was made 
several times and recommended for implementation. 
  While Husni Mubarak was reading these recommendations, which 
seem to have been drawn up before 2 August 1990, Tel Aviv radio 
was lamenting the loss of "fraternal Kuwait." The Zionist 
entity was holding contacts with Washington to coordinate on how 
to face the situation, especially since Tel Aviv had its own 
aggressive plan against Iraq, which was to have been implemented 
before July 1990 if it had not been for the deterrent Iraqi 
threat made by leader President Saddam Husayn in April 1990, and 
had it not also been for Washington's fears about its "vital 
interests" in the region in case of an outbreak of war sparked 
by Zionist aggression. The Zionist entity's cabinet held an 
emergency meeting in the same afternoon to discuss urgent 
matters. Thus, the Zionist entity and Husni Mubarak seemed to 
be pursuing the same line, carrying out the economic plot by 
armed force under the cover of double-dealing and the policy of 
selective revenge 
  At the time when the Zionist entity was hoping military 
action against Iraq would be carried out by the big powers on 
behalf of the small states, contrary to previous practice, Husni 
Mubarak was preparing the atmosphere in the lobbies of the Arab 
League to find a "legal" cover for the entry of U.S. forces and 
its allies in the Arabian Peninsula, which would be the base for 
aggression on Iraq. Without such a base, the United States 
would be fighting a war similar in results to the war in 
Vietnam, according to Bush and his followers. Wiping out the 
Vietnamese complex had been Bush's obsession for some time. It 
occupied a significant place in his inauguration speech. In 
fact, he often mentioned the subject after 2 August 1990 and 
during the armed aggression. Husni Mubarak gave him this 
priceless opportunity when he violated the Arab League Charter 
by resorting to a formal vote instead of the unanimous vote 
required by the charter in such cases. That was his biggest 
crime against the entire nation, as certified by all Arab 
delegations. 
  Egyptian Housing and Reconstruction Minister Hasaballah 
al-Kafrawi was very clear in his statement to AL-MUSAWWAR on 29 
March 1991 when he admitted the importance of the treacherous 
role played by the Hafr al-Batin allies and the sinful 
aggression they committed against Iraq, and therefore the Arab 
nation. He said, verbatim: "Were it not for the position taken 
by Husni Mubarak, there would not have been any Kuwait or UN 
Security Council resolutions today. Kuwait, the Gulf, and Saudi 
Arabia would have complained to the Security Council and entered 
into endless complications and interpretations, as in the case 
of the Palestine question, which has been in the United Nations 
since 1948, and will be, perhaps, forever. Were it not for 
Mubarak also, the United States -- the biggest power in history 
and in our modern world -- would not have been able to intervene 
under any excuse. And if it did, there would have been another 
Vietnam or a Crusader war. The one who gave it legality was 
President Mubarak! And the one who made King Fahd invite the 
U.S. forces was President Mubarak." 
  There is no doubt then that Husni was the one who gave 
legality to the United States and the allied forces to intervene. 
  Whoever claims that Egypt's role was marginal does not 
understand the course of events. Egypt was the one that created 
the Gulf war and the one that returned Kuwait. 
  This dirty role the Egyptian housing and reconstruction 
minister boasted about was, in fact, a treasonous role that 
Husni Mubarak played, and is still playing, for Washington and 
Camp David. 
  As for the story about the United States canceling Egypt's 
debts, which amounted to $7 billion, those debts were actually 
repaid from Arab oil money, not by the U.S. Treasury, according 
to a decision by war criminal Bush and other members of his 
coalition and agents.

  [Text] Nicosia, March 14 (AFP)--Iranian forces launched 
missiles against Kurdish border villages in northern Iraq 
causing damage but no casualties, Iranian opposition forces said 
on Monday. 
  The Iranian National Resistance Council (INRC) said in a 
statement that the homes in Iraq of families connected to the 
Iraq-based Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) were destroyed in 
the attack on Friday. 
  However the report could not been confirmed by independent 
sources. 
  The KDP, which is the main Kurdish opposition to the Tehran 
regime has bases in Kurd areas in northern Iraq, many of them 
near the border with Iran. 
  Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the INRC and leader of the 
People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization], the main 
armed opposition to Tehran based in Iraq, denounced what the 
press statement termed a "criminal and terrorist attack". 
  He called on the UN Security Council to take measures 
urgently "to prevent the slaughter of the Iranian people and of 
the population of Kurdistan". 
  The INRC was founded in 1981 and brings together the 
People's 
Mojahedin and other closely-related Iranian opposition groups.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Strategy of Dual Containment"] </F>
  [Text] Clinton and the Democratic Administration have 
assessed and approved a policy of dual containment toward Iran 
and Iraq that is based on a series of restrictions and 
pressures. Even though there is no uniformity between Iran and 
Iraq, it appears that the Clinton administration has been forced 
to adopt such a policy to extricate itself from its 
decisionmaking impasse. 
  Speaking in favor of this policy, Clinton's adviser for 
Middle Eastern affairs, Martin Indyk, who is considered the 
formulator of the policy of dual containment and restriction, 
says: In the past our policy was to give one of the two 
countries, that is Iran and Iraq, greater preference over the 
other. We are now in a situation where we should learn a 
lesson from the past and should study and adopt a suitable 
strategic stance on the Persian Gulf. Reliance on the strength 
and capabilities of one of the two countries to restrict the 
other and to maintain a balance of power has proved to be an 
erroneous policy. 
  Today, such an equilibrium can be satisfactory and in 
conformity with U.S. national interests if it restrains both the 
countries. 
  Martin Indyk believes that the dissolution of the Soviet 
Union, the reduction of the political and military strength of 
Iran in the eight-year war with Iraq, and the direct presence of 
the United States in the Persian Gulf have created conditions 
that allow the United States to bring about a balance without 
Iran or Iraq having any direct intervention in the region. 
  In his criticism of the policy of dual containment, U.S. 
political expert Graham Fowler has said that the aforementioned 
policy will not be beneficial. The United States tends to 
greatly exaggerate the dangers from Iran and the current U.S. 
policy needs to be reviewed and reappraised. 
  Fowler says: At present we are confronted with an Islamic 
Republic in the Middle East, but in the future there will be 
more such republics and we cannot make any innovations in our 
policy that we cannot continue in the future. Our (U.S.) 
current policy is very shortsighted. 
  According to Fowler, the formulation of a balanced policy in 
which there is a collection of friends and enemies is not a 
difficult task, but the balance of power in the aftermath of the 
Cold War needs assessment, study, and thought within the new 
framework. The United States should formulate its strategy in a 
manner in which the Persian Gulf countries can resolve their 
security issues without much dependence on that country and U.S. 
interests can be safeguarded. 
  Fowler says that Iran and Iraq have policies that are 
different from those of the United States, and they are also 
different from one another in relation to their respective 
situations. Iraq is a country with unchanging policies, which 
have not evolved completely, and is being administered by a 
ruthless individual. However, Iran is a country undergoing 
change and freedom and abundance is evident. Therefore, it would 
be fallacious for the United States to adopt a uniform policy 
for both countries.

  [Text] Iran's Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati in 
an interview with the Arabic weekly AL-WASAT and daily AL-SHARQ, 
based in Qatar, released simultaneously yesterday, has once 
again stressed Tehran's desire to resolve the misunderstanding 
over the three Iranian islands in the Gulf. 
  This is not for the first time that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran has spoken of its inclination for talks with the officials 
of the UAE [United Arab Emirates], its neighbor in the south of 
the Persian Gulf region. As the history of the case shows, 
since the postponement of talks between Tehran and the UAE 
concerning the dispute over Abu Musa island, which were 
scheduled to be pursued last September simultaneous with the 
Tehran visit of the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, 
Iran has welcomed any move that may remove the ambiguities 
existing in this regard. 
  Therefore, in the opinion of political observers, the 
Iranian 
foreign minister's invitation to the UAE officials to travel to 
Tehran and resumption of bilateral talks on the disputed matters 
in fact is rated as the reiteration of Tehran's postures 
vis-a-vis regional issues. The move is also viewed as Iran's 
firm determination to preserve stability and to bolster security 
in the region. 
  It is, however, indisputable that from the viewpoint of 
Tehran, the rift over the disputed islands is resolvable through 
direct contacts, and that acceptable results can be obtained 
through holding bilateral talks. Despite this, it appears that 
the subject of dispute between Iran and the UAE at certain 
junctures has been affected by the infusion [as heard] and doubt 
caused by Western political circles, thus being led to a 
direction repugnant to the recognized international principles 
and reciprocal good neighborliness among regional states. This 
trend has not only failed to help resolve the matter in the 
past, but with the assertion of controversial subject the 
slowing of the pace of talks between these two countries and 
finally their severance. 
  At any rate, the Islamic Republic of Iran, based on the fact 
that tension in the region is not in the interest of anyone, has 
constantly sought that regional states, by duly discerning the 
existing realities and conditions at greater depth, consider 
ways for resolving their issues on a regional basis. In such 
case the neighboring states are expected to amicably settle any 
dispute that may exist between Iran and the UAE. In this 
regard, Iran thinks the renewed visits by the officials of the 
two countries and the resumption of bilateral talks as the most 
logical solution for both sides. In particular, it appears at 
present that in view of the general understanding which governs 
Iran's cooperation with the Persian Gulf littoral states, 
attainment of a peaceful solution to the dispute with the UAE is 
not something problematic and remote from expectations.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Zionist Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin arrived in 
Washington today, Monday, on an official visit to the United 
States, during which he will hold talks with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, focusing primarily on the resumption of the Middle East 
peace talks and ways of ending the standoff between the Zionist 
entity and the PLO. 
  The Israeli prime minister's visit to Washington comes on 
the 
heels of the Zionist government's decision yesterday to outlaw 
the activities of the racist, extremist Kakh and Kahana Hay 
groups. 
  Political observers view Rabin's reported agreement to allow 
nonmilitary international observers in the occupied territories 
merely as a cosmetic measure to remedy the current crisis in 
Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  Meanwhile the UN Security Council continues its discussions 
on a prospective resolution condemning the two-week-old Zionist 
criminal massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. Indications show 
that the United States is seeking a resolution that will not 
adversely affect the peace process and, at the same time, 
refrain from accusing or condemning the Zionist entity to the 
extent it deserves. 
  It was clear from the start that Washington and Tel Aviv 
were 
trying hard to suggest that the Hebron crime was an act by an 
individual act to relieve Tel Aviv of responsibility for it. 
  Although the U.S. President showed some sensitivity about 
the 
slaughter of Palestinians in Hebron and condemned the crime, he 
still believes that the Arab-Israeli peace process is a much 
more important issue. According to political experts, his 
insistence on resuming the Arab and Palestinian talks with 
Israel stems from the widespread anxiety that opposition to this 
bargaining is growing throughout the region. 
  In light of the Zionist entity's character, this question 
becomes necessary: Will resuming the peace process remedy the 
Palestinian security problem in the occupied territories? 
  Judging by the Zionist entity's acts, its 
settlement-building 
policy, and its arming of Jewish immigrants, the answer cannot 
be yes. This is particularly true because these inhuman 
activities enjoy blatant U.S. support.

  [Text] Vienna, March 14, IRNA -- Iran respects the 
decisions and wishes of the people as well as those of an 
independent Bosnia-Herzegovinan [B-H] Government, says Mahmoud 
Vaezi, Iran's deputy foreign minister in charge of Euro-American 
affairs. 
  Welcoming the decreasing trend of bloodshed in the Balkans, 
Vaezi in an interview with Iran [as received] here Monday 
expressed hope for a peaceful solution to the B-H crisis and 
called on the international community for assistance. 
  According to Vaezi, the Balkan crisis has reached a point 
where most countries want to see an end to the conflict. 
  He also noted that the Russians could play a decisive role 
aimed at ending the B-H conflict. 
  Vaezi, on a tour of European countries, held talks on Sunday 
with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic who is here for the 
Muslim-Croatian federation talks. 
  The Iranian deputy foreign minister also said that during 
his 
talks with Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister had thanked 
Iran for its humanitarian aid to the people of B-H, and 
expressed hope that the Serbians would also join the federation 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "In Quest of a New Role"] </F>
  [Text] It is over 15 months since a virtual coup was 
staged and Russian puppets took over in the Muslim-inhabited 
Republic of Tajikistan. For months the Persian-speaking Tajik 
people witnessed the catastrophic crimes perpetrated by the 
Russian forces and antipopular government of Uzbekistan [as 
published] in the country. 
  In this period, tens of thousands of Muslim men, women, 
youth, and children, have been dragged into blood and dust and 
the call to prayer has been snuffed out in most parts of the 
country. Theological schools have been closed down and most of 
the intelligentsia, writers, clerics, and university staff 
members have been martyred or arrested. Hundreds of thousands 
of people have been rendered homeless in the debilitating winter 
and are wandering in mountains and wildernesses. Most of the 
people are being shot with a hail of bullets before the eyes of 
their families merely for belonging to a certain tribe or 
district and the cities of Tajikistan have become the tramping 
ground for murderers and ruffians who enjoy Russian support. 
  Even though the Western mass media has boycotted all news of 
events in Tajikistan in a coordinated measure, some reports 
squeeze through the cracks and tell of the depth of savagery and 
brutality of the former communists and supporters of Russia. 
There is no doubt that the Russian Government has had the main 
role in the events in Tajikistan in the past year. 
  The people of Tajikistan will not forget Russia's 
obstructionism in preventing fuel and foodstuffs from reaching 
Dushanbe during the brief period that a popular government was 
in power in Tajikistan. The Tajiks are well aware that the 
puppet regime -- which right from the outset has brought nothing 
for the people but poverty, hunger, misfortune, killing, and 
plunder -- cannot survive even for a day without Russian support. 
  Following the UN's announcement of the 16 March date for 
talks between the leaders of national Islamic groups of 
Tajikistan with the ruling regime and the Russian Government, 
Russia is seeking to wrest the initiative and to direct the 
talks toward its own longterm interests. 
  It is being said that the Russian first deputy foreign 
minister has been in Iran for a few days and has had talks with 
the leaders of some Islamic national Tajik groups. Reports of 
these meetings were carried in some foreign media and in some 
Moscow publications. However, the officials of our Foreign 
Ministry have apparently not deemed it necessary to disseminate 
the news of these talks inside Iran as well! The Russian first 
deputy foreign minister has made immense efforts to convince the 
Tajik leaders to accept Moscow as the venue for the talks but 
they seem to have expressed a preference for Tehran or Islamabad. 
  The Russians, who have played the main part in creating the 
present situation in Tajikistan, are now seeking to assume a new 
role of a mediator between the Tajik Government and opposition 
while retaining the role of big brother. The latest reports 
indicate that the Tajik group leaders have agreed that the first 
round of talks should begin on 16 March in Moscow. 
  Our Tajik brothers and sisters should maintain as strong a 
stance in the talks as they displayed during their rightful 
struggle and should not succumb to the blackmail and whipping up 
of any kind of atmosphere. Undoubtedly, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran will not forget the oppressed Muslims of Tajikistan in 
these difficult days and will -- as has been stressed repeatedly 
by the leader of the Revolution, His Eminence Ayatollah 
Khamene'i -- support their just aspirations to attain freedom 
and independence.

  [Text] Tehran, March 14, IRNA -- The English daily `TEHRAN 
TIMES' here Monday suggested that an argumentative but active 
parliament will be more advantageous for Kazakhstan than a 
passive and static one. Commenting on the parliamentary 
elections in Kazakhstan, the daily said in its editorial that 
official election results published last Thursday indicate that 
23 out of 177 of the elected parliamentarians belong to 
political parties which do not fully support President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's political ideology. 
  "It is too early to judge Kazakhstan's election results, but 
apparently one of the major elements which has gained access to 
the legislature is made up of 60 independent representatives." 
It said that Nazarbayev's Popular Union Party has sent 20 
members to the parliament. 
  Turning to the dilemma the newly independent states of the 
former Soviet Union are faced the daily said, "while they are 
afraid that relaxing social and political restrictions may 
endanger their political stability, their memories of decades of 
dictatorship and political suppression compels them to at least 
flirt with the idea of democracy." It further added that 
Kazakhstan is more sensitive to this dilemma than the rest of 
the newly independent republics. 
  The daily stressed that western powers attached special 
importance to Kazakhstan because of being the fourth largest 
atomic power in the world and because of its unique 
geo-political situation, being located between the three great 
regional powers of China, Russia and India. 
  Stressing that Russia is not the only country which keeps a 
close eye on Kazakhstan's affairs, due to the fact that Russians 
form the largest minority in Kazakhstan, the daily concluded by 
saying that all other regional countries have also an interest 
in Kazakhstan's actions.

  [Text] Tehran, March 14 (AFP) -- A radical Iranian daily on 
Monday criticised the government for pressuring Pakistan into 
withdrawing a UN resolution condemning India's human rights 
record in Kashmir. 
  "Given India's black record in Kashmir, is it possible to 
absolve New Delhi of the savage killing of men, women and 
children?" asked Jomhuri-e Eslami, close to Islamic hardliners. 
Had the intervention been in the "long-term interest of a 
Moslem nation and the liberation movements in Kashmir?" 
  The daily urged the foreign ministry to explain the logic 
behind the intervention to the Kashmiri people in order to 
"reassure them that Iran has made no changes in its position." 
  Islamabad dropped the resolution to be put before the UN 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva at the last minute Wednesday 
after pressure from Iran, China and other countries. 
  The initial draft resolution proposed that the commission 
express "its grave concern at the gross and consistent 
violations of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir." 
  On Thursday, a Moslem rebel group in Kashmir charged the 
Iranian stand on the disputed state had been an about-turn. 
  More than 8,500 people have died in Kashmir since 1989 when 
Moslem militants stepped up a bloody campaign for succession.

  [Text] Tehran, March 15, IRNA -- Iran's Islamic 
Consultative Assembly (Majlis) here Monday discussed points in 
the next year budget bill referred to by the Council of 
Guardians as incorrect and made amendments in order to receive 
the Council's final approval. 
  The Council of Guardians had found faults with the bill 
concerning articles 52th and 53 of the Constitution. It had 
also referred to some of the notes in the bill as ambiguous and 
against Islamic law. According to the 53th article of the 
Constitution the whole money the government gains is 
concentrated in the state treasury and all payments are 
performed on the basis of the approved credits and according to 
the law. 
  Article 52 says that the country's annual budget should be 
proposed by the government as stipulated by the law and should 
be submitted to the Majlis for deliberations and approval. Any 
change in the figures should be according to the law as well. 
  After the Majlis completed debates over the next year budget 
bill in its open session Wednesday, the bill was sent to the 
Council of Guardians for final approval. The Council, after 
some study, returned the bill to the Majlis to correct the 
faults. 
  The Majlis did some amendments to the bill in its Saturday 
session but the council regarded the amendments as insufficient 
and retured the bill to the Majlis for the second time.

  [Text] 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Islamic 
Majles, held a news conference this morning attended by domestic 
and foreign correspondents. During this news conference the 
Majles speaker referred to particular features of the coming 
year's [beginning 21 March] budget bill, saying: By allocating 
a greater subsidy to essential goods, the vulnerable strata will 
be protected better. Our foreign currency commitments will be 
reduced, greater attention will be paid to deprived areas, 
villages, the scientific, cultural and defense sectors. Income 
and expenditure will become more realistic. 
  In reply to a question asked by a correspondent on the 
comments made by a U.S. official about holding talks with Iran, 
Nateq-Nuri stressed: America's performance has always been 
contradictory and so far this performance has not shown any 
indication of that country's good intentions that can be trusted. 
  On the main obstacles on the path of improving ties with 
Egypt, he termed the Egyptian Government as the biggest obstacle 
in this field. He added: The Egyptian Government cannot see the 
people's Islam-seeking morale.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] At his news conference today 
Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri replied to a correspondent's question 
about remarks made recently by a U.S. official on talks with 
Iran. Nateq-Nuri stressed: America's performance has always 
been in contradiction with such remarks, and thus far this 
performance has not been in a manner to demonstrate that 
country's good intention, and which can be trusted. He 
stressed: As long as America maintains its hegemonistic and 
aggressive nature, we will continue our struggle. 
  On biased western propaganda alleging that Iran is striving 
to build nuclear weapons, the head of the legislative branch 
said: All international organizations and forums, particularly 
the International Atomic Energy Agency which has inspected our 
country's installations, have declared that there is no evidence 
to show that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. We use 
our installations to generate power. 
  About the main obstacles along the path of improving ties 
with Egypt, Nateq-Nuri replied to the correspondent's question 
by describing the Egyptian Government as the biggest obstacle 
along the path of upgrading these relations. Referring to the 
Egyptian Government's opposition to the Islam-seeking and 
Islam-supporting wave in that country, the Majles speaker added: 
The Egyptian Government cannot see the people's Islam-seeking 
mentality and blames Iran for provocation. 
  On Iran's relations with other Asian countries, particularly 
China and India, the Majles speaker emphasized: We wish to 
establish ties and unity with all other countries, except Israel 
and the United States, and we believe this unity will serve the 
interests of us all.

  [Text] Tehran, March 14, IRNA -- Iran exported over dlrs. 
310 million worth of steel within the past 11 months, said an 
official of National Iranian Steel Company here Monday. Musa 
Aqa'i Lankarani, the company's plan and project deputy, told 
IRNA that one million tons of steel products had also been 
exported over the current year. Pointing out that Iranian steel 
was highly demanded by world market for being produced of best 
raw materials, Lankarani remarked that China, Thailand, 
Phillipine and Taiwan were among the purchasers of the Iranian 
steel. 
  Iran would also export its steel to the Persian Gulf Arab 
states in the near future, he continued. He further noted that 
the plan for the development of steel industry in Iran was under 
serious study, saying that Iran was planning to increase the 
capacity of its existing steel units. 
  According to Lankarani, two steel plants with the annual 
capacity of 350,000 and 550,000 tons each would be established 
in the northeastern province of Khorasan and northwestern 
province of Azarbaijan in future. On privatization policies, 
the deputy commented that the trend had begun since two years 
ago and that so far more than 10 units had been transferred to 
the private sector.

Esfahan to Yazd has been completed. According to a report from 
our correspondent, this pipeline comprises two separate 
sections, which start from Kuhpayeh, and after crossing the 
regions of Na'in, Haqda, Ardakan, Meybod, Ashk-e Zar, and Zarch 
reaches the city of Yazd. 
  The Housing Development of the Oppressed and the War 
Disabled

<F P=106> ["AL-THAWRAH Issues" column by Muhammad 'Ali Buzah: "Saving </F>
the Peace Process"] 
  [Text] It was natural, after the atrocity and horror of the 
Ibrahimi Mosque crime, for the Washington bilaterals to stop and 
for the Arab delegations to suspend these talks in protest 
against the massacre and in solidarity with the Palestinian Arab 
people. 
  It is neither logical nor acceptable for the negotiation 
process to remain at Israel's mercy and captive to its military 
madness and bloody crimes. The Arabs cannot negotiate from a 
position of commitment to the peace process and abidance by its 
terms of reference, which are based on respect for and execution 
of the resolutions of international legitimacy, while Israel is 
free of any restriction or commitment, carrying out savage 
massacres and attacks on defenseless Palestinians and Lebanese 
and dealing blows to peace and its chances of success. 
  Israel is practicing open organized terrorism, waging a war 
of annihilation and ruination, slaughtering, attacking, and 
burning Arab lands -- all in the name of peace and under its 
banner. Yet, no one can object or utter a word of justice or 
protest in order that Israel's feelings are not hurt and the 
peace process is not jeopardized. On the other hand, the Arabs 
-- and no one else -- are expected to show flexibility, exercise 
self-restraint, and endure blows and strikes in order to 
maintain "the acquired" momentum for the continuation of the 
peace process. It is as if the Arabs are the only side 
concerned about this process and it must therefore pay the price 
by rewarding Israel, making concessions that entrench its 
usurpation of Arab lands and rights, and submitting to Israel's 
wishes and hegemony. 
  This rather strange and ridiculous Western paradox can be 
seen clearly if we were to reverse the situation and place 
Israel in the Arabs' position. We could see Israel receiving 
the blows and being subjected to daily air raids and bombing 
with the most up to date weapons of mass destruction. We could 
replace the massacres in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and 
in the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah with a massacre in a 
Jewish synagogue -- even if Jewish deaths were only one tenth of 
either of the two massacres -- where the perpetrator was a lone 
Arab "lunatic." What if there were events similar to the types 
that Israel carried out when it burned al-Aqsa Mosque and 
carried out the massacres of "Rotschilion," Sabra and Shatila, 
Qibyah, Dayr Yasin, Hebron, and Zuq Mikhail. Just imagine what 
would have happened! 
  Certainly, Western and American reactions would not have 
been 
in the form of such bashful condemnations and denunciations, 
which mean nothing and do nothing to console the bereaved. The 
whole world would have been turned against the Arabs. They 
would have been castigated and branded with all forms of 
medieval terrorism and barbarism. Moreover, the nations of the 
world would have rushed to Israel's assistance and used all 
their expertise to obtain sanctions and use all kinds of 
pressure against the Arabs. In fact, the entire Arab world, 
from the ocean to the Gulf, would not have been enough for 
Israel's aggression, reprisals, and revenge for its soldier and 
settler victims. 
  No doubt, the ugliness and atrocity of the Hebron crime has 
changed many concepts, making it difficult to continue with or 
return to the bilaterals as if nothing has happened. Thus, it 
has become incumbent on the international community and the U.S. 
sponsor to punish the aggressor and to firmly confront Israel's 
aggressiveness and curb its open lust for murder, blood, and 
massacres. 
  Saving the peace process and the stumbling talks 
necessitates 
exerting all forms of pressure in order to force Israel to 
submit to the resolutions and conventions of international 
legitimacy, to respect human rights, to remove the settlements, 
to disarm the settlers, who are a mine field in the way of 
peace, and to compel its rulers to acknowledge Arab lands and 
full rights without delay.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Samir Ja'ja', leader of the </F>
Lebanese Forces, in Ghidras by unidentified correspondent in 
Beirut on 11 March] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] How is the situation today? 
  [Ja'ja'] Instead of quoting our sources, come to us and see 
for yourself, then you can write about what you are going to see 
all the way to my residence in Ghidras. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that there are roadblocks? 
  [Ja'ja'] The issue is not the number of roadblocks or the 
troops, but the manner in which they are deployed along the 
roads leading to Ghidras. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Have you contacted His Excellency President Ilyas 
al-Hirawi? 
  [Ja'ja'] No, I have not contacted him so far. He was busy 
yesterday with the breakfast banquet he gave in B'abda Palace. 
  [AL-HAYAH] And why have you not contacted him today 
(yesterday) [11 March]? 
  [Ja'ja'] We do not want to disturb his excellency with this 
issue. We are leaving him to concentrate on the main issue, 
that is the Middle East negotiations. 
  [AL-HAYAH] And with the Army command? 
  [Ja'ja'] There are no contacts with the command. The 
contacts are made with some authoritative officers in the area. 
They reply that this presence lies within security deployments 
in the provinces. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] The Army has been deployed in Ghidras for a long 
time. 
  [Ja'ja'] The nearest point to Ghidras was less than a 
kilometer away. This point was concealed and not on the main 
road. We asked the Army command at the time about this point's 
task. We were told that its job was to supervise the valley. 
  [AL-HAYAH] And what is happening now? 
  [Ja'ja'] The Army is deployed in five directions: a point 
is set up in each direction. There is a point on the road 
leading to here. 
  [AL-HAYAH] It is said that the measures include all areas, 
and that security units have lists of suspects involved in the 
bombing incidents. 
  [Ja'ja'] Fine. Let them come and tell us who they are, and 
I am prepared to hand them over. Why overtake events when the 
investigation is under way? [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] It is reported that they have lists of suspects 
involved in security incidents, including an attempt on the 
president's life, and that the accusation is leveled at Raji 
'Abdu, nicknamed the "captain." 
  [Ja'ja'] Raji 'Abdu is not accused in the case concerning 
his excellency the president. He was accused of bombing the 
Rumyah barracks. Anyhow, his case is now in the hands of the 
Lebanese judiciary. When a verdict is passed and it becomes 
clear whether he has any link, they will see whether or not we 
are going to hand him over. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mahmud Marzuq: "Protecting the Palestinians </F>
is a Firm Egyptian Demand"] 
  [Excerpt] In a recent interview with an Arab newspaper, 
President Husni Mubarak affirmed that Egypt consistently backs 
the Palestinians and supports their demand to disarm the 
settlers. He voiced profound sorrow and regret over the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, stressing the need to agree on 
measures that guarantee Palestinian security in the occupied 
territories. 
  The Egyptian diplomatic establishment, with its well-known 
expertise and Arab and international influence, has succeeded in 
using the hideous crime perpetrated by Jewish extremists inside 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque to exert great pressure on Israel in the 
negotiations and has exploited the international condemnation of 
the act by demanding stronger powers for Palestinian autonomy. 
Egypt did not limit itself to denunciations but used the crime 
to promote the desired strategic solution. 
  Over the past few days President Mubarak contacted the 
leaders of many countries influential in the peace operation to 
convince them of the danger threatening the peace, which is 
illustrated by settlers with expansionist delusions in the 
Palestinian territories who perpetrate crimes against the 
Palestinians. These crimes are reaching new heights that 
adversely affect regional peace efforts and provoke popular Arab 
and Islamic wrath against Israel, as happened after the 
appalling Hebron incident. 
  An Arab and international consensus exists that the 
Palestinians need urgent international protection. Mubarak 
found responsive ears and international willingness to examine 
the issue of providing protection for the Palestinians inside 
the occupied territories, including the prompt adoption of 
actual measures for this purpose because no political power is 
worth anything without actual power to defend it. 
  When President Mubarak tells the Arab press that it is 
important to resume the peace negotiations and protect the 
Palestinians, he is actually stating that the most important 
reason to accept the peace agreement is to end the hardships of 
the Palestinians inside the occupied territories, as they are 
subject to military repression and face injustices at the hands 
of settlers. An immediate return to the negotiating table is 
necessary to prevent the extremist settlers from benefiting by 
their crime, which aimed to undermine the peace process. 
  It is necessary to be reasonable and determine where 
Palestinian interests lie: in suspending the negotiations or 
returning to them. Hence Egypt is pursuing its political and 
diplomatic efforts to save the negotiations from the predicament 
in which the al-Ibrahimi Mosque crime has put them. We know 
that Egyptian efforts have gone hand in hand with the peace 
process from the beginning and have constantly been the 
lifesaver that rescued the hopes for peace and took them forward 
to a more advanced stage. [passage omitted]

  [Text] New Delhi says that Kashmir issue can be resolved if 
Islamabad has an open mind on bilateral dialogue. In an 
interview to AIR correspondent Sebastian Roberts in the 
Spotlight Program last night, the minister of state for external 
affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, said bilateral discussion is the 
only way to solve the problem, but Islamabad cannot expect that 
India should concede all its demands. He made it clear that New 
Delhi will do everything possible for the resumption of 
bilateral discussions. 
  Replying to a question, Mr. Salman Khurshid said the 
withdrawal of Pakistan's resolution in Geneva was unconditional 
and there is no question of its postponement to the next session 
of the UN Human Rights Commission. The minister said there is 
no confusion, as the chairman himself made this clear at the 
Geneva meeting.

  [Text] Tunis, 14 Mar (MENA)--PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator on the Middle East peace 
process, held a three-hour meeting in the presence of a number 
of Palestinian leaders. After the meeting, Ross said that the 
talks were useful and good and that he will meet with 'Arafat 
again this evening. Asked if the Palestinians will go to 
Washington to negotiate with the Israelis, Ross said that this 
issue has not yet been decided but consultations will be 
continued. 
  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Political Department, 
took 
part in the meeting and said that the talks with Ross were very 
useful and were characterized by frankness. He noted that the 
talks dealt with the details of the situation in the occupied 
territories and the need to provide security requirements for 
the Palestinian people so that political negotiations can be 
resumed. He said that the talks with Ross will resume this 
evening to continue discussion on the points that were not 
resolved during the meeting. 
  Members of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations declined 
to make any statements on the resolved issues or the points of 
disagreement. There are indications that during the meeting 
Ross failed to obtain 'Arafat's agreement to declare the PLO's 
return to the negotiating table with the Israelis and the 
resumption of the talks, which is the condition that the United 
States set on voting for the resolution submitted to the 
Security Council on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.

  [Text] Peace negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians remain at a standstill after talks in Tunis between 
an Israeli delegation and PLO leaders failed to break the 
impasse. PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat met twice with the Israeli 
team, headed by Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir. He 
also met for five hours with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross, but no 
progress was reported. More from Jack Katzenell: 
  [Begin recording] Yasir 'Arafat had meetings yesterday with 
the Israeli delegation, with the U.S. negotiator Dennis Ross, 
and with the Russian envoy and the Norwegian mediator. All of 
them tried to persuade the Palestinian leader to resume the 
negotiations with Israel, but they failed. 
  According to reports from Tunis and Washington, the 
differences between Ross and 'Arafat were mainly over the 
wording of the UN Security Council resolution condemning the 
Hebron massacre. 'Arafat was reported to have said he would not 
resume the negotiations without achievements for the 
Palestinians on the ground. 'Arafat's aide, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, 
told reporters the PLO is still looking for guarantees for the 
security of the Palestinians. A foreign correspondent in Tunis 
quoted one of the Israeli negotiators as saying: No concessions 
on settlements; no concessions on settlers. The Israeli 
negotiator was speaking immediately after having telephoned 
Prime Minister Rabin between meetings with 'Arafat. Israel did 
ban the Kakh and Kahana Hay organizations and took other steps 
against the hard core of the Jewish extremists, but it rejected 
the PLO's demands for the evacuation of some settlements and the 
disarming of all the settlers. 
  Rabin left for the United States last night accompanied by 
the cabinet secretary, Elyaqim Rubinstein; the director general 
of the Prime Minister's Office, Shim'on Sheves; and the chief of 
Military Intelligence, Major General Uri Sagi. Rabin had hoped 
to meet the delegation at the airport as it returned from Tunis, 
but he missed them; however, his adviser, Jacques Neriya, is 
flying directly from Tunis to Washington. 
  Before leaving, Rabin told a reporter he is not disappointed 
with the failure of the Tunis talks. He again described the 
Hebron massacre as the crossing of a red line, and he 
acknowledged that it would take some time for the Palestinians 
to return to the negotiating table. He hinted that Israel was 
willing to make concessions, but not if they contradicted the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  Next month, Yasir 'Arafat is going to Moscow at the 
invitation of President Yeltsin. The new activism of Russia in 
Middle East diplomacy is causing concern in Israel because it is 
no longer coordinated with the United States. In Jerusalem, 
there is a suspicion that the PLO is trying to play off Russia 
against the United States, as it did during the Cold War. 
'Arafat may have gotten the idea that he can get more out of 
the Russians than out of the Americans, and this could have 
contributed to the failure of yesterday's talks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques or Israel's </F>
Deputy?"] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful: 
The al-Khalil [Hebron] debacle, its repercussions and fallout, 
have turned into a revealing incident on the Palestinian scene. 
In a defensive reaction in the face of the fury and indignation 
of the Islamic world, the Zionist regime has announced that it 
is ready to pay reparations to the victims of the al-Khalil 
catastrophe. 
  However, the custodian of the two holy mosques has, in an 
unexpected move, accepted the responsibility of paying 
reparations on behalf of Israel and has even sanctioned the 
amount. 
  It is not clear what Saudi Arabia's role has been in the 
massacre of the fasting worshipers in the shrine of the Prophet 
Abraham -- peace be upon him -- that it has even surpassed 
Israel in payment of reparations and has even gone a step 
further and said that it is ready to do so on behalf of Israel. 
  Amid all this, one must not ignore the role of Washington. 
Right from the outset, Clinton and his associates tried their 
best to cover up the catastrophe and to call on the Arab side 
participating in the negotiations with Israel to be indifferent 
to it and to continue their talks, even in the current 
circumstances. 
  Even though 'Arafat stooped to immense degradation and 
lowliness and gave a positive response to this request from 
Washington, the other Arab countries suspended the peace process. 
  Thus, the question arises: What is the motive behind Saudi 
Arabia's nauseating attitude in intervening in the al-Khalil 
incident? Has this been the Saudi stance right from the outset? 
Is Riyadh under pressure from the United States and Israel to 
display such generosity? Do the Saudis consider themselves 
accomplices to Israel's crime that they are seeking to absolve 
themselves by proposing to pay reparations? 
  These and scores of other questions arise from this 
nauseating Saudi attitude and each indicates ambiguities in this 
major catastrophe. Thus, facts and figures indicate that the 
al-Khalil tragedy is far deeper than can be imagined and, in 
fact, is the "common weak spot" of the United States, Israel, 
and the al-Sa'uds. 
  Is this a new test for gauging how despicable the Arab 
reactionaries are? What were and are the objectives of 
Washington and the Zionists in continuing such actions? These 
are questions that, once answered, will yield other information 
and strong clues that will reveal that the objective was to 
degrade the Arabs and that this was not an accidental or 
unexpected incident. 
  Why is Saudi Arabia's concern greater than that of Israel 
and 
the United States? Why is it making pledges instead of Israel? 
The fact is that Israel is seeking to put the revolutionary 
front of Palestinian forces in a defensive position in every 
possible way. The al-Khalil massacre on Friday was an action 
with many motives that was carried out to intimidate the Muslims 
who do not leave the mosques empty even in the early hours of 
Ramadan. These actions by Israel were carried out with the 
al-Sa'uds paying the expenses. 
  Saudi Arabia's offer to pay reparations to the victims of 
Israeli atrocities will encourage the Zionists to embark on 
greater carnage of the oppressed Palestinians, and the stance of 
the custodian of the two holy mosques will make him appear to be 
the defender of Israel before the Muslims. This indicates that 
instead of taking the side of the Palestinians and the victims 
of the disaster, the custodian of the two holy mosques has taken 
the side of the criminals and the Zionist usurpers. 
  'Arafat has adopted the same stance and does not even have 
anything to say. He acquiesces to everything proposed by the 
United States and Israel with his eyes and ears closed. Prior 
to this incident, he did not have any respect in the eyes of the 
Palestinian nation and the revolutionary forces, but the 
al-Khalil catastrophe has dealt such an irrevocable blow to his 
prestige that it is unlikely that he will ever recover. 
  The contemptible reaction by 'Arafat on the al-Khalil 
tragedy 
proved that not only is he not the spokesman of the 
Palestinians, he is not even a Palestinian. This is because he 
has tried to declare the case of this crime closed and to ignore 
it. 
  The subtle point that needs to be noted with regard to this 
incident is that all the criminals and those who compromised 
have been disgraced and have lost all their credibility before 
the honorable Palestinian nation and the Islamic world. 
  Experience has once again proved that there is no solution 
but the annihilation of the usurpist Israel and the complete 
removal of this cancerous tumor from the center of the oil-rich 
region of the Islamic world. Those should be condemned even 
more than Israel who claim to be friends of the Palestinian 
nation but are, in fact, accomplices in Israel's atrocities. 
This is the issue that needs to be understood and that 
increases the responsibility of all of us.
