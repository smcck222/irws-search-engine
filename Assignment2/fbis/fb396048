  [Text] The chief of the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] 
Awami National Party Begum Nasim Wali Khan escaped an 
assassination attempt while on her way from Wali Bagh village to 
Peshawar today. A press note issued by the NWFP home department 
in Peshawar said between 0730 and 0800 Begum Nasim Wali Khan 
along with her driver was proceeding in a vehicle from her 
village toward Peshawar. About three kms from her village on 
(Takhtwai- Razia) Road, her vehicle was reportedly signalled to 
stop by some armed men, who started firing simultaneously. The 
driver of the vehicle received minor injuries while Begum Nasim 
Wali Khan remained unhurt. On hearing the shots, the police 
mobile party, which was on routine patrol in the vicinity, 
immediately rushed to the spot. The accused attempted to 
escape. However, they were pursued and the police party 
succeeded in apprehending two of them along with two Klashnikovs 
within a matter of minutes. During the encounter with the 
police party, one of the accused sustained injuries. He has 
been admitted to hospital, where his condition is reported to be 
serious. 
  A special team has been constituted to investigated the case 
on top priority basis. The provincial government has also 
decided to institute a high-level judicial inquiry into the 
incident to be headed by a judge of the high court, for which 
the chief justice of Peshawar High Court has already been 
requested.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, </F>
president of the United Arab Emirates, by unidentified 
correspondent in al-Jarf [as transliterated], between Abu Dhabi 
and Dubai, "yesterday"] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] The United Arab Emirates [UAE] is 
the only continuing and prosperous Arab unity. In your view, 
what are the reasons for its success, and how do you view the 
UAE's future? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE union will remain eternal, especially 
after the success of its experiment and the continued efforts to 
safeguard it. Nothing fragments and destroys a building except 
failure to look after it and failure to continue to give and 
build. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Your Highness Mr. President, do you believe that 
the time has come to end the serious Arab split caused by the 
Gulf crisis and achieve Arab reconciliation, and what do you 
believe is the means to achieve that, given that you have 
frequently called for Arab solidarity and supported the Arab 
League secretary general's initiative in this connection? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Arab nation's split and fragmentation 
existed before the Gulf war, but this war has aggravated and 
deepened this split. However, if there is now an inclination 
and a change of ideas for the sake of correcting the Arab march, 
eliminating disputes, and seriously and sincerely bolstering the 
unity of Arab ranks and linking the brothers' destiny, it will 
be a good thing. 
  As for the union some people believe should be established 
from the east to the west of the Arab world and which should 
have one leader, that is unacceptable, impossible, and never 
happened anywhere in the world before, neither in the East nor 
in the West. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you agree with the view that reconciliation is 
unlikely as long as President Saddam Husayn is still in power, 
as the wounds of the Gulf crisis in the Arab body still have not 
healed? Saddam is still in power, and the international embargo 
is inflicting a great deal of suffering on the Iraqis. How do 
you see a way out of this suffering? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Iraqi people's suffering is not caused by 
us; Saddam Husayn is responsible for it. We pray to God to show 
Saddam Husayn the right way one day. If the Arabs agree with 
one another, he might change his opinion and follow the right 
path that pleases him, the Iraqi people, and the Arab nation. 
Maybe that will be achieved. We should not give up hope. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] What stage has been reached in the problem of the 
UAE islands (Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa) 
occupied by Iran, and are you contemplating a new step that may 
restore the claimants' rights? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] We want something new. But when we hear 
Iran's statements, we find them remote from what we are 
contemplating. How can we negotiate with or get anything from 
someone who seizes a right and alleges it was his in the past? 
But if someone says this is mine and I have the evidence, 
others can provide their own evidence too. If their evidence is 
stronger, the right is theirs. If our evidence is stronger, the 
right is ours. If Iran's statements are made in such a manner, 
we would say: Yes, that is good and correct. But if we are 
told, we have our evidence and do not know whether our brothers 
and neighbors have any, the truth of this evidence can only be 
established through arbitration. 
  If we submit our evidence and they submit theirs to 
arbitration, it is arbitration which will decide which is 
correct and which is wrong. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean turning to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] Yes. 
  [AL-HAYAH] The U.S. Administration accuses Iran of 
supporting terrorism and stresses its concerns over Iran's 
endeavors to possess a huge military arsenal. Do you share these 
concerns with the Americans? What is your opinion of the "dual 
containment" pursued by President Bill Clinton's administration 
toward Iraq and Iran? How do you see the future of relations 
with Iran? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The United States knows the truth about Iran 
just as it knows the truth about Iraq. And Iran too knows the 
truth about the United States. Each knows the other. Every 
state wants equality, justice, and reconciliation with its 
neighbors and friends, and it has its own methods. But if a 
state wants to achieve something for itself and deny it to 
others, it is pursuing methods that moves it away from its 
neighbors, especially the states with which it has issues. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] How would you assess the peace process between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis, and what are the requirements 
for ending the Middle East problem? It has been reported that 
Abu-'Ammar will visit the UAE soon. Did he request a visit or 
did you invite him? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] We did not invite him. He wants to come, but 
we postponed his visit. We told him: You have something more 
important to do now. Your visit to us is not the important one. 
What is important is for you to correct yourself, your people, 
and homeland, then visiting us is open to you. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is there a specific date for the visit? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] No. 
  [AL-HAYAH] In view of the Gulf war experience, some Gulf 
states decided to sign security agreements with major states. 
Are you thinking of concluding a similar agreement, especially 
after the ruling out of the formation of a unified 
100,000-strong Gulf army? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] That depends on the situation and the need. 
If someone needs to build a home to protect him from rain, he 
begins to build it. If he needs an airconditioned house, he 
begins to build it. The UAE acts according to its needs, and 
nothing at all can stop us from doing what we believe achieves 
our security, existence on the ground, and respect. [passage 
omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Oil prices have slumped -- which affects the 
income of the producing states, including the UAE. At the 
recent meeting the UAE proposed a production ceiling. Is that 
still your position, given that you have always urged 
cooperation between producers and consumers so that everyone can 
get his rights? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The UAE is one of several fraternal states, 
and it will support what makes its sisters happy. It will not 
move in front of them or stay behind them. This is the UAE's 
position. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you mean that the UAE is coordinating with the 
fraternal states? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] Yes. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-HAYAH] Is there a possibility of a cabinet reshuffle 
soon? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] Yes. 
  [AL-HAYAH] You criticized the position of both East and 
West. Do you believe the Arabs and Muslims have in one way or 
another disappointed the Bosnian Muslims, and what are the means 
of building new Arab and Islamic support for these people? 
  [Al Nuhayyan] The Arabs cannot be blamed in any way. The 
blame should be pinned on the major states talking about justice 
and human rights. You heard a great deal about these states' 
talk about human rights. They are interested in the human 
rights of people who are far from them, not those of the people 
in their region. They talk about human rights, and yet the 
Bosnians are being murdered, expelled, and deprived of their 
territory and children. Human rights have not helped them at 
all. 
  There is a lot of talk and little action. Anyone who talks a 
lot does little. It is the major states' responsibility, not 
the Arab states' responsibility. Because the Arab states are 
still in the process of building themselves and have not 
achieved anything, and so are the Islamic states. May God 
enable us to achieve what we want for our Arab and Islamic 
nation. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you believe that the Gulf states can surmount 
the complications of the occupation and liberation of Kuwait, 
hence enabling the Arab states to return to unified action? 
  [Al-Nuhayyan] If all the Arab states have the desire and 
seriousness, the Arab nation -- Kuwait and others -- will be 
fine. If we remember what we have lost in the past, avoid the 
methods that harmed us in the past, and think about the methods 
that benefit, strengthen, and unite us as an Arab nation, the 
Arab nation will restore its glory. Our unity is our strength 
and the Arab nation's eternal asset. If we believe in that, 
every good will be achieved.

<F P=106> [Report by Bisharah Shirbil: "Libyan Salvation Front </F>
Dissidents Announce New Organization"] 
  [Text] London -- Those who have split from the National 
Front for the Salvation of Libya announced yesterday a new 
organization called the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform 
[al-harakah al-libiyah littaghyyir al-islah]. Abrik al-Suwaysi 
was chosen as official spokesman for the organization's 
constituent committee. 
  The committee included in its founding statement its overall 
intellectual and political view of the situation in Libya and 
possibilities for change. It stressed that it will continue its 
contacts to convene the constituent conference to form 
organizational institutions. It also pointed out that its 
mission ends with the convening of the constituent assembly and 
that its framework is open to all Libyans who agree with the 
principles it announced. 
  Al-Suwaysi told AL-HAYAH that "the announcement of the 
statement from Geneva has no political significance. We had 
hoped to announce the organization from a neighboring state, but 
current circumstances did not permit." He expressed his hope 
that the constituent conference will be held within four or five 
months. "The constituent committee is preparing for it and has 
not set a particular date for it, because we are still at the 
beginning." 
  He said that "the Libyan National Army, which is led by 
Staff 
Colonel Khalifah Haftar, is an integral part of the 
organization, as it consists of our comrades who decided to 
separate from the Salvation Front for the same reasons that 
prompted us to break away. Col. Haftar is a founding member of 
the political organization and has both the political and 
military capacity. However, the Army will not be confined to 
those who join the organization, but will be open to all Libyans 
wishing to make sacrifices. We do not make it a condition that 
membership of the organization be confined to those who want to 
participate in its military program."

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA) -- President Husni Mubarak has 
said that all his efforts on the Arab and international scenes 
aim to promote Egyptian interests. Unless the world senses that 
Egypt is prepared to assume a key role in the region no one will 
assist us. The result would be negative both in terms of the 
Egyptian domestic scene and the life of ordinary Egyptians. 
Many nations have fallen behind, retreating into backwardness 
and poverty that Egypt is not eager to join, he stated. 
  Speaking to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers during the 
plane trip from Harare to Cairo, Mubarak said that the daunting 
efforts in which he is engaged, his exchanges with various world 
leaders, and his bid to achieve stability in the region have 
demonstrated to the entire world, particularly the big powers, 
the vitality of Egypt's role in this part of the world. Egypt's 
policy during the Gulf war proved to the whole world that Egypt 
is a reliable force, he said. 
  President Mubarak said that the consultations he held with 
leaders of major countries and his friendship with them led 
these countries to adopt policies that helped Egypt in its talks 
with the IMF. 
  The world does not appreciate reclusive nations and that 
major powers only support those countries that have stature and 
influence and get involved in world events, Mubarak pointed out. 
  President Mubarak said that he is in constant touch with 
U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, and Jordan's King Husayn in an 
effort to stimulate the peace process and resume the 
Arab-Israeli talks in Washington. He pointed out that even 
during his stay in Harare he talked on the telephone with King 
Husayn. 
  President Mubarak added that the contacts he had with 
President Clinton and all the other parties produced results, 
particularly following the UN Security Council resolution 
concerning the massacre in al-Ibrahimi Mosque. An Israeli 
delegation will meet in Tunisia with Palestinian officials to 
review current proposals and prepare for high-level 
Palestinian-Israeli talks, he remarked. 
  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are likely 
to meet in Cairo to sign an agreement detailing the practical 
measures for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles, Mubarak said. The agreement will set 
a timetable for the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return 
of 'Arafat to Palestinian land. The president pointed out that 
an Israeli- Palestinian agreement was already reached before the 
Hebron massacre occurred. 
  Jerusalem's status will be determined through negotiations, 
Mubarak said. A statement in which U.S. President Clinton 
declared otherwise [a'lana ghayr dhalik] has been cited by a 
U.S. television network, but this statement was denied by an 
adviser at the U.S. Department of State who was speaking to 
journalists in Cairo last Thursday, Mubarak remarked. President 
Mubarak reemphasized the position of the U.S. Administration 
vis-a-vis Jerusalem, whose status will be determined through 
negotiations [al-quds allati sayatahaddadu mawqifaha min khilal 
al-mufawadat]. 
  Concerning the possibility that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher might visit the region in the near future, 
President Mubarak said: Such a visit is likely. 
  To a question about the attitude of some Arab rulers toward 
Egypt, President Mubarak said: I don't care about persons, but 
I do care about the Arab nations. My principal concern is the 
interest of these nations. We are against the partitioning of 
Iraq and Sudan. 
  To another question about the recent visit to Cairo by 
Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, and the possibilities of arranging a meeting between 
them in Cairo soon to achieve national reconciliation, President 
Mubarak said that Egypt is making the necessary contacts in this 
regard to achieve progress. However, the arrangements for such 
a meeting in Cairo must be preceded by an agreement between the 
two sides, President Mubarak added. 
  Alluding to the issue of national dialogue in Egypt, 
President Mubarak said that he will call for the start of this 
dialogue next April and that he will deliver a speech when the 
dialogue starts. He pointed out that working groups and a 
committee representing all concerned groups will be formed. He 
affirmed that the government is currently carrying out tangible 
and concrete efforts, adding that Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi's tours of various governorates have helped to solve many 
problems. President Mubarak said that some 200 projects were 
recently set up in Suhaj Governorate, noting that this will help 
solve the problem of unemployment. 
  Continuing, President Mubarak said that the government will 
make strenuous efforts in the various fields by the end of this 
year and the beginning of next year. 
  Commenting on current intensive activity by the political 
parties to prepare for next year's People's Assembly and 
Consultative Council elections, President Mubarak said that 
everybody is encouraged to join such activity and he is sure 
that the makeup of future parliaments will reflect this popular 
participation. 
  He asserted that the government is doing its best to solve 
all problems, particularly important ones like unemployment. He 
urged further efforts to solve this problem gradually. 
  President Mubarak said that in the past Egypt had no 
currency 
reserves in the banks and that current reserves must not be 
squandered but kept for appropriate uses, noting that the money 
belongs both to the public and the banks. 
  Discussing the reduced revenue from tourism and the demands 
made by some people working in the tourist business, he said 
that the government has exempted owners of tourist businesses in 
Aswan from taxes for 10 years. He noted, however, that some 
unreasonable requests are being made. He said many citizens 
have suffered as a result of lower tourism profits. 
  Mubarak said although some people are disturbed by the 
evident wealth of some Egyptians, one must remember that wealthy 
people who invest their money in projects or spend it at hotels 
and other places are actually helping to create jobs for others. 
He explained that this issue must be viewed from a practical 
angle, taking into account the benefit to society and Egyptian 
families. 
  On the South African Committee meeting that President 
Mubarak chaired in Harare yesterday, the president said that the 
committee had met to discuss measures by which the OAU could 
contribute to backing the democratic process in South Africa. 
President Mubarak noted that the KwaZulu announced their 
independence yesterday and that they want to set up a state 
independent of South Africa, but the South African Committee in 
its meeting yesterday rejected the question of KwaZulu's 
independence. He noted that the final statement issued by the 
committee had reaffirmed the territorial integrity of South 
Africa. President Mubarak added: We will hold urgent and 
extensive talks with all parties, the major states, and the 
United States to assist the democratic process in South Africa 
and facilitate the elections that will be held on 27 April. 
  President Mubarak noted that the white right-wing party 
[al-hizb al-abyad al-yamini] in South Africa is pressing the 
KwaZulu to create these problems, adding that urgent messages 
will be sent in the next two days to resolve these problems. 
President Mubarak described the results of the South African 
Committee meetings as good. He noted that there was a proposal 
to hold an international conference on the elections in South 
Africa, but the proposal was not accepted. Besides, he added, 
the people of South Africa must approve of such a conference 
first. He pointed out that the elections will be held on 27 
April and the South Africans do not want to postpone them, 
because such a postponement would be a disaster for them and 
would lead to serious consequences. 
  Asked if he would go to South Africa on 10 May following the 
elections in his capacity as OAU chairman, the president said 
that nothing has been decided yet, adding that this could be 
determined after the elections. The president expressed concern 
over the current events in South Africa, where some people are 
sneaking their money out of the country. He noted that this 
will have a very negative effect on development in South Africa 
after the elections. He hoped that there would be stability in 
South Africa in the coming stage and that the national forces 
would avoid potential conflicts. 
  On the status of the KwaZulu in South Africa, President 
Mubarak said that the KwaZulu have no resources, oil, or 
minerals, but they are closely linked to the apartheid regime.

  [Text] Tehran, March 20, IRNA -- Leader of the Islamic 
revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i, in his New Year 
message tonight said the Iranian nation is not only thinking of 
its own salvation but "our historical movement is creating a new 
civilization". 
  He said: "We are building a civilization, whose main 
foundations are culture, insight, wisdom and the perfection of 
human thought." 
  The leader's message at 23:58 hours local time, ushered in 
the new calendar year, 1373 [21 March] of the solar Hijra, which 
is in official use in Iran and Afghanistan instead of the 
Gregorian Christian calendar (1994). 
  Monday the 1st of Farvardin is the vernal or spring equinox, 
a day celebrated as 'Nowroze' or New Year Day in Iran and 
several other countries. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i laid stress on ethical values and 
commitment to work in view of the fact that Iran enjoys a new 
system, lofty ideals and important objectives "which appeal to 
every just person. 
  "The Iranian people with their bright culture rooted in 
history together with abundant material wealth, should under the 
circumstances, bring about ethical promotion", he added. 
  Terming ethics and self-reform as "one of the secrets of the 
human move towards perfection", the leader said: "Whoever we 
are, and whatever our degree of knowledge, wisdom and 
perfection, we must supplicate to God to help us move towards 
further perfection". 
  He also urged the nation to respect social regulations at 
all 
levels, and referring to commitment to work and discipline as 
"two important and essential factors in individual and social 
life", said the efforts of a nation dedicated to work always 
yield good results and guarantee the welfare of society. 
  Ayatollah Khamene'i praised the families of the martyrs of 
the revolution and the imposed war, as well as the disabled, the 
former POWs and war veterans. 
  He also saluted the soul of the father of the Islamic 
revolution, Imam Khomeyni. 
  In the use of the resources of the country mines and 
industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran 
is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major 
elements for the industrialized world, he added. 
  Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during 
this period has almost quadrupled, and "if this movement 
continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large 
extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are 
mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence 
on the scene." 
  He said that for youth this year and in the future years 
there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of 
population our country is a young country, and our young forces 
require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the 
course of the revolution well." 
  The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by 
Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said 
"grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this 
policy will continue to be exercised so that this year from the 
point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and 
especially women we will have a successful year." 
  He was all praise for the Armed Forces and the unknown 
soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilance and 
sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era 
of holy defense (1980-88). 
  The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy 
industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants 
such as steel and petrochemicals. 
  "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of 
them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to 
some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectable 
traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We, 
too, will support them. 
  "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God 
willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities, 
especially for the people active in exports." 
  He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing 
people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled 
and the former POWs and their proud families and with the 
efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran 
is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to 
embark on the tasks ahead. 
  He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year 
foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of 
the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year 
we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a 
chance to have more power on the market." 
  Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache. 
  "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan, 
Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places 
Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world 
arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam." 
  He said Iran was trying its best to help Muslims and will 
continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems. 
  "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I 
think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and 
with cooperation," he was confident [sentence as received].

  [Text] Tunis, 19 Mar (MENA)--The PLO has welcomed the UN 
Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre in Jerusalem [as received]. 
  An official Palestinian source has affirmed that the 
Security 
Council resolution constitutes a basis for immediate enforcement 
of the measures necessary to protect the Palestinian people in 
the occupied territories in order to guarantee the successful 
resumption of peace negotiations with Israel. 
  Following a meeting under Yasir 'Arafat's chairmanship 
today, 
the PLO called on the international community, particularly the 
sponsors of the peace process, to act immediately to implement 
the Council resolution, because guaranteeing the safety of the 
Palestinian people and international protection for them is an 
essential necessity. The PLO underlined the need to eliminate 
the terrorist pockets in the settlements and to discuss the 
status of armed settlers. 
  The official source noted that the PLO welcomed the issuing 
of the Security Council resolution despite all the difficulties 
and obstacles that were raised to obstruct or avert it. The PLO 
also welcomed the international community's condemnation and its 
endorsement of specific measures to guarantee protection for the 
Palestinian people on their occupied territories, including the 
disarming of settlers and the provision of an international 
presence to protect the Palestinian people. 
  The PLO pointed out that this consensus denotes a public 
awareness of the ugliness of the massacre, its dimensions and 
causes, as well as eagerness to guarantee the safety and 
protection of the Palestinian people. 
  The organization regretted the U.S. abstention on two 
paragraphs on Jerusalem and the occupied territories. It 
affirmed that this attitude affects the U.S. reputation, 
particularly since the issue is related to Jerusalem--a very 
vital issue at the Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, Christian, and 
international levels--and casts doubts on the permanence of 
official U.S. stands on some basic aspects in the regional 
conflict.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in Tunis, by MBC </F>
correspondent Nicole Tannuri, in London, on 19 March--recorded] 
  [Text] [Tannuri] While Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan have 
agreed to resume the negotiations, the PLO stand continues to be 
undecided. A few minutes ago, we spoke to Palestinian President 
'Arafat in Tunis and asked him about his evaluation of the 
Security Council resolution. 
  ['Arafat] Despite the fact that we do not have any queries 
regarding the clarifications given by the U.S. envoy [to the 
United Nations] especially with respect to the issue of 
Jerusalem. [incomplete sentence as heard] 
  [Tannuri] Mr. President, there are positive indications from 
the PLO regarding the resumption of talks. What, in your 
opinion, is the ideal scenario for returning to the negotiation 
table? 
  ['Arafat] As I said now, what has been agreed on in the 
Security Council must be implemented very quickly. Israel must 
take important and basic steps regarding the settlers, 
especially in the Hebron area. They are the ones who claim that 
there are two organizations that have become virtual outlaws. 
These are Kakh and Kahana Hay. These two organizations have 
supporters among the settlers. They have time bombs in their 
possession. In addition, they have settlements; around five or 
six settlements belong to them. What will the Israeli 
Government's measures be regarding these settlements belonging 
to these two groups? 
  [Tannuri] The other concerned Arab countries have decided to 
return to negotiations. Does this raise questions once again 
regarding Arab coordination? 
  ['Arafat] Yesterday, King Husayn phoned me twice, after he 
had telephoned my brother President Hafiz al-Asad. He told me 
that they had received telephone calls from U.S. President 
Clinton to return to the peace negotiations. We agreed to 
convene a meeting of the five foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, 
Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine as soon as possible to coordinate 
stands over this matter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik "in Jerusalem, a short while ago"-- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Rabin] I expect the resumption of the 
negotiations with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon as soon as April, 
after the Passover and Independence Day holidays. I very much 
hope that this time, they will be held on a much more 
businesslike basis than in the past. 
  [Sukenik] Last night you spoke to 'Arafat on the phone. 
Other than discussing the UN Security Council resolution, did 
you make any promises to him that made him push to move forward? 
  [Rabin] I made no specific offers, except for stressing that 
the Palestinians as well as ourselves should in no way grant 
awards to loathsome murderers on both sides. They should not 
give any prizes to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or the 
Islamic Jihad, and we will not give any awards to the supporters 
of the loathsome murderer who committed the abhorrent crime in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  [Sukenik] Is the issue of evacuating settlers from Hebron 
still off the agenda? 
  [Rabin] I made no commitment, except for the pledge to stand 
by our responsibility -- in addition to the struggle against the 
Palestinian extremist terrorism which seeks to murder Israelis 
and the peace -- to provide the Palestinians with protection 
against loathsome murderers the likes of that man, who does not 
deserve to be called a human being, who committed the murder in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs.

<F P=106> [Randah Habib report from Amman] </F>
  [Text] The Jordanian monarch King Husayn believes that it 
was a mistake to force the Jerusalem issue into a draft UN 
Security Council [UNSC] resolution on the Hebron massacre, 
something which prompted the United States to abstain when the 
paragraph pertaining to Jerusalem was put to the vote. He said 
that this was caused by the lack of inter-Arab coordination. He 
also asked Washington to explain its vote at the UNSC. 
  In an exclusive interview with King Husayn, the Hashemite 
monarch criticized the way the draft resolution was handled. He 
indicated that it was possible to avoid any mention of 
Jerusalem, and to only invoke the Geneva Convention to address 
the issue of protecting the Palestinians in the territories 
occupied since 1967. 
  The Jordanian monarch added: Had this scenario been pursued, 
we might have come up with an outcome that is better than the 
current one, which is marked by Washington's abstention. This 
is because this abstention might be interpreted as a change in 
its position toward Arab claims to Jerusalem. 
  Having expressed his worries about the fragmented, 
uncomfortable, and unsatisfactory Arab state of affairs, the 
Hashemite monarch wondered: Was it necessary to force the 
Jerusalem issue into this draft resolution, given the fact that 
there were chances for a U.S. veto or abstention? 
  The Hashemite monarch added: We must receive assurances that 
the U.S. policy toward Jerusalem has remained unchanged. The 
U.S. policy on settlements changed because it first deemed them 
illegal. Later, it deemed them an obstacle to peace. 
  King Husayn went on to say: The only explanation I have for 
this situation is that it is the outcome of the lack of 
coordination in critical, sensitive, and difficult 
circumstances. He noted that the calls for coordination only 
surface to ensure a sort of cover for some when they need it.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League General 
Secretariat has urged the UN Security Council to implement 
expeditiously its resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  In a statement issued today, the General Secretariat cited 
Security Council Resolution 904, which condemns the massacre, 
urges measures to guarantee the safety of Palestinian civilians 
in the occupied territories, calls for international or foreign 
presence in those areas and the confiscation of the Israeli 
settlers' weapons, and urges further efforts by the peace 
conference co-sponsors to revive the peace process. 
  The statement pointed out that the contents of the 
resolution 
are guidelines that must be built upon to attain a comprehensive 
and just peace in the Middle East, particularly as its clauses 
are similar to some parts of the Arab League Council's 
resolution of 27 February on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The Arab League General Secretariat appealed to the Security 
Council to implement its resolution with due speed, demanding 
that the resolution not be subjected to Israeli procrastination 
and evasion designed to dilute it. 
  The statement noted that expeditious implementation of the 
resolution, being in line with existing international 
agreements, will protect the unarmed Palestinian people from 
Israeli practices. 
  The Secretariat reiterated its firm position on the Arabness 
of Jerusalem and the need to abide by UN Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stated that the sudden developments 
in the Arab-Israeli conflict, particularly after the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, require more work than ever to achieve Arab 
reconciliation and unify the Arab fold to unite the Arab 
political will to enable the Arabs to deal with all the 
challenges and dangers, primarily Israel's continuing occupation 
of the Arab territories, including holy Jerusalem. 
  In a statement today marking the Arab League's 49th 
anniversary, which the League will celebrate tomorrow, Tuesday, 
'Abd-al-Majid said the challenges require our nation to rise 
above its wounds and pain and restore Arab solidarity on firm 
foundations based on frankness and openness with the eagerness 
to stick to the goals and principles of the Arab League Charter. 
  He asked the Security Council and the two countries 
sponsoring the peace conference to quickly implement Security 
Council Resolution 904 denouncing the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre. He also called for providing the necessary 
international protection for the Palestinian people in the 
occupied territories, applying the Fourth Geneva Conventions to 
them, disarming the Jewish settlers, and removing the Israeli 
settlements, which form a new impediment to the peace talks. 
  He appealed to the Security Council not to use two 
yardsticks 
and to quickly implement the UN Charter's provisions so that 
peace, development, and fruitful cooperation in the Middle East 
will materialize. He reiterated the Arab identity of Jerusalem 
and the commitment to implement international legitimacy 
Resolutions 242, 252, 338, 425, and 465 on the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
  He said last year's events have shown that seeking the 
arbitration of the UN and Arab League Charters is the ideal way 
to resolve numerous conflicts that face our Arab nation. He 
also stressed his confidence that the restoration of Arab 
solidarity and joint action forms a firm basis to enhance Arab 
capability to face up to the current challenges and ambitions. 
  'Abd-al-Majid called for unifying the will of Arabs toward 
enhancing and strengthening the Arab League structure by setting 
up an Arab court of justice as an effective tool to peacefully 
resolve conflicts involving Arab countries. He noted that had 
such a court existed before 2 August 1990, the Arab nation would 
have avoided the serious ramifications of the Gulf crisis the 
effects of which we are still suffering. 
  He said he hoped the Arab League Council could, at its next 
session on Saturday, achieve this mechanism--an Arab court of 
justice--so that the Arab nation might handle the dangers and 
challenges it is facing and that affect the structure of 
pan-Arab security. 
  The Arab League secretary general said: The anniversary of 
the Arab League, which was founded in 1945, the oldest regional 
organization set up after World War II, represents an important 
stage in Arab history. This requires us to consider being frank 
and open so that we may learn a lesson that will help us to 
sense the steps to take at a time when the Arab nation faces 
developments of a strategic nature in the international arena, 
primarily reorganizing economics on new bases.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Mar (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador to 
Egypt Sa'id Kamal has announced that the foreign ministers of 
the cordon states, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the PLO, might 
hold a meeting on the sidelines of the Arab League session in 
Cairo next Saturday [26 March]. 
  Kamal told MENA that the aim of the meeting is to coordinate 
positions and give the five concerned Arab parties an 
opportunity to consult over future actions. This will be 
especially useful after the issue of resuming the peace talks is 
settled in light of the UN Security Council resolution adopted 
today. The resolution condemns the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
and backs the protection of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  Kamal said next Saturday's meeting will also discuss the 
serious negative repercussions of the massacre on the peace 
process and likely criminal plans that Israeli settlers might be 
drawing up in response to the Security Council resolution.

  [Text] The Israeli delegation will meet with PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis today for the second time. Our Arab 
affairs correspondent Arye Gus has learned that last night's 
meeting between the sides, which was marked by a positive 
atmosphere, dealt with security arrangements in the wake of the 
UN Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre, as well 
as with the resumption of the negotiations between Israel and 
the PLO. The sides did not deal with the demand to remove the 
settlers from Hebron. It is also possible that the Israeli 
delegation will meet with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross in Tunis. 
The delegation is scheduled to return to Israel tonight.

<F P=106> [Report by Nasir 'Arif] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian sources have disclosed to AL-ASWAQ that 
Israeli-Palestinian contacts in Tunis over the past few days 
focused on drafting a special agreement that will be called the 
Palestinian security and protection agreement. The same sources 
indicated that the agreement will include the following: 
  -- Evacuating settlers from the city of Hebron. 
  -- Concentrating all Gaza Strip settlements in one place. 
  -- Drawing up a mechanism by which the settlers' weaponry 
will be restricted. The maximum limit of this mechanism would 
be withdrawing weapons from settlers for good while the minimum 
would be preventing them from carrying arms when moving around. 
  -- Deploying UN observers in Gaza and Jericho and some 
other areas in the West Bank cities in implementation of 
Security Council Resolution No. 904. 
  The sources, which declined to be named, told AL-ASWAQ that 
the Palestinians want this agreement to be one of the annexes of 
the Oslo agreement. Israel, however, rejects this and is 
reserved on the principle of drafting a special agreement on 
security measures for the Palestinian people. It prefers that 
such measures be taken on its own initiative so that they not be 
depicted as Israel complying with Palestinian conditions. 
  The sources expected all these matters to be discussed 
during 
a meeting between Israeli chief delegate Amnon Shahaq and the 
Palestinian leadership in Tunis. Meetings are also expected to 
continue, including the U.S. mediation effort through Dennis 
Ross, the U.S. peace coordinator, in order to work out these 
security issues and reach a formula acceptable to the two sides. 
  In a related development, a responsible Palestinian source 
said the PLO will not resume official talks with the Israeli 
side in Washington next month as agreed by the Arab states 
unless Israel adopts security measures to protect the 
Palestinians. 
  Arab sources told AL-ASWAQ that differences remain over the 
venue of the coordination meeting of the Cordon [al-tawq] 
States, the parties invited to it, and the nature of the 
decision that will be taken continue to prevent the convocation 
of such a meeting. Syria wants a tripartite meeting in Damascus 
by delegations from Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, excluding Egypt 
and the PLO, because it believes the PLO departed from Arab 
coordination when it signed the Oslo Agreement. The Egyptian 
side wants a collective coordination meeting in Cairo for all 
states concerned in negotiations, including the PLO. 
  Commenting on these reports, Palestinian sources said the 
PLO 
does not care whether the coordination meeting is held in 
Damascus or Cairo, but believes the meeting should be 
consecrated to unifying Arab efforts to pressure Israel into 
adopting practical measures to protect the Palestinian citizens 
in the occupied territories. The sources added that the PLO 
believes the purpose of the meeting should not be coordinating 
stands on issues that will be negotiated with the Israeli side 
during the next round of talks because the PLO still has 
reservations on the resumption of talks before Israel starts to 
practically implement Security Council Resolution 904.

  [Text] Two senior Foreign Ministry officials left for 
Paris before dawn today for a secret meeting, apparently with a 
senior economic figure from an Arab country with which Israel 
does not have diplomatic relations. Our political correspondent 
Gadi Sukenik has learned that the two are 'Oded 'Eran, assistant 
director general in charge of economics, and Rafi Baraq, the 
head of the Foreign Ministry director general's bureau. They 
will return home in less than 24 hours. The Foreign Ministry 
refused to confirm or deny the report.

  [Text] Dennis Ross, U.S coordinator for Middle East 
Affairs, arrived in Tunis this afternoon and immediately met 
with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. It has been learned 
from the PLO headquarters that these talks are focussing on the 
formal resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations after 
the UN Security Council condemned, in its Resolution No. 904, 
the massacre at the Tomb of Patriarchs [in Hebron]. 
  The Palestinian president had earlier met, for the second 
time since yesterday, an Israeli delegation that is carrying 
proposals on security measures to be taken by Israel to ensure 
the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
The Israelis have said that they would implement these measures 
only after a date for the resumption of talks on autonomy in 
Gaza and Jericho is announced. 
  In an interview with the U.S. newspaper NEW YORK TIMES, 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat had said that it was very 
difficult to resume talks with Israel under the pressure of 
aggressive practices [as heard] and that talks held under such 
conditions would not last very long.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] President Yasir 'Arafat and U.S. peace coordinator 
Dennis Ross will resume talks this evening. Following the first 
round of talks this afternoon between'Arafat and Ross, which 
lasted for one and a half hours, Dennis Ross said the meeting 
was useful. However, he did not elaborate. 
  We learned that the meeting focused on listening to the 
Palestinian viewpoint following the issuance of the Security 
Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre. The 
Palestinian side said that what is required from Washington now 
-- in its capacity as one of the cosponsors -- is to intervene 
effectively to implement the provisions of Resolution 904, 
particularly regarding international protection for the 
Palestinian people under occupation. It cannot just be 
satisfied with listening to the Palestinian and Israeli 
viewpoints but must try to bring them closer. 
  The Palestinian side underscored the need for an 
international security force in the occupied territory, not just 
observers. The Palestinian side also reiterated the need for 
reaching a clear solution to the issue of settlers in Hebron and 
for disarming them. 
  Dennis Ross is expected to meet with the Israeli delegation 
led by Amnon Shahaq before resuming his talks with the 
Palestinian leadership this evening.

occupied territories, the form of the international presence 
approved by the Security Council in these territories, and the

  [Text] Tunis, March 21 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO appeared 
headed Monday [21 March] for a compromise on boosting security 
for Palestinians in the occupied territories following the 
Hebron massacre, diplomats said. 
  The compromise proposed by Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Terje Larsen would allow between 300 and 500 lightly armed 
observers to be deployed in the West Bank town of Hebron, they 
added. 
  Between 600 and 1,000 other observers would be deployed in 
the Gaza Strip, while between 1,100 and 1,200 men would be 
dispatched to Jericho. 
  PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat agrees to the plan so long as it is 
implemented quickly, the diplomats said. 
  The observers, totalling between 2,000 to 2,700 men, would 
conduct joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols under Israeli command. 
  The diplomats said Arafat would likely go to Paris Thursday 
for talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and for 
discussions with European donors to the financial aid plan for 
the future self-rule authorities. 
  The PLO suspended talks to launch autonomy in Gaza and 
Jericho after a Jewish settler shot dead 30 Arab worshippers at 
the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron last month. 
  The PLO has vowed not to resume the talks until it receives 
adequate security guarantees from Israel.

  [Excerpt] AL-MUHARRIR has learned that in the next few days 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will undertake a shuttle trip 
to the Gulf to remove the causes of tension between Qatar and 
Bahrain. The tour will take place in light of the military 
concentrations which threatens a confrontation between the two 
countries over the Islands of Hawar and Fasht al-Dibal. The two 
states have moved artillery and missile batteries toward the 
disputed areas. Mubarak's urgent contacts with the two states 
helped ease the tension and have postponed any clashes. 
  The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has received an urgent report 
on the developments of the crisis, as well as documents the two 
sides presented to the International Court of Justice, which has 
been examining the dispute since November 1992. The report says 
that the recent escalation resulted from the struggle among 
foreign companies prospecting for oil in the disputed areas.

  [Text] Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid has said that the establishment of a Middle East 
market should not scare the Arab states because it is contingent 
on Arab approval. He said that reaching a settlement of the 
Middle East crisis does not mean giving Israel economic 
advantages. 
  In a study on this issue, the Arab League said that reaching 
a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East implies 
ordinary commercial relations with Israel but does not 
necessarily mean linking the Arab states with Israel by a free 
trade zone. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the ability of the Arab states 
to 
deal with the Middle East market basically depends on ensuring 
their unity and preserving their identity. He described Israel 
as a small area in the world with limited resources amid a large 
Arab world with big resources. He noted that the establishment 
of a Middle East market should not scare the Arab states because 
it is basically contingent on Arab approval. Reaching a 
settlement of the Middle East crisis does not mean granting 
Israel economic advantages. 
  'Abd-al-Majid stressed the need for the Arab states to 
coordinate their stands on this market and to prepare a unified 
strategy that adopts the [word indistinct] Arab interests. He 
noted that the Middle East Market may include other countries in 
the region, such as Cyprus, Turkey, and Iran. 
  A study of the Middle East market prepared by the economic 
department in the Arab League emphasized the need to look for 
new methods to back the Arab economy by developing an agreement 
on facilitating and developing trade exchanges and establishing 
an Arab free trade zone. The study attributes the weakness of 
the Arab economy to the weakness of its production bases, the 
low technological level, and the competition among Arab 
economies in producing similar products, in addition to the low 
level of Arab investments in Arab countries. 
  The Arab League sent this study to Arab finance and economy 
ministers late last month in preparation for presenting it to 
the next session of the Arab League's foreign ministers' council 
in late March. The study defined the factors of [Israel's] 
economic strength due to its high level of technological 
development in the field of manufacturing industries and in the 
agricultural sector, the private sector's responsibility for 
running the Israeli economy, adopting export-oriented policy, 
the increase in the accumulation of capital, and the high 
production level of the Israeli worker. 
  The study sheds light on the weak points of the Israeli 
economy, especially its dependence on external assistance, lack 
of raw materials, and the reduction of the future development 
growth. 
  [Words indistinct] UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali the 
developments of conditions in the occupied territory following 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the situation in Bosnia and the 
Gulf, and the UN stand, and Israel's refusal to be committed to 
any international resolution on occupied territory during their 
attendance of the international law symposium to be held in 
Qatar 21-23 March. 
  A responsible Arab League source said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
will discuss with Butrus-Ghali the developments in the 
Arab-Israeli peace talks and the Israeli obstacles, beginning 
with Israel's noncompliance with the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles and ending with the Hebron massacre. 
The source added that the repeated attacks on southern Lebanon 
and the displacement of thousands of Lebanese families will also 
be discussed. The source said that [words indistinct] issues 
discussed on the Arab League council on 26 March.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 15 March 
issue of Cairo 'AQIDATI summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS </H5>
  1. Merciful Nature of Islam 
  2. Foreign Invasions Linked to Muslims' Weakness and 
Division 
  3. No Separation of the Sexes in Islam 
  4. Freedom of Opinion in Islam 
  5. Islam in Singapore 
  6. Muslims in Cambodia 
  7. Veiled Students in France Prevented From Entering 
Schools 
  8. Banning of Satellite Dishes in Saudi Arabia 
<H5>  MERCIFUL NATURE OF ISLAM </H5>
  On page seven, the newspaper carries a 1,000-word article by 
Grand Shaykh of al-Azhar Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq entitled 
"Islam is a Religion of Mercy." Jad-al-Haq confines himself to 
religious issues to stress the merciful nature of Islam. He 
cites several sayings by the Prophet Muhammad on this topic. 
<H5>  FOREIGN INVASIONS LINKED TO MUSLIMS' WEAKNESS AND DIVISION </H5>
  Also on page seven, the newspaper features a 900-word 
article 
by Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah. He maintains there is 
an "organic link" between foreign threats and invasions and the 
Muslims' weakness and backwardness. He says all foreign 
invasions of Muslim lands took place when the Muslims were weak 
and divided. To substantiate his views, he cites the Crusades 
1096-1291, the Tatar invasion of Baghdad in 1258, and the French 
campaign in Egypt under Napoleon Bonaparte between 1769 and 1805. 
<H5>  NO SEPARATION OF THE SEXES IN ISLAM </H5>
  On pages eight and nine, Shaykh Ahmad Abu-al-'Ala' answers 
readers' questions on several religious issues. In answer to a 
question by a female student on Islam's ruling regarding 
coeducational schools and colleges, he says that "Islam does not 
call for the complete separation of the two sexes" but has asked 
the people to be modest in their dressing so as not to encourage 
adultery. He adds that Islam allows men and women to meet in 
mosques. Therefore, if this is allowed in places of worship, it 
is also allowed in colleges and schools provided that it does 
not lead to fornication. 
<H5>  FREEDOM OF OPINION IN ISLAM </H5>
  On page nine, the newspaper carries an 800-word article by 
Hamid Isma'il entitled "Freedom of Opinion in Islam." He says 
"Islam has guaranteed freedom of thought and expression." 
However, he notes that Islam has recommended that this freedom 
be exercised in its "correct framework," which "builds and does 
not destroy," "does not insult religious and moral values," and 
"does not undermine national unity or expose society to 
dangers." The writer says Islam calls for freedom of opinion in 
social, political, and economic issues on which views may 
differ. However, as regards religious issues that are clearly 
defined in written texts, there is no room for different 
opinions. For instance, when Islam says alcohol is banned or a 
thief's hand must be chopped off, there is no room for a 
divergent opinion. 
<H5>  ISLAM IN SINGAPORE </H5>
  On page 20, the newspaper carries a 600-word report on Islam 
in Singapore. The report notes that Muslims constitute 15.5 
percent of Singapore's 3 million inhabitants. It adds that over 
500 people convert to Islam annually. 
<H5>  MUSLIMS IN CAMBODIA </H5>
  On page 20, the newspaper carries a 150-word report on the 
plight of Muslims in Cambodia. The report says the Khmer Rouge 
killed 65,000 Muslims in Cambodia during its reign. The Khmer 
Rouge persecuted non-Communists, especially Muslims whose 
numbers, because of emigration, have shrunk from 800,000 to 
200,000. 
<H5>  VEILED STUDENTS IN FRANCE PREVENTED FROM ENTERING SCHOOLS </H5>
  Citing the Islamic AL-ISLAH magazine, which is published in 
France, the newspaper in a 150-word report on page 21 says that 
over 200 female French-Muslim students are prevented from 
entering their classes because they wear veils. The report also 
noted that France's Muslims are facing a problem because the 
French interior minister has prevented nonresident Muslim 
preachers from participating in the religious enlightenment of 
the Muslims. 
<H5>  BANNING OF SATELLITE DISHES IN SAUDI ARABIA </H5>
  On page 21, the newspaper notes in a 100-word report that 
the 
Saudi Government has decided to ban the importation of satellite 
dishes or their local manufacture. It notes that the Saudi 
Information Ministry will be in charge of receiving satellite 
television programs and will transmit them to viewers through a 
cable system in "a way conforming with religious and social 
values."

<F P=106> [Report by Qusayy Salih al-Darwish: "Zeroual To Begin </F>
Dialogue With Salvation Front Next Week"] 
  [Text] Paris -- An Algerian presidential office statement 
issued yesterday said that President Zeroual would start a 
serious and sincere dialogue next week without excluding any 
party, the aim being to end Algeria's crisis and ensure a return 
to elections. It said that dialogue was the preferred way of 
bringing the situation under control. The presidential 
statement also reaffirmed the need for the security forces to 
continue their duties of maintaining public security, 
safeguarding public property, and eradicating violence and 
terrorism. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from reliable sources that 
President Zeroual will initiate a dialogue with the leaders of 
the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] leaders now in prison, Abbasi 
Madani and Ali Belhadj to be specific. These leaders were moved 
from Blida prison the day before yesterday to an unknown place. 
There have been numerous rumors over the past few weeks about 
the transfer of the FIS leaders to a villa somewhere, but the 
report seems to be genuine this time. The sources, who have 
recently been in contact with President Zeroual, quoted him as 
stressing that he assumed the post of president in order to hold 
a genuine dialogue and that he intended to do so. 
  President Zeroual's statement came after the spectacular 
Lambese jailbreak and after the lengthy meetings of the military 
commands. 
  President Zeroual appears to have been able to settle the 
controversy and disagreement in his favor after the recent 
attacks by the hard-line anti-dialogue tendency as reflected in 
the speech delivered by Prime Minister Redha Malek at the 
funeral of playwright Alloula in Oran and in the campaigns of 
the French-language papers criticizing the regime and its 
failure in an attempt to obstruct President Zeroual, forced him 
into a corner, and put him on the defensive. 
  Behind that campaign were the forces which maintain that the 
fundamentalists should be stamped out and the hardline security 
option, not the dialogue option, upheld. 
  Political observers believe that the death sentences handed 
down to six fundamentalists yesterday were part of the attempts 
to embarrass President Zeroual and part of the arm-twisting 
tactics the hard-liners are trying to use. 
  In view of that situation, President Zeroual is expect to 
reshuffle the cabinet.

those who support a dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front 
[FIS] and those who are opposed to it. It is the first time the 
possibility of a split in the Army has emerged since President 
Major General Liamine Zeroual assumed power 31 January. 
However, well-informed sources have pointed out to AL-HAYAH 
that the talk of a split in the Army is exaggerated in view of 
the staunch relationship between the new president and senior 
officers and the mutual trust between them. The sources pointed 
out that, if there are criticisms against Zeroual in the Army, 
they are focused on the way his aides are chosen, as most of 
them lack experience. 
  Algerian sources have stressed that President Zeroual is 
determined to initiate a "serious dialogue" with all influential 
parties on the Algerian scene, "without excluding anyone," even 
the FIS, which the authorities disbanded after the abolition of 
the legislative election results in January 1992. After that 
the FIS resorted to underground action, launching a war against 
state organs. 
  Numerous parties are opposed to the dialogue with the FIS. 
In the executive authority there are Prime Minister Redha Malek 
and Interior Minister Selim Saadi. Proponents of this -- 
including politicians, thinkers, and media officials -- say that 
a dialogue with the FIS would weaken the prestige of the state, 
which should not submit to pressure from the supporters and 
perpetrators of violence. While the opposition of a major 
tendency inside the military establishment to the dialogue with 
the FIS proceeds from the fear that if the FIS came to power 
this would mean a purge campaign or trials aimed against a 
number of senior officers, the other tendencies' opposition 
proceeds from the conviction that, if the FIS came to power 
democratically, it would not relinquish it democratically. 
  The disagreement between those supporting dialogue and those 
opposed to it has remained concealed within the regime over the 
past two years. The tendency opposed to the dialogue remained 
on the winning side until Maj. Gen. Liamine Zeroual assumed the 
presidency. But this change in the pyramid of power did not 
abolish the oppositionists, who are still inside the military 
command and at the head of government. 
  Some sources say that parties linked to those opposed to the 
dialogue are behind many of the acts of violence and revenge 
witnessed in the country recently, as these parties killed 
members of the armed Islamic groups or some of their relatives 
to avenge the murder operations aimed against elements in the 
security services. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 21 mar (MENA)--Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman have thanked 
President Husni Mubarak for his honest efforts, which 
contributed to reaching the Washington agreement to establish a 
federation between the Bosnian Croats and Muslims. In a 
statement to AL-AHRAM to be published on Tuesday, Izetbegovic 
stressed that the Arab and Islamic countries played a major role 
in the Washington negotiations through calls for a fair Bosnian 
solution. He expressed his hope that strong political and 
economic ties will be established between his country and Egypt. 
  Croatian President Tudjman made a statement to AL-AHRAM in 
which he welcomed the decision by most Arab countries to 
establish diplomatic ties with Croatia. He noted that as Egypt 
is a major country, Croatia will establish strong political, 
economic, and cultural ties with it. 
  The Bosnian president said the Washington agreement between 
the Bosnian Croats and Muslims is positive and fulfills the most 
important aspirations concerning maintaining Bosnia's unity. 
  The Croatian president said the Washington agreement will 
end 
the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and described it as the path 
toward fair peace in the country. 
  Izetbegovic and Tudjman praised the U.S. efforts and the 
efforts of Western countries, primarily Germany, France, and 
Austria, and the Arab and Islamic countries to reach the 
federation agreement. They said they welcome the Serbs joining 
the agreement, providing they accept the unity of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic said the return of the Bosnian 
areas occupied by the Serbs is a condition for any cooperation 
with them. Tudjman stressed that the return of Croatian 
territory occupied by the Serbs for three years is a fair demand. 
  On Bosnia's new constitution signed in Vienna, Izetbegovic 
said that it preserves the national identity of the Muslim 
Bosnians and Catholic Croats by establishing cantons based on 
distinctive national characteristics. He said the new 
constitution that will be ratified by the Bosnian Parliament 
will guarantee the presence of a strong central authority and 
broad powers for the cantons to address issues relating to 
purely national interests. 
  The Croatian president stressed that the new constitution 
guarantees complete equality between the Muslim and Croatian 
peoples in Bosnia. Izetbegovic noted that the federation 
between the Republics of Bosnia and Croatia will achieve two 
practical gains for both parties: Bosnia will obtain the port of 
Ploce on the Adriatic in return for Croatia obtaining an 
unrestricted transit route through Bosnia.

  [Text] Brother Abu 'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], the president of 
the state of Palestine and the chairman of the PLO Executive 
Committee, today received Mr. Viktor Posuvalyuk, envoy of 
Russian President Yeltsin, for the second time in the last 24 
hours. Brother Abu 'Ammar had received the Russian envoy 
yesterday evening and during the meeting was handed a message 
from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev that stressed 
Russia's determination to help with all its resources in the 
implementation of the clauses of the UN Security Council 
resolution after the Israeli massacre in the holy al-Ibrahimi 
mosque in Hebron. 
  The Russian minister said Russia's stance was to regard this 
resolution as of the greatest importance, as well as the need to 
ensure international protection for Palestinian citizens in the 
occupied territories and Russia's return to participating in 
practical measures regarding an international presence in the 
occupied territories. 
  The meeting provided an occasion for President Abu 'Ammar to 
brief the Russian envoy on the latest developments in the 
situation after the UN resolution. He also asked the Russian 
Government in its capacity as a co-sponsor of the peace process 
to hasten the implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolution.

  [Text] The latest news about Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat says the man is angry these days because the Jordanian 
authorities have overlooked the popular media campaign against 
PLO policy and against him personally following the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre. 
  The Khalil al-Rahman Society and some Palestinian camps near 
Amman recently staged mammoth popular demonstrations, during 
which the demonstrators chanted against the old man ['Arafat] 
and demanded him to cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements. The 
Jordanian newspapers, both independent and party papers, also 
launched a campaign in which they called for the cancellation of 
agreements with Israel. 
  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said during the Palestinian 
leadership's meeting in Tunis that this campaign is directed 
against him personally, as well as the PLO leadership. He 
blamed the Jordanian Government for not quelling the 
demonstrators or preventing columnists from writing against him. 
  AL-MUHARRIR has learned that 'Arafat's anger was about to 
express itself in practice when he proposed transferring 15 
Palestinian leaders from Jordan to Tunisia. However, leading 
Palestinian politicians rejected this proposal and considered it 
an attempt to strain relations with Jordan for no convincing 
reason. The proposal was thus frozen pending discussion in 
future meetings.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] The Fatah Central Committee began a series of 
meeting in Tunis yesterday. The 18-man committee, chaired by 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, is discussing the political 
situation and the developments in the occupied territory 
following the issuance of the Security Council resolution on the 
massacre of the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. 
  President 'Arafat called for the meeting the day before 
yesterday. A number of the Fatah Central Committee members, 
including Salim al-Za'nun, also known as Abu-al-Adib; 'Abbas 
Zaki; and Muhammad Jihad, left Amman yesterday morning to attend 
the meetings. 
  In a statement to AL-RA'Y one hour before leaving Amman for 
the Tunisian capital, Salim al-Za'nun -- one of the founders of 
Fatah in 1964 and acting speaker of the Palestine National 
Council -- said: What has been achieved on the political level 
and the [Palestinian-Israeli] talks will top the agenda of this 
meeting, especially following the issuance of the recent 
Security Council resolution. 
  Al-Za'nun said: There will be no going back on the 
Palestinian participation in the coming Arab-Israeli talks, and 
the Palestinian leadership has recently made a decision to 
participate in the talks. He added: We should not be over 
optimistic. Israel is trying to absorb the anger following the 
blatant Hebron massacre; however, the Israelis will return to 
their old methods. Therefore, it is necessary to hold a 
quadripartite meeting comprising Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and 
Lebanon as soon as possible to unify the stand of the countries 
involved in the Arab-Israeli talks. 
  Al-Za'nun described U.S. reservation about the issue of 
Jerusalem in the last Security Council resolution as a blow to 
the Oslo accord. He added: I consider the U.S. reservation 
about the paragraph related to Jerusalem and the occupied 
territory a retreat on the part of Washington from its previous 
stand vis-a-vis these two issues. This negativeness weakens the 
Security Council resolution. 
  Al-Za'nun said: It is true that Security Council Resolution 
904 on the massacre of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron is 
positive with regard to the condemnation of the massacre, but 
there is negativeness in it. The resolution exposed the U.S. 
stand which has delayed the issuance of the resolution all this 
time. 
  Salim al-Za'nun said: The U.S. reservation on the issue of 
Jerusalem together with the statements made by Rabin and the 
U.S. representative at the United Nations -- that Jerusalem is 
the eternal capital of Israel and that it is not a subject to 
discussion -- is a serious matter. This is considered a blow to 
the Oslo accord which placed the issue of Jerusalem on the 
agenda even if after two years. 
  Concluding his statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Za'nun said: 
Jerusalem is of special importance to the Arabs and Muslims. 
Therefore, an Arab and Islamic move is needed to discuss this 
issue as an integral part of the Arab territory occupied in 1967.

  [Text] Tunis, 21 Mar (MENA)--Samir Ghawshah, member of the 
PLO Executive Committee, has told a MENA correspondent in 
Tunisia that the PLO cannot agree to resume negotiations with 
Israel on the implementation of the Declaration of Principles 
until practical measures are taken to provide international 
protection to the Palestinian people living in the occupied 
territories and until the issue of settlements is satisfactorily 
addressed. 
  Ghawshah pointed out that the PLO Executive Committee met 
under Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat last night. The 
committee discussed the practical measures needed to implement 
UN Security Council 904 on the massacre at al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
The resolution, Ghawshah noted, calls for international 
protection for the Palestinian people. 
  Ghawshah added that the committee also reviewed the outcome 
of 'Arafat's meeting yesterday with an Israeli delegation under 
Amnon Shahaq. The Israeli delegation brought no new proposals 
concerning the practical measures needed to implement the UN 
Security Council resolution, despite the fact that Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 'Arafat in a telephone conversation 
two days ago that the delegation would convey such proposals.

  In a departure statement, Sha'th said that at a time when 
the 
Hebron massacre brought to the fore the issue of settlements, 
the United States and Israel raised the issue of Jerusalem. 
  Sha'th added: Jerusalem will remain the capital of Palestine 
and its future independent state and a capital to all Muslim and 
Christian people in the world. Israel's claims in this regard 
are completely rejected. Jerusalem is an occupied city that is 
subject to all the Geneva conventions and will remain so until 
the occupation ends.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat: "Is This the End?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Following the failure of Palestinian-U.S. talks 
and the success of Israeli-U.S. talks it has become obvious to 
everyone that the U.S. Administration is continuing to pressure 
the Palestinian side in particular, and the Arab parties in 
general, in a bid to renew the talks as if nothing has happened. 
[passage omitted] 
  It has been proven to the world that the concept of security 
for the Palestinians in the occupied territories must be the 
basis of negotiations if they are to succeed. It has also been 
proven that settlements are time bombs and a source of threat to 
any future peace agreement. Hence, the call to dismantle the 
settlements and place the entire settlement issue on the talks' 
agenda. 
  We say that it has been proven to the world that these facts 
are known not only to the Palestinians but to anyone who has 
even a superficial knowledge of the situation on the ground. 
After this convincing evidence to the world and the U.S. 
Administration's continued behavior as if nothing has happened, 
the outcome is that the peace process cannot continue in its 
present form. 
  If the PLO insists that the peace process in its present 
form 
has reached a dead end, and if Israel and the United States 
insist on continuing the peace process, the logical conclusion 
is that the peace process has practically ended. 
  Israel and the United States are trying to seek ways out, 
but 
plainly solutions are needed. What would have happened if the 
PLO had an armed security presence in Gaza and Jericho when the 
Hebron massacre occurred? 
  The thought of this or other scenarios, such as whether the 
Palestinian security forces would have participated in the 
protests, tried to control the protests, or refrained from doing 
anything, can lead to destructive results. Settlements are not 
only a huge obstacle to peace, but easily detonated land mines 
planted between every inch of the same land on which peace must 
prevail. 
  If the present situation continues, the end of the peace 
process will have immense and grave repercussions not only among 
Palestinians but also in the region as a whole. And if the 
United States keeps exerting direct and indirect pressure on the 
Palestinian leadership in a bid to renew the talks for the sake 
of talks, the results of this pressure will have destructive 
effects on the peace process. 
  The statement by President 'Arafat to NEWSWEEK to the effect 
that the Palestinian people will not accept to continue the 
talks in the form that existed before the massacre is best proof 
that the crisis has gone beyond the stage of pressure. It is 
inconceivable for anyone to expect the Palestinian leadership to 
lose the support and backing of its people and also lose the 
chance of making a genuine peace. The U.S. and Israeli 
leaderships must examine for the fourth, fifth, and tenth time 
the Palestinian demands presented to them on Friday morning, 25 
February 1994.

  [Excerpt] The occupied territories -- UN Security Council 
Resolution 904, which condemned the massacre at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, has elicited a wave of reaction in 
the occupied territories. 
  At a news conference yesterday in Jerusalem, Faysal 
al-Husayni, head of the Palestinian negotiating team, said: The 
resolution is in the right direction although it came late. It 
is also insufficient. He added: During this period we were not 
endeavoring for resolutions or promises. What we need are 
measures on the ground not resolutions on paper, which might or 
might not be implemented. To date, we have not seen any 
measures will convince us to resume the talks. 
  Al-Husayni said: We view with extreme gravity the U.S. 
abstention on Jerusalem. He hoped that this had been caused by 
reasons of procedure rather than substance, that the U.S. stance 
on the issue of Jerusalem will remain firm, and that a suitable 
opportunity will arise for the United States to modify its 
position. 
  In answer to a question about Palestinian terms for resuming 
the talks after the Security Council resolution, al-Husayni 
stressed that implementation of measures on the ground leading 
to the protection of the Palestinian people; measures against 
the settlements, especially those situated in the midst of the 
Palestinian populations such as in Hebron; and other measures 
relating to the future of settlements will help to speed up the 
resumption of talks. 
  Attorney Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, member of the Palestinian 
delegation, said that if the Security Council resolution is 
implemented, it will definitely open the way to the resumption 
of talks. 
  Reacting to the resolution, Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi said 
that it does not meet the requirements of the Palestinian 
position. The insistence of the United States in excluding East 
Jerusalem from the resolution's text and its reservation in 
interpreting "the occupied territories," under the pretext that 
this concerns an issue of sovereignty, are unacceptable excuses 
that do not conform with an objective viewpoint and logic and 
harm the peace process. 'Abd-al- Shafi added: I do not believe 
that this resolution will advance the peace process, rather the 
contrary, it will place obstacles to that process. 
  About his opinion on returning to the negotiating table, 
'Abd-al-Shafi said: In fact, I have to repeat my constant 
statement, namely, that the peace process will not succeed nor 
will it achieve the necessary credibility unless settlement 
activity in all the occupied territories, including Jerusalem, 
is halted. 
  Dr Zakariya al-Agha said that this resolution is weak and 
has 
no value. It is weaker than previous resolutions and lacks any 
mechanism for imlementing any of its clauses. The regrettable 
thing is that the United States expressed reservations on the 
most important clause, namely, not considering Jerusalem part of 
the occupied Palestinian territories. Al-Agha added: This is a 
very grave sign indicating that the United States supports the 
Israeli viewpoint, which regards Jerusalem as part of Israeli 
territory. In the future, the Palestinian leadership should 
take this grave and important matter into account. 
  Al-Agha added: During all this time the United States 
delayed the passage of this resolution and linked it to the 
PLO's agreement to resume the talks. This indicates and exposes 
the U.S. blackmail. 
  Al-Agha stressed his rejection of this resolution, and said: 
I am not the only one who rejects this resolution. I believe 
that all our people reject it also. We, in the occupied 
territories, ask the Palestinian leadership in Tunis to study 
the new situation well, because new things have become obvious 
following the Hebron massacre. The PLO and the Palestinian 
people have put forward conditions and legitimate demands for 
returning to the negotiating table, especially real protection, 
not just an international presence as stipulated by the 
resolution. 
  Al-Agha emphasized that the issue of settlement activity and 
settlements must be placed at the top of the agenda of the 
negotiating process. He said that any delay in this matter will 
be perilous. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman--The Palestine Council for Economic 
Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) is processing 
applications from experts in taxes, customs and financial 
administration and plans to conduct personal interviews late 
this month and early next month. 
  Jawad Naji, head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's 
(PLO) Economic Department in Amman, said there was a good 
response to advertisements in the past two months inviting 
applications from qualified candidates in the Arab World and 
elsewhere. 
  More than 95 per cent of all applicants are Palestinians and 
the rest were both Arabs and non-Arabs, Dr. Naji said, adding 
that the priority of the council was to select heads of 
departments who will then be given leeway to set up the 
departments and recruit their support staff. 
  The 13-member PECDAR was established in late 1993 as PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat as its head and Faruq Qaddumi, chief of 
the Political Department of the PLO, and Muhammad Zuhdi 
al-Nashashibi, head of the Economic Department of the PLO, as 
his two deputies. 
  Other members of the council are: Ahmad Quray' 
(director-general), Hasan Abu-Libdah and Sari Nusaybah (deputy 
directors-general), Sufyan al-Sultan, Ibrahim Dikkah, Nabil 
Qassis, Muhammad Samhuri, Khalil al-Hindi, Yusuf Sayigh, Antoine 
Zahlan and Nabil al-Sharif. 
  The council is entrusted with devising a structure for 
economic development and administration for the occupied 
territories during the five-year Palestinian autonomy period 
envisaged in the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO accord. 
  It will also draw up plans for development projects in the 
occupied territories and act as a conduit for international 
assistance to support Palestinian self-rule as envisaged in the 
autonomy accord. 
  Dr. Naji rejected suggestions that pressure from donors, who 
have pledged $2 billion in aid to the Palestinians, had prompted 
the council to look for talent outside the PLO. Reports have 
suggested that the donors were insisting that the council be 
administered by qualified economic experts rather than political 
appointees. 
  He said the council had established a good rapport will the 
World Bank, which is coordinating the international effort to 
financially support Palestinian self-rule and develop the 
Palestinian economy. 
  The interviews that the council plans to conduct in Tunis, 
Jerusalem and elsewhere this month and next month will be with 
applicants for the posts of directors of treasury, budget, 
financial administration, internal audit, tax and customs as 
well as computer experts. 
  "We have to have a stream-lined state economy with no less 
responsibilities and functions than those of a full government," 
said Dr. Naji. "As such, every aspect of a national economy has 
to be addressed." 
  The council expects that it needs $400 million for running 
costs during the first year of Palestinian autonomy. A meeting 
of a steering committee supervising aid for Palestinians decided 
in January to allocate up to $160 million to help start autonomy. 
  "That is their estimate, but we believe that the $400 
million 
figure reflects more accurately our actual needs," said Dr. Naji. 
  He said contacts were continuing between the council and the 
steering committee. The panel is meeting in Paris this week to 
review the progress of self-rule arrangements and review 
allocation of funds for specific projects. 
  Some of the donors have already allocated part of their 
pledges to various U.N. agencies already working in the occupied 
territories.

  [Text] Criticism is being voiced in the territories over 
the PLO's decision to conduct negotiations with Israeli 
representatives in Tunis. The Palestinian opponents of the 
peace process call the decision a capitulation on the part of 
the PLO. Statements by PLO activists in support of the process 
have barely been heard. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amir] Notables in the territories have 
criticized the resumption of the negotiations between the PLO 
and Israel. The Security Council resolution disappointed many 
people in the territories who hoped for greater UN support for 
the Palestinian cause in the wake of the Hebron massacre. Dr. 
Mahmud al-Zahhar, who is identified with Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and returned to the territories following 
deportation to Lebanon, said that the current resumption of the 
talks signifies another PLO capitulation to Israel and will 
seriously undermine the scant level of support 'Arafat still 
enjoys in the territories. 
  [Al-Zahhar, in English] The people's reaction now very 
simply is that is a new giving up or renounce from the PLO for 
the benefit of Israel and at the expense of the Palestinian 
side. So I think this will cancel the rest of the popular 
support for 'Arafat in particular. 
  [Amir translates above remarks into Hebrew and continues] 
Palestinian notables from Hebron also criticized the decision to 
hold talks between Palestinian and Israeli officials in Tunis 
today while Hebron residents remain under curfew and a closure 
is still in force in the territories. Palestinians rioted in 
the territories over the weekend in protest against the closure, 
the Hebron massacre, and subsequent incidents. Palestinian 
sources reported that at least 45 people were injured by IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] gunfire in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank. [end recording] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 20 March 
carries 
a related report with recorded remarks by Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar 
in English. Commenting on the results of the peace talks 
between Israel and the PLO so far, Dr. al-Zahhar says: "This 
policy is actually practiced with the PLO and the end result was 
a big zero." Dr. al-Zahhar adds: "I think this failure is 
temporary because of the marked pressure created by the people 
as a result of the massacre in Hebron's al-Ibrahami mosque. 
Sooner or later, they are going to implement autonomy." When 
asked about the possibility of a mass terrorist attack by 
'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, the Hamas' military arm, Dr. al-Zahhar 
says: "Nobody can actually tell what is going to happen, 
because you know, this is a very secret organization. Nobody 
actually understands their attitude at this moment. They are a 
very secret organization and have no relation to the well-known 
people."]

  [Excerpts] Security forces in Gaza have captured a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] member on the wanted list. Subhi 
Abu-Khalil is suspected of having killed Palestinians who were 
believed to have cooperated with Israel. 
  In the village of 'Anabta in Samaria, a Palestinian was 
wounded when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers. [passage

  An Israeli was lightly wounded in the head when he was hit 
by 
a stone while he was driving on the Ben Shemen-Jerusalem road, 
near the village of Bayt 'Ur al-Tahta. 
  The Tel Aviv Magistrates Court has sentenced Gaza resident 
Masrah Barbah to life in prison, after finding him guilty in the 
murder of Moshe Becker, a citrus grower from Rehovot, two months 
ago. Another suspect in the murder, Hani Abu-Sittah, denied the 
charges and is currently being tried.

  [Text] Gaza -- The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine 
issued a statement yesterday in which it called on all 
political, Islamic, and national factions to stop competing 
strikes, which have surpassed the limits of logic and wisdom. 
  The movement said: We appeal to all factions to ease rather 
than make the masses burdens heavier by sudden strikes, which 
are called upon the martyrdom of young men from all factions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Falsehood -- Right"] </F>
  [Text] We can only wish a long life to U.S. President 
Clinton, because by the grace of God he is more aware and 
conscious of the Palestinian problem, especially the issue of 
Jerusalem, than any of his predecessors. In as much as he is 
familiar with the issue of Jerusalem, he could find no better 
opportunity to affirm that a unified Jerusalem was Israel's 
capital other than in these delicate circumstances through which 
the talks are passing. Since 1967, on the basis of UN Security 
Council resolutions, the U.S. position has continued to reject 
the annexation of the Arab part of Jerusalem to Israel. In his 
meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, Clinton said that the United 
States refuses to refer to Arab Jerusalem as part of the 
occupied territories. He did this in order to arouse the 
emotions of the Jews and gain their trust at a time when he 
finds himself involved in an investment bank scandal in his 
state, Arkansas, of which he was governor before winning the 
White House. 
  If the Oslo accord postponed discussion of the Jerusalem 
issue until the final settlement stages, Clinton's remarks 
dissipated hopes that the United States would remain committed 
to international legitimacy and implementation of Security 
Council resolutions relating to Jerusalem. Instead of adopting 
a position that renews the desire by the Palestinians to return 
to the talks and implement the Oslo accord, Clinton, "with his 
wisdom" and long experience in foreign affairs, saw fit to pour 
salt on the wound by raising the Jerusalem issue at this time 
and place. The United States, instead of adopting the position 
of a neutral partner and attempting to build confidence between 
the Palestinians and the Israelis following the damage created 
by the Hebron massacre, has now adopted a pro-Israeli position 
that retreats from previous U.S. positions on Jerusalem. 
  What is a cause for ridicule is the contradiction in 
President Clinton's stance. In the blessed night of the Koran's 
revelation he addressed the Muslims and tried to display 
feelings of friendship toward them. A few days later came 
Clinton's position, hostile to Islam and the Muslims, who 
consider Jerusalem to be the first Qiblah and the third holiest 
site. On one hand he congratulates the Islamic nation on the 
great night of the Koran's revelation, and on the other he 
defies the feelings of this nation by insisting on a position 
biased toward Israel with respect to the issue of Jerusalem, as 
if he is not aware of the extent of this nation's link to 
Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa Mosque and of the fact that more than 
one billion world Muslims reject Arab Jerusalem remaining under 
Israeli control. Moreover, a just and comprehensive settlement 
in the region cannot be reached without finding a solution to 
this sensitive issue that satisfies the three religions of 
Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. 
  Although we are grateful to President Clinton for 
congratulating us on the night of the Koran's revelation and the 
blessed 'Id al- Fitr, his second message which he sent through 
the American Jewish leaders, whom he met two days ago, is more 
impressive and bitter. That requires the Islamic nation to 
resist and confront this message because it represents a 
challenge to the Islamic and Arab nations, regardless of whether 
this was an intentional act or a failure to realize the danger 
of this U.S. position on relations between our Islamic and Arab 
worlds and his Western world as well as the fact that this 
position could lead to derailing the talks and the entire peace 
process. This pro-Israeli and biased U.S. stance on Jerusalem 
increases Israeli intransigence on the issue of Jerusalem, on 
Israel's plans to reduce the Arab presence in the city and 
Judaize the remainder of the holy city, and diminishes the 
chances of a peace whose crux is Jerusalem. 
  We say to President Clinton and the U.S. Administration that 
this U.S. position increases the Palestinian people's 
persistence to continue the political struggle until they 
achieve their freedom and regain their rights. 
  This U.S. position will help to unite the Palestinian ranks 
and to search for common denominators among the various groups 
and factions. We add: If this was the U.S. response to the 
Hebron massacre, in which the Palestinians were the victims, how 
will the U.S. response be if the Israelis are the victims? What 
a calamity it is when the United States turns falsehood into 
truth.

  [Text] The thing that arouses concern about the UN 
Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre is not the 
resolution itself, but the foot-dragging that sought to empty it 
of any meaning or practical use. All this, however, is needless 
repetition and self-evident truth known by everyone. 
  Even graver than this is what news agencies reported about 
the U.S. abstention on one of the resolution's clauses. That 
clause considers Jerusalem to be part of the Arab territories 
occupied in 1967 and the same international resolutions and 
negotiating points of reference applying to those territories 
also apply to Jerusalem. 
  It is common knowledge that after the massacre at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque, U.S. pressure continued on the Palestinian 
leadership in a bid to empty the resoution of content. 
Washington linked its approval of the resolution to the 
Palestinians' resumption of negotiations with Israel. In other 
words, the United States adopted the Israeli stance. The 
Palestinian leadership's refusal to deal with the U.S. position 
delayed voting on the draft resolution for three weeks. 
  This U.S. stance, biased in favor of Israel, encouraged it 
to 
continue its settlement policy in the occupied Arab territories, 
particularly in the Jerusalem area, where various Israeli 
ministries are making plans to build more settlements and 
settlement neighborhoods in a bid to impose a new fait accompli. 
  All Arab and Islamic parties concerned with the future of 
the 
occupied Palestinian territories, foremost of all Jerusalem, 
must realize these facts and act to confront designs and plans 
aimed at the Arab presence in the holy city. Inalienable 
Palestinian rights include all the occupied territories, which 
begin from Jerusalem and end in Jerusalem.

  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton did not have anything encouraging to say 
to the Palestinians in their joint press conference at the White 
House March 16. Both leaders simply urged the PLO to resume 
peace talks without making any reference to the security needs 
of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. 
  What brought the peace process to a halt was the simple fact 
that the two million unarmed and unprotected Palestinian 
civilians in the territories are prey to the whims of Israeli 
terrorists. The statement of the Israeli border guard commander 
in front of the Israeli Commission of Inquiry that soldiers have 
clear orders not to open fire at Jewish settlers even if the 
latter were in the act of shooting at unarmed Palestinian 
civilians underscores the danger facing the Palestinian 
population and Israel's reluctance to deal with it. 
  This revelation did not come as a surprise to the 
Palestinians, who knew it existed long before the border guard 
commander announced it publicly. They have had enough 
experience with settlers opening fire at them without the 
soldiers or government doing anything about it. 
  The Israeli government's reluctance to deal with settlers 
shooting at Palestinians, as well as the light sentences given 
to Israelis for killing Palestinians without reason, is what 
encourages Israeli terrorists to continue with their murderous 
acts. They know that in the end they will be treated like 
heroes among their people and may even become members of the 
Israeli parliament or even ministers in the government. They do 
not have to worry about the consequences of their acts on their 
families, property and compatriots like Palestinians do. 
  If it was a Palestinian who killed an Israeli, then his home 
would be demolished and his family dislodged; his village and 
maybe the whole town would be placed under curfew for days and 
weeks and harassed on a daily basis by the army and settlers; 
several hundred Palestinians would be rounded up and sent either 
to prison or exiled; and the person who committed the act would 
get a life sentence plus many more years for every death or 
injury he brought about. 
  Israeli justice is far from being just. It assumes the 
Israeli idea of right or wrong. For this reason Palestinians 
demand international intervention, and rightly so, for their 
sake and for the sake of the peace process on the whole.

  [Text] The peace negotiations between the government and 
the rebel movement will resume in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi 
on 21 March, under the framework of the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD]. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, the official spokesman 
for the government delegation to the peace negotiations, has 
revealed that some elements of the so-called national democratic 
alliance have arrived in Nairobi with the aim of aborting the 
IGADD initiative. During a press conference he held yesterday 
he said he had apprised the Kenyan authorities of this negative 
development, saying that the members of the alliance, who 
represent the opposition parties, aimed at bringing about the 
overthrow of the government and wanted to exploit the issue of 
the south to bring their ambitions to realization, while the 
issue of peace in Sudan was of no concern to them. 
  His excellency appealed to the Kenyan Government to take the 
necessary steps to ensure that the current peace efforts did not 
fail and that the solution should be purely an African one. His 
excellency said that the members of the alliance who had arrived 
in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad 
Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the 
government delegation did not object to their presence provided 
they did so as part of the delegation of the rebel movement. 
  Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of a 
foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to 
arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency 
appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said 
the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform 
the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to 
confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the 
negotiations should succeed.

  [Text] The official peace negotiations between the Sudanese 
Government and the rebels will open in the Kenyan capital, 
Nairobi at 1000 Kenyan time, 0900 Sudanese time, under the 
supervision of the committee of the leaders of the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development, Kenya, 
Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea in the presence of the foreign 
ministers of these states. Today's session will be held at the 
Kenyan Foreign Ministry, while subsequent sessions will be held 
at a different venue which has not yet been announced. 
  The delegation of the Sudanese Government will be headed by 
Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the Transitional 
National Assembly, and also includes Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, 
the official spokesman for the government delegation; Dr. Nafi 
Ali Nafi, Agnes Lokudu, Angelo Beda, Dr. 'Abd al-Rahman Ibrahim, 
Mathiang Malwal, Musa Sid Ahmad, Peter Charliman, and 'Abd 
al-Raziq al-Fadl, as well as Sudan's ambassadors to Kenya, Addis 
Ababa, and Uganda. 
  For the rebels, the delegation of Garang's faction will be 
headed by Salva Kiir Mayar Dit, Yusuf Kuwah, Philip Lomoding, 
Stephen Wani, Justin Yaak, and others. 
  The delegation of the United Faction will be headed by 
(Richard Mola) and its members comprise (Dhol Ashwal), Arok 
Thuon Arok, John Luk Jok, Dr. Peter Adhok, and others. 
  The radio correspondent in Nairobi says that the most 
positive indicators pointing to the success of these 
negotiations is the presence of the leaders of the two rebel 
factions, Garang and Machar, at the opening session. This has 
never happened before at any of the earlier rounds of talks. 
Their presence indicates confidence in the negotiations. 
Moreover, Kenya's President Moi, in his speech to the opening 
session, stressed the need for these negotiations to succeed so 
that Africa could demonstrate to the whole world its capacity to 
solve its problems by itself. 
  The current negotiations will have as their starting point 
the point at which the two sides arrived at in the earlier 
rounds at Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Abuja One and Two. It is worth 
noting that the Sudanese delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin 
Khalifah is fully mandated to sign the agreement to be reached.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 21 Mar (KNA) -- The Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] committee of heads 
of state on the Sudan conflict consisting of its chairman, His 
Excellency Daniel arap Moi, president of the Republic of Kenya, 
His Excellency Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, president of the Republic 
of Uganda, His Excellency Meles Zenawi, president of the 
transitional government of Ethiopia and His Excellency Isayas 
Afewerki, president of the state of Eritrea, held its third 
session on 17 March, 1994. 
  The IGADD committee met with Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan 
al-Bashir, president of the Republic of the Sudan and 
subsequently met the leaders of the two Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement/Sudanese People's Liberation Army factions, 
Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, and conducted intensive 
consultations within itself and with the parties concerned and 
agreed to launch the IGADD peace talks on the Sudan. 
  The committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that 
pursuant to the mandate given by the meeting off the IGADD 
summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 6 and 7 September 1993, 
the negotiations shall take into consideration the previous 
efforts in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks 
held in August 1989, Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May 
to June 1992 and April to May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in 
Nairobi. 
  The committee expressed serious concern at the continued 
human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected 
areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall 
allow access to relief agencies to ensure that the relief 
assistance is delivered to the suffering people in those areas. 
  The committee also expressed deep concern that the long 
drawn-out conflict was a threat to peace and security in the 
sub-region. In reference to their stated commitment to the 
IGADD peace initiative including their readiness to immediately 
embark on negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to 
send to the peace talks high-level delegations with a full 
mandate to negotiate. The committee called upon the parties 
concerned to the conflict to exercise restraint and desist from 
escalating hostilities, including actions that might jeopardise 
the IGADD initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere 
for the conduct of negotiations. 
  The IGADD committee decided that the standing committee of 
ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace 
negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD 
committee and directed the standing committee to start the 
negotiating process immediately. 
  The IGADD committee further appealed to the international 
community to continue supporting the initiative. [passage

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Ben Ali; place and date </F>
not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful. 
We are celebrating these days the anniversary of the 
independence and the youth day in faithfulness to our martyrs 
and fighters. The two days are symbols of the impregnability of 
the country, and we celebrate them out of our renewed 
determination to continue upholding the country's values and to 
face up to the challenges, thanks to the will of its sons and 
daughters. 
  The importance of these celebrations has been increased by 
the presidential and legislative elections, which embodied in a 
very good way the maturity characterizing the Tunisian people 
and the country's worthiness of a developed democratic life. 
  Citizens, men, and women, you have cast your vote after 
reflection and out of conviction, and you have expressed your 
choice out of your pure will within the framework of 
transparence and clarity. You expressed your choice with the 
full respect of the rule of law and the commitment to civilized 
behavior, which I had called for since the beginning of the 
election campaign on the basis of the principles and values upon 
which the new year was erected. 
  It is my pleasure on this occasion to express my sincere 
thanks and appreciation to all the voters, men, and women from 
all social groups, ages, and regions, who voted for me here and 
abroad. I also express my gratitude to all those who 
volunteered to support the presidential election campaign, 
including the national organizations, the media, and all the 
bodies, groups, and individuals, and I fully value their loyalty. 
  I renew my determination and pledge to fully shoulder the 
responsibility as much as I can to continue with all the 
Tunisians, men, and women the completion of the marvelous 
national project we started building step by step on 7 November 
1987 and whose edifice is getting bigger day after day thanks to 
your positive response and contribution. You have renewed your 
pledge to continue raising this edifice higher and higher by 
voting for it spontaneously and in big numbers. 
  I take this occasion to congratulate the winners in the 
legislative elections from all the national political parties 
that expressed their support for the national civilized project 
and contributed to the materialization of pluralism in the House 
of Deputies for the first time in Tunisia's modern history. 
  Citizens: Now that the results of these elections have 
become clear, the national duty and Tunisia's right on us demand 
that we put its interest above any consideration. It requires 
us all to get to work again and pursue the efforts within the 
state of law, institutions, human rights, and the framework of a 
consolidated and balanced society to face up to present and 
future challenges. We must take our country in all sectors to 
the level of advanced and developed countries, endeavoring 
together for its lasting glory and esteem. May God give us 
success and may His peace, mercy, and blessing be upon you.

Islamic army and mojahedin of Baghlan Province captured Dar-e 
Ashraf and security posts around Karkar coal mine in their 
recent operations, and in the course of [word indistinct] 
operation cleared a number of areas of Golboddin-Dostom militia. 
In the course of the operation 1000 armed men joined the ranks 
of the Islamic army. In recent days mojahedin of the northern 
provinces of the country and the armed forces have cleared many 
areas one after another, and have freed the afflicted people of 
those areas from the oppression of Golboddin and Dostum. After 
the conquest of the North Salang, Khinjan, Doshi, and Konduz 
Province, the advance of the Islamic army and mojahedin continue 
toward Pol-e Khomri and Mazar-e Sharif.

towards Pol-e Khomri and Dara-e Kayan continues. And losing 
their combat morale, militia leave battle fronts and escape.

  [Text] India today expressed its desire for an early 
resumption of foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan. This 
was conveyed by the foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, to the 
Pakistan's high commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, in New Delhi 
today. Seeking an early positive response from Pakistan, the 
foreign secretary said the talks can either be held in New Delhi 
or Islamabad at the convenience of Pakistan. Mr. Srinivasan 
conveyed New Delhi's formal reply to Pakistan's comments and 
counterproposals on the six Indian nonpapers. 
  Regretting Pakistan's negative approach, Mr. Srinivasan 
reiterated India's desire for a dialogue with Pakistan under the 
Simla agreement on all outstanding issues. The foreign 
secretary conveyed to the high commissioner that India's 
proposals were formulated in absolute realism and flexibility, 
signaling its preparedness to carry forward the process of 
normalization of bilateral relations. 
  According to External Affairs Ministry sources, Mr. 
Srinivasan touched upon each of India's nonpapers and gave an 
assessment of Pakistan's counterproposals. On the proposal to 
maintain peace and tranquillity on the Line of Control, the 
foreign secretary said it is aimed at eliminating tension in the 
relations and is prepared without any prejudice to the positions 
taken by the two governments on larger issues. 
  On Siachen, India regretted that Pakistan has disavowed the 
understanding reached at the talks in New Delhi during November 
1992. However, New Delhi is prepared to hold talks on Siachen 
based on pre-1992 talks. 
  Regarding Sir Creek maritime boundary issue, the foreign 
secretary requested Pakistan to reconsider India's proposal. 
Regarding Tulbul navigation project, Mr. Srinivasan reminded 
Pakistan that its comment is factually incorrect. Indian 
proposal was in the form of a draft agreement which New Delhi is 
prepared to ratify and wanted Pakistan's response to that. 
  Regarding India's proposal to initiate confidence-building 
measures, he said Pakistan's response was not forthcoming. 
Hoping that Islamabad will respond, Mr. Srinivasan said these 
measures will help reduce tensions and improve bilateral 
relations. India welcomes Pakistan's suggestion to include more 
areas in the ambit of joint commission. 
  On Pakistan's nonpapers regarding the modalities of 
conducting a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir, India dismissed 
that there is nothing new in the proposal and New Delhi's stand 
was made clear during the foreign secretary-level talks. 
  Mr. Srinivasan also took up with the Pakistan high 
commissioner the restrictions imposed on the Indian Consulate in 
Karachi by totally blocking the access to the consulate for the 
local public. He hoped the Pakistan authorities will allow the 
Indian Consulate to carry out its functions normally.

  [Text] India today regretted Pakistan's decision to close 
its consulate office in Bombay. Responding to a question at the 
daily briefing in New Delhi today, the spokesman of the External 
Affairs Ministry said Islamabad's action falls into the 
continuing and regrettable pattern of taking negative actions 
which are not conducive to good neighborly relations. He 
pointed out that India has always tried to assist in creating a 
climate in which the Pakistani Consulate can perform its 
functions. Regarding accommodation, the spokesman said Pakistan 
was not interested in certain locations offered by the 
Maharashtra Government as was clarified by the chief minister 
himself. He said Pakistanis themselves know the accommodation 
problem in metropolitan cities and pointed out that India is 
paying markets rates for its properties in Islamabad and Karachi.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Samuel Ved: "Closure of Indian Consulate in </F>
Karachi"] 
  [Text] The closure of the Indian Consulate in Karachi 
caused no surprise after Pakistan announced its decision on 
Sunday that it was closing its consulate in Bombay with 
immediate effect. The Pakistani announcement in Islamabad 
puzzled many here, and more so its logic given by that country's 
Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan. Islamabad alleged that the 
Indian Government had gone back on its commitment to lease the 
Jinnah House for the use of the Consulate General and refused to 
facilitate the acquisition of suitable premises for the 
Consulate General. It also accused the government of 
Maharashtra of making it difficult for the Consulate General to 
carry out its assigned functions. On their very face, these 
charges look flimsy and unconvincing. For example, India is on 
record of having rejected Pakistan's plea for the use of Jinnah 
House as long as 1983 when General Zia approached New Delhi with 
this request. Subsequently, India gave no impression that it was 
not firm on its rejection of the Pakistani request. India was 
also not obliged to find a place for Pakistan in Bombay. 
Pakistan knew it and yet it made the Jinnah House and its 
failure to find a suitable place for its Consulate General as an 
excuse for winding up its work in Bombay. 
  Pakistan seems to have perfected the art of accusing others 
of the sins which it itself commits. India's High Commission in 
Islamabad and its Consulate General in Karachi worked under all 
kinds of trying conditions. In May 1992, a senior diplomat, Mr. 
Rajesh Mittal, was abducted and tortured by Pakistani 
intelligence agencies. It was such an awful incident that even 
Amnesty International deplored it. Before that, the wife of an 
attache was abducted while shopping and questioned about the 
activities of her husband and other staff members of the High 
Commission. In Karachi, the Indian staff was kept under 
constant intimidation. Those Pakistani Sindhis and Muhajirs who 
visited the consulate were branded as Indian agents. In August 
1992, the two countries signed an agreement on the code of 
conduct for treatment of diplomatic, consular personnel in the 
two countries. They reaffirmed their commitment to the Vienna 
Convention of 1962 on diplomatic relations and the Vienna 
Convention of 1963 on consular relations. However, as the year 
1992 came to a close, Pakistan gave this accord its own 
interpretation and asked India to curtail the strength of its 
staff in Karachi to less than one-third, that is, from 68 to 20. 
The Pakistani order mainly hurt the Muhajir community in Sindh. 
Muhajirs are refugees from India. They still have family ties 
in India. The Indian Consulate was issuing 700 visas a day to 
them to visit their relatives. The community which has been 
suffering political deprivations and discriminations because 
mainly of their language, Urdu, will now be denied the facility 
to meet relatives in India. 
  Pakistan's sudden decision to close the consulate in Bombay 
came at a time when India, after the Geneva episode, was trying 
to create conditions for the restart of efforts to normalize 
relations with this important neighbor. This desire has 
received a setback. There could have been two reasons why 
Pakistan chose to close down its consulate at this time. First, 
because of its domestic compulsion, the government of Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto was trying to preempt the reopening of 
India-Pakistan dialogue on normalization of relations. Ms. 
Bhutto finds herself in an acutely embarrassing situation after 
the loss of face in Geneva. She calls it her victory, but the 
opposition remains unconvinced, especially in view of all the 
claims before the withdrawal of Pakistan's resolutions from the 
United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva that a large 
number of commission members were willing to vote for the 
resolution. At present, Ms. Bhutto's government will find it 
difficult to restart negotiations with India. 
  The second reason may be Pakistani intelligence agencies' 
strategy to keep the Muhajirs from meeting their relations in 
India. Muhajirs have been the special target of the military 
operations in Sindh, which began in May 1992. A section of the 
Urdu press feels no compunction in accusing the Muhajirs of 
being anti-Pakistan.

  [Text] In occupied Kashmir, Indian troops have martyred 
another 13 people during their repressive operations at various 
places in the valley. Two brothers were shot dead in Khanbal as 
they were working in the field, while three people were martyred 
in a village near Sopor. The rest of the people were victims of 
Indian atrocities in Hindwara, Baramula, and some other places. 
During these operations, the occupation troops also torched a 
number of houses. In response to the growing Indian atrocities, 
the mojahedin have stepped up their retaliatory attacks and have 
killed four Indian soldiers on Srinagar-Jammu road. According 
to reports, a mojahed commander, Farooq Ahmad Butt, attacked a 
convoy of Indian troops with live grenade. Two soldiers were 
blown to bits, while 11 others were critically injured. The 
mojahed leader was also martyred in the attack.

  [Text] Only those living in a world of make believe will 
shrug off the possibility of the world's two largest democracies 
being on a collision course. The US is still in the process of 
fully coming to terms with its status as the unchallenged global 
power. There is, however, one area where there are not only no 
signs of departure from the old cold war approach, but positive 
evidence of efforts to perpetuate and even enhance the 
traditional anti-Indian thrust of American policy in South Asia. 
This was clearly hinted by the Raphels and Mallots of the State 
Department last year that they were meant to prepare the way for 
a clear-cut anti-Indian edge to US policy now seems obvious from 
the Clinton administration's stubborn reluctance to heed the 
decision of Congress to persist with the Pressler Amendment. 
Since then Senator Pressler has found it necessary to reiterate, 
more vehemently than before, his charge that the administration 
plans to resume military sales to Pakistan banned by the 1985 
amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. Pressler's assertion 
that Pentagon is trying to achieve the aim of effectively 
removing the amendment through the back-door, namely, by making 
a "one-time exception" has now been confirmed by Robin Raphel in 
her deposition before the Ackerman sub-committee. The 
"exception" aims to clear the long-standing proposal to sell 71 
F-16 fighter aircraft to Pakistan. Pressler has warned that the 
withdrawal of the only piece of non-proliferation legislation 
will have disastrous consequences. 
  Before the Soviet Union crumbled in a heap, the rationale 
behind US mollycoddling of successive Pakistani military 
dictators was a blind hatred of the "evil empire" that played 
footsie with socialists in New Delhi. It would have been logical 
if in today's unipolar context, Washington no longer found it 
worth its while to accord preferential status to Pakistan. After 
all, in purely economic terms the lure of an untapped Indian 
market is worth more than the price of courting one Benazir 
Bhutto. However, precisely the opposite is happening. 
  It is to be hoped that no security wiseacre will emerge in 
New Delhi to underplay the proposed sabotage of the Pressler 
Amendment as nothing but a ploy to prevent Lockheed, the 
manufacturers of F- 16, from going under. It is some reassurance 
that Narasimha Rao bluntly told Senator Pressler last month that 
the removal of the Amendment would force India to review its 
defence policy. The Prime Minister was, however, being 
characteristically mild. The antics of the Clinton 
administration call for an entire revision of Indian foreign 
policy to take into account the threat from a democratic, but no 
less "evil empire". Diplomacy is one facet of the 
counter-offensive, but New Delhi may also find it prudent to 
retaliate in other ways, namely by curbing its slavish 
endorsement of US economic hegemonism. There are risks, but 
India must be prepared to take them.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
Pakistan cannot ignore its defense requirements and will 
continue to strengthen its defense forces within its limited 
resources. Addressing the Punjab regiment darbar [meeting] in 
Mardan today, she said Pakistan does not want confrontation with 
any country. However, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir has 
threatened the security of the region. She said Pakistan wants 
a peaceful and an early solution to the Kashmir issue. Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto stressed the need for a united strategy on 
national issues, including Jammu and Kashmir. She called on 
political parties to get together and draw up a joint strategy 
on the issue. The prime minister said the strength of the 
nation depends on the economy and therefore economic development 
of the country is top priority of her government. Referring to 
the law and order situation, she said the government is 
utilizing all its resources to eradicate social evils, including

  [Text] Pakistan has decided to close down its Consulate 
General in Bombay with immediate effect. 
  The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad was called to the 
Foreign Office today and informed of Pakistan's decision. A 
spokesman of the Foreign Office said that this decision was 
taken because the Consulate General found it impossible to 
function effectively due to noncooperative and negative attitude 
of Indian authorities. The spokesman recalled that Indian 
Government had gone back on its commitment to leave the Jinnah 
House for use of the Consulate General in Bombay. The Indian 
authorities had even refused to (?permit) the acquisition of the 
principal premises for the Consulate General. The Maharashtra 
Government had in fact acted in a manner that made it extremely 
difficult for the Consulate General to carry out its assigned 
functions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Breach of Promise .... Iran's </F>
Deposition"] 
  [Text] Pakistan's decision to not pursue a vote on its 
resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 9 
March regarding the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir 
was at the request of the friendly countries of Iran and China. 
Iran assured Pakistan that India would permit a delegation of 
the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] member countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir so as to assess the human rights 
violations there. The Pakistani delegation's spokesman cited 
the Indian pledge as the reason for the decision to not seek a 
vote on the resolution. On the very next day after the 
deferment of the resolution, India's Minister of State for 
External Affairs Salman Khurshid and External Affairs Minister 
Dinesh Singh claimed that India had made no commitment to 
provide an opportunity to the delegation of Islamic countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir and that Pakistan unconditionally 
deferred the vote on the resolution. 
  These statements by the Indian authorities have badly 
affected the position of Pakistan, as the Indian external 
affairs minister had rejected Pakistan's assertions. At this 
juncture, political and media circles in Pakistan urged the 
government to present a correct picture of the situation and say 
whether India had really made any such commitment. In response 
to this, Foreign Secretary Shahryar Khan said Pakistan has 
documentary evidence of India's promise to let the ICO 
delegation visit occupied Kashmir. Now, on arrival at 
Islamabad, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
special emissary and Deputy Foreign Minister Ala-ed-Din 
Borujerdi has said in categorical terms that India promised Iran 
and China that it would allow envoys from Islamic countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir. The categorical announcement of the 
Iranian guest is enough to make it clear that Pakistan's 
assertion is right and that of India is wrong. 
  Definitely, Iran and China would have been surprised and 
anguished over the Indian statements, but certainly no one in 
Pakistan would be surprised about the Indian attitude. We are 
quite familiar with India's record and have experienced its 
numerous silly tricks. India's tendency has always been to make 
promises when it comes under pressure on any problem, but when 
it is relieved of that pressure, it fudges on the promises. We 
experienced two instances of this, in 1948-49 and in 1962. 
Coming under pressure from mojahedin in 1948-49, the Indian 
Government promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir and 
confirmed this in international fora. Soon after that, India 
reneged on that promise. When India had to embrace defeat at 
every step during its war with China in 1962 on the border 
question, it expressed its readiness to hold talks with Pakistan 
on the Kashmir issue and also held six rounds of foreign 
minister-level talks under international pressure. As far as 
the outcome of the talks are concerned, India was not prepared 
to budge from its stubborn posture. The war on the border 
question was over by then and India was out of danger. 
  When Pakistan moved a resolution on the Kashmir issue at 
the UN General Assembly a few months ago, India, through the 
mediation of mutual friends, extended an invitation to Pakistan 
for talks on the Kashmir situation on the condition that 
Pakistan withdraw its resolution. Pakistan accepted the offer 
so as to make it clear to the world that it never refuses to 
hold talks. As a result, bilateral talks were held at the 
beginning of January. Even then, India maintained its unpleasant 
tradition and refused to adopt any reasonable position. 
Therefore, Pakistan was constrained to move its resolution at 
the UN Human Rights Commission. 
  The latest announcement of Ala-ed-Din Borujerdi has once 
again revealed India's falsehood and made it clear that it does 
not honor pledges made at international fora. This statement by 
the Iranian deputy foreign minister has once again put the ball 
in India's court, and now India should either allow the ICO 
delegation to visit Kashmir or become a liar before Iran and 
China in particular and the international community in general. 
India also made the flamboyant claim that it does not want to 
conceal the situation in occupied Kashmir from the eyes of the 
world, and has granted permission to visit to the ambassadors of 
European countries first and to those of neutral countries 
thereafter. The foreign diplomats who visited the state, 
however, while considering the Indian claim regarding the 
situation in occupied Kashmir, have said that they were not 
allowed to tour the state freely. The 10 envoys of the 
delegation were virtual prisoners in the hands of the Indian 
administration. They were not allowed to meet people freely nor 
were they allowed access to the areas of their choice. Those 
who wanted to meet the envoys were not allowed to enter the 
Government Guest House. The diplomats said that wherever they 
went they encountered strong official security, and those who 
met them said without mincing words that they do not want to 
stay with India and that they either want total independence or 
annexation to Pakistan. This account of the diplomats after 
their visit makes it clear that a powerful struggle continues in 
Kashmir for escape from the bondage of India, and India is not 
willing to permit foreign observers to take stock of the 
situation there. If the internal situation bars India from 
permitting the ICO delegation to review the situation in the 
state despite its latest pledge, the people of Pakistan can 
fully understand it. It is the duty of the Government of 
Pakistan to continuously raise the Kashmir issue at 
international fora and follow India closely. It is the moral 
responsibility of Iran and China to ask India to let the ICO 
delegation visit the state as promised. To a great extent, the 
statement of the Iranian deputy foreign minister has disproved 
the propaganda by the opposition in Pakistan against the 
government's deferment of the resolution.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz conferred with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Dr. Ghali in New York today. 
  Following the meeting that lasted for more than one hour, 
'Aziz told journalists that his meeting with the secretary 
general was beneficial and positive. He added that he briefed 
the secretary general on Iraq's position in detail, and 
emphasized that the United Nations should fulfill its 
obligations toward Iraq because Iraq fulfilled its obligations 
toward the United nations. 
  'Aziz emphasized that the main subject is lifting the siege 
on Iraq in accordance with Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, 
especially since Iraq fulfilled all its commitments as 
stipulated in this paragraph and in accordance with the text and 
spirit of Resolution 687. 
  The deputy prime minister explained that the Security 
Council 
should consider this in order to end the suffering of the Iraqi 
people. He said he briefed the secretary general on the full 
picture of Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations, 
especially the Special Commission and the international agencies 
operating in Iraq. 
  'Aziz added that Iraq's relations with the agencies are 
good, 
and the concerned authorities cooperate with these agencies, and 
this is evidence that Iraq is prepared to cooperate with the 
international organizations. 
  'Aziz said Iraq has furnished the evidence of its 
cooperation 
with the international community, in accordance with UN Charter 
and the international law, but some Security Council members 
still maintain their hostile position toward Iraq, and they 
should respect the Security Council resolutions and the 
international law and stop interfering in Iraq's affairs. 
  The deputy prime minister expressed hope that the 
international community and all Security Council members would 
study the situation well in order to lift the siege on Iraq. 
  Tariq 'Aziz also conferred with (Francesco Paolo Voly), 
Italian ambassador to the United Nations at his residence in New 
York today. 'Aziz is scheduled to meet later with Detlef Graf, 
German ambassador to the United Nations, and (Jean Damasan 
Besiman), Rwanda's ambassador and Security Council member.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab in Amman and unattributed report </F>
from London: "Baghdad Planning Military Operation To Open Road 
to Turkey"] 
  [Text] Amid conflicting reports and mounting speculation 
about the nature of the action Baghdad is likely to take in 
implementation of the threats made by senior Iraqi officials 
promising unspecified action in retaliation for the renewal of 
the economic sanctions against Iraq, diplomatic sources have 
revealed that it will be a semi-military step in the direction 
of the north and not the south. 
  The sources say that the Iraqis have for some time been 
considering taking a "dramatic" step to open the land road 
between the Iraqi border and the Turkish border, a major part of 
which is controlled by Kurdish gunmen. That road is of 
considerable strategic and economic importance to Iraq. 
  The sources revealed that the Iraqi Government had some time 
ago raised this matter with the Turkish Government and that 
Ankara was very enthusiastic about it on the following grounds: 
  1. Opening that road would lead to Turkish economic recovery 
and would mean that Turkey would be the only or almost the only 
state with access to the Iraqi markets. It is known that Turkey 
and some other states neighboring Iraq are paid for their 
exports to Iraqi markets in crude or refined oil for local 
consumption. 
  2. Joint Iraqi-Turkish control of that road and border areas 
in general would ease some of the military burdens resulting 
from the presence of elements of the Kurdish Workers Party of 
Turkey in that area. 
  The same sources speak of increasing Iraqi military activity 
in recent days on the northern front and in the direction of the 
road. They do not rule out a sudden and swift Iraqi military 
action to open the road as quickly as possible and present the 
Western alliance and the whole world with a fait accompli. 
  It is generally believed in this connection that Baghdad is 
convinced that the atmosphere at the UN Security Council 
following the positions taken by France, Russia, and China would 
preclude military action against Iraq, particularly if the 
action the latter threatened to take was only confined to 
reopening the land road with Turkey. 
  More than one concerned party believes it to be unlikely 
that 
Iraq would go beyond this limited "tactical" step, and they also 
believe that Baghdad is not about to take any military action in 
the direction of the south on the border with Kuwait and that 
the most it might do there is send a few hundred Iraqi peasants 
back to the land taken from them under the amended border 
demarcation and let them stay there as a form of open sit-in. 
  An Arab diplomat working in Baghdad, however, believes the 
Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government no longer have any will to 
fight and that President Saddam Husayn's mention of the 
possibility of "retaliation" if the embargo continued was 
misunderstood, did not imply any military threat, and was only a 
call on the Iraqis to be patient and to rely on the time factor.

  [Text] Iraq is to take part in the 12th meeting of the OPEC 
Ministerial Committee in charge of monitoring the world oil 
market, scheduled to be held in Geneva next Friday. Oil 
Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad made this announcement to the 
Iraqi News Agency. He said that Iraq would participate in the 
meeting out of its concern for the interests of oil-exporting 
developing countries. He added that the OPEC Ministerial 
Committee in charge of monitoring the oil market would discuss 
the deteriorating situation in the world oil market, where the 
average price for OPEC crude oil recently dropped to $13, an 
extremely low level that has not been seen since the mid- 
eighties. He pointed out that the current price is $8 less than 
the minimum price that the OPEC approved in 1990. 
  The oil minister said that Iraq's absence for the past three 
and a half years, resulting from the unjust and illegitimate 
embargo, severely damaged the interests of oil-exporting 
developing countries in general. These resolutions, he said, 
excluded a very positive and influential force and an important 
balancing factor from the world oil market, pointing out that 
the drop in the current oil price on the world oil market and 
that deteriorating oil revenues of the OPEC member states are 
just two consequences of the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  The oil minister also said that Iraq, which is still 
steadfast through its huge oil potential, its firm principled 
positions, its belief in the need to protect the interests of 
the oil-exporting developing countries, and its compliance with 
the principles of OPEC, was and will continue to be an 
influential force in the oil market and is looking forward to 
playing its full role positively and efficiently after the 
removal of the nightmare of the unjust blockade, which is being 
imposed by the forces that are dissatisfied by Iraq's brave 
positions and its confrontation of their monopolies. 
  He added that Iraq has drawn the attention of all parties 
concerned in OPEC to the dangers of the deteriorating oil price 
that will harm the producers because it will reduce crude oil 
production and oil revenues. The consumer, he said, would also 
sustain losses because of the possibility of a halt to its oil 
revenues and of an imbalance in the oil market. He then 
explained the sound Iraqi position, and said that the 
oil-importing countries have begun to pursue certain polices to 
raise oil prices for the ultimate consumer by imposing huge 
taxes on consumption and using various pretexts to justify these 
polices, including ways to protect the environment, limit the 
rising global temperature, and impose energy and carbon taxes. 
  As a result, he added, oil has become a commodity and a 
suitable tool to collect taxes and revenues for the treasuries 
of consumer countries' governments. Meanwhile, he said, the 
oil-exporting developing countries are suffering from a drop in 
oil prices and from shrinking revenues, at a time when they are 
more entitled than others to these revenues.

  [Excerpts] His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the great 
leader of the Islamic revolution, gave a speech this afternoon, 
on the first day of the New Year, at a gathering of the people 
of Mashhad and pilgrims to the holy shrine of the eighth Imam, 
Imam Reza. 
  He described the nature of the dictatorial system ruling the 
world. He referred to the false propaganda and machinations of 
arrogant powers against Islam and the Iranian nation as clear 
signs of their fear of the lofty ideals of the Islamic system. 
  The great leader of the revolution said the emphasis of the 
Muslim nation and government of Iran on the independence of 
nations and their sovereignty over their own natural resources 
and wealth suits none of the world powers. 
  He said: Today, no call for justice is raised from any 
country except the Iranian nation and Government against the 
oppression committed under the blanket of the new order of 
domination of nations in the world. That is a fact which is 
confirmed and admired by all fair-minded observers throughout 
the world. 
  His eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said the struggle of the 
Iranian nation in the eight-year war imposed by the Iraqi regime 
and the unjust powers backing it was a cause for all arrogant 
powers to fear the Iranian nation. He said: While the world's 
political and economic powers plunder, at the lowest prices, the 
natural resources of developing countries, or countries held 
back, the Iranian people, with their slogan of independence and 
struggle against arrogant powers, continues its course. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution said the great and 
glorious resistance of the Iranian nation over the past 15 years 
has been a source of hope to other nations. Describing the 
conspiracies of the ringleaders of arrogance to crush the 
resistance of the Iranian nation, he said: America's guileful 
remarks in expressing willingness to establish ties with Iran is 
not tantamount to its acceptance of past mistakes or an 
undertaking to mend its ways in the future. It is a deceitful 
and evil move. 
  The great leader of the Islamic revolution said: America has 
said establishing ties with Iran would be subject to the Iranian 
nation discarding its fundamental stances. One of which 
principles is noninterference by arrogant powers in the affairs 
of the Iranian nation. They should know that the great Iranian 
nation, which has an ancient culture and a glorious, historical 
past, has become like tempered steel after overcoming great 
difficulties and would never accept domination by America and 
arrogant powers. 
  Stressing the alertness and presence of every Iranian on 
various scenes, the leader of the Islamic revolution said: 
Today, a great national, Islamic, and divine movement prevails 
throughout Iran and the Iranian nation is proud of what it has 
achieved up to now. The president, statesmen, Majles deputies, 
and the judiciary officials have all risen from the bosom of the 
people and have popular sentiments and direction. And the 
country's officials should, in a joint effort with the help of 
the people, endeavor to overcome shortages and eradicate 
problems. They should traverse this clear course by utilizing 
the blessings of Islam, the Koran, divine guidance, and the 
Imam's [Khomeyni's] instructions. 
  Referring to the Koran's verses and wisdom about the 
necessity for Muslims to be alert, aware, and watchful the great 
leader said: Those who are intoxicated with lust and power are 
negligent. They consider as their enemy those who have been 
awakened by God's guiding light. Therefore, they are trying to 
make them ignorant like themselves and distract them from their 
right path. And the Iranian nation, because of its great divine 
victory in raising the banner of Islam and making proud the name 
of God and the prophets in the world, must today regard the 
mention of God's name and divine guidance as a fundamental issue 
and shed any negligence in various aspects of its life.

<F P=106> [Interview with Majles deputies Qorban 'Ali </F>
Dorri-Najafabandi, Mohammad Reza Bahonar, Morteza Nabavi, and 
Mohsen Yahyavi, by unidentified Central News Unit parliamentary 
correspondent; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Following the approval of the 
General Budget Bill of the country for the year 1373 [starting 
21 March] by the Islamic Consultative Majles and its approval by 
the Guardian Council, we have interviewed a number of Majles 
deputies and the chairmen of specialized committees about the 
major aspects and characteristics of this bill. Concerning the 
changes which have been made in next year's budget, [Qorban 
'Ali] Dorri-Najafabadi, chairman of the Plan and Budget 
Committee of the Islamic Consultative Majles, said: 
  [Dorri-Najafabadi] In the first instance, the changes which 
were made were changes in the revenue which constituted a major 
change between the bill approved by the Majles and the bill 
presented by the government. There was nearly a change of 380 
billion tumans [each tuman is 10 rials] in the general sector. 
If you add to this the government owned companies, the figure 
will show a difference of 1,000 billion tumans between the 
figure approved by the Majles and the figure presented by the 
government in the budget bill. In other words, the figure 
approved by the Majles is less than that proposed by the 
government. Of course, certain mechanisms have been instituted 
so that if certain incomes were received by the government as 
part of their revenue the government would be able to cater for 
it. 
  The next change which we introduced in this connection, is 
stressing and changing the ratio of the revenue [as heard]. We 
have made major changes in the revenue from taxation, especially 
the revenue from customs duty and commercial benefit tax [sud-e 
bazargani]. This was a positive change in the direction of 
supporting the domestic products of the country. First of all, 
we have introduced some savings in the current sector, between 7 
percent and 13 percent [as heard]. We have made subsidies 
universal, so that in the coming year the government will 
provide subsidies for essential goods and medicine as far as it 
can and which can be sustained by the present conditions. 
  We have taken good steps concerning deprived areas, above 
the 
ceiling set by the government budget. Although we have reduced 
the budget by 380 billion tumans, we have not reduced the 
ceiling. On the contrary, we have provided greater assistance, 
we have increased the amount in this budget. 
  [Correspondent] Mohammad Reza Bahonar, deputy from Tehran 
and 
spokesman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Majles, 
also concerning the main elements of the budget and mechanisms 
for preventing an increase in prices and controlling inflation 
believes: 
  [Bahonar] To be able to balance our revenue with our 
expenditure, we have put some pressure on some unnecessary 
government expenditures. In one sentence, if we are going to 
move toward a policy of balancing the budget we should achieve a 
balance between general demand and general supply. Demand has 
two main sources: From the government sector and from the 
people. So far, the pressure has been placed on reducing the 
public demand by increasing prices. However, alongside reducing 
public demand, we can at least reduce the demand by the 
government to some extent. This can be done by reducing 
government expenditure. If the government demand is reduced at 
least to the level of the reduction in public demand, the 
situation of expenditure will be improved in favor of the 
people. I think that if we wish to define in one word the 
characteristics of the 1373 budget compared to previous budgets, 
we should say that it can be summarized as: 
  1. Being more realistic about our revenue; 
  2. Reducing expenditure on the basis of our revenue; 
  3. Concentrating these reductions in unnecessary 
expenditures. Where the expenditure has been necessary not only 
have we not reduced it, on the contrary we have even increased 
it. 
  Another important issue that we can see in the budget is the 
issue of supervising and controlling bank credits. For the 
first time, we have defined bank credits and we have allocated 
55 percent of banking loans and credits to the people. In 
controlling inflation -- the most important reason for which is 
the increase of cash in circulation [roshd-e naqdinegi] -- we 
have controlled this increase in circulation for the coming 
year. In technical language, we have limited the growth in 
banking facilities to 7,000 billion rials [roshd-e mande-ye 
tashilat-e banki ra dar mahdudeh-ye haft hezar milliar rial 
motevaqqef kardim]. If this increase is brought under control, 
and God willing it will be controlled, we hope that next year 
the growth in our cash flow will be about 15 percent. The 
increase in Gross National Product should also be calculated, 
and these two will determine how much is going to be the 
increase in our inflation. 
  [Correspondent] Regarding some of the directions, 
specifics, and also the effects of the rial's exchange rate on 
the amount of foreign currency allocated to subsidize essential 
goods, Morteza Nabavi, a representative of the people of Tehran 
said the following: 
  [Nabavi] Since no mechanism has been thought of to cushion 
the poor members of society against the effects of an increase 
in the price of gasoline and other oil products, the Majles did 
not agree to raise the prices of these products. This was 
welcomed by the people. An increase in the price of these 
products without a program to neutralize the effects of this on 
the life of the oppressed would have increased pressure on the 
people. 
  Last year, the amount of currency allocated to subsidizing 
essential goods was worked out at the exchange rate of seven 
tumans to the dollar. [Words indistinct] This year, the currency 
allocated to subsidizing essential goods was worked out at 175 
tumans. The rial for this has been predicted so that payment 
can be made [as heard]. As a result, as far as the people are 
concerned, the price of essential goods reaching them will not 
change. In other words, the price at which rationed essential 
goods were offered to the people through coupons this year will 
not change next year. 
  [Correspondent] The topic of income generated through the 
sale of oil and other related issues were addressed by Mohsen 
Yahyavi, a deputy from Tehran and the head of the Oil Committee 
of the Islamic Consultative Majles: 
  [Yahyavi] The psychological and technical factors that 
affect 
the production of oil, and also the price of oil, were assessed 
by the Majles during its debate on the budget bill. In the end, 
what the Majles approved, that is for the ceiling of income from 
oil sales for the year 1373, was $10.154 billion. This is 
nearly $1.646 billion less than the income predicted by the 
government. We are now able to provide most of the raw materials 
of our factories. There is less need than before for currency to 
obtain such materials.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal 'Abbadi from parliament] </F>
  [Excerpts] The royal decree adjourning the ordinary session 
of the 12th Parliament as of tomorrow was read at the beginning 
of the House of Representatives' session today. [passage omitted] 
  The House then discussed several issues that were not on the 
agenda, in particular a proposal presented by 20 deputies 
regarding acts by the U.S. Navy that include obstructing 
al-'Aqabah-bound ships and conducting unjustified inspections of 
these ships. Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
commented on this by saying: 
  [Begin al-Majali recording] I met with the U.S. ambassador 
before I came here this morning. I reiterated to him all that 
was in your speech [not further identified] in a very clear way. 
A few weeks ago, we sent a legal memorandum to the Security 
Council to prove this is wrong and illegal. The government is 
following up on this issue. The assistant U.S. secretary of 
state will come [to Jordan] this evening and this issue will 
clearly be on the agenda. During his visit to the United States, 
his majesty the king raised this issue with President Clinton, 
the secretary of defense, and others. In my capacity as the 
prime minister, I went to the committee [not further identified] 
itself and addressed it on this issue with all the strength and 
courage we have. I hope the esteemed House will know that since 
the beginning of this issue the Government of Jordan has taken 
the initiative to deal with it, and even this morning we 
discussed this issue. Thank you. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] The House of Representatives has condemned and 
denounced the U.S. abstention from voting on two clauses of UN 
Resolution 904 that consider Jerusalem an occupied territory. 
The House also condemned a U.S. statement that the Palestinian 
territories are disputed and not occupied territories. 
  In a statement issued today, the House called on Arab and 
Islamic parliaments, as well as the parliaments of states 
upholding just causes, to officially protest against the U.S. 
position. The House said it strongly regretted the poor 
coordination of the Arab delegations at the United Nations, 
which contributed to this result. 
  The House appealed to the kings and presidents of the Arab 
states to call for a summit in order to discuss the situation of 
the Palestinian and Arab people under occupation and shoulder 
their responsibilities toward the brothers who are being exposed 
to a continuous annihilation campaign. 
  The House of Representatives expressed its appreciation for 
the steadfastness of the heroic Palestinian people and their 
legitimate defense of their lands and rights, emphasizing its 
support for these struggling people.

  [Text] Amman--Jordan's 12th Parliament ends its first 
regular session today, with expectations high that it would be 
recalled for an extraordinary session next month to formalise 
several pieces of legislation that the government has forwarded 
to it as emergency laws. [passage omitted] 
  On Monday, the House unanimously approved a proposal made by 
Deputy Samir Habashinah to form a parliamentary delegation to 
visit "understanding" countries to explain the "suffering of 
Iraqis" in view of the U.N. Security Council's recent decision 
to maintain the 43-month-old international sanctions against 
Iraq. 
  Mr. Habashinah (Karak) noted that U.N. inspectors have 
reported that Iraq had complied with the Security Council 
conditions for lifting the sanctions and referred to the futile 
efforts last week by countries such as France, China, Russia, 
Turkey and Iran to issue a Security Council statement 
acknowledging Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. Special 
Commission charged with eliminating its weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  It was not immediately known when the House would form a 
delegation to lobby on behalf of Iraq. 
  During Monday's session, the government answered several 
questions raised by deputies concerning services in their 
districts. 
  Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Dughmi said he reserved his right to 
officially interpellate the government concerning the legality 
of licencing companies offering security services. 
  Mr. al-Dughmi (Mafraq) charged that such companies abuse the 
authority given to them by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in 
a manner that "threatens our security and safety" and get paid 
for it. 
  The deputy asserted that it was no coincidence that his car 
was damaged and Deputy Habashinah's was stolen after the two 
legislators publicly criticised security service companies. 
  The two lawmakers are demanding that licenses issued to the 
private security firms be withdrawn and government forces 
undertake the responsibility of providing security wherever 
needed.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "The New U.S. </F>
Ambassador"] 
  [Text] The new U.S. ambassador to Jordan, Wesley Egan, is 
a heavyweight. Once the second man in the U.S. Embassy in 
Cairo, he also served in Saudi Arabia, two African countries, 
and a European nation. His choice for the new job signals the 
importance the United States attaches to Jordan in terms of 
inter-Arab politics and the Arab-Israeli dispute. 
  Before Egan's appointment became final, he had to go through 
a grueling test in the U.S. Senate, where Senator Daniel 
Moynihan, the Zionist Democrat from New York, presided over the 
hearing that scrutinized the would-be ambassador's credentials 
and went on to confirm his nomination. 
  In his testimony, Egan told the hearing he would work to 
develop relations between the United States and Jordan and 
enhance Jordan's role in the peace process. He pointed out that 
Jordan signed a joint agenda with Israel that will presumably 
culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries. 
  His said his top priority in Amman will be to propel the 
peace process forward and recognize Jordan's energetic role in 
the effort to bring about a comprehensive Middle East peace. 
Mr. Egan will pay special attention to stability in Jordan, and 
watch its democratic march and economic development. He will 
also watch Jordan's approach to a number of other issues: human 
rights, compliance with the sanctions resolution against Iraq, 
terminating the boycott of U.S. companies doing business with 
Israel, the potential for foreign investment both in Jordan and 
elsewhere in the region, and the fight against terrorism. 
  Much as I take exception to some of the issues that will 
engage the new ambassador's attention, I concern myself here 
with a lecture Moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing. 
Discussing the West Bank and Gaza, he dismissed as 
inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied 
territories, and asked: If these are occupied territories, who 
were they occupied by? These territories, contended the 
senator, were never the sovereign domain of anyone; it was 
Jordan that occupied the West Bank at the founding of the state 
of Israel. What Israel did was to take the West Bank from 
Jordan the way it took Gaza from Egypt. Previously, these 
territories were part of the British mandate, and before that 
they fell within the realm of the Ottoman Empire. Mr. 
Moynihan's point, in other words, is that these territories are 
up for grabs. The United States, he noted, never recognized 
Jordan's sovereignty over the West Bank. His bottom line: 
Israel did not occupy territory that was under another nation's 
sovereignty. 
  This Zionist senator's remarks are not supposed to be 
Washington's official line. However, they do mirror an 
undeclared U.S. line dictated by the all-powerful Zionist lobby 
-- a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting 
stance of the United States toward the UN Security Council 
resolution condemning the Hebron massacre.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "For Arab-Muslim Complexion of Jerusalem"] </F>
  [Text] The international community, as well as Arabs and 
Muslims, ought to lend a hand to Jordan's broad-based drive for 
U.S. recognition that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab 
territories. 
  To quote His Majesty King Husayn, it is vital that 
Washington 
be bound by previously U.S.-endorsed UN resolutions granting the 
Arab identity of [east] Jerusalem. 
  We will not beat around the bush. With all honesty we will 
tell all Arab and Muslim nations they have to back the Jordanian 
moves and join His Majesty King Husayn's drive to uphold the 
Arab-Islamic complexion and sanctity of Jerusalem. The absence 
of Arab solidarity and a less-than-firm Islamic position has 
tempted Israel to pursue its expansionist ambitions in the 
occupied Arab territories, most of all in Jerusalem. It has 
also prompted the United States to backtrack on previous 
positions and so abstain on the Jerusalem part of UN Security 
Council Resolution 904. 
  Should this kind of Arab and Islamic position persist, the 
Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem will be commandeered in 
broad daylight with U.S., and maybe international, support. 
  Arab and Muslim leaders cannot afford to remain mere 
spectators as the Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem, the 
al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock is hijacked. It is the 
duty of every Arab and Muslim to strive to maintain the identity 
of this holy city. Under no circumstances should we remain 
passive toward the plot to confiscate Jerusalem's identity and 
Judaize it and its Islamic shrines. 
  Hence our argument that all Arab and Muslim leaders must 
heed 
His Majesty King Husayn's call and join forces with him to 
preempt the confiscation of Jerusalem's identity and bring 
sufficient pressure to bear in the interest of a renewed 
commitment by the U.S. Administration to the UN Security Council 
resolutions according to which Jerusalem is occupied territory 
not subject to annexation by Israel under any circumstances. 
  If the U.S. Administration really cares about a viable peace 
process, it will have to rethink its positions and obligate 
itself to UN resolutions and the terms of reference of the 
Madrid conference that the United States itself initiated. 
Otherwise, the peace process is doomed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Wrong Target] </F>
  [Text] It was unfortunate for Jordan that the U.N. Security 
Council, under pressure from the U.S. and Britain, decided last 
week to extend the sanctions imposed on Iraq 
indefinitely--despite the fact that Iraq has complied with most 
if not all of the Security Council resolutions, especially those 
related to arms control. This extension of the sanctions was 
forced by the United States and the British despite favourable 
reports by U.N. envoys and inclination on the part of the other 
council members--France, Russia and China--to start lifting the 
sanctions regime. The council's decision, of course, did not 
take into consideration the fact that the sanctions are having 
tremendously negative results on the Iraqi people and are doing 
so little to change the Iraqi regime itself. Furthermore, the 
sanctions are taking their toll on Jordan, which has lost 
hundreds of millions of dollars already as a result of abiding 
by them. 
  While trade is being freely practised all along the Iraqi 
borders with Iran, Turkey and Syria, the U.S.-led U.N. naval 
force targets al-Aqabah, Jordan's only sea outlet, for a harsh 
regime of inspection. The Jordanian leadership and Jordanian 
officials have repeatedly complained to the U.S. government over 
such an unfair treatment. And U.S. officials, including 
Secretary Warren Christopher during his last visit here, have 
repeatedly promised to address the matter. So far nothing has 
materialised. This state of affairs is of course unacceptable. 
Jordan is being itself blockaded and by its so-called friends. 
Jordanian businesses are losing in terms of delays and 
diversions of cargo and harassments by the U.N. naval force. 
Under international law, a sea blockade is considered to be war. 
  Jordan has over the decades proved itself a respected and 
respectful member of the international community and an adherent 
of the U.N. Charter and its resolutions. Especially as pertains 
to the Gulf crisis, the Kingdom has abided by all the Security 
Council resolutions. For these reasons we feel that the U.S., 
despite protestations to the country, is targetting the country 
for no good reason at all. The U.S., therefore, needs to 
realise that such policies are counterproductive and threaten 
both the well-being of Jordan and the much-aspired to peace in 
the region.

  [Text] Al-'Aqabah, Jordan, March 20 (AFP) -- Jordan's Red 
Sea port of al-'Aqabah lost 440 million dollars in revenue last 
year because of the UN embargo imposed on its northern neighbor 
Iraq, a shipping official said. 
  "The continued embargo prevents the port of al-'Aqabah from 
developing and resuming the activity level it had in 1989," 
according to Sufyan al-Muhaysin, director of the Jordanian 
shipping agents association. 
  "Trade should have recorded an annual growth of five to 10 
percent in the last four years," he said. 
  In 1993, 1,498 ships docked in Aqaba, compared to 1,552 in 
1989. The port handled a total of 11.55 million tonnes of goods 
last year, down from the 18.5 million tonnes in 1989. 
  The 38 percent drop in activity from 1989 "in fact conceals 
a 
decrease of more than 50 percent compared to what should have 
been recorded in 1993 if there had not been an embargo on Iraq 
and a blockade of the port," he said. 
  Instead of 11.55 million tonnes, the port should have 
handled 
24.2 million tonnes, he said. The resulting loss in revenue for 
1993 was 440 million dollars. 
  Since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis, ships heading to al-'Aqabah 
have had to submit to strict inspections by US, French and 
Australian warships in the Straits of Tiran. 
  Because of these measures designed to stop banned goods from 
reaching Iraq through Jordan, only 19 of the 40 shipping 
companies that used to serve Aqaba before the Gulf crisis 
continue to sail to the port. 
  A shipping source told AFP that Jordanian officials were in 
contact with international organizations to consider a plan to 
put inspectors in the port rather than at sea. 
  The London-based firm Lloyds has agreed to provide 
inspections but a final decision was awaited from the UN 
Security Council, the source said on condition of anonymity. 
  The Security Council imposed the embargo on Iraq days after 
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.

  [Excerpt] Amman--The Arab Land Bank has received an Israeli 
License to reopen two branches in the occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip and plans to start operations in late April, banking 
officials said Saturday [19 March]. 
  They said the bank, whose headquarters are in Cairo, 
received 
the licenses from the Bank of Israel last week after the Central 
Bank of Jordan (CBJ) issued preliminary licences. 
  The bank is seeking to reopen up to five branches in the 
West 
Bank and Gaza Strip but it received Israeli approvals for only 
one branch in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and the other in 
the Gaza Strip, they said. 
  The Arab Land Bank became the second known Jordanian Bank to 
get Israeli licenses in line with a memorandum of understanding 
signed by Jordan and Israel in December. 
  The Bank of Jordan got an Israeli license last week to 
reopen 
a branch in Ramallah in the West Bank. 
  Other Jordanian banks which have received preliminary 
licenses from the CBJ include the Arab Bank, Jordan's largest 
commercial bank, the Jordan-Gulf Bank and the Jordan National 
Bank. The CBJ is known to have issued preliminary licenses for 
a total of eight branches of the five banks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn this evening visited the 
wounded victims from the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre, who 
are receiving medical treatment at the al-Husayn Medical Center 
in Amman and reassured himself about their condition and the 
treatment they receive from their brothers in this esteemed 
medical establishment. 
  The wounded patients expressed thanks and appreciation to 
His 
Majesty King Husayn for his generous Hashemite initiative toward 
the victims of the ugly massacre, committed in the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan, and Jordan's 
honorable pan-Arab position, under the leadership of his majesty 
in support of their brothers the sons of the Palestinian people 
and the holy shrines in all circumstances. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had ordered the formation of a 
higher 
committee to raise donations for the massacre's victims. His 
majesty donated a sum of 100,000 dinars for the victims, and 
ordered that everything possible be provided to assist the 
wounded in Jordanian hospitals. 
  King Husayn was accompanied by His Highness Prince Hamzah 
Bin-al-Husayn, and al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, Royal Hashemite 
Court chief.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Untold Story of the Minor </F>
Pilgrimage"] 
  [Text] The king's visit to Saudi Arabia was the result of a 
an initiative by Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. The 
Yemeni official expressed a desire to visit Saudi Arabia and 
meet with King Fahd following the signing of the Yemeni 
reconciliation agreement in Amman [on 20 February]. King Fahd 
personally spoke on the phone to al-Bid, in the presence of King 
Husayn who was visiting his guest al-Bid at al-Hashimiyah Palace 
in Amman. 
  Al-Bid conveyed to King Fahd greetings from King Husayn, who 
was at his side. When he heard words of welcome from King Fahd, 
al-Bid informed him of King Husayn's desire to speak with him 
and gave the receiver to King Husayn, who expressed a wish to 
visit the holy places to perform the minor pilgrimage. 
  Thus, the Yemeni initiative and the Jordanian desire began 
to 
materialize. 
  During his visit to Saudi Arabia, al-Bid placed on his 
agenda 
the task of paving the way for king Husayn's visit. He 
suggested to King Fahd a meeting with King Husayn. King Fahd 
answered as follows: This requires a decision from the "family" 
and I have no means of making that decision now. 
  The visit was not intended to carry out a religious duty and 
continue a tradition the king has followed for many decades 
during Ramadan, which he was forced to stop following the dire 
consequences and ramifications of the Gulf war over the past 
three years. King Husayn chose to perform the minor pilgrimage 
this year knowing that neither King Fahd, nor Crown Prince 
'Abdallah, nor the second deputy prime minister, Prince Sultan, 
would receive him. 
  The chief of protocol, Ayman al-Majali, went to Saudi Arabia 
and was welcomed by the Saudi authorities. He brought with him 
the program of the visit that contained brief arrangements for 
performing religious rites but contained no meetings with any 
Saudi officials. The official reception at the airport and the 
mission of honor to accompany the king would be confined to 
Prince Sa'ud Bin-'Abd-al-Muhsin Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. 
  Some tried to use their good offices to promote the visit by 
making it an end to the estrangement, and by including Riyadh in 
it. The Jordanian side refused to continue this discussion after 
hearing of conditions that can be mildly described as unjust, 
encroaching on the credibility of the Jordanian stand. The 
required apology would have been correct if one side erred 
against another. In the case of Jordan we cannot be held 
responsible for something that cannot be applied to us. Even if 
the results were in the interest of the [Gulf war] alliance, 
this does not mean they were right in their stand. The facts 
confirm the credibility of the Jordanian position and its option 
not to approve of external intervention, which would bring only 
evil to all the Arab sides, not only Iraq. Iraq lost its 
resources and its ability, which had been a deterrent to the 
others who had been trying to commit aggression against the 
Arabs. The loss also covered the Gulf people who lost their 
savings and resources of their future generations and have 
become captives of foreigners in terms of their sovereignty, 
policy, finance, and economy. 
  To cut a long story short, the mediators failed, but the 
king 
insisted on making the visit and the pilgrimage and to hope for 
a surprise and an initiative at the eleventh hour. The king 
made his decision for more than one reason: 
  1. The king wanted to continue his tradition of performing 
the minor pilgrimage after it stopped following the Gulf war 
disaster. He chose this year to restore this tradition 
exploiting the state of relative ease in ties between Riyadh and 
Amman. 
  2. To end the deadlock with an initiative that would force 
the Saudis to shoulder their moral and political 
responsibilities toward the Jordanian stand, especially since 
Jordan has taken the first step and particularly now, after King 
Fahd has already received Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, 
who was accused of being biased toward the just Iraqi stand. It 
is known here that the Saudi monarch's reception of Yasir 
'Arafat took place upon a U.S. recommendation that was discussed 
between 'Arafat and Christopher at the U.S. ambassador's 
residence in 'Abdun in Amman. Fatah Central Committee Member 
Faysal al-Husayni paved the way for the visit by responding to a 
Saudi invitation that has been kept on hold for two years at the 
instructions of President 'Arafat, who finally allowed the visit 
after he was certain that it would be the first step toward his 
own visit to Riyadh and to his being received by King Fahd when 
he performed the minor pilgrimage. Thus, 'Arafat's visit to 
Riyadh set a precedent for ending the estrangement between 
Riyadh and those Arab parties that rejected the Hafr al-Batin 
logic, the Desert Storm scenario, and the U.S. and foreign 
interference in our region. From this premise, King Husayn 
sought to test the programmed Saudi estrangement in order to 
test the credibility of relations with the United States and 
U.S. promises and claims that it is eager to lift the political 
and economic siege that is imposed on Jordan. 
  3. King Husayn chose his visit to the Islamic holy places on 
Saudi territory to be part of the challenge and to clarify 
things, lest the option of Jordanian-Saudi relations at present 
and in the future emerge as the option that should be adopted. 
But, the exceptional situation that resulted from the Gulf 
crisis imposed itself on this visit. 
  Those who are conversant with what is going on attribute the 
interruption in the trend toward ending the estrangement and 
restoring the relations between Riyadh and Amman to foreign 
interference. It is the same interference that still imposes a 
political and economic siege on Jordan, and carries out 
instigations against Amman, not only because of its stands on 
the Gulf crisis and its results, but because of the Jordanian 
refusal to sign a draft peace treaty with Israel. U.S. 
President Clinton officially asked King Husayn during the 
latter's recent visit to Washington to reach a draft peace 
treaty with the Israelis. However, Jordan did not budge from 
its explicit and firm stand that there will be no peace treaty 
with the Israelis before the others, and that if they do not all 
sign at the same time, then Jordan will be after them. This 
Jordanian stand has its consequences. Do the Jordanians have 
the requisites to stand fast in the face of the pressure, 
blackmail, and all forms of siege?

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The establishment of the 
Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho will be given top 
priority in the resuming talks with the PLO and in the 
preliminary contacts. Israeli sources noted that Israel has 
acceded to the PLO demand to actually make it a paramilitary 
force, alongside the "blues." 
  In recent days, the PLO leadership has given its permission 
to reinstate some of the policemen who served under Israel and 
who quit their jobs during the intifadah. PLO official Ziyad 
'Arif met last Saturday in Khan Yunus with those policemen. He 
told them to be ready to return to service on 15 April and 
handed them their first salary. 
  The Israeli sources pointed out that this police force will 
begin operating in the autonomy areas before the Palestine 
Liberation Army deploys its troops and will work in coordination 
with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] authorities until the 
Israeli withdrawal.

The hunt continues for Marzel. Last night, police detectives 
searched the home in Petah Tiqva of Kakh activist Natan Levi. 
Levi told a Qol Yisra'el reporter that he has no idea where 
Marzel is and that he doesn't think Marzel would hide out at the 
home of someone identified with Kakh. 
  Marzel, who has been in hiding for several weeks, has said 
he 
would turn himself in with the mediation of several Knesset 
members, including Avraham Ravitz of the United Torah Party, but 
Shahal said the law forbids him to respond to such conditions.

  [Editorial Report] Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 
1130 GMT and 1600 GMT on 21 March report on the morning and 
afternoon sessions of the commission of inquiry into the Hebron 
massacre. 
  In the morning, the commission heard testimony from 
Brigadier 
General Moshe Ya'alon, the former commander of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] in Judaea and Samaria, who told the commission 
that "it had not been foreseen and that he did not prepare 
contingency plans for events he considered remote from reality." 
The committee heard testimony behind closed doors from Colonel 
Moshe Zarqa, the IDF intelligence officer in Judaea and Samaria. 
  Harley Braidman reports: "Brig. Ya'alon told the committee 
that from the evidence so far it emerges that among officers and 
men there was a misunderstanding about the order not to fire at 
Jews and this needed correction. He said there were many 
confrontations between Arabs and Jews at the Patriarchs' Cave, 
mainly over prayer arrangements. Ya'alon made it clear that it 
was decided to allow Jewish worshipers to enter the cave armed 
because of the attacks against Jews in the Hebron area. Even 
after the massacre no hasty conclusions should be drawn about 
the license to carry weapons there in view of the concern that a 
large number of Arab worshipers might attack Jews. 
  "As for the orders on opening fire, the brigadier said there 
was clear discrimination because sometimes during Arab rioting 
the soldiers' lives were endangered and they had permission to 
start shooting in certain circumstances. One the other hand, 
there was no permission to fire on Jewish worshipers because the 
possibility of a Jew attacking a soldier was not envisaged. He 
also noted that the use of tear gas against Jewish rioters 
required special approval by the commander of Israeli forces in 
Judaea and Samaria. Ya'alon added: It was obvious that the 
soldiers seeing somebody commit a grave crime endangering the 
lives of others should intervene to prevent that crime and even 
shoot the perpetrator." 
  In the afternoon, the commission heard testimony from Brig. 
Gen. Gadi Zohar, head of the Civil Administration in Judaea and 
Samaria, who said that the Cave of the Patriarchs "had been a 
source of tension for years between Arabs and Jews." 
  Harley Braidman reports: "Zohar said it is not mission 
impossible to make satisfactory prayer arrangements for Jews and 
Arabs at the Patriarchs' Cave, but it is problematic. The 
Muslims believe the presence of Jews in the place which they 
think belongs to them is a slight. They acquiesce in silence 
with the status quo, but are prepared to make prayer 
arrangements. The Jews, Zohar added, are trying to base a 
permanent presence in Isaac's Hall to the chagrin of the 
Muslims. Both sides attempt to change specifics. The constant 
changes in Muslim and Jewish holidays are a source of tension, 
he said. The issues have been raised in discussions with the 
Central Region commander and in the Forum for the Territories 
with the participation of Defense Minister Rabin. Prayer 
arrangements are now being discussed with the Civil 
Administration and when the cave is reopened there may be new 
arrangements. Zohar also was not happy about the way the police 
functioned at the cave because it had failed to deal effectively 
with a string of illegal incidents there, such as throwing acid 
on carpets and tearing off mezuzot."

<F P=106> [Article by Roni Shaqed: "The Investigators Were Appointed </F>
According to Clan Affiliation"] 
  [Text] Six days after the Hebron massacre, the Academics 
Association offices in Hebron received the following faxed 
message: "In view of my authority, and in view of the 
circumstances, I hereby order the establishment of a commission 
of inquiry into the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. The 
Commission is to present its findings to the PLO Executive 
Committee as soon as possible." The message was signed by 
"Yasir 'Arafat, President of the State of Palestine." 
  Attorney Hashim Salman al-Qawasimi was appointed chairman of 
the commission of inquiry. He was named along with five 
lawyers, three physicians, two clergymen, and two public 
figures; all Hebron residents who represent the large families 
in the city. 
  "I was surprised by the appointment," al-Qawasimi said last 
week. "No one called me from Tunis, and no one in the 
territories has spoken to me about setting up the committee." 
Al-Qawasimi, 50, had worked for 17 years for the Civil 
Administration judicial system in the West Bank. In his last 
duty he was president of the Ramallah District Court. He has 
engaged in private practice since 1985 and is not politically 
affiliated with any camp. "Being a judicial investigator, I 
take orders from no one, nor am I subject to any element," he 
said. "This is a professional, not a political committee, and 
its job is finding the truth." 
  Last Friday, a day after they received the letter of 
appointment, the members of the committee convened and 
established working procedures. The five lawyers were tasked 
with collecting evidence and eye-witness testimonies. The three 
physicians were to collect medical evidence. The remaining 
three committee members were to collect evidence linked with the 
cave itself. The committee wishes to end its work in two weeks, 
at the most. To this end, they are assisted by Hebron attorneys 
who collect testimonies of eye witnesses and the wounded. 
  The Hebron committee has managed to obtain testimonies from 
several Israelis. "We received written testimonies which were 
legally obtained. I will not say whether they were from 
civilians or servicemen," al-Qawasimi said. 
  Last weekend, al-Qawasimi drafted a letter addressed to the 
military governor of Hebron, asking for permission to question 
Army soldiers and officers. He is about to send a copy of the 
letter to the defense minister. "We have to question anyone who 
witnessed the massacre, including Israelis. If we are allowed 
to question Israelis, it would be a precedent and will serve as 
basis for future cooperation," al-Qawasimi said. 
  [Shaqed] Why not cooperate with the Israeli commission of 
inquiry? 
  [Al-Qawasimi] Our committee has no authority to judge those 
responsible; we cannot judge those who govern us. Thus, 
cooperation with the Israeli commission will never be on an 
equal basis. Also, if we ask for their cooperation, they would 
not agree." [end al-Qawasimi] 
  Fayiz Qapishah, a committee member considered a 
representative of the families of the wounded, does not rule out 
cooperation with the Israeli commission. "I am willing to 
testify before the Israeli committee, provided that my remarks 
are publicized. In the end, we want to find the truth." 
  Last week, the members of the committee did not listen to 
Qol 
Yisra'el in Arabic which carried live the Shamgar commission 
deliberations with simultaneous translation. Only after the 
Israeli committee members toured Hebron last Wednesday did those 
siding with cooperating with it win the upper hand. One of the 
offers raised was to officially ask Israel to cooperate with the 
commission. This way the Hebron committee hopes to obtain 
material which is in the hands of Israel, such as the videotapes 
of the cave cameras. 
  Other voices were heard as well, however. "The Israeli 
committee represents the side that committed the murders. It 
was established to whitewash the Israeli administration," said 
'Ali al-Qawasimi, who is considered the Hebron Fatah leader. 
"Whether we trust the Shamgar committee will be determined in 
lieu of its conclusions." 
  One of the central questions the Hebron committee wishes to 
determine is whether Barukh Goldstein operated alone or was 
aided by others. Many eyewitnesses told the committee that IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldiers also shot at the worshipers. 
One of them said that one of the soldiers was standing next to 
Goldstein and handed him magazines. As a rule, the residents of 
Hebron find it hard to believe that Goldstein managed to kill 
and injure so many worshipers with only 111 bullets. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid al-Ashhab, the head of the committee's 
medical team, said: "Most of the people were shot in the back, 
but some were shot in the side of their body, which indicates 
that some of the fire came from a different direction. In the 
X-Ray pictures we identified metal of other objects that do not 
look like slugs. Perhaps it was shrapnel. This may indicate 
that the murderer also threw hand grenades." 
  Another member of the committee, former Hebron Mayor Mustafa 
'Abd-al-Nabi al-Natshah, tried to sound more careful: "Our 
evidence indicate that the murderer threw two hand grenades. I 
would say there is a 90-percent probability that he used hand 
grenades. Also, we cannot yet clearly determine that he acted 
alone. This will only become apparent at the end of the 
investigation." 
  Another issue the committee wants to determine is the 
precise 
number of casualties of the massacre and the shooting outside 
the Cave of the Patriarchs. Until this day, two weeks after the 
massacre, there no final figure. The IDF determined that 29 
were killed and some 50 were wounded in the incident. The 
residents of Hebron say that 32 were killed and some 200 were 
wounded in the massacre. 
  "We collect all the evidence. We receive evidence from the 
hospitals, such as death certificates, if there are any. We 
obtained documents from the mukhtar, and visited the homes of 
the dead," Attorney 'Abd-al-Ghani al-'Awawi said. "The same 
procedure applies to the wounded." 
  The East Jerusalem Waqf handed over to the committee a file 
of its correspondence with the Defense Ministry containing 
hundreds of complaints about abuse of Muslim worshipers by 
Jewish settlers in the Cave of the Patriarchs. Attorney 
al-'Awawi said that the committee will examine testimonies and 
the security arrangements and procedures in the cave. "We 
question the guards and the other workers, and anyone who was in 
touch with the Israeli authorities on issue pertaining to the 
cave." 
  There is almost not a single committee members whose clan or 
close family does not have a casualty of the Hebron massacre. 
The daily reality of Hebron adds tension to the already tense 
inquiry. The committee members move between hospitals, mourning 
families, houses of the wounded and eye witnesses. Being under 
curfew, movement around Hebron includes undergoing checks at IDF 
roadblocks or the chance of encountering a violent clash. 
  Since the murder, support for the PLO reached an 
unprecedented low in Hebron. The street is not too anxious to 
cooperate with a committee associated with Fatah. In the middle 
of last week, the committee attempted to shake off any marker 
that would associate it with Fatah or any other organization. 
Until last Tuesday, the committee sat in the Academics 
Association building. On Wednesday, it moved to offices hired 
for its purposes. 
  Attorney Husayn al-Shayukhi, one of 'Arafat's associates in 
Hebron, was not pleased with the establishment of the committee: 
"'Arafat's advisers misled him by advising to establish a 
Hebron commission of inquiry. The Cave of the Patriarchs is 
sacred to all Arabs and Muslims, not only the Hebron residents. 
Therefore, there was a need to establish an international 
committee; or at least an Arab or Muslim committee. If this was 
impossible, a committee that includes members from throughout 
the territories should have been set up. It should have 
included representatives of all movements, including the 
Islamic. And, in general, a committee should not have been 
established at all because it lacks authority." 
  Last week, before the PLO committee was set up, another 
Palestinian committee began investigating the incident. It was 
appointed by the Supreme Muslim Council in Jerusalem. It is 
headed by the Hebron religious court judge Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Muktasib. It includes notables identified with the PLO 
opposition, such as Shaykh Taysir Bayyud al-Tamimi, and Dr. 
'Aziz Duwayk, both of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], and 
'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Natshah, who is considered affiliated 
with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
  This committee is conducting an investigation of its own. 
Being part of the religious establishment, its members 
approached the Civil Administration, through the East Jerusalem 
Waqf, asking for permission to enter the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
The have been rejected so far. Shaykh al-Tamimi, who is 
normally in charge of the cave, fears that Israel is using the 
massacre to change the complex. "We have testimonies that Israel 
has brought building materials into the cave. We will not agree 
to any changes in the complex, certainly not to erecting walls 
inside the cave." 
  Another committee set up in Hebron is made of family members 
of the murdered. European and Arab organizations and 
institutions have announced their willingness to financially 
support the victims' families. Israel also announced it will 
compensate them. The families are afraid that the some of the 
money will be lost on its way to Hebron. They decided that any 
contribution made will be presented only through the families' 
committee, or through the Hebron charity foundation, controlled 
by Hamas. 
  The family members are not interested in any of the 
commissions of inquiry. "We paid the price," they say, "and the 
committees will not bring our loved ones back." 
  The Hebron youths also showed no interest in the work of the 
committees. "Revenge -- this is the conclusion of our 
commission of inquiry. Nothing but revenge."

<F P=106> [Report by defense affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Justice Ministry rejects the possibility of 
extraditing Rami Dotan or Attorney Harold Katz to the United 
States if they are convicted by a U.S. court on the basis of the 
charges submitted against them in Ohio at the end of last week. 
  Justice Ministry spokesman Eti Asher explained yesterday 
that 
"Israeli law does not permit the extradition of Israeli citizens 
to foreign countries, even for extraditable offenses. That is 
the reason the United States has not submitted any request for 
the extradition of Rami Dotan and Attorney Harold Katz." 
[passage omitted] 
  Asher added that the United States could request Israel's 
permission to initiate Israeli court proceedings against the men 
named in the charge sheets, if they are indeed convicted by the 
U.S. courts, but it has yet to do so. The United States can 
also demand their extradition from any third country they may 
visit or in which they may reside. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The northern border has been quiet in the 24 hours 
since yesterday's clashes in south Lebanon. Defense 
establishment sources now say that the Syrians are directly 
connected to yesterday's attack in which two Nahal Brigade 
soldiers were killed. Our military correspondent Yariv 
Ben-Yehuda reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-Yehuda] There is a direct link 
between the Syrians and the Iranians on the one hand and 
yesterday's events and the Hizballah attacks on the other Deputy 
Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur stated today. Both countries 
support Hizballah and have some sort of hidden competition going 
on between them as to who will extend it more support in weapons 
and other areas. 
  [Gur] There is no doubt whatsoever that there is a direct 
link between the Syrians and Hizballah. We have had countless 
evidence that if the Syrians wish it, Hizballah will hold its 
fire. One cannot say they are the sole influence on Hizballah 
since the Iranians also have a say there, but there is no 
question that the Syrians have a great deal of influence over 
Hizballah's actions. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] Hizballah has been showing signs of having 
regained its strength since Operation Accountability. Deputy 
Minister Gur said Hizballah has improved its method of operation 
and has recently acquired sophisticated weapons. 
  [Gur] Hizballah's ability is quite considerable. In the 
past year it acquired modern and sophisticated weapons. It has 
also adopted a more sophisticated method of operation. 
Therefore, its ability to operate can not be dismissed. This 
necessitates us being constantly on alert and thinking of ways 
to overcome these new factors. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] Gur was visiting Eti Kohen, the woman wounded 
in yesterday's terrorist attack near the settlement of 'Ateret. 
He added that it is not yet clear what additional waves of 
terror are to be expected in the wake of the massacre in Hebron. 
He went on to say that there are currently large numbers of 
troops in the field and that the security forces have been 
adopting numerous and diverse measures to guarantee maximum 
security. [end recording]

  [Text] A terrorist has been seriously wounded by Border 
Police gunfire in the Gaza Strip. Our correspondent Moti Amir 
reports that shots were fired at a Border Police patrol from a 
passing car. The policemen were unharmed and returned the fire. 
The terrorists fled in a car. Later, one of them arrived with 
serious wounds at a Gaza hospital and was arrested. 
  An Israeli citizen sustained serious head injuries when 
stones were hurled at him in central Ramallah. He fled to an 
adjacent cafe where Arab patrons who tried to protect him were 
also attacked. The man barely managed to escape to a police 
station in Ramallah. His car was torched.

  [Text] At least 16 Palestinians have been wounded during 
disturbances today in the territories, nine in Qalqilyah, five 
in the Gaza Strip, and two in Bethlehem. In Hebron, a protest 
rally was staged against the curfew on the town and the massacre 
at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Although there were some clashes 
in the morning, later in the day the Israeli security forces 
refrained from intervening. 
  A 28-year-old blind Palestinian from Gaza has died in 
hospital from wounds after being shot, reportedly in error, by 
the Border Police. The man, Ahmad Ali, who came from the 
al-Shaja'iyah neighborhood, apparently got caught up in an 
exchange of fire when gunmen attacked the Border Police.

  [Text] Here is a special news report following a terrorist 
attack in the Binyamin area. There was a shooting attack near 
the settlement of 'Ateret. According to initial reports, two 
Egged bus passengers were seriously injured. Our correspondent 
in the territories Golan Yokhpaz reports from the studio: 
  There was a shooting attack near the settlement of 'Ateret, 
which is situated north of Jerusalem. Apparently two Israelis 
were seriously injured and three others were also wounded, 
although their condition remains unclear. The Israelis were hit 
by gunfire directed at an Egged No. 468 bus which drove by the 
settlement of 'Ateret in the Binyamin area on the Bi'r Zayt 
bypass. The bus, was travelling from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and 
picking up passengers from settlements in the Binyamin area. 
Seven Israeli ambulances are currently racing to the scene in 
order to evacuate the wounded, apparently to Hadassah-'En Kerem 
Hospital in Jerusalem. Large Army forces are also making their 
way to the scene of the attack in order to treat the wounded and 
close off the site. 
  We have just received an update on the condition of the 
wounded: Five are currently receiving first aid at the scene and 
initial reports indicate that two of the wounded are in serious 
condition and will soon be evacuated to hospital.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United Nations Collects the Toll"] </F>
  [Text] If the peace process starts moving again at this 
time -- first with the Palestinians, and later with Syria, 
Lebanon, and Jordan -- the development, desirable as it may be, 
will be taking place in the shadow of the UN Security Council 
[UNSC] resolution, which Israel will find hard to digest. From 
the very first moment, it was clear that the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre would result in a harsh condemnation of 
Israel. Any American effort to prevent more painful damage was 
doomed to fail. The UNSC resolution portrays Israel as a 
country unable to provide security for the Palestinian residents 
of the occupied territories by itself. Therefore, the United 
Nations demands that Israel host an international observer force 
which would supervise the Israeli military government. The fact 
that Jerusalem was mentioned as part of the occupied territories 
reinforces the United Nations' refusal to recognize the 
undivided city as Israel's capital. 
  The U.S. policymakers tried to prevent such a resolution; 
but 
other than blocking a demand that the international observer 
force be armed, it scored no substantive achievement. The 
procedural achievement -- holding a clause-by-clause vote -- 
only allowed the Americans to express their reservations over 
the mention of Jerusalem. But the pressure AIPAC [American 
Israel Public Affairs Committee] put on the U.S. Administration 
to order its UN representative to veto the entire resolution did 
not succeed. Clinton and Christopher can tell American Jewry 
that they did their best to soften the blow to Israel, but the 
scope of the Hebron disaster reduced their ability to do so. 
  The government certainly entertains no illusions about the 
gravity of the U.S. failure -- which is its own failure as well. 
At the same time, it is trying to find consolation in the fact 
that the UNSC resolution could pave the way for the resumption 
of contacts with the other peace process partners. 
Nevertheless, any Israeli attempt to diminish the impact of the 
resolution -- for example, restricting the number of observers 
to a certain minimum -- might be dependent on concessions we 
will have to make in the direct negotiations with the PLO 
delegation. 
  Naturally, the fact that the PLO leadership agreed to 
receive 
the Israeli delegation and hold discussions with it, which means 
the resumption of the negotiations about an early withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho, is welcome. At the same time, Rabin will 
apparently have to agree that the Tunis discussions will also 
deal with the means that need to be employed to protect the 
Palestinians. The qualification made last week, according to 
which the issue will be discussed "in accordance with the 
government's resolution," should not mislead us. We had better 
not act surprised when the PLO, on whose territory the 
discussions are being held, demands that all the Jewish settlers 
be evacuated from Hebron. 
  Even if the government wishes to hold on to Qiryat Arba' for 
the time being, there is no reason to expect that it will 
succeed in holding on to the Jewish settlement inside Hebron by 
concentrating the settlers in one or two sites instead of the 
current seven. Had the government pulled them out immediately 
after the massacre -- risking petitions to the High Court of 
Justice and braving the opposition -- Israel could have suffered 
less damage at the UNSC. At this time, there is serious doubt 
whether the government will be able to avoid making the move it 
had hoped to avoid while leaning on the United States. The 
right-wing parties have no reason to claim that their 
demonstrations influenced the government. The fact that the 
belief that Israel would be able to avoid paying a price for the 
Hebron massacre was mistaken is now clearly visible to all.

  [Text] The newspaper AL-SAFIR has reported that the 
security forces arrested a fugitive suspect involved in blowing 
up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in al-Zuq. This brings the 
number of detainees who have confessed to participating in the 
crime to five, including a monk. A search is under way for six 
fugitive suspects, including the official in charge of the 
operation, who escaped to the occupied border zone. 
  AL-SAFIR adds that the detainees confessed to receiving 
their 
orders from two officers in the Mosad, the Israeli intelligence 
service. Investigations continue to determine how much the 
organizations to which the detainees belong know about the 
operation. According to AL-SAFIR, the official in charge of the 
operation is Pierre 'Ayn, a demolition expert who worked as an 
aide to a former Lebanese Forces official and who escaped to the 
occupied border zone along with two of his assistants.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Samir Ja'ja', commander of the </F>
Lebanese Forces, by correspondent Ahmad Birru in the studio; 
date and place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Ja'ja'] It is regrettable that the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church bombing should be exploited in an attempt to 
outdo us in our continuous defense of society for the past 15 
years in which we offered thousands of martyrs for this purpose. 
Many lightning strikes against the Lebanese Forces have been 
launched. Dozens of persons from these forces were arrested and 
all of them have subsequently been released. The Lebanese 
Forces' positions are always open and the Army has inspected 
them more than once. Finally, we were surprised to learn that 
these centers have been confiscated. The given excuses and 
rationale cannot be justified. I understand that the judicial 
sources can level charges and convict people. However, I do not 
know who accused the Lebanese Forces. Who are they? There have 
been leaks to the press and rumors to the media. We can see 
everything except a judicial investigation, which we should see. 
Ten days have passed so far since a number of measures and 
arrangements began which they said are security measures to 
uncover the perpetrators of the Sayyidat al-Najat massacre. But 
we have not seen anything tangible expect dark, clouds and 
repression measures that are being taken under the excuse of 
searching for the Sayyidat al-Najat attackers. 
  We were the first to demand uncovering those who carried out 
the church bombing. But what is happening today is a case of 
political repression of the Lebanese Forces. 
  [Birru] They say that at least three of the six suspects 
have 
been connected with or have confessed -- the investigation 
continues -- that they have something to do with the issue. 
Even the president has hinted that the investigations are about 
to uncover the suspects. Three of them belong to or frequent 
the Lebanese Forces centers and it is said that they left for 
the occupied border strip and from there to Israel and then to 
Europe and they returned to Kasrawan from Europe. 
  [Ja'ja'] This is our hope. We wish to see three persons 
admit that they placed the bomb. All the Lebanese people want 
this. But where are these three people? What are their names? 
Let them appear before the court. Who is doing the 
investigation? I do not know. Where are they? I do not know. 
What are their names? Nobody knows. As for the excuse that 
they visited the Lebanese Forces centers, any criminal can visit 
anywhere. If someone visits you and commits a murder two days 
later, this does not mean that you are also a criminal, that all 
fingers should be pointed at you, and that you should be 
accused. I categorically reject any charges against the 
Lebanese Forces as an establishment. Moreover, we would like 
the judiciary to carry out its responsibility and carry out its 
legal measures. Otherwise what is the law for? 
  Three, five, six, or 10 made confessions. Great. Let us 
uncover them and let the trial start so we know what is going 
on. Regrettably, the atmosphere is foggy and no one knows what 
is going on. There are a pack of rumors sometimes against the 
Lebanese Forces, sometimes against monks, and sometimes other 
groups. This is no investigation. 
  [Birru] The investigation is ongoing and the judiciary is 
continuing its work. Do you trust the Lebanese investigation 
and judiciary. 
  [Ja'ja'] I have every confidence in the Lebanese judiciary. 
Since the investigation is still continuing, how can some state 
circles accuse this or that person, this or that side? Let us 
finish the investigation first and let us leave the case to the 
judiciary and then we will all support the law. 
  [Birru] Let us return to your relations with the regime, the 
state figures, the prime minister, the president, and the 
political parties taking part in the government. How are these 
relations now? 
  [Ja'ja'] If you please, before discussing these relations 
now, I have a brief explanation of what is going on against the 
Lebanese Forces. We all remember that following the Sayyidat 
al-Najat blast, the commander of the Lebanese Forces held a news 
conference in which he held the state responsible for the 
explosion and for any disturbance that might occur in the 
country. In my view what is going on now is that some of them 
want to get even by accusing the Lebanese Forces, and hence 
antagonizing the Lebanese Forces without anything and without 
any proof, before the investigation is completed and before the 
case is turned over to the Lebanese judiciary. 
  We regret this and we are complaining about it. For the past 
ten days, immense security measures have been inacted against 
the Ghidras centers. The Lebanese Forces centers have all been 
stormed and inspected, which is natural. But finally they were 
either occupied or confiscated under the pretext that they have 
a link. I understand that a person may have a link with an 
explosion or a security disturbance but for a building to have 
connection and to be arrested, this I do not understand. 
  With regard to your second question on our relations with 
senior state figures, and political parties in Lebanon, you are 
well aware that we were at the forefront of those who promoted 
the march of national reconciliation. Similarly, we will be the 
last to abandon this march. Consequently, we pursue dialogue as 
our basic approach in political action. Our relations with 
most, if not all, state figures are good. Concerning politics, 
we, at present, deem ourselves part of the political opposition. 
This means that we do not approve of anything done by state 
officials at present. We believe that there are many loopholes 
that need to be plugged. We also believe that we can do more to 
build a stronger Lebanon that can better shoulder its 
responsibilities. 
  [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': You, just like other Lebanese 
leaders, have recently gone to Syria to offer your condolences 
on the death of Staff Major Basil al-Asad. This apparently 
means that Samir Ja'ja' is maintaining ties with Damascus. What 
is the nature of these ties at present? 
  [Ja'ja'] There have always been ties between the Lebanese 
Forces and Damascus. Despite the difficult circumstances they 
have experienced, these ties have never been severed. These 
ties are still there. The visit I have made to Syria to offer 
my condolences on the regrettable incident that took place in 
Damascus is the least I could do. 
  [Birru] Are you critical of the Syrian role in aiding the 
Lebanese regime, or of the Syrian-Lebanese ties? 
  [Ja'ja'] We support whatever strengthens the Lebanese state. 
We support whatever contributes to the creation of a free and 
strong Lebanese state that is capable of shouldering its 
responsibilities, and ensuring for the Lebanese citizens their 
dignity, sovereignty, freedom, and livelihood. However, what 
has been taking place over the past two days does not speak well 
for the good conduct of some state institutions. That is why we 
hoped the officials holding constitutional posts would shoulder 
their responsibilities to correct the current mistakes. We 
believe that what is taking place constitutes a total repression 
of political freedoms. This hurts Lebanon. We hope that this 
repression will cease, and that the culprits who planted the 
bomb at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church will be uncovered. It is 
the true culprits of this blast who should be uncovered. We 
should not use the Sayyidat al-Najat Church blast as a cover to 
apply political pressure on a certain party. The culprits of 
this blast must be uncovered, and the necessary security 
precautions must be taken to protect the Lebanese people from 
all mischief. 
  [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': General Michel 'Awn, a previous 
rival, has recently spoken about the situation in Lebanon, 
criticizing the state. He has also talked about a federation 
between the Christians and Muslims in Lebanon. Do you share 
with him the view regarding the need to reconsider the 
territorial and political equation in Lebanon. 
  [Ja'ja'] You have said that Gen. Michel 'Awn is the 
archrival 
of the Lebanese Forces. He was our archrival four years ago. 
Why do you insist that he is still our archrival at present? 
Maybe, he is still the Lebanese Forces' rival. Maybe, he is no 
longer the archrival of the Lebanese Forces. 
  [Birru, laughing] He is known as the archrival of the 
Lebanese Forces. 
  [Ja'ja'] He wants to be seen as such. However, the Lebanese 
Forces do not want to be seen as rivals of any party. With 
regard to the issue of launching political plans, this is an 
open field for everyone. Each and every political party in 
Lebanon has the right to launch any political plan it deems fit, 
as long as dialogue is the approach pursued, and as long as the 
aim is to reach understanding. Each and every political party 
has the right to raise any political plan at the negotiating 
table. All other parties have the right to discuss this 
political plan. This is my comment on this issue. 
  [Birru] Do you still raise the proposal of forming a 
federation between Christians and Muslims in Lebanon? 
  [Ja'ja'] Our attitude toward this issue is well known. We 
believe that the Lebanese parties must hold constant 
consultations among themselves to reach the best possible 
situation. We believe that the paramount concern is to ensure 
the unity of Lebanon. Other issues are details that can be 
discussed among all Lebanese parties. It goes without saying 
that some of the proposals regarding details, or minor issues, 
are better than others. We acknowledge this. 
  [Birru] To the best of my knowledge, municipal elections 
will 
be held one year from now. It is public knowledge that you 
boycotted parliamentary elections for obvious reasons. Will you 
take part in the next municipal elections? 
  [Ja'ja'] This is the third time municipal elections have 
been 
postponed. I have serious doubts that officials are serious in 
their efforts to hold municipal elections. All of us know that 
1995 will be the year of presidential elections. Consequently, 
one can predict what officials will say then. They will say 
that 1995 is the year of presidential elections. Hence, 
municipal elections must be postponed, they will argue. 
Similarly, in 1996, they will say that 1996 is the year of 
parliamentary elections. Hence, they will postpone municipal 
elections. The same scenario will be repeated. 
  [Birru] Dr. Samir Ja'ja': Thank you. 
  [Ja'ja'] You are most welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, </F>
originally broadcast by the Voice of Faith in Islam radio 
station, by moderator Shafiq al-Musawi, Qasim al-Qasir, and 
other unidentified correspondents; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] In the past few years the world 
has witnessed major international and regional developments, 
including the fall of the USSR, the reappearance of nationalism, 
ethnic conflicts, the new world order slogan, and U.S. world 
dominance. The most notable theory to describe this change was 
that of U.S. thinker [Francis] Fukuyama, who said that "the 
world is witnessing the end of history through the triumph of 
Western liberal capitalism and its social, intellectual, and 
political values and the collapse of communist and Muslim 
ideologies." 
  Your eminence, after the collapse of the USSR some people 
said it was the end of history. How do you assess such 
international theories? Where does Islam stand on this? Where 
do the Islamic movements stand? 
  [Nasrallah] He who proposes the theory that we are 
approaching the end of history and considers the failure of the 
communist experiment in the USSR a victory for liberalism and 
capitalism is free to do so from his own perspective. However, 
when we assess these developments objectively, or at least from 
our own perspective, we reach a different conclusion. We agree 
with this theory as far as it means an end of history in one 
particular aspect. We disagree on the rest. If there were only 
two ideologies in the world, leaving no room for a third 
ideology, we might regard the collapse of one as a victory for 
the other. However, in the presence of other international 
ideologies professing to be able to build a civilization, the 
failure of the USSR's communist experiment does not necessarily 
signify a triumph of capitalist philosophy. The Islamists also 
consider, from their perspective, that the Soviet failure is a 
triumph for Islam and Islamic ideology. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] You have pointed out that the USSR's 
collapse 
was a common victory for Islam and capitalism, if one may so 
describe it. Nevertheless, what distinguishes Western society 
is the issue of liberties and human rights. A major erroneous 
belief to which some people adhere is that the Islamists fail 
the liberty test. It is said that the Islamists, unlike 
Westerners, oppress others. The Salman Rushdie issue and the 
killing in Algeria are seen as major difficulties for Islamists 
in connection with liberties. What is your opinion? 
  [Nasrallah] To give a relativist answer to this question, we 
must divide it into two parts. The first deals with the West's 
presumed military power and strong position on human rights, 
liberties, and similar matters. The second part is connected 
with the Western accusation that the Islamists will abolish 
liberties and leave no room for an alternative opinions if they 
come to power. 
  Regarding the first part of the question, I certainly do not 
acknowledge that the West is strong on the human rights issue. 
When it speaks of human rights, it is referring more to slogans 
than to facts. Liberties have no intrinsic value to the West 
but are merely slogans and arguments exploited for the 
furtherance of the Western countries' major interests. To use 
an example, the West is rallying behind Salman Rushdie under the 
slogan of human rights but at the same time is willing to 
slaughter an entire nation if it stands up and demands 
self-determination, which is, after all, a very basic human 
right. [passage omitted] 
  Let us move to the second part of the question: Western 
power today is not intellectual but political, military, and 
economic power. Even this power is now buffeted by crises. 
Theoretically, any Islamist can simply stand up and declare 
that Islam is the religion of liberties, that it allows freedom 
of worship, and that it opposes compulsion in religion. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Do you think other governments in the Arab 
and Islamic world will deal with the Islamists in the way the 
governments of Egypt and Algeria are now dealing with their 
Islamists? Will our turn come in Lebanon? Should we draw a 
conclusion from the Airport Bridge massacre [reference to 
Lebanese Army's shooting of several Hizballah demonstrators on 
13 September 1993]? What is your opinion? 
  Will the Islamists, in case they come to power, allow any 
other group to try to change Islamic rule by democratic means, 
or are we going to then say: This is God's government and none 
may go against it? 
  [Nasrallah] The prevailing phenomenon in the Islamic world 
today is the suppression of Islamists. Egypt and Algeria are 
constantly in the news because the authorities there have failed 
to destroy the Islamic movement. Very ugly repression is 
occurring in other Islamic countries as well. In some of them, 
such as Tunisia and Iraq, the Islamists are oppressed almost to 
an unimaginable degree. Merely belonging to a certain party in 
those countries is enough to earn one the death penalty. In the 
Arab Maghreb the Islamists are brutally suppressed. In some 
countries the Islamists have remained steadfast, in others they 
have weakened. In what direction will we move in Lebanon? We 
cannot give definite answers. Of course, the United States does 
not want to suppress all voices in Lebanon; it wants all 
pro-Israeli and pro-U.S. voices to be strengthened and given all 
kinds of freedom. It seeks to deny Lebanon's option to be a 
part of this nation. [passage omitted] 
  Are we about to face suppression? Judging by the rulers' 
mentality, I say yes; but taking into account the Lebanese 
people's demographic makeup and enlightenment, I say it will not 
be easy for the rulers to do this. 
  [Correspondent] Will the Islamists allow, in a Western-like 
democratic spirit, their opponents to try to bring down an 
Islamic government in a democratic election? Will the Islamists 
accept this? 
  [Nasrallah] If some forces can persuade a nation that an 
Islamic government is not worthwhile, then I do not believe that 
such a government can stay in power. A minority cannot impose 
an Islamic government on the majority. This is corroborated by 
historical events, except in those cases when the opposition to 
Islamic governments was corrupt and bolstered by force of arms. 
You spoke about your theory that Islamic thought might triumph 
in fact and theory at the end of history. Alternatively, we can 
see that many Islamic governments rose and fell throughout 
history, meaning that they were not the ultimate theoretical and 
practical solution for those societies. In the past, 
circumstances were different; even the Islamic governments that 
were established did not attain the level that we judge to be 
the proper level of Islamic rule. To use a specific example: 
When 'Ali [Bin-Abu-Talib, the fourth caliph] was martyred and a 
peace treaty was concluded between his son Hasan and Mu'awiyah 
[Bin-Abu-Sufayn, the fifth caliph and first Umayyad ruler], 
government in the Islamic lands was transformed into an 
autocratic, hereditary, and tribal rule. Islam was not part of 
that government. We do not allow anyone to judge Islam by the 
example of the Umayyads, the Abbasids, and all those who came 
after them. We cannot regard them as examples of Islamic 
government. In the troubled past, weak governments arose. 
Today there is an Islamic state with a great government. It is 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was not established by a 
triumphant family or tribe but by a nation of 40 million. They 
are 60 million now. This is an Islamic state that can serve as 
a foundation and pillar of world Islamism. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Perhaps a major cause of our society's 
backwardness and weakness lies in the socioeconomic factor. 
This problem persists, although Islamic writers have for dozens 
of years been writing books and delivering lectures on the 
applicability of Islam as a solution to this problem, 
particularly as Islam is concerned with social matters. When 
faced with realities, some Islamic movements have failed to 
offer economic and social remedies. Despite the reassurances we 
hear about the situation in Iran, countries established on 
Islamic lines have not succeeded in extracting themselves from 
the turmoil of the international economy. Iran is not sure 
whether to adopt a centralized or a market economy and is 
directly or indirectly subject to the dictates of the 
international market. It faces numerous economic problems and 
deals with usurer banks. Where are the Islamic economic 
projects that can deal with these problems? How can these 
problems be solved? 
  [Nasrallah] We must give the Islamic experiment a chance to 
prove itself before we judge. So far it has not had such a 
chance. Sudan has been subjected to attrition in the south since 
Islamic rule was established there. Furthermore, the Islamic 
movement inherited a very poor Sudan that continues to face 
embargoes and constant pressures. Therefore, we cannot say that 
its economic experiment has failed because it has not yet had an 
economic experiment. The Sudanese people are still trying to 
catch their breath and assert themselves despite the crises that 
are constantly created for them. 
  As to the Islamic Republic of Iran, a new well-planned 
policy 
was pursued after the eight-year war. During the war years, the 
Iranian economy basically sought to prevent the country's 
collapse and for this reason it was geared to development, 
services, and consumption. Some development projects were 
specifically established to offer quick services to the people 
to enable them to face the war conditions. After the war ended, 
the Iranian Government had an important chance to install a new 
economic experiment. [passage omitted] 
  Islam outlines general economic principles and guidelines, 
leaving specific programs and detailed plans for the nation's 
leadership. The Islamic government in Iran faithfully adheres 
to these principles and is looking for the proper plan to 
establish a vibrant economy, drawing on the lessons it learned 
from the country's problems and taking possible future dangers 
into account. It is seeking a strong economy that will fulfill 
the standards of social justice, liberty, and property. In this 
context, it had a first five-year plan and a second five-year 
plan. The latter is now bearing fruit. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Peace Through Deeds," the 
newspaper TISHRIN writes: Time should not be wasted now that 
Shim'on Peres has stated that Israel is interested in activating 
the talks with Syria as a means of achieving a comprehensive 
settlement with the Arabs, and now that Yitzhaq Rabin has stated 
that it is time to hold serious negotiations and make painful 
decisions. 
  TISHRIN adds: The questions insistently posed by observers 
is: Has Israel learned any lessons from the terrible Hebron 
massacre? Has Israel actually abandoned the policy of trickery 
and procrastination, which it has pursued since the Madrid 
conference, in order to join serious negotiations in search of a 
lasting and firm peace? 
  TISHRIN continues: So far, there has been nothing tangible 
to suggest a real change in the Israeli position on the peace 
process with Syria and other Arab parties. Israeli officials 
were content to give hints, which are shrouded in ambiguity and 
obscurity, at a time when Syria is talking clearly about full 
peace. 
  The paper stresses that full [Israeli] withdrawal is a basic 
condition for promoting the peace process and achieving a 
substantive breakthrough. The whole world knows that Syria 
cannot sell out a single inch of the Golan and that full Israeli 
withdrawal from these Syrian territories cannot be bargained 
over. 
  TISHRIN cautions that further Israeli trickery at the 
Washington talks will only waste both time and a rare 
opportunity to achieve a just, comprehensive, and firm peace in 
the region. The paper emphasizes that when Syria talks about 
the Golan it looks forward to achieving full Israeli withdrawal 
from all occupied territories. The paper urges the international 
community to assume its responsibility, confront Israel's 
aggressive character, and champion the international principles 
and charters. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is deeds, and not words, that 
count. Statements by Israeli officials are not significant 
unless they are translated to realities on the ground; that is, 
full Israeli withdrawal, recognition of Arab rights, compliance 
with the UN Security Council resolutions, and commitment to the 
principle of returning the territories.

  [Excerpts] His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al Khalifah, 
the amir of Bahrain, arrived in Damascus at 1130 today on a 
visit to the Syrian Arab Republic. President Hafiz al-Asad led 
those who received him at Damascus International Airport. Also 
present at the airplane ramp were Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam and Dr. Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime Minister 
Mahmud al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', and Bahrain's 
Ambassador in Damascus Muhammad Hamad al-Muhaymid. [passage 
omitted] 
  After a brief rest at the airport's VIP lounge, President 
Hafiz al-Asad and his important guest left in an official 
motorcade for Tishrin Palace, where his highness will reside. 
His Highness Shaykh 'Isa is accompanied by an official 
delegation, including Foreign Minister Shaykh Muhammad 
Bin-Mubarak, Interior Minister Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Khalifah Al 
Khalifah, Transportation Minister Shaykh 'Ali Bin-Khalifah Al 
Khalifah, Information Minister Tariq 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Mu'ayyad, 
Finance and National Economy Minister Ibrahim 'Abd-al-Karim 
Muhammad, Minister of Trade and Agriculture Habib Ahmad Qasim, 
and Amiri Court Chief Yusuf Rahmah al-Dusari. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa 
Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held a meeting in Tishrin Palace attended 
by the Bahraini delegation accompanying the amir. On the Syrian 
side, the meeting was attended by Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam and Muhammad Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime Minister Mahmud 
al-Zu'bi, Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar', Interior Minister Dr. 
Muhammad Harbah, Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman, 
Economy and Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, 
Presidential Affairs Minister Wahib Fadil, Agriculture Minister 
As'ad Mustafa, and Transportation Minister Dr. Radwan Martini. 
  In a statement to the media, Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Salman Al 
Khalifah said: It is my pleasure to be on this brotherly visit 
to the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic--the cradle of Arab 
civilization, the launching pad for pan-Arab awakening, and the 
rallying point for the Arabs--in order to meet with brother 
President Hafiz al-Asad whom we hold in deep respect and 
fondness for what his excellency enjoys in terms of pan-Arab 
devotion and a farsighted vision of current Arab and 
international developments. This is in addition to his 
honorable and firm principled stands on pan-Arab issues and 
toward all Arab brothers in the big Arab Homeland. 
  It is also my pleasure to express during this visit the deep 
feelings of love and solidarity the government and people of 
Bahrain have toward the fraternal Syrian people and their 
national government. Our fraternal countries met, each from 
their vital position in the Arab world, on the road to national 
commitment and adherence to the joint interests of our Arab 
nation in terms of its awakening and building. Syria has played 
a distinguished Arab role since the beginning of the process by 
spreading enlightened Arab awareness, entrenching the values of 
Arab civilization and culture, standing in solidarity with our 
fraternal Arab brothers at various stages and against all 
challenges. 
  Fraternal Syria's stand during the October 1973 war, 
championing the Arab right to Palestine and the Arab territories 
had a great impact in creating an effective Arab consensus. We 
are now in real need for solidarity under the critical 
circumstances we are facing to confront the rapid challenges and 
developments in the region and around the world. We now 
reaffirm our full support for the comprehensive peace process 
based on pan-Arab constants and principles to which we, along 
with sisterly Syria and fraternal Arabs, adhere. We must 
reaffirm that in order to achieve stability and development for 
the people of the entire region, the peace process should be 
based on the principle of comprehensive and just peace. 
  Peace cannot pervail without restoring the territories. Land 
should be exchanged for peace. Based on this basic principle, 
we reaffirm that Bahrain supports Syria's demand for a full 
Israeli withdrawal from its occupied territories and its 
legitimate right to the full return of the occupied Syrian Golan 
to Syrian sovereignty without encroaching on its international 
borders under any claim whatsoever. 
  On another pan-Arab level, we must praise Syria's just stand 
on the issue of liberating Kuwait and returning it to its 
owners. In continuation of this positive stand, Syria's 
coordination with its sisterly states in the Gulf Cooperation 
Council and with Egypt within the framework of the Damascus 
declaration is the best formula to support the march of Arab 
cooperation. 
  In conclusion, we look forward to more steps toward 
coordination and cooperation between our two fraternal countries 
during this renewed brotherly meeting with brother President 
Hafiz al-Asad and his countrymen as a reinforcement of our 
distinguished and constructive brotherly relations. We believe 
that these relations are a positive and advanced model in the 
march of joint Arab action. An Arab greeting from Bahrain to the 
leadership and people of Syria, the stronghold of Arabism.

  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced his 
discomfort over the media's distortion of his stand on 
Jerusalem, which some sides interpreted as an approval of 
Israel's position that unified Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
  A U.S. State Department official told AL-ITTIHAD that the 
United States regrets such a distortion of President Clinton's 
position and stresses that the U.S. position on Jerusalem has 
not changed and that Clinton had announced that the status of 
Jerusalem would be decided during negotiations in accordance 
with the contents of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles.

<F P=106> [Interview with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih by Khayrallah </F>
Khayrallah "yesterday"; place not given] 
  [Text] [Khayrallah] You accuse Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leaders of deciding on separation. Who do you believe has taken 
this decision? 
  [Salih] Those who have decided on separation are known. 
They are the elements of apostasy and separation in the YSP. 
It is they who fabricated the crisis, escalated its regrettable 
complications, and took numerous separatist measures, including 
the circumvention of the results of the 27 April 1993 elections, 
the mobilization of citizens in southern and eastern 
governorates against unity, the rebellion against constitutional 
legitimacy and nonrecognition of constitutional institutions, 
mobilization of military units and their withdrawal from the 
political borders of the Republic of Yemen to the former 
partition border areas, and the fomenting of sedition and 
stirring up of sectarian, territorial, and tribal tendencies 
with a view to fomenting a sedition in society and pushing the 
Yemeni people into the furnaces of infighting. 
  [Khayrallah] Do you believe that separation is a reality? 
  [Salih] Regrettably the forces of apostasy and separation in 
the YSP have through their partitionist practices imposed the 
reality of undeclared separation in some southern and eastern 
governorates. It is obviously a reality which the Yemenis will 
never recognize. They will resist it with all their strength to 
safeguard unity. The sons of our people, especially in the 
southern and eastern governorates, have suffered a great deal 
from the calamities of partition. They vigorously refuse to 
return the Yemeni homeland to the situation that existed before 
the 22 May 1990. Because they understand the meaning of the 
return of the totalitarian regime's domination of people's life. 
Unity rescued them from a horrific nightmare and is an umbrella 
of security for the Yemeni people. Our people will not allow 
anyone or any party to claim guardianship over them and their 
unity. 
  The Yemeni people will defend and safeguard unity, whatever 
the price and the sacrifices. Separatists will gain nothing, 
nor will they achieve their narrow and selfish aims. The Yemeni 
people are now grown up. The sons of our Yemeni people in what 
used to be known as the south of the homeland moved out of the 
horrific prison and the iron fence imposed on them by the YSP 
over 25 years of totalitarian rule. No one in Yemen will ever 
accept a return to that prison at all. 
  [Khayrallah] What is the fate of the Pledge and Accord 
Document? 
  [Salih] The Pledge and Accord Document signed in Amman on 10 
Ramadan [20 February] is binding on everyone, ends the crisis, 
and imposes implementation. The Yemeni people will not accept 
its circumvention by any party. 
  The YSP leadership was supposed to return to Sanaa after the 
signing to merge the constitutional and executive institutions 
and form a coalition government headed by Haydar al-'Attas from 
the General People's Congress, the YSP, and the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, in order to carry out its duties and put the document 
into practice. But regrettably, some separatist forces in the 
YSP are seeking to circumvent the document because it affects 
their narrow interests. 
  [Khayrallah] Do you believe that some people are financing 
the separation? 
  [Salih] It is difficult to answer that question, for 
numerous reasons. However, it can be answered by another 
question: Where does the YSP get all that money to spend on 
purchasing and stockpiling arms in the former partition areas? 
How does it finance the armed militias and spending on the new 
military formations it is setting up outside the constitutional 
institutions? 
  Where do some of these separatist elements get the huge 
amount of cash from which they spend generously on buying 
people's consciences, kindling conflicts in society, and 
financing subversive operations in the homeland, especially in 
the northern governorates, to disrupt the security of the 
companies operating in the oilfield and kidnap foreigners to 
give the impression that there is no stability in northern 
governorates. We have sufficient evidence to prove that. Of 
course the YSP does not get these huge sums of money from the 
state treasury, so where does it get the money? Anyhow, our 
people know very well the sources of the YSP's finances. They 
are clear and exposed. 
  [Khayrallah] In your view, what are the real causes of the 
crisis? 
  [Salih] In brief: First, the crisis actually began on 12 
Dhu al-Hijjah 1411 Hegira, corresponding to 24 June 1991. 
  Second, there is the YSP leaders' nonrecognition of the 
results of the 27 April elections and the attempt to get around 
them by fabricating and escalating the crisis. 
  THird, there is the YSP's acceptance of constitutional 
reforms and then rejection of them because of its secretary 
general's disapproval. 
  Fourth, there is the discovery of oil in some southern and 
eastern governorates, which whetted some people's appetites and 
ambitions. Some people thought that they could sacrifice the 
gigantic project represented in the united state for a dwarf 
project represented in a petty oil state that fulfills personal 
and selfish wishes. 
  This is why the crisis was fabricated without taking account 
of the potential harm to the interests of the homeland and the 
people amd the potential serious threats to the march of unity 
and democracy. 
  [Khayrallah] At the beginning you maintained that there was 
no crisis, so what has changed to make you talk about a crisis? 
  [Salih] Indeed at the beginning of the crisis we tried to 
play down and contain the effects of the crisis and see it as 
merely contradictions and differing views that could be resolved 
through dialogue and reason. At the beginning it was indeed 
minor and lay primarily in the brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid's 
seclusion after his return to Aden from a hospitalization trip 
abroad on 19 August 1993. We had though that through dialogue, 
understanding, and mediation we would be able to persuade him to 
return to Sanaa to carry out his duties, as happened in the 
past. But it seems that what happened was deeper, more serious, 
and had been planned for some time to produce a crisis in the 
manner we are experiencing now and to push the country to the 
situation it is now in, in addition to the threats posed to 
unity and democracy in our country as a result.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Vice President 'Ali Salim al- Bid </F>
by Amin Muhammad Amin in Aden; date not given] 
  [Text] Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid has warned that 
there is a plan being implemented against the Arab nation to 
spread terrorism and extremism, undermine the Arab and Islamic 
nation's aspirations, and isolate it from the world. In an 
interview with AL-AHRAM, he said that this terrorist plan has 
clear features and is targeted against Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, 
Sudan, Yemen, and other Arab states. 
  Al-Bid called for confronting this plan by discussing it on 
a 
pan-Arab level. He also called for confronting the backward 
mentalities which want to impose their will on the Arab and 
Islamic nation. He welcomed any Arab effort to help Yemen avoid 
the specter of civil war, continue the democratic and peaceful 
march of unity, and adhere to the pledge and accord document. 
  Al-Bid renewed his call to President Mubarak and to eldest 
sister Egypt to play an influential role in the Yemeni arena, 
given Egypt's relations with Yemen and its past sacrifices for 
Yemen's sake. Egypt must play a pan-Arab role because there can 
be no strong Arab nation without it. This is what he proposed 
to President Mubarak during their recent contacts. He said: 
Our recent meeting with him was greatly reassuring because it 
showed that Egypt pays great attention to Yemen's problems. 
  Al-Bid said: We cannot allow Yemen to be a way station for 
exporting terrorism to Egypt because this hurts us and runs 
counter to our loyalty to Egypt. It is illogical for us to 
offer terrorism instead of loyalty. 
  On the situation in Yemen, al-Bid said that despite events 
he 
is optimistic and will remain optimistic about realizing the 
grand design of Yemeni unity, which was always an excuse for 
fraternal warfare. In the 1972 and 1979 skirmishes, we used to 
stop after battles and call for unity. In 1989, we called for a 
united Yemeni state with a peaceful spirit, a democratic basis, 
and with the logic of the modern age. However, a short time 
after the march of unity began we faced some obstacles. The 
most important thing was not to resort to fighting, especially 
as violence is not the road to unity but a completely different 
road. The road to unity is peaceful and democratic and is based 
on convictions and goals. Unity must not be exposed to farces 
and vituperations. 
  He explained that with time it turned out that the proper 
conditions and the proper leadership to accommodate the 
aspirations for unity and achieve a common vision and goal were 
lacking in Yemen. Al-Bid said that the existence of 
disagreements between the two leaderships in Yemeni, the fact 
that this subject in all its political dimensions was not 
submitted for discussion, and the fact that no attempt was made 
to pinpoint the mistakes and negative manifestations placed the 
unity plan in a predicament. This happened despite popular 
consensus on unity and determination by the various sincere sons 
of the Yemeni people to achieve it. Al-Bid said: During our 
short experience, we have discovered that a reactionary 
terrorist plan is being prepared against the Arab nation with a 
view to returning us to the Middle Ages and perhaps excluding 
us, as Arabs and Muslims, from the modern world. All the plots 
and sedition being concocted against the Arab nation are also 
directed at the Islamic nation. In Yemen we are suffering from 
this terrorist plan opposing unity. We discovered in time that 
there are several terrorist acts and assassinations aimed at 
jeopardizing the march of unity. Therefore, it was necessary to 
adopt a stand against terrorism and those who support it, to 
protect the Arab nation's unity and solidarity, and to find a 
logical formula to confront this plan. 
  The secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
said that the Gulf crisis was another factor that affected the 
unity of Yemen. 
  He wondered about the reasons for the success of some 
fundamentalist calls and terrorist acts. He said that this 
success is the result of the existence of basic unresolved 
problems in some societies. These terrorist elements exploit 
such situations. They also exploit the youths who are suffering 
from a moral void and the absence of a pan-Arab concept to cling 
to. He clarified that despite this, the fundamentalist formula 
advocating terrorism under the slogan of the true Islamic 
religion--which in fact has nothing to do with them--did not 
gather momentum by itself. The Afghan experiment does not apply 
in the Arab world. 
  He affirmed that the most important problem impeding a state 
of unity is the fact that a number of leaders have not quite 
assimilated this great pan-Arab development. This is why the 
document concentrates on establishing a unified state and its 
mechanism. Unfortunately, the search for a state that would 
subsume such competition and development in the various fields 
in these circumstances was unsuccessful during the transitional 
period. The situation then deteriorated into assassinations, 
explosions, and military confrontation instead of dialogue. 
  The Yemeni vice president then discussed the developments 
that took place after signing the Pledge and Accord Document in 
Aden [place as published]. He clarified that hours after the 
signing ceremony, clashes erupted between the Yemeni Army units, 
which was the first time this had happened on this scale and in 
this way. For the first time since unity, orders were issued to 
soldiers of the Yemeni Army to kill their own brothers in the 
Army. Despite this, I issued orders not to respond with 
violence in order to avoid the shedding of innocent Yemeni 
blood, because the victor in this kind of battle is the loser 
and such fighting would push Yemeni unity into a new dark 
tunnel. Fighting is not our method, because it kills unity. 
  This is why we adhere to the Pledge and Accord Document. But 
when we proposed the implementation of the first article in it, 
the reaction by the other side was to fight harder to silence us. 
  Al-Bid confirmed the need to try those accused of the recent 
assassinations in Yemen. He said: We all have to work hard to 
implement the agreement, which enjoys national consensus from 
the various groups of people. 
  At the same time, we need Arab efforts alongside the Yemeni 
efforts. 
  Al-Bid said that unfortunately we have encountered 
narrow-minded people who cannot think logically and try to take 
over the institutions. They were not up to the standard of the 
grand national project for unity. 
  Regarding the deadlock Yemeni unity is facing in 
implementing 
the Pledge and Accord Document as a result of the differences 
between the YSP, which is demanding that the defendants be 
arrested and the first article of the document be implemented, 
and the People's Congress, which is insisting on uniting the 
state institutions before anything else, 'Ali Salim al-Bid said 
that some people had believed that signing the document would 
end the crisis. This was wrong. The truth is that by signing 
the document we recognized that there was a crisis and 
established all the conditions for resolving it. The situation 
requires that we move toward implementation under the 
appropriate circumstances. 
  The document's seventh article calls for several security 
and constitutional guarantees that should have been annexed to 
the document. The prime minister, brother Haydar Abu-Bakr al- 
'Attas, made a lot of efforts over the past month to persuade 
the brothers in Sanaa to offer or implement security guarantees, 
but his efforts bore no fruit. In Amman we submitted a YSP 
paper that explained our views on how to implement the 
agreement, beginning with gradual normalization and following up 
with clear steps and maintaining the earnest drive to implement 
the accord. 
  The vice president explained: Wanted suspects were not 
pursued, the country became involved in a crisis, and we had to 
leave Sanaa. There were officials in the state's institutions 
protecting well-known criminals. When we feel that some 
officials are linked to killings, how can we feel safe? I want 
to say this frankly: Some people are opposed to the document, 
and for this reason I hesitated before signing it as I did not 
want to be hasty. I was afraid that the signing of the document 
would inflame the security situation; and this actually happened. 
  Regarding fears of a possible military confrontation, the 
vice president said these fears are real and the Military 
Committee must get help from the Arab countries. 
  He added: We support the expansion of Arab participation, 
particularly by our Egyptian brothers, and cooperation in 
bringing the views closer. We are seeking to avoid a civil war 
and to pursue our democratic process. If we are dragged into a 
conflict, this will bring destruction to Yemen. We call for the 
supremacy of law and demand an investigation into the serious 
events that have occurred to determine who was at fault. 
Despite our efforts four brigades have been mobilized in 
al-Bayda' in the north against one brigade in the south. 
  We draw comfort from the fact that the citizens are opposed 
to infighting. Furthermore it is difficult for any one party to 
control Yemen by way of killings and terrorism. Sit-ins and 
civil disobedience have begun in various areas. This happened 
after my call to the citizens to abide by the document. I 
expect popular support for the democratic process to grow until 
we are able to build one state. 
  Civil disobedience is a legitimate action, particularly 
because some officials are exploiting the state to promote their 
own personal interests. They are pointing the state in the 
wrong direction. Hence our only possible course of action is to 
go to the people and encourage democratic struggle. What is 
important is not to let the guns speak. 
  Al-Bid affirmed that it was his awareness of the existence 
of 
sizable oil reserves in the south that made him hasten to 
promote unity with the north. He declared that this resource 
must belong to a united Yemen, adding: We did our utmost to 
promote unity. Our reward was assassinations and threats. 
  Al-Bid concluded his remarks to AL-AHRAM by saying: Some 
al-Jihad members are in Yemen. I regret that some people are 
dealing with these terrorists and encouraging them. Details 
will become known in due time. This cooperation with the 
terrorists does not serve our cause or honor it. The main 
terrorist camp is found in Sa'dah in the north. The terrorists 
also began to assemble in the south but we are able to pursue 
these terrorists pockets and expose them. However, we find it 
totally unacceptable that the terrorists should enjoy the 
support of some people in power and some Army units. When they 
are left without official support, it will be easy to besiege 
them and get rid of them.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Kurayshan from Tunis] </F>
  [Text] Palestinian-Israeli meetings resumed in Tunis this 
morning. As is known, the Israeli delegation is led by Amnon 
Shahaq while the Palestinian delegation is made up of Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, Ahmad Quray', and Akram Haniyah. Yesterday, the two 
delegations held a meeting that was also attended by President 
Yasir 'Arafat and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh. 
  According to Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee 
member, the Israeli delegation did not present serious proposals 
on the safety of Palestinians in the occupied territories. What 
he proposed, Ghawshah said, did not meet the minimum 
requirements. This, he added, means practically emptying the 
Security Council Resolution [904] of its substance. 
  Speaking to our radio, the Palestinian official said the 
Israelis had, for example, proposed turning the International 
Red Cross representatives in the occupied territories into 
international observers, according to an Israeli concept of the 
way to implement the Security Council's call for a temporary 
international presence in the occupied territories. It seems 
that during its talks here in Tunis, the Israeli delegation 
showed no positive response to proposals by Norwegian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Larsen on the security measures that should be 
taken in the occupied territories as Yitzhaq Rabin promised in 
his telephone call with Yasir 'Arafat last Friday. 
  U.S. peace coordinator Dennis Ross is due in Tunis this 
afternoon. According to some sources, a quadrapartite meeting 
of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations as well as Ross and 
Larsen is expected to be held to help develop the Israeli 
proposals to protect the Palestinians. It will be according to 
these proposals that the Palestinian stand toward the resumption 
of negotiations will be determined.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Mar (MENA)--A responsible Egyptian source 
has stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are expected to sign the final 
measures for the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles in the coming few weeks in Cairo. The 
same source noted that early empowerment may also apply to the 
Hebron area, in addition to Gaza and Jericho, adding that a 
Palestinian police force will be permitted in Hebron and a 
Palestinian mayor will be appointed there. 
  The same source stressed that the recent outlawing of the 
Kakh and Kahana terrorist movements in Israel was a considerable 
gain by the Palestinian negotiators, noting that president 
'Arafat played all his cards with great skill during the 
negotiations that followed the recent massacre at the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libyan Constitutional Union"] </F>
  [Excerpt] London, AL-HAYAH -- AL-HAYAH has received a 
statement from Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Ghalbun, leader of the Libyan 
Constitutional Union, commenting on recent developments in the 
Libyan opposition, dwelling specifically on the breaking away of 
a group from the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (the 
main opposition faction) and the subsequent establishment of the 
Libyan Movement for Change and Reform. Bin-Ghalbun said: 
"Since that group broke away there have been voices calling for 
prudence and trying to dissuade this group from its plan under 
the pretext of unity, claiming that splits weaken the unity of 
ranks and serve the interests of the regime only. But that is 
untrue, because the split is prompted by the care for national 
interests and aimed at correcting and strengthening the moderate 
national line." He expressed his hope that "the new 
organization will become one of the active and strong Libyan 
organizations. I know some of the men responsible for its 
establishment, management, and guidance. They are capable of 
shouldering the responsibility and are experienced and 
knowledgeable and their national commitment and sincerity are 
above all suspicion." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The official spokesman of the government peace 
delegation to Nairobi, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, has said that the 
current peace talks in Nairobi opened amid encouraging signs, 
since all the negotiating parties are represented by high-level 
delegations. He said the presence of John Garang and Riak 
Machar would give impetus to the negotiations. 
  Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr. 
al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included 
African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were 
identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would 
help in resolving the southern problem. 
  Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official 
spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, 
said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours 
following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said 
so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to 
Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali 
al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD 
group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the 
Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for 
the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in 
Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali 
al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same 
people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London 
Forum under Baroness Cox. 
  He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the 
toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem 
should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to 
give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role, 
especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel 
leaders attending the talks for the first time.

  [Text] Israel is holding secret contacts with North Korea 
in a bid to prevent it from supplying Iran with long-range 
missiles. These contacts are being held against the wishes of 
the United States and contrary to Israel's promise to coordinate 
its relations with North Korea with the United States. Our 
political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  Several weeks ago, Israeli diplomats met with senior North 
Korean representatives in Beijing in the framework of secret 
contacts between the two countries. The contacts are designed 
to secure an agreement that would prevent North Korea from 
supplying Iran with Nodong missiles. These missiles, which have 
a range of 1,000 km, can carry chemical and nuclear warheads. 
In exchange, Israel is proposing to help raise approximately $1 
billion among U.S. Jewish businessmen for civilian projects in 
North Korea. 
  The contacts between the two countries are mainly 
coordinated 
by the Israeli Embassy in Beijing. The secret talks are being 
held against the wishes of the United States, which is currently 
conducting a campaign against North Korea in view of the 
latter's refusal to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  The Israeli-North Korean connection started approximately 
two 
years ago. One of the main mediators is an American Jewish 
businessman whose identity is being kept secret for fear that 
the U.S. authorities will harass him. Following preliminary 
contacts, Eytan Bentzur, deputy director general of the Foreign 
Ministry, left for North Korea among a group of geologists. 
Once there, he held secret meetings with North Korean 
officials. Bentzur prepared a visit by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres to North Korea, but at that point the United States 
intervened. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with 
Peres in Vienna and protested Israel's contacts with North 
Korea. Peres promised that all future contacts would be 
coordinated with the United States. 
  A senior political source in Jerusalem said the present 
contacts between Israel and North Korea are not necessarily 
being coordinated with the United States. We are dealing here 
with an Israeli security interest, and if we do not take care of 
it, nobody else will do it for us, the source claims.

  [Text] Investigations into the recent wave of bombings 
remain the focus of attention, particularly after emerging clues 
that point clearly to the party that stands behind them. This 
prompted the army command to take basic measures and to deploy 
units in this party's centers that were used for planning these 
bombings. 
  Visitors of President Ilyas al-Hirawi, citing him, told our 
radio that there were four detainees in the bombing of the 
Sayyidat al-Najat church, and that two others managed to flee to 
the occupied border strip. 
  THE NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY, quoting concerned parties, said 
that the results of the investigations into the bombing will be 
made public next week at a meeting at Justice Minister Bahij 
Tabbarah's office.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Rabin Is Maneuvering Anew," the 
newspaper AL-BA'TH writes: As part of Israel's policy of 
evading the requirments for peace--and whenever the 
international community tightens the grip on this policy of 
maneuvering and tampering with words--Israel makes statements on 
so-called concessions to this or that party. Rabin has talked a 
great deal about concessions in return for peace with Syria. He 
reiterated this notion of concessions after he returned from 
Washington, supposedly seeking to learn about the nature of 
peace that Syria wants. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Rabin's remarks are part of an attempt to 
search for a way out of his isolation. At the same time, these 
remarks are a mere semantical game, a much feigned desire for 
peace attempting to cover a strong adherence to occupation. The 
paper points out that anyone who talks about concessions should 
first possess legitimate property or a legitimate right to the 
thing he wants to relinquish. Rabin, as well as the former 
Israeli rulers, do not have any right whatsoever to the occupied 
Arab territories, and thus their alleged concessions are sheer 
falsehood. 
  The paper stresses that the territories are Arab lands with 
legitimate owners whose legitimate rights to these lands have 
been unanimously recognized by the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. The most important of these resolutions are the 
ones on which the peace process was established. Israel, 
however, is evading these resolutions by all ways and means. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Rabin is continuing his maneuvers 
and procrastination. This method, however, will not last long 
in view of the available opportunity for peace. This 
opportunity should achieve its objective.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistani Inflexibility"] </F>
  [Text] Why has Islamabad suddenly set its face against 
continuation of the Indo-Pakistan dialogue initiated by the 
Foreign Secretaries just two weeks ago? Two causes are 
indicated. The first is the compulsions of domestic politics. 
This factor has, of course, always had a decisive influence on 
the Pakistani stand on bilateral talks. But the latest brusque 
refusal to pick up the thread of the discussions between J.N. 
Dixit and Shahryar Khan, is a particularly striking instance. 
J.N. Dixit and Shaharyar Khan had themselves envisaged a 
resumption of the dialogue soon enough. This was the 
implication of the clear Indian offer to submit detailed 
proposals in search of common ground on Siachen and Sir Creek. 
This apart, Benazir Bhutto herself had given ample cause for the 
belief she was interested in an understanding on Siachen. Since 
then the climate in Pakistan has been anything but favourable 
for serious talks with India. 
  Nawaz Sharif has stepped up efforts to portray the PM [prime 
minister] as one who is inclined to do a deal with India on 
Kashmir. The Pakistani decision not to go ahead with a 
resolution in the UN General Assembly seeking to censure India 
for alleged human rights violations has especially drawn much 
flak in the Pakistani media as well as in the National Assembly. 
Other domestic difficulties, too, have somewhat weakened her 
position. Not the least of them has been her quarrels with her 
mother and brother both of whom seem to be determined to 
embarrass her in every possible way. If the upshot of all this 
has been to persuade her not to accord relations with India a 
high priority, it is a logical sequel. 
  Conceivably, the rigid tone of the Pakistan Foreign Office's 
statement ruling out a continuation of the bilateral dialogue -- 
reflected in the call to "finalise modalities" for a plebiscite 
in Kashmir -- may also mean a felt need for a review of all that 
has been done to hasten annexation of Kashmir. Pending the 
outcome of any such exercise, it is a common practice for 
Foreign Offices to reiterate fundamental positions on 
contentious issues with an air of finality. In purely rational 
terms, a thorough review should be a natural corollary to the 
failure of the frenetic campaign carried on by Pakistan abroad 
to compel India to concede Kashmir. In the last five years, 
Islamabad has left no stone unturned to convince the rest of the 
world that India is committing a genocide in Kashmir and that 
the only way of putting an end to it is for India to hand over 
the territory to Pakistan. But this has hardly had the desired 
impact. What then should be done? The policy-makers in 
Islamabad cannot possibly avoid asking themselves this question 
any longer. Further, Islamabad's tussle with pro-independence 
Kashmiri groups in Pakistan has intensified. All this adds up 
to a major challenge to both the security and foreign policy 
establishments in Islamabad. How they will cope with it is hard 
even to guess.

<F P=106> [Article by M.V. Kamath: "The Fate of Kashmiri Pandits"] </F>
  [Text] An international conference of Kashmiri Pandits was 
held in Delhi in the last week of December 1993 to focus the 
attention firstly of all Indians and secondly of the world 
beyond, on their present fate. And what is their fate? Their 
fate is to live as refugees in places outside the Vale of 
Kashmir which has been their ancestral home for centuries, in 
make-shift tents, braving the cold in winter and the searing 
heat in summer with no proper sanitary facilities and less 
medical attention. Organisations like Asia Watch while raising 
howls about the difficulties of Kashmiri Muslims, make no more 
than passing reference to the inhuman brutalities with which the 
Muslim terrorists have dealt with them. Over three lakh Kashmiri 
Pandits have been forced to flee their homes under threat of 
death. The terrorists have indulged in the rape of women and the 
killing of men in the best style of invading Muslim hordes of 
the Middle Ages. The latest incident is the shooting down of a 
hundred-year old Kashmiri Pandit in Wanpora in the first week of 
June 1993. In what way an aged man could have menaced Islam only 
the terrorists can tell. The Kashmir Government is silent on 
this as on other reckless murders. The Government of India is 
embarrassingly silent. Nobody wants to speak out lest their 
secular credentials are questioned by anyone. In 1941, according 
to census figures, Muslims formed 83 percent of the population 
of the Vale of Kashmir and Hindus 15 percent. In 1991 Muslims 
formed 97 percent of the population and Hindus 0.1 percent. 
Ethnic cleansing is complete. Aurangzeb would have been proud of 
the Muslim terrorists for the splendid work the latter have 
accomplished in the last four decades. According to a booklet 
published by the Kashmiri Samiti on human rights violation in 
Kashmir, the terrorist killings have been accompanied by torture 
unheard of in the annals of human history and includes 
strangulation by using steel wires, hanging, impaling, branding 
with red hot irons, burning alive, lynching, gouging of eyes 
before assassination, dismemberment of body, dragging to death 
and just plain slaughter. The booklet gives details including 
the names of those killed and the dates they were killed. The 
Government of India is free to challenge these facts and if they 
are untrue, this should be publicised. If they are true, we need 
an explanation. According to the booklet "the (Kashmiri) State 
Government is yet to disclose the identity of about 400 dead 
bodies recovered by the police and disposed of at its will". The 
booklet accuses the State Government of an attempt "to cover the 
anti-Hindu character of the terrorist violence and has tried to 
play down the massacre of Hindus". It is true that the 
terrorists have also killed Muslims not in their good books. 
Total civilians so far killed number 2,256 in five years 
(1988-1992) for which figures are available. The majority, of 
course, are Hindus -- Kashmiri Pandits. The unpleasant fact 
about Kashmir and its terrorist faction is that the crusade is 
to merge the State with Pakistan and drive every single Hindu 
out. Already the ethnic cleansing is almost complete. The brunt 
of hatred has been borne by the Kashmiri Pandits who have been 
denied elementary human rights. But to this date the fate of the 
Kashmiri Pandits is of no concern to anybody. 
  But let it be said clearly and precisely: Kashmir belongs to 
the Kashmiri Pandits, the original inhabitants of the state -- 
and NOT to the Muslims, just as Kuwait, or Oman or Bahrain which 
have non-Muslim majorities belong to the local Muslims because 
the latter are the original inhabitants of the areas. 
Islam came to India only in the 12th century. That a good number 
of the original Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam does not 
hide the fact that the background and the past of all 
Kashmiris is Hindu and should be recognised as such. The list of 
distinguished Kashmiri poets and scholars in Sanskrit from the 
Vedic period right on to the 12th century is long and 
impressive. The list tapers off following the advent of islam in 
the Vale. 
  To say that Kashmir is Muslim is a negation of history and a 
pandering to the whims of the neo-historians. Kashmir was, is 
and shall remain essentially Hindu and cannot be permitted to go 
into the hands of Pakistan for the last traces of Hinduism to be 
wiped out for ever. That is why the Kashmiris have been asking 
for a "homeland" of their own. That homeland can only be in 
Kashmir, not in Dandakaranya or somewhere in the wilds of Madhya 
Pradesh. And there is nothing fanciful in the demand of the 
Pandits. If Jews in their diaspora could dream and fight for a 
Jewish state two thousand years after they were dispersed in the 
four corners of Europe and get the support of modern states like 
Britain, France and United States and other smaller nations, 
there is no reason why the Kashmiri Pandits should not ask for a 
homeland here and now, while their status as refugees is 
temporary. There is an attempt made by our "intellectuals" to 
fob off the Kashmiri Pandits with false promises by saying that, 
why, of course, they could get back to their homes they were 
forced to vacate when the Kashmir issue is "settled". Nobody 
asks the question: Settled how? Or when? Or under what 
conditions? They are not consulted when the foreign secretaries 
of India and Pakistan discuss the so-called "Kashmir Question" 
as if their fate is of no moment. Aren't they entitled to know? 
Are they destined for ever to live as refugees at the mercy as 
much of a callous government as of a callous class of 
"intellectuals"? 
  There can be -- and there should be -- no Kashmir 
"settlement" without the guaranteed return of the Kashmiri 
Pandits to their ancestral homes. And even that is not enough. 
The State should guarantee that they will not be treated as 
second class citizens as has been the case these last four 
decades. They cannot be left to the tender mercies of 
ex-terrorists and their ilk. One can be sure that if Pakistan 
has its way, there will be no place for Kashmiri Pandits in 
Kashmir, which is their legitimate home. Under no circumstances 
should this be allowed to come to pass. Islamic terrorists 
should not be allowed to get away with murder. To support 
Kashmiri Pandits in their just cause -- which is a demand for a 
homeland -- is not communalism. Conceding that 
Kashmir is "Muslim" is reverse communalism. Kashmiri 
Pandits have a sound case and it should be presented in every 
international forum. The Government has to stop being defeatist. 
Kashmir cannot be given away to Pakistan; nor can it be handed 
over on a platter to Islamic fundamentalists. The safe return of 
the Kashmiri Pandits to their ancestral homes is -- and should 
be -- the special responsibility of the Government of India 
which cannot be dodged or made slight of. Kashmir is the 
homeland of the Pandits -- and so it will remain.

<F P=106> [Article by Amitabh Kautilya: "America's Interest in Playing </F>
the Kashmir Game is Increasing"] 
  [Text] Pigeon raising and kite flying are hobbies like 
running for elections, as are addictions to heroin, charas, and 
hashish. Countries, just like humans, have their weaknesses. For 
example, playing with Kashmir is becoming a new addiction for 
the United States. Only politicians know the political reasons 
for it. Our knowledge about it is very different. Professor 
Ronald C. Kessler, chairman of sociology department at Michigan 
University, has written in the latest issue of the 
Archives of General Psychiatry, that he is not afraid 
or hesitant in admitting that about half the U.S. population is 
suffering from one or another form of mental sickness. 
  It is important to note that a female official Raphel in the 
U.S. State Department who had visited India last year had went 
as far as to say that the documents about Kashmir's joining 
India are dubious in nature. If someone talks like this, we 
cannot call her anything but insane. There have been elections 
in Kashmir several times and the Kashmiri people had taken part 
in them. 
  Now another U.S. official has insisted that a plebescite 
must 
be held in Kashmir. Earlier, another gentleman had said that 
representatives of Kashmiri people should be included in talks 
between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has been demanding a 
plebiscite in Kashmir for a long time. Its voice was subdued as 
long as we kept holding elections. However, when it managed to 
make half the Kashmiris flee the land though its terrorist 
activities, it has increased its demand for a plebiscite 
considering it an appropriate time for it. This time, the United 
States is not only becoming an unwanted guest while agreeing 
with Pakistan, it is establishing itself where it does not 
belong. 
  China also became very alert when it saw the increasing 
romance between Pakistan and United States over Kashmir. 
Similarly, the way Janata Dal legislators are becoming 
disillusioned with Imam Buhkhari, China's romance with Pakistan 
is also breaking off. China has made it clear that no other 
party should be involved in the Pakistan-India talks, 
  It seems that the Indian Government has concluded the same 
thing as my own Sheikh Chilly [dunce] brand intelligence has 
determined. The Indian Government has contracted an American 
specialist firm to counter the Kashmiri and Khalistani 
propaganda in the United States. This professional organization 
has been contracted only for six months beginning from 15 
January. 
  Evidently the Indian Government had to take this step when 
it 
had no alternatives left. The Pakistani embassy already has been 
using this strategy. This firm is not only presenting Pakistani 
claims to the U.S. Senators and those who form public opinion, 
but is also is spreading this deplorable propaganda that India 
is violating human rights in Kashmir. It was just such a firm 
that had pulled the miracle of making Indian rugs untouchable 
things in U.S. and European markets under the pretext of human 
rights violations and abuse of child labor. 
  It happens in mental sickness, that a deranged person 
understands only what is told to him. A crazy person will 
believe that he is an owl or the president, This is because 
either he lacks the brain cells that can distinguish fact from 
fiction or these are as weak as the BSP-SP [Bahujan Samaj 
Party-Samajwadi Party] coalition in Uttar Pradesh. 
  This survey has brought to light the fact that half of the 
U.S. population is crazy, therefore, we should not be surprised 
if half of its population believes that Kashmir is a part of 
Pakistan and India has illegally occupied that region just like 
Iraq had occupied Kuwait. 
  I was getting depressed thinking about it all, especially 
because according to the agreement signed recently, the Russian 
cannons will be aimed at other targets than the United States of 
America. In this time of crisis, if there is a ray of hope then 
it comes from China which has become very alert to the U.S. 
attitude. May God keep it on the alert. Someone was perfectly 
right when he said that a drowning man reaches for straws to 
save himself. China is on the alert also because if the United 
States gets to China in this monkey distribution system, China 
may lose a lot. 
  The other reason for worry is that the 1.2 million talented 
and rich Indians who live or study in the United States might 
import to India mental sickness in addition to AIDS. We have one 
example of it. Despite this large population of Indian people 
living in the United States, India had to hire a private firm to 
counter the Pakistani propaganda. It is possible that patriotism 
and love for India disappears just like moustaches once one 
lands in the United States. 
  The game played in Kuwait increased the U.S. prestige and 
inspired fear in Asia. It appears that the United States wants 
to play the game of Kashmir because of it. It is important to 
mention here that some habits are so strong that they go with 
one's funeral. The Kashmir game might take the United States in 
that direction. We think that far ahead because a soothsayer 
said 400 years ago that there will be a divine incarnation in 
1999 that will establish India's dominance all over the world. 
India is moving toward that moment very fast. 
  Just like this huge country does not have even one athlete 
who could win even one gold medal in the Olympics, we do not 
have even one Goebbels with a powerful brain to have the ability 
to prove truth as lie and lie as truth. If we had such a 
brilliant person born here, the Indian Government would not have 
to knock at the doors of a private firm. There still is no idea 
how we will benefit from it. It is possible that this firm might 
have contracts with Pakistan and the so-called Khalistanis to 
get popular support for them. Lawyers have the ethical 
requirement that they cannot represent the defendant and the 
plaintiff at the same time. A business organization does not 
have such restrictions. The same firm can print posters for the 
Samajwadi Party and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. One 
publicity firm can make a publicity film for the Congress (I) 
and the National Front! 
  If the U.S. craze continued then it is possible for it to 
have the opportunity to impact on Kashmir. What can we say about 
our government as we do not know in which world it is. It is 
still following the Article of the Indian Constitution which 
allows separate laws for Kashmir. This Article is causing a 
major problem. We cannot send new people to work in the 
positions vacated by the patriots who are fleeing Kashmir. Would 
not Kashmir be replete with patriotic brave people if we did not 
have this law? 
  The Indian Government spokesmen repeatedly say that Kashmir 
is India's integral part, however, India does not have the 
courage to remove the discrepancies within the Constitution. Had 
it that much courage, we believe then the United States would 
not have been so eager to play the Kashmir game, and Pakistan 
had to worry about creating a new strategy and setting off a new 
squib to the world. If Pakistan is eager for a nuclear war then 
it will have it. One benefit of it will be that when the new 
century arrives, there will be no Pakistan left and all the 
neighbors will be enjoying peace. We have to make as much 
sacrifice for peace and goodwill in the next century as we did 
by living in hapless conditions for the last 45 years in the 
name of progress.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The American Grip"] </F>
  [Text] A fortnight after his mischievous letter about 
Punjab, President Clinton has written a mischievous letter about 
Kashmir now. He has written the last letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, 
the president of the Kashmiri American Council who supports 
terrorists in Kashmir. This letter is addressed to Gary Condit 
in response to a letter written by 15 U.S. lawmakers. In this 
letter he had agreed with the concern expressed by these 
legislators about Punjab and had supported a resolution of the 
Punjab problem in which the human rights of the Sikhs are 
protected. When the letter from Clinton to Ghulam Nabi Fai was 
shared, the U.S. administration had tried to clarify that there 
has been no change in the U.S. stand and it was not necessary to 
dwell too much on the letter written to Ghulam Nabi Fai. It was 
said that this letter was just a formality and not a 
specifically written letter. However, the recent letter about 
Punjab does not leave any room for reassurance about Bill 
Clinton's designs. 
  Thus, the Indian Government had no alternative but to take 
these negative signs coming from the United States of America 
seriously. It is imperative that it mobilize its ambassador in 
the United States to object to the U.S. stand and state that 
such actions will adversely effect U.S.-India relations. 
However, doing this will not be enough. This is not the first 
time that Bill Clinton and his government have shown such an 
aggressive attitude toward India. We have already seen U.S. 
actions such as laws relating to intellectual property and the 
NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. This U.S. policy is pushing India 
toward the wall using the so-called human rights issue which the 
United States is using in the context of Kashmir and Punjab. 
  The fear that a democratic president, once elected, would 
increase pressure on India was expressed in the circles that 
sympathize with India before the presidential elections in the 
United States. This fear was based on the fact that democratic 
presidents are very active on human rights and the NPT, and the 
anti-India lobbies have been very active over these two issues 
for some time. At the same time, it is believed that the United 
States will impose its economic policies very aggressively in 
order to fight the economic recession at home. In this context, 
it will exert a lot of pressure over the laws relating to 
intellectual property. Keeping in mind these old fears, the 
anti-India attitude of the U.S. President and his administration 
was not taken seriously. 
  However, the attitude of Bill Clinton and his administration 
cannot be ignored as the expected attitude of a Democrat 
President. Another reason is that the United States is now 
ignoring all the Pakistani activities to encourage terrorists in 
India. Second, Bill Clinton's attitude about Kashmir and Punjab 
is also directly encouraging the terrorists in Kashmir and 
Punjab. Obviously, Bill Clinton cannot be unaware of the results 
of his actions. We have to conclude that the United States is 
deliberately increasing pressure on India and trying to weaken 
it. In this situation, India cannot be satisfied just be 
registering its objection at diplomatic level. It must see and 
understand how it can counter this anti-Indian attitude of the 
United States.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Kashmir Hysteria"] </F>
  [Text] It is not only unfortunate, but mischievous as well, 
that, while India has sent six proposals to improve relations 
with Pakistan, there is some sort of a race taking place in 
Pakistan to keep the anti-India campaign at a feverish pitch. 
In an address to the nation, Prime Minister Bhutto said the day 
is not far off when Kashmir will be a part of Pakistan. She 
said her government would ask the Geneva-based Human Rights 
Commission to expose Indian repression in Kashmir. Whatever 
gestures one makes, Pakistan does not want to cool off the 
anti-Indian tirade. With the same objective in mind, a call has 
been made to observe a general strike in Pakistan on 5 February 
on the Kashmir issue. 
  The Pakistani Government last week sent two nonofficial 
proposals on holding a plebiscite in Kashmir that were rejected 
by India because it said only the Shimla Agreement could be the 
basis for talks. On the other hand, Pakistan believes that 
unless the so-called repression in Kashmir is not stopped, 
jailed Kashmiris are not freed, and the siege of Hazratbal 
Shrine in Srinagar not ended, there could be no meaningful 
dialogue with India. Obviously, Pakistan does not desire 
negotiations at all. It is only putting forth excuses. 
Pakistan should realize that eventually all issues are settled 
through talks and not by guns. If Pakistan still does not 
desire to enter into a dialogue, it will mean that it is not 
serious and wants to vitiate the atmosphere before the start of 
any negotiations. 
  The six proposals sent by India are definitely significant 
in 
the context of the normalization of relations. India has 
proposed to maintain peace at the Line of Control in Kashmir -- 
like the one agreed upon with China, although both sides will 
not give up their claims. This means that as an interim measure 
it will be accepted that for the time being that the 
Pakistan-ruled part of Kashmir will remain with it and the 
Indian-ruled Kashmir with us, while mutual talks will continue 
on the border claims. If Pakistan does not accept such a 
revolutionary proposal, it will be clear that its intentions are 
not honest. After all, how would Pakistan be threatened if it 
agrees to the proposal that no country make the first use of its 
nuclear capability against one another? The above two proposals 
are aimed at creating mutual trust. The demilitarization of 
Siachen Glacier, the delineation of Sir Creek maritime boundary 
near Kutch, and the settlement of the Tulbul barrage issue are 
all proposals made by India in good faith. Revitalizing the 
Joint Working Commission is also a need of the hour. If 
Pakistan agrees to hold talks on all these proposals, a 
favorable atmosphere will be created for a dialogue on Kashmir 
as well. Pakistan will achieve nothing by putting the Kashmir 
gun on India's temple. India is fully capable of defending its 
borders. Pakistan is intimidating the world by shouting Kashmir, 
Kashmir, and by doing so it is also gaining sympathy. We should 
strive to counter Pakistan's Kashmir diplomacy. Dialogue should 
go on, Pakistan should be brought to its senses and war 
readiness should be ensured, that is the only alternative left 
for India. However, the best scenario will be if good sense 
prevails upon Pakistan and it comes to the talks with a 
realistic approach.

<F P=106> [Article by Raj Mohan Vajpayee: "No Solution to the Kashmir </F>
Problem Will Be Had From Headsupmanship"] 
  [Text] There has been a major change in the U.S. attitude. 
During the cold war it used its destructive military might as a 
medium for political victories, however, this policy was not 
successful. Vietnam is a prominent example of this failure. The 
U.S. viewpoint changed after the fall of the Soviet Union. It is 
implementing a policy of having various parties hold talks in 
order to maintain its dominance. Examples of these efforts are 
the Arab-Israeli talks and talks among the Serb, Croat, and 
Muslim communities in Bosnia. 
  The United States may have its own interests in holding 
these 
talks. We would be ignoring facts if we believe that this police 
work being done by the United States to establish law and order 
at international level is an unselfish deed. Have these policies 
succeeded in establishing peace in the nations involved? Has the 
fighting and the mutual destruction changed? We can surmise the 
answer to these questions by reviewing the present world 
situation. 
  The statements issued by President Clinton and his 
administration over India-Pakistan relations have created a 
controversial situation. If we look at former President Bush's 
term, we will find that there is a major difference between the 
two. It would be wrong to believe that the role of bilateral 
talks in the U.S. policy, especially in foreign policy or 
international relations, is not important. It has helped various 
nations depending on their interests and their having 
cooperated--be it Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Israel, or Pakistan. The 
fact that it did not help them because of altruistic reasons is 
a different issue. 
  The Jammu-Kashmir question has an important place in 
India-Pakistan relations. It would be ignoring facts if we think 
that the bitterness between India and Pakistan will end if the 
Jammu-Kashmir issue is resolved. There are many chasms between 
the two countries, and it would not be appropriate to say that 
if one chasm is filled up the other chasms will not cause 
problems. 
  If we say that the United States is very worried over 
Kashmir, then it must be shedding crocodile tears or it is the 
change in its foreign policy affected after the fall of the 
Soviet Union. Why did not the U.S. attitude change when Pakistan 
gave away Aksai Chin region to its then-declared enemy China? 
The United States continued to be Pakistan's supporter and 
adopted a harsh attitude toward India. 
  There is no doubt that Pakistan used aggressive lobbying to 
keep its position strong in the United States, and India has 
been laggard in this area. India has recently been expressing 
its reactions to various developments. It is clear from India's 
spending about 8 billion rupees for lobbying that our policy is 
very myopic and ineffective. The results are in front of us; the 
United States is not influenced by the Indian side. 
  A while ago, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel declared the 
1947 merger of Jammu-Kashmir with India to be totally 
disputable. Earlier, the almost-appointed ambassador to India, 
Solarz, had also disappointed the Indian government with his 
statements. It is not true that Siddhartha Shankar Ray, the 
present Indian ambassador to the Untied States, has been 
successful in presenting the Indian side effectively to the 
United States. Therefore, the wrong impressions that the United 
States has about India will remain for some time. 
  We cannot deny that after the Robin Raphel statement, there 
has existed an anti-United States attitude among all Indian 
opposition parties, intellectuals, and the media. The United 
States did not express any reaction to Raphel's statements in 
the beginning. However, seeing the increasing Indian reaction, 
spokesmen and officials in the Clinton administration issued 
statements declaring the Jammu-Kashmir related announcements to 
be personal opinions, that there has been no change in the U.S. 
policy on India and expressed happiness at the India-Pakistan 
talks at the secretary level. 
  The words of Woodrow Wilson Center's Mitchell Reese about 
India-Pakistan relations seem to be very realistic. According to 
him, the Kashmir issue cannot be used to hinder resolution of 
other problems. He believes that resolution of various minor 
problems will create an atmosphere conducive of resolving larger 
issues. Before the 2 January talks at foreign secretary level, 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had said that India-Pakistan 
relations will not improve until the Kashmir issue is taken care 
of. The foreign minister of Pakistan also announced in 
Parliament that Jammu-Kashmir would become a part of Pakistan 
within the next five years because India would have fallen by 
then. We can call these statements efforts by Pakistani rulers 
to impress the Pakistani people or to shut up the opposition. 
However, why is the United States ignoring such statements by 
one side when efforts are being made to improve India-Pakistan 
relations? Does the United States think that Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto has the right to declare in the United States 
that Pakistan will never suspend its nuclear program? Pakistan 
will continue to expand its program despite all the pressure, 
and pressure will be put on India to sign the NPT. Clinton is 
talking about removing the various restrictions imposed on 
Pakistan. What can we infer from such American thinking? 
  There is no doubt that Pakistan, Kashmiri militant 
organizations, and their supporters have retained the services 
of such companies as Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly for 
powerful and effective lobbying. This not only spreads their 
ideas and statements, but also influences important people. It 
is believed that an organization of non-resident Kashmiris, the 
Kashmiri-American Council, that supports a plebiscite in 
Kashmir, has hired the expensive lobbying firm of Stone and 
Kelly. One major result of this effort is President Clinton's 
ten-line long letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, the executive director 
of the Kashmiri-American Council. We find that the 
Washington-based organization Kashmiri-American Council is 
strongly opposed to Maharajah Hari Singh's merger of 
Jammu-Kashmir with India. This organization has challenged 
Jammu-Kashmir's merger with India from the very beginning. There 
is no doubt that this organization receives all kind of support 
from Pakistan, other Islamic nations that agree with it, and 
various so-called human rights organizations. 
  President Clinton told Ghulam Nabi Fai in his letter that he 
would like to work with people like him to establish peace in 
Kashmir. He expressed his agreement with Fai and wrote that the 
human rights aspect should have a strong place in his policies 
in the changed world situation after the Cold War. It is 
possible that Clinton's letter was just expressing hope for the 
future. However, Ghulam Nabi Fai, the Kashmiri-American 
Council, and its members will not only propagate it as U.S. 
agreeing with them, but also prove a major headache for India by 
amplifying the effect of this letter. If we look at the events 
prior to this letter, it should be clear that Assistant 
Secretary Robin Raphel's opinion about Kashmir and the feelings 
hidden in President Clinton's letter complement each other. A 
third party has been added to the Kashmir problem. 
  If we look at the Jammu-Kashmir issue and India-Pakistan 
relations, we will learn that White House residents before 
Clinton had repeatedly said that India and Pakistan should 
resolve this issue according to the Shimla agreement of 1972. 
There is no mention of a third party in the Shimla agreement. 
The UN resolutions call for the people of Jammu, Kashmir, and 
Laddakh to decide whether they want to stay in India or 
Pakistan. The question arises whether the present situation is 
appropriate for holding a plebiscite. Is there a specific 
deadline for such an atmosphere? What will the situation be like 
in Jammu-Kashmir when an appropriate situation is created? 
  If we look at the U.S. President's opinions as these appear, 
it seems that there have been major changes in the foreign 
policy and the thinking of the influential people in the 
administration after the end of the cold war. From the Indian 
perspective, especially within the framework of India-Pakistan 
relations, this change does not agree with the Indian view 
point. The United States, despite its open denial, does want to 
establish its supremacy here. It seems that the events related 
to Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti have not taught a lesson to the 
U.S. policy-makers. The strong U.S. desire to dominate the talks 
in Jammu-Kashmir will not resolve this issue because both India 
and Pakistan do not want the Kashmiri people to make a decision 
against them. In addition, even when we grant that India and 
Pakistan may change their Kashmir-related policy under 
international pressure, will it help a move toward permanent 
peace?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Letter Writer to American President"] </F>
  [Text] A cartoon has been published in newspapers showing 
U.S. President Bill Clinton busy writing letters by dipping his 
pen in a pot containing poison instead of ink. Meanwhile, 
official circles in the United States have expressed surprise 
over the hue and cry in India centering around the two letters 
written by President Clinton. They even questioned why the 
Indian Government felt it necessary to lodge protests over the 
letters. Washington stated that the President's office receives 
many letters every day, and his staff prepares the reply to the 
letters selected by them. It added that the President only puts 
his signature on letters drafted by his staff. The President 
does not have the time to go through these letters to see what 
has been written. Their clarification is not totally untrue. 
If the President had to reply to all the letters received by 
his office, then perhaps he would not have time to do other 
tasks, including eating and bathing. However, the explanation 
given by the President's aides is not acceptable. It is 
surprising to note that letters written on political issues are 
taken so lightly by the President's office, and replies to such 
letters are also prepared in the same manner. It is desirable 
that the President's signature carry more weight. 
  The President should decide which letters should be selected 
for replies. He cannot refuse to give a reply to the letter 
written by Congressman Gary A. Condit who belongs to his own 
party. Someone should have the responsibility of going through 
the subject matter of the letter and taking precautions in 
replying so that it does not hurt those who are concerned with 
it. It is possible that the close aides of the President can 
work in accordance with their own likings and dislikings and 
justify their actions in the name of the President. Congressman 
Condit might feel encouraged to plead shamelessly for the 
militants of Khalistan with a view to pleasing a section of the 
voters in his constituency. However, the tone of the 
President's letter shows that he is himself pleading for the 
Sikhs. In replying to another letter sent by the pro-Pakistan 
Kashmiri American Council, President Clinton's letter gives the 
impression that he is raising the issue of protecting human 
rights in Kashmir with a view to assisting the secessionists. 
The U.S. Government spokesman has said that such an 
interpretation of the President's letter is unfortunate. He 
further added that Washington does not support terrorists or 
secessionist activities in any part of the globe. Their claim 
may not be wrong, but it does not seem that staff of the White 
House have the professional skill to prove their claim in the 
case of India. 
  It should be noted that the Indian Government did not 
hesitate to lodge a strong protest in this regard. New Delhi 
also expressed its dissatisfaction over the issue through its 
ambassador in Washington, Siddharta Shankar Ray. It is 
necessary to lodge protests against the tendency of the present 
U.S. administration to indulge in unnecessary bossing. However, 
it would not be proper to think that the responsibility of India 
is over after the lodging of the protest. It is a type of 
weakness to display reaction over all matters. On one hand, we 
claim that human rights are not being violated in Punjab, 
Kashmir, or any other part of the country, while on the other, 
we will express our anger if anyone wants to probe into the 
alleged violations. This is not fair. In the past, several 
attempts were made to tarnish the image of our armed forces by 
bringing false charges against them. This is not acceptable. 
It is necessary to follow an open-door policy with a view to 
protecting the image of our armed forces. This would help in 
removing the doubts and the concern being expressed over human 
rights violations. It is true that the army and the police 
sometimes resort to repression, but the number of such incidents 
is very small. For this reason, it is good to confess the 
truth. This is the best way to close the mouths of those who 
protest. We should give up the habit of concealing to make 
others think that we have nothing to conceal.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bhutto: `Not Enough'"] </F>
  [Text] Six proposals, reports say, have been sent by India 
to Pakistan in a serious attempt to have normal relations with 
its neighbour. The package offered once again reflects India's 
desire to resolve all bilateral issues with Pakistan amicably. 
Outstanding issues have evaded a solution mainly because of the 
rigid postures adopted by Islamabad. U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's recent pronouncements have encouraged such an 
inflexible posture taken by the government of Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto. Pakistan, it would appear, has embarked on a revanchist 
policy. Whether it is army rule or an elected regime, 
India-baiting is the favoured game of politicians and generals. 
They have used it to ascend to power. The U.S., seeking a sway 
over South Asia, is another factor that continues to bedevil 
relationships in this subcontinent. The present unipolar regime 
has created serious difficulties for countries like India which 
believe in peaceful and harmonious co-existence. But Pakistan 
is a country of this region: It cannot change the geography of 
its location. India rightly expects Pakistan to appreciate and 
reciprocate the sincerity with which the six proposals have been 
offered to defuse tensions. Broadly, the proposals relate to 
disengagement of the embattled forces in the Siachen area; 
demarcation of the boundary in the Sir Creek area in the Runn of 
Kutch; the marine boundary in the same area; talks on Tulbul 
navigation project; additional confidence building measures 
relating to nuclear energy installations; restructuring the 
working of the sub-commissions under the Indo-Pak Joint 
Commission; and ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of 
Control in Jammu and Kashmir. These proposals were handed over 
to Pakistan's High Commissioner Riaz Khokhar by foreign 
secretary J.N. Dixit as promised by him at the last round of 
talks with Pakistan foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan. Most of 
these have been discussed with Pakistan and as a result these 
have undergone some refinements. Though India controls the 
entire Siachen glacier, with Pakistani positions to the west of 
the Saltora range from point 9842, this country has proposed 
disengagement -- India willing to pull out from Zingrulme and 
Pakistan withdrawing from the Saltora ridge. Significantly, 
Delhi has said that any disengagement or redeployment of forces 
would be without prejudice to each other's positions. The 
proposals stipulates that neither country shall re-occupy the 
vacated areas or undertake any military mountaineering or other 
activity in the area. On the nuclear issue, the two countries 
agreed not to attack each other's installations. India has now 
proposed no-first use of each other's nuclear capability; 
non-attack on population centres and economic targets. This is 
regarded as a step towards eventual non-use and eradication of 
nuclear weapons. To ensure peace and tranquility along the LoC 
[Line of Control] in J and K [Jammu and Kashmir], India has 
proposed several measures to prevent violation of tranquility. 
Mechanism should be devised to monitor violations by 
infiltrators and checking cross-border movement of arms. 
Pakistan has been urged to fix a date for another round of 
talks. Delhi expects a positive response and would like 
Islamabad to see the package as a sign of resilence to restore 
normalcy instead of viewing it as a sign of weakness. Pakistan, 
with an eye on Washington's moves, has predictably responded by 
taking a negative stand, repeating the propaganda line on 
Kashmir and human rights.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time To Say: `So Be It'"] </F>
  [Text] The fact has been reestablished that Pakistan will 
not refrain from interfering in Kashmir. The world is moving 
toward peace; if Pakistan's intentions are really peaceful, it 
should not have rejected India's six proposals without any 
contemplation or reflection. Although no official response has 
been received from Pakistan, the way and the impetuousness with 
which Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan rejected the 
proposals -- telling the press they said nothing about the 
important and key issue of Kashmir -- shows that Pakistan's 
claim that it does not assist terrorists in India is a white lie. 
  At least two of India's proposals are historic. First, India 
said that peace should be maintained at the Kashmir line of 
control. Without relinquishing their claims, both sides should 
-- as an interim measure -- accept it as the genuine line of 
control. India's second historic proposal was that neither 
country should be the first to use nuclear weapons. 
  Pakistan argues that recognizing the line of control as the 
genuine line of control would be tantamount to accepting the 
status quo ante, which runs counter to Benazir Bhutto's 
pronouncement in a recent address to the nation that Kashmir 
will one day be a part of Pakistan. Obviously, if Pakistan does 
not accept this proposal, it means that it considers Kashmir to 
be its own. To realize this aim, Pakistan is assisting 
terrorists in Kashmir and sending in infiltrators and 
mercenaries. India should understand the implications of this 
and expose Pakistan at the international level. Pakistan objects 
to the proposal rejecting first use of the nuclear bomb because 
it wants to keep this option open in the context of Kashmir. 
Now, when you have reached an accord on not attacking each 
other's nuclear installations, why should this proposal 
rejecting the first use of nuclear weapons pose a predicament? 
Pakistan's intentions are definitely dubious, and it wants to 
intimidate India. It is with the aim of intimidating India that 
repeated disclosures have been made that Pakistan has already 
manufactured a nuclear device. Now why would India -- which 
carried out a nuclear explosion in Pokharan in 1974 -- be 
intimidated by such threats? 
  The best scenario would be for good sense to prevail in 
Pakistan and for it to accept India's revolutionary proposals. 
Otherwise, the United States will become active again and 
harass both countries. It is said that India and Pakistan were 
on the verge of a nuclear war in 1990, which the United States 
averted through its able diplomacy. The United States will not 
repeat this action in the name of charity. This time it will 
want to exercise control over both countries. 
  Pakistan is not stopping its mischief in Kashmir. Fresh 
evidence has come from what happened yesterday. Pakistan 
carried out a rocket attack on civilian areas in the Punch 
sector, injuring 27 people. Similar attacks have been carried 
out for three days in a row. A bomb was found near the line of 
control that exploded when touched, injuring many school 
children. The time has come for a limited response to the 
Pakistani attacks. On 1 February, Benazir Bhutto is going to 
make venomous statements at the UN Human Rights Commission in 
Geneva about so-called human rights violations in Kashmir. 
  All of this means that Pakistan is engaged in a campaign to 
destroy India by all three means -- intentions, words, and deeds 
-- and does not want a dialogue. Therefore, we should be able 
to say: "So be it."

Kashmiri Pandit community during the last five years have been 
viewed by the public in general and the government in 
particular, is an indication of the poor state of health of our 
society. Apart from the low level of response to human pain and 
suffering, other sections of the public have shown little 
awareness of similar fate visiting them, in one form or the 
other, if "indifference of the bystanders" persists and 
callousness continues to dominate the national ethos. "If today, 
your anguish is not mine, tomorrow my anguish will not be yours." 
<H5>  The History </H5>
  The Kashmiri Pandits are a community which invites envy at 
their achievement as well as sorrow at their plight now. In one 
way, its members have played a dominant role in ruling India 
after August 1947. In another way, the community has been 
hounded by a deep sense of insecurity in the Valley. In one way, 
again, it has been a well-knit community, and, in another way, 
hopelessly divided and leaderless. The community's long history 
has been one of triumphs and tragedies -- steady and silent 
triumphs and tumultuous and terrible tragedies. Like Kashmir's 
weather, the bright, sunny, cool and crisp days have been 
punctuated by floods and famines and of grey and depressing 
clouds. 
<H5>  Who Are the Kashmiri Pandits? </H5>
  About 5,000 years ago, there existed a highly-developed 
community, with a "profound spiritual culture", along the banks 
of the river Saraswati, which, according to the Vedas, was the 
Mother of Rivers. The Rig Veda (II, 41.16) speaks of it as "the 
best mother, the best river, the best goddess". 
  Recent researches, particularly of Dr V. S. Wakankar, 
conducted with sophisticated instruments such as multi-spectoral 
scanner have clearly established that Saraswati was not a 
mythological river. It actually existed and flowed from the 
foothills of the Himalayas, through what is now Thar desert to 
the Rann of Kutch near the Arabian Sea. It dried up because its 
main tributary, Sutlej, changed its course, approximately at a 
right angle, consequent to geological changes. 
  After the drying up of the Saraswati, the community, which 
lived on the banks, dispersed. A section of this community 
comprising Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas, moved towards the 
mountains and finally settled in the Kashmir Valley. Amongst the 
settlers, the Brahmins soon acquired a pre-eminent position, 
largely because of their great learning in mathematics, 
philosophy, astrology and law. In course of time, they came to 
be known as the Kashmiri Pandits. 
<H5>  Contribution </H5>
  The mother tongue of the Kashmiri Pandits was Sanskrit, and 
they made the Valley a great nursery of Hindu culture. Many 
schools of thought were developed, including the celebrated 
Trikka philosophy, popularly called Kashmir Saivism. The 
tradition of guru-sishwa (teacher-disciple) was 
firmly established. Every student had to learn at least four 
Vedas, six Angas, besides astrology, music and the sciences. All 
this has justifiably given the Valley the name of Saradapeeth -- 
the seat of Sarada, the Goddess of Learning. 
  The kings of Kashmir and those of the other parts of north 
India had strong links and were motivated by the same type of 
cultural and political aspirations. Gonanda, the first known 
king of Kashmir, was a relation and a friend of Jarasandha, king 
of Magadha. He was followed by 44 kings. Thereafter, Asoka 
(272-232 BC) extended his control over Kashmir. Three centuries 
later, the Kushans established their rule. 
  They were followed by a number of Hindu kings, including 
Abhimanyu, Vibhishana and Indrajit. Their names, which are 
familiar to the readers of Ramayana, suggest close 
affinity between Kashmir and other parts of India. Lalitaditya 
(721-761), who built the famous temple of Martanda, in honour of 
the Sun God, and who could be compared to Napoleon in his 
military skill; Avantivarman (855-883), who was a great patron 
of men of letters and the founder of Avantipur; and Jaya Simha 
(1127-1155), who effectuated a "great renaissance", were the 
three outstanding kings whose contribution to Indian culture, 
religion, philosophy, art and architecture is truly remarkable. 
They were admirably served by the Kashmiri Pandits. It has 
appropriately been remarked that "ancient India has nothing more 
worthy of its early civilisation than the grand ruins of 
Kashmir". 
<H5>  The Elites </H5>
  The Kashmiri Pandits constituted a powerful elite group 
during the reigns of Hindu kings. Their material needs were 
mostly met by the royal families and establishments. Such was 
their influence on society that, by resorting to collective 
fasting, they could virtually force the monarch to concede their 
demands, reasonable or unreasonable. 
<H5>  Vicissitudes </H5>
  In the early 14th century, with the conversion of the then 
ruler, Rinchana, Muslim rule commenced. As Aurel Stein has 
noted, "Islam made its headway in Kashmir, not by forcible 
conquest but by gradual conversion." But coercive methods were 
often employed and crass fanaticism was not unknown. 
  The Pandit community underwent its most tragic phase during 
the regime of Sultan Sikander (1389-1413), who came to be known 
as "But-Shikan", destroyer of idols. "There was no city, no 
town, no village, no wood, where the temples of gods remained 
unbroken." 
  The Sultan even tried to pull down the famous temple of 
Martand. A relentless campaign for conversion to Islam was 
launched, under the charge of the Sultan's chief minister, Malik 
Saif-ud-Din, who, ironically, was himself a Kashmiri Brahmin 
before his conversion. As Ferishta recorded, "Many Brahmins, 
rather than abandon their religion or their country, poisoned 
themselves; some emigrated from their native homes, while a few 
escaped the evil of banishment by becoming Mohammedans." 
  Rajtarangini of Jonaraja portrayed the same tragic 
reality in these words: "The Brahmins fled. The difficult 
terrains through which they passed, the scanty food they ate, 
the painful illnesses and the torments they suffered during 
their lifetime removed the fear of hell from their minds. Only 
11 Pandit families were left." 
  Maybe the number 11 is only symbolically true; but the fact 
remains that at the end of Sultan Sikander's rule, the Kashmiri 
Brahmins were reduced to a microscopic minority. Sikander's 
policy was continued by his son, Sultan Ali Shah. He, too, 
remained under the influence of chief minister Saif-ud-Din. 
  The next Sultan, Zain-ul-Abidin (1420-1470 AD), turned out 
to 
be the most benevolent ruler that Kashmir has known. It has been 
correctly remarked that "history can give few examples where the 
policy was so completely reversed by the successor. Where 
Sikander destroyed, Zain-ul-Abidin restored; where the former 
banished, the latter recalled." Zain-ul-Abidin's reign, 
following that of Sikander and Ali Shah, was, in the words of 
historian Srivara, "like the cooling sandal paste after the heat 
of summer in a desert had departed". 
  In the end of the 15th century, under the influence of 
Shams-ud-Din Iraqi, the Kashmiri Brahmins were once again 
persecuted. The 15th century, thus, turned out to be one of the 
most fateful periods in the history of Kashmiri Pandits. Before 
this century, the community was intact and divided into 199 
exogamous gotras, the members of which claimed 
descent from the rishi whose name the 
gotra bore. to these gotras were now added 
the distinction between the Kashmiri Pandits who withstood the 
persecution and stayed in the Valley and those who migrated and 
later returned. The former were known as Malmasis and the 
latter, Bhanmasis. 
  By the time the Mughal rule commenced in Kashmir, the 
Pandits 
had regained their position. They identified themselves with 
Mughal manners and modes of administration. Their proficiency in 
Persian, the court language, proved a great asset. The Pandits 
became the backbone of the structure of governance at the middle 
level. Their prestige in society was also enhanced by Emperor 
Akbar's visit to the Martand Temple and offering a cow, with 
garlands of gold and jewels, as a gift. From the insignificant 
figure of 11, their number also increased. Their number was 
estimated by Abul Fazal to be 2,000 during Akbar's regime. 
  During Aurangzeb's long reign of 49 years, Kashmir saw 14 
governors. they generally ruled well. But one of them, Iftikar 
Khan (1671-1675), persecuted the Brahmins, and they approached 
the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur. They complained: "We suffer 
great atrocities, sacred threads (janeus) are 
forcibly taken off our persons. Cows are killed. 
Janeus, a maund-and-a-quarter in weight, are snapped 
in a single day." The Guru consoled them and said, "Go tell the 
Mughal rulers that if they converted Tegh Bahadur they would all 
voluntarily accept Islam." This infuriated the Imperial Court 
and led to the Guru's martyrdom. And the Sikh faith and history 
took a new turn. 
  After Aurangzeb's death, the Mughal empire began to crumble 
and the Afghans established their hegemony over Kashmir. The 
last Afghan governor, Jabbar Khan, persecuted the Pandits 
relentlessly. A Pandit nobleman, Birbal Dhar, unable to see any 
longer the Kashmiris being tormented and tortured, approached 
Maharaja Ranjit Singh for help and provided him with valuable 
information about the strength and deployment of Jabbar Khan's 
forces. Ranjit Singh had earlier made two unsuccessful attempts 
to capture Kashmir, once in 1812 and again in 1814. This time, 
success greeted Ranjit Singh. The Sikh forces, under the able 
command of Misser Dewan Chand, defeated Jabbar Khan at Shopiyan 
on 15 July, 1819, and triumphantly marched into the capital the 
next day. 
  The Sikh rule in Kashmir lasted only 27 years (1819-1846). 
It 
was followed by about 100 years of Dogra rule, when the British 
had a decisive say in all important matters. 
<H5>  Migration </H5>
  Over the years, a sizeable number of Kashmiri Pandits 
migrated to different parts of northern India. The migration was 
sometimes sizeable, and at other times in trickles, depending 
upon the persecution or discrimination at home and opportunities 
elsewhere. 
<H5>  Adaptation </H5>
  In regard to these migrants, Dhanvanthi Rama Rau, in her 
memoirs, An Inheritance, observes: "They were obliged 
to alter their dress from the loose robes and distinctive 
headcovering of Kashmiris to the Hindu saris for women and 
pyjamas and long coats for men, or to the trousers and tunics 
dictated by the Muslim Mughal Court. However, they continued to 
cling to their names and the customs, rites and ceremonies that 
belonged to their community." 
  The Kashmiri Pandits who migrated were somewhat different 
from the Brahmins of northern India. While the latter were 
highly conservative, strictly vegetarian, the Kashmiri Pandits 
were meat-eaters, scholarly, well-versed in Persian, and both 
adaptive and traditional. 
<H5>  The Present Tragedy </H5>
  Whatever be the vicissitudes of Kashmiri Pandits' history 
and 
whatever unkind quirks their fate might have brought to them in 
the past, all these pale into insignificance when compared to 
what has been happening to them since the middle of 1989. As a 
part of overall framework of terrorism and subversion in 
Kashmir, practically the entire community, totalling about 
250,000, was made to flee the Valley. The strategy adopted was 
to "kill one and frighten 1,000". 
<H5>  Canard </H5>
  When viewed in all its dimensions, the current phase of the 
Kashmiri Pandits' misfortune is the most calamitous. The grim 
tragedy is compounded by the equally grim irony that one of the 
most intelligent, subtle, versatile and proud community of the 
country is being virtually reduced to extinction in free India. 
The Pandits are suffering not under the fanatic zeal of medieval 
Sultans like Sikander or under the tyrannical regimes of the 
Afghan governors, but they are suffering under the supposedly 
secular rulers of independent India. What's worse, some 
politicians and their apologists, whose shallowness is matched 
only by their obstinacy to suppress documented facts and 
contemporary records, have been spreading the canard that I 
encouraged the migration of the Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley. 
  To bring out the truth about the so-called induced migration 
and also to delineate the chilling face of Kashmiri terrorism, I 
can do no better than quote from a letter of H. N. Jattu, 
president of the All-India Kashmiri Pandit Conference, which was 
published last year in local newspapers and a leading daily of 
Chandigarh. It reads, inter alia, as follows: 
  "It is wholly incorrect that I and other Kashmiri Pandits 
migrated from the Valley at the instance of Shri Jagmohan. The 
truth is exactly the opposite. Shri Jagmohan, in fact, did his 
level best to stop migration which had begun much earlier, when 
in broad daylight and on busy streets, eminent and innocent 
leaders of the Pandit community were being brutally murdered and 
the CM [chief minister], Dr Farooq Abdullah, was taking no 
action whatsoever or apprehending any culprit. Politician Tikka 
Lal Taploo was shot dead on 14 September, 1989, N. K. Ganjoo, a 
judge, was murdered on 4 November of that year and journalist P. 
N. Bhatt was killed on 28 December, 1989. 
  "The terror-stricken Pandit community, in a memorandum dated 
16 January, 1990, to the then Governor, General (Retd.) K. V. 
Krishna Rao, brought out the total ineffectiveness of the state 
government. 
  "When Kashmiri Pandits were being killed on the pretext that 
they were 'informers' and agents of the central government, I 
and some members of the All-India Kashmiri Pandit Conference 
discussed the alarming situation. After the meeting, I issued a 
press note on 21 February, 1990, which was published in the 
newspapers the following day. In this note, I had appealed to 
the militants not to kill Kashmiri Pandits by labelling them as 
informers, and if they had suspicion on any Pandit, they should 
bring it to the notice of our organisation. 
  "On 28 February, my young and energetic secretary, Ashok 
Kazi, of the All-India Kashmiri Pandit Conference, was done to 
death in the most inhuman and savage manner. He was bleeding 
profusely and crying, `End my agony by shooting me', but the 
murderers enacted a sort of death-dance around him and hurled 
all types of abuses on Pandits. All this happened on a busy 
thoroughfare. But no one came to his rescue. It was only the 
distant siren of a police van that made the killers to pump 
bullets into Ashok Kazi's body and finish him and disappear. 
  "On the same evening, I was abused over the telephone in the 
most filthy and unprintable language. Referring to Ashok Kazi's 
torturous killing, the caller said: 'Have you now got our reply 
to the press note? You dog, you will meet worse fate than Ashok 
Kazi.' From that day onwards, members of my community came to 
the conclusion that we were hoping against hope and must leave 
the Valley immediately to save our lives and the honour of our 
womenfolk. And the migration accelerated. 
  "On the other hand, Governor Jagmohan, who took over on 19 
January, 1990, tried very hard to persuade us not to leave. He 
fervently appealed to the Kashmiri Pandits, who had already 
migrated, to return to the Valley. He even offered to set up 
four temporary camps for them at Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramulla 
and Kupwara. This would be evident from his press note of 7 
March, 1990, which was widely published at that time. 
  "A number of other energetic steps which have now become a 
part of history were taken by Shri Jagmohan to retrieve a 
hopeless situation. At great personal risk, he visited the 
police stations in thickly-populated areas where the police 
machinery had totally broken down. To instill confidence in the 
highly demoralised Kashmiri Pandit community, he even went to 
the house of young Satish Tikka in Habbakadal, a congested and 
terrorist-infected locality. 
  "He consoled the old parents of Satish, who was brutally 
murdered after being called out in the street by his erstwhile 
friends. The Union home minister acknowledged all this when he 
said in Parliament on 25 April, 1990: `Jagmohan had to function 
in a vacuum, in a situation where there was no respect for law 
or authority of the state government. He braved terrorists, 
instilled courage in government officials who had almost given 
up the situation as a lost case. It is very unfair for anyone to 
criticise Jagmohan for what he has done for the country.' 
  "When an all-party committee, headed by deputy prime 
minister 
Devi Lal visited Srinagar, myself and Shri J. N. Sapru met him 
and the Union law minister Shri Dinesh Goswami, at Centaur 
Hotel, where the party was staying. We apprised them of our 
horrible plight -- how we are living under continuous fear of 
death, how threats and hysterical slogans of 
Nizam-e-Mustafa, etc. were blared simultaneously from 
hundreds of loudspeakers installed on the mosques, how hit lists 
were being displayed on the notice boards and how our womenfolk 
were being dishonoured. We also met Shri Rajiv Gandhi and spoke 
to him on similar lines. 
  "The waiters of the hotel, most of whom had turned 
collaborators of the militants on account of internal 
subversion, were listening. The director-general of police and 
the additional director-general (CID) came to know that the 
waiters had informed the militant leaders about what transpired 
at the aforesaid meetings. We were already on the hit list and 
they decided to intensify their efforts to get us immediately, 
so that punishment for speaking about their atrocities were 
carried out speedily. The director-general of police and the 
additional director-general thought that there was no effective 
way of saving our lives except to shift us to Jammu till 
conditions improved for our safe return. 
  "In the meanwhile, treacherous and brutal killings of 
innocent Kashmiri Pandits continued in the Valley. Those killed 
included prominent persons like engineer B. K. Ganjoo, poet 
Sarvanand Premi and his young son, Virender Kaul, professor K. 
L. Ganjoo and his wife and a teacher, C. L. Pandita. Press 
notices were prominently put out in widely-read dailies of 
Srinagar, namely, AFTAB and ALSAFA, requiring Kashmiri Pandits 
to leave within 48 hours, failing which they would run the risk 
of being exterminated. Photocopies of these notices have been 
printed by Shri Jagmohan in his well-known book, My Frozen 
Turbulence in Kashmir." 
  In the face of the above hard evidence, which remains 
unrebutted till date, could there by any doubt about the 
intentional falsehood coined about the migration of the Kashmiri 
Pandits from the Valley? 
<H5>  Wayward and Infirm State </H5>
  I am confident that, had I not been stabbed in the back by 
the most repugnant lies spoken in contemporary history, like 
those in regard to the Kashmiri Pandits, I would have built, 
during my second tenure, the same bonds of love and affection 
with both Hindus and Muslims, through selfless service and a 
clear and consistent policy of fairness, firmness and 
fearlessness, as I was able to do during my first tenure (April 
1984-June 1989). 
  Those who have any doubt about this proposition should go 
through the reports of reputed national dailies of early May 
1990. By that time, the corner had been decisively turned. The 
militants were on the run. The people had themselves started 
erasing pro-Pakistan and pro-aazadi slogans from the 
walls of public buildings and private houses. The capital, with 
thousands of government employees, including Kashmiri Pandits, 
had been shifted to Srinagar without a scratch on any head. 
Unfortunately, the wayward nature of the Indian state once again 
came into play and all the advantages secured were wantonly 
thrown away. 
  It speaks volumes about the infirmities of the Union 
government that it has created about 250,000 refugees in its own 
country, and that it is not their human rights violations, but 
those of the terrorists, that are usually discussed at the 
national and international fora. 
  Most of the Kashmiri migrants are staying on scanty relief, 
in miserable camps in Jammu, Nagrota, Udhampur and other cities. 
The children go to badly-maintained schools with hardly any 
furniture. The women have to cook in the open, even under the 
scorching sun or heavy rainfall. 
  That, during the last four years, none of the Prime 
Ministers 
-- V. P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar and Narasimha Rao -- have felt 
the prick of conscience to visit any of these camps shows how 
compassion has completely dried up in the minds of the Indian 
rulers. For them, politics is everything, justice and truth 
nothing. 
  It goes to the credit of the Kashmiri Pandit community that, 
even in such indifferent environment, it has not lost heart. Its 
various associations have been voicing their grievances 
vigorously and trying to get across the barriers of government 
apathy. A recent example of this phenomenon was the World 
Kashmiri Pandit Conference, organised in New Delhi, on 27 and 28 
December, 1993, by Panun Kashmir, an organisation which is 
dominated by the youths. 
<H5>  National Concern </H5>
  While it should be left to the community and its various 
organisations to sort out their differences on the blueprint for 
the future -- whether they want a separate Union Territory 
within the Valley or they want to go back with honour and 
dignity, with terrorism and subversion totally exterminated -- 
it is the duty of the government in particular and the Indian 
public in general, to stand by the community and relieve it of 
its distress in the shortest possible time. Its pain should be 
felt as national pain and its anguish as national anguish. We 
must all remember that "the only thing necessary for the triumph 
of evil is for good men to do nothing." 
[Box, p 62] 
<H5>  The Strangest Night </H5>
  I went on working in the secretariat and returned to Raj 
Bhavan late in the evening of 20 January, 1990. The night that 
followed was the strangest night that I have ever lived. Hardly 
I had gone to bed when the two telephones at my bedside started 
ringing, almost continuously. At the other end, there were 
voices of alarm, of concern, of fright, sometimes muted voices 
of men too terror-stricken to speak. 
  "Tonight is our last night," moaned one voice. "By morning, 
we -- all Kashmiri Pandits -- would be butchered," said another 
voice. "Send us aeroplanes; take us out of the Valley; evacuate 
us at night if you do not want to see our corpses in the 
morning," pleaded another. "Our womenfolk, our sisters, our 
mothers, would be abducted, and we menfolk slaughtered," 
shrieked yet another voice. 
  Some callers told me that they would just hold on to their 
telephones so that I could hear the terrible slogans and 
exhortations that were emanating from hundreds of loudspeakers 
fitted on the mosques. The noises, they said, were deafening and 
it appeared that a number of recorded tapes were being 
simultaneously played at a very loud pitch, causing horrible 
effects in resonance and permeating the atmosphere with terror 
and fear of imminent death. 
  What was it all about? How is it that such a large number of 
loudspeakers had been installed and the same calls were being 
made from them? How was this technique of arousing mass frenzy 
acquired? Who had masterminded this well-knit organisation? And 
how was it that such a build-up remained unnoticed? Was it a 
case of default or connivance or both? 
  (Extracted from Jagmohan's book, My Frozen Turbulence 
in Kashmir) 
[Box, pp 64, 65] 
<H5>  A Treacherous Murder </H5>
  On 2 February, 1990, Satish Tikoo, a young Kashmiri Pandit, 
was murdered near his house in Habbakadal. He was a social 
worker, an activist, who helped the people of his community 
secure redressal of their grievances. He was equally popular 
amongst the Hindu and Muslim youths of the locality. 
  Early in the morning, two Muslim youths, whom he apparently 
knew, called at his residence. His sister responded to the call. 
Sensing something sinister, she told the visitors that Satish 
was not at home. They went away, but lurked around the adjacent 
lanes. After a while, Tikoo came out of his room. His sister 
mentioned to him about the youths who had come to see him. He 
got a bit annoyed, and reprimanded his sister for being too 
suspicious. He could not imagine that someone had planned to 
kill him. 
  He stepped out of the house and peeped into the adjoining 
lanes and by-lanes. In a moment, a dreadful pistol shot was 
heard. The family rushed out. They found Tikoo in a pool of 
blood, motionless. 
  The brutal murder of Satish Tikoo was another blow to the 
already shattered morale of the Kashmiri Pandit community, This 
was bound to accelerate the pace of their migration which had 
been going on since the assassination of N. K. Ganju, Tikka Lal 
Taploo and P. N. Bhatt. 
  To generate some confidence in the community and to offer 
condolences to the bereaved family, I decided to visit Tikoo's 
house the following day. Accordingly, on the evening of 3 
February, I went to Habbakadal, an old and congested locality in 
the interior of the city. By that time, the curfew relaxation 
period was over. Except for the long row of our vehicles, 
nothing was to be seen on the streets. The afternoon rain 
appeared to have soaked the houses with depression. The few 
windows that were open were without even the usual dim light. 
The dark clouds overhead completed the picture of gloom. 
  "It is very unwise on our part," said a companion officer, 
"to move out like this in narrow lanes. A well-planned grenade 
attack can finish us all." I nodded in agreement. But my mind 
was elsewhere -- the slush and muck on the road; the threatening 
clouds above; the mute and dingy houses by the side of the road, 
and the overpowering silence all around. 
  The house of Tikoo was like a shattered nest. Everything lay 
scattered. I sat on the ground with the family members. An old 
lamp had been lit. It pierced the darkness only around me. 
Satish's father narrated the tragedy in a low, halting, voice. I 
thought it was unnecessary. The grim atmosphere around told the 
tale more vividly. 
  As I was about to leave, all the friends and relations of 
the 
family gathered there, demanded with one voice that they should 
be settled permanently outside the Valley. Satish's uncle, who 
was a bit vociferous and assertive, insisted that I should go 
upstairs and see the family deity. I agreed. 
  A calm majestic figure was soon visible. It looked so 
imposing even in the darkness. The man, his voice quivering with 
emotion, said: "Here we have lived for centuries under the 
benign grace of this deity. This house, this street, this lane 
and this by-lane, where we have lived since our birth, we can 
leave, but not this deity. You must provide us with suitable 
accommodation." I remained silent. This, I thought, was not the 
occasion to discuss such demands. With tears in their eyes, the 
family members thanked me and the accompanying officers. We were 
all moved by the sad plight of the family. 
  Looking at the compact and enmeshed houses, and the by-lanes 
which acted like fine threads of a well-knit fabric, I wondered 
how these families, who had all their gods and goddesses here, 
and had deep roots in the soil, could leave and settle in 
distant and unfamiliar lands. Sometimes life if unaccountably 
cruel. and we human beings have, perhaps no option but to suffer 
-- suffer in silence, or wail. 
  On 22 March, 1990, B. K. Ganjoo, a telecom engineer living 
in 
a Muslim-dominated locality in Srinagar incurred the wrath of 
the terrorists in the Valley. He had been warned by his 
neighbours that his name was on the hit-list, so when the 
terrorists burst into his house looking for him, he hid in a 
drum used to store rice. Not finding him in the room the 
terrorists riddled the drum -- and his body -- with bullets. 
After that, they asked his wife to cook the rice and feed it to 
the family. 
  A few days earlier, 30-year-old Navin Saproo, a central 
government employee, was returning home from office when 
terrorists sprayed him with bullets. A woman passer-by pleaded 
with them to spare him, but they pushed her aside and danced 
around the man who lay writhing in pain. As the sorrowing 
relatives took away Saproo's body, the terrorists followed them 
in a truck, right up to the cremation ground, singing and 
dancing till the body was reduced to ashes. 
  The stories abound. "Tum kehte ho kagaz dekhi, main 
kehta hoon aankhen dekhi (You only talk about what you have 
read, but I talk of what I have seen with my own eyes)," said Dr 
Agni Shekhar, quoting the poet Kabir, at the 1993 World Kashmiri 
Pandit Conference in Delhi. He went on to relate the tales of 
atrocities committed on the Kashmiri Pandits in Kashmir -- of 
which he and three lakh other refugees, scattered in camps in 
Jammu, Amritsar and Delhi, were eyewitnesses -- and there was 
not a dry eye left at the Siri Fort Auditorium. 
  The situation was charged with drama. An elderly man, 
weeping 
inconsolably, had to be ushered out. Noted film actor Anupam 
Kher asked for the lights to be switched on in the dimly-lit 
auditorium. "The Kashmiri Pandits have suffered enough in 
darkness," he intoned, in a voice choked with emotion. 
  "Our stories are as horrifying as those of Bosnia," said Dr 
Agni Shekhar, the convenor of the conference. "It is a case of 
ethnic cleansing, of cultural genocide. These are new terms for 
India, but our tragedy is a unique one." 
  According to Shekhar, more than 1,200 Kashmiri Hindus have 
been killed in the Valley, some 1,600 houses burnt and over 50 
temples destroyed in the last four years. Over three-and-a-half 
lakh Kashmiri Pandits have fled the Valley, most of whom are now 
living in camps. 
  And these refugees are a bitter lot. 
  "It is tragic that we are called 'refugees' in our own 
country," said Sushil Raina, in the camp at Amar Colony in 
Delhi. The camp houses 60 Kashmiri Pandits who sleep, cook and 
live in one large hall. Raina had his own medical store in 
Kashmir. But one day in 1990 he received a death threat. He 
didn't know who had sent him the threat, nor was he interested 
in finding out. Scared for his life, he slunk out of his house 
in the middle of the night. 
  This M.Sc. is now selling meat and chicken in Delhi's INA 
market. The rest of his family -- his parents and sisters -- 
have fled to Bangalore. 
  Vijaya Zutshi, a young mother of two girls, cooks food in 
her 
make-shift kitchen, and matter-of-factly relates her tale -- 
which could be that of any other Kashmiri Hindu family -- "My 
husband ran a courier company in Kashmir. One night, four men 
with guns knocked at our door. My husband jumped the wall and 
ran away. Next day, we all left." 
  The Zutshis are among the more fortunate families: they 
have, 
at least, a corner of the hall in the camp in Delhi's Amar 
Colony to call their own. The single men are not so lucky. They 
have to make do with as much space as their bedrolls occupy. The 
hall resembles a railway platform, except, these people have 
nowhere to go. 
  The camp in Delhi's South Extension is worse, with more than 
250 people crammed into a small hall. The only things these 
people can call their own are the walls of these camps, 
plastered over as they are with newspaper clippings of militant 
deaths in the Valley. 
  But one doesn't really need these to read the writing on the 
wall. Here are men who owned apple orchards and saffron farms 
back in the Valley, forced to steal out of their homes because 
they refused to obey the cry "Kashmir mein rehna hoga, 
Allah-ho-Akbar kehna hoga (If you want to stay in Kashmir, 
you must embrace Islam)." 
  And now, they have to make do with an average income of Rs 
1,200 to Rs 1,500 a month. That is, if the migrants are lucky 
enough to find jobs at all. Otherwise, they have to depend on a 
government dole of Rs 250 per head. Or Rs 1,000 per family, 
irrespective of its size. 
  They have been waiting for nearly four years for the 
government to do something about their lot. "All that we have 
got is indifference and apathy," burst out Ashok Barbazoor 
angrily. Barbazoor worked for 21 years at the Oberoi Hotel in 
Srinagar, and claims he earned nearly Rs 10,000 a month. Now, he 
sits idle. "I burnt Pakistani flags in Jammu, and now I am 
paying the price for my nationalism. All I have to say is 
'Pakistan, zindabad', and I will get my house and 
land back." 
  It's the kind of experience that is at the bottom of all the 
knee-jerk bigotism in the country. "So much hue and cry over one 
mosque being brought down here," sneered Barbazoor. "What about 
all the Hindu temples that were burnt in Kashmir? This 
government wants to show it is a democratic one, and so is 
pandering to the minorities." 
  Alleged S. L. Shakhdar, chairman of the action committee 
group, Kashmir Samiti, "There is discrimination even among the 
refugees here, with the Kashmiri Pandits getting a raw deal. The 
Punjab migrants get a dole of Rs 300 per head. And the Afghani 
refugees get Rs 700 per head, from the Indian government, in 
addition to Rs 800 from the United Nations." 
  "For so long, the government has been saying 'We'll send you 
back,' and doing nothing but mollycoddling the terrorists," said 
one refugee. "Look what happened in Hazratbal. They set the 
militants free in the stealth of the night." "If they can't give 
us back our land," cried another, "we will take guns and fight 
for it." His cry was echoed by the surrounding Kashmiri Pandit 
youths: "Train us to fight and we will solve our own problems." 
  Another solution being advocated is the one for a separate 
homeland for Kashmiri Pandits. This demand comes loudest from 
the Panun Kashmir Group (founded in 1991). Explained its 
chairman, Dr Agni Shekhar, "Panun means 'our'. We are 
asking for our homeland, a place where Pandits will be safe and 
can call their home." 
  Realising the improbability of the militants ever leaving 
the 
Valley, the organisation is asking for a homeland comprising the 
regions of the Valley to the east and north of the river Jhelum. 
  In addition, they want the homeland to be accorded the 
status 
of a Union Territory, under the Constitution of India but minus 
the controversial Article 370, which has been applicable to the 
rest of the state since November 1952. 
  "Panun Kashmir is a translation of our aspirations," said Dr 
Agni Shekhar. Added Dr Ajay Chungroo, spokesman for Panun 
Kashmir, "Over three lakh Kashmiri Pandits were pushed out of 
the Valley. We deserve a home, and by concentrating us in a 
particular part of the Valley, it will be easier for the 
government to protect us as well." 
  Gautam Kaul, DIG Personnel, Central Industrial Security 
Force 
agreed: "The demand for a separate homeland must be seen in its 
totality," he said. "It is the demand of despair. And it would 
not have come if the central government had not ignored the 
entire issue. Having a patch of sterilised area free from 
militants is a simple way of solving the situation." 
  But the migrants in the camps do not take to the idea of a 
separate homeland. "What they are asking for is a division of 
Kashmir. This means that Kashmir is lost to us," said Raina. 
Added Barbazoor, "It is not possible to live in isolation by 
asking for a strip of land. We have to interact both 
professionally and socially with our immediate neighbours. How 
can we exist in a vacuum?" 
  While the Panun Kashmir members shrug off the migrants' 
point 
of view ("They have orchards and property all over the Valley 
and so, don't want to be restricted to a particular area," 
explained one Panun Kashmiri), others, like former Governor of 
Jammu and Kashmir, Girish C. Saxena, concur with their argument 
against a separate homeland. 
  "The idea (of a separate homeland) does not take into 
account 
the realities of the situation," said Saxena. "One can 
understand their frustration and despair, but the foundation of 
the return of the Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley can only be on 
the basis of goodwill and welcome by the majority community in 
the Valley. And this can only be established through government 
negotiations." 
  He went on to caution, "These negotiations take time. Even 
in 
Punjab, thousands of people and industries were displaced, but 
eventually they have all gone back to their own homes." 
  It is ironic that Panun Kashmir, an organisation that claims 
to be voicing their demands, did not take their views into 
account when it asked for a separate homeland. "And what is 
worse, they are spending lakhs of rupees hosting a world 
conference, when they could have distributed the money among the 
refugees," said Barbazoor. (Panun Kashmir claims it is funded by 
its branches in America and Europe, and by various Kashmiri 
Pandits in India as well.) 
  Agni Shekhar rose to his organisation's defence: "It is 
necessary to hold conferences to highlight our problems. Also, 
our organisation is not for meeting day-to-day needs, but has a 
long-term goal." 
  As for the day-to-day needs, "The migrants do have some sort 
of a cushion to fall back on in the form of the camps," said 
Saxena. "True, these can be improved upon, but these people all 
come from an affluent background, and so their expectations are 
much more than what is being provided." 
  The Kashmir Samiti, which manages most of the refugee camps, 
has helped in looking for employment. Out of the 10,000 families 
in the 17 Delhi camps, around 3,000 people are working as sales 
agents, teachers, engineers and even shopkeepers (Delhi's INA 
market is full of Kashmiri migrants-turned-shopkeepers). 
  Vijaya Zutshi's husband works as a school-teacher, earning 
Rs 
3,000 a month. "In Kashmir," she said wistfully, "we had two 
houses. Now we have to make do with his small salary." 
  Some philosophical souls are more than making do. A few 
stray 
lay-abouts are already in evidence. Happy with the government 
dole and whatever part-time employment that comes their way, 
they loiter around the camps, dressed in not-so-old sweaters and 
trousers and talking about the latest Hindi moves. These youths 
have also found their own alternate lifestyles in exile. 
  In the meantime, the government needs to step up its 
rehabilitation programmes. "There should be relaxation of age to 
all dispossessed migrants," pointed out Gautam Kaul, "to 
compensate for two years' loss in education. Let them treat us 
like Scheduled Tribes." 
  This is the other aspect of the mass exodus of the Pandits 
from the Valley: the cultural and social loss to the nation. 
According to Vijay Tikku, Panun Kashmir member, "Modern Kashmir 
owes a lot, particularly in the fields of literature, art and 
dialect -- its very Kashmiriyat -- to the Kashmiri 
Hindus. The Pandits in Kashmir go back over 5,000 years. Our 
language, the Sharda language, is the oldest regional language 
in India." 
  Although the Valley, which accounts for 3,000 square miles 
in 
a state comprising 84,000 square miles, is predominantly 
inhabited by Muslims, there is little difference in the language 
and dress of the Hindus and Muslims residing there. But now the 
Kashmiri Hindus are claiming that since they were the original 
inhabitants of Kashmir, they are responsible for its cultural 
identity. "The Muslims in the Valley have adopted the Sharda 
language. If the Pandits do not return, then the original Sharda 
script will become influenced by Pushto and Afghani dialects," 
laments Kaul. 
  In order to hold on to their Kashmiriyat, the 
migrants have been making paintings, sculptures, writing 
Kashmiri folk songs -- resulting in what they term "art in 
exile". "With these paintings and creative literature, we want 
to tell the rest of India, 'This is the community you have 
killed'," said Agni Shekhar. 
  Four years after the debacle in their lives, the Kashmiri 
Pandits languish in their camps, but not without a desperate bid 
to go home.

<F P=106> [Article by V.P. Bhatia: "From Arm-Twisting to Leg-Twisting </F>
of India Over Kashmir"] 
  [Text] In his The Story of Philosophy, rated as 
"one of the best loved works of our time", the celebrated 
American author Will Durant relates the following incident from 
the life of a Roman philosopher Epictetus as a classic example 
of stoicism or quiet acceptance of pain and defeat as one's 
pre-ordained lot in life: "Story has it that Epictetus' master, 
who treated him with consistent cruelty, one day took to 
twisting Epictetus' leg to pass the time away. `If you go on', 
said Epictetus calmly, `you will break my leg'. But the master 
went on, and the leg was broken. `Did I not tell you', said 
Epictetus mildly, "that you would break my leg?" And that was 
the end of the matter. [quotation marks as published] 
  It is some such sort of mystic philosophy of tolerance, we 
are told by historians, that the Hindus had been practising in 
medieval times to survive the Islamic onslaught. And it is again 
some such sort of secular philosophy of surrender to Islamic 
subversion and crossborder terrorism that the nation is being 
advised to put up with in order to prove our civilisational 
superiority to Islamic theo-political offensive again so that 
our rulers can enjoy the fruits of freedom in undisturbed calm 
even while bartering away vital national interests at every step. 
  However, to cover up rank cowardice, mealy-mouthed sermons 
are delivered to the nation, reminding one of a heartless 
judge's advice to rape-victims that when they can't do anything 
about rape, it is better to relax and enjoy it! 
  No wonder, as the self-serving secular hypocrisy strikes 
more 
and more weird poses of servility, Pakistan's arm-twisting of 
India turns to leg-twisting. As the wager of Islamic 
jehad is fully backed and encouraged by its 
patron-in-chief with a new cowboy, Bill Clinton, in White House, 
the proxy war threatens to take the shape of an atomic holocaust 
of India unless the secularists offer the whole of Kashmir on a 
platter to propitiate the Islamic Moloch. It is another matter 
that the people of India are still quite capable of facing the 
multiple threats. 
  Obviously and no Government even offers to surrender Kashmir 
unless bent on hara-kiri. But then you can bank on 
secularists to devise new foxy ways of covering up surrender 
under grandiose terms like "autonomy" and "self-administration", 
as the secular opinion-makers and writers mount a surreptitious 
pro-Paki and pro-American campaign for "timely solution" of 
Kashmir problem to avoid disintegration of India, although such 
a "solution" would hasten disintegration. 
  So we are told by Kuldip Nayar in his column in THE 
STATESMAN 
(December 29, 1993): Fortunately there is a sea-change in Indian 
opinion. Whether it is because of unending militancy or the 
growing feeling that force is no solution to people's 
alienation, the climate in India is in favour of making 
concessions provided it does not mean the secession of the 
Valley. There is also the realisation that the country cannot 
progress without peace in the continent." [quotation marks as 
published] 
  The so-called opinion-makers are obviously happy that the 
secular gangs have successfully alienated the Kashmiris and now 
urge de facto "Azadi" for them. After expulsion of all Hindus 
they are all for creating a new Islamic nation. So why not cut 
the head to get rid of the chronic headache. 
  This reminds one of Urdu poet Ghalib's oft-quoted verse: 
  Ab to ghabra ke yeh kehtay hai ke mar jayen ge, Mar ke bhi 
chain na paya to kidhar jayen ge. 
  -- That is, "In a fit of life's frustrations, we yearn to 
seek escape in death, but where shall we go if even death does 
not bring the coveted peace." 
  So what if even a constitutional regression in Kashmir from 
the quasi-independent status of Article 370 to semi-independent 
status of Nehru-Abdullah agreement of 1952 or three-subject 
accession of October 1947 does not prove to be the final 
solution? What if the crusaders continue the battle for full 
Islamic independence and accession to Pakistan of which there 
should be no doubt if one remembers what even Nehru had said 
that Kashmir is only a symptom of Pakistan's religious disease 
and it will find some other pretext to badger India if it gets 
it on a platter. Even Kuldip Nayar has reported in his book 
Distant Neighbours, that Hate India is the very basic 
creed of Pakistan and superiority of Islam and hatred of Hindus 
as kafirs the very sheet anchor of its existence. 
  However, just now the stand of the worshippers of terrorist 
force and opinion-makers like Nayar that "climate in India is 
favourable for making concessions" because of "unending 
militancy" is no different from Bhutto Government's at the 
recent Indo-Pakistan talks in Islamabad that India should 
"swallow the bitter pill" of secession of Kashmir because of 
"changed ground realities" -- changed by the Pakistan-directed 
proxy war, of course. The only difference between two stands is 
that while Pakistan wants to amputate the leg, the Indian 
secularists would like to keep it dangling to the Indian body 
after breaking it. 
  Many would however call it head-hunting if you remember that 
Kashmir is always projected as the head of Bharat Mata. 
Meanwhile, the progress of arm-twisting to leg-twisting to 
head-hunting by Pakistan and its American godfathers forms a 
great success story of Nehruvian secularism, which though a 
totally failed remedy, is being administered with ever bigger 
doses to the sick nation. 
  There is much song and dance, meanwhile, that China has 
changed its stand of all-out support to Pakistan on Kashmir 
issue whereas fact is China is against only the third option of 
independent status of Kashmir as it would become an American 
base against it, otherwise it has forged even stronger defence 
ties with Pakistan to checkmate India. Besides supplying 
missiles, it has pushed lakhs of AK-47 rifles at damn cheap 
rates for terrorists' use in the region. Clinton's controversial 
letter to Ghulam Nabi Fai, President of a pro-militant and 
pro-Pakistan Kashmiri outfit of USA, is no less significant as 
it makes the American stand all the more a pro-Pakistan. So now 
you may hear more hue and cry on Plebiscite and 
self-determination even in UNO. 
  However, the real solution of the problem still lies in the 
hands of India, only if it sheds the secular blinkers. There 
will be no respite to it unless it learns to look grim realities 
in the face. The back of secessionist militancy has to be broken 
swiftly and ruthlessly, even as Pakistan did in Baluchistan even 
by bombing of rebel areas. But the pity is that the Centre goes 
about everything touching Muslim intransigence in a 
circumlocutory and dilatory fashion, painfully prolonging the 
agony of everybody by avoiding the hammer-stroke of determined 
army action, without political interference. 
  What is needed is a clear signal to Pakistan that it would 
destroy itself if it insists on annexing Kashmir. For 
Kashmir-fixation is bound to spell the destruction of Pakistan, 
whatever the price India has to pay for its nuclear toys. A dire 
signal is also needed for Kashmiri politicians to agree to full 
integration by abrogation of Article 370 or face imposition of 
Union Territory status for the valley and merger of the rest of 
the state to Punjab and Himachal. In any case, militancy in the 
state is kept alive as much by Pakistan as by the pampered 
crypto Pakistanis of the valley. This phoney secularism needs to 
be unmasked and secessionism punished instead of being rewarded 
with massive bribes. 
  In any case, people of India will never accept what Kuldip 
Nayar dubs as public opinion but is really the official opinion. 
India has to stop behaving as "a poorman's wife who is the 
common property of all neighbours". For that is the unenviable 
status "progressively" achieved by India since the leftist 
inspired Chinese aggression of 1962. The outraged nation's 
long-oppressed spirits are waiting to be uplifted with a 
cataclysmic fury. There are enough silver-linings in the dark 
clouds. 
  Till then, Pakistan's spirits are hugely uplifted by the 
Dutch courage of its nuclear toys. 
  Meanwhile, Pakistan's notorious secret agency ISI is 
operating freely from our territory, treating the whole of India 
right up to Assam and other states in the North-east as its 
happy hunting ground and creating secure bases in all big cities 
to set off new serial blasts. Using even Bangladesh and Nepal 
and maybe Sri Lanka also, it has given the latest signal of its 
omnipresence from Hyderabad in the south where a big gang 
engaged in another dangerous plot, a foretaste of which was 
given by five train explosions on December 6 last, the first 
anniversary of Ayodhya demolition, is said to have been busted 
by Indian intelligence. 
  Meanwhile, despite all hue and cry about ISI's [Pakistani 
Intelligence Service] hand in the last March's mayhem in Bombay, 
Pakistan is not the least harmed or bothered about our impotent 
rage. On the other hand, it accuses our own politicians of being 
hand in glove with the arch culprits, Dawood and Memon brothers 
who are alleged to have been allowed to escape soon after the 
car bomb blasts of which clear hints were available by unusual 
activity on the preceding night. So like Dogberry and Verges, 
the classic models of stupid policemen in Shakespeare's 
Much Ado About Nothing, the Congress regime seems to 
be happy to be rid of the botheration of arresting the villains 
of the piece. While the suspicious of politician-mafia nexus is 
strengthened by the Sharad Pawar-Chavan tussle over the handing 
over of the whole enquiry to the centre, the sense of relief 
over the villains' timely exit seems to be palpable. It is such 
stuff that Indian secularism is made of. 
  No wonder, the Pakistanis, apart from our own 
crypto-Pakistanis are the most ardent admirers of our 
self-defeating secularism. A Pakistani editor actually expressed 
surprise over this strange phenomenon. Perhaps he did not know 
how the visiting Mohajirs themselves have been feeling green 
with jealousy at the licence enjoyed by their co-religionists 
whose leaders never tire of wailing about genocide of Muslims in 
India even while claiming five to eight-fold increase in their 
population since independence as against three-fold increase in 
general. They also have reason to gloat over the ethnic purge of 
Hindus from Kashmir even while welcoming massive infiltration 
from Bangladesh to inflate their vote-bank. 
  Meanwhile, to frighten the Hindu population in general and 
pseudo-secularists they keep threatening the Bosaniasation of 
the whole of India by communal flareups, bomb-blasts, terrorist 
violence on the plea that the Muslim youth was getting impatient 
of constitutional ways. 
  No wonder, the hard-pressed Hindus administered a shock 
therapy by way of demolition of the Islamic imperialist totem at 
Ayodhya. More shocks treatments may follow as a logical 
corollary if the Islamic sins go on piling up further with 
secular connivance. Their BSP-SP [Bahujan Samaj Party-Samajwadi 
Party] Trojan horses are unlikely to help them as the Hindu 
psyche is basically the same in this matter among the backwards, 
forwards and the Dalits. 
  No wonder, even intellectual giants like V. S. Naipaul and 
Nirad Chaudhuri have welcomed it as a Hindu mass upsurge. This 
reminds one of Huxley's description of D. H. Lawrence's attack 
on conventional morality in Lady Chatterley's Lover 
as shock treatment. The hue and cry raised over it, said Huxley, 
showed that it had successfully gone home. So, he urged more and 
more such shocks so that now we find no modern novel respectable 
without fierce attacks on "Grundyism". 
  Thus it is that the Hindu temperature rises as Islamic 
votebank is relentlessly propitiated and appeased with ever new 
baits despite a clear writing on the wall about its 
fundamentalist mission. And again, thus it is that every 
Pakistani blackmail and breach of diplomatic norms is swallowed 
as mother's milk by our philosopher-kings despite open 
declarations of Jehad not only to annex Kashmir but 
to terrorise and blow-up the rest of India. For, to finish the 
unfinished business of partition, is their openly proclaimed 
aim. And as co-fathers and creators of the Islamic state of 
Pakistan, with touching paternal love for its stability and 
welfare, our Congress rulers treat even its most dangerous moves 
as no worse than the pranks of a spoilt child.

<F P=106> [Interview with Murli Manohar Joshi, former president of BJP </F>
(Bharatiya Janata Party), on 5 January; place not given: 
"Government Has Allowed Internationalization of Kashmir Issue"] 
  [Text] When I went to Srinagar to hoist the National Flag 
there the Islamic fundamentalist terrorists had infiltrated even 
into the administrative machinery of J&amp;K [Jammu and Kashmir] 
government. They had established a large number of training 
centres, and they had also attracted the imagination of a large 
number of young people who were constantly interacting with 
Pakistan. Some of them demanded Independence, some others wanted 
to merge J&amp;K with Pakistan. Normal life had been disturbed, 
terrorism was in full swing and the authority of the Indian 
government had completely eroded. I thought that in a part of 
our own country, in Kashmir Valley, people, Kashmiri Hindus, 
have been squeezed out of their hearths and homes and rendered 
homeless. What is this government sitting in Delhi and Srinagar? 
How is it that the government has lost the sensitivity to react 
to the situations? There is no concern for those unfortunate but 
patriotic people. All the political leaders heard the slogans of 
Pakistan zindabad... "Indian dogs get out of the 
Valley", and other anti-India outpourings. The posters carrying 
such slogans were appearing on the walls. Then there was a 
massive anti-India propaganda, hate-India campaign on Kashmir 
all over the world. Our security forces were painted one of the 
most inhuman forces, brute forces violating all human rights. 
The government in New Delhi was pumping money, crores, hundreds 
of crores in Kashmir Valley. But despite all this generosity 
nobody could dare personally go and hoist the National Flag in 
Srinagar any day -- Independence Day or Republic Day. A certain 
feeling and sense of despondency was descending on the people of 
Jammu and Laddakh also as there was nobody to raise a little 
finger against the terrorists. Therefore, the Party (the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party]) decided that I should go to Srinagar 
and hoist the National Flag in order to emphasise India's basic 
unity and integrity. We wanted to tell the whole world that 
India is indivisible. 
  You cannot say that this is Kashmir, this is this, this is 
that. These divisions are for administrative set up but 
culturally, emotionally and historically, India, including 
Kashmir, is one. As I discovered during the Ekta Yatra, even in 
the remotest corner down south the sentiment on Kashmir is same 
as in the rest of the country -- north, east or west. The main 
objective of the Ekta Yatra was to emphasise this positive side 
of the Kashmir problem and to educate the people about the harm 
and damage which was done by retaining all these years Article 
370 which has sowed the seeds of separatism. 
  My analysis was that the major problem arises because of 
this 
Article under which Kashmir appears to have been given a 
separate status, separate from other States. The continuance of 
the Article was responsible for separatism in Kashmir, said Shri 
Murli Manohar Joshi, former President of BJP, in an interview to 
ORGANISER on his sixtieth birthday, January 5. 
  Excerpts. 
  [Question] The government is having talks with Pakistan on 
Kashmir. what is your view about it? 
  [Answer] Regrettably the government has not acted wisely in 
handling Kashmir affairs and has provided a handle to 
separatist, anti-India elements in Kashmir. The most unfortunate 
part of government's policy (on Kashmir) is that Kashmir which 
was only a bilateral matter, under the Shimla Pact, has been 
allowed to become an international issue. Now, many countries 
are coming and trying to sponsor their services to mediate and 
United States and some of its representatives have even 
questioned the accession of Kashmir State to the Indian Union. 
They say that entire Kashmir is a disputed territory. This is 
because Government of India could not initiate talks with 
Pakistan. The GOI should have forced Pakistan to the negotiating 
table and asked for withdrawal of Pakistani forces from the 
occupied Kashmir as provided under UN resolutions. The UNCIP 
appointed by UNO had held that the accession was legal and valid. 
  [Question] You mean UN resolution also called for withdrawal 
of pakistani Army from PoK? 
  [Answer] Yes. But GOI never demanded the withdrawal of 
Pakistani forces. 
  [Question] What would you suggest? Should the government 
hold 
talks? 
  [Answer] Talks or no talks...that is not the issue. Well, 
first GOI should be in a position to create a favourable world 
opinion. All those countries which were supporting India till 
now have become non-interested. Even Russia which was extending 
blanket support in the past has withdrawn. Now, once you accept 
that Kashmir is a disputed territory, what about Sikkim? China 
does not think it is part of India. Arunachal also, China feels, 
is not a part of India. This is a design to destabilise India. 
Therefore, the basic question is that of country's integrity. 
  [Question] Against this background what do you think can be 
a 
solution? 
  [Answer] There are so many options being talked about. Some 
say, give Kashmir more autonomy, some feel borders should be 
made more porous. Some say Valley should be put under 
international control for some years. Some are thinking of 
independent Kashmir, some say that let Kashmir go to Pakistan. 
All sorts of solutions are coming up. These solutions are being 
talked about because the GOI has shown weakness in handling the 
Kashmir issue all these years. Had it dealt with the issue 
firmly there would have been no Kashmir problem today. 
  [Question] The situation being so alarming, has the Party 
any 
other immediate plank on Kashmir? 
  [Answer] Yes, I feel the soul of India must be stirred once 
again. To remain quiet on the new U.S. stance on the issue will 
be suicidal. Due to elections and other reasons the reaction of 
GOI was not so sharp as it should have been. 
  [Question] It is said that Hazratbal episode gave BJP a very 
good chance to bring the Kashmir issue to the fore but BJP 
wasted it? 
  [Answer] As I have told you, there were elections at that 
time. But still, all through the election campaign we focussed 
on Kashmir and told the people of government's surrender to 
militants.

  [Text] Jammu--Union Home Minister S.B. Chavan has said that 
Pakistan, which has been supporting and instigating terrorism in 
Kashmir, has no moral right to raise the issue of alleged human 
rights abuses by security forces in the Kashmir valley. 
  Talking to newsmen at the Jammu airport before his departure 
to Delhi after his three-day tour of Jammu and Doda region, 
Chavan said that Pakistan has launched a massive disinformation 
campaign against India at the international level, whereas 
large-scale human rights violations are taking place in other 
parts of Pakistan, he said. 
  The Union Home Minister admitted that India has not been 
able 
to effectively counter the false and motivated campaign by 
Pakistan. He said that the government has taken a number of 
steps to put across the Indian point of view on the Kashmir 
issue at the international level. 
  "We even propose to send non-government organisations to 
other countries to put across our case in the wake of "wild 
allegations levelled against our country," he said. 
  Chavan further said that after the strike call given by the 
Pakistan government on the Kashmir issue no further proof was 
needed to show the complicity of Pakistan in fomenting trouble 
in the Kashmir valley. 
  On the question of alleged use of excessive force at 
Kupwara, 
Chavan said that clear-cut instructions have been given to the 
security forces to show utmost restraint in dealing with such 
provocative situations. He said that an inquiry has been ordered 
by army into the episode also. 
  Asked about the demand for appointing political advisors 
Chavan categorically said, "We do not propose to appoint 
political advisors." He said that Kashmir was a national issue 
and he would expect co-operation from all political parties to 
frame a common "strategy." No political party should try to 
exploit it for its "political gains," he added. 
  About holding elections in the state, the Home Minister said 
that he has never ruled out holding elections in Jammu and 
Kashmir but no time limit could be given. 
  Chavan said that he did meet Farooq Abdullah in Delhi for 
half-an-hour but refused to give further details about what 
transpired. 
  He also announced that the monthly relief to the Kashmiri 
migrants has been raised from Rs.1000 per month to Rs.1500 per 
month. "The decision was taken after I had a talk with the Union 
Finance Minister Manmohan Singh on telephone last evening," he 
said. 
  He said that he would also take up with the Finance Ministry 
the problems of overdraft, deficit and security related 
expenditure incurred by the state government. He further said 
that unless more aid was given to the J and K it would be 
difficult for the state to meet its annual plan targets. 
  About his perception of the situation, he said that security 
forces are handling it in a co-ordinated manner which has not 
only given confidence to the government but also to the common 
man." 
  Asked to comment upon the reported statement of Pakistan 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that Kashmir would soon be part of 
Pakistan, he retored, "It is their wish only."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Home Minister's Visit to Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] It would be unrealistic to hope that Home Minister 
Chavan's visit to Kashmir to review the situation there would 
improve the law and order situation and that terrorism would be 
controlled. The firing by the terrorists on the home minister's 
caravan in Doda proves that the roots of terrorism are very deep 
in Jammu-Kashmir. Chavan, who visited Jammu and Doda, said that 
he felt the people there wanted to join the national mainstream, 
but are afraid to speak because of their fear of rifles. The 
central leaders have been making such statements continuously 
for the last three years. After their trips to Jammu-Kashmir, 
the central leaders always conclude that the people there do not 
support the terrorists, but are afraid of revenge and lack the 
courage to speak up. The question arises: Whose job is it to 
take away the guns that are aimed at these people's heads? Who 
is responsible for arresting the terrorists? If it is the 
government, then what is the use of making such statements? Do 
not government officials understand that they are sending the 
wrong message to the Kashmiri people by telling them we are 
helpless, and that we do want to help them, but are not strong 
enough to deal with the terrorists? The image that is presented 
to the world is that India has no influence here, and the people 
here want to get out of India. This is the image that Pakistan 
presents to Western and Muslim nations. The home minister said 
that the government is willing to talk with the Huriat 
Conference and other separatist groups on the condition that 
they give up violence and be prepared to talk according to the 
Indian Constitution. We do not know who the home minister is 
trying to fool. The groups that thrive on the belief of 
separatism and who believe in violence and military methods will 
not accept the home minister's condition and be prepared to 
commit suicide. 
  Chavan said that the attractiveness of terrorism was 
increased because these youths were unemployed. Therefore, the 
government would increase opportunities for employment. This is 
also looking away from reality. Even if we grant that 
unemployment is a cause for increasing violence, how can we 
provide opportunities for employment in this atmosphere of 
violence and anarchy? In Jammu-Kashmir, especially in the 
Kashmir Valley, administration is in name only. All business is 
idle, and industrial production has stopped fully. Government 
and non-government offices do nominal work, and two years of 
education in schools and colleges is not completed even in five 
years. No industrialist is willing to invest money in the state. 
Even the home minister himself has admitted that foreign 
contractors responsible for building the hydroelectric project 
in Dulhasti have given up the project out of their fear of 
violence. In this atmosphere, what kind of miracle will Chavan, 
Rajesh Pilot, or Farooq Abdullah pull to create new jobs? The 
only miracle they can pull is to silence the guns of the 
terrorists. But the preliminary preparations the government 
should have made have never been done. The local and central 
police are in a precarious condition, while the terrorists have 
spread their communication network all over the state. In this 
situation, the security forces' efforts to rout the terrorists 
are like chasing their own shadows. Usually, innocent citizens 
suffer in these efforts. Until the central government gives up 
its much-abused cliches and forms an effective strategy to end 
the anarchy in Kashmir, it will not be able to get out of this 
mess, nor will it be able to show a path to the people.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Drawing the Line of </F>
Control"] 
  [Text] Once again Kashmir has become a centre of utmost 
concern both at home and abroad. The latest focal point of the 
Kashmir crisis is the border township of Kupwara where an army 
operation against militants led to the killing of about 30 
persons. This in turn led to the bandh called by the 
civilian population which described the operation as a 
"massacre" by the Indian Army. Government offices, business 
establishments, banks, post offices and shops were closed 
throughout the valley--one more proof of the alienation of the 
people from the Indian government. 
  This has come as a severe blow for the Centre. Its isolation 
in the trouble torn valley has been exposed just when the 
Pakistan government is likely to raise the issue of human rights 
violations by India's security forces in Kashmir at the session 
of the United Nations human rights commission which began 
yesterday. 
  Now more than at any other time, the record on human rights 
is certainly negative for India. In the early Sixties, there was 
a direct diplomatic offensive by the United Kingdom-United 
States combine leading to the Duncan Sandys mission that bluntly 
advocated the vivisection of Kashmir. But the crisis that time 
was not triggered off by any armed secessionist movement within 
Kashmir. It arose from India's disastrous confrontation with 
China over the border dispute leading to armed aggression by the 
Chinese army. Pakistan, in concert with its international 
patrons at the time, sought to exploit India's isolation on the 
international plane. 
  In contrast, this time the near total isolation of India 
within the Kashmir valley itself is being exploited by Pakistan. 
Unlike the situation in 1962-63, this time the key to any 
solution of the Kashmir crisis lies with India to a large extent. 
  It is well worth noting the drift that has overtaken the 
Indian government's Kashmir policy in the last one year. One can 
question with good reason if the present government has a 
Kashmir policy at all. Three months ago, New Delhi's stand was 
that there had to be an Indo-Pakistani dialogue for a real 
solution of the Kashmir crisis. It was argued that unless the 
training and arming of the militant secessionists was stopped 
there could be no solution. Normalcy in the Kashmir depended on 
an Indo-Pakistani understanding. 
  Against this background, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao's message 
of 
greetings to Ms. Benazir Bhutto on the occasion of her becoming 
prime minister in October 1993 and the latter's friendly 
response were thought to be positive signs the Kashmir problem 
could begin to be tackled. 
  Then came the protracted siege of the Hazratbal shrine by 
the 
Indian Army. It showed up an amazing lack of coordination and 
common understanding among the various arms of the government 
right at the ground level. This could hardly be papered over by 
official denials. In fact, the full story of the Hazratbal 
episode has not yet come to light, particularly the manner of 
its settlement. 
  Nevertheless the resolution of the Hazratbal issue opened up 
new possibilities for some initiatives both at home and abroad. 
In Kashmir itself, the emergence of the Hurriyat outfit aiming 
to bring about a rapprochement between the government and the 
militant groups offered a golden opportunity. For the government 
could find a new approach to solve the problem within Kashmir 
itself. 
  But the opportunity was not used. Instead, the army was 
given 
the go-ahead to launch a military strike against the militants. 
The Sopore operation destroyed the chances for any dialogue with 
the militants. The government itself did not seem unified in its 
assessment of the way to handle the Kashmir crisis. 
  On one side is the hardline lobby that frankly takes the 
stand of no-truck whatsoever with the militants. This school 
thinks that the militants can be wiped out and thereafter the 
people in the valley brought over to the side of the 
authorities. There is another school within the government, or 
rather the political establishment, which realises there can be 
no solution to the Kashmir crisis through mere armed action. It 
stresses the need for political initiatives. 
  Undoubtedly nowhere in history has an insurgency been 
quelled 
by sheer force. The military can only contain militancy, not 
eliminate it. However, New Delhi seems to be caught in a dilemma 
of its own making. It is trying to handle the most explosive of 
all its problems without having worked out a clear policy. It 
has been trying to respond to events rather than initiate any 
policy decision. 
  A careful analysis of New Delhi's reactions to events in 
Kashmir in the last one year makes it clear that the government 
has largely depended on the US administration to pull up 
Pakistan and force it to curb its aggressive designs on India. 
This dependence is based on the premise that since the Cold War 
is over, New Delhi cannot be accused of relying on Moscow. Since 
the government has also been making a thorough effort to 
dismantle the Nehruvian legacy of economic self reliance and 
openly inviting US corporate giants to invest in this country 
and capture even the home market, it expected an era of bonhomie 
between the two countries. 
  The finance minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, has assiduously 
pursued a policy of total subservience to the World Bank 
prescription of free market economics. He naturally expected 
this to fetch political dividends. This anticipation has 
dominated the government's entire thinking on international 
affairs. But the assumption Washington would recognise India's 
worth as its largest loyal camp follower in south Asia was naive. 
  An illusion was also fostered that the US administration 
would listen more to New Delhi than to Islamabad on any issue of 
contention between India and Pakistan. That was why greater 
labour was spent by Indian diplomats and the government to 
canvass for India's case on Kashmir in Washington than make any 
serious attempt to open a worthwhile dialogue with its neighbour. 
  Even when US state department underlings like Mr. John 
Mallot 
and Ms. Raphel made offensive remarks about India's position in 
Kashmir, the Indian government held on to the illusion it would 
be able to persuade Washington to brand Pakistan as a "terrorist 
state". Instead came the two missives from the US president, Mr. 
Bill Clinton, to two non-descripts. This clearly showed his bias 
for the militants not only in Kashmir but in Punjab as well. 
  What seems to be totally missed by policy making pundits in 
New Delhi is that the US administration has never claimed to be 
a Santa Claus distributing goodies to third world destitutes. It 
has always maintained its realpolitik for mastery 
over international affairs and economics, more so after the 
collapse of its rival superpower, the former Soviet Union. It 
has never made the mistake of announcing the abandonment of its 
aspirations to world hegemony. In that design, the emergence of 
a stable, powerful India can only be a nightmare rather than a 
benign force. 
  An unstable India in constant friction with its neighbours 
provides the ideal setting for Washington's policy on south 
Asia. At the tactical level, Indian diplomats should have 
realised the present prime minister of Pakistan has long 
maintained the closest relations with the Democrats in the US. 
This relationship enabled her to work out a businesslike 
relationship with the powerful military junta in Pakistan which 
has never snapped its close links with the Pentagon. 
  Given this alignment of forces, any government in New Delhi 
has to try its hardest to open a dialogue with the militants in 
Kashmir. They should be offered autonomy short of secession from 
the Indian Union. To discuss and negotiate there has to be a 
ceasefire. Dialogues with all groups of Kashmiris have to 
include representatives of the refugee intelligentsia as well. 
  And once the Indian government plucks up the courage to make 
such an offer to Kashmiris who are citizens of India whether 
they are militants or not, it can be in a position to call upon 
its Pakistani counterpart to make a similar offer to Kashmiris 
on the Pakistani side of the line of control. This would 
represent a healthy competition between the two countries to win 
over the hearts of the inhabitants of paradise on earth.

  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 1--The recent killing of the first 
non-combatant officer in Kashmir and last week's incident at 
Kupwara are part of a conspiracy to embarrass India at the U.N. 
Human Rights meet which opens in Geneva today, according to 
senior officials here. 
  The slaying last month of the Border Roads Organisations 
[BRO] officer, Major Bhupinder Singh, is seen as an attempt to 
provoke a violent response from the security forces which could 
then be denounced before a global audience at Geneva, as proof 
of India's disrespect for human rights. 
  "After February 15 when the global spotlight from Geneva 
wears thin, the violence here is bound to taper off," said a 
highly-placed source. 
  Returning alone (unlike other uniformed personnel, BRO 
officers often travel without an armed escort) after supervising 
road clearing in snow bound Kashmir, Major Singh was waylaid 
near Verinag on January 17. His bullet-riddled body was dumped 
by the roadside the following Sunday. It also bore visible marks 
of torture. 
  Outraged peers call the slaying "the grossest violation of 
human rights." Fellow officers recall Major Singh's obsession 
with pushing road building in the Himalayas, a perfectly 
civilian friendly activity. With three road building projects in 
the troubled State, the BRO is a major employer in the region. 
  The young Sikh officer with an infectious sense of humour 
was 
a daredevil who preferred to travel alone, his colleagues say. 
"When will the locals with whom he was so friendly break their 
silence and with it the militants will to heap atrocities," they 
ask. 
  Hiding her anguish, his wife, Abnash Kaur, tries to 
reconcile 
herself to the loneliness which lies ahead. Too young to fathom 
the tragedy, daughters Nirmat (11) and Robina (7) are oblivious 
to the uncertain future they now face. Rewards varying from Rs. 
50,000 to Rs. 1 lakh have been announced to apprehend the 
culprits, one of whom has been identified. 
  Singh's colleagues say the newly-formed pro-Pakistan outfit, 
the Hizbul Ansar (made up of the Harkat Ul Mujahideen and the 
Harkat Ul Jehad-al Islami) is behind his killing. They claim 
that competition among the militants to obtain rewards from the 
Pakistan Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) could be another 
provocation for the killing. 
  Demonstration of "results" on the ground releases a flush of 
funds and weapons from across the border. When the squeeze on 
militants tightens in the winters (snow-bound passes block 
infiltration routes) brutality can reactivate support from 
outside, they point out.

<F P=106> [Article by Pran Chopra] </F>
  [Text] Is Pakistan trying to shut the door on future 
negotiations with India? That, in plain language, would be the 
meaning of the stand it has now taken on Kashmir, if it decides 
to stick by that stand. 
  It has stated that the next round of talks between the two 
countries must focus on the modalities and time schedule for 
holding a plebiscite in Kashmir. Such an agenda can be agreed 
upon between the two countries only if, and only after, they 
have agreed, at least in principle, that a plebiscite is to be 
held and the time has come to sort out the modalities. Since no 
agreement of the kind has been reached as yet and none is in 
sight, the agenda stipulated by Pakistan puts the cart before 
the horse. 
  Why has Pakistan done so? One part of its motivation is 
clear 
enough. By making such a proposal Pakistan is trying to convince 
what remains of its constituency in Kashmir that it is still 
working for the Valley's exit from India. It is also trying to 
convince the people of Pakistan that while the Mujahideen may 
have failed to tire India out of the Valley, Pakistan has not 
lost its zest for its parallel tussle with India on the 
diplomatic front. Nor has it lost diplomatic initiative despite 
India making the first move in suggesting a substantial and 
constructive agenda for the next round of talks between the two 
countries. 
  There is very little India can or needs to do about this 
part 
of Pakistan's game plan. It is a matter which lies between 
Pakistan on the one hand and on the other those who have put 
their faith in Pakistan's ability to undo, by one means or 
another, the State's accession to India. India can only wait 
while they come to terms with the realities. India's concern 
needs to be more with what Pakistan may be attempting to convey 
to the United States by these tactics. 
  What Pakistan is seeking to do at that level is to blackmail 
the United States and other peace-makers into putting further 
pressure on India on its behalf, and by that means to scare 
India into making further concessions quickly in order to spare 
itself the pain of these pressures. This is a subtler game than 
Pakistan has played so far, which makes it all the more 
necessary for India to avoid either of the two opposite kinds of 
diplomatic fumbling, one by showing too much flexibility and the 
other by showing too little. Too much would only whet the 
appetite of Pakistan and the secessionists, too little would 
narrow the opportunities which have opened up in Kashmir thanks 
to the recent successes in the fight against terrorism. 
  The blackmail Pakistan is attempting may seem to be 
convoluted. But its logic is quite simple, and it may well 
persuade those decision-makers in Washington who, as recent 
events have shown, are either intentionally unfriendly or lack 
the knowledge or the patience to understand the complex 
situations in far off South Asia. 
  An important part of Washington's concern about Kashmir has 
long been known to be an outcome of its concern over the nuclear 
intentions or capability of India and Pakistan. The argument it 
puts forward is that so long as the issue of Kashmir is not 
resolved, there will always be the risk of a war between the two 
countries, and in anticipation of it each country will be 
tempted to arm itself with nuclear weapons. That will only 
aggravate the possibility that either may use them, whether 
pre-emptively or when faced with imminent defeat in a 
conventional war. 
  Pakistan is now playing judo with this argument, by using 
its 
force to flip it over and stand it on its head. It has been 
proclaiming from the highest policy-making levels--for instance 
through Mr. Moeen Qureshi when he was the Prime Minister of 
Pakistan, and much favoured by the American establishment 
because of his commitment to economic liberalisation, and more 
recently through the current Foreign Minister--that there is a 
linkage between Pakistan's nuclear policy and its demands 
regarding Kashmir. 
  More simply stated what this means is that if America is 
interested in forestalling a conventional war in South Asia 
which might escalate into a nuclear war, then it must pile more 
pressure on India until Pakistan's demands with regard to 
Kashmir are met. Reluctant as yet to go along with that, the 
United States has been urging both countries to enter into 
purposeful talks. But talks do not suit Pakistan's book. A 
deadlock does, and better still a breakdown, because then 
Pakistan can resume the game of playing upon America's anxiety 
to prevent any serious escalation of the risk of war by 
neutralising India on Kashmir. 
  India checkmated Pakistan when it not only agreed to put 
Kashmir on the agenda of the recent talks but also accepted 
Pakistan's demand that this subject be given a separate and 
pre-eminent slot. India gained some more when Pakistan admitted 
that the talks on Kashmir had been "serious." And then, even 
before that round ended, a distinct possibility arose that the 
two countries might yet put themselves on the track of 
substantial and long-term negotiations because India indicated 
its willingness to make a series of proposals, some on very 
substantial issues, and from which much good could come for both 
countries if the talks continued to be serious and purposeful 
and if Pakistan refrained from making the Indian proposals a 
hostage to its own. 
  Pakistan has now tried to stymie that chance with its demand 
that the focus of the next round of talks must be on the 
modalities of a plebiscite. Pakistan probably expects that it 
stands to gain no matter which way India moves. If India accepts 
the demand, Pakistan earns the gratitude of the secessionists. 
If India rejects it, Pakistan can proclaim that the negotiating 
exercise has been thwarted by India, and India must be subjected 
to further and perhaps terminal pressure, while Pakistan escapes 
the embarrassment of having to discuss India's six proposals. 
Pakistan is simultaneously trying to give teeth to this logic by 
stepping up military actions along the border to make it look 
more likely that the only alternative to America pressing India 
harder diplomatically would be a military conflict in South Asia. 
  Therefore it is necessary for India to move on a dual track. 
On the one hand it must prepare itself, seriously and sincerely, 
for the next round of talks. To this end it should consider 
whether there is any way it can further enrich its own 
proposals, and at the same time hold its patience if Pakistan 
insists on putting the modalities of a plebiscite on the agenda. 
If and when that item is reached there will be time enough to 
argue the absurdity of it, but it must not be India that turns 
its back on the negotiating table. 
  At the same time Indian security forces must avoid the kind 
of overreaction they committed on January 27 because it plays 
straight into the hands of Pakistan's scare tactics. 
  On the other track India must anticipate the blackmailing of 
America which Pakistan is sure to begin as soon as it can find 
an excuse to say that it is India which has brought the talks to 
a dead-end. This again will require simultaneous movement on 
many axes. Despite the insensitivity or ignorance of many in the 
American administration, and the prejudice of a few, the actual 
score on the negotiating table must be kept as clearly before as 
many Americans as may be possible. 
  This will test India's own patience also of course, and the 
competence of the lobbying agency which has just been engaged 
will have to go through an early baptism of trial under fire. 
  A tougher axis will be for the effort which must be made at 
the same time to carry conviction with America at the highest 
level, that while India will go as far as it possibly can to win 
back the confidence and allegiance of the people of the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir--especially now, when the situation on the 
ground is rather more auspicious than it was before--it will not 
place the State either at the disposal of Pakistan's ambition to 
complete what it holds to be the "unfinished task" of 
partitioning India along religious lines, nor will it make the 
State available for any next generation of strategic games that 
the United States might be cooking up, as China suspects it is, 
against the new enemy America is inventing for itself. 
  But the toughest axis is going to be the one on which India 
will have to make up its own mind on what and how it will face 
whatever it might have to face once it decides that it cannot 
bow any further to American interests or prejudices. 
  India has already seen on the economic front that even a 
good 
policy like deregulation of the economy can do much harm if it 
has to be tailored constantly to the values and demands of those 
who pull the strings, and is not governed sufficiently by 
India's own needs and conditions for optimum benefit. But such 
harm is nothing compared with what can ensue if in an abject and 
unwarranted spirit of helplessness India gives in to pressures 
on Kashmir which may be wholly incompatible with the country's 
territorial and, what is more important, social integrity. After 
doing its best for obtaining America's understanding, India must 
learn to do without it if that becomes necessary.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinkar Shukla: "Clinton Creates Doubts Regarding </F>
His Intentions in Kashmir"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 3 February--Three former foreign 
secretaries of the Indian Government believe that the Clinton 
government's designs for Kashmir are not sincere. They believe 
that by repeatedly raising the question of human rights 
violations in Kashmir, the United States is planning a big game. 
Is it working toward establishing an independent Kashmir? In 
response to this question, former foreign secretaries C.S. Jha, 
Maharaja Krishan Rasgotra, and A.P. Venkateshwaran all agree on 
one thing: India should be alert to U.S. plans. These three 
foreign secretaries are the same people who, in a joint 
communique last week, accused the United States of interfering 
in India's internal affairs. 
  The three former foreign secretaries told JANSATTA in the 
context of their joint communique that President Clinton, his 
senior assistants, and administrative officials issued 
statements during the last year that create just one image. It 
is clear that the U.S. administration's concern about human 
rights violations is superficial. The real reason is different. 
If we look at it within the framework of the United States' 
long-range strategy and defense plans, then we can understand 
it. Mr. Venkateshwaran referred to the 25 January inaugural 
speech given by President Clinton to a joint session of the 
House, in which he emphasized the importance of maintaining his 
country's supremacy in international relations. According to Mr. 
Rasgotra, with the end of the Cold War, the United States is 
moving forward with the idea in mind that the whole world is 
under its control. 
  Mr. Jha thinks that because the Democrat government is 
facing 
defeat on every front of foreign policy, it is worried, and 
perhaps President Clinton wishes to show some accomplishment on 
the Kashmir front. But trying to gain something there at the 
cost of India's unity and oneness will be very dangerous. There 
will be serious results, including the disruption of peace in 
this area, confrontations between India and Pakistan, and damage 
to our secular and democratic structure of government. 
  The three former foreign secretaries also believe that there 
is another reason for the U.S. attitude toward India: India's 
refusal to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. The Clinton 
administration is very angry about this. Mr. Jha and Mr. 
Rasgotra said that India does not have to accept U.S. pressure. 
After China became a major nuclear power and Pakistan attained 
nuclear capability, it would be meaningless for India to sign 
the NPT. Such a step would be suicidal. 
  Mr. Rasgotra suggested that India should oppose U.S. 
pressure. This is important for our national interest. He said, 
"We may be weak and poor now; however, we do not have to accept 
pressure from anyone." He said that the NPT was written in 1968. 
India has maintained its nuclear option since then. It should 
stay firm on its policy. 
  The three former foreign secretaries said that India is not 
a 
minor country; rather, it is the largest democracy in the world 
and the second largest country in terms of population. Mr. 
Venkateshwaran believes the Indian Government is to blame for 
the current situation. It has quietly tolerated external 
interference in Kashmir and other areas, especially U.S. 
interference. He accused the Narasimha Rao government of not 
caring for the nation's pride because it lacked self-confidence.

<F P=106> [Article by Kuldip Nayar: "The Bilateral </F>
Approach"--quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Policy-makers in Islamabad are apparently unaware of 
the sea-change in the Indian scene on Kashmir. After many years, 
the people, the press and most political parties are in a mood 
to have a settlement with Pakistan. They are generally on the 
defensive whenever Kashmir crops up because they are not happy 
over all that is happening in the valley. 
  On the other hand, never before had the government 
considered 
Kashmir a disputed territory as it has done now even in a 
roundabout way. The Shimla Agreement, which is India's Bible on 
Indo-Pak relations, specifically mentions a final settlement on 
Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi has adhered to the formulation. 
Even after declaring from the ramparts of Red Fort on the 
Independence Day that Kashmir is an integral part of lndia, 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao wrote a letter to Pakistan Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto proposing talks, including Kashmir as a 
subject. 
  As promised in Islamabad during the abortive meeting between 
the foreign secretaries of the two countries, New Delhi has sent 
a package of six proposals to improve the relationship. They may 
not be ideal ones. But they concede some ground, which can be 
expanded. 
  In contrast, Pakistan's response has been hysterical. It has 
declared a country-wide hartal [strike] for February 5. Benazir 
Bhutto has already gone to the UN Human Rights Commission 
accusing India of having committed excesses in Kashmir. And her 
foreign minister has threatened a nuclear war if Kashmir is not 
settled. 
  All this is familiar. This time the rhetoric is more shrill 
than before. Otherwise, it is the same exercise which Islamabad 
has gone over many a time. 
  Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the late Pakistan prime minister, too 
had threatened a 1,000 year war. Yet the same Bhutto turned so 
peace-loving that he not only agreed to convert the cease-fire 
line into a line of control but also hailed it as `a line of 
peace'. He signed the Shimla Agreement to consecrate a bilateral 
approach. He said he was sick of going to the world chanceries 
for help. After the 1965 and 1971 wars, he realised that he 
would have to sit one day with India, across the same table, to 
settle all disputes, including Kashmir. 
  Islamabad, under the leadership of his daughter, Benazir 
Bhutto, has taken a different course. It has unilaterally 
repudiated the Shimla Agreement. It has said that future 
bilateral talks will be aimed at finalising 'the modalities for 
holding plebiscite in Kash mir'. But clause Vl [Roman 6] of the 
agreement had mentioned `the modalities' in connection with `the 
establishment of durable peace and normalisation of relations, 
including a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir'. Nowhere does 
plebiscite figure. 
  Assuming that Pakistan wants nothing but a plebiscite, it 
surely realises what it is in for. While proposing plebiscite, 
the UN had laid down certain conditions. One is that the entire 
State of Jammu and Kashmir will come under the control of India. 
This means that Pakistan will have to vacate not only `Azad 
Kashmir' but also areas like Gilgit and Baltistan, which are now 
its integral part. (China too will have to vacate the Kashmir 
territory, which General Mohammad Ayub Khan had given to it in 
1962). 
  Two, the armed forces of Pakistan will have to withdraw from 
`Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan, leaving behind only a 
contingent of Indian forces to enforce law and order. Three, 
normalcy in the State must return before a plebiscite is held. 
  It is difficult to imagine Islamabad complying with these 
conditions. The people in Pakistan will never agree to the 
handing over of `Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan even 
temporarily. And Pakistan should note that there is no 
time-limit for normalcy to return. 
  New Delhi too cannot go back to plebiscite because it will 
revive religious animosities. When a referendum in the North 
West Frontier Province (NWFP) was held in 1947 to determine 
whether it should go to India or Pakistan, the choice got 
reduced to whether the Muslims wanted to vote for the Gita or 
the Koran. India cannot afford to rip open old wounds. Its 
battered secularism following the demolition of Babri Masjid 
cannot withstand any more knocks. 
  Both countries face a difficult situation. I am reminded of 
what Jawaharlal Nehru told Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in London in 
November 1961: "Zulfi, I know that we must find a solution for 
Kashmir. But we have got caught in a situation which we cannot 
get out of without causing damage to the systems and structures 
of our respective societies." 
  Another development which has taken place in the last few 
years is that the Kashmiris want independence. When India and 
Pakistan agreed to a plebiscite in 1948, the choice was confined 
to joining either India or Pakistan. Islamabad has repeatedly 
said that it wants the Kashmiris to decide about their future. 
Will it agree to the third option? And, is an independent 
Kashmir a tenable proposition? After all, the Maharaja of Jammu 
and Kashmir wanted his state to be independent after the British 
left but failed in his endeavour. Pakistan never accepted the 
idea. 
  The only solution possible is a settlement which may 
displease all the three, India, Pakistan and Kashmir, but may go 
some way in assuaging their sensitivities. One proposal is to 
soften the line of control so that the bona fide nationals of 
the state living in Kashmir and `Azad Kashmir' become one 
people. They should enjoy autonomy except in defence and foreign 
affairs. Both subjects should continue to vest in India and 
Pakistan in their respective parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The nationals of India and Pakistan should be able to visit 
the state by getting a visa -- the Indian citizens from 
Islamabad to go to `Azad Kashmir' and the Pakistanis from New 
Delhi to visit Kashmir. This arrangement is not an ideal one but 
it may enable the people on both sides to meet more often at 
least in Kashmir. It is quite possible that one day the high 
walls that fear and distrust have raised on the border will 
crumble and the people of the subcontinent, without giving up 
their separate identities, will work together for the common 
good.

<F P=106> [Editorial in two installments: "Is Pakistan Provoking India </F>
in Order to Instigate a War?"] 
<H5>  [7 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] The relationship between India and Pakistan has been 
full of tension for some time. India's relations with the United 
States are also becoming tense. Not only Indian, but foreign 
newspapers have also written a lot about the tension among 
India, Pakistan, and the United States of America at 
international level. Analyses are being made at international 
levels on this situation. Let us first discuss the tension 
between India and Pakistan. 
  The day Benazir Bhutto became Pakistan's prime minister a 
second time, she started to spew poison against India over the 
Kashmir issue. Recently, in Davos, Switzerland, and after her 
return from Geneva after attending the Human Rights Conference, 
Benazir Bhutto spoke against India continuously to international 
and national correspondents with regard to Kashmir. Benazir, who 
is nervous about her "civil war" with her brother and her 
mother, has started to emphasize her statements against India in 
order to divert the attention of her country and of opposition 
parties from her family. Bhutto has also been encouraged by the 
United States to speak out against India. Benazir also knows 
that U. S. President Clinton is opposed to India. Why is that? I 
will go over that later; however, after Pakistan failed in 
spreading terrorism in Punjab, all Benazir had left with her to 
condemn India all over the world was her "one-point program" on 
Kashmir. 
  The way the Indian government started to pressure various 
terrorist groups in the Kashmir Valley; the way these terrorists 
had to submit after the Hazratbal incident; and the way 
Pakistan's efforts to encourage terrorism at the international 
level was exposed have all pushed Pakistan to start efforts to 
spread unrest in Kashmir across the actual line of control. On 
one side, across the actual line of control, rockets are fired 
toward the Indian side. On the other side, bombs are set off in 
Jammu and Kashmir, and sensitive areas like TV towers are 
burned. We do not know how many times terrorist groups attacked 
our security forces in that state during the last month. The 
time has come for the ice to melt, and thousands of trained 
terrorists are waiting to cross the border into India. 
  While the terrorist groups are misleading the youths in 
Kashmir, Pakistani troops are shooting rockets loaded with time 
bombs into Indian territory. Recently, Pakistani-trained 
terrorists led an early morning organized attack in Kutwara city 
and forced security forces to shoot back in retaliation. 
Twenty-one people were killed in this exchange of fire, 
including three members of the Jammu-Kashmir police. The Hizb-ul 
Mujaheddin and the Jamat-ul Mujaheddin both started to raise a 
hue and cry over this and began to propagate that atrocities 
were being committed against Kashmiri Muslims. Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto also agreed with them and began to beat a drum at 
the international level that the Indian government was 
committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people and violating 
their human rights. A few days ago, a bomb went off in a Kathua 
movie house, killing two people and wounding 23 others. Pakistan 
is not worried about the people who were killed or wounded by 
that bomb blast, nor are any of the terrorist groups in the 
region. However, when the security forces take any action in 
their defense or to protect the people, then it is propagated 
that the Indian government is committing atrocities against the 
Kashmiri people. The international conspiracies hatched in 
Jammu-Kashmir are only aimed at attaining one goal: protecting 
the seat of power in Pakistan and keeping the attention of the 
Pakistani people focused on Kashmir. This gives Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto time to issue anti-Indian statements in the 
United Nations and the UN Human Rights Commission. She tells 
them, "Look at how the Indian government is committing 
atrocities against Kashmiri Muslims!" 
  Can there be another goal for Pakistan? Does Pakistan want 
to 
start another war with India? Is the Pakistani army inciting 
India to start a war? According to Indian military intelligence 
sources, we cannot deny the possibility that the Pakistani army 
is inciting India into war by shooting rockets across the 
India-Pakistan control line. According to intelligence sources, 
the Pakistani army, by shooting rockets in that region, is 
diverting the Indian armed forces attention from fighting the 
terrorists and is trying to divert their attention toward the 
Pakistani army. The intelligence sources claim that with the new 
wave of terrorism in Jammu-Kashmir, the Indian armed forces and 
security forces are busy dealing with terrorist acts. This will 
facilitate the entry of thousands of trained terrorists into the 
Kashmir Valley. The Pakistani army will take advantage of this 
opportunity and will take control of part of Indian territory. 
That means the Indian army would have to start a war with 
Pakistan to get those areas back. This way, two battle fronts 
will open in Kashmir. In this situation, when the Indian army is 
not getting cooperation from the Kashmiri people, and Pakistan 
is getting sympathy at the international level--including the 
United States of America--the United States will be able to 
pressure India on this issue, and Pakistan will be showered with 
new modern weapons and dollars. Using this pretext, Pakistan 
will be able to continue its Islamic bomb program, and during 
this period, Benazir Bhutto will be able to strengthen her 
position as prime minister. If we analyze Jammu-Kashmir and 
Pakistan's present situation closely, then the facts related 
above support the hypothesis that an international-level 
conspiracy is being implemented against India. Are the Americans 
involved with Pakistan in this conspiracy? Is not this a 
conspiracy to stop India from emerging as an economic power in 
South Asia? The anti-India international powers have perhaps 
begun to feel that after India has successfully suppressed 
terrorism in Punjab, sooner or later, terrorism in Kashmir will 
also end, and Pakistan will be defeated there also. What kind of 
attitude does the only superpower in the world, the United 
States, have toward India in this whole situation? I will talk 
about this in the next installment of this article. 
<H5>  [8 Feb p 4] </H5>
  [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and the Indian Foreign 
Ministry are now clear on the fact that President Clinton's 
policy on India-Pakistan relations and Kashmir and Punjab is 
against India. It was noted in the past that whenever there a 
Democrat was president in the United States, U.S. government 
policy was neither opposed to India nor in support it. American 
policy on Kashmir was always neutral. The Republican presidents 
have always implemented anti-India and pro-Pakistan policies. 
During John F. Kennedy's and Jimmy Carter's administrations, the 
United States had neutral policies about India. During the eras 
of Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, the United States encouraged 
Pakistan to spread an anti-Indian tirade and keep the Kashmir 
issue alive. Perhaps this is the first time in the history of 
United States-India relations that a Democrat, President 
Clinton, has adopted an anti-India attitude on Kashmir, Punjab, 
and India-Pakistan relations fronts. Have the attitudes of 
Democratic Party leaders changed regarding India, or has India 
failed to present its case appropriately to the United States? 
Whatever the reason, the United States tried to control India's 
economy through the World Bank recently and has given up its 
neutral position on the human rights issue of Kashmir and 
Punjab. The way the United States is encouraging Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto to spew poison against India clearly indicates 
its changed attitude toward India. 
  In light of this changed situation, India also started to 
speak out against U.S. high-handedness. Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao opposed U.S. economic, political, Kashmir, and Punjab 
policies in his speech in Davos, Switzerland. This was perhaps 
the first time since the late Mrs. Gandhi that an Indian prime 
minister used such words against the United States. The 
situation at that time was very different. At that time, India 
had the full support of the Soviet Union. At this time, however, 
it is surviving at the mercy of the United States, which is 
controlling the politics of the entire world. Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao's speech and the hints sent by our Foreign 
Ministry to the United States have made it clear that India does 
not like U.S. interference in its internal affairs. 
  The way India has expressed its reaction to the United 
States' anti-India policies makes it clear that there is a lot 
of tension between Delhi and Washington. Both sides will have to 
work very hard over the next few days to ease this tension. 
President Clinton is fully responsible for the problem in 
U.S.-India relations. The way he issued pro-Pakistan statements 
about Kashmir and Punjab against India has disappointed the 
Indian government. 
  This is perhaps the first time that the United States has 
failed to appoint an ambassador to its embassy in New Delhi. 
This can give us an idea of how important India is to the 
president of the United States. It was heard before that former 
Senator Stephen Solarz, who is pro-India, could be appointed 
ambassador to India. If this happens, there would be efforts to 
improve relations between India and the United States. Neither 
the U.S. administration nor President Clinton, however, have 
made a final decision about this. The situation has deteriorated 
so much now that Indian Ambassador Siddhartha Shankar Ray in 
Washington and our Foreign Ministry have been forced to believe 
that Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's proposed trip to the United 
States should be canceled. Mr. Rao had planned to visit the 
United States in February. There are still plans for Mr. 
Narasimha Rao to meet with Bill Clinton; however, according to 
Foreign Ministry sources, if President Clinton is so convinced 
against India on the Punjab and Kashmir issues that he is making 
open statements at the international level, Mr. Narasimha Rao's 
trip to the United States and meeting with Clinton will not 
yield any positive results. 
  As for India, the terrorism in Punjab has almost ended. The 
situation there has improved, and Punjab is making economic 
progress. A year ago, India's Foreign Ministry complained that 
the way terrorism was ended in Punjab under Narasimha Rao's 
leadership, and the way the U. S. policies opened the Indian 
economic system to the international market will cause the young 
U.S. President Clinton to praise India and invite our prime 
minister to visit the United States. He is the prime minister of 
the world's largest democracy and was visiting other countries. 
But the U.S. president did not invite him. Instead of praising 
Mr. Rao, Mr. Clinton encouraged propaganda against India. 
  It is surprising to learn that Clinton, who is the president 
of the world's only superpower, still believes there is 
terrorism in Punjab and that rights are violated there. The 
whole world knows that the situation in Punjab has changed over 
the last two years and that peace has been established there. 
The controversial letter that Mr. Clinton wrote to Ghulam Nabi 
Fai, who is president of the Pro-Pakistan Kashmir Council in the 
United States, and the way anti-India propaganda was accelerated 
in U.S. policy, forced Mr. Siddhartha Shankar Ray to threaten 
that if the U.S. government's attitude remained anti-India, then 
the Indian prime minister would cancel his trip to the United 
States. Such talk from the Indian ambassador and our foreign 
ministry will not have much of an effect on a powerful nation 
like the United States; however, by telling this to the United 
States at the international level, we have at least demonstrated 
our pride in independent policies. This step is praiseworthy. 
  In my personal opinion, after the United States started its 
propaganda against India, it was the first time our Foreign 
Ministry responded strongly to it. Before this, all U.S. 
decisions were considered as new laws by the whole world. India 
is the only country in the world with the courage to tell the 
United States, the policeman of the world, that India is fully 
alert to human rights and democracy, and that it will not accept 
external interference in this area. What will be the result of 
India's bluntness? How will it affect Indo-U.S. relations in the 
future? Will Pakistan's position become stronger because of the 
India-Pakistan tension? It is natural for such questions to 
arise; however, at this point, the most important question is of 
India's pride and self-respect. If we have to pay a heavy price 
to protect our pride and self-respect, we should be fully 
prepared to do so.

<F P=106> [Commentary by journalist Kanchan Gupta] </F>
  [Text] At a time when Pakistan is trying to misuse every 
international forum to propagate half-truths and outright lies 
about Kashmir, it is heartwarming to hear friends raise their 
voice against this nefarious game plan. One such friend of 
India is the president of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclac Havel, 
who is at present visiting this country. In no uncertain terms 
Mr. Havel has opposed the attempt to internationalize the 
Kashmir issue, thereby endorsing India's stand. Mr. Havel has 
asserted that the best way out is through peaceful bilateral 
negotiations as envisaged in the Shimla Agreement. Mr. Havel's 
stress on bilateral talks and peaceful negotiations stems from 
his abiding faith in the philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi, which 
revolves around the concept of nonviolence. 
  This is obviously not the case of those who would like to 
violate India's territorial integrity. Needless to add, the 
greatest threat on this front is today faced from Pakistan, 
which has been waging a low intensity proxy war in Kashmir for 
the past four years. How else does one explain the fact that 
even as Mr. Havel was prescribing bilateralism as the best 
option, Pakistan's representatives were busy trying to move a 
blatantly anti-India resolution at the ongoing UN Human Rights 
Conference in Geneva. Is Islamabad really interested in the 
welfare of the Kashmiri people, or is it more more bothered 
about embarrassing New Delhi? It would appear that it is the 
second point that interests Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government more 
than anything else. That is to harass India. For if India had 
anything to hide about the reality in Kashmir, it would not have 
allowed foreigners access to the valley. Over the past year more 
than a 100 foreign journalists and legislators have visited 
Kashmir. As recently as last Monday, four ambassadors to the 
European Commission representing the Netherlands, Greece, 
Belgium, and Germany were flown to Kashmir for an on-the-spot 
assessment of the situation. 
  Let there be no mistake about the purpose of sending a 
so-called fact-finding mission to Kashmir, which Pakistan has 
been pressing for time and again both in the UN and now at 
various human rights conferences. What Pakistan wants is a team 
of its own choice, preferably constituted by individuals who are 
favorably inclined toward promoting Islamabad's designs on 
Kashmir. Such a mission would serve the dual purpose of 
furthering the Pakistani cause and whitewashing Islamabad's 
nefarious game plan. It would no doubt try and suppress the fact 
that the Inter-Services Intelligence--ISI--has a finger in the 
Kashmir pie; that, had it not been for arms and material 
assistance from across the border, terrorism would not have 
flourished in the valley. Neither would such a team take note 
of the ISI training out-of-work Afghan mojahedin and then 
sending them into Kashmir to lend a helping hand to the 
separatists. 
  Given this backdrop, it is becoming increasingly imperative 
for India to mobilize international opinion against Pakistani 
designs on Kashmir. Thankfully, given India's record as a 
leading members of the Nonaligned Movement and its democratic 
credentials, not to mention the role the country has played in 
promoting the cause of the developing world--something which 
Pakistan can never boast of--there are numerous people who are 
willing to lend their voice against Islamabad's perception. For 
instance, last week the U.S. assistant secretary of state, Miss 
Robin Raphel, who had audaciously suggested a couple of months 
ago that Kashmir's accession to India was not final and binding, 
was taken to task by two senators, Mr. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
-- a Democrat and a former ambassador to India--and Mr. Hank 
Brown--a Republican. They did not mince words in criticizing 
the U.S. Administration for its South Asia policy as reflected 
in comments and statements on the Kashmir issue. Mr. Moynihan 
will soon be visiting India and it is hoped that the impressions 
he will carry back will improve awareness of the reality as it 
exists in Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Tensions Created Over Kashmir"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Indo-Pak relations are in a free-fall slide over 
the Kashmir problem. Mutual accusations and allegations followed 
by counter-allegations have filled the two neighbors with enmity 
toward one another. Pakistan is even more over-heated. A 
nation-wide strike is being observed to show solidarity with 
Kashmiri militants. This fruitless effort is like cutting off 
one's nose to spite one's face. In reaction, the Youth Congress 
[Indian Congress (I)] has held demonstrations. Demonstrations 
have been held near the Kashmir and Punjab borders [with 
Pakistan]. In both countries, these demonstrations have the 
possibility of flaring into violence and security forces may 
have to use force to contain these demonstrations. Mutual 
suspicions are escalating and could become explosive. When there 
is a halt in understanding between India and Pakistan, the 
increasing tensions in the Subcontinent become very worrisome. 
  Everyone knows the basic cause of the Kashmir crisis. After 
the separatists became involved in terrorism, the situation 
became more complex. It is no secret that these terrorists have 
received training, weapons and shelter from Pakistan. Pakistan 
wants all of Kashmir as its own. But Bhutto's intentions do not 
match those of the militants. Their dream is of an independent 
Kashmir. Consequently, Benazir's wishes are unlikely to be 
fulfilled. In reality, Kashmir is an inseparable part of India 
and its own internal affair. Benazir cannot take Kashmir by 
force. This is why she is so busy making a fuss about it 
everywhere. She is busy raising the subject at international 
forums and is not particular about where. For example, she tried 
to raise the Kashmir issue at an economic summit in Davos. It 
was farcical. People did not come to Davos to hear her lecture 
about Kashmir. She tried to present the Kashmir problem as an 
issue of concern to the entire Muslim world. Many Muslim 
countries, however, regard Kashmir as an internal matter of 
India. 
  Perhaps a more important point, though, is that the Muslim 
world is divided. Unlike the middle ages in which jihads were 
conducted in the name of religion, national interests are now 
paramount. When Pakistan was created as an Islamic nations, half 
of India's Muslims remained behind. They accepted the secularist 
Indian Republic. The Islamic community in Pakistan has been 
unable to build national unity on the basis of Islam. Was not 
Bangladesh created on differences of language and culture? 
[passage omitted on separatist tendencies in Pakistan] 
  Now Pakistan is raising Kashmir in international forums. 
There are supporters in the U.S. administration. The Kashmir 
problem is complex. The common man's life is full of uncertainty 
due to terrorists clashing with security forces. There has been 
suffering on all sides. Internationalization, however, is not 
the solution. Making Kashmir an Islamic nation is not the 
solution. Benazir Bhutto, living in a glass house herself, 
should not throw stones.

<F P=106> [Article in two parts by A.G. Noorani: "Why the </F>
POK"--quotation marks as published] 
<H5>  [11 Feb p 8] </H5>
<H5>  [Part I] </H5>
  [Text] On January 29, the JKLF [Jammu Kashmir Liberation 
Front] leader, Mr. Amanullah Khan, tartly reminded the Prime 
Minister of Pakistan, Mrs Benazir Bhutto, that Pakistan's 
persistent rejection of "the third option" of independence for 
Kashmir is "tantamount to denying them the very right of 
self-determination," a right which, he asserted, cannot be 
"limited, conditioned or circumscribed." But Pakistan's espousal 
of the right to self-determination has ever been self-servingly 
conditional and circumscribed. It is demanded of the part of 
Kashmir which, mercifully, escaped its occupation, albeit, not 
its repeated depredations. The right to self-determination is 
not recognized for Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, miscalled "Azad" 
(free) Kashmir. Pakistan has banned the cry of plebiscite or 
independence in the POK [Pakistan Occupied Kashmir]. 
  The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act, 1974, 
obliges all office-bearers from the President down and all 
legislators to swear loyalty "to the cause of accession of the 
State of Jammu and Kashmir to Pakistan." Islam is made the State 
religion (Article 3). The President and the Prime Minister must 
be Muslim. 
<H5>  Plebiscite Plea </H5>
  The fundamental right to freedom of association is 
restricted 
to forbid the cry of a free plebiscite. The POK bans political 
parties which advocate independence, let alone accession to 
India. Article 7(2) reads thus: "No person or political party in 
Azad Jammu and Kashmir shall be permitted to propagate against, 
or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to, the 
ideology of the State's accession to Pakistan." In short, none 
can ask for a plebiscite as such in the POK. They can ask only 
for accession to Pakistan. Plebiscite is for the rest of the 
State. 
  This Constitution was imposed on the POK by the former Prime 
Minister, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, after he had, in a speech at the POK 
capital Muzaffarabad on November 7, 1973, asked the people "not 
to aspire for an independent status" and offered them three 
choices--the status quo, a full-fledged province of Pakistan, or 
"provincial status"--as if the territory was Pakistan's to deal 
with as it pleased rather than one temporarily in "its 
occupation pending a solution to the Kashmir dispute. In 
Pakistan's perception, it is the rest of the State which is 
"disputed territory," not the part it has grabbed. 
  The POK's Constitution of 1974 was imposed on it. Its 
preamble recites that the Government of Pakistan "approved" the 
repeal of the 1970 Constitution "and authorized the 
President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to introduce" the 
Constitution Bill "for consideration and passage." The document 
rivets the POK to Pakistan's constitutional and political system. 
  The POK's legal status and Pakistan's conduct in respect of 
it over the years are surely of crucial relevance in the quest 
for solutions to the Kashmir question. But the POK has ever been 
a dark and neglected area. Pakistan has adroitly focused 
attention on the rest of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, which 
it ardently covets. That fact should not deflect one from the 
duty to subject the Government of India's actions to scrutiny 
and criticism, especially the violation of human rights and 
political freedom. But Pakistan's conduct in the POK should 
receive the same treatment. It has not, however. 
  Pakistan resents such criticism. It resents intensely the 
expression Pak-Occupied Kashmir and uses blithely its coinage 
"Indian-Held Kashmir." If one were to take "the U.N. 
resolutions" by which it swears as common ground, one would find 
that while the legality of the accession of the State of Jammu 
and Kashmir was consistently and explicitly accepted in those 
resolutions, the expression "Pak-Occupied Kashmir" is derived 
from those very documents. 
  They have a lineage in the proceedings of the Security 
Council at an early stage. The United States Representative, Mr. 
Warren Austin, said on February 4, 1948: "We must face the legal 
situation. The external sovereignty of Jammu and Kashmir is no 
longer under the control of the Maharaja ... with the accession 
of Jammu and Kashmir to India, this foreign sovereignty went 
over to India and is exercised by India and that is how India 
happens to be here as a petitioner." 
  On January 20, 1948, the Security Council set up a 
three-member Commission. On April 21, 1948, the Council not only 
expanded its membership to five but laid down the details of a 
plebiscitory solution. A Plebiscite Administrator was to be 
nominated by the U.N. Secretary-General. Para 10(b) said: "The 
Plebiscite Administrator, acting as an officer of the State of 
Jammu and Kashmir, should have authority to nominate his 
assistants--and to draft regulations governing the plebiscite. 
Such nominees should be formally appointed and such draft 
regulations should be formally promulgated by the State of Jammu 
and Kashmir." 
<H5>  Recognition </H5>
  This is an explicit recognition by the UN of: (a) the 
legality of Kashmir's accession to India; (b) India's external 
sovereignty over the State; and (c) the legal authority of the 
Government of the State. Hence, the formal induction of the 
Plebiscite Administrator by the State Government, although he 
was to be nominated by the UN Secretary-General. 
  The UN Commission for India and Pakistan, acting under this 
mandate, arrived in the subcontinent in July, 1948. At the 
outset, on August 5, 1948, its members agreed that it should 
avoid any action which might be interpreted as signifying de 
facto or de jure recognition of the "Azad Kashmir Government." 
On August 13, 1948, the UNCIP [UN Commission for India and 
Pakistan] adopted a resolution embodying its proposals for a 
settlement. India accepted it. Pakistan did not. 
  On December 11, 1948, the UNCIP offered proposals in 
amplification of the first to provide for a plebiscite. Both 
sides accepted it. They were formally embodied in its resolution 
of January 5, 1949, the parties having declared a ceasefire on 
New Year's Day. As Ms. Krishna Menon said in the Security 
Council on February 8, 1957, "the only international engagements 
that exist are two resolutions of the UNCIP dated August 13, 
1948, and January 5, 1949. These are the engagements. If they 
were of a formal character, they might be treaties..." 
<H5>  Legal Status </H5>
  The UNCIP had published in November, 1948, in its first 
interim report, the minutes of its talks with both sides. They 
were thus fully aware of the UNCIP's clarifications before they 
accepted its second resolution. It is the August 13, 1948, 
resolution which defined the legal status of the authorities in 
the POK. It provided first for a ceasefire; next, a truce 
agreement laying down details of troop withdrawals on both 
sides; and finally determination of the future status of Kashmir 
"in accordance with the will of the people." The word plebiscite 
was not used. That was done in the second resolution. 
  While the tribesmen from Pakistan and Pakistan's troops were 
to be withdrawn completely, India was to withdraw only "the bulk 
of its forces," retaining some "to assist local authorities in 
the observance of law and order." That was not the only 
asymmetry. The existence of the Government of the State of Jammu 
and Kashmir was explicitly recognized and so, indeed, was the 
State's accession to India and assumption of "external 
sovereignty." Accordingly, the resolution provided that "the 
Government of India will undertake to ensure that the Government 
of the State of Jammu and Kashmir" will safeguard law and order 
"and that human and political rights will be respected." 
  For the other part of the State, the resolution said: 
"Pending a final solution, the territory evacuated by the 
Pakistani troops will be administered by the local authorities 
under the surveillance of the Commission." This, the only 
provision for that area, is in contrast to the clear recognition 
of the State Government, acting under the Government of India in 
respect of external relations. No surveillance was provided for 
this part of the State. 
<H5>  [12 Feb p 8] </H5>
<H5>  [Part II] </H5>
  [Text] The Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Sir Muhammad 
Zafrullah Khan, had an important meeting with the UNCIP on 
September 2, 1948. Its minutes have not been published. But 
Sardar Mohammed Ibrahim Khan, the founder-President of the "Azad 
Kashmir" Government, published in his informative book "The 
Kashmir Saga" some revealing extracts. They show that Sir 
Zafrullah was clearly told: "By `local authorities' we mean the 
Azad Kashmir people though we cannot grant recognition to the 
Azad Kashmir Government." 
  These authorities "will be responsible for the maintenance 
of 
law and order and security"--only. More explicitly, "we cannot 
lose sight of the fact that the State of Jammu and Kashmir still 
exists as a legal entity. We have to respect its 
sovereignty." Sir Zafrullah himself had told the Commission 
earlier that "even his own Government had not granted legal 
recognition for the Azad `Government' in view of the 
implications which might ensue." 
<H5>  Puppet </H5>
  Not long after, Pakistan recognized this puppet 
"Government." 
A new regime was imposed on the POK on June 21, 1952. Rules of 
Business were prescribed on October 28, Rule 5 said: "The 
President of Azad Kashmir Government shall hold office during 
the pleasure of the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference duly 
recognized as such by the Government of Pakistan in the Ministry 
of Kashmir Affairs." The Ministry's Joint Secretary could attend 
meetings of the Council of Ministers and "tender advice on any 
matter under discussion." What, one must ask, are the legal 
"implications" of such a set-up in the POK, which has existed 
for over four decades in flagrant breach of the UNCIP's 
resolution? 
  On August 17, 1948, Prime Minister Nehru asked the UNCIP 
about the import of the reference to "the local authorities" in 
the POK. He was told, the minutes record, that "the phrase 
pending a final solution was intended to recognize 
the temporary nature of the administration by local authorities. 
Sovereignty over the territory was not to be 
changed." This clearly meant sovereignty of the State 
Government over the POK. For, it was in answer to Nehru's 
pointed query whether the UNCIP "envisaged any change in the 
status of the territory or whether it recognized the 
jurisdiction of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir over that 
territory." Equally explicit assurances were given in subsequent 
talks. 
  This brings us to the nomenclature which raises the hackles 
of our Pakistani friends--the POK. The UNCIP resolution of 
August 13, 1948, spoke of "the territory evacuated by the 
Pakistani troops." Since the evacuation has not yet taken place, 
is it unfair to call it Pak-Occupied Kashmir? Especially since 
the UNCIP clarified to Sir Zafrullah on September 3, 1948, that 
"the term evacuated territory refers to those 
territories in the State of Jammu and Kashmir which are at 
present under the effective control of the Pakistan High 
Command." 
  This is the nub of the matter. The legal sovereignty of the 
State of Jammu and Kashmir over "those territories" was 
recognized. So, also, the de facto position that they were 
"under the effective control" of the Pakistani Army. There is 
not much to choose between PCK (Pak-Controlled Kashmir) and POK 
(Pak-Occupied Kashmir). 
  There is, however, a graver aspect, besides. Nehru wrote to 
the UNCIP on August 20, 1948, that its resolution of August 13, 
"should not be interpreted, or applied in practice, so as: (a) 
to bring into question the sovereignty of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Government over the portion of their territory evacuated by 
Pakistani troops; (b) to afford any recognition of the so-called 
`Azad Kashmir Government'; or (c) to enable this territory to be 
consolidated in any way during the period of truce to the 
disadvantage of the State." On August 25, the UNCIP assured 
Nehru that his interpretation "coincides with its own 
interpretation." 
  These assurances were known to Pakistan when it accepted 
"the 
plebiscite resolution" of January 5, 1949. It provided that the 
Plebiscite Administrator "will be formally appointed to office 
by the Government of Jammu and Kashmir." He "shall derive from 
the State of Jammu and Kashmir" the requisite powers and shall 
report the result of the plebiscite not only to the UNCIP but 
also "to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir." 
  In this, the UNCIP acted with perfect legal propriety. The 
legality of the State's accession to India was incontestable. 
That did not preclude a plebiscite, however. But among the prime 
causes which have rendered a plebiscite impossible is, surely, 
Pakistan's annexation of the POK and its policies towards the 
rest of the State. The war of 1965, for instance. It sought to 
grab it at its chosen forum, the battlefield, and failed. 
<H5>  Aggression </H5>
  It seeks the same result today by a low-cost, covert 
operation. The POK has served as a launching pad for this 
aggression. It is firmly riveted to Pakistan's control through 
the Azad J &amp; K Council, set up by S. 21 of the Act of 1974. 
It 
is presided over by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and comprises 
his five nominees, the President and Prime Minister of the POK 
and six representatives of the POK Assembly, elected by 
proportional representation. 
  Political developments faithfully mirror those in 
Pakistan--Basic Democracy of Ayub Khan, Zia's Martial Law, and 
the rest. In December, 1993, the blasphemy laws of Pakistan were 
extended to the POK. The northern areas of the State have been 
dismembered from the POK and their status as part of the State 
questioned, inviting a stinging rebuff from the POK's High Court 
on March 8, 1993. They are ruled directly through a Chief 
Executive, Lt-Gen. Mohammad Shafiq, appointed by Islamabad, with 
a 26-member Northern Areas Council. The people have never seen 
elections or enjoyed political or human rights. 
  The POK is better only in form. In 1990 the Pakistan 
People's 
Party came to power. In 1991, after Mrs Bhutto's dismissal, 
elections were held again which all outside the ruling party in 
Islamabad called "foul." The POK's Premier, Mr. M.H. Rathore, 
rejected the results and announced a fresh poll. On July 5, 
1991, he was sacked by Islamabad, arrested after a Federal 
Minister and a Brigadier in the Army had inveigled him out of 
his residence on the pretext that the Army Chief wished to meet 
him. He was flown to Islamabad, put in a guest house, and beaten 
up. 
<H5>  Self-Interest </H5>
  Let us go back to the basics. Why did Pakistan's troops 
enter 
Kashmir at all "early in May, 1948?" Purely in self-interest. 
The information was given belatedly to the UNCIP on July 8, 
1948--not to the Security Council at all. A memo by Pakistan to 
the UNCIP on August 19, 1948, set out the reasons candidly. It 
was a perceived "threat to Pakistan's security" posed by Indian 
military operations against the tribesmen. "It was this which 
compelled the Government of Pakistan to move their troops into 
certain defensive positions." There they remain stay put to this 
day, occupying areas of the State in breach of the UNCIP's 
resolutions and of Pakistan's own assurances to it. In contrast 
to the Government in Srinagar, the regime in Muzaffarabad is one 
set up by Pakistan in territory it has occupied, not acquired by 
law. 
  None of this minimizes the need to resolve the vexed problem 
of Kashmir "in accordance with the will of the people," as the 
1948 resolution put it. But the contours of a solution in 1994 
will necessarily be different from those that were envisaged in 
1948-49 given Pakistan's concept of selective 
self-determination. Neither plebiscite nor independence can now 
be contemplated. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise a 
solution which satisfies the aspirations of the people within 
the Indian Union, redresses the grave wrongs they have suffered, 
and also provides for the legitimate interests of Pakistan and 
of the POK.

  [Excerpt] New Delhi, Feb 11--India today firmly rejected a 
recent reference by the United States to the situation in 
Kashmir, comparing it to the situation in Afghanistan and 
asserted that such references betrayed the "lack of balance and 
proper perspective" on the part of U.S. officials which was 
tantamount to providing "encouragement to Pakistan and 
terrorists sustained by them to continue with their violent 
activities." 
  Noting that the remarks recently made in Washington by the 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Ms. 
Robin Raphel, a spokesman of the Ministry of External Affairs 
today said the comparison was grossly misplaced as the Afghan 
situation was a by-product of the Cold War whereas Jammu and 
Kashmir has been facing a massive campaign of terrorism aided 
and abetted by Pakistan. The only link between the two was that 
the weapons and mercenaries were moved from both Afghanistan and 
Pakistan to foment trouble in Kashmir, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Jammu, Feb 11--Top Kashmiri secessionist leader 
Shabir Ahmed Shah has warned that India and Pakistan could meet 
the same fate which befell the Soviet Union if they do not seek 
a negotiated settlement to the 46-year-old Kashmir imbroglio in 
harmony with the people of Kashmir. 
  "Soviet Union was a superpower and India and Pakistan are 
just developing countries--no match for erstwhile Soviet Union 
even as India mistakenly claims to be a superpower," he told 
newspersons after he came out of a special court in Jammu trying 
cases under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) 
Act (Tada). 
  The Kashmiri leader, recognised as a prisoner of conscience 
who had spent a total of 21 years in jail, recalled telling 
India: "We have not (sic) enemity with Indians but we are 
opposed (sic) usurption of Kashmir by Indian Government." 
  Shah, who heads the powerful Peoples League Party of 
Kashmir, 
said the present armed movement would continue until India 
"honestly" came forward for talks with the Kashmiris and 
Pakistan to solve the dispute in accordance with the wishes of 
the Kashmiris. "We are even prepared for talks and invite all 
parties to the dispute namely Kashmirs, India and Pakistan 
besides international observers and some friendly countries (to) 
settle the problem." 
  Earlier, at the first hearing of the Tada case field against 
him by the State Government, Shah, in a statement presented to 
the court, denied the charge made when he was arrested in 1989 
that he was going to Pakistan, and that Pakistani currency notes 
had been recovered from him. 
  He said he wanted the implementation of a UN resolution on 
Kashmir, which he said Hari Singh, the former Kashmir Maharaja, 
and Nehru, too, had accepted. 
  Asked whether he stood by two options of India and Pakistan 
declared in the UN resolution, he said ultimately the people of 
Kashmir had to decide, and if they wanted "independence nobody 
can prevent them." 
  Shah spoke of the destruction caused in Kashmir in the past 
four years and said: "Hundreds of people were killed and 
hundreds of women were molested as hundreds of human settlements 
were destroyed." "Thousands of people had been arrested and many 
of them (were) subjected to torture at interrogation centres." 
  Shah said the accession to India was "illegitimate and 
unlawful," arguing: "If saying so is a crime (I am) prepared 
(to) confess my guilt." 
  Outside the court, Shah's 75-year-old mother told 
newspersons 
that she was proud of her son. "He is a great 
mujhahid (freedom fighter) and even if he is hanged 
(I) will have no regrets because he has been fighting for the 
cause for last 21 years." 
  Meanwhile, an official spokesman said four militants, 
including a self-styled company commander of the pro-Pakistan 
Hizbul-Mujahidin, were killed in two separate encounters with 
security forces during search operations in Baramulla district 
last evening. A militant was apprehended and four AK 47 rifles, 
five magazines and 30 rounds were recovered during the searches. 
  The spokesman said security forces averted a major disaster 
when they detected and defused three powerful improvised 
explosive devices (IED) and an anti-personnel mine at Anantnag 
last night. Some unidentified gunmen shot at and seriously 
wounded a person at Alichabag in the district. 
  The spokesman said security forces apprehended six militants 
during search operations and recovered a large quantity of arms 
and ammunition in the Valley during the past 24 hours. 
  Pakistan-trained militants fired four rockets fitted with 
mines in the Manjakote area of Rajouri district last evening. 
Two rockets exploded at a deserted place without causing any 
damage, while two others did not explode and were recovered by 
security forces during searches, official sources said. 
  The said earlier militants and Pakistani troops had fired 
several rockets fitted with time bombs in Poonch and Rajouri 
districts during last month. This is the first time the rockets 
were fitted with mines.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Winner in the Round-Robin"] </F>
  [Text] Once again Ms. Robin Raphel has attacked the 
government of India. Though a state department underling she, it 
is said, has a lot of clout in the United States administration 
because she is supposed to be close to the U.S. president, Mr. 
Bill Clinton. 
  Last October, Ms. Raphel had attacked the Indian position on 
Kashmir by saying the U.S. administration did not take as final 
the state's accession to the Indian Union. That time Ms. 
Raphel's revelation had come as part of a background briefing to 
the media. In four months, she has come back to the very same 
theme of Kashmir, saying that it is as bad as Afghanistan. But 
this time it was a public speech at the Asia Society's 
Washington branch. Ms. Raphel went further to warn that Kashmir, 
like Afghanistan, has "the potential to mutate into wider 
regional conflicts." 
  This bombshell from the head of the South Asia bureau of the 
state department was unexpected for U.S watchers in India. In 
fact, most of them had tried to dismiss Ms. Raphel's earlier 
statement questioning Kashmir's accession to India as the 
outburst of an individual in the U.S. government and not the 
latter's considered view. Explanations were even sought and 
received from official quarters in Washington. It was given out 
that Ms. Raphel did not represent the official U.S. viewpoint. 
  This time no such alibi can be forthcoming since the lady 
herself has been quoted as saying whatever she had said was 
backed by the "full authority" of Mr. Clinton. She added that 
all her remarks reflected the U.S. administration's policy and 
were not personal observations. 
  A careful analysis of the present state of the U.S. 
government's attitude to India makes it abundantly clear what 
Ms. Raphel said both now and earlier could not possibly be 
dismissed as the impudent remarks of a U.S. official airing her 
personal opinion and thereby breaking protocol. In a sense, Ms. 
Raphel has done India a good turn by leaving very little scope 
for any illusions about the U.S. administration's attitude to 
India. 
  Some in India feel the U.S. approach towards India has 
radically changed for the better. They argue old prejudices 
about India as a camp follower of Moscow no longer exist since 
the Soviet Union itself has disappeared and the world has 
emerged out of the superpower rivalry of the Cold War years. 
This argument is buttressed by the theory that since India has 
scrapped the Nehruvian model of development, is willing to toe 
the World Bank's free market line on the economic front and has 
invited multi-nationals to invest in the country, the United 
States has come to regard it not only as a good friend but as a 
virtual camp follower. 
  Not only on the economic front but in defence as well, 
Washington must have -- or should have -- noticed New Delhi's 
readiness to comply with its injunctions. This was evident by 
the fact Indian military authorities extended their cooperation 
to the U.S. Pacific command, and then, more pointedly, agreed to 
send forces to Somalia as desired by Washington. 
  The expected results turned out rather discomforting for 
this 
pro-U.S. lobby in India. Mr. Clinton's speech on Kashmir before 
the United Nations general assembly last year made it abundantly 
clear he saw the situation in the state as a civil war. Over the 
last two months, he has demonstrated which way he leans by 
responding with a touch of affectionate sympathy to a letter 
from one of the militant organisations in Kashmir demanding 
secession from India. As if this were not enough, he has 
sympathised with a Khalistani outfit as well. 
  Mr. John Mallot to Ms. Robin Raphel with Mr. Clinton's 
rather 
unorthodox interjections in between -- it is clear Washington is 
hardly reconciled to New Delhi's stand that Kashmir is part of 
India. While a number of Western governments have in recent 
times expressed their misgivings at the violation of human 
rights in Kashmir, none has questioned the validity of Kashmir 
being part of India. 
  When Mr. Clinton in his address before the UN general 
assembly referred to Kashmir as having a civil war situation, he 
implied the legitimacy of the Indian government's authority over 
Kashmir was in question. If it was only a case of human rights 
violations on the part of the Indian security forces, then one 
does not have to use the term civil war. The concept of civil 
war itself implies that rival forces are contending for state 
power. In other words, the two sides, namely the Indian security 
forces and the armed militants, are to be looked at as being on 
par in their respective claims to state power. 
  In this context, Ms. Raphel's October observation sought to 
provide a historical justification for the U.S. official 
position, that is, Kashmir's accession to the Indian Union 
itself could not be regarded as final and irrevocable. Her 
latest remark that Kashmir is in the same category as 
Afghanistan is all the more ominous. 
  What is the situation in Afghanistan today? It is admitted 
by 
all that there is no state authority in that country, torn as it 
is between rival factions fighting one another to extend their 
respective domains by sheer use of force. There is no central 
authority in Afghanistan. It cannot even be said that he who 
controls Kabul rules the country. The three contending leaders 
-- Mr. Abdul Rashid Dostum, Mr. Ahmad Shah Mas'ud and Mr. 
Golboddin Hekmatyar -- are all equally matched and none can 
claim to be superior to the other. 
  When someone in all seriousness compares Kashmir with the 
Afghan situation, it is clearly a case of inciting the Kashmiri 
militants against the authority of the government of India. It 
is an announcement the Indian government is as effete as 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani, and no superior than Messrs 
Hekmatyar, Dostum and Mas'ud. 
  Washington's position has thus moved very far from 
expressions of concern at the violation of human rights. It is 
often pleaded by the U.S. administration and its cohorts that 
what really bothers Washington about the present unrest in 
Kashmir is that it might spark off a full scale war between 
India and Pakistan. In this war, it fears, both countries might 
at some stage be desperate enough to use nuclear weapons. 
  Nuclear weapons, the U.S. authorities are convinced, both 
India and Pakistan possess or are capable of producing at short 
notice. So the real U.S. concern, it is argued, is the danger of 
a nuclear war breaking out in south Asia, particularly when both 
countries have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
  But the Indian perception is that the nuclear war danger is 
being used as a excuse for U.S. intervention in the world after 
the Cold War. The United States tries to justify its persistent 
inroads into Iraq's sovereignty by saying Mr. Saddam Husayn 
might build the nuclear bomb. This is taken as an example of the 
U.S. cooking up an alibi for direct intervention -- next time in 
the affairs of south Asia with the Kashmir crisis being played 
up beyond recognition. 
  It is time New Delhi woke up to these new realities. To 
expect that the Clinton administration will pull up Pakistan and 
thereby ensure arms supply to Kashmiri militants is stopped is 
to misread the U.S. objective in Kashmir. The U.S. has in fact 
no interest in curbing militant secessionism in the valley. It 
needs to be stressed that both Ms. Raphel's and Mr. Clinton's 
pronouncements must have acted as a tonic to the Kashmiri 
militants. 
  New Delhi's campaign last year beseeching the U.S. 
administration to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was 
unrealistic. For those in the Indian government who tried to do 
so, the U.S. official pronouncements must have come as a shock 
from which they will take a long time to recover. One can guess 
from their pathetic position how unreal it would be to expect 
the prime minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, to pay an official 
visit to Washington, which is what some of his officials have 
been trying hard to arrange this summer.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of interview with K.P. Singh Gill, director </F>
general of Punjab police, by R. Balaji; place and date not 
given--quotation marks as published--first three paragraphs 
DECCAN CHRONICLE introduction] 
  [Text] Hyderabad, Jan 13--He does not betray the image of 
being the `super cop' of the country. Obviously delighted with 
the resounding success he and his men had against the terrorists 
in Punjab, Mr. K.P. Singh Gill, the Director-General of the 
Punjab police, feels that, if Punjab can be freed from the 
stranglehold of terrorists, there is no reason why the volatile 
Jammu and Kashmir cannot [be] freed from the trigger-happy 
ultras. 
  And given Mr. Gill's determination and the way in which he 
paid the Punjab terrorists in their own coin, Kashmir can 
certainly become once again a peaceful and prosperous State that 
it was a decade back. Will he go to Kashmir to counter the 
terrorists? "Yes, if the government wants me," says Mr. Gill 
like a true soldier. 
  Mr. Gill, who is now on a visit to the city, spoke to DECCAN 
CHRONICLE at length on the way he dealt with the militants in 
his State. 
  Excerpts from the interview. 
  What priorities did you have in mind when you worked 
out a strategy for Punjab? 
  The top priority was to beat the terrorists at their own 
game. Develop the expertise to meet them face to face, match 
their firepower, strategy and ultimately it was a man to man 
fight. When we changed our strategy and also improved our 
weaponry and intelligence network, we were always ahead of them 
and able to put them down. 
  Did your strategy go as per the plan? 
  We kept two things in mind. First we knew we had to react to 
their moves and counter it. Then we wanted to try and find out 
about their recruits and prevent the same. We also countered 
their propaganda and tried to cut their roots, destroy their 
bases and indulge in day and night combing operations. 
  Was there any change in the strategy adopted by your 
predecessor, Mr. J.F.Riberio, and you? 
  My strategy was part of an extension of the strategy adopted 
by Mr. Riberio. We extended upon the 25 percent success achieved 
by him. 
  What is the estimated member of terrorists remaining in 
the State? 
  There are no active terrorists now. Once in a while they 
come 
from other places and indulge in some acts and escape. But now 
we are very alert and preventing them from coming in. 
  Do you think the police alone was responsible for the 
success or is it because of better coordination with other 
agencies? 
  Oh yes! We had very good cooperation from the Army, BSF 
[Border Security Force], CRPF [Central Reserve Police Force] and 
others which contributed to the success. 
  What is the role of Pakistan in promoting subversive 
activities in Punjab? 
  Pakistan is very much involved in encouraging terrorist 
activities in the State. The recent arrest of Dr Sohan Singh 
revealed that at least eight important leaders of different 
groups are operating from Pakistan. 
  Is there a difference of opinion between you and the 
Chief Minister, Mr. Beant Singh? 
  No there is no differences between me and the Chief 
Minister. 
  Since the focus on terrorist violence has shifted from 
Punjab to Kashmir and in view of your own success in Punjab, 
would you prefer to take an assignment in Kashmir? 
  Yes ... for some time there was such a talk. If the 
government wants my services for Kashmir, I am ready for it. And 
I will go there if they want me. 
  Are you confident of achieving success in Kashmir 
too? 
  Well, one does not go to a place to fail in the mission. One 
goes to the place wanting to achieve success. 
  What strategy do you envisage for tackling the 
militants in Kashmir? 
  Sitting at a distant place (Punjab) one cannot work out any 
strategy. You have to be there to take a decision. 
  After your term, would you be interested in joining 
politics? 
  I have no intention of joining politics.

  [Text] Dr. Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu 
and Kashmir and the National Conference leader, has become too 
active in the valley affairs after his return from London. He is 
making some meaningless statements to support his selfish 
political interests which might aggravate the situation. Farooq 
recently said in an interview given in Geneva, where he had gone 
as the Indian representative to the 50th conference of the UN 
Human Rights Commission, that the central government should soon 
prepare a formula to resolve the Kashmir issue. This formula 
should include plans to return to the pre-1953 position given to 
Kashmir under to the Indian Constitution. He had indirectly 
supported giving autonomy to Jammu-Kashmir by this statement. 
Farooq wants the valley to get its former constitutional 
position so that he could become its leader and call himself the 
prime minister instead of the chief minister, establish a 
separate election commission, and negotiate a new definition of 
the valley with the Center. We can praise Dr. Abdullah's 
interview given in Geneva for strongly criticizing Pakistan for 
interfering in India's internal affairs, however, we cannot 
agree with his suggestion to announce a special package giving 
Kashmir its former constitutional position. 
  Autonomy or a special package for Jammu-Kashmir cannot 
guarantee solving the problems in the very sensitive and 
riot-torn state. This could raise questions about unity in this 
region because the problems there have been created by Pakistan 
deliberately. New conspiracies are implemented every day to 
spread anarchy, and it is not possible for Farooq Abdullah to be 
unaware of it all. He has isolated himself by issuing this 
statement in Geneva. He is neither the authorized spokesman for 
Jammu-Kashmir nor can he be considered the only representative 
of the Jammu-Kashmir people. Who will make the decision to 
prepare a special plan for the valley under this situation? It 
is useless to think about a special package when there is no 
elected government in the state. It is a good thing that the 
central government did not take Farooq Abdullah's statement 
seriously and Home Minister Chavan has refused to issue any kind 
of special package before the election in Kashmir. Farooq said 
that he was not afraid of the threats issued by the terrorists 
in the valley and that his suggestion, if the government decides 
to accept it, could help people there to learn about their 
rights and to establish peace in the valley. His ideas show his 
superficial mentality and reeks of political vested interests. 
  The most important step to establish peace in Kashmir and 
start the political process there is to put an end of the 
Pakistan-supported terrorist activities. The naive youth in the 
valley must be made aware of Pakistan's unholy designs and be 
made to understand that their interests would be protected only 
if they remain with their own country and help maintain peace. 
Pakistan and its intelligence agency, ISI, are pulling all kind 
of stunts to make sure peace is not established in the valley. 
Its rulers are trying to condemn India by raising the Kashmir 
issue at the international level, and its intelligence agency 
ISI is sending trained terrorists to create unrest in Kashmir. 
India, after a long time, has accelerated diplomatic efforts and 
started a strong campaign to silence Pakistan. Similar alertness 
and swiftness is needed at the border so that Pakistan is forced 
to give up its declared policy of spreading unrest in Kashmir. 
Only then can the situation in the valley be normal and the 
atmosphere be made conducive to starting a political process. 
The Farooq formula can create new problems in the present 
situation and also will provide encouragement to Pakistan. 
Therefore, it should not be discussed at all.

  [Text] New Delhi, 14 February (Press Trust)--Minister of 
External Affairs Dinesh Singh informed today that Amnesty 
International will be permitted to visit Kashmir on a 
point-by-point basis. 
  The foreign minister was addressing the parliamentary 
advisory committee. He said that he was forming a transparent 
policy on Kashmir. He said that the government had given 
permission to some members of the International Committee of the 
Red Cross and a group of ambassadors from four European nations 
to visit Kashmir. These members visited several parts of Kashmir 
valley last week and reviewed the situation there. 
  Mr. Dinesh Singh said that this step will help counter the 
accusations of human rights violations in Kashmir being made at 
Pakistan's behest at the international level. He said that there 
is the danger that separatist and terrorist organizations might 
stage some drama for the benefit of foreign guests and 
communication media, however, the government will continue this 
transparent policy. 
  Several members in the meeting suggested that an Indian 
deputation should try to aggressively stop Pakistan's propaganda 
in the UN Human Rights Commission meeting. 
  Messrs Jagjit Singh, Umrao Singh, L.B. Rawal, B.B. Dutt, 
T.N. 
Chaturvedi, Ram Jethmalani, Chit Basu, Sharad Didhe, and G.G. 
Sawel were some of the prominent members present in the meeting. 
  India has meanwhile advised the United States as a friend of 
Pakistan to prepare Islamabad for bilateral talks with Delhi 
over various issues including Kashmir. 
  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao told Senator Patrick Monyhan 
(D) 
here today that it is imperative that Pakistan is made to 
understand that it is useless to raise the Kashmir issue at 
various levels. These actions are increasing tension and wasting 
time. 
  Mr. Rao said that India was following all the diplomatic 
protocols while Pakistan was doing exactly the opposite. 
  Mr. Monyhan during his visit with Home Minister Shankar Rao 
Chavan said that the Shimla agreement is a major support for 
improving Indo-Pakistan relations. He said that there has been 
no change in the U.S. policy on Kashmir. 
  A senior official in the Russian foreign office said in 
Moscow today that internationalization of the Kashmir issue will 
not help resolve this issue. This problem should be resolved by 
India and Pakistan by working together. 
  Mr. B.M. Yogorov, the chief of South Asian Bureau of the 
Russian foreign office emphasized in an interview today that the 
Kashmir problem was between India and Pakistan and it should be 
resolved peacefully. Mr. Yogorov said that the Shimla agreement 
can be used as a basis by India and Pakistan for resolving the 
Kashmir issue. 
  These comments by the senior Russian diplomat are very 
important against the background of Pakistan's recent campaign 
to make Kashmir an international issue. 
  Mr. Yogorov forcefully said that Russia always had the same 
stand on Kashmir and it does not see any reason to change this 
stand. 
  He said that there are two aspects of the Kashmir 
problem--political and human rights. However, these two should 
not be mixed.

<F P=106> [Article by Said Naqvi: "Delhi's Brave Start to Putting </F>
Srinagar Back on the Path to Governance"] 
  [Text] The human rights drama being staged in Geneva will 
complete its run by the second week of March. The focus of 
everyone's attention, however, will be the steps Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao will take regarding the situation in Kashmir. The 
developments related to New Delhi and Srinagar will take place 
under his personal supervision. 
  Skeptical people will ask, "How do you know?" After all, 
there was never so much unawareness as there is now in the 
capital of what the prime minister wants. I can say, referring 
to a very reliable source, that one month ago, the prime 
minister had taken all of the Kashmir-related issues into his 
own hands. 
  The people who had been associated with Kashmir's 
administration until now are amused by the prime minister's 
direct interest in it. They argue that General Krishan Rao, 
Kashmir's governor, talks directly only with the prime minister. 
He does not even have time to talk with Home Minister Chavan or 
the Home Minister for State, Rajesh Pilot. The fact is that if 
either of them had any clout, he would have already been removed 
from the position of governor. After that, they would have been 
busy trying to push each other out and, following the Lucknow 
etiquette, asked one another to go first. By taking the Kashmir 
affair into his own hands, he has cleared up the rumor that he 
was removing the governor from his position. 
  The governor is still there. The people in the North Block 
who had bombarded the governor with accusations have pointed 
their cannons toward the governor's assistant now that the 
situation has changed. The balls of accusation are aimed at 
Sheikh Ghulam Rasul, the chief secretary of Jammu-Kashmir 
affairs. He is accused of being like a strange courtier who 
first won the governor's confidence with his cunning and then 
tried to dethrone him. The argument is that the chief secretary 
does not allow the governor to do what he wants to do. The list 
of accusations continues, and there are about 80 government 
employees who do not even go to work but still draw their 
salaries every month, thanks to the chief secretary. There are 
quite a few employees of the Jammu-Kashmir police who are 
working in cahoots with the terrorists. Until they are 
controlled, the Central Reserve Police and the Border Security 
Force cannot work closely with the local police, because the 
fear is that all their plans are forwarded to the terrorists. 
  After the peaceful resolution of the Hazratbal crisis, there 
were indications that the Kashmiri people wanted a normal 
situation in the valley. The administration there, however, was 
not the kind which respected their wishes and followed up on 
them. No attention was paid to accounts for four years. Now the 
chief secretary is being blamed for part of this poor 
administration, breaking various rules and regulations (which 
used to be blamed on the governor before), and hindering the 
government's work. 
  The situation [here described] in Kashmir is not based on my 
own observations. I have not visited the valley for some time. I 
have based my conclusion on what I have heard from the 
politicians and officials who have visited Kashmir. 
  How will the prime minister proceed with this affair? He 
will 
talk with the governor and announce that it is very important 
that Sheikh Ghulam Rasul remain in his present position. The 
intelligence bureau report will be presented in detail. Until 
the chief secretary is removed, the terrorism in the valley will 
not end. 
  At one point, it was a common belief that the British and 
the 
Americans believed that Pakistani assistance to Kashmiri 
terrorists had started to come from across the border. 
Siddhartha Shankar Ray complained to U. S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher in their sole meeting that Pakistan was 
helping Kashmiri terrorists and encouraging them. He was given 
the answer, "According to our information, this is not happening 
now." 
  Our diplomats have begun to strongly believe that Western 
intelligence can get information only to an extent, and not more 
than that. Therefore, as the Indian sources indicate, Kashmiri 
terrorists are still getting help from outside, and we should 
take this information seriously. The fact is that the permanent 
secretary of the British Foreign Commonwealth Office, Sir David 
Gillmore, repeated the same comments given by Prime Minister 
John Major during his trip to New Delhi last year. He said, "We 
believe that the best way is to find a solution according to the 
Shimla Agreement. Steps should be taken to implement a sincere 
political process by talks, respect human rights in Kashmir, and 
stopping outside aid to the terrorists which is creating most of 
the problems." 
  According to one analysis, the mercenary terrorists across 
the border are facing a new problem. There is such a heavy 
concentration of Indian soldiers on the border that the 
mercenary soldiers, if they enter Kashmir, find it difficult to 
go back. This analysis indicates that those terrorists are 
acting like daredevils. 
  When the prime minister sits down to review the situation, 
he 
will find that the basic facts cannot be clouded by analysis. 
One fact is that there still exists the feeling of our being the 
outsiders among the people who live in Kashmir. Because of the 
lack of information among our security forces, they committed 
atrocities against the people, which strengthened this feeling. 
  When the prime minister talked with Muslim ministers, 
senators, and others about Kashmir and invited them to find a 
solution, this issue was raised again during the talks. The 
following people participated in this discussion: Jaffar Sharif, 
Ghulam Nabi Azad, Salman Khursheed, Ahmed Patel, Saifuldin Sauz, 
and Farooq Abdullah. 
  The prime minister is making Farooq Abdullah the New Delhi 
spokesman for Kashmir. One thing he will understand very soon is 
that we kept the DULF [expansion not given] leaders in Sri Lanka 
so close to us that they lost the respect of the Tamils there. 
This resulted in the rise of the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam]. We know that Farooq Abdullah is not very popular 
in the valley. Perhaps by appointing him spokesman for human 
rights in the Geneva Human Rights Conference, we have totally 
destroyed his credibility in the valley.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kanchan Gupta] </F>
  [Text] For a long time now, it has been clear that both the 
Government of Pakistan as well as certain organizations have 
been playing an active role in instigating and organizing 
violence in the Kashmir Valley apart from preaching separatism 
among the people. India has extensive documentation to prove 
this point and the material has been presented to Western 
governments as evidence of Pakistan's role in sponsoring 
transborder terrorism. 
  There have been detailed reports filed by independent 
journalists to further substantiate Pakistani complicity in 
disturbing the peace in Kashmir. However, every time such 
evidence is made public, either by the Government of India or 
the national media, Pakistan has been prompt in denouncing it as 
a propaganda. Ironically, it is the Pakistani media which has 
now begun to publish reports that provide indisputable evidence 
of Islamabad's support to terrorists. For instance, the FRONTIER 
POST, a well-known newspaper published from Peshawar and Lahore, 
has been publishing a series of articles and news reports which 
reveal the extent to which fundamentalist religio-political 
parties and organizations that enjoy official and quasi-official 
patronage have been sending across trained young men to Kashmir. 
The newspaper has also reported how some of these organizations 
whose camps are attended by Pakistani Army officers have been 
planning the kidnapping and killing of security personnel on 
duty in the valley. 
  All this, of course, is not news as far as India is 
concerned. There can be no doubt that the ISI [Inter Service 
Intelligence] is not the only Pakistani outfit which has its 
fingers firmly in the Kashmiri pie; so have the Jamaat-i-Islami 
and its allied organizations. Yet, the Pakistani Government led 
by Ms. Benazir Bhutto has have no compunction in trying to make 
political capital out of the strife and violence that is a 
handiwork of its agencies. 
  At the ongoing UN Human Rights Commission conference in 
Geneva, Ms. Bhutto has sought to propagate the Pakistani 
allegation of human rights violations resorting to the old 
tactics of repeating a lie again and again so that it appears to 
have a kernel of truth. But the propaganda blitz is unlikely to 
cut much ice. Now that even the Pakistani media has begun to 
divulge the truth, it is only a matter of time before the cat 
leaps out of the bag. It will not be surprising if following 
the spate of reports in the Pakistani newspapers Islamabad 
decides to impose press censorship to suppress the cold facts. 
But all this can only have a cosmetic effect for there is no 
power which can suppress the truth for ever, and the truth is 
that Pakistan driven by territorial greed is instigating and 
fanning violence in Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Article by Prakash Singh, former director general of Border </F>
Security Force: "To Win the Kashmir War"] 
  [Text] Kashmir represents the greatest threat to national 
security today. The separatist movement constitutes the biggest 
challenge the country has faced to its unity and integrity since 
the dawn of Independence. Is the problem intractable? Is there 
no way out? Are we sinking into a quagmire? I don't think so. I 
believe that if some hard decisions are taken, the situation 
will definitely change, and from the long term point of view, 
for the better. 
  There is no getting away from the grim reality that 
infiltrations will have to be stopped or at least very 
substantially reduced if we are to contain militancy in the 
valley. The security forces, despite the fact that they operate 
in an unfriendly and inhospitable environment, are doing a 
commendable job. Militants are being apprehended and liquidated 
every day. Seizures of arms, ammunition and explosives is a 
continuing process. Their figures make an impressive tally. 
  The fact remains that Pakistan has been replenishing the 
militants' losses. It is a running battle between losses 
suffered by militants on one hand and fresh induction of trained 
personnel, Kashmiri and other nationalities on the other. Our 
objective must be to see that losses are more than the 
accretions. It is difficult to say if we have arrived at that 
balance yet. We have to remember that Pakistan has been pumping 
in enormous resources to keep the Kashmir pot boiling. 
  That being the situation, it is essential that the movement 
of men and material across the line of control is reduced to a 
trickle. This was achieved in Punjab. Today, when people talk 
with a sense of euphoria over terrorism having been contained in 
that state, they forget that it happened only after the border 
was virtually sealed by barriers, human and artificial ones, 
ensuring that the supply of oxygen in the form of weaponry and 
infiltration was choked. Once that happened, the flame of 
terrorism naturally withered. 
  How do we translate that in the situation obtaining in 
Kashmir? The border is being patrolled as effectively as it 
could be by the Indian Army and the BSF. Yet the configuration 
of hills being what it is infiltration continues. Fencing the 
undulating snow-covered peaks is impossible. My suggestion is 
that the valley should be fenced along the slopes of the hills. 
It would amount to raising a barrier along the points where the 
hills descend into the valley. The idea is that we should 
insulate the valley from the surrounding hills, particularly in 
the Pir Panjal Range. Once that is achieved, the security forces 
will be able to decimate the terrorists in the bowl. I am not 
saying that the hills should be cut off or left unguarded. 
Movement from the valley to the hills or vice versa should only 
be through gates which would be manned by the security forces 
and where any person going either way could be thoroughly 
frisked. The existing deployment of forces in the hill ranges 
should continue and operations not only sustained but also 
stepped up to the extent possible within the existing resources. 
  The strategy should be to stop infiltrations, deal with 
those 
who manage to enter the hills and, finally, prevent their entry 
into the valley at any cost. Fencing paid dividends in Punjab. 
There is no reason why it should not give results in Kashmir 
where the militants' losses are being made up all the time. 
Borders have to be secured and infiltration reduced to the 
minimum if we are to break the backbone of militancy. Beyond a 
point pumping in more battalions on internal security cannot 
lead us anywhere. 
  The Jamaat-e-Islami is the soul of militancy in the valley. 
We allowed this organisation to proliferate during the last 
several decades. "Madarsas" were opened by the Jamaat in every 
nook and corner of the state. The ideological indoctrination of 
the young minds caused havoc. The youth today frequently seen 
throwing stones or brandishing weapons are products of the 
"madarsas". It is unfortunate that when the seeds of poison were 
being sown, no action was taken and the State Government 
preferred to look the other way. 
  Jamaat-e-Islami provides the ideological motivation, 
sustains 
and supports the separatists. Unless we strike at this 
institution, it will be futile to expect militancy to be 
liquidated or even controlled. Jamaat-e-Islami is a banned 
organisation and yet no action has been taken against its 
members in J&amp;K. 
  It is unfortunate that the loyalties of a section of the 
government employees are open to question. They are like Trojan 
horses in our camp. The security forces feel particularly bitter 
about the attitude of these functionaries on sensitive issues. 
They feel hamstrung in their operational efforts in the absence 
of cooperation from the local administration. These government 
employees are an unashamed lot and their brazenness is shocking. 
Some even contribute a certain percentage of their salary every 
month to the militants' coffers. It is a perverse kind of 
peaceful co-existence. Their conduct is a great damper to the 
moderate and sensible Kashmiris who are puzzled that the 
Government does not take action against its own employees having 
a nexus with militant organisations. It is an open secret that 
several senior officers of the State Government signed a 
petition to the UNO against the Government of India a few years 
back. What loyalty or commitment could be expected of them is 
anybody's guess. 
  Why can't we take action against them under Article 311(2) 
and have these employees sacked? It is not necessary to sack all 
and sundry. Exemplary action against even fifty employees 
conveys the message. 
  If there is one lesson to be learnt from Punjab, it is that 
the State Police holds the key to tackling terrorism or 
insurgency. There is no doubt that the army and the paramilitary 
forces made tremendous contribution to controlling terrorism in 
Punjab. However, only after the Punjab Police was revived by 
Rebeiro and given the required punch by K. P. S. Gill did the 
tide turn. 
  Such a transformation is yet to take place in J&amp;K. The 
State 
Police has to demonstrate the will to fight the militants. It 
needs a strong injection of strength, perhaps from outside. We 
should be able to send hand-picked IPS officers for a minimum of 
one year tenure to serve in J&amp;K. Accelerated promotions 
could be 
the incentive. The modalities can be worked out, but the 
important thing is to give officers of appropriate calibre to 
the state at all levels. It is not that J&amp;K Police is 
incapable 
of taking on the militants. It is, however, thirsting for 
dynamic leadership. Once that is given, it would certainly show 
better results. 
  Time is running out fast in Kashmir. Pakistan is getting 
desperate. It is high time that a well-coordinated plan of 
action is worked out and pursued with vigour.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pakistan Warned Not To Raise Kashmir </F>
As An International Issue and Jeopardize Secretary-Level Talks"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 17 February -- India has warned Pakistan 
that if it presents the Kashmir resolution in the Geneva Human 
Rights Commission meeting, then foreign secretary-level talks 
between the two countries will be hurt. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today that if 
Pakistan 
continues to pressure for the introduction of this resolution, 
then bilateral talks will be endangered. The spokesman said, 
"The whole world knows that Pakistan has nothing to do with 
human rights in the Kashmir issue; it just wants to take 
political advantage of this issue." 
  The spokesman said that India was still intent on resolving 
the problem between the two countries through talks. He said 
that the prime minister has clearly indicated that India is 
committed to talking to Pakistan about Kashmir and all other 
issues. 
  The spokesman expressed the hope that Pakistan would not 
introduce the Kashmir resolution in Geneva. He said that India 
has already told all member nations about Pakistan's real reason 
for introducing the resolution. "All countries are aware of 
Pakistan's goal and also of Pakistan's involvement in Kashmir," 
he said. 
  Foreign Minister Salman Khursheed made it clear at the Human 
Rights Commission meeting yesterday that Pakistan is not 
qualified to talk about human rights, because its own record in 
this area is very bad. He said that India has supported 
bilateral talks on all issues in Pakistan; it also supports 
talks according to the Shimla Agreement. 
  He said that India sent a six-point proposal to Pakistan to 
increase mutual trust; however, Pakistan did not even consider 
sending a formal reply.

  [Excerpt] New Delhi -- Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
president L.K Advani on Thursday called upon the Government to 
tell the United States in clear and unambiguous language that 
its President Bill Clinton's observations on Jammu and Kashmir 
constituted an "un- friendly" act towards India. It amounted to 
an unwarranted and intolerable interference in the internal 
affairs of the country. 
  Advani reacted to Clinton's recent statements which were 
earlier criticised bv BJP spokespersons and its external affairs 
cell with a view to put the Kashmir issue into focus on the 
national agenda. The observations made by Clinton while 
accepting credentials of the Pakistani ambassador were totally 
against diplomatic norms as such occasions were never used to 
attack a third country, Advani said. 
  He reiterated that Kashmir was an integral part of India and 
the Indian people were confident of safeguarding its territory. 
He said the present US stand on Kashmir was against its earlier 
view in which it had recognised Kashmir as an integral part of 
India. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Vijaya Pushkarna: "Unsung Heroes"--quotation </F>
marks as published] 
  [Text] The state resembles a sprawling cantonment. Most of 
the vehicles seen on the roads belong to the security forces who 
have their bunkers after nearly every 300 metres. They have also 
taken on lease most of the cinema halls, hotels and commercial 
establishments in the towns. 
  The strength of the security forces deployed in the state 
has 
doubled between 1989 and 1991, after it was decided to seal the 
porous borders. In the three-tier system of defence, army jawans 
man the forwardmost areas; the second line is looked after by 
the BSF [Border Security Forces] while the BSF and the CRPF 
[Central Reserve Police Force] are deployed in the towns and 
villages. 
  The first success came when the infiltration of about 3,500 
Pak-trained militants was thwarted. They were forced to spend 
the winter across the border, with the cordon and search 
operations in full swing. The crackdown led to the nabbing of 
Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, the supreme commander of Al Umar. Altaf 
Qureishi, chief of the Ikhwan-ul-Musalmeen, was killed. And then 
came Sopore, supposedly a "liberated zone," which has been won 
back by the security forces, forcing many militants to flee the 
valley. 
  Around the same time, stray reports of the atrocities of 
militants on fellow Kashmiris started trickling in. The number 
of such complaints is on the rise. "A seven-year-old girl and 
five married women walked into a BSF bunker to escape some 
militiants who tried to molest them. We were able to catch the 
culprits and the women became our `cats' (informers). Two of 
them were later killed but we have given protection and jobs in 
the CRPF to the others," said an officer. 
  In Srinagar city, as in Sopore, it is the men of the BSF who 
are "holding on to the land." The bunker walls are made of sand 
bags, the roofs of tin. The flooring is generally the 
waterlogged slushy roadside and the air inside stinks, whether 
it is Chhattarbal, Saida Kadal or Karan Nagar. The freezing 
temperatures add to the woes of the security forces who have to 
keep a constant vigil. The shots can come from a window or door 
of any of the three-storeyed houses in all the four directions. 
  More than the cruel weather, it is the `virtual abandonment' 
by the government that the security forces lament about the 
most. "When our soldiers are killed by these cowards who use 
human shields there is no human rights violation. There is no 
good word for the restraint shown by us to ensure that no 
civilian is killed. And then to expect us to sit back and watch 
our men being fired at, whether in Bijbehara, or Kupwara! Where 
are our human rights?" asked an officer. 
  The recent killing of Maj Bhupender Singh of the Border 
Roads Organisation is cited as an example of the government's 
callous attitude to the man in the bunker. "When the government 
releases some guys it demoralises us. The pain becomes worse 
when we see that there is no consistent policy. For five days 
they were negotiating and bargaining over the life of Bhupender 
Singh. But he did not seem to matter," said a colleague of his. 
  The manner in which the Hazratbal incident was allowed to 
drift to has upset the forces. While it may have helped the 
government as far as world pressure was concerned, it was a 
setback for them. The militants used the 32-day siege to effect 
large-scale transfers of their men from one district to another. 
The `cats' or mukhbirs, who help identify the 
militants from the suspects rounded up, became helpless after 
that. 
  The security forces also feel that the government has not 
planned the anti-militancy drive well. The Punjab government, 
they point out, had announced big awards on the heads of wanted 
men, giving a share to the informers as well. Such an incentive 
would increase the list of informers, they argue. 
  Despite the strong resentment against the government, the 
forces have been moving around, trying to win back the 
Kashmiris. The BSF set up a clinic and posted a doctor to 
provide medical care to women and children in the downtown 
areas. But those who turned up were threatened by the militants. 
  For the security forces, it is a plain and simple war, where 
the enemy is well-armed, well-trained and well-funded. "If we 
die, we may get only an award," lamented a jawan. 
  It was clear that unless other inputs went into solving the 
Kashmir problem, the majority of the jawans posted to internal 
security duties would put in their papers at the earliest 
pensionable opportunity. "Given the fact that 45 battalions are 
posted in J&amp;K and that we have a two-year posting now 
(earlier 
it was four years), we will be back here after four years. For, 
a third of the BSF is deployed here," explained an officer.

<F P=106> [Article by Vijya Pushkarna: "Punjab No Model"] </F>
  [Text] Can Kashmir be brought around like Punjab was? It 
[is] not a question that New Delhi is asking itself, but a hope 
it is cherishing. The manner in which it handled the Hazbatbal 
crisis and the fact that some people are fed up with militancy 
have boosted the government's optimism, though casualties among 
the troops are increasing. 
  But there is little in common between Punjab and Kashmir, 
except the gun. 
  "Equating the two is doing us great injustice," says Prof. 
Abdul Gani of the Muslim Conference. "Punjab is an integral part 
of India, the Sikh's was a cultural revolt against the Hindus. 
Here it is a political problem. We don't say we are Muslims and 
so give us certain rights." 
  This view finds wide support in Srinagar. The people point 
to 
J&amp;K's [Jammu and Kashmir] disputed status, and the 
international 
interest in it, which were absent in Punjab's case. And they 
bluntly reject any package, economic or political, saying that 
they had never demanded concessions of any kind. 
  There is a host of other differences. Pakistan never claimed 
a right on Punjab, though it helped the militants, and the 
people of Punjab and Pakistan had nothing in common. Pakistani 
infiltration of Punjab was a fraction of what it has been in 
J&amp;K. While buses from Lal Chowk have taken boys to Rawalpindi 
and Muzzaffarabad, no such buses had gone from Punjab. The 
sealing of Punjab border was effective but it is impossible on 
the Kashmir border, from where one can trek to Muzzaffarabad 
overnight in summer. 
  The Punjab militant may have been far more deadly than the 
Kashmiri but he was backed by no more than 15 percent of the 
population. In Kashmir the security forces assess the support to 
be 60 percent. Till two years ago, the Kashmiri militant seeking 
shelter was given a hero's welcome, completed with a 36-course 
wazwan (feast) and there would be nightlong 
wunwun (music). The Punjab militant got nothing like 
that. 
  The police sympathise with the militants, the government 
officers give them a day's salary every month, and the 
politicians have decided to keep out. Even the judiciary is 
suspect. 
  Without the help of the police the security forces can do 
little. In Punjab it was J.F. Riberio and K.P.S. Gill who had 
called the shots, the security forces were merely assisting 
them. In Kashmir the army, BSF [Border Security Force] and CRPF 
[Central Reserve Police force] handle the law and order--a task 
for which they are not equipped. But they are confident of 
ending the problem in less than a year if the police really 
start working. 
  In Punjab the turnaround came when the difference between 
criminals and militants disappeared. In Kashmir the militants 
have not lost their heroic aura. For fear of agents provocateurs 
infiltrating their ranks and dirtying their organisations, 
militant leaders like Shabir Shah have ordered a thorough 
screening of every recruit. The people who are ready to take on 
the militants are just a handful, says a security officer. Some 
do it out of grudge, some are fed up with atrocities, some rat 
for a consideration. 
  Punjab was easier terrain. Most showdowns and encounters 
were 
in the open fields. There was not much chance of innocent 
citizens getting caught in the crossfire. In Kashmir, the 
militants fire from the windows and the security men are forced 
to shoot back at the buildings, harming innocents. "Even when 
they come out in the open and fire, they do it from behind a 
human shield, often of small children and women. We try not to 
harm the people, but if a jawan is killed, the others don't 
care," said an officer. 
  The demographic profiles, too, vary. In Punjab, the Hindus 
are only marginally fewer than the Sikhs, but in Kashmir the 
Muslims have overwhelming majority. Even Ladakh has 48 percent 
Muslims, and Jammu 34 percent. In Punjab, elections could be 
held with good Hindu and urban turnout; it preempted criticism 
that the government was unrepresentative. Any such effort in 
Kashmir will have little success. 
  Besides, there is the political vacuum. The politicians are 
reluctant even to visit the valley. In Punjab, at least a few 
parties carried on their campaign and shaped the public opinion. 
The CPI [Communist Party of India], the Congress and the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] paid a heavy price, but remained 
staunchly anti-terrorist. 
  Kashmir requires a different touch. Right now, no solution 
is 
possible without the involvement of the Huriyat Conference or 
some of its constituents. Hurried elections may only deepen the 
mire in a place where rigging has fuelled the fury. 
  Governor K.V. Krishna Rao has been trying to push the 
politicians into the valley. "They have been making all kinds of 
excuses, out of fear," he says. Gulam Nabi Shaheen, the Srinagar 
block president of the National Conference who lives in Jammu, 
believes that his party can play a mediatory role. But "for a 
political process to be successful, it is imperative that the 
government talks to Shabir Shah, Yaseen Malik and others. First, 
the guns have to be silenced, and all detainees released 
unconditionally," he says. "Elections now will achieve nothing." 
  Ali Mohammad Sagar, minister in Farooq's cabinet, too, lives 
in Jammu. "At least 20 ex-MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] 
have been killed," says Sagar who believes that bringing Farooq 
will not help. "Listen to people like Shabir Shah," he tells the 
government. "Many militant leaders are seasoned, educated, 
qualified and have a following. There are those who abhor the 
gun culture. If Laldenga and Prafulla Mahanta can be won over, 
why not these people? Don't make it a prestige issue, take a 
humane view." 
  Others too want Shabir Shah and Yaseen Malik to be won over, 
though they don't say it in so many words. Veteran Congressman 
Sardar Rangeel Singh, who was in the cabinet of Syed Mir Qasim 
and Sheikh Abdullah, says "the old leadership has become 
redundant" and former party general secretary Mangat Ram Sharma 
is for harnessing Muslim nationalist forces. 
  Says BJP leader Chaman Lal Gupta: "If we eliminate the gun 
and hold elections, leaders will be thrown up. If Shabir Shah 
and Yaseen Malik are elected to power under the Constitution of 
India, we should accept it. But it has to be a very fair and 
free election." 
  Members of the Huriyat pooh-pooh the talk of political 
process. "Any political process will have to be in a country 
outside India and Pakistan, with international guarantees," 
says Javied Ahmed Mir, acting chief of the Jammu Kashmir 
Liberation Front. Prof. Gani calls it a political prattle since 
a political process that does not address the basic issue of the 
dispute will serve no purpose. 
  According to Mian Abdul Quayoom, another member of the 
Huriyat, the only acceptable process involves demilitarisation 
of the region. UN trusteeship of it for five years, election of 
an interim government, and self-determination by the people. 
Huriyat chairman Mirwaiz Maulvi Umar Farooq too rejects a 
political process and Shabir Shah himself calls it nonsense. 
  Interestingly, there are people who assert that Farooq 
Abdullah is the de facto chief of the JKLF [Kammu Kashmir 
Liberation Front] and that it will do what he wants. Says 
Mushtaq Ahmed Lone, former National Conference MLA: "Dr Farooq 
Abdullah is a founder of the JKLF movement." The JKLF, however, 
has dismissed it as a canard. 
  Is Dr Abdullah, who recently paid a visit to Kashmir, still 
relevant otherwise? To New Delhi, he, being a nationalist, is a 
trump card to be played at international fora. Besides, people 
over 45 still have a sympathy for his party. And as Mangat Ram 
Sharma says he is a bird in hand and is better than two in the 
bush. 
  Whatever it be, most people believe that 1994 cannot be the 
election year in the valley. "Give me the choice between my job 
and being a returning officer, and I will quit," says a 
bureaucrat. Even the security forces say no elections will be 
possible in the very near future. "The people are too petrified 
to go to the polls," says an officer. 
  All the same, New Delhi may not depend on the advice of the 
security forces, partly because it feels that they have 
developed vested interests in militancy--even though it does not 
give credence to allegations that border tracts are put to 
auction for collecting fabulous sums offered by the militants as 
bribes to let them cross the border. Besides, with mounting 
international pressure, India may have to force certain things, 
as Home Minister S.B. Chavan has put it. 
<H5>  ABDUL GANI: MUSLIM CONFERENCE </H5>
  The 56-year-old professor of Persian was dismissed from 
government service in 1986, on the grounds that he was a 
potential threat to the security of the country. "A professor is 
a professor. He enjoys the academic freedom to talk, to express 
himself sufficiently on any subject," he says. 
  "In that capacity, I called a spade a spade. I considered 
all 
along that the Kashmir dispute would not only bring untold 
misery to the people of the state but also lead to wars between 
India and Pakistan. You can keep the people against their wishes 
for a time, not all time. That's a lesson I learnt from history. 
"The professor is unequivocal about his preference: accession to 
Pakistan. 
<H5>  MD ASHRAF SAHRAI: JAMAIT ISLAMIA </H5>
  The Jamait Islamia of J&amp;K may not be the biggest 
political 
party or constituent of the Huriyat Conference, but its power 
lies in the fact that its military wing, the Hizbul Mujahdeen, 
is the most dreaded outfit, with a cadre whose fire power is 
matched by its motivation. Though the Islamia talks about the 
Kashmiris' right to self-determination, it is in favour of 
Kashmir's merger with Pakistan. 
  That is why Mohammad Ashraf Sahrai, general secretary of the 
Islamia, has been attracting attention. "The only political 
parties in the war zone," he says, "are the Jamait Islamia and 
the Awami Action Committee." Incidentally, Sahrai is proud of 
protecting temples in Kupwara from an angry procession.

  [Text] Srinagar is a city sedated, groggy and gangrenous, a 
city where laughter has been ripped off the lips of its 
children. At six in the evening it looks like a sick man curled 
up under thick dark blankets, the shops have their shutters 
rolled down, the unlit streets have fallen silent and empty. "It 
is the first time in years that I am switching on the lights of 
my car," says Aijaz Ahmed, one of the lucky businessmen who has 
not yet been knocked into the pits of despair by the chaos that 
reigns in the valley. 
  Aijaz, 38, recently took his family from the sub-zero 
temperatures of Srinagar to Jammu, the sunny winter capital of 
the state. There their greatest source of joy was Tamil director 
Mani Ratnam's Roja, a film about the efforts of a 
woman to save her husband held hostage by Kashmiri militants. 
  The film is widely known in Srinagar, but not many have seen 
it thanks to the militants who have imposed a ban on cinemas and 
video libraries. They have also banned cultural programmes, 
clubs, beauty parlours and bars. Even a game of cards is sinful. 
During a house-to-house search by the security forces in 
downtown Srinagar, a Kashmir University lecturer has only one 
frantic plea to the officer. "Don't let anyone know that you 
have found video-cassettes in my house," she begs in tears. 
  It is mirthless life for the young and the growing. They 
live 
without fun, there is no entertainment, and even school day 
celebrations are a thing of the past. A bureaucrat, who paid 
heavily for openly sympathising with the militant movement, 
pities his children. "They are growing up in a well," he says. 
"They have no non-Muslims friends, they don't know what evening 
life is, what evening light is. My young son, most likely, will 
get killed looking for azadi." 
  A lot of things that the Kashmiris cherished have already 
died. Houseboat hospitality is foundering, shikaras 
have disappeared from the weed-grown Dal Lake, the tourist 
industry has collapsed, the economy has a huge hole in its 
heart. Yet Mohammad Amin Mir, owner of two houseboats, smiles. 
Offering tea and the warmth of the kangri to beat the 
biting cold, he says, "You have come here and spoken to us in 
English and Hindustani. For the first time in years, I almost 
feel as if a tourist is back." 
  The "years" that Aijaz and Mir are talking about is the 
period beginning December 1989, more specifically the day Rubiya 
Sayeed, the daughter of the then Union home minister, Mufti 
Mohammad Sayeed, was kidnapped by the militants. The owner of 
Welcome Hotel on the famed boulevard across the Dal Lake 
remembers how life began to deteriorate for him and others in 
the city from that day. "All our guests fled, even though they 
had booked the rooms for a week or more," he recalls. The next 
day, he closed shop. 
  Till then, he had thought that elections would be held and 
the situation would improve in the state that had been under 
President's rule ever since an angry Farooq Abdullah tendered 
his resignation over the appointment of Jagmohan as the 
Governor. In the next five days, the half a dozen three-star 
hotels on the boulevard were closed down. Many hotels all over 
the valley have met with the same fate. 
  The owner of Welcome Hotel entered the highly competitive 
carpet business, lost his money and has let rust eat his 
factory. Many other owners have rented out their hotels, earning 
handsome returns from the security forces--and death threats and 
ransom notes from the militants. Sandbag bunkers and 
gun-wielding men in olive greens and khaki--not camera-toting 
tourists in bright colours--mark hotels like Centaur. 
  Mohammed Amin Mir, the young houseboat owner who used to 
give 
tourists the Kashmir experience and earn Rs 1 lakh a season, 
today digs up the banks of the Jhelum for daily wages of Rs 30. 
There is no work on rainy and snowy days, and not all sunny days 
are productive. Firings and grenade-lobbing, which lead to 
hartals, often rob him of income and even if everything is fine 
he would not go far looking for work for fear of the bunkers 
along the way. 
  "We are able to survive on our savings and the meagre 
earnings. But how will I maintain the houseboats?" he asks. He 
has to spend Rs 6,000 to 8,000 for the maintenance of each boat 
every year. "Earlier it used to be six months work and six 
months rest. Now it is crackdown, curfew and hartal, at least 
three days a week," he says. 
  His uncle Ghulam Ahmad Khan hawks rubber slippers on the 
pavements on safe days. "Tonight is Shabbi Barat, a big day for 
us Muslims, when we go to the mosque and be there all night. But 
now nobody leaves the house, and every time I get back home, I 
think it is a rebirth," he says though he has never been picked 
up by the security forces. 
  A hundred of the 2,000 houseboat owners at Dal Lake have 
travel agencies to fall back on, the others have fallen flat. It 
is hard times even for Mohammad Iqbal Chapri, 79, the founder 
president of the Houseboat Owners' Association--his brother is 
the present president--and one of his sons and a grandson work 
as domestic help for some Swede engineers at Uri. The Chapri 
family did not turn to the carpet and handicrafts industry 
because they have been houseboat people for the last 250 years. 
Says Chapri: "A shawl person cannot manage a houseboat or 
trekking, and I cannot make and sell shawls." 
  It has been a road to despair for taxicabs, too. In 1989 
there were 4,000 of them in Srinagar and Badgam districts. Now 
there are only 1,700. "The television says the Mujahdeen do not 
let us accept the relief that the government is giving us. But 
the fact is that the government is not giving us anything, we 
have not even been exempted from paying the tax on the cabs," 
says G.M. Kundroo, general secretary of Tourist Taxi Stand 
Drivers Union. 
  While Kundroo blames the presence of the security forces for 
the poor tourist traffic and claims that the militants do 
nothing that hits tourism, many others think otherwise. Rashid, 
a houseboat-owner-turned-cabbie, was kidnapped by the militants 
along with two American botanists from whom they demanded Rs 5 
lakh. "but to our good luck, another group of militants 
intervened and we were let off," says Rashid, who has found the 
security forces more considerate than many militant groups. 
  The worst affected in the city seem to be the 
shikarawalas who used to ferry people down the Jhelum 
to houseboats in the Dal Lake. There are only a dozen 
shikaras at the Dal Gate Ghats which means most of 
the 1,800 workers are out of jobs. Their union secretary, Khazar 
Mohammad Kalu, a hunter of daily wages now, says many in his 
trade have migrated to Jammu, Goa and Delhi and that 400 
shikaras have been abandoned for want of money to 
repair them. 
  It is not only those in the tourism trade who have lost out. 
The bleakness has invaded everyone's bone-marrows. Tailor 
Mohammad Ayub Khan is out of work not because his Hindu 
customers fled the area, but because his shop is next to a BSF 
bunker. Khan, who had eight employees in the good old days, has 
no more [than] two uniforms to mend. The commanding officer of 
the BSF unit had recommended that Khan's daughter Yasimjan be 
employed by the district administration but, after many visits, 
he is a disillusioned man. "If I had the money to buy her a job, 
would I not have got her married?" he asks. The militants have 
not helped him either. "They are collecting money for 
themselves," he says. 
  Baskets woven by Ghulam Rasool Shaksaz, who lives near the 
Hazratbal mosque, used to be taken to Calcutta and other far off 
places by traders. Now the traders just don't come. Till a few 
months ago, he carried on making kangris for visitors 
to the mosque, which is now virtually closed. Yet he thanks 
Allah and cheerfully says: "The crisis has shown what a goldmine 
Kashmir is. People are carrying on without income. That shows 
the potential of the place." 
  Most business establishments in Srinagar don't open, and the 
businessmen have forgotten what credit, bilti, or LOC 
[line of control] means. The carry-and-forward agents of all the 
major companies have shifted to Jammu. Credit cards are of no 
use, most banks have closed down their branches. The few that 
have not, have massive security and endless queues. Indian 
Airlines does not sell tickets directly, STD [Subscriber Trunk 
Dialing (telephone)] and ISD [International Subscriber Dialing] 
booths are non-existent. Courier services deliver packets, but 
they cannot airfreight packets from Srinagar. 
  From sunset to eight in the morning, there is no movement of 
people, no light on the streets, and even the paramilitary 
vehicles do not turn on lights for fear of attacks. There is 
chronic power shutdown but even those who can afford generators 
do not go for them, for that would invite unnecessary attention, 
possibly dangerous, to the buyer. 
  The Dak Bungalow in Jammu had some visitors from the valley, 
who had come not to see Roja, but to play at cards! A 
good hand of rummy with four packs seem to be a favourite of a 
number of middle-aged Kashmiris, but they seldom play in the 
valley for fear of the son and his gun. "The militants have 
banned card games, and nobody knows whether his son is with this 
group or that. We play only behind closed doors in Srinagar and 
if there is a knock, we will hide the cards before opening the 
door," said a card game enthusiast. 
  The lack of trust, the lurking suspicion between sons and 
fathers, the young and the old, is part of the tragedy that is 
Kashmir. The old seem to be afraid of the young who are 
fascinated by the gun. They also fear for them. "If we send them 
out for work, the men in uniform may beat them to death; if they 
stay home, they are easily tempted by militancy. That is the 
problem of a father, the government just does not care," says 
Chapri, whose son Ibrahim was kept blindfolded by the security 
forces for 16 days in 1990. "As a freedom fighter, I have taught 
him that violence must be met with violence. My Quran has taught 
me that. If it is non-violence that I am faced with, I must 
submit. That is the way all of us here have been educated," he 
explains why militancy has captured the imagination of the youth. 
  But there are father who attribute the trend more to the 
prevailing political atmosphere than any kind of indoctrination, 
formal or otherwise. "Perhaps the new generation will be more 
violent. My son was six when militancy erupted. His life has 
been in the atmosphere of guns, rockets, and there has been a 
reduction in educational facilities and interaction with human 
beings. Only a psychotherapist can say what damage it has done," 
says a father who is anguished that the militants are using 
12-year-olds to throw grenades at their targets. Raised in such 
a deadly atmosphere such boys will find happiness only in the 
rattle of Kalashnikovs. 
  The boys seem to love it, proud of their self-image as 
freedom fighters. "I don't know how I got into this movement. 
Yes, it was in my blood," says Shefat Ahmed, a former student of 
the reputed Burn Hall boys school. He had been neither trained 
nor armed, but when "everyone rose, I was chased out into the 
movement by my family members, who asked me to be a man." He 
also notes that many top leaders of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Liberation Front [JKLF] were bright students. 
  There are bad eggs, everyone admits, the types that rape, 
loot and run wild. But most of the militants burn with the 
vengeful fury against security forces. For, many militants have 
been created by them, by roughing up an innocent man or 
misbehaving with a woman. Such humiliation makes all the boys in 
the family turn militants. 
  The crackdowns and house-to-house searches too have turned 
people against the government. A young man of Nawath, who has 
been arrested at least four times in the last one month, 
believes that it is only because he wears jeans and sneakers 
that the security forces think that he is a militant. Ghulam 
Amad Khan says his mentally retarded nephew was detained for 
three weeks. The alienation is growing, with 3,000 people in 
jail without trial for more than three years. 
  "It would have taken us 60 years to get the movement to this 
stage, but thanks to Jagmohan and the security forces, we have 
done it in three years," says a lawyer. Another militant mocks 
at Union Minister Rajesh Pilot's assurance that the relatives 
will be informed of arrests within 24 hours: "They are now 
producing bodies in the police stations within three hours. The 
number of custodial deaths is unimaginable." 
  The presence of the uniformed forces has hardly instilled 
confidence in anyone. A woman, who was initially happy that 
midnight knocks had ceased when the BSF set up a bunker near her 
house, fears that she would be caught in the crossfire. Army 
convoys on the streets are a regular sight even when there is no 
emergency. Recently there was a panic at a market where a row of 
jeeps screeched to a halt. In this case the fear was absolutely 
misplaced: the convoy was merely accompanying a major who had 
come to collect his clothes. 
  But no one takes chances, particularly after sunset. "If the 
security forces are ruthless during daytime, they are worse in 
the evenings when most of them are drunk," says a shopkeeper on 
Residency Road. The excesses by the militants are either brushed 
off as canards or ascribed to "guest militants"--Pakistani 
agents, PLO guerrillas, Afghan killers and the like. A newspaper 
report that the guest militants are spreading AIDS is read out 
by militants groups along with warnings about criminals 
masquerading as great revolutionaries. 
  The writ of the militants runs in the society despite the 
jawans crawling all over. "Their parallel courts matter much 
more than the courts of law," says Sheikh Mukhtiar Ahmed, who 
had won a case involving Rs 12 lakh. But then the militants 
backed the other party, and so the verdict is yet to be enforced. 
  The High Court Bar Association president Mian Abdul Quayoom, 
a member of the Huriyat Conference, says that there is 
accountability in the militant outfits. He gives an example: at 
Arwani near Bijbehara, a Hizbul Mujahdeen militant killed two 
people making love. The parents went to the Hizbul 
commander-in-chief, who then ordered the militant's execution. 
  Not everyone sees the militants in that glorious light. Says 
a bureaucrat: "We have a gun in front of us, a gun behind us. 
Anyone with a gun is supreme in Kashmir, whether he is in 
uniform or not. They are exempted from all rules, laws and 
civility." 
  The High Court has 8,000 habeas corpus petitions pending 
before it. In 1990-91, such petitions formed 85 per cent of all 
cases, 60 per cent the next year and 40 per cent now. "I don't 
say that the arrests have stopped, it is just that the interest 
of lawyers has swung back to more profitable cases. Most of them 
were handling these habeas corpus writs free," says an official. 
Quayoom alleges that the judges have been instructed to go slow 
on habeas corpus petitions. Says he: "In the normal course, a 
judge would write out the order on the toilet tissue if he got 
such a petition while sitting on the pot." 
  The collapse of all branches of government is complete, yet 
the valley seems very much like the giant chinar tres, waiting 
for the long and bleak winter in its history to be over, for new 
leaves to sprout and bring colour and life back. But the present 
is crushing, abject and hopeless, as the youth growing up in a 
traumatised land fondle grenades and the tense troops in sandbag 
bunkers flash terror. 
<H5>  YASEEN AHMED MALIK: PRESIDENT OF THE JKLF </H5>
  Yaseen Ahmad Malik, 26, has been in jail since 1990. But the 
incarceration has hardly weakened his will. During his college 
days, Yaseen founded the Student's League. "He was always an 
admirer of Maqbool Butt (hanged in 1984), though I don't know 
what exactly attracted him to the movement," says his sister 
Amina. 
  He was first arrested for taking out a procession to protest 
the dismissal of the Farooq Abdullah government. Released a year 
later, he was again arrested for reactivating the JKLF. When let 
off, Yaseen crossed over to Pakistan. He was netted again in 
August 1990. He can play a major role in shaping Kashmir's 
future but his health is feeble. He has had open-heart surgery 
while in custody. 
<H5>  SHABIR SHAH: PEOPLE'S LEAGUE </H5>
  Shabir Shah, 40, has spent almost half his life in different 
jails. He was arrested for the first time when he was 14: he had 
organised a demonstration against the visit of Jayaprakash 
Narayan to the valley. The J&amp;K [Jammu &amp; Kashmir] People's 
League, of which he is chairman, was formed a little before the 
Indira-Abdullah accord which brought the Sheikh back to power in 
1975. 
  Shabir traces his inclination towards secessionist movement 
to 1968, when "Balraj Madhok came and instigated us, but this 
feeling really grew in the 70s." He does not concede that the 
movement for self-determination is inspired by Pakistan. Now, 
the mainstream parties want the government to hold talks with 
him. 
<H5>  MIRWAIZ UMAR FAROOQ: AWAMI ACTION COMMITTEE </H5>
  Umar, 20, became the spiritual leader of the Muslims in the 
valley after the assassination of his father, Mirwaiz Maulvi 
Farooq, in May 1990. He is also the chairman of the Huriyat 
composed of 34 political and militant groups. "It was my idea to 
form the Huriyat," he says. 
  He addresses large crowds every week at the Jama Masjid in 
Srinagar, where two lakh people gather on the last Friday of the 
Ramzan month. Every Wednesday a professor comes to his house to 
help him prepare the speech. And every day three other 
professors come to teach him Arabic, Islamic Law, Persian and 
other subjects in his fazilat degree course. He is 
also studying for graduation in political science. 
<H5>  JAVIED AHMAD MIR: ACTING CHIEF, JKLF </H5>
  A hat and a pair of tinted glasses are part of Javied Ahmed 
Mir's camouflage. Being on the run has become a way of life for 
him. He manages to address public meetings without attracting 
the attention of the security forces. 
  Javied set up the Islamic Students' League in 1982 and later 
found a job in the public health engineering department. He has 
been in and out of the jails for the last four years. The last 
stint, which was eight months long, was in the Jammu jail with 
Shabir Shah of the People's League, and his own party chief 
Yaseen Ahmed Malik. 
  Javied, 33, claims he has never held a gun. "I belong to the 
political wing of the movement, not the military wing," he says.

<F P=106> [Article by Barun Sengupta: "American Official's Love of </F>
Pakistan"] 
  [Excerpt] American Officials are gradually strengthening 
their love for Pakistan. The anti-Indian component of this love 
for Pakistan is apparent in their Kashmir policy. 
  The recent round of U.S. love for Pakistan began 
intensifying 
after Bhutto returned to power. U.S. expressions of love before 
this were more subdued. Now, the United States is beating the 
drums and openly offering its love. The United States supported 
Pakistan at the time of the Bangladesh war. The United States 
failed at that time to protest the extensive atrocities and 
murders of civilians committed by the Pakistani army in 
Bangladesh. On the contrary, the Pakistani military leaders 
received assistance. After India defeated Pakistan in the 
Eastern Theater of war [Bangladesh], the United States made all 
types tof arrangements to assure that India would not advance on 
the Western Theater [Pakistan]. The United States,though, had 
not then openly supported Pakistani statements on Kashmir. Now 
they are. They have stated that Kashmir cannot be considered an 
indisputible part of India. The United States is not even 
prepared to recognize the part of Kashmir under Indian control 
as a part of India. Their position is that all of Kashmir is 
disputed territory. 
  Apart from that, recently, the U.S. Government has shed a 
lot 
of tears over Kashmir and how the Indian Government has curbed 
Kashmiri rights and is committing atrocities. Even Clinton is 
claiming how pained he is over all this. The reason the U.S. 
Government has suddenly become agitated over Kashmir is its 
newfound love for Pakistan. If U.S. officials were not under 
pressure to appease Pakistan, then why would they be crying so 
much? The main reason for their tears is to avoid criticism by 
Pakistan and the Muslim world. 
  There is no doubt that democracy is deep-rooted in American 
society. They do not want to see people deprived of democratic 
rights. Americans become very agitated upon hearing that human 
rights are being violated and governments are torturing their 
people. But there is no reason to believe that the U.S. 
Government is fond of human rights. U.S. foreign policy is based 
on American economic interests. They show interest in the 
abrogation of human rights when American economic interests are 
involved. When these interests are involved, they make a hue and 
cry all over the world. 
  There are many examples of this in history. Despite this, 
the 
United States continues on this path. One example is when the 
United States some time back made a big fuss over human rights 
violations in China. Now they have shut up. They are worried 
about losing markets in China. Thus the United States simply 
cannot worry about the lack of progress in human rights there. 
  U.S. officials never raise the subject of Saudi Arabia's 
lack 
of democracy or how torture is practiced there. This is due to 
the Saudis' willingness to keep in mind U.S. economic interests. 
When Khomeyni took power in Iran, however, U.S. officials became 
worried due to his unwillingness to protect U.S. interests as 
had the Shah. [passage omitted giving other examples] 
  Now, the United States is suddenly worried about Kashmir! 
The 
concern shown by the United States over human rights violations, 
however, is really an expression of concern over economic 
interests there. The United States wants to establish economic 
domination over Pakistan and needs a military base in Kashmir. 
Thus, the United States is about to restore aid to Pakistan. The 
United States wants to take steps to appease Pakistan and the 
Muslim world. 
  U.S. officials regard the Kashmir problem as a religious 
issue for most of the world's Muslims, a jihad to free Muslims 
from Kafirs. They believe that world Muslim sentiment is 
involved in this matter. This is why the United States is 
supporting the Pakistan position. 
  This explains why U.S. officials are silent over the support 
for militants which Pakistan offers year after year, creating a 
nightmare in the region. They have not uttered a word about 
about the atrocities committed by Pakistani militants in 
Kashmir. They have not uttered a word about the pitiful plight 
of Hindus and Buddhists who have been driven from 
Muslim-majority areas. This despite being the same U.S. 
officials who threatened Pakistan with terrorist-state 
designation just some time ago. 
  The question arises, why is the United States such a lover 
of 
Pakistan and appeaser of Muslims? There are many reasons. 
  First, the United States wants a military base in Kashmir in 
order to keep an eye on the oil-exporting regions of the 
Middle-East and Russia. U.S. economic interests in these regions 
is vital. A military installation would allow U.S. planes and 
military forces to be rapidly deployed in support of U.S. 
interests. 
  The United States is very worried about miltant Islam. They 
view with alarm the regime in Tehran. They know that anti-U.S. 
sentiment amongst Muslims is still very high after the Gulf War. 
The Muslim World is not content with simply being regional in 
scope, they want a place on the world stage. The United States 
is willing to appease this wish to gain the support of the 
majority of Muslims. 
  The United States, by allowing the Muslim world to grow 
stronger, also creates a check on Russia, India, and China. 
Thus, these countries will not be able to oppose U.S. economic 
imperialism. 
  This is why I have written that U.S. tears shed for Kashmir 
are not due to human rights violations. They are shed with a 
view to advancing U.S. economic interests.

  [Text] Jammu, February 19 (PTI)--The Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) President, Mr. L.K. Advani, said today India must convey a 
"clear and loud message" to all concerned, including militants, 
Pakistan and international community, that "Kashmir is an 
inalienable part of the country and is non-negotiable." 
  Addressing a press conference here soon after his arrival 
from New Delhi, Mr. Advani said "we must tell the United States, 
which has been trying to pressurise India into making some 
concession on Kashmir, that India regards accession of Jammu and 
Kashmir to it as final and irrevocable. 
  He said the BJP was bringing a resolution in the Parliament 
in this regard and expected unanimity of all members of the 
Parliament on Kashmir issue. 
  The country as a whole has to dispel the impression of 
international community that it could pressurise India on any 
count with regard to Jammu and Kashmir and the countrymen have 
to see that any compromise on Kashmir will have adverse effect 
on the country's integrity and unity, he said. 
  The BJP leader criticised the Centre, particularly the 
external affairs ministry, for its failure to present properly 
the Indian case relating to Kashmir before world fora. 
  The United States, which favours the idea of independent 
Kashmir for its own interests, has been making unfriendly 
pronouncements and so there was no reason why the Centre should 
not take them seriously, Mr. Advani said. 
  The external affairs ministry could not afford to ignore the 
statement of United States' officials, including President Bill 
Clinton, who has virtually endorsed Pakistan's viewpoint on 
Kashmir, he said. 
  He said the biggest misnomer with the international 
community 
was the identity of Kashmir with a section of population in 
Kashmir valley without realising that Jammu and Kashmir 
comprises three regions with different religious and linguistics 
groupings. 
  The Central government should have brought it to the 
knowledge of the international community along the plight of 
nearly 2.50 lakh [250,000 thousand] displaced Hindus from Valley 
due to the proxy war waged by Pakistan. 
  "There cannot be greater case of suppression of human rights 
that almost entire minority community of Hindus from Kashmir has 
become refugees in their own country and still the Centre keeps 
speaking on human rights in an apologetic way," he said. 
  Pakistan is responsible for violation of human rights in 
Kashmir where so many thousands of people got killed due to 
sponsored militancy from across the border and security forces 
were fighting this proxy war with tight hands. 
  Mr. Advani said he met recently two British ambassadors to 
India and Pakistan in New Delhi and explained them his party's 
viewpoint on Kashmir. 
  Replying a question on Kashmir, the government, headed by 
Mr. 
Narasimha Rao, should quit in view of, what he called, its 
failure on the Kashmir issue, Mr. Advani said. 
  However, he blamed the Centre for its policy on Kashmir from 
the late 1989 when the first episode of kidnapping of Dr Rubiya 
Sayeed, the daughter of the then home minister, Mr. Mufti 
Mohammad Sayeed, took place. 
  He alleged even on the Hazratbal issue, the Centre acted 
badly by releasing militants, including Pak officials. 
  Asked if Dr Farooq Abdullah could play a positive role in 
the 
present situation, Mr. Advani said "the basic issue is absence 
of policy and perspective and not the individuals, bankruptcy of 
policy could lead to more complications as it has been happening 
all these years," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Sankarshan Thakur: "Through a Kashmir Prism"] </F>
  [Text] Few among the Youth Congress supporters tossing a 
bloated effigy of Mr. Bill Clinton at Wagah last fortnight would 
have realised the symbolic significance of their protest. The 
image of Mr. Clinton being desecrated on the Indo-Pakistani 
border was a statement on how yoked relations between India and 
the United States remain to Pakistan. After all, it was not Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto's effigy being bandied around at Wagah. It was 
the U.S. head of state's. 
  Pakistan remains the thorn in India's side. The U.S. remains 
the prime agitator of that thorn in India's flesh. Consider how 
manageable Pakistan would be if the United States was taken off 
the scene. Handling Islamabad suddenly begins to appear so easy. 
None of that transcontinental arm twisting from Ms. Robin 
Raphel. None of those irritable "My dear Ghulam" letters from 
the Oval Office. None of those words of encouragement to 
secessionist elements in Kashmir and Punjab. 
  There was a time Pakistan looked manageable even with U.S. 
backing -- as long as the Soviet Union was around. Nothing 
deterred India from liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan, not 
Messrs Richard Nixon or Henry Kissinger, not even the U.S. 
Seventh Fleet. 
  But things have changed since then. And South Block gives 
the 
impression it has not quite adjusted to these changes. The 
Soviet Union is a thing of the past. The great protector is no 
longer hovering behind India's shoulders. There is no longer the 
assurance of a Soviet veto at the United Nations security 
council to shield India from U.S. bullying. 
  Russia votes with Washington at the UN on resolutions deemed 
anti-Indian in New Delhi. On the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
and the missile technology control regime, Washington and Moscow 
have the same thing to tell India. Sign on the dotted line. 
Hence Russia's stalling the sale of cryogenic rocket technology 
to India under pressure from the United States. Even on Kashmir 
Moscow's position lies closer to Washington's than New Delhi's. 
  India can no longer behave like a foetus in a protected Cold 
War womb. It needs to brave the new world and walk a hard path 
alone. The Clinton administration has done little of late that 
would not leave India wondering about US intentions in the 
region. The pinpricks have not been limited to the outbursts of 
Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant secretary of state for south Asia. 
Mr. Clinton himself has repeatedly left South Block aghast, most 
recently with his statement to the incoming Pakistani ambassador 
to the United States. 
  Often representations to Mr. Clinton, like the recent one on 
Punjab from a set of congressmen, have been products of myth and 
ignorance. The letter referred to Punjab as the "Republic of 
Khalistan" and spoke of 110,000 deaths in the state. If the US 
president responds to such propaganda with kind lines of 
cooperation, he is bound to raise hackles in South Block. 
  But then, like it or not, the US is in a position to get 
away 
with myth and ignorance. Such is the position it has come to 
enjoy, particularly after the demise of the Soviet Union. It 
does not serve to merely rail against a position, however false 
and unjust, that the United States takes. 
  The present lot of disconcerting noises from Washington has 
sparked a debate in the foreign office on whether the prime 
minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao, should go to the United 
States for a summit meeting with Mr. Clinton. There are camps 
for either side of the argument. But the reigning opinion in 
South Block seems to be Mr. Rao should not make the trip unless 
he wants his "nose rubbed in the ground," unless he is 
"soliciting a blow to national honour". The debate is rather 
presumptuous, if not also self-defeating. 
  It is not as if the U.S. administration is waiting with a 
red 
carpet to welcome Mr. Rao, terribly anxious to get bilateral 
irritants out of the way. As it is Mr. Clinton has little time 
for foreign policy matters and India would figure fairly low on 
his list. It would hardly bother the White House if Mr. Rao were 
to decide not to go. It has been argued the prime minister's 
decision not to visit Washington -- and go to Moscow instead -- 
would send the right signals of annoyance to the United States. 
What is more likely to be the case is there will be nobody in 
Washington bothered enough to receive the signal. 
  Rightly or wrongly, the onus for correcting the current 
imbalances in Indo-U.S. relations is on India. If India can say 
it is not bothered about bad relations with the United States, 
Washington would be even less so. The question is what will 
India lose if its prime minister visits Washington for a meeting 
with the U.S. president. The situation does not become worse if 
a Rao-Clinton summit does not produce a positive turn in 
relations. 
  The truth is India does not matter to the United States as 
much as the United States matters to India. 
  Besides, as representatives of the U.S. administration, 
including the belligerent Ms. Raphel and the U.S. charge 
d'affaires in New Delhi, Mr. Kenneth Brill, have pointed out, 
there is more to Indo-U.S. relations than just Pakistan and the 
linked issues of Kashmir and human rights. If New Delhi chooses 
to look at Indo-U.S. ties merely through Pakistan-Kashmir prism 
it will only hurt itself. 
  As far as the United States is concerned India could only 
benefit from continuously intensifying its economic and trade 
relations. This is something the United States too appears keen 
on. The United States is sending a high level trade delegation 
led by the commerce secretary, Mr. Ron Brown, in August. The 
effort should be to use such opportunities to expand Indo-U.S. 
contacts in other spheres, rather than allow Pakistan or Kashmir 
to overshadow all aspects of bilateral ties.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Not Wanted in Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] The offer of the Islamic Conference Organisation 
[ICO] to mediate in the Kashmir dispute is a cruel diplomatic 
joke which has been rightly spurned by New Delhi with the 
contempt it deserves. No other foreign body has given such solid 
and consistent support to Pakistan in setting the Kashmir valley 
virtually ablaze in the last four years as the lCO. What has 
suddenly made its Saudi-funded secretariat change its tune and 
posit itself as a peace-maker? The ICO Secretary-General, Dr Al 
Gabid, has a long record of indulging in anti-Indian propaganda 
at Pakistan's behest. It is he more than anyone else who has 
helped Pakistan manipulate the ICO to get anti-Indian 
resolutions passed at its meetings. He is again being true to 
his commitment to the cause of Pakistan in accusing India of 
grave human rights violations in Kashmir on the eve of the UN 
Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. Yet, the ICO has the 
temerity to offer mediation. This is akin to Pakistan's own 
terrorist trainers posing as a detached party solely concerned 
with bringing peace and harmony to Kashmir. 
  It is possible that a few balanced members of the ICO are 
secretly not quite happy with the way Pakistan has misused the 
organisation for its own anti-Indian designs. Indeed some of 
them have individually sought to allay New Delhi's suspicions 
about their bonafides by claiming to have worked behind the 
scenes to moderate the anti-Indian resolutions introduced by 
Pakistan in the past. But even if this were true, the more 
important issue is that the ICO just has no locus standi in the 
Kashmir dispute. Its concern for alleged human rights violations 
is only a pretence. Apart from the fact that this is simply a 
ruse to play the Pakistani game, would it not be more relevant 
for ICO to confine its attention to large-scale human rights 
violations in the very Islamic countries it represents? After 
all, even Pakistan has been indicted by both its own human 
rights activists and foreign organisations. 
  The ICO's avowed interest in protecting human rights may 
have 
been a little more credible if it had routinely raised its voice 
against shocking cases of barbarism in the Islamic world. These 
include the use of poison gas against the Kurdish rebels in 
Iraq, air-raids on the Kurdish minorities in both Iraq, and Iran 
and the unending agony of the Shia minority in the marshes of 
southern Iraq. At present, Afghanistan is easily the worst case 
of an entire country having become a virtual hell for its 
population. The ICO has done precious little to rectify matters. 
Has it bothered at least to mount a humanitarian effort on the 
requisite scale to send succour to the Afghans? Dr Al Gabid and 
his friends in the ICO secretariat are apparently far too busy 
in political intrigues in Geneva on behalf of Pakistan to devote 
time and energy to all trivial pursuits.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pulling the United States"] </F>
  [Text] There was a time when European rulers frequently 
used to refer to the phrase "the white man's burden." Those 
were the days of imperialism. By this burden they meant the 
black people of Africa and Asia. These colonial rulers 
considered themselves the guardian of the black people. It is 
true that these blacks were a cause of anxiety for their white 
masters. Although those days are gone, there is no reason to 
heave a sigh of relief. At present, the two neighboring 
countries in the Indian subcontinent, which have become engaged 
in a dispute over the Kashmir issue, are willing to accept the 
United States as a mediator to resolve the discord. This 
reminds us of the bygone days of imperialism. Benazir Bhutto is 
pulling one hand of President Clinton while the other is being 
pulled by Narasimha Rao. This is a matter of great delight for 
President Clinton as the United States wants to be the only 
protector of the world. What consolation or satisfaction does 
Islamabad or New Delhi gain by doing all this? What special 
gains do they expect by calling upon the United States to 
mediate their dispute? The finance committee chairman of the 
U.S. Senate and former U.S. ambassador to India, Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, was told by Prime Minister Narasimha Rao that all 
bilateral disputes between India and Pakistan should be resolved 
in accordance with the Shimla Agreement. He also urged the 
United States compel Pakistan to sit down for a dialogue to 
resolve this issue. On the other hand, Pakistan is saying that 
the situation in Kashmir is gradually becoming explosive. It 
wants the United States to exert pressure upon India so that an 
early settlement is reached on this issue. 
  It must be said that a big game is being played with the 
Kashmir issue. If New Delhi wants to inform the world community 
about the involvement of Pakistan in the militancy in Kashmir, 
it should do this work properly and stop issuing contradictory 
statements. Otherwise, this country will have to face a lot of 
miseries. It should be admitted that Indian diplomacy has 
failed to deal properly with the Kashmir issue and Pakistan is 
taking advantage of this situation. Pakistan is using the 
United Nations and the Islamic Conference Organization to 
achieve their designs. It is also approaching anti-Indian 
officials in the U.S. administration and pleading for the 
protection of human rights in Kashmir. India has done the right 
thing by rejecting the offer given by the Islamic Conference 
Organization to mediate in this issue. As Jammu and Kashmir is 
a state of India, the sovereignty of the country would have been 
violated had India accepted this proposal. It should also be 
realized by India that this is not the proper time to take a 
stubborn attitude on this issue. India should soften its stand 
and see whether the allegations of human rights violations is 
true or not. It would be wise to soften the Indian stand under 
international or U.S. pressure. There is nothing wrong in 
saying that India will not accept the illegal demands and evil 
designs of Pakistan. At the same time no one should be allowed 
to think that the attitude of India is self-contradictory.

  [Text] Jammu, 20 February (PR) -- Lal Krishna Advani, 
president of the Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP], told the Central 
Government and the Jammu-Kashmir government to get rid of the 
state's unsavory elements and give full freedom to the security 
forces to crush Pakistani-supported terrorism. 
  Mr. Advani, reading various reports from talks with several 
people, said that he has learned officials in the state 
government are, one way or another, encouraging terrorism in the 
state. He said that such disgraceful persons should be uprooted 
without haste. Mr. Advani was addressing a public meeting at the 
parade grounds. 
  Comparing the situation in the valley with Punjab, Mr. 
Advani 
said that the most important step needed to improve the 
situation in the valley is to give a free hand to officers in 
dealing with terrorism. He said that when such an arrangement 
was made in Punjab, the situation had improved rapidly. 
Additionally, the Central Government was watching Punjab closely 
during the terrorism era. 
  Mr. Advani said that the situation in Jammu-Kashmir is very 
different. Even the governor's mandate is not obeyed in the 
valley. The BJP leader told the Central Government that it 
should not hesitate to take strict action in Kashmir. Mr. Advani 
reminded his listeners that the Indian Government, despite 
international objections, had taken steps to test nuclear 
weapons in Sikkim, Goa, Hyderabad, and Pokhran. India has never 
bowed down to international pressures. Why, then, should it bow 
in the context of the valley?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Abhinav Kautilya: "Out of Line: The Issue is </F>
not Human Rights, but Clinton's Autocracy"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] When people who dropped 
nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and played with the lives of millions 
of innocent women, the elderly, the handicapped, and the sick, 
and made the earth there unproductive forever, are now talking 
about human rights in Kashmir, then it appears we are not 
listening to a president [Clinton] but to a sick person 
suffering from mental illness in an asylum. India, in comparison 
with the way the Americans cut down the Vietnamese like 
vegetables and grass, is miles away from sinking to this level. 
Clinton has said that terrorism and religious fundamentalism is 
nothing; the real thing is human rights. [passage omitted] 
  What is happening in Kashmir? One or two thousand crazed 
Pakistanis are shouting and carrying weapons in their hands, 
telling us that they will decide where they will live. This 
really is something. We do not have to accept what hundreds of 
thousands of voters want or the wishes of those who elected 
representatives to Kashmir's Vidhan Sabha and the Indian 
Parliament. Instead, we should listen to the people fighting a 
guerrilla war with weapons from Pakistan and the United States 
of America. The United States wants us to honor and pamper them. 
  The depth to which Mr. Clinton wants us to go down in 
relation to human rights is the same as we wish to follow. It is 
true that human rights belong to humans, but who are humans? 
Only those who follow truth, religion, non-violence, and are of 
good character and high ideals are humans. This is the old, 
accepted standard. Now we say generally that any person who 
believes in law and order is human. Anyone who is not human is a 
devil. If we ignore the old definition, then whoever ignores law 
and order is a non-citizen or inhuman. We can also say that 
person is a criminal. From this perspective, U.S. President 
Clinton is advocating the position of criminals in Kashmir. 
[passage omitted] 
  Human rights have not been defined by the United States, but 
by the United Nations. No other member of the United Nations has 
noticed any human rights violations; only the United States has. 
Now it seems that God has given all intelligence and vision only 
to Bill Clinton. It seems that Clinton is not only the President 
of the United States, but the greatest autocrat in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Punam I. Kaushish: "Openness Has Begun To Be </F>
Effective as a Weapon Against Militants in Kashmir"] 
  [Text] In the poker game there is a time when the players 
have to cash in their coupons. Narasimha Rao is doing the same 
thing in the context of Kashmir. Recently four European 
diplomats visited Jammu-Kashmir. This has brought forward a new 
policy that the policy-makers in the South Block have now 
adopted. 
  This transparent operation is important for two reasons. 
First, it shows clearly that India is open and does not hide 
anything. Second, the clear picture has emerged to the Western 
nations and they understand the situation better. At the same 
time the complications in the Kashmir issue will be brought to 
light. It is hoped that the Indian situation will be 
strengthened by it, because the main problem in Kashmir is the 
Pakistan-induced rebellion, and it will become fully clear. 
  It is to the Indian government's credit that it did not 
hesitate in giving permission to the European ambassadors to 
come to India and visit Kashmir so that they can talk directly 
with the people there. This way, India has proved itself to be a 
progressive democracy. At the same time, it has shown its 
serious intent to resolve the Kashmir situation within the 
framework of Indian Constitution. 
  We hope that this visit will open the eyes of Western 
nations 
to the fact that India is not at fault. Fortunately, those 
diplomats who toured the crisis-ridden state supported what 
India has been saying. 
  This was glimpsed in the changed attitude towards the 
Pakistani resolution in the Human Rights Commission meeting in 
Geneva. No doubt, Benazir Bhutto is trying to play the human 
rights card which Bill Clinton and his Western allies are tying 
to support. Still, this human rights issue is not making much 
progress. Some reports indicate that these countries have warned 
about the Islamabad resolution and have said that this will 
further deteriorate India-Pakistan relations and aggravate the 
tense situation in southeast Asia. 
  It is good for New Delhi that these diplomats have reacted 
positively. It is not known what their report sent to the 
European Union says. However, the talk in the diplomatic circles 
in New Delhi hints that this will strengthen India's position. 
  They talked with various people in the state and it helped 
India's side. They also learned how the Indian government and 
the state government officials have been struggling with this 
serious situation. They have come to the conclusion that, except 
for some unfortunate aspects, the Kashmir issue from the Indian 
perspective has not reached a point from where there is no 
turning back. No doubt, they have returned with the impression 
that the people in the valley are tired of the terrorists and 
desire return to normalcy. 
  There is another and more important facet. They have begun 
to 
feel that this situation would not have been created if external 
powers had not interfered in Kashmir. In other words, they have 
gotten proof of another Pakistani war against India. In this 
context, three of the four diplomats congratulated General 
Krishna Rao and his administration. They said, "Everyone we met 
praised General Rao and his efforts. No one said anything 
negative." 
  They have returned with he impression that the army, the 
Border Security Force, the Central Reserve Police Force, and the 
local police that are stationed there do not have appropriate 
training for dealing with terrorists. They were impressed that 
the authorities did not deny that some extreme actions were 
taken. They were also provided information about all the cases 
involving extreme activities about what action was taken in such 
cases. 
  There is no denying that these extreme actions started on 
the 
other side of the border. India tried to deal with the problem 
after that. In this chain of events the security forces broke 
rules. Still, it is clear that India did not take the 
initiative; it followed the policy of dealing with the other 
side's initiative. 
  It is also true that Pakistani fundamentalists attacked 
Indian security forces. The Indian troops acted in retaliation 
and Pakistan made a mountain of a mole hill. Still, it was a 
smart Pakistani political move to support terrorism on a large 
scale and keep it hidden from the world. 
  More than 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits are living as refugees in 
various corners of the country. They have suffered a lot. The 
diplomats received proof of it through their meeting with 
Kashmiri Pandits and the Muslims living in Jammu. The Western 
nations should not have any problem in understanding this 
situation because a similar situation exists in Bosnia. 
  The truth is that if India wanted to hide facts, it would 
not 
have permitted the diplomats to visit Jammu-Kashmir and given 
them a free hand. They met all those they wanted to meet. They 
visited the Hazratbal shrine and hospitals, and talked with the 
leaders of Huriat Conference for two hours. Despite the 
Pakistani propaganda, they went there on their own without any 
security forces with them. For example, a taxi was parked 
outside Hazratbal which took the four of them to meet the Huriat 
leaders. 
  They saw Pakistanis and Afghans in the hospital that the 
security forces have arrested. The diplomats said that those 
people were not invented by India. 
  When they were talking with some people in Hazratbal, only 
then did they hear the demand for freedom. About 100 people had 
gathered there and the number rose to 500 later. The Huriat 
leaders demanded a referendum according to the UN resolution. No 
one said that they wanted to join Pakistan or want to live 
independently. Their demand was: the right to self-determination. 
  Almost everyone expressed respect for Dr. Karan Singh. No 
one 
said anything positive about Farooq Abdullah. It appeared that 
nobody likes him. 
  There could not have been a better time for this visit 
because the Americans had adopted an anti-India attitude at that 
time. Now it is clear that we can respond to the propaganda that 
Pakistan was spreading about human rights violations to which 
President Clinton was putting his seal of approval without 
thinking. 
  The Americans have never considered this problem to be of a 
insurgence induced by terrorism. Perhaps they thought that if 
they admit this, then Pakistan's role in Kashmir and Punjab 
would be exposed. The fact is that Washington refuses to 
understand the complexities of this issue. Instead, it views the 
situation as though Indian troops occupying the valley were 
spreading a civil war there. Meanwhile, Islamabad is depending 
on its Muslim brothers. 
  The Pakistani politicians have used the human rights 
approach 
to realize their ambitions. The truth is that such violations 
have occurred in their country and they are looking the other 
way. Islamabad has accepted the figures on Kashmir that Amnesty 
International has given, however, it is looking away from the 
figures about Pakistan that this organization has compiled. This 
organization has clearly written about Pakistan that tortures 
and rapes were committed by the police and other forces on 
people in their custody and that it happens in many places in 
Pakistan. 
  Even the chairman of Pakistan's own human rights group has 
listed many incidents of torture in Pakistan. For example, 95 
incidents of violence against political activists in police 
custody and 55 incidents of rapes of innocent women and children 
were cited by this group. These figures are for the last two 
months. Most of these incidents took place in Sindh, Benazir 
Bhutto's home province. 
  Argentina's organization, the World Movement of Restoration 
of Human Rights, has also condemned incidents of human rights 
violation in Pakistan. The Kashmir Democratic Forum is an 
organization of progressive Muslims in Switzerland. It also has 
condemned Pakistan. This organization told Benazir Bhutto to 
leave Kashmir to the Kashmiris, because her interference is 
causing innumerable problems for the Kashmiris. 
  The U.S. State Department report is also very strong. It has 
hinted about unethical killing usually shown as confrontation 
with the police. Many incidents of misuse of police officers are 
noted and corruption is increasing. The police and the jailers 
use force to make people say whatever they want to hear. 
Innocent people are beaten and all kind of atrocities are 
committed. This is the story of Pakistani jails where people die 
and commit suicide. 
  Pakistan is still going on with its propaganda war against 
India while committing these sins. The European diplomats have 
seen that. New Delhi is going to focus on the Islamic world now. 
It is going to invite the diplomats from Islamic countries. They 
will tour the valley and see what drama Pakistan has staged 
there. 
  There will be one major benefit from it. The shroud of 
secrecy over the valley will be lifted and Pakistan's lies will 
be exposed. After all, this problem should be resolved by 
working together. The Indian prime minister has adopted the 
right attitude about it with a lot of thought, balance, and 
creativity behind it. Now the idea of just holding talks with 
Islamabad has been dropped. No doubt New Delhi wants to 
normalize and improve its relations with its neighbors, however, 
there must be an appropriate environment for that. The issues on 
which we have serious differences can be left for a later date. 
This is the right attitude and will serve the interests of both 
nations. Narasimha Rao himself had shed light on it. The time 
has come now for the international community to stop looking for 
faults, and try to find truth.*

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Unity in Militancy"] </F>
  [Text] An important development in the handling of foreign 
policy has practically gone unnoticed -- at least has not been 
commented upon as much as it deserved. 
  This is the induction of the leader of the opposition in 
Parliament as the head of the Indian delegation to the current 
session of the United Nations human rights commission in Geneva. 
Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee spoke at the Geneva meeting not as a 
partisan leader but as the accredited representative of the 
government and the public of this country. 
  It signifies there is a remarkable unity within the country 
on the Kashmir issue as it stands today. But more important is 
the Indian reaction to the exploitation of the Kashmir issue in 
the strategic game of the big power. On the face of it, this 
unity in approach is a Christmas gift from Mr. Bill Clinton and 
his administration. Mr. John Mallot, Ms. Robin Raphel and Mr. 
Clinton have spoken so volubly on Kashmir that even the most 
obsequious among Washington's friends in India find it difficult 
to accept the Clinton administration's attitude to India on the 
Kashmir issue. 
  Criticism has not been confined to charges of human rights 
violation by India's security forces in the Kashmir valley. The 
U.S. administration has called into question the accession of 
Jammu and Kashmir to India and tried to brand it as a civil war 
on the lines of Afghanistan. 
  No criticism has been levelled against Pakistan's support, 
both material and political, to the militants in the valley 
demanding secession from the Indian Union. It is this blatant 
abetment of armed secessionism that has now made New Delhi aware 
of the basics of U.S. policy and helped to bring about a degree 
of unity within the country. 
  The assumption on which New Delhi was working until last 
year 
was that after the Cold War, there would be a realisation on the 
part of Washington on the need to accept India as the more 
durable and reliable entity in south Asia. 
  It was also assumed Pakistan's geostrategic importance in 
the 
region had gone down with the disappearance of the Soviet Union. 
  For one thing, the huge, complex democracy that India 
happens 
to be is too difficult to manage and manipulate for any power 
however formidable it may claim to be. Even the opening up of 
the economy by the Indian authorities at the specific behest of 
the International Monetary Fund-World Bank bosses sitting in 
Washington does not provide that insurance for the policy makers 
in the state department and the Pentagon. 
  Second, Pakistan's importance to the Pentagon has been 
reinforced by the emergence of a whole cluster of central Asian 
republics rich in mineral wealth. Also the two sensitive zones 
of the Chinese strategic defence, namely, Tibet and Sinkiang are 
contiguous to Pakistan and Kashmir as well. 
  As the entire drama of resumption of an elected regime 
unfolded in Pakistan, it was clear the authority of the military 
junta has not really been liquidated. It has assumed a fresh 
significance in a changed context. 
  It is in this context one felt the repeated implorings by 
New 
Delhi with Washington to declare Pakistan a terrorist state was 
both unreal and pathetic -- rather demeaning to the self-respect 
of the country. 
  It is good to notice the Indian representative rebuffed the 
offer of third party mediation in Kashmir by the Organisation of 
Islamic Countries [OIC]. The OIC has long declared its support 
for the secessionists in the Kashmir valley. 
  The key to the settlement of the Kashmir crisis lies in the 
hands of the government and leaders of political parties. They 
have to take the initiative in talking to the militant groups 
and their fellow travellers in the Kashmir valley. They should 
arrange a round table in which all the concerned parties -- 
including most certainly the representatives of the Pandits who 
constitute a significant entity in the Kashmir valley -- are 
invited. 
  Incidentally, it was a welcome move on the part of the 
Pandit 
community to place its case before the Geneva meeting. This move 
makes it abundantly clear the alleged violations of human rights 
in the Kashmir valley do not go along the Hindu-Muslim communal 
divide. 
  For long, the Indian stand has been that Kashmir is an 
internal matter for India. The reality has been this is true in 
parts. The international aspect of the Kashmir question is 
related to India having taken the Pakistani armed attack on 
Kashmir on the very morrow of independence to the UN. 
  No doubt this aspect of the question has to be tackled at 
the 
international level and cannot be wished away. 
  If the burden of New Delhi's case is that all the trouble in 
Kashmir is due to Pakistan encouraging the militants, then it 
will be giving in to Islamabad's strident clamour for 
internationalising the Kashmir question. It is therefore all the 
more imperative the Indian leadership takes a bold initiative to 
open dialogue with the militants, treating them as fellow 
citizens however embittered they may be. 
  It is time the statesmanship displayed by the prime minister 
in unifying Indian opinion for a common stand on Pakistan's 
diplomatic offensive on Kashmir was projected at home. This way 
a common approach towards the Kashmiri people, however 
intractable the militants among them might be at the moment, can 
be forged.

<F P=106> [Article by Bharat Bhushan: "Divergent Discourses"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Several recent U.S. actions have created an 
impression bat not only is America not keen on improving 
relations with India, but that it seeks to play a partisan role 
on sensitive issues such as Kashmir. Levels of mutual suspicion 
are high, stray foreign policy pronouncements are magnified and 
the arena of diplomatic discourse appear to be shrinking. 
  Missives from the White House and an apparent softness 
towards state sponsorship of terrorism by Pakistan make it 
difficult to take Washington's claim of being even-handed in 
South Asia at face value. There are other indications, although 
by no means definitive as yet, that the U.S. may be getting into 
a special relationship with Pakistan. 
  It is not known what kind of sop was offered to Pakistan 
when 
the U.S persuaded it to withdraw the resolution on Kashmir in 
the UN General Assembly last year. If it was the withdrawal of 
the Pressler Amendment, as some observers believe, then clearly 
the U.S. has not been able to deliver. It remains to be seen 
where the US stands on Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir at the 
meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights at Geneva later 
this month. 
  Pakistan seems adamant on moving the resolution to embarrass 
India. But it could be embarrassing for the U.S. also, if it 
were forced to abstain from voting on an issue apparently 
concerning human rights. If the U.S. persuades Pakistan to 
desist once again, then it will not be without Pakistan 
extracting a price. If, however, the U.S. votes with Pakistan, 
it can kiss goodbye to any hope of improving ties with India. 
  For the time being, it appears that Indo-U.S. relations are 
being impelled by the momentum of daily reactions and 
counter-reactions to stray signals from Washington. While the 
Indian establishment seems to have been hijacked by media 
reaction, the Americans have become prisoners of their own 
verbiage on human rights. 
  It is unrealistic to expect that a Democratic administration 
would give up its public stance on human rights in Kashmir 
especially when abuses continue to occur. But there are severe 
problems with the way this administration views Kashmir and its 
attempts at engaging India on human rights issues to the 
exclusion of other aspects of Indo-U.S. relations. 
  For a start, arms of the U.S. foreign policy establishment 
are yet to understand the difference between annexation and 
accession when it comes to Kashmir, e.g. the U.S. Central 
Command Chief General Joseph P. Hoar's comments on how India 
"annexed" Kashmir in 1947. The Americans talk breathlessly about 
taking the, opinion of the "Kashmiri people" into account. But 
Pakistan has changed the demographic profile of the area 
occupied by it since 1947 to such an extent, that donkeys would 
decide about the future of horses if there were anything akin to 
a plebiscite. 
  The U.S. also does not understand the consequences for the 
rest of India if Kashmir were to become independent. Given the 
existence of a large and scattered Muslim population, there 
could be a thousand Bosnias in India itself. Happenings in 
Europe and Central Asia should be warning enough against a blind 
faith in self-determination for nationalities. 
  Kashmir and nuclear proliferation are no doubt important 
issues and must engage the attention of India. But day-to-day 
provocations have meant that the U.S. is either deliberately or 
by default letting Pakistan set the agenda for Indo-U.S. 
relations. On its part, lndia has also failed to project its 
foreign policy agenda in the U.S. beyond these issues. This 
either shows a lack of understanding of Washington or an 
inability to orchestrate its various arms. 
  The U.S. foreign policy establishment is not a monolithic 
self-conscious entity. U.S. foreign policy is formed through a 
multiplicity of discourses. The range cannot be covered 
adequately by the blanket term "American point of view". The 
State Department, Commerce Department, Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative, Pentagon, White House and Congress all have a 
say in foreign policy formulation. In addition, U.S. foreign 
policy is also influenced by powerful business lobbies, 
think-tanks and special interest groups including NGOs 
[Nongovernmental Organizations]. [passage ommitted] 
  India is not very high in the priority list of the U.S. It 
hardly receives any aid and private investment is not coming to 
India out of charity. Nor is there any prospect of GIs landing 
in Kashmir at any future date. Indian diplomacy, inasmuch as 
there is a need to carry on an economic and political 
relationship, can attempt to work around the drum-beaters of 
Clinton's global agenda instead of hoping for a good chit from 
the U.S. like an eager schoolboy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by S.C. Bhatt] </F>
  [Text] So long, the security forces have borne the brunt 
of the low-cost proxy war that Pakistan has been waging in 
Kashmir. They have shown exemplary patience and restraint in 
dealing with criminal elements trained, armed, and funded by 
Pakistan. Unfair and false accusations have been flung at them. 
The tragedy overall was that some elements in our own country 
were oblivious of the tremendous burden on the security men and 
were willing to be taken in by the untruthful propaganda. Now 
the answer to Pakistan and its supporters has come from the 
august Parliament of India. 
  Both houses have adopted with unanimity a resolution warning 
Pakistan against aiding and abetting the terrorists in Kashmir. 
The people's representatives have demonstrated that India 
stands completely united as one man on preserving her integrity. 
The Parliament has also shown that when the time comes 
democracy can prove stronger that the plutocracy that our 
neighbor seems to have and stronger than any other form of 
government. We may have our differences on many issues. 
Different parties have different views on how and when the 
political process in Kashmir should be restarted. Differences 
persist on who would be the best persons to run the state in the 
meanwhile. But on the integrity of the nation, on Kashmir being 
an inalienable part of India and the need to drive out the 
terrorists sent from across the border, there are no two 
opinions. 
  One wishes this warning to Pakistan had come somewhat 
earlier, but it has been satisfying to note that lately there 
has been the much desired clarity and firmness of resolve in the 
government's utterances and actions. The government seems to 
have grasped the meaning of the disturbing statements emanating 
from Washington which have given some strength to Pakistan's 
reckless actions in Kashmir. In a way, therefore, Parliament's 
resolution is a warning to both Islamabad and the United States. 
  By a fortuitous and fortunate coincidence, the European 
ambassadors who recently toured Kashmir also spoke through a 
representative on the issue of terrorism in Kashmir. Their 
evaluation is of importance because they had complete freedom to 
observe whatever they felt they should see to form an opinion. 
They have found evidence of the terrorists, including foreign 
mercenaries, operating in strength. They also saw that the 
people are fed up with the prolonged militancy supported by 
Pakistan. India has also to be vigilant against any excesses and 
ensure that the people in Kashmir are protected and not allowed 
to come to harm. The voice of the people of India expressed by 
Parliament must serve as a strong warning to both the 
perpetrator of the armed intrusions and its long distanced 
supporter.

<F P=106> [Article by Pranay Sharma: "BJP Bails Out Government on </F>
Jammu-Kashmir Resolution"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 22--The Centre today sought the 
BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party] help in getting the all-party 
resolution on Kashmir passed in Parliament unanimously. 
  Sensing the National Front-Left combine's resolve not to 
support the resolution unless the United States was named in it, 
the ruling party sought the BJP's help in convincing 
recalcitrant parties to give up their demand. 
  It was also agreed that since most parties had differed on 
how the Kashmir tangle should be handled, the proposed debate on 
the strife-torn state will be held later. 
  The strongly-worded resolution, passed by both Houses of 
Parliament this afternoon, focused its attack mainly on 
Pakistan. Though there are oblique references to the Clinton 
Administration for its support to Pakistan, it has not been 
named. The resolution says: "Any attempt from any quarter to 
interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met 
resolutely." 
  Sources said after yesterday's abortive attempt to convince 
the NF-Left combine not to insist on naming the United States in 
the resolution, the Speaker convened another meeting this 
morning in his Parliament chamber. 
  The leader of the Opposition and senior BJP member, Mr. Atal 
Behari Vajpayee, along with Left party leaders, Mr. Indrajit 
Gupta, Mr. Chitta Basu and Mr. Saifuddin Chowdhury, were present 
at the meeting. The Union home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, and 
the parliamentary affairs minister, Mr. V.C. Shukla, were 
representing the government. 
  Both Mr. Chavan and Mr. Shukla made it clear to Opposition 
leaders that the government was in no position to name the 
United States in the resolution. But Left party leaders stuck to 
their stand and argued that the Clinton government had been 
encouraging Pakistan by questioning not only India's human 
rights records in Kashmir but also its territorial integrity. 
Hence, without naming the United States, the resolution on 
Kashmir would be meaningless. 
  But Mr. Vajpayee convinced the dissenting parties to agree 
to 
what the government was saying and not to question the wording 
of the resolution since its main objective was to convey a clear 
message to the world that Indian political parties, despite 
their differences, were firmly behind the government when its 
territorial integrity was at stake. 
  He insisted that the main thrust of the resolution was to 
isolate Pakistan. "Instead of doing that should we waste time 
arguing whether the United States should also be named in the 
resolution?" He warned if Parliament failed to get the 
resolution passed unanimously it would only help Pakistan's 
gameplan and prove that even on such a vital issue, the Indian 
people were divided. 
  This did the trick and Left leaders gave up their obstinate 
stand and decided not to insist on naming the United States. Mr. 
Chitta Basu said: "The argument put forward by Mr. Vajpayee 
convinced us and we decided not to press for naming the United 
States. We too felt that it is more important to get the 
resolution passed unanimously than exposing our differences." 
  Despite the Left's decision to go along with the resolution, 
the CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist] general secretary, 
Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in a statement hit out at the 
government for failing to mention the United States in its 
Kashmir resolution. The statement said: "The resolution has 
failed to nail down the Clinton Administration which, under the 
guise of protecting human rights, is encouraging such activities 
for establishing its hegemony." 
  Later, all members of Parliament, cut across the party lines 
in decrying Pakistan's continued support of terrorism in 
Kashmir. The resolution, moved in the Lok Sabha by the Speaker, 
Mr. Shivraj Patil, and in the Rajya Sabha by the Chairman, Mr. 
K.R. Narayanan, firmly said India had the capacity to counter 
all designs against its unity and integrity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ground Rules of Encounter"] </F>
  [Text] To suggest that the historic show of unanimity in 
Parliament on Tuesday over Kashmir is a clear demonstration of 
national resolve would be tantamount to stating the obvious. In 
effect, the resolution achieves much more. The categorical 
affirmation that Jammu and Kashmir [J&amp;K] "has been, is and 
shall 
be an integral part of India" and that "all attempts to 
interfere in the internal affairs of India will be met 
resolutely" establishes the bottom line of the country's 
position on the subject. After this resolution, it is beyond the 
scope of any government, present or future, to flirt with 
outrageous proposals aimed at eroding national sovereignty in 
J&amp;K. It puts paid to both sinister and well-meaning 
"self-determination" projects and imposes a parliamentary veto 
on all attempts to redraw the map of India. Equally, it signals 
to separatists throughout the country that the territorial 
frontiers of India are non-negotiable and that demands for 
"autonomy" have to be articulated keeping this position in mind. 
Regardless of other internal arrangements, the national 
tricolour must fly from Kashmir to Kanyakumari . 
  Although the timing of the resolution was dictated by 
extraneous considerations, notably Pakistan's spirited bid to 
complete the "unfinished agenda" of partition and Washington's 
helping hand to Islamic terrorism, the resolution is calculated 
to have a salutary effect on the country's own morale. For the 
defence personnel engaged in the difficult and, sometimes, 
thankless job of fighting the insurgents, the resolution is 
reassurance that some cynical politicians will not barter away 
their sacrifices. For the dispossessed citizens of the Kashmir 
valley -- both Hindu and Muslim languishing forgotten in refugee 
camps there is at least a glimmer of hope that the will return 
to their homes one day. And ordinary citizens can delight in the 
realisation that no responsible person -- at least not yet -- 
can hope to remain in public life without acknowledging the 
emotive strength of Indian nationalism. Tuesday's resolution has 
established the parameter of national debate and international 
opinion will, in time, pay due heed to it. The collective echo 
of some 880 million cannot, after all, be treated as a casual 
refrain 
  There will, of course, be the dissenting voices and these 
are 
likely to be highlighted by the pathological India-haters, not 
least in international fora. But after this show of national 
solidarity, the private agendas of "Track-II" diplomacy will no 
longer be able to masquerade as representative Indian opinion. 
The capitulationists should be certainly listened to, but with 
the same degree of seriousness reserved for the lunatic fringe 
in democracies. Parliament has clearly set out the ground rules 
for coping with this ferocious assault on Indian nationhood; the 
onus is now on the Government to ensure it is translated into 
practice. The nation has shown the will and the Government must 
evolve a way.

  [Text] Bombay--In protest against human rights violations 
"Panun Kashmir," an organization to protect the interests of 
Kashmir Pandits, organized a street play, "Sab Theek Thak Hai" 
(everything is alright). 
  The play, which coincided with the human rights week 
observed 
all over the country and abroad by "Panun Kashmir" (our own 
Kashmir), is a satire depicting the ongoing terrorism in the 
Valley and the government's lackadaisical attitude toward the 
issue. 
  Various representatives of the organization have told the 
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva that New Delhi 
has "violated their rights, choosing instead to appease Islamic 
fundamentalist forces" in their state, resulting in the "growth 
of secular and democratic forces." 
  "For the first time we have exposed the designs of our state 
and the government's apathy. We have attacked both Farooq 
Abdullah and Congress Party. Our artistes will project the 
facts," said the organization convenor Agnishekhar. 
  "Our nation is on the verge of disintegration and Kashmir is 
the litmus test. If we lose Kashmir then it will be difficult 
for us to stay united," he added. 
  Disillusioned with the Bharatiya Janata Party's role, 
Agnishekhar said that even they reduced the Kashmir issue to a 
"mere simple argument." 
  Agnishekhar said more than 5,000 members of the community 
have died in camps and elsewhere due to sunstrokes, gastro 
entritis, typhoid epidemics, snake bites, etc., following their 
forced exodus from the Valley. 
  According to the organization, about 300,000 Kashmir 
Pandits, 
constituting 99 percent of the total population of Hindus living 
in Muslim majority areas of the Valley were forcibly pushed out 
by the terrorists, who were trained in Pakistan since 1989. 
"There is a threat of extinction. Death rate is increasing, 
while the birth rate has fallen drastically in Kashmir," said 
Agnishekhar. 
  Elaborating upon the destruction in Jammu and Kashmir, the 
organization members said about 1,100 Kashmir Pandits were 
tortured and killed by the terrorists; 105 educational 
institutions were damaged or forcibly occupied; 103 religious 
and cultural institutions were destroyed; 14,430 business houses 
were destabilized and 95 percent of the houses were looted.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Jammu's Explosion"] </F>
  [Text] The explosions that occurred in Jammu cannot be 
dismissed as simple incidents of terrorism. Government spokesmen 
and political leaders became silent after calling these blasts 
cowardly acts and announcing financial relief to those who were 
killed or wounded. The police will go through the formality of 
announcing an additional increase in security. Yet this has 
happened again and again. Governor General Krishna Rao has 
appealed to the people not to be deceived by the terrorists, who 
want only to increase communal tensions. Does the governor hope 
that when there are bomb blasts in a busy market that remind 
them of the blasts in Bombay, when people are killed or hurt and 
there is great bedlam in the market, that people will not get 
angry and demonstrate against the government and the police? If 
this was the case, then we would suspect that the apathy of the 
people in Jammu had reached its extreme, and that even the most 
serious incident cannot affect them. The Kashmir government 
should be thankful to the people that it was the police on which 
the angry youths focused their outrage and not on a specific 
group. But it is also important to understand that if more of 
these incidents occurred, it would be very difficult to remain 
calm. Therefore, the Jammu-Kashmir government should correct the 
problems in its police administration. The armed terrorist 
organizations in the Kashmir valley have gotten the support of 
the people in special circumstances. They have succeeded in 
establishing a reign of terror in the valley. If they succeed in 
doing the same thing in Jammu, though, it would be very 
difficult to fight the resulting anarchy. The entire 
administrative machinery of Jammu-Kashmir is ineffective, 
because the government is unable to get proper information about 
anti-national and terrorist activities. Therefore, after every 
incident, they make statements in a hurry, they seem to have no 
other alternative. 
  It is surprising because the government knew that due to the 
powerful campaign by Pakistan, there would be increased 
terrorist activity. Because of the increased security in the 
valley and in Doda, it was natural for the terrorists to attack 
the softer, easier targets in Jammu. Pakistan wants to show that 
the control of the Indian government in Jammu-Kashmir has ended, 
and that the whole state has rebelled. The Pakistan supporters 
argued in Geneva that it is not the Pakistani terrorists, but 
the local people in Kashmir, that are fighting the war for 
independence. The Jammu bomb blasts, therefore, should be seen 
in this context. All members of Parliament have declared 
Jammu-Kashmir an integral part of India and have repeated their 
determination to free the part of Kashmir currently under 
Pakistan's control. The central home minister is planning to 
accelerate economic development processes in Kashmir. However, 
all these promises will be on paper until they are implemented 
and an honest, effective police and administration are 
established in the state. The fact is that the Kashmir problem 
was created by poor government administration. Therefore, if the 
Indian government wants to give a proper and effective response 
to Pakistan's anti-India tirade, then it should dispose of the 
other political biases and start overhauling the administration 
in Jammu-Kashmir. The political party will benefit from this 
strategy because, in the present situation, no politics can be 
practiced there. The national determination expressed in 
Parliament should also be applied to the formation of an 
effective national strategy.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "Why Is the Hindu Suffering Not Noticed?"] </F>
  [Text] Bombay, 24 February (NP) -- It is surprising that 
truth-loving truth President Clinton has compared the Kashmir 
situation with Bosnia. According to him, the human rights of 
Muslims are being violated in Kashmir. His advisors are 
apparently giving him inaccurate reports. The fact is that 
Pakistani terrorists are destroying democracy in Kashmir and are 
committing horrible atrocities against Hindus to establish an 
Islamic feudal government. Even Hitler did not commit such 
atrocities against the Jews. The truth is that Hindus are being 
totally obliterated in Kashmir. 
  When the terrorists take hold of an Indian soldier, they 
take 
out his eyes, amputate his hands, feet, nose, and ears, and 
leave him to die. Some Indian soldiers acted in retaliation. If 
such atrocities were committed against U. S. soldiers, would the 
U.S. President remain quiet in the name of human rights? 
  Mr. Clinton should help the world's largest democracy and 
peace-loving country, India, stop terrorism instead of helping a 
country that is increasing terrorism and the drug trade all over 
the world. 
  It is important to let Mr. Clinton know that after 
independence, India appointed a Muslim president, governors, and 
chief ministers. Pakistan and Bangladesh, however, have not even 
given Hindus the right to vote. They are not even permitted to 
worship. Their democratic and human rights are being violated. 
In India, we grant special privileges to Muslims, which the 
Hindus here do not have. We have passed minority protection 
laws. In order to help Muslims get education and employment, the 
government is sending millions of rupees. The Shankaracharya of 
Shringeri said in an interview that it is the blood of Hindus 
that runs in the veins of Muslims. The Indian Government spent 
about 750 billion rupees on the Kashmiri people over the last 45 
years. Because of the hundreds of privileges, the population of 
Muslims in India has increased from 30 million to 120 million 
since independence. In Pakistan, however, because of the 
atrocious rule there, the number of Hindus has fallen from 10 
million to only 1 million. Hindus are also disappearing from 
Kashmir and Bangladesh. Such genocide has never happened 
anywhere else in the world. The Hindu society, because of its 
love for peace and tolerance, has suffered atrocities for 
thousands of years. 
  In this context, we are appealing to the president of the 
most powerful country in the world to take the initiative of 
protecting India, which has done so much work to increase peace 
and spirituality in the world. 
  Former U. S. Presidents Kennedy and Carter understood this 
very well. In order to stop terrorism in Kashmir, the whole 
world will have to speak out against it. Therefore, we are 
requesting that the Pope and Mother Teresa speak against it, so 
that truth and non-violence will win.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "The Center has Lost its Credibility by </F>
Changing Positions on the Kashmir Issue in International Forums"] 
  [Text] Bombay, 24 February (NP)--Panun Kashmir, the 
organization of Kashmiri pandits, says that the government of 
India, in changing its stand on the Kashmir issue repeatedly, 
has lost credibility at the international level. The position of 
our government has been weakened ethically. 
  Dr. Ajay Charungoo, spokesman for Panun Kashmir, told 
reporters today that the government is beginning to blame 
Islamic fundamentalism for the Kashmir problem. Before, the 
government blamed Pakistan's internal policy and drug smugglers 
for the problem. 
  Dr. Chrungoo returned on Monday after taking part in the 
human rights meeting in Geneva. In addition, Mr. Moti Kaul, 
president of the Kashmiri Pandit Association's Bombay branch, 
and Dr. Vijay Sazawal, president of the Indo-U. S. Kashmir 
Forum, participated as representatives of Panun Kashmir at the 
conference. 
  The Panun Kashmir spokesman said that the Indian government 
accused Pakistan of spreading unrest all over the country. It 
claimed to have proof of this. Why does not it sever diplomatic 
relations with such a country? The organization said that there 
is no sense in asking the United States to declare Pakistan a 
terrorist nation. According to the spokesman, this task should 
be done by the government of India. 
  Dr. Ajay Chrungoo said that the government had not explained 
the Kashmiri pandits' situation to other countries; that is why 
Western nations have learned only of Pakistan's side. He said he 
was doing the government's job. According to him, the government 
is giving too much importance to Asia Watch and Amnesty 
International. There are other human rights organizations; 
however, the government does not invite them. 
  Panun Kashmir has blamed all parties, including the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party], for the Kashmir problem. The spokesman 
said that the BJP should handle the Kashmir problem by rising 
above Article 370. He said that leaders like Vajpayee and 
Jaswant Singh are sitting on the same platform with the National 
Conference leaders, while the stand of the conference is clear. 
They want autonomy for Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kashmir: Islamic Consensus Not With </F>
Pakistan"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 24 February (NPT) -- Mr. Salman Khursheed, 
India's minister of external affairs, claims that the Islamic 
Conference countries understand India's stand on Kashmir, and 
that not all of its member nations are expected to vote in 
support of Pakistan. 
  Although Pakistan is trying to dye the Kashmir issue in 
Islamic colors, Mr. Khursheed was successful in getting the 
attention of the secretary general of the Conference by pointing 
out that after Indonesia, India has the largest Muslim 
population in the world, and that the votes of the Conference 
members in support of this resolution will affect the Indian 
Muslims. 
  India is discussing three concerns with members of the Human 
Rights Commission. One is that this controversial resolution 
will increase terrorism in Kashmir and would curb the progress 
of human rights protection efforts. The second is that voting in 
support or remaining absent during the vote will affect 
bilateral relations. Third, support of this resolution will 
directly affect India-Pakistan relations. 
  Mr. Khursheed met with representatives of several countries 
over the last three days and said that not participating in 
voting would be against the basic principles of human rights and 
would increase Pakistan's role in terrorism. 
  He said that the proposed resolution is being viewed in the 
framework of human rights in different parts of the world. 
  Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the opposition leader in the Lok 
Sabha who had also gone to take part in the conference, has 
insisted that member nations not be absent during the Pakistan 
resolution vote. He said that all nations friendly to India 
should vote against the resolution. 
  He told newsmen that the question was not one of human 
rights 
violations in Kashmir, but of Pakistan's support for terrorism 
in Kashmir, and that every country should oppose this.

  [Text] London--Britain has become an important center for 
political lobbying as well as fund-raising for an anti-India 
campaign on Kashmir, even though earlier acts of terrorism, 
aimed against Indian targets here, have not been repeated in 
recent years. 
  The British Muslim youth is being radicalized by several 
organizations whose agenda includes a Jehad against disbelievers 
in many countries. They receive funds from abroad and, in 
Britain, seek to capture the control and management of mosques. 
Western counter-terrorism experts say that the past five years 
have seen an explosion in the number of Muslim charities, not 
dedicated to purely humanitarian aims. 
  The Kashmir connection of two of these organizations has 
been 
disclosed in a report in THE GUARDIAN entitled, "The Young 
Muslims" and "Islamic Foundation" headed by Prof Kurshid Ahmed, 
known in Pakistan as the vice-president of Jamaat Islami, which 
has connections with extremists parties in Afghanistan and 
Kashmir. 
  The Islamic Foundation gave nearly 90,000 pounds sterling to 
a fund for Kashmir, according to the last published accounts in 
1990. Details of the expenditure were not given. Britain now has 
a law to curb the flow of charity money for terrorist activities 
abroad but its enforcement is not that easy. Jammat activists 
were said to be behind the original burning of Salman Rushdie's 
book in Bradford. 
  At the political level, some British politicians take an 
unusual interest in the Kashmir problem even though currently 
they are all critical of the meddling by American politicians on 
the issue of Northern Ireland. These MPs [members of Parliament] 
are not even of Kashmiri origin but are guided by the 
anti-Indian lobbies active in their constituencies. 
  Recently, both the Indian community as well as the Indian 
high commission intensified their efforts to present India's 
case on Kashmir with some notable results reflected in the last 
debate on the issue in the House of Lords. The Pakistani lobby 
has been able to enlist the services of a couple of academics 
also. At one time, very little reference material was circulated 
by the Indian side on the Kashmir issue among the political and 
media circles. The high commission has now circulated a series 
of backgrounders and brought out a compilation of articles on 
Kashmir in a book form. 
  The task of the Indian lobby is growing while it is not 
certain whether the British government will extend the same 
cooperation to India in checking Kashmiri extremism as it did in 
the case of Sikh extremism in Britain. The attempts to mobilize 
British Muslims for holy wars in foreign lands are a wider issue 
because these also take the form of anti-semistic propaganda and 
an assault on multi-culturalism. The new fervor has a distinct 
West-Asian flavor. The active groups are funded from outside 
Britain. 
  It is the point about outside funding that has become an 
additional irritant in the current controversy over the plans to 
establish a Hindu temple in Southall. The dispute involving the 
local council has divided the Asian community in the area on a 
religious basis. The controversy on buying a disused townhall 
continues to rage and the extent of bitterness about a 
provocative advertisement in a Pakistani newspaper here was 
revealed in a long phone-in program run by an ethnic radio 
station. 
  That a mosque can become a center of political program has 
been highlighted by THE GUARDIAN report which says that some of 
the literature being distributed by Islamic groups openly 
outside mosques incites violence against disbelievers. The 
radical groups argue against integration, saying that British 
Muslims are part not of British society but of the Islamic Ummah 
or world community. The Commission for Racial Equality has 
warned that the radical groups are planting a time-bomb under 
harmony between Muslims and British society.

<F P=106> [Article by M.J. Akbar: "Histrionic About History"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This country now has to deal 
with the United States' good intentions these days. There is a 
new mantra wafting out from Washington. Get everyone onto a 
table and talk, talk, talk. Or as they used to put it in old 
fashioned Americanese, it is better to jaw than to war. 
  The big success story of this mantra of course is the west 
Asia peace process, the entente between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation. If you can make a Jew and a Palestinian 
talk, you can open up a dialogue between God and Lucifer without 
problem. 
  Therefore the U.S. president, Mr. Bill Clinton, and his 
Oxford friend and present U.S. assistant secretary of state for 
south Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, have decided that the time has 
come to make India and Pakistan talk to Kashmiris about Kashmir 
and to each other about this and other topics. 
  If only this wide world, full of all sorts of different 
characters, was so amenable to one plastic code. Sadly this is 
not so. Kashmir and Palestine are not in the same place. You 
cannot even will them to be the same. Palestine now remains in 
the last, if most tortured, item on an agenda which has 
gradually been edging towards a resolution after three major 
wars and one momentous peace--though the latter was only between 
Israel and Egypt. Any change in the status quo will 
be the beginning of problems rather than the end of them. 
  If there is a comparison, and it is not a too steady one at 
that, then it is with the former constituent republic of 
Yugoslavia, Bosnia. When a hundred Bosnias erupt all across 
India as Muslims pay the price for Mr. Clinton's theatrics, 
where will Ms. Raphel's concern for human rights get us? The 
problems of Kashmir cannot be separated from the events of 1947. 
Even more so the problems cannot be separated from the 
legitimacy of the rationale of the partition and all that went 
with it. 
  If the United States puts its weight behind the idea that 
Hindu and Muslim can never live together in the Indian 
sub-continent then we are staring at a tragedy of gruesome 
proportions. There is no force in the world large enough to 
control an India blazing with communal hatred. 
  Perhaps this is why Ms. Raphel is also seeking to change 
history when she suddenly begins to question the legality of 
Kashmir's accession to India. Such a policy is madness. Good 
intentions are a poor excuse for irresponsibility of this 
magnitude. A little more reading of the facts, a touch of larger 
vision, would certainly help Washington. Words these days mean 
lives. We should take neither lightly.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakravarty: "Kashmir Problem: External </F>
Interference and an Internal Initiative"] 
  [Text] There is a self-evident truth in our politics that 
whenever our independence or autonomy is endangered our whole 
nation stands up as one unit to a man. This happened in 1962 
when China had attacked us at our northern border. The same 
thing happened in 1965 when we went to war with Pakistan. This 
happened again in 1971 when we took action against the armed 
invasion of Pakistan in order to free Bangladesh. In 1971, the 
whole nation had united against the U.S. "gunboat diplomacy" 
used in support of the Pakistani army. It should be known that 
the U.S. battleship Enterprise was exercising in the Bay of 
Bengal. Its purpose was to scare the Indian people, however, it 
failed in doing so. The only thing it succeeded in was making 
every section of Indian population angry. 
  Our five decades experience has made it clear how the people 
of this country meet any outside challenge or policy to 
intimidate and exploit us. The people will not bow to this, but 
will protect the pride and autonomy of their country. 
  The latest expression of this unique response is the 
nationwide Indian reaction to the conspiracies hatched in 
Washington supported by the leaders of Pakistan. The truth is 
that Pakistani noises made over Kashmir would not have affected 
us unless everyone from President Clinton down to low-level U.S. 
officials had not openly encouraged it to spew poison against 
the Indian stand. The anger that was created by the United 
States is not limited to its accusation of human rights 
violations by Indian troops. It includes its challenge to the 
truth about Kashmir's joining India and putting a question mark 
on it. The fact is that President Clinton and his assistants 
have declared the Kashmir issue as serious as the problems 
created by the civil war in Afghanistan. The Clinton government 
is openly encouraging Pakistani military officers and armed 
terrorists to encourage insurgency against the Indian government. 
  However, its effect is totally opposite to what was 
expected. 
How did this happen? This has created a solidarity and unity 
within the framework of Indian politics as was not seen since 
1971. This national unity resulting from the foreign plot 
against India was demonstrated in the leadership of the 
government delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting 
in Geneva and the Kashmir-related resolution introduced in the 
Parliament. There could not be a better display of a united 
national stand against the detestable conspiracy to separate 
Kashmir from the Indian Union. 
  This conclusion shows us the actual elements of the American 
policy in this region. The government policy-makers appeared to 
be working under the belief that after the fall of the Soviet 
Union and the end of the Cold War, Washington would think it 
necessary to consider India as a more dependable and stable unit 
compared to Pakistan in South Asia. At the same time, it was 
hypothesized that the disintegration of the Soviet Union would 
reduce Pakistan's importance in the American strategy for this 
region, because the United States would not need Pakistan as a 
military base in the changed international situation. 
  However, the emergence of facts proved both these notions to 
be wrong. The first reason for this is that despite economic 
liberalization, India is refusing to become a U.S. tributary or 
a supporter nation. The United States cannot consider India as a 
safe bet as long as this continues. The second reason is that 
the importance of Pakistan has not diminished in the Pentagon. 
The main basis for this is the possibility of expanding trade 
with the Central Asian countries, nearness to Pakistan, Kashmir, 
Tibet, and Sikiang which can be used for annoying China. 
  Against this background, anyone can realize how useless the 
Indian government's request to the U.S. Government to declare 
Pakistan a terrorist nation is. In contrast, the India 
deputation's criticism of the terrorism introduced from across 
the border at the Geneva meeting was very appropriate. It is 
equally important for the Indian officials to foil any third 
party's efforts to mediate in Kashmir because the United States 
would be behind it. 
  Keeping external interference out of Kashmir is one thing 
and 
dealing with this issue seriously as an internal problem is 
another; these two cannot be mixed up. We have been right in 
telling the rest of the world that unrest and tension in Kashmir 
is our internal issue. However, we also have to keep the fact in 
mind that we cannot resolve this issue just by saying that the 
whole problem was created by Pakistan. If we are honest with 
ourselves then we should not hesitate in admitting that our 
wrong approach in resolving this issue and the mistake of mixing 
up the political aspects with administrative aspects have 
created a feeling of alienation in the hearts and minds of the 
people in the valley. The truth is that the superficial and 
cheap strategy being used in the valley is an embarrassing 
situation for the Indian democracy. We still have the time to 
admit that the real key to solving Kashmir's problem is in the 
hands of this nation's government and the political parties. In 
order to find a permanent solution to this problem, they should 
take the effective and serious initiative of starting talks with 
the terrorist groups and their supporters in the Huriat 
Conference.

<F P=106> [Article by Aabha Dixit: "Strategy on the Borderline"] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad is pulling out all stops in a bid to make 
international opinion question the legality of Kashmir's being 
part of India. In response a sense of urgency about resisting 
Pakistani designs appears to have cut across party lines in 
India. The unanimous resolution passed in both houses of 
Parliament condemning Islamabad's role in the valley takes 
India's Kashmir policy into high gear. The resolution provides 
bipartisan support for a stronger and more credible response by 
New Delhi to Islamabad's strategy of keeping up pressure in the 
international media. 
  Irrespective of the outcome of Islamabad's attempts to make 
the United Nations human rights sub-commission accept a 
resolution on Kashmir, New Delhi's political reactions will 
inevitably gain momentum. 
  But India's response requires an understanding of Pakistan's 
motives and tactics. As Sun Tzu, the Chinese military strategist 
wrote, "Know your enemy, know yourself, hundred battles, hundred 
victories." 
  With partition two mutually exclusive stereotypes have 
symbiotically grown together on either side of the border. 
Pakistan's ruling classes have fostered a feeling among their 
people that Indians are not reconciled to partition. That India 
would do anything to undo the deed and subject Muslims to Hindu 
rule. 
  The constant example given as proof is the case of Kashmir, 
a 
state in which a Muslim majority population is kept hostage for 
exploitation. In time Islamabad has been able to merge 
Pakistan's creation with the Kashmir problem. It has evolved 
into a general theoretical exposition that without Kashmir the 
concept of Pakistan remains incomplete. 
  In India the accession of Kashmir to the Union has been 
upheld as valid and final. Pakistan is seen as an eternal 
spoiler who will not rest till Kashmir has been wrenched from 
India, by force if necessary. 
  New Delhi has been highlighting Islamabad's attempts to 
quietly hide a disconcerting fact. Mohammad Ali Jinnah rejected 
outright the idea of a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir in 1947, 
a year before the first UN security council resolution. The 
memoirs of Louis Mountbatten have noted that when the viceroy 
suggested a plebiscite to Jinnah, the latter reacted by saying 
"it was redundant and undesirable to have a plebiscite when it 
was quite clear that states should go according to their 
majority population." 
  These two stereotype images have over time become 
self-evident truths. They have automated the reactions of the 
two neighbours to each others equally predictable actions. 
  New Delhi's perception has evolved as a result of its 
experience of handling Pakistan during the period 1947-71. 
Pakistan's military strategy was to launch a lightning offensive 
preceded by a relatively smaller infiltration period which they 
thought would be backed by the Muslim populace to decouple 
Kashmir from India. 
  After 1971 Islamabad's strategy underwent a subtle yet 
significant change. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto began using dual methods 
to deal with his enemies. On the one hand Bhutto acknowledged 
that India was the pre-eminent power in south Asia. On the other 
he began an improved version of the Kashmir strategy. He placed 
an emphasis on time and mass indoctrination inside Kashmir. 
  The main objective of Bhutto's policy was to disrupt, 
discredit and paralyse the Indian administration before 
committing Pakistani troops. He had by then realised mere 
sympathy for the cause did not have enough strength to win him 
Kashmir. What was required was a radicalisation of the 
population through religion. It is interesting that while Bhutto 
abhorred the role of the fundamentalist parties in domestic 
politics, he was not averse to seeking their support for his 
destabilising of Kashmir and Afghanistan. 
  In Kashmir, Bhutto used the organisational strength of 
fundamentalist parties with cross border affiliations to spread 
Islamic ideas as an antidote to the secular forces being 
projected by New Delhi. It began by focussing upon Islamic 
education. The Jamaat e Islami was useful because of its sway in 
the madrassas that rapidly spread throughout the rural areas of 
Kashmir valley. 
  The spread of Islamic ideals was the first element of the 
strategy of radicalising the Kashmiri Muslims. The second was 
the creation of an elaborate information ring within the 
Kashmiri government. The political crises of the period 1982 to 
1987 allowed pro-Pakistani fundamentalist parties to exploit the 
alienation of the common Kashmiri. 
  Through the maulvis Islamabad was able to 
communicate with the common Kashmiri for the first time. It set 
up a fledgling organisation within Kashmir for greater use in 
future. Ms. Bhutto's overthrow did not mean the end of the 
Kashmir gambit. Instead the policy was streamlined, and the 
military's direct involvement increased. 
  It also received more funding because of Zia-ul-Haq's 
Islamicisation policies. The principle beneficiaries of the 
Islamic taxes zakat and ushr were the 
ulema. They in turn used it to consolidate their 
position on both sides of the border. Suddenly the maulvi became 
an economically important person, prepared to accept the radical 
programme that his handlers from Islamabad sold him. Most 
importantly, the policy of Islamicisation through education at 
the grassroots became an effective counter to the relatively 
successful philosophy propagated by New Delhi that Kashmiriyat 
was built on secularism. 
  New Delhi ignored the quiet revolution taking place inside 
Kashmir. It did not take advantage of the Afghan imbroglio to 
counter Islamabad's Kashmir operations. Instead New Delhi 
preferred to accept at face value the peace overtures made by 
the Zia regime in respect of Kashmir. 
  The greatest failure on the part of New Delhi was its 
inability to comprehend the changed Pakistani strategy and 
undertake counter measures. The prevalent thinking in New Delhi 
was that Islamabad would repeat its 1948 and 1965 strategies. 
  With Zia, the radicalisation of Kashmiri society proceeded 
at 
a feverish pace. The Inter-service Intelligence created a 
network of informers and sympathisers who penetrated every state 
government department. Infiltration and exfiltration routes were 
identified. Slowly weapons training along with ideological 
brainwashing began to be imparted in camps in Pakistan occupied 
Kashmir. By 1988 the trickle had become a flood. All that was 
required of Ms. Bhutto was to give the underground movement a 
green light with her azadi speech. 
  Between Ms. Bhutto's first and second terms, Islamabad was 
unable to push its Kashmir strategy because political stability 
returned to New Delhi. Further, militancy in the valley had come 
dangerously close to despondency as New Delhi remained 
unperturbed by terrorist attacks that included bombing police 
headquarters and numerous kidnappings. 
  Increased international attention had started bringing about 
a change in the perception of the human rights organisations. 
They began looking upon militant groups as violators. Amnesty 
International, the United States state department and Asia Watch 
began taking notice. Towards the end of the presidency of Mr. 
George Bush, the threat of being labelled a state sponsor of 
terrorism loomed large. 
  In a bid to wiggle out of this unhappy turn of events 
Islamabad began "privatising" the terror drive, bringing in 
fundamentalist parties as intermediaries to provide money, 
material and boost the morale of the militants. This transition 
was taking place at a time when a power struggle between the 
president and prime minister diverted Islamabad from the Kashmir 
effort. 
  In Ms. Bhutto's second term Islamabad's options had narrowed 
considerably. Militancy by itself was not capable of wrenching 
the state out of the Union. The militants were becoming 
demoralised. New recruits were becoming difficult to find. As a 
result, Islamabad had to relocate unemployed Afghan mercenaries 
into the valley in greater numbers to keep the pressure going. 
Continuation of the existing strategy allowed Mr. Sharif to get 
an upper hand in the domestic political tussle. 
  There was no other option for Ms. Bhutto other than to 
internationalise the dispute. She had to do something radically 
different to gain the high ground and boost the militants. In 
this effort she was fortunate to find unexpected help from Ms. 
Robin Raphel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state in charge of 
the newly created south Asia bureau. Ms. Raphel had sought to 
reopen old controversies by disputing the legality of the 
Instrument of Accession, equating civil war in Afghanistan with 
insurgency in Kashmir. 
  The strategy adopted by the Benazir government has been to 
get as much exposure for its new stance. It tries to highlight 
the human rights facet of the Kashmir issue. By pushing this 
angle, Islamabad has hoped to capitalise upon international 
concern for human rights. It was therefore logical she would 
pursue a multi-pronged strategy. 
  She sought the Organisation of Islamic Conference's help, on 
grounds that Muslims were being "martyred" in the valley. In the 
larger and non-religious fora, like the UN General Assembly and 
the human rights commission, she sought to place Islamabad's 
charges on a secular plane. By attempting to turn up 
international pressure through the passage of a resolution in 
Geneva next week, Islamabad hopes to justify the other element 
of its strategy--the accession of the state of Pakistan. 
  In the coming days Islamabad's strategy will be to continue 
keeping Kashmir in the international spotlight, create hysteria 
in the West so that it could emerge as the fount of a nuclear 
conflagration and seek to give the Kashmiri secessionists the 
legitimacy of a national liberation movement. 
  The task before the Indian polity is one of monumental 
proportions. A combined effort must be made to send out an 
equivocal message of the inherent strength and determination of 
the nation to rise to any occasion. This could deter the 
building up of further pressure. But the most suitable rebuff to 
Islamabad's campaign would be the initiation of a political 
dialogue in the valley.

  [Text] Bombay, March 2--Panun Kashmir, an organization of 
refugee Kashmiri Hindus, has criticized India's defence of the 
Kashmir issue at international forums, saying it was from "a 
very low level of moral credibility" as the country has been 
continuously changing its perception and projection of the 
problem. Demanding that India cut off diplomatic relations with 
Pakistan, the organization suggested that the Union Home 
Ministry entertain human rights bodies other than Amnesty 
International and Asia Watch which, they claim, are biased. 
  Following their return from the UN Human Rights Conference 
in 
Geneva, leaders of the organization addressed a press conference 
here today. The spokesman, Mr. Ajay Chungroo, claimed there was 
evidence to suggest that Pakistan and the ISI [Inter-Service 
Intelligence of Pakistan] were involved in terrorist activities 
in this country. Even the Home Ministry, he claimed, had 
admitted as much. 
  Mr. Chungroo had presented a paper--on behalf of the Indian 
Institute for Non-Aligned Studies--on the minority and refugee 
status of Kashmiri Hindus at the conference, the first time the 
issue had been discussed at this level. 
  Another member of the delegation, Mr. Moti Kaul, said the 
overall impression was that most delegates were ignorant of the 
real issues in Kashmir and he blamed the Indian Government for 
this. He claimed that Panun Kashmir was doing the job of the 
Government but added, "We are not stooges." 
  Mr. Kaul claimed that Pandits were victims of the 
Government's policy on Kashmir. "Even today, between 250,000 and 
300,000 Kashmiri Pandits forced to flee the State are living in 
sub-human conditions, refugees in their own homeland. And we 
thought it was time the international community was made aware 
of this," Mr. Kaul said. 
  While stating that they did not want to be "hostages of 
Indian secularism in Kashmir," Mr. Chungroo said that the 
fundamentalist-terrorist problem was spreading to Jammu. He 
criticized the Prime Minister for not visiting any of the 
refugee camps, not even those in New Delhi. "We are asking for 
our own territory, yes, but in such a way that we have greater 
integration with the country. We went to Geneva because we have 
India's interests at heart." 
  The members felt that India should not wait for the United 
States to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. The United States, 
they said, had its own agenda and sought "more direct 
involvement in the territorial problem for its own reasons." 
Criticizing the Government's inconsistent stand on Pakistan, Mr. 
Chungroo said: "It just can't go on. Instead of waiting for the 
United States we must demonstrate our firmness and cut off 
diplomatic ties." 
  Both Mr. Chungroo and Mr. Kaul were critical of the 
"excessive importance given by India to the Amnesty 
International and Asia Watch reports on human rights abuses. 
They questioned the reports that the abuses began in 1989 and 
pointed out that these organizations admitted that the scope of 
their investigations was limited. 
  Amnesty, they said, had stated that it examined human rights 
violations by the state, but they wondered who examined those 
committed by terrorists. "When we asked why they did not visit 
the refugee camps in Delhi even after they were provided the 
addresses last year, they said `No time,'" Mr. Chungroo said. 
  The organization expressed disappointment that the 
resolution 
adopted by Parliament recently did not mention the refugee 
problem of Kashmiri Pandits and blamed all political parties for 
their perception of and approach to the problem. "Even the BJP 
because it is unable to go beyond the Article 370 issue," Mr. 
Chungroo said. They were confident, however, that the Centre's 
attempts to encourage Dr Farooq Abdullah's participation would 
backfire as "he is one of those who advocates autonomy" for 
Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Poser To Washington"] </F>
  [Text] Putting on record the first strong criticism by an 
Indian Government leader of the Clinton administration's stand 
on Kashmir, Home Minister S.B. Chavan sought to mark a watershed 
in Indo-U.S. relations when he told the Lok Sabha on Wednesday 
[March 2] that New Delhi would have to find out what 
Washington's intentions are. Mr. Chavan chose his words 
carefully. When he said it was absolutely clear the U.S. was 
not interested in helping either Pakistan or India but its own 
self, the Home Minister was suggesting that U.S. objectives in 
Kashmir were neither the protection of human rights of Kashmiris 
nor the elimination of a decades-old feud between two South 
Asian neighbours. That raises the question how the U.S. seeks 
to further its own interests in Kashmir and what these interests 
are. Mr. Chavan's statement is unlikely to elicit more than a 
staid explanation from Washington that its objective is to 
ensure human rights in Kashmir and elimination of tension 
between Pakistan and India which has the potential of a nuclear 
conflagration. But such officialese will not help in lifting 
the cloud of misunderstanding that is creeping into Indo-U.S. 
relations. Mr. Chavan's statement should be read in the context 
of two others that Indian ambassador in Washington Siddhartha 
Shankar Ray made in recent weeks. The import of Mr. Ray's first 
pronouncement was that India is aware of the grey areas of 
America's human rights record and the nature of possible 
minority demands, but has refrained from mentioning them. The 
second statement was that the idea of holding a plebiscite in 
Kashmir is an absurdity. Together, these assertions mean, 
first, that none should pelt stones at others while sitting in a 
glass house and, secondly, that to be able to help common 
friends engaged in a feud, one must be aware of the ground 
realities to acquire the minimum credentials to be an honest 
broker. 
  The Clinton administration is astonishingly out of touch 
with 
the realities in South Asia. Unless Washington wants a 
strategic base in an independent Kashmir, it is difficult to see 
why it must persist in making statements at the level of Mr. 
Clinton and Ms. Raphel the only consequence of which can be 
boosting the sagging morale of the militants. Mr. Chavan has 
asked Washington to explain its stand on Kashmir because Ms. 
Raphel questions the validity of Kashmir's accession to India 
and claims that she is reflecting the administration's view. At 
the same time, the U.S. charge d'affaires in New Delhi asserts 
that Washington's stand is different from what she says. The 
American explanation needs to be unambiguous. Unless it is so, 
doubts will grow about a carefully executed programme of 
disinformation to confuse India opinion-makers (politicians, 
media and professionals) and thereby weaken the Government's 
resolve to withstand extraneous pressure over Kashmir or 
non-proliferation. If the U.S. can demand Indian transparency 
over human rights in Kashmir, New Delhi can use a matching right 
to ask the U.S. to be transparent about its intentions in 
Kashmir. It is not polemics but a necessity, especially because 
the U.S. sense of involvement in Kashmir shows no signs of 
waning although its role as an honest broker has carried it 
nowhere.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Darshan Singh, president, Small Newspapers </F>
Editors Guild] 
  [Text] Foreign mercenaries have added a new menacing twist 
to the situation in the Kashmir Valley by infiltrating in large 
numbers with modern weaponry. Security Forces Director General 
Mr. D.K. Arya, in a recent interview to a Bombay newspaper, said 
there are at least 3,000 foreign mercenaries active in Kashmir 
Valley. These mercenaries are mostly Afghans, Lebanese, 
Sudanese, and Egyptians. They have been showing an increasing 
presence in the valley and beyond in Doda and Kishtwar and most 
of the areas westward. In a recent meeting, the Indian 
ambassador to the United States, Mr. S.S. Ray, told the under 
secretary of state, Mr. Peter Tarnoff that foreign mercenaries 
promoted by external forces are deeply involved in Kashmir 
crisis which is one of the important causes for persistence of 
terrorist violence there. These terrorists are well entrenched 
and possess the most modern system of fire arms, ammunition, and 
wireless sets. They have equipment like the ones available with 
the organized defense forces only. The number of Halogen [as 
heard] 60-mm mortars, rocket launchers, rifles, grenades, sniper 
rifles, AK-47 rifles, and ammunition have been siezed from them 
in a series of raids conducted by the security forces in the 
past few months. 
  The infiltration of mercenaries began about a year ago 
mostly 
through Pak-occupied Kashmir. Pakistani soldiers provided them 
with cover under a heavy barrage of firing on the Line of 
Control as they sneaked into the Indian territory in small 
numbers. These mercenaries have excellent training as most of 
them fought against Russians and then against Hekmatyar in 
Afghanistan. When Afghan war against former Soviet Union ended, 
these Islamic militants simply moved to another front, that is, 
Kashmir. That is why they are very different from the earlier 
Kashmiri militants, who usually adopted hit-and-run tactics. 
  These mercenaries are being looked after by the 
Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan financially and 
also with constant supply of sophisticated weapons and gadgets. 
They are basically fugitives in their own country, persona non 
grata, and would therefore be tried or shot. Their only 
motivation for involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir 
comes from an icono of religion [as heard] suggesting suitable 
brainwashing by ISI which gives them an added zeal. These 
mercenaries are virtually leading the terrorist movement in the 
valley at present. The seeds of terrorism originating in Afghan 
conflict seems to have boiled over to this part of the world. 
Recent media coverages televised in USA and Canada offer 
compelling evidence in support of India's mounting concern over 
the spread of terrorist violence in South Asia, particularly in 
Kashmir valley. Activities of these trained terrorist hordes 
have also resulted in such tragic incidents as the bombing of an 
Air India airliner over the Atlantic ocean in 1985 and the 
attack of the World Trade Center in New York City last year. 
  Despite the continuing involvement of foreign mercenaries 
and 
persisting terrorist violence promoted by alien forces, India 
has not diluted its commitment to the restoration of the 
political process in Jammu and Kashmir. With this aim in view, 
the government is at present engaged in the onerous [as heard] 
task of bringing peace and normality in the valley. Attempts of 
militants to step up violence in the valley and cause 
large-scale law and order problem through destruction of Muslim 
shrines, including Hazratbal, have been frustrated in the recent 
past. 
  Besides infiltration of foreign mercenaries, narco-smuggling 
is also playing a damaging role in Kashmir. Pakistan's drug 
barons are engaged directly and indirectly in providing 
financial and other support to militants who utilize this money 
for procuring modern weaponry with a view to creating law and 
order problem in Jammu and Kashmir. Is this the drug and arms 
peddling nation that waxes eloquent on human rights at Geneva? 
[sentence as heard].

<F P=106> [Article by Kranti Kumar Sharma: "How Long Will the </F>
Displaced Kashmiris Be Neglected?"] 
  [Text] The Indian delegates attending the UN Human Rights 
Commission's 50th conference have declared Pakistan's failure to 
get support for its resolution on human rights violations in 
Kashmir as their great victory. However, the displaced Kashmiris 
have played a very important role in this success. They not only 
exposed the insincerity of Pakistan's worry about human rights, 
but also informed the international community of its wicked 
plans to spread terrorism. Will the government continue to be 
uninvolved in the pain of the hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris 
who are living like refugees in their own country? 
  Ajay Chrungoo, president of the Kashmiri Pandits 
organization, Panun Kashmir, appealed to the Human Rights 
Commission asking that before cultural disintegration and ethnic 
genocide happens, the international community should interfere 
and stop it. According to him more than 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits 
had to flee the valley to avoid terrorism. Pakistan has always 
tried to strengthen the fundamentalists in the valley to take 
over Kashmir. Now, the Kashmiri Pandits are living like refugees 
in a democratic and secular nation like India. The terrorist 
activities in Kashmir have transformed into efforts to get rid 
of the minority Hindus in the valley. This is the climax of the 
ethnic genocide of this peace-loving group. The purpose of the 
terrorists behind this violence is to annihilate all the 
non-Muslim groups in Kashmir and form a society based on the 
supremacy and control of one religion. The violent activities of 
the terrorists in Kashmir cannot be declared appropriate because 
of their political or so-called idealist values. The terrorism 
in Kashmir is not a war for independence in any sense. An 
independence effort that destroys other people's independence 
just is not appropriate. 
  The Indo-European Kashmir Forum also called a press 
conference to get international support for the Kashmiri Hindus. 
The president of this forum is Dr. Shakti Bhan Khanna, and 
includes Dr. K.N. Pandita, president of Panun Kashmir's women 
branch, and the leaders of the Daughters of Vitasta and Friends 
of Kashmir. These Kashmiri leaders said that the Kashmiri 
Pandits have been pushed into the margins because of Islamic 
fundamentalism and violence spread by the terrorists for the 
last five years. About 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to 
flee the valley because of murders, rapes, verbal abuse, 
humiliation of women, and physical tortures. About 100,000 
Pandits have been mercilessly murdered. They expressed regret 
that the international community, especially the human rights 
organizations and communication media, have not paid any 
attention to the prolonged tragedy of Kashmiri Pandits. The 
representatives of human rights organizations have not visited 
even once after 1990 to observe the Kashmiri Pandits who have 
directly suffered from Pakistani conspiracies. It is ironical 
that none of the organizations in the world that claim to 
protect human rights have taken this human tragedy seriously. 
According to Kashmiri leaders, they also met with the Amnesty 
International and other human rights organizations. However, 
Amnesty flatly said that it only deals with terrorism in which 
governments are involved. When Amnesty was told that the 
terrorism in Kashmir is spread by Pakistan, it did not pay any 
attention to it. 
  It is a result of Kashmir Pandits' activities that there is 
a 
possibility of Kashmir Pandits' problems being discussed in a 
sub-committee meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva 
this summer. Abraham Fall, assistant general secretary of the UN 
Human Rights Commission, told the leaders of Kashmiri refugees 
that the problem of Kashmiri Pandits is really serious and it is 
imperative that an acceptable solution of this problem is found. 
Some Kashmiri separatists had insisted to Abraham Fall to send a 
fact-finding commission to Kashmir. However, he had rejected 
this request saying that he did not want to form any 
presumptions on this issue. 
  The Kashmir Pandits are greatly perturbed by the Indian 
government's lack of interest. During the last week of December 
last year, they had organized the first Kashmiri Pandits 
Conference in Delhi. In this conference they declared Pakistan a 
terrorist nation and appealed to human rights organization, 
religious groups, and all the countries in the world to declare 
Pakistan a terrorist nation for encouraging terrorism in India. 
The "Delhi Declaration" was issued at the end of this 
conference. This declaration said that Kashmiri Pandits will 
increase their efforts to get Panun Kashmir back. It also had a 
map of Panun Kashmir which shows the region from Baramula in the 
northeast of the Vitasta River to Berinag as part of Panun 
Kashmir. The Delhi Declaration asked that Panun Kashmir be under 
the central government and that the Indian Constitution be fully 
implemented there. 
  The demand for a separate homeland by the Kashmiri Pandits 
may appear to be impractical but they have used this demand for 
outlining their needs for resettlement. The Kashmiri refugees 
are suffering from a double tragedy. The Pakistan-supported 
terrorism has forced them to leave their homes on the one side, 
and the government's neglect on the other side has made things 
even worse. The demand for a homeland will not solve the 
problem, however, we have to understand that the Kashmiri 
Pandits cannot be totally ousted from Kashmir. Kashmir belong to 
them as much as it does to those of other religions living 
there. It is the government's responsibility to create the 
opportunities for this peace-loving group displaced by the 
terrorists to return to the valley. However, the government does 
not seem to be serious at all about it. The Bharatiya Janata 
Party has demanded several times in the Parliament and in the 
streets for plans to resettle and return the Kashmiris to their 
home. However, the government did not pay any heed to it. Should 
not our government pay attention to the Kashmiri refugees after 
returning from Geneva?*

  [Text] New Delhi has made it clear that Pakistan's 
withdrawal of its resolution in Geneva is unconditional, and 
there is no question of linking it with sending a fact-finding 
mission to Kashmir. The foreign secretary, Mr. Srinivasan, told 
a crowded press conference in New Delhi today that India sought 
an early vote on the resolution as it was confident that it will 
be defeated. While reaffirming India's readiness to continue 
dialogue with Pakistan, he said there is no scope for Iran or 
any other country to mediate on the issue. He said Pakistan has 
failed in its third attempt to raise the issue in the 
international fora. Mr. Srinivasan hoped that Islamabad will 
now embark on a more constructive path of a bilateral dialogue 
to settle the issue with India. 
  The Congress(I) has congratulated the government for 
effectively thwarting the attempts of Pakistan at the UN Human 
Rights Commission at Geneva to internationalize the Kashmir 
issue. In a press release issued in New Delhi today, the party 
spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, described the developments as a 
diplomatic success for India as Pakistan found itself totally 
isolated in the international community. He said the clear 
message to Pakistan from Geneva is that it must go back to the 
Sshimla pact. 
  The All India Minorities Front has hailed the diplomatic 
victory achieved by the government on Kashmir. In a statement in 
New Delhi, the Front president, Mr. S.M. Arif, said the outcome 
of the Geneva meeting proved that the so-called human rights 
violations in Kashmir are mere propaganda by Pakistan to defame 
India. 
  The Communist Party of India has expressed the hope that 
good 
sense will prevail on the Pakistan Government now that it has 
withdrawn its resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights at 
Geneva. In a statement issued in New Delhi today, the National 
Executive of the party said that Pakistan should make an honest 
effort to solve it within the framework of the Shimla agreement.

to settle the issues with India. 
  On the Iranian ambassador's suggestion at Geneva for sending 
a group of ambassadors from Muslim countries to visit Kashmir, 
the foreign secretary said it cannot be termed as an 
international fact-finding mission. This facility is already 
available as no prior permission is needed for all New 
Delhi-based ambassadors except Pakistan and Libya. He pointed 
out that a team of 10 ambassadors had been to Jammu and Kashmir. 
They included four members of the Organization of Islamic 
Countries. Mr. Srinivasan also said that there is automatic 
deferment of the Pakistani resolution to the next session of the 
UN Human Rights Commission as once the resolution is withdrawn, 
it has to start the process anew. He said 15 countries 
specifically asked Pakistan to withdraw its resolution after a 
brief postponement of voting, and five of them wanted India and 
Pakistan to continue their bilateral dialogue. He said the 
Indian delegation had done a good job in Geneva. Replying to a 
question, he said the time is not yet ripe for permitting 
Amnesty International delegation to visit Kashmir as its report 
on the Bombay blast was biased. 
  All the major political parties have expressed happiness and 
satisfaction over the outcome of the Pakistani resolution in 
Geneva yesterday. The Congess(I) spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, 
described Islambad's withdrawal of the resolution as a 
diplomatic success for India. 
  The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. Murli Manohar 
Joshi, congratulating the Indian delegation, urged the 
government to take firm action to curb militancy in the valley. 
  The CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist] General 
Secretary, Mr. Harkishen Singh Surjeet, expressing satisfaction 
over yesterday's happenings in Geneva, has called upon the 
government to find a political solution to the Kashmir issue. 
  In a statement in New Delhi today, the National Executive of 
the CPI has asked Pakistan to refrain from internationalizing 
the Kashmir issue and make an honest effort to resolve it within 
the framework of the Shimla Agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Habibul Rehman: "Exclusion of Kashmiri Freedom </F>
Fighters] 
  [Text] Pakistan and India have agreed to include Kashmiris 
in talks and to continue sincere efforts to resolve the Kashmir 
issue. This agreement was expressed in the joint communique 
issued by the foreign secretaries of both countries in Islamabad 
on 3 January after the two-day talks. Mr. Shaheryar Khan, 
Pakistan's foreign ministry secretary, said that additional 
talks at any level will be hold only after the situation in 
occupied Kashmir improves and the practice of human rights 
violation is ended. Mr. J. N. Dixit, the Indian foreign 
secretary, referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto on 2 January in his briefing to the Indian news 
correspondents and hinted that he expected the prime ministers 
of India and Pakistan to meet in the near future. To pave way 
for the leaders' meeting, one or two divisions of the Indian 
army now in Kashmir will be transferred to another area. There 
is also the possibility of giving permission to the 
representatives of some international human rights agencies to 
visit Kashmir and stay in Srinagar. Prime Minister Narasimha Rao 
has decided to call a conference of the leaders of Indian 
political parties this month to see how far India should move 
towards conciliation when the Pakistani prime minister visits 
Delhi. The Indian prime minister will also discuss the proposal 
suggested by the United States, Europe, and Japan to put Kashmir 
under UN administration and establish a caretaker government 
under a UN appointed administrator with representatives from all 
Kashmiri groups in this proposed conference. 
  A Kashmiri leader who supports independence of Kashmir has 
returned after finishing his jail term in Belgium. He is busy 
assuring Pakistani leaders that the proposed independent Kashmir 
will have the same relationship with Pakistan as is between a 
younger and elder brother. Although it was Pakistan's prominent 
lawyer S.M. Zaffar who defended and won freedom for Amanullah 
Khan, chairman of Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), from 
the Belgian jail, the JKLF members believe that moral support 
from more than one Western nations played an important part in 
this release. The JKLF chairman appeared in Islamabad when the 
foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan were holding talks, 
and began to publicize his proposal of an independent Kashmir 
through his speeches and statements in the newspapers. Mr. 
Amanullah Khan said in an interview that Pakistan was not in a 
position to get all of Kashmir through diplomatic pressure or 
the use of strength. That is why the JKLF is demanding an 
independent Kashmir. The JKLF believes that the proposed 
independent Kashmir will always be a friend of Pakistan and it 
will have the same attitude as of a younger brother. The younger 
brother will want to have a defense pact with the elder brother 
and will assure that river water coming from Kashmir will always 
keep the great land of Pakistan green and fertile. Referring to 
historical records, the JKLF chairman recalled that when Quaid-e 
Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah had talked about the independence of 
states, he had presented the case of freeing former Hyderabad in 
the U.N. Security Council and had recognized the right of states 
to independence. Dr. Mehbub-ul Haq, a former finance minister in 
Pakistani government, is also in Islamabad after visiting the 
United States. He is advocating putting Kashmir under UN 
administration for the interim period. 
  When the announcement to hold talks with India at foreign 
secretaries level were made while the curfew was still imposed 
in Srinagar's Hazratbal shrine and human rights were still being 
violated rampantly in occupied Kashmir, the rationale was given 
that the consortium of the nation that was to issue aid and loan 
to Pakistan was meeting the following month and Pakistan's 
request would be considered with full sympathy. Despite any 
progress in the talks that concluded on 3 January in Islamabad, 
since our government has promised to continue this series of 
talks, it is expected that we will be rewarded and new loans 
worth two or two and one-half billion dollars will be approved. 
It should be remembered that our foreign ministry had announced 
India was being given a last opportunity through the Islamabad 
talks. 
  The leaders of Pakistan should not make statements on 
declare 
positions that they cannot keep or make promises they cannot 
fulfill. Such caution will assure that Pakistani people are not 
embarrassed again. Pakistan perhaps is relieved to hear that the 
Indian foreign secretary did not refuse to discuss the Kashmir 
issue. He was also pressured as the United States, some European 
nations, and Japan had insisted on starting discussions on 
Kashmir. India could not deny their order. These nations are 
investing nine billion dollars annually in India and it was 
important to obey them to make sure the investment continued to 
flow in. Perhaps India will tell these investors that the order 
to start negotiations has been fulfilled and it is their 
responsibility now to admonish Pakistan and prepare it for some 
understanding. The two points of understanding that are being 
publicized are mentioned in beginning of this article. Kashmir 
is basically the problem of the Kashmiri people and the majority 
of them live in occupied Kashmir. The people of that region are 
the ones that are fighting and making all kinds of sacrifices. 
It would be appropriate if Pakistan finds out from the freedom 
fighters if they approve the idea of an independent Kashmir or a 
Kashmir under the UN administration. There are 37 groups in 
occupied Kashmir and they have formed the All Parties Hariat 
Conference. If the United States convinces most of the groups in 
this organization to let Kashmir be put under the UN 
administration, it would be impossible for Pakistan to retain 
its declared stand after that. Pakistan will have to change its 
stand and face the embarrassment that will go with it. If the 
majority of the conference insisted on a referendum, then it 
will be important to know whether the proposed referendum will 
be limited to the choices of joining India or Pakistan or will 
there be additional options. If the Kashmiris are the ones who 
will give the opinion and the decision on Kashmir's future will 
be made according to their wishes then it is their right to 
increase the choices for a referendum. The United Nations will 
also have to accept their wishes. The United States will be very 
happy if the Kashmiris decide to remain under the United Nations 
for five or six years before the referendum is taken. India will 
not be any less pleased as it would get rid of a major problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir is Part of Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] The people of occupied Kashmir have announced their 
decision to celebrate "black day" on India's independence day. 
The purpose of this action is abrogate India's claim on occupied 
Kashmir. Celebration of the "black day" means that the people of 
Kashmir want independence from India. In this context, the All 
Jammu and Kashmir Freedom Conference has appealed to everyone to 
observe a strike in all of Kashmir. This announcement was 
endorsed by all religious, political and militant groups in 
Kashmir. The Indian administration is greatly worried by this 
announcement to observe a "black day" and has strengthened 
security measures. It has increased the number of military and 
para-military forces outside important buildings in Srinagar and 
other cities and has arrested a large number of Kashmiri leaders 
and young people. The freedom fighters are also determined not 
to allow observance of India's independence day in occupied 
Kashmir. They plan to respond strongly if the Indian military 
tries to ruin their plans for observing a strike and 
demonstrating. In addition to this effort in occupied Kashmir, 
Kashmiris living in capitals and important cities of other 
countries will demonstrate against India and demand resolving 
the Kashmir issue according to the UN resolutions. The Indian 
security forces will use force to foil the "black day" plans, 
however, it will not reap any political benefit from it. The 
international community knows that Kashmir is a disputed 
territory and the people there are fighting against India's 
occupation. 
  The Kashmiris are not alone in their efforts to get rid of 
the Indian occupation. Azad Kashmir and Pakistan will observe 
solidarity day with Kashmiris on 5 February. The Jamaat-i Islami 
had first announced to observe this solidarity day. Later, Nawaz 
Sharif, the opposition leader and president of the Muslim 
League, appealed for a general strike to show solidarity with 
the Kashmiri people. The government also announced to observe 
general strike on 5 February to protest India's occupation of 
Kashmir and the atrocities it is committing on Kashmiri people. 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto expressed solidarity with the 
Kashmiris to the nation in a speech broadcasted on Monday 
evening. She said Kashmir is Pakistan's artery and she herself 
was going to present the case in the UN Human Rights Commission. 
The 5 February strike will prove that Kashmir belongs to an 
undivided nation. The prime minister loudly announced in her 
speech that Kashmir is a part of Pakistan and is our legacy. 
This problem will not be solved until India agrees to a 
political solution. Some people believe that Madam Benazir 
Bhutto had not said anything new about India, except that her 
tone was sterner. It is believed that Pakistan's attitude about 
Kashmir has become stricter now. 
  Whatever the reason, the government has begun to believe now 
that the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved by talks with India 
and Pakistan must take some effective steps to help the 
Kashmiris. The prime minister took the right step by supporting 
the solidarity celebration for February. This would make up for 
the government's mistake of holding talks at foreign secretaries 
level. The cooperation between the government and the people 
will help present the Kashmiri issue to the world more 
effectively. India will learn that the people of Kashmir and 
Pakistan are united against it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Occupied Kashmir--Indian Republic Day or Black </F>
Day?"] 
  [Text] India observed its Republic Day the other day with 
pomp and pageantry, publicly displaying for the first time its 
devastating Prithvi missile and demonstrating its might to 
Pakistan and other neighboring countries. The steps taken by 
India, such as the use of closed-circuit televisions, to deal 
with any possible danger on that day in various cities, 
particularly in occupied Kashmir, indicate that the Indian 
authorities were driven by an unknown fear that prompted them to 
show off their military might and declare their desire for 
supremacy. The way the Kashmiri mojahedin shattered the Indian 
troops' tight security steps by firing volleys of missiles and 
rockets on Srinagar and targeting 30 military camps testifies to 
the fact that India, despite all its oppressive strength and 
repressive machinations, could not dampen the morale of the 
highly-spirited fighters of the independence movement in Kashmir 
who are fully capable of making their existence felt wherever 
and whenever they like. The fleeing of Indian security forces 
and even the adviser to the Kashmir governor in the face of the 
mojahedin's unrelenting barrage of missiles on Bakhshi Stadium 
prove that India is maintaining its hold on Kashmir only with 
the help of its oppressive measures. Every individual, even a 
child, in Kashmir detests India and aspires to get rid of its 
clutches. Turning Indian Republic Day into a Black Day in 
occupied Kashmir is in fact a message to the United Nations and 
a call to Western countries to ignore their selfish interests 
and rid the Kashmiris of Indian domination. Otherwise, the 
people of Kashmir will smash this yoke and chain of slavery 
themselves.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Russian Support for Kashmiris' Right to </F>
Self-Determination"] 
  [Text] Talking to the JANG representative at Davos, Russian 
Minister Yegor Gaydar has said that Russia supports the 
Kashmiris' right to self-determination, adding that we have 
gotten rid of the agony of the Soviet Union on the basis of 
self-determination. Earlier, Russian President Yeltsin, in a 
letter to the Indian Government, expressed his concern over the 
blatant violation of human rights by the Indian security forces 
in occupied Kashmir and urged the Indian rulers to stop the 
atrocities. It was not only the United States and other Western 
countries that had kept patting India on the back for not 
implementing the UN resolutions on holding a plebiscite on the 
Kashmir issue, but Russia, too, which, during the Soviet Union 
era, openly supported India on the issue. This had been the 
Russian posture all along--from vetoing Security Council 
resolutions against India to Nikita Khrushchev's outright 
rejection of Kashmir as an issue. 
  Recent statements by personalities holding the most 
important 
positions in Russia on human rights violations in occupied 
Kashmir and in support of the Kashmiris' right to 
self-determination indicate the emergence of a positive change 
in the Russian foreign policy after the disintegration of the 
erstwhile Soviet Union. This can be termed as a welcome 
development for the resolution of this long-standing issue. The 
shift in the Russian stand on occupied Kashmir --no matter 
whether due to a greater awareness in the United States and 
other Western countries of the human rights violations in the 
valley, or to the tough resistance by the Kashmiris -- is a good 
and welcome change that will help secure an early solution to 
the Kashmir problem.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kashmir--Amanullah's Role"] </F>
  [Text] Amanullah Khan, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front 
[JKLF] Chairman, has announced that his political ideology is 
guided by an ideology based on the spirit of freedom, 
patriotism, and complete sovereignty of the Jammu and Kashmir 
state. He emphasized that not only the JKLF leadership but also 
a majority of members from other parties are in favor of the 
"third option." He added that he has been supporting this 
ideology for three decades. So far as his statement that he has 
been propagating the ideology for the full sovereignty of 
Kashmir for three decades is concerned, it is imperative to note 
that the "third option" rubbish is both illogical and 
unjustifiable. This is due not only to the fact that it is 
against Pakistan's security, the formula for the partition of 
the Indian subcontinent, and UN resolutions, it is also against 
the spirit of the Kashmiri people witnessed in the form of a 
freedom movement since the time of the Dogra rulers. The 
Kashmiri people have also been shown this spirit in the hoisting 
of the Pakistani flag in occupied Kashmir on Pakistan's national 
day, ignoring the rain of bullets and curfew restrictions. 
Until today, the Kashmiri people have raised only one voice, 
that is, annexation with Pakistan through a plebiscite. 
Amanullah Khan, who is raising his voice for a sovereign 
Kashmir against this "popular will" of the Kashmiri people, is 
actively clamoring for it at a time when the United States is 
also exerting pressure for some solution. And the American 
attempt is apparently aimed at imposing India over China's head 
through a sovereign Kashmir [sentence as published]. 
  Even if we accept that Amanullah Khan has been recommending 
the third option for three decades, he cannot be justified in 
propagating this idea. Which democracy permits the domination 
of a baseless ideology of any so-called leader against the 
wishes of the people and the interest of the nation? The 
reality is that the people of Kashmir are opting to join 
Pakistan. Of course, if any leader wants the third option, it 
is entirely a different matter which has nothing to do with the 
spirit of the Kashmiri people. The sole objective of having a 
sovereign Kashmir state is to make this region a base for 
American conspiracies against Pakistan and China. The people of 
Kashmir also have faith in the ideology of the father of the 
nation, the great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah, that Kashmir is 
the jugular vein of Pakistan. In addition to the parties taking 
part in the freedom movement, every Kashmiri wants to seek help 
from Pakistan alone at this delicate moment. The reason is that 
every Kashmiri considers himself a Pakistani and the basic 
element of their freedom movement is exercising the right to 
self-determination and making Kashmir a part of Pakistan. In 
the craze for building his own sandcastle, Amanullah Khan cannot 
mutilate the history of the freedom movement of Kashmir, nor can 
the so-called ideology he has recommended get the approval of 
the people of Kashmir. The JKLF itself in the occupied valley 
does not support a sovereign Kashmir. The viewpoint of the 
Kashmiris is quite clear.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohammed Raza Allah Al-Muslim: "Kashmir: Waiting </F>
for Pakistani Conqueror"] 
  [Text] Heaven on earth, Kashmir, is spread across 83,000 
square miles in the northeast part of Pakistan, with 5.2 million 
people, the majority of whom are Muslims. Of this land, 58,000 
square miles are under India's control and have been, since 
1948, when India forcibly occupied it. India has made the people 
there its slaves. But they are not willing to accept Indian 
slavery at any cost, and they have proved this from India's 
partition through India's conspiracy (1971). In every war, the 
people here helped the Pakistani military against India. In 
every war, India faces awful embarrassment here. Still, after 
its military successes, the Kashmiris were unsuccessful. Be it 
the Gurdaspura crisis of 1947, the UN interference drama of 
1948, the Tashkent Pact after the 1965 war, or the Shimla Pact 
after the 1971 war, whenever the Kashmiris were at the door of 
independence, they were forced again to wear the shackles of 
slavery for one reason or another. This time around, they took 
advantage of the Afghanistan jihad and started a similar 
struggle with similar feelings and zeal. It seems that, along 
with winning their freedom, they will also succeed in the 
disintegration of India, in the same way the Soviet Union was 
disintegrated. 
  The freedom struggle of the Kashmiris is very old. Many 
times 
the harvest of their freedom struggle was ready; however, the 
"farmers who lacked strategy" were unable to reap this harvest 
appropriately, and they ruined it severely. After the fall of 
the Moguls in 1846, the region of Kashmir was sold to an 
atrocious Dogra king, Ghulab Singh, for 7.5 million rupees. The 
Kashmiri Muslims, fed up with Ghulab Singh's atrocities, began a 
struggle for independence in the beginning of the 20th century, 
one that is still going on. It has arrived at a point where 
hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris have been martyred and the 
perfume emanating from their sacrifice is spread all over the 
world. The mutilated bodies of the martyrs traveled through the 
River Jhelum and the Sindh and shook up the people living on the 
shores of the Arabian Sea. These scenes were broadcast on 
satellite TV to the whole world, exposing the wicked, scary face 
of India. The whole world has heard the echoes of the slogans of 
the Kashmiri people and understands the relationship of the 
Kashmiri people with Pakistan. 
  May Allah grant the Kashmiri people freedom from India this 
time, so they do not become the victims of another devilish 
decision. Amin! It appears that as Kashmir's struggle for 
freedom gains momentum, "political harvest quails," which 
actually are instrumental in the hands of enemies of Islam, are 
suggesting all kinds of solutions to the Kashmir problem. They 
will never benefit Pakistan, Kashmiris, or the Islamic world. 
  What do the Kashmiris want? One may learn by seeing 
documentary films about Kashmir. The open eyes of the martyred 
people, the green flag in the hands of the martyrs, and the 
slogans of joining Pakistan that are on their lips all appear to 
be waiting for a victor coming from Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Criminal Silence of the International </F>
Community"] 
  [Text] At present, in two regions of the world--occupied 
Kashmir and Bosnia--a lot of atrocities are being committed, and 
human rights are being violated. The international community, 
however, is sitting like a silent spectator. The United Nations 
and major powers worldwide do not feel the need to play their 
required role in obtaining the right of self-determination for 
the Kashmiris or the protection of Bosnia. When it comes to the 
interests of the United States and European nations, the United 
Nations and its Security Council suddenly become very active. 
The silence of the world over the present situation in occupied 
Kashmir and Bosnia is deplorable and unbearable. Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto addressed a meeting of the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva and tried to call the attention of the 
international community to the problems in occupied Kashmir and 
Bosnia. She said, "The present situation in Kashmir is 
unacceptable, and so is the silence of the world." The prime 
minister made it clear to the meeting's participants that the 
people of Kashmir have a very simple desire: independence. "You 
cannot suppress the freedom fighters for very long," Bhutto 
said. "Atrocities and extremities cannot last very long. This is 
a lesson of history, and despite India's atrocities and 
suppression, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have made its 
efforts futile." Madam Benazir Bhutto has definitely advocated 
the interests of the people of Kashmir very effectively. Her 
speech was greatly praised and the issue was declared a great 
cause of concern. The real problem, however, is to see if the 
international community will do something to stop Indian 
atrocities against the Kashmiri people and whether they will 
help them gain their right to freedom. In the past, the United 
Nations and other international forums praised the efforts of 
Pakistani representatives and diplomats; however, they did not 
take any practical steps to help the Kashmiris get their 
independence. The conscience of the international community is 
dead, and it is not willing to do anything to stop the savage 
acts of the Indian armed forces in Kashmir. In this situation, 
relations between India and Pakistan have become extremely 
tense. Pakistan tried to resolve this issue by holding talks, 
but India's stubbornness prevented it from making any progress. 
Pakistan has not proposed any new plans. Instead, it is still 
firm on the principle of resolving the Kashmir issue of 
independence through the UN resolutions. If India continues to 
violate human rights in occupied Kashmir and practices its 
stubbornness in declining to recognize the right of Kashmiris to 
freedom, then there will be no guarantee of peace in South Asia. 
Resolution of the Kashmir problem according to the wishes of the 
Kashmiri people is very important for establishing peace in 
south Asia.

<F P=106> [Article by Syed Anwar Ghalib: "Prime Minister Benazir </F>
Bhutto's Kashmir Policy"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's concern about 
Kashmir has doubled now because of the problems in 
Kashmir-occupied India and the increased skirmishes between 
Kashmiri freedom fighters and Indian troops. That is why she has 
announced a nationwide government holiday on 5 February to show 
support for the armed efforts of the freedom fighters in 
Kashmir. By showing full government support, she has shown 
Pakistani Government's moral, political, diplomatic, and native 
unity with Kashmir. She has thus stimulated the whole nation 
against India so that India can be embarrassed, disgraced, and 
humiliated in front of the whole world. The prime minister of 
Pakistan had shown unprecedented softness, leniency, pragmatism, 
and goodwill about Kashmir during Rajiv Gandhi's government. 
This ended during V.P. Singh's time when Mr. Mohan Singh was 
appointed the governor. Benazir herself had ended this approach 
in the Pakistan memory tent during the golden jubilee 
celebration of the Lahore Resolution. This was her most famous 
government-sponsored rally. Benazir Bhutto had decided the PPP 
policy and political action related to Kashmir on the advice of 
ISI and high military officers. She has thus made the anti-India 
politics of fundamentalists and religious fanatics ineffective 
among the people. The young prime minister using her quick wit 
has become the leader of the hot-blooded people who want to 
raise Pakistan's flag on Delhi. The United States and India 
still consider her more liberal than Nawaz Sharif. However, the 
intensity of her attitude towards Kashmir and India will make 
her more acceptable to the United States as compared to Mohammed 
Nawaz Sharif. The prime minister's belief is based on her late 
father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's declaration that if necessary 
Pakistan will fight with India for a thousand years. Mrs. 
Benazir Bhutto, to counter the great internal pressure over 
Kashmir, has decided to follow the policy of going with the 
people. The protest strike of 5 February actually declares her 
government's intention to make Kashmir an international issue at 
any cost and will use its all resources to this end. Benazir 
Bhutto's appeal asking people to observe a strike for Kashmir 
has been so strong and effective that even her chief opponent 
Mian Nawaz Mohammed Sharif has announced his unconditional 
support for her. He has announced his decision to cooperate with 
the government to help make the government's strike plans 
against India successful. This will be the second most important 
strike after the Indira-Abdullah pact in which the whole 
government machinery will be joined by the joint opposition 
groups. After the 5 February strike and using it as a 
referendum, the government will find it easier to present a bill 
to nullify the Shimla pact in the Parliament. No internal or 
foreign efforts can be made to ask for Kashmir's total 
separation from India, its joining Pakistan, or becoming 
independent as long as the Shimla pact is there. That is why 
Benazir Bhutto has decided to follow her new policy.

<F P=106> [Article by Mohammed Gayur: "Has the Conscience of the Lone </F>
World Power Awakened?"] 
  [Excerpts] The international situation has been changing so 
rapidly and unexpectedly since September 1993 that we are dazed. 
President Clinton surprised the diplomats by mentioning Kashmir 
along with Somalia and Bosnia in his first address in the United 
Nations General Assembly. The astonishment caused by this 
announcement had not yet abated when Ms. Robin Raphel, assistant 
secretary of state, announced that the United States did not 
recognize the documents that Kashmir's Maharajah Hari Singh had 
signed merging Kashmir to India. This was followed by Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao's congratulatory letter to Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto in which he had for the first time offered to 
discuss all the aspects related to Kashmir. At that time, the 
first impression was that the Indian Government was trying to 
move the situation created by the siege of Hazratbal to its 
advantage by offering to open negotiations. This could have been 
one reason for this action. However, if we review the 
developments during September and October 1993 and look at the 
statements issued by the U.S. State Department showing that the 
United States has been pressuring both India and Pakistan to 
resolve this issue by talks, the whole situation becomes a bit 
clearer. One reaction would be: God what is going on? 
  Until a few years ago, the United States was not willing to 
hear anything about Kashmir. Whenever, the issue was brought up, 
it was tabled by referring to the Shimla Agreement. Now it is so 
interested that it is considering Kashmir as one of the three 
major problem areas in the world and has put so much pressure to 
resolve this issue that foreign secretaries of India and 
Pakistan had to hold talks. Despite Madam Bhutto's direct 
statement that it is useless to waste time on meaningless talks, 
it is certain now that there will be additional rounds of talks 
between India and Pakistan even when they are meaningless. 
  What is the reason for this effort to win our friendship? 
Has 
the freedom struggle of occupied Kashmir pulled at the U.S. 
conscience? Their sacrifices definitely are enough to awaken any 
sleeping conscience. The occupied Kashmir has been facing 
devastation since January 1990 when the Kashmiris took up 
weapons. According to international news agencies, at least 
16,000 persons have lost their lives. Front doors of hundreds of 
homes are knocked on at night and the young men there are 
arrested. Their bodies are given to a nearly police station the 
very next day. Many a virtuous young woman fall prey to gang 
rape by the Indian soldiers. Many unblossomed young women were 
trodden under the boots of Indian soldiers. These sacrifices 
could wake up even the most ruthless of hearts. However, did the 
conscience of the sole world superpower wake up because of these 
sacrifices? We wish it was true. Unfortunately, the conscience 
of a superpowers is controlled by its vested interests. What 
U.S. interests are related to Kashmir? [passage ommitted on U.S. 
relations with China] 
  This difference in stand on international affairs is the 
main 
reason for enmity between China and the United States. Thus, if 
the United States manages to take the Kashmir valley and areas 
north of it under the U.S. control, then it will have succeeded 
in surrounding the newly liberated nations in Central Asia on 
the one side and China on the other side. In the ring around 
China, the Philippines in the east and South Korea are also U.S. 
allies. 
  Some of our analysts do not agree that the United States 
needs to put a ring around China and Central Asia. They believe 
that space intelligence or intelligence through satellites has 
made so much progress that the United States does not need 
Peshawar to monitor any country. It was 30 or 40 years ago when 
the United States needed Badber near Peshawar to set up a base 
to monitor the Soviet Union. The Pakistani government had very 
kindly given control of Badber to the United States from where 
the U-2 planes were used to take off to photograph Soviet air 
bases. Even Pakistan's president did not have the permission to 
enter that base. It was this base from where Gary Power's U-2 
had flown when it was shot down in Central Asia. Khrushchev, 
then president of the Soviet Union, had drawn a red circle 
around Peshawar at that time. The situation has changed now. The 
camera mounted on satellites flying hundreds of miles in the 
space can take picture of not only air bases but also of 
bedrooms. Even the privacy of a closed room is not safe from 
these now. Why should they need a monitoring station on earth in 
this situation? This sounds logical, however, just like a rifle 
is the basic weapon of a soldier in this age of guided missiles 
and rockets, the importance of a land monitoring station has not 
diminished. Especially, for putting psychological pressure on 
the enemy. 
  What plan could the United States have to take control of 
Kashmir? Before considering this, we have to review two other 
incidents. [passage ommitted on Pressler Amendment] 
  Thus, the mention of Kashmir by the U.S. President in his 
address to the UN General Assembly, Assistant Secretary Raphel's 
challenging Kashmir's ever having joined India, the possibility 
of ending the Pressler Amendment, and not including Pakistan in 
the list of terrorist nations are all events which need to be 
viewed as in a series rather than in isolation. The purpose of 
these appears to be putting pressure on India and Pakistan to 
"flatten them." 
  There are two problems. One is to open up Indian and 
Pakistani nuclear installations for international inspection and 
the other is creating such a solution of the Kashmir problem 
that U.S. interests are served. If Kashmir remains in India, no 
India government, despite its enmity with China, will allow the 
building of U.S. bases. If Kashmir joins Pakistan, perhaps 
because of its traditional loyalty, Pakistan may agree to the 
United States demands. Even during the peak period of 
Pakistan-China friendship, the PIA [Pakistan International 
Airlines] planes were used for spying on China. It would be 
impossible to convince India to give the Kashmir valley to 
Pakistan. This approach would be very dangerous because of the 
fundamentalist groups in occupied Kashmir. If Azad Kashmir with 
some modifications is given to Pakistan, Jammu and Laddakh are 
given to India, and areas lying north of Kashmir become 
independent, the picture would be complete and this is what the 
U.S. option appears to be. 
  The problem is that both India and Pakistan find it 
difficult 
to accept this. India calls Kashmir its integral part. Pakistan 
has paved its way for connection with China through the northern 
region. Therefore, it would not be easy to convince either of 
them. However, if necessary, they should be forced to accept it. 
Even a very brief war between the two countries could exhaust 
their resources. Even after another Tashkent or Shimla pact, the 
United States will be very careful about it. President Clinton 
has received several jolts in his foreign policy implementation 
during the first year of his presidency. He had to recall the 
peace forces from Somalia. He has failed in imposing 
restrictions on weapons for the Muslims in Bosnia even after 
making several announcements to this effect. He has been 
unsuccessful in making friends in South America. Therefore, it 
is likely that he will think seriously before he takes another 
step. It took 13 years after the Camp David Agreement to hold 
conciliatory talks between Israel and the Palestinians. It 
appears that he will not take any hasty action. However, Kashmir 
is on the U.S. agenda, and it is the first time that it has been 
included in it.

<F P=106> [Article by Nisar Ahmed Qaim Khani: "India's Attitude </F>
Towards Kashmir and the Possibility of War"] 
  [Text] The decision of Pakistan's Government to "try its 
best to raise the Kashmir issue at the United Nations" and to 
unmask India's atrocities at every forum is a correct and timely 
decision. Our prime minister is taking a step in the right 
direction by dismissing plans to hold direct talks with India. 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in her speech to the Kashmir 
Committee that she will not fall prey to any kind of expedient 
move. This dispute is a life and death issue for Pakistan and 
the government will use all its resources to resolve this issue 
according to the UN resolutions and the desire of the people. 
She told the nation, "No power in the world can stop us from 
helping the Kashmiri people. Kashmir is burning and we cannot 
leave it alone. We must stop the Indian atrocities. Kashmir is 
not only our heritage but also our history." She further said 
that Pakistan will gave examples of human rights violations in 
occupied Kashmir to the UN Human Rights Commission. "I will 
present the case of Kashmir to the Human Rights Commission 
personally. Our efforts are aimed at making the world aware of 
this problem and wakening the world conscience." We know that at 
times the world opinion is full of double standards. However, we 
must continue our political, diplomatic, and moral efforts in 
this changing world. We are sure that in the long run these 
efforts will bear fruit and Kashmir will win its right to 
self-determination." The prime minister's decision makes it 
clear that the government is determined to talk about the 
Kashmir issue on every platform and its stand on this issue is 
correct, solid, and clear. 
  The year 1994 can be a very important year for Kashmir. This 
is the final round of struggle for independence in occupied 
Kashmir. All Kashmiris are willing to embrace death and the 
people are supporting the freedom fighters. This was related by 
U.S. correspondent Martin Sugarman after spending one month in 
occupied Kashmir. Despite strict restrictions on journalists in 
Kashmir by the Indian security forces, Martin Sugarman traveled 
the valley extensively as a tourist. He said that there is no 
other example in the world of what is happening in occupied 
Kashmir. The people are totally unarmed and have risen against 
the third largest military force in the world. No outside hand 
is behind this freedom struggle. He said that calling their 
struggle foreign interference is an insult to the Kashmiri 
people. He said that India was not willing to permit any human 
rights organization or journalists to observe its dirty game. He 
had gone there as a tourist and had to be very careful during 
his one month's visit there. Three Iranian journalists who were 
in occupied Kashmir as tourists were caught by the security 
forces. These three died during interrogation by the security 
forces. 
  A large number of British Parliamentarians assured their 
support for self-determination to the Kashmiris and ending 
Indian atrocities there. They have expressed their determination 
to raise the Kashmir issue in the Parliament. They had made this 
announcement while addressing the university where Sultan 
Mehmood Chowdhery, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation 
Front, works. Rogers Godsave, chairman of All Parties Kashmir 
Parliamentary Committee, has assured that 60 members of his 
committee will continue to support the Kashmiri people in the 
British Parliament. These statements make it clear that the 
whole world feels the need to resolve the Kashmir issue and the 
world opinion is against the atrocities India is committing 
there. Even India's friend, Russia, has expressed a similar 
reaction. Russian President Boris Yeltsin had expressed concern 
over human rights violations in occupied Kashmir in a letter to 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao and has asked India to solve this 
problem equitably. Even India's friends that support it over 
Kashmir are pressuring India not to delay an impartial 
resolution of this problem. The Indian security forces are 
involved in such hair-raising crimes as killing innocent 
Kashmiris, burning houses, and mass rape under the pretext of 
implementing the Public Security Act and the Terrorism Control 
Act. These incidents have shaken up the international conscience 
and are being condemned everywhere. All nations in the world and 
international human rights organizations are aware of this 
"Indian bestiality" and are raising voice against human rights 
violations and torture committed on Kashmiri people. Each 
passing minute sees increase in the volume in this voice. The 
whole world is aware and actively asking to accelerate efforts 
to solve this problem. Indian actions are condemned by the whole 
world. India cannot face this international pressure for long as 
India is already isolated in the international community. Even 
public opinion in India is changing. The thoughtful press there 
and Inderjit Gupta, a prominent Indian parliamentarian, have 
expressed their opinion against the Indian actions in occupied 
Kashmir. The Indian people have begun to question why are they 
fighting a losing war in Kashmir. The Indian people believe that 
their government's policy is not right. In addition, according 
to an Indian estimate, India is spending 180 to 200 million 
rupees per day in Siachen at a time when the people are dying of 
hunger on footpaths and streets. The Indian economy has 
deteriorated. The Indian armed forces have lost their fortitude 
and an army without fortitude cannot win. Therefore, India 
should forget that it can control Kashmir with the army for 
long. The sooner India agrees to resolve the Kashmir issue 
according to the UN resolutions, the better it would be for 
India itself. The present situation is very dangerous to India's 
internal stability and security. 
  Kashmir has become the worst example of atrocious actions 
and 
human rights violations. According to the reports issued by the 
Amnesty International, Asia Watch, and other human rights 
organizations, 30,698 Kashmiris have been killed between January 
1992 and September 1993. Four thousand three hundred and eighty 
incidents of rapes have been recorded. Extreme torture has 
resulted in the death of 4,574 persons. In addition to this all, 
more than 40,000 persons are in various jails and an equal 
number is missing. However, the brave Kashmiris are still 
fighting. 
  The Kashmiri freedom fighters have opened a new chapter on 9 
January 1994 in the history of their four year struggle. They 
attacked the radio system complex at the Avantipura airport in 
southern Kashmir and killed nine Indian airmen and officers. 
This was the first time that Kashmiri freedom fighters had 
entered a sensitive military zone and returned without any 
casualties after killing nine Indian soldiers. High Indian 
officials and military officers were greatly perturbed by this 
incident. The Indian defense forces have declared this incident 
to be very threatening. According to news received from Jammu, 
the Kashmiri freedom fighters took a light machine gun, a sten 
gun, five self-loading rifles, and a wireless set from the 
Indian ordinance storage. 
  This incident is a new development in the struggle of 
Kashmiri freedom fighters and points to the new turn their 
efforts have taken. The Kashmiri freedom fighters have given a 
warning to the Indian government and high-level military 
officials through this attack on the Indian air base to stop 
crossing all the limits of atrocities, think about the 
consequences, and protect themselves from the vengeful 
activities of the freedom fighters. 
  India has also started "aggression" in the areas bordering 
Azad Kashmir. At the same time, it is threatening Pakistan with 
a war. This situation is dangerous for peace in South Asia and 
the international community should take immediate notice of it. 
It should not only increase pressure on India to resolve the 
Kashmir issue, but also announce through the United States, 
Russia, Great Britain, France, and other major world powers that 
economic defense and space air space restriction would be 
imposed against India. The Kashmir situation has reached a point 
where war between India and Pakistan could erupt any time. If 
this war starts, we cannot say what horrible results this 
continent and the world will face.

<F P=106> [Interview with Raja Zafar-ul Haq by Irfan Siddiqui; place </F>
and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Siddiqui] You keep a very close eyes on foreign 
affairs, especially those related to the problems of the Islamic 
world. What is your opinion of the present situation in Kashmir? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] Briefly, I would say that Kashmir is a living 
example of India's atrocities, Pakistan's mistaken policies, the 
unprecedented brave struggle of the Kashmiri people, the 
helplessness of the Islamic world, and the biased policies of 
the international community. There are 27 places in the world 
where human rights are being seriously violated. The deplorable 
fact is that 23 of these 27 places are populated by Muslims. 
Kashmir is the most prominent place among them. The present 
movement has resulted from Indian atrocities. India has gone to 
extremes in committing atrocities during the last four years. 
But it failed to crush the freedom struggle. I believe that 
since the partition of the subcontinent, the campaign in Kashmir 
has never been so widespread or powerful as is now. India has 
changed governors here three times during this period, and every 
new governor has claimed that he would crush the movement in 
little time. Krishnarao said in an INDIA TODAY interview, "If I 
get three or four more months, I will break the backs of those 
who want independence." India is continuously increasing its 
military forces, but the more the number of Indian troops 
increases--and it increases along with atrocities--the stronger 
the independence movement becomes. Thousands of people have 
become the prey of bullets. Those in jail are being killed and 
tortured. Houses, shops, and villages are being burned. There 
has been a rapid increase in the incidence of rapes. The 
movement is still going on, and perhaps it will be impossible 
for India to crush it. 
  [Siddiqui] What can you say about the success of this 
movement? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] I have no good expectations from India's 
treachery and stubbornness. It does not support resolving the 
Kashmir issue peacefully, by sitting around a table or by 
holding a plebiscite according to the UN resolution. We have 
learned over the centuries that when a community decides to 
break the shackles of slavery and is willing to make any 
sacrifice to do so, then no power can keep that community 
enslaved with military force and weapons. The sooner India 
understands this, the better. 
  [Siddiqui] Has there been any change in international 
attitudes? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] As I mentioned earlier, Kashmir has gotten 
the 
world's attention by making sacrifices. Now CNN, the BBC, the 
Voice of America, and the Voice of Germany are airing news 
stories about human rights violations there. Last year (1993), 
the UN secretary general mentioned the situation in Kashmir in 
his annual report after a long time. The U.S. President also 
declared Kashmir a disputed area for the first time in his 
speech to the General Assembly. The countries that adopted a 
neutral stand have started to talk openly about the sacrifices 
of the Kashmiri people. But I would still say that the world's 
conscience has not bothered enough to put pressure on India and 
to force it to accept the promises made at the international 
level. In this context, Pakistan has an important responsibility. 
  [Siddiqui] Has Pakistan met its responsibility? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] Unfortunately, I must say that the attitude 
of 
the present government on Kashmir does not reflect the desires 
of the people. This government is fixated on keeping India 
happy. The people of Kashmir have made great sacrifices and have 
worked tirelessly to present their case to the world. They have 
been successful in this effort. The concrete result of their 
efforts should have emerged, in the UN resolution in which the 
attention of the Security Council was brought to the Indian 
atrocities. This resolution had recommended that the Security 
Council visit occupied Kashmir and investigate the human rights 
violations there. The passing of this resolution would have been 
a major diplomatic defeat for India, and its true face would 
have been unmasked to the whole world. During that period, there 
was also strong pressure on India from within, and after a long 
time, India found itself in a very troublesome situation. It had 
neither time nor any alternatives. It was coming to face the 
Security Council forum after many years. This was the time when 
Kashmiri Governor Krishnarao said he would "crush this movement" 
if he got three or four more months. India showed great skill in 
trapping Pakistan by initiating those meaningless talks. This 
was the failure of our foreign policy. 
  [Siddiqui] Do you think that there should be no talks? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] In this era, anyone who refuses to hold talks 
loses the sympathy of the international community. There should 
be talks; however, the resolution about Kashmir should not have 
been withdrawn. If India refused to hold talks because of this 
resolution, then it would have been condemned. Now the Indian 
press is jumping with joy at the fact that because of these 
talks, India got new and unexpected relief, and our government, 
because of the people's pressure, is raising the slogan that we 
have not lost anything. We could have re-introduced the 
resolution any time we wanted. The next session of the General 
Assembly is scheduled for September 1994. How can we introduce 
the resolution again before that time? [passage omitted on 
foreign policy] 
  [Siddiqui] In your opinion, what kind of policy should we 
adopt on Kashmir? 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] Look! The first thing is, our stand should be 
clear and firm. We must have full faith in our stand. It is a 
simple fact that after the division of the subcontinent, the 
people of Kashmir, according to the agreed-upon formula, should 
have had the right to decide whether to join India or Pakistan 
by holding a referendum. The UN resolution has used the word 
"plebiscite." Later, the people added the right of 
self-determination on their own. The plebiscite should be held 
on the question of whether Kashmiris want to join Pakistan or 
India. The states of undivided India were presented with the 
same question. Confusing this with some other definition aims 
only at opening other options for Kashmir. Pakistan should know 
that there is no third option for Kashmir. In fact, there is no 
second option. There is only one option: the right to hold a 
plebiscite in Kashmir. At the same time, our government should 
present this case on the international level and provide the 
Kashmiris with more opportunities. This is not a question of 
India or Pakistan, but a question of the rights of 12 million 
Kashmiris. It is a human issue. Our present leadership puts 
forth nonsensical statements that confuse this issue even 
further. Recently, President Farooq Leghari said that Kashmir is 
the only hindrance to good relations between India and Pakistan. 
Some other politicians also have said the same. Kashmir is no 
hindrance to our good relations. The hindrance is caused by 
India and India only, which has an imperialist mentality and is 
very stubborn. It has spoiled relations with all its neighbors 
and is crazy about ruling others. Similarly, Benazir Bhutto 
said, "The way we swallowed the bitter pill of East Pakistan, 
India should be ready to swallow the bitter pill of Kashmir." 
This statement is contradictory to the facts, and it weakens our 
case. Comparing Kashmir with East Pakistan is unrealistic and 
unwise. East Pakistan was part of Pakistan. It was never a 
disputed region. In contrast, Kashmir has been a disputed area 
from day one. The prime minister's statement means that she 
considers Kashmir part of India, the same way East Pakistan was 
part of Pakistan. After sitting in the prime minister's chair, 
making such foolish statements will lead to being ridiculed by 
the world. Kashmir is not a bitter or sweet pill for anyone, but 
a solid problem that is in need of a solution. 
  [Siddiqui] India still declares Kashmir to be an integral 
part of the nation. 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] This is nothing new. The imperialists always 
think in this way. They always call areas under their control 
integral parts. But with time, everything fell asunder. At one 
time, this subcontinent was also an integral part of Great 
Britain. America declared its independence when it was 
influenced by the French Revolution, and Britain's Foreign 
Ministry issued a statement asking all countries not to 
interfere. "This is an internal affair," they said. "America is 
an integral part." When the movement for independence was going 
on in Algeria, France also sang the same song. History tells us 
that wherever the lamps of freedom are lighted, this will be the 
first reaction of the imperialists. The Kashmir issue is totally 
different, though. India's claim is totally unfounded. The day 
is not far when Kashmir will be freed from Indian clutches. If 
India does not compromise on its "part," then all other parts of 
its body will be dispersed everywhere. [passage omitted on 
Bosnia] 
  [Siddiqui] You are the secretary general of Motmar Aalim 
Islami. Please throw some light on the services of this group. 
  [Zafar-ul Haq] The basic work of Motmar is to present the 
problems of the Islamic world properly and to get the people's 
support. We are paying special attention to preparing literature 
in this context. We published literature based on facts about 
Kashmir and the Babri Masjid crisis and distributed them during 
the foreign ministers' Islamic conference. Later, we sent this 
to diplomats all over the world. Last year, at the Human Rights 
Commission meeting in Geneva, Motmar sent a deputation of 
Kashmiri women, which unmasked the Indian atrocities there. In 
June 1993, Motmar sent a group, in which I also participated, to 
the Human Rights Conference in Vienna. We sent Ilama Iqbal's 
poetry, in Persian with a Russian translation, to the central 
Asian countries. We also publish a weekly magazine which carries 
facts and news about the Muslim world. It is circulated in about 
70 countries. Last year we sent medicines valued at 83,000 
rupees [Rs] to Bosnia, and we have established a fund for 
Bosnian children. We donated Rs500,000 to this fund. Now we are 
sending Rs800,000 in aid to the Bosnian people through UNICEF. 
The Motmar is also giving scholarships to 32 students, who are 
receiving educations in different countries. We have published 
books and pamphlets about problems in the Islamic world.

<F P=106> [Article by Mukhtar Hasan: "Progress Towards Kashmir's </F>
Independence"] 
  [Text] On 5 February, the people of Pakistan will celebrate 
to show their solidarity with the people of Kashmir, and will 
declare their firm demand that the Kashmir issue be resolved 
according to the UN resolution, by holding a plebiscite in 
Jammu-Kashmir. Since 1990, this is the fifth Solidarity Day to 
support Kashmir's struggle for freedom. It was started on the 
appeal by Qazi Hussein Ahmed, leader of the Tehriq-i Islami. 
Mian Nawaz Sharif's state government in Punjab and the Azad 
Kashmir government had announced their full support for it, and 
soon the Benazir government at the Center had to follow suit. As 
a result, 5 February has attained the status of Kashmir's 
national day. The first 5 February Day, in 1989, was in memory 
of the more than 200 unarmed citizens who were killed by firing 
in Indian-occupied Kashmir. This was the beginning of people's 
movement against the oppressor, India. 
  In occupied Jammu-Kashmir, this people's defiance movement 
has spread fully to 10 Muslim-majority districts out of a total 
of 14. These include all of the six Muslim majority districts in 
Kashmir; three of the six Muslim majority districts in Jammu; 
and three districts in Laddakh, one of which is a Muslim 
majority district. The three districts of Jammu--Udhampur, 
Kathua, and the Buddhist majority district of Laddakh--are not 
fully peaceful now. Thus, the city of Jammu itself is not free 
of this movement. The same situation exists in Udhampur and Leh. 
From these 14 districts, Kathua is the only one where the 
mujaheddin have not made any remarkable achievement toward 
freedom. District Doda in Jammu area, which is a Muslim majority 
district settled on both sides of the River Chenab, is very 
important because of its strategic location. It is also the 
center of the movement, just like the Kashmir valley. One can 
judge how serious the movement here is from the fact that during 
the Indian home minister's visit to this place, freedom fighters 
attacked the helicopters of oppressive India, in which the 
minister went to Doda. The Indian army had a hard time 
protecting its home minister. 
  These incidents and details explain the situation of the 
movement in Jammu and Kashmir. This fact is clear to India, the 
United States, which claims to be the leader of the world, and 
its ally and advisor in world affairs, Great Britain. In 
addition to massacres and ravages in Kashmir, they have ignored 
the resolutions ordering a plebiscite and are now starting the 
mischief called the "third option" in order to sabotage the 
Kashmir issue, which is on the UN's annual agenda. This trick is 
actually encouraging the freedom struggle. India and the United 
States are looking for a way to make Amanullah Khan, who lives 
in the Gilgit district of northern Kashmir, the leader of all of 
Kashmir. The arrest and release of Amanullah Khan in Belgium 
recently was part of a game played by India and the United 
States. But Amanullah Khan's third option slogan and his own 
personality do not have enough clout to attract the people of 
Jammu-Kashmir toward themselves. None of the active 
organizations in occupied Kashmir agree with Amanullah Khan's 
"third option." 
  The third option is actually an Indian option because, in 
the 
arena of plebiscites, the Indian option has failed compared to 
the Pakistan option. It has failed so badly that one cannot find 
a Sheikh Abdullah or a Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed anymore. Further, 
even Farooq Abdullah, who served India as his father did for 
years, is nothing more than a political skeleton there. Thus, 
India is controlling this region with its armed forces, and 
India and its supporting world powers know that this kind of 
military occupation by spreading soldiers in every lane and 
village cannot be continued for many years. Therefore, these 
countries--the United States of America and Great Britain--have 
joined India and are trying to sabotage the freedom struggle in 
Jammu and Kashmir through the third option. The idea of the 
third option is so fallacious that when Amanullah Khan was 
recently asked why, after struggling so long to join Kashmir 
with Pakistan, he was talking about an independent Kashmir? 
Could he mention even one Hindu who had fought side by side 
along with the mujaheddin against the Indian army? Did the Hindu 
population ever join the freedom struggle, as the Muslim 
population did? In a situation when not even one Kashmiri Hindu 
has joined the struggle for independence from India, how can you 
establish an independent Kashmir? This third option seeks to 
divide the struggle for freedom and to put Jammu and Kashmir 
permanently under Indian slavery. The Muslims will be divided 
and will start to fight among themselves. The old imperialist 
formula of divide and rule is being labeled the third option in 
Kashmir. Amanullah Khan is talking in his naivete, or perhaps he 
wants to play the role of a new Sheikh Abdullah. This cannot 
remain hidden for long. 
  An independent Kashmir is just not possible. It would just 
become an imperialist base between China and the Muslim 
countries of south and central Asia. But this will be an even 
more artificial nation than is Israel, and it will have no 
ideological, geographical, ethnic, or religious coordination. 
The three regions of Kashmir, from the Sindh valley to Chalas, 
from the Kashmir valley to the Jammu hills and the semi-hill 
district, are all separate from each other. But each of them is 
bound to Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir can survive only by 
becoming a state of Pakistan and part of Pakistan. It cannot 
become a separate country, just like Sarhad or Sindh could not 
because of the inner strife these areas face. Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, veteran leader of the Kashmir committee in the 
National Assembly, recently declared the third option 
unrealistic and illegal. He said, "The people of Kashmir want to 
join Pakistan and Pakistan only. They are making sacrifices for 
this purpose, and Pakistan is their only goal." 
  At this time, despite all kinds of political differences in 
Pakistan, the Kashmir committee has formed a very strong 
platform here. This time, the strike on 5 February and the 
Solidarity Day to show support for Kashmir's freedom struggle 
are being organized under the Kashmir committee. This is the 
most appropriate opportunity to prepare this national platform 
for its next step in order to get independence for Kashmir. This 
is a good time, because there is a lot of interest in Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, who can help formulate and implement a national 
policy on Kashmir. Further, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan is not 
suffering any delusions about the Kashmir issue. 
  The platform of the Kashmir committee should be made the 
focal point of the concerted effort of the whole Pakistani 
nation. This is a very important national issue, and it cannot 
be left on the government alone, regardless of which party leads 
it. In the context of this concerted effort, it is also 
important that everyone contribute whatever they can to this 
purpose. Madam Benazir Bhutto is trusted by the West, and her 
Western connections should also be used for this purpose. The 
Jamaat-i Islami has close relations with the freedom struggle in 
Kashmir, and it should be part of this effort. Mian Nawaz Sharif 
should spend all his energy on this goal. Other leaders of our 
country should mobilize the country's people and change world 
opinion at the political and diplomatic levels. They should try 
to make progress in whatever way they can and, under the Kashmir 
committee, make these efforts organized and powerful. 
  Instead of making the success of the 5 February strike a 
goal 
into itself, we should look forward to the goal of freedom for 
Kashmir. In this context, we have to make some decisions about 
this national platform among ourselves and within this country, 
and some of these steps will be external and at the 
international level. 
  The internal decisions are: 
  1. We must make Azad Kashmir the base camp for our freedom 
struggle. We have to establish unity there that is above 
political and group loyalties. It does not matter if there is 
the government of one-party or national government in Azad 
Kashmir; the government must be formed to reach our goals of 
independence. The Azad Kashmir government should copy the 
methodology employed by the mujaheddin. 
  2. To make the people part of the struggle for freedom, they 
should be given military training in Azad Kashmir and be armed. 
They should be given light weapons at the line of control so 
they can protect themselves. The armed people in Azad Kashmir 
will have the ability to respond to India's aggression. Only 
then can Azad Kashmir be the base camp for the independence 
struggle. 
  3. A united and potent leadership of independence movements 
should be encouraged in occupied Kashmir. This leadership will 
come from occupied Kashmir and not from Azad Kashmir. The 
leaders of the Pakistani government should not repeat their 
Afghanistan jihad mistake in Kashmir, and the formation of a 
political leadership for Kashmir should start now. In this 
context, one should rise above party loyalties and, at this 
point, Sayyed Ali Gailani, former opposition leader, can emerge 
as the sole leader in Kashmir. He should be considered the 
political leader of occupied Kashmir. By rising above political 
party loyalties and acting in the greater interest of Kashmir's 
freedom, a political struggle should start under his leadership. 
One should never even think that he is the leader of Jamaat-i 
Islami of occupied Kashmir and that therefore, Pakistan's 
Jamaat-i Islami will get credit. The question here is not of 
getting credit, but of freeing this region, without which 
Pakistan's existence cannot be protected or stabilized. When a 
person from a specific party is accepted at that level, he does 
not belong to that party. In our recent history of Pakistani 
politics, Maulana Mufti Mehmood is the best example of this 
process. We can all agree on Sayyed Ali Gailani. His sacrifices, 
continuous jailing, and political background have made him the 
only person in Kashmir whom everyone can trust. Now Pakistan and 
Azad Kashmir are also expressing an interest in him. He can be 
included in negotiations with India or with any international 
group as a representative of occupied Kashmir for its freedom. 
Until now, the independence movement in occupied Kashmir has 
been like a chicken with its head cut off. When the time for 
negotiations comes, we will need a leader, and that leader is 
Sayyed Gailani. 
  The steps to be taken at the international level are: 
  1. Muslim countries, especially Iran and the Gulf countries, 
must be made aware of India's expansionist designs. Pundit Nehru 
decided that the goal for India was to control from east of the 
Suez to the Pacific Ocean, or from Iraq to Indonesia. Every 
Indian government makes this its national goal and is moving 
toward this. An economic boycott of India over the Kashmir issue 
will be a big blow to its expansionist designs. Not only will 
the path for Kashmiri independence be paved within a few months, 
but also, India would be cut down to size. In the ocean of the 
Muslim world, it is the only non-Muslim country, and it cannot 
continue living there like a crocodile. 
  2. The moral support for Kashmir's struggle for freedom does 
not mean help in words only. The real moral support is the kind 
the Muslim world provided during the Afghan struggle for 
freedom. Kashmir is a disputed territory where India has led 
aggression. The people of Kashmir, under the UN charter, had a 
right to individual and group defense. This is the stand that 
the government of Pakistan, through the Kashmir committee, can 
publicize at the international level. 
  3. From human rights issues to UN resolutions, there are 
many 
items that can be used to change world opinion about Kashmir. 
The aggressor India could be defeated at every step with these 
points. It is imperative, however, that all political powers in 
Pakistan promise to work closely and cooperatively. 
  4. Preparations must be made to present this issue at the 
United Nations at the diplomatic level, and to pave the way for 
establishing peace in this region through a UN resolution. The 
goal should be to make sure that the international community has 
no other alternative but to follow up on the resolution passed 
in the Security Council. 
  5. The last aspect of this is that India, seeing its defeat 
in Kashmir, might start a war against Pakistan. India's past 
record also points to this. But India's military grasp is not 
powerful enough to make such a mistake. This is not 1987, when 
Pakistan was occupied in Afghanistan and the people there had 
not challenged its occupation of Kashmir. Still, if India makes 
this mistake, and if the Kashmir committee and the Pakistani 
government make preparations inside the country and at the 
international level, then India will not only be defeated badly, 
but the Indian union will also come asunder like the Soviet 
Union. The end of the Indian union is possible just like the end 
of the Soviet Union, because both were established unfairly and 
by force. After the British left, instead of making this a free 
subcontinent, it has become a skeleton of nations in the form of 
an Indian union. The situation is conducive to Kashmir's 
freedom, and if our government leadership still sees Kashmir's 
independence in the American plan, then it would be a major 
blunder. [couplet] You pit your hopes on idols and are 
disappointed with Allah/Tell me what else is infidelity?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Pakistan Agrees to Allow U.S. Build </F>
Three Military Bases"] 
  [Text] Islamabad (API)--Pakistan has made an agreement with 
the United States of America to allow it to establish three 
military bases in Siachen, Azad Kashmir, and occupied Kashmir, 
in exchange for resolving the Kashmir issue. General Joseph P. 
Hoover, during his recent visit to Pakistan, has also made a 
list of the possible locations for building these bases, and 
gave that list to Pakistan. The United States and Pakistan will 
sign this pact in March. This information was revealed by PULSE, 
a weekly English newspaper published in Islamabad, through 
information collected from intelligence agencies and diplomatic 
sources. The newspaper reported that the United States, after 
this agreement on building military bases, changed its policy on 
Kashmir, accepting it as a disputed region. The United States 
has included Gilgit, Balistan, Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir, 
and Jammu-Kashmir, as well as the Aksai Chin, now under China's 
control, as part of the disputed region. The United States has 
decided to resolve the disputes of this entire region. The 
newspaper further reported that the intent of the United States 
in signing this pact with Pakistan was to end China's supremacy 
and control Central Asia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan's 
Islamic movements. Great Britain will also be used for this 
purpose. The Kashmir Press International, referring to the 
newspaper, said that the U. S. Central Command's 
commander-in-chief, General Joseph P. Hoover [as published], had 
visited Pakistan during caretaker Prime Minister Moin Qureshi's 
time. After Hoover's visit, high Pakistani government officials 
visited the United States and obtained more details about this 
plan. The decision on specific sites for these military bases, 
however, was made by General Hoover during his recent visit, 
when Benazir became prime minister. Hoover also gave a list of 
sites where the bases can be built. PULSE also revealed that a 
few days ago, a U.S. spy plane was hangered in the Islamabad 
airport for a few days. During that time, the plane made several 
flights and inspected the proposed sights. Both countries will 
sign an agreement on this plan at the end of March, and in the 
beginning of April, the United States will begin cooperating 
with Pakistan at the international level to resolve the Kashmir 
issue. According to the newspaper, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's recent reaction to the Kashmir issue was part of this 
plan, and she did this at America's bidding.

<F P=106> [Article by Irshad Mehdmood: "Panorama of Militancy in </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 will be remembered as an important 
one. During this year, while the freedom fighters won some 
glorious battles, they also faced heavy losses. They have to 
bear the misfortune of the martyrdom of their commanders. During 
the beginning of last year, India sent additional military 
forces to Kashmir. The leader of the Border Security Forces, 
Chander Prakash, made an interesting comment about the presence 
of these forces in Kashmir in an interview. He said that in the 
jungles and mountains, where even the sun's rays are not seen, 
our soldiers are busy in rebellion. 
  At the beginning of this year, Hizb-ul Mujaheddin's 
commander, General Shaib, was killed by the Indian forces in 
Srinagar. In addition, Nasir-ul Islam, leader of Jumiat-ul 
Mujaheddin; Maqbul Ilahi, leader of Hizb-ul Mujaheddin; and 
Shamash-ul Haq, the acting supreme commander, were also killed. 
All in all, the most important members of nearly all the freedom 
fighting organizations were either killed or arrested. These 
include: Khalid Gibran, Sajjad Ahmed Mir, Jaffar Jamali, Maulana 
Ilias, Jamal Afghani, Akbar Bhai and Abdulmajid Sheikh. 
Al-Jihad's commander-in-chief, Sheikh Abdulaziz, Muslim 
Mujaheddin's Master Ahsan Dar, and Dukhtran Millat's leader 
Aasia Inderabi were also arrested at one or the other time. 
  In addition to the arrests and killings, the Indian armed 
forces started burning various areas in Kashmir to put 
additional pressure on the freedom fighters. Sopore is one 
region where everyone has rebelled against India for the last 45 
years. A large number of freedom fighters are members of 
different organizations in this region. According to the Indian 
communications media, this area had become a "little Pakistan" 
that housed a strong camp of the freedom fighters during this 
movement. The hold of the freedom fighters on Sopore has been so 
strong that the Indian armed forces could never enter here. When 
they tried to attack Sopore at the beginning of the year, the 
freedom fighters not only made the military forces suffer heavy 
losses, but also took away their weapons and ammunition. Later, 
the mujaheddin had an exhibition of these weapons and ammunition 
which was viewed by thousands of people. Taking over Sopore 
became a major problem for the Indian forces. The top leadership 
of the army decided that instead of fighting the mujaheddin in 
Sopore, they would turn Sopore to ashes. Finally, on 6 January, 
they set this area on fire and cooled their fire of revenge this 
way. Yet, the people of Sopore began to help the mujaheddin even 
more, raising Pakistan's green flag over every house. The 
mujaheddin openly celebrated Pakistan's freedom on 14 August. 
The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin transferred the Pakistani flag to their 
headquarters in Srinagar. What is worse, even the prominent 
Indian magazine INDIA TODAY had to admit that Sopore is the 
capital of the pro-Pakistan group. The Indian forces, after long 
determined planning, decided that they would stop only after 
destroying Sopore. On the night of 26 December, the Border 
Security Force and other paramilitary forces joined the Indian 
army and attacked Sopore. About 150,000 soldiers surrounded 
Sopore and also received enforcement from the Air Force. Still, 
the mujaheddin counterattacked with strong force. As a result, 
the Indian forces had to retreat, and the defeated enemy, 
demonstrating its traditional "bravery," burned cities, towns, 
and mosques and crushed them under their tanks. Sayyed 
Salahuddin ordered the mujaheddin to vacate Sopore temporarily. 
The next day, dozens of mujaheds who had participated in the 
battle returned to the base camp in Azad Kashmir [Pakistan]. 
  This movement was also hurt by the arrest of popular female 
leader Aasia Inderabi. She had organized Kashmiri women and 
supported the mujaheddin. The role the women are playing in this 
movement is unprecedented in the history of the freedom struggle. 
  Since 1989, several mujahed organizations have been active 
in 
Kashmir. These organizations have played an important role in 
this jihad and in organizing attacks on Indian forces. Among 
these organizations, the largest is Hizb-ul Mujaheddin. It 
follows a military structure and is the only organization that 
has influence statewide. Most of the activities in Kashmir are 
carried out by the members of this organization. In 1990, this 
group blew up the original structure of the Wooler Barge, 
causing billions of rupees in damage to it. Similarly, in the 
last part of 1990, it led a successful attack on India's former 
core commander and governor's advisor General Zaki, in which he 
was wounded. Similarly, on 24 January 1992, Hizb blasted a bomb 
at the police headquarters in Srinagar. It took the jihad from 
the narrow confines of the valley to Jammu and Laddakh. In 1992, 
Shamsher Khan, a Hizb commander, controlled Doda for several 
hours. 
  The Hizb-ul Mujaheddin has invited mujaheddin from all over 
the world to Kashmir, welcoming them warmly on their arrival. 
They are declared "guest mujaheds." In addition to Azad Kashmir, 
mujaheddin from hundreds of other countries are guest mujaheds 
in Kashmir. The supreme commander of Hizb is Sayyed Salahuddin, 
who lived in Azad Kashmir for a few months in 1991. Indian 
military experts believe that if Hizb is removed from the 
military platform of Kashmir, things would be easier for India. 
The Hizb calls prominent Kashmiri leader Sayyed Ali Gailani its 
patron leader. At present, 70 percent of jihad activities are 
done by Hizb members. The Hizb has the honor of being the 
largest and best organized of the groups. 
  Liberation Front--It is true that the Front started militant 
activity in the valley. The Front got a lot of publicity when it 
abducted Rubiya Sayyed. This group was established by Ishfaq 
Mujeed Wani, Abdul Mujeed Sheikh, and Mohammed Yasin Malik. 
Except for Yasin Malik, the other two leaders have been killed. 
At present, the leader of the Front is Javed Ahmed Mir, while 
Amanullah Khan in Azad Kashmir is the chairman. The Front is 
composed of anti-Pakistan elements. Many of its leaders have 
declared Pakistan and India equal enemies of Kashmir. The Front 
took the political path instead of militancy. Therefore, it was 
not involved in any militant activity during the last year. 
  The al-Jihad is a sub-group of the People's League. The 
Muslim Janbaz Force and the Jihad Force are playing an important 
role in the Kashmir jihad. Prominent philosopher and politician 
Mohammed Farooq Rehmani and Sayyed Shabeer Ahmed Shah are the 
leaders of the People's League. These two leaders learned about 
fighting for Kashmir's independence from their cradles. 
Unfortunately, however, both of them went their separate ways 
because of mutual differences. The influence of this 
organization extends all over the valley; however, the Farooq 
Rehmani's group Janbaz Force is especially strong in Bandi Pura 
and Bara Mula. 
  In addition to these organizations, Ikhwan-ul Musalmoon, 
Alumar Mujaheddin, Jumiat-ul Mujaheddin, Tehrik-ul Mujaheddin, 
Harkat-ul Mujaheddin, Muslim Mujaheddin, and Hizb Allah are also 
active in the jihad efforts. All of these organizations support 
Islam and Pakistan. 
  These organizations agree on the following point for joining 
Pakistan: India is our common enemy; therefore, all efforts 
should be made to be free of Indian clutches. 
  A decision about Kashmir's future should be made according 
to 
UN resolutions, by holding a plebiscite. All have to agree to 
joining Pakistan and forming an Islamic government. 
  The real participants in the militant activity in Kashmir 
are 
those anonymous mujaheddin, whose names, deeds, and positions no 
one knows save Allah.

<F P=106> [Quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Excerpt] General (Retd) Mirza Aslam Beg has further 
elaborated his theory about the `encirclement' of China by the 
United States and the role of Pakistan and India are required to 
play in this programme. He had earlier expressed the view that 
an `independent' Kashmir was being sought by Washington so that 
it could serve as `spying post' against China within the grand 
strategy of `encirclement'. According to him, the continuation 
in force of the Pressler Amendment was a victory of Jewish and 
Hindu lobbies against Pakistan. On the American insistence that 
India and Pakistan should normalise their relations, the general 
is of the view that the two South Asian states are sought to be 
brought together as a par tof the `encirclement' policy by 
Washington. 
  Needless to say, the retired chief of the army staff is 
saying things that people want to hear, given the political 
environment in Pakistan. Because there is such a uniformity of 
intellectual opinion in the country, some rules of debate are 
not being observed, somewhat like the one way debates shown on 
PTV. At the risk of being called Jewish agent, let us look at 
the views expressed by the general who, it must be said in all 
fairness, believes in debate. Would an `independent' Kashmir be 
a good listening post against China when a much less isolated 
Nepal or even Pakistan would be available? What kind of 
`listening' would Washington want in addition to the satellite 
surveillance it already has over China? Would it want to use 
Kashmir militarily when it has missiles that can be delivered 
effectively and probably more accurately from the Indian Ocean?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Diplomatic Success on Kashmir Front </F>
and India's Consternation"] 
  [Text] A spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry has 
threatened that if Pakistan carries out its plan to introduce a 
resolution in the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva 
condemning India for violating human rights in Kashmir, then the 
next round of talks between the two countries will be canceled. 
According to the spokesman, India is very disappointed by the 
Pakistani campaign against India. 
  Pakistan took back the resolution it presented in the United 
Nations when India expressed a desire to discuss the various 
disputed issues, including Kashmir; expressed its willingness to 
add the Kashmir issue to the agenda as a separate item; and some 
friendly nations had assured Pakistan of India's serious 
interest in holding developmental talks. This resolution was 
introduced by the former government with the cooperation of some 
friendly nations. When it was taken back, it did not mean that 
Pakistan had forfeited its right to introduce it in any other 
forum of the United Nations. Providing India an opportunity for 
some constructive talks was a step to prove to the international 
community that the main stumbling block to these talks is 
India's stubbornness. Thus, Pakistan initiated talks at the 
foreign secretary level in Islamabad at the beginning of 
January. Seeing India's negative attitude, however, we fought 
India's efforts to lengthen these talks. The opposition 
expressed anger and disappointment at our government's step and 
reproached the government. The government, however, had made it 
clear that if the these talks failed, it would raise the Kashmir 
issue at every regional and international forum. 
  At present, the situation is that Pakistan distributed a 
draft of the resolution among commission members, and its 
representatives are lobbying with representatives of other 
countries to pass this resolution. Russia, the United States, 
and Great Britain have expressed displeasure at India's 
attitude, and India is worried that on 25 January, when this 
resolution is introduced in the Human Rights Commission meeting 
in Geneva, it will face failure and disappointment. Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali, 
and some diplomats have raised this issue among the 
international organizations very effectively. Therefore, it is 
expected that this Pakistani resolution in support of the 
Kashmiri people's struggle will be approved. Thus, the struggle 
of the Kashmiri people will get the moral and political support 
of the international community. 
  The fact is that the present government has not shown any 
hesitation or weakness on the Kashmir issue. Instead, Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, after giving a decisive opportunity for 
some serious talks, and after their failure, has raised this 
issue during all her foreign trips and in front of various 
international agencies. The Indian government's reaction also 
proves that Pakistan's diplomacy on this front has been 
successful, and that they are threatened by it. They have come 
down to various negative and capricious actions. Keeping in mind 
the solid efforts by our government, we can expect that the 
Human Rights Commission will approve the resolution and that the 
international community will increase its pressure on India. 
That, in turn, will force India to involve itself in 
result-oriented talks with Pakistan. Its threat of canceling the 
talks will only prove to be a false one. Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, in a speech in Lahore, expressed her support for the 
Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom. She said, "Pakistan 
supports the Kashmiri people's struggle for freedom and will 
continue to do so. We want to see the Kashmiri people free in 
the 21st century." There is no doubt that Pakistan is very busy 
supporting the Kashmiri people's cause on the diplomatic front; 
however, bearing in the mind the seriousness of this situation 
and the political ups and downs in this region and at the 
international level, we must ensure that our nation is united in 
action and thought. We lack this unity, and our weakness on the 
internal front can affect our efforts on the external front. 
Particularly in the National Assembly, the opposition's 
confrontation with the government, blocking the passage of laws, 
the making of flagrant accusations against each other, and 
starting a no-confidence campaign against the chief minister in 
the assembly have all created a situation that is unacceptable. 
All these are destructive incidents and keeping in mind India's 
attitude about the Kashmir issue, the Indian government's 
threats of war against us, and threats of some serious 
consequences all demand that we be fully united in our country 
to be effective in our foreign affairs. The nation demands that 
our politicians and leaders be aware of their responsibilities. 
Only then can we play a constructive role in making sure that 
the freedom struggle of the Kashmiri people is successful.

<F P=106> [Commentary by A.B.S. Jafri] </F>
  [Text] Pakistan's latest note on Indian annexed Kashmir 
covers all the major issues and calls for the most urgent 
attention with the utmost earnestness. This communication 
handed over to New Delhi yesterday is a model of clarity, logic 
and reason. Inevitably, the core issue of Kashmir tops the 
agenda presented by Pakistan. If there is a sincere desire to 
restore peace and tranquillity to [words indistinct] state under 
Indian military occupation, Pakistan recommends four steps to be 
taken by India. First, face and accept the fact that the people 
of Kashmir under Indian control just would not accept it 
anymore. Second, the active and operational presence of over 
half a million crack Indian Army troops militates against the 
remotest possibility of peace. Third, the massive repression of 
civilian population is unacceptable not only to its direct 
victims, but also to world conscience. And fourth, reckless 
violation of the Line of Control keeps tension at an intolerable 
level. 
  It is for India and India alone to act to remove the clearly 
defined problems. These problems have their origins in New 
Delhi and New Delhi has to act to retrieve the situation, which 
is getting more and more complicated by the minute. Those who 
would expect to effectively divert world attention from Indian 
military action and [word indistinct] rise in abuse of human 
rights ought to realize now that that (?trick) just did not 
work. India must change its direction and abandon the line 
which would only lead it into a sea of trouble. 
  Pakistan has taken up India's favorite theme of 
confidence-building measures. The six non-papers which the 
Indian Foreign Office had presented to Pakistan have been dealt 
with in detail in Islamabad note. About confidence-building, 
Pakistan points out the first and also the most convincing step 
in that direction would be a fair balance of forces in the 
subcontinent. It has recalled that this is what the United 
Nations defined as a prerequisite in its resolutions dating back 
to 1947. It made the best confidence-building strategy then; it 
does so now. 
  Pakistan and India should move toward hammering out a fair 
formula for balance of conventional forces and nonproliferation 
of the same. The Pakistan Foreign Office fails to understand 
what exactly is the connotation of India's suggestion for an 
agreement of nonuse of nuclear capability against each other. 
This doesn't make a great deal of sense because Pakistan cannot 
promise not to use nuclear capability because it doesn't have 
it. And it has not proposed to acquire it. So, that is that 
about nonuse of nuclear capability in the subcontinent. 
[sentence as heard] What Pakistan and the world community 
cannot forget however is that India is a nuclear power and if 
there is to be any promise about nonuse of nuclear capability in 
the subcontinent, it is for India to volunteer a categorical 
renunciation in this context. 
  On the Siachen flash point, Pakistan points out that India 
has made an incursion in the frozen [word indistinct] in 
disregard of the Shimla Agreement. The issue can be solved 
tomorrow if India traces its steps back to the appropriate 
point. The Sir Creek issue should cause no headache if only 
India would agree to refer it in an impartial international 
arbitration. As for the Wular Barrage issue, Islamabad has made 
note of the disappointing fact that India's non-paper does not 
address the real issue. But Pakistan is ever-willing to join 
talks with India on the subject as indeed on any subject of 
mutual interests and concern. 
  Pakistan emphasizes the fact that it agreed to wait for the 
non-papers which the Indian foreign secretary promised to 
provide during the secretary-level talks earlier this year. It 
was felt then in Islamabad that the non-paper's promise was to 
circumvent substantial talks on the core issue which is the 
future of Kashmiris under Indian control and military action. 
And it turns out to be exactly that the non-papers registered 
no progress on any issue. Waiting for them has put talks on the 
real issue back by so many weeks. Pakistan would like India to 
persuade itself that the facts of the situation in occupied 
Kashmir have now reached a point where they are unalterable no 
matter how much of military power and its deployment is resorted 
to.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Regional Peace and Security -- India Must </F>
Realize its Responsibility"] 
  [Text] During their talks in Islamabad, Chinese Vice 
Premier Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali 
stressed the need for maintaining the tempo of the existing 
bilateral cooperation to ensure regional security. The two 
leaders held in-depth discussions on regional peace and 
security, nuclear nonproliferation in South Asia, and other 
issues. They also expressed serious concern over the violations 
of human rights in Kashmir. 
  As far as the issue of regional peace and security is 
concerned, there is no denying the fact that the Kashmir dispute 
has led to Pakistan-India wars in the past, and the issue has 
now taken such a serious turn that it may lead to another war 
between the two countries. Therefore, for the establishment of 
peace in this region, the resolution of the Kashmir problem by 
granting their fundamental right to the Kashmiri people is 
highly essential. India, however, has never adopted a reasonable 
attitude toward any agreement, be it the accord for protecting 
minorities or conceding the right of plebiscite to the 
Kashmiris, or fulfilling the commitments made to the United 
Nations Security Council. India has always presented the facts 
in a distorted manner. There have been seven rounds of 
secretary-level talks, but every round has ended in a failure. 
Pakistan's sincerity is reflected by the fact that it has 
approached every round of talks with the hope that India will 
adopt a reasonable attitude, but New Delhi's objective, 
obviously, has been to buy more time to continue its oppression 
and atrocities against the Kashmiris. India has deployed more 
troops in occupied Kashmir after the latest round of talks with 
Pakistan. 
  On the nuclear nonproliferation issue, India has never given 
any encouraging response. Under these circumstances, it is the 
Indian Government's responsibility to change its attitude to 
establish real peace about which it has been carrying out hollow 
propaganda thus far.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj: "Bhutto Asks AL-HAYAH: Will </F>
the Kashmiris Meet the Same Fate as the Bosnians?"] 
  [Text] Jeddah -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
has urged the international community to intervene firmly to 
stop the inhuman practices being committed by India against the 
people of Kashmir. She called on the Security Council to take a 
firm stand in this connection. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH before leaving Medina, Bhutto 
said 
that the international community has a moral responsibility to 
ease the suffering of unarmed civilians in Kashmir. Their 
plight is the same as that of other Muslims throughout the world 
such as the Somalis, the Bosnians, and the Burmese. She pointed 
out that Pakistan has urged international organizations to 
intervene for the recognition of the Kashmir people's right to 
self-determination. She accused the Indian Government of 
dithering on this issue in order to maintain its occupation of 
Kashmir despite the mounting opposition to Indian rule among the 
majority of the population. She said that "the genocide 
operations carried out by the Indian forces against the Muslim 
population coincide with the persecution of Muslims by the 
Hindus. These moves are a prelude to a plan to impose Indian 
hegemony on the region." She warned that the "apparent failure 
of the international community will charge sentiment in the 
Islamic world." 
  Bhutto stressed that her country was making global 
diplomatic 
efforts in support of the principles of human rights, regardless 
of the legal aspects, and in support of the principles of the 
Geneva Convention for the prevention of massacres and the 
punishment of perpetrators. She asked: "Will the people of 
Kashmir meet the same fate as the Bosnians, who are the target 
of premeditated liquidation?" She added that "the struggle of 
the people of Kashmir is based on the quest for freedom, which 
is a legitimate demand in all civilized societies." She 
reaffirmed Pakistan's moral and material support "for the 
struggle of the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Addressing a press conference 
in Islamabad today Ministry for Foreign Affairs Sardar Asif 
said: "Iran and China have contacted Pakistan at the "highest 
level" requesting it not to put its resolution on Kashmir for 
voting and have made some proposals." 
  "These are our close friends and we can't ignore their 
requests," he said. "We don't wish to ignore the suggestions of 
our friends who have stood by us altogether," he added. 
  Minister for Information and Broadcasting Khalid Ahmad 
Kharal 
was also present at the press conference and answered to number 
of questions by journalists. 
  Asif said Iran and China had asked Pakistan not to press for 
voting as of total 53 members of the Commission, about 42 or 43 
have decided to abstain from voting but, "almost all of them had 
condemned human rights abuses in held Kashmir in their bilateral 
talks or at the floor of the commission. He said Iran and China 
might broker some sort of way out in this respect. 
  However, Foreign Minister said, "we have achieved our 
objective by tabling this resolution and we have succeeded in 
awakening the world opinion," he said. 
  Substantiating his contention, he said almost all the member 
countries had expressed their deep concern on the gross human 
rights violations being committed by Indian security forces in 
held Kashmir either in their bilateral talks with India or at 
the floor of the Commission. He said "we have succeeded" in 
compelling India to open up the held Kashmir for fact finding 
missions. He said a 11- member delegation was currently 
visiting Held Kashmir while one from European Community had 
already visited the valley, "though we do not agree with its 
report." 
  Information Minister mentioned the statement of American 
President Bill Clinton deploring human rights abuses in held 
Kashmir. He said European countries had also deplored the 
worsening human rights situation in held valley. "It is more 
than sufficient for us, it is great achievement of our foreign 
policy," he said adding never such a resolution was tabled by 
any government in the past. "We, at least, have the courage to 
table it," he maintained. 
  Quoting Finnish Foreign Secretary, currently visiting 
Pakistan, Shaharyar said that though his country would not vote 
for or against the resolution but "he told us actually Pakistan 
had achieved the objective by bringing this issue at frontline." 
"We have crossed a very important barrier, we have succeeded in 
making it a frontline international issue, now it is away from 
back burner," he added. 
  Sardar Asif said Pakistan would keep on raising Kashmir 
issue 
at all available international fora to draw the attention of 
world community towards worsening human rights situation in held 
Kashmir. 
  Responding to a question, Foreign Minister said Pakistan had 
not amended the resolution as reported in a section of the 
press. Elaborating the Foreign Secretary said some of the 
friends had suggested for some amendments in para 3 of the 
resolution calling for the sending of fact-finding mission to 
the held valley which had not been accepted. 
  Sardar Asif thanked Iran for helping Pakistan "achieve the 
breakthrough for Kashmiri people" and China and other countries 
who had made efforts either on the florr of the UNHCR Commission 
[UN High Commission for Refugees] or behind the scene. He 
appreciated that Iran, Australia, Columbia and Mexico emphasised 
that solution of Kashmir should be found. He said Australian 
representative had said he was fully aware of human rights 
violations in occupied Kashmir. He said it was noteworthy that 
the countries supporting Pakistan represented al the continents. 
  "The people of Pakistan can look forward to a successful 
Foreign policy of Pakistan run by the able leadership," he said. 
He congratulated Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto whose endeavour 
had led to the success of Pakistan.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, the former 
prime minister of Azad Kashmir and leader of the opposition in 
the Legislative Assembly, has urged the Government of Pakistan 
to set up an inquiry into the seizure of arms worth 20 million 
rupees by the Federal Investigation Agency and other sensitive 
organizations in Muzaffarabad. Talking to the NAWA-I-WAQT here 
on Wednesday, he said that the Muzaffarabad police led by the 
deputy superintendent of police and the director of the Civil 
Defense, raided the camp of the Al-Mujahid [a Kashmiri group] 
near Ziyarat Shah Enayat on Idgah Road and seized four truck 
loads of arms. The raid was conducted in the wake of a dispute 
between Sardar Atiq Ahmad, son of Azad Kashmir Prime Minister 
Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan; and the commander of the Al-Mujahid 
over the payment of 8.7 million rupees and the government of 
Azad Kashmir has been keeping the people in the dark and wants 
to cover up the entire issue. Condemning this attitude, Mumtaz 
Hussain Rathore said we have been expressing apprehension about 
the designs and activities of the so-called Al-Mujahid. Such a 
large quantity of arms was stockpiled not for the cause of the 
Kashmir freedom movement, but for crushing the opposition in 
Azad Kashmir and the Government of Pakistan should have the 
entire situation investigated by its agencies, Rathore added.

  [Text] Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, chairman of National 
Assembly Kashmir Committee, said that the Kashmiri people are 
determined to free themselves of Indian dominance. Speaking at 
a fast-breaking party in Muzaffargarh, he said the Kashmiris 
have risen against the repression of Indian troops and seek to 
achieve freedom. He said the Kashmir issue can only be solved 
through a plebiscite. 
  Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan said that he will call a meeting of 
the Kashmir Committee on the 20th of this month, which will be 
constituted of delegations to be sent abroad to mobilize world 
public opinion against the grave human rights violations in 
occupied Kashmir. According to APP, he said that he was not 
happy with the deferment of the voting on the resolution on 
Kashmir at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. 
  Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Group 
president, and Maulana Mohammad Ajmal Khan, acting chief of 
Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam, have also criticized the deferment of 
the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. 
  Hamid Mufti, a member of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, has 
commended the efforts being made by Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto's government to raise the Kashmir issue at various 
international agencies. Commenting on the deferment of the 
voting on the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human 
Rights Commission, he said the objectives for moving the 
resolution have been achieved. He asked the political forces to 
commend the government's efforts due to which India has allowed 
a Muslim delegation to visit occupied Kashmir to investigate 
human rights violations. Pakistan Solidarity Front Chairman 
Nabid Malik has also commended the government's efforts due to 
which India has been forced to allow the ambassadors of Muslim 
countries, Amnesty International, and other human rights 
agencies to visit occupied Kashmir.

  [Text] Islamabad, March 9 -- The Pakistan Muslim League 
PML(N) has strongly reacted to the withdrawal of resolution on 
Kashmir human rights situation from the Human Rights Commission 
in Geneva. 
  Chaudhury Sujjat Hussain, Vice President of the PML(N), 
while 
talking to THE MUSLIM on Wednesday evening termed it as a fiasco 
and said that the incumbent government had no accumen to handle 
the national issues and also lack commitment for the national 
cause. 
  "It is a black day in the struggle of Kashmiri people, who 
are rendering unprecedented sacrifices for their rights and have 
been stabbed by an unpopular government, he added. [no end 
quote as published] 
  Chaudhury Sujjat Hussain said that the PPP [Pakistan 
People's 
Party] Government had been blaming the Pakistan Muslim League 
Government for isolating Pakistan internationally but today it 
had been established that it was not the PML but the PPP 
Government that brought global isolation to Pakistan. 
  Gauhar Ayub Khan, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the 
National Assembly, has also condemned the government for 
withdrawing the resolution and said that the Prime Minister 
should immediately step down as she had brought an embarrassment 
to Pakistan, which had no parallel in the history of the country. 
  He said that it was criminal negligence on the part of the 
government that a fit case of human rights violation of Kashmiri 
people had been destroyed by the government in Islamabad. 
  Gauhar Ayub Khan appealed to the patriot workers of the PPP 
to rise against the policies of the government and act being 
above from the party politics. "I am sure now the whole nation 
has seen the true face of Benazir Bhutto's government", he added. 
  He announced that the opposition would give its official 
version about the fiasco on Thursday afternoon. 
  Mian Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the Opposition in the Punjab 
Assembly, while condemning the withdrawal of the resolution said 
that it had proved that Benazir government was engaged in 
patronising and helping out India. 
  "She is not prepared to lose any single opportunity to 
please 
India by playing with the national interests of Pakistan, which 
are no way dear to her," he said in a statement. 
  He said that track record of Benazir government had made it 
clear that as long she was sitting at the helm of affairs, the 
security of the country would remain in grave danger. 
  Mian Shahbaz Sharif appealed to the people to stand up 
against the "pro-India" government.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said Pakistan will 
continue to raise its voice in favor of the Kashmiris who are 
waging a struggle to achieve their right to self-determination. 
In an interview with the Voice of Germany, she paid glowing 
tribute to the Kashmiri brethren for their just and valiant 
struggle, and pointed out that India has sent 600,000 troops to 
occupied Kashmir to suppress the struggle of the Kashmiris. The 
prime minister expressed the hope that India will not be able to 
suppress the heroic struggle of the Kashmiris despite all its 
military might. 
  Benazir Bhutto explained in detail her government's efforts 
to project the Kashmir issue at the international level, making 
particular reference to the gross violation of human rights in 
occupied Kashmir. She said the Kashmir issue has assumed 
international status as a result of Pakistan's efforts. 
  The prime minister disclosed that before the deferment of 
voting on Pakistan's resolution at the UN Human Rights 
Commission in Geneva, India asked Iran to convey to Pakistan 
that it was ready to receive a delegation from the Islamic 
countries. Citing the actual reason for the postponement of 
voting on the resolution in Geneva, Bhutto said the voting was 
deferred because Pakistan was getting what it had planned to 
achieve with the resolution. She refuted Indian claims that the 
resolution has been withdrawn, emphasizing that the resolution 
is still effective; voting has been deferred on the condition 
that India allow delegations from Muslim countries to visit 
occupied Kashmir. If necessary, Pakistan will approach the 
commission and raise this issue again. This is the politics of 
conscience and principles, the prime minister added.

<F P=106> [Article by Rambahadur Ray: "Pakistan Intends to Spread </F>
Religious and Communal Violence in India"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, 11 February -- A regular task force is 
working in Pakistan since 1990 for operation K-2 to spread 
religious and ethnic violence in India. This task force was 
composed of Brigadier Mohammed Salim, Brigadier Javed, and Major 
Haider. A special research council is assisting this task force. 
It is composed of high military and ISI [Inter-Service 
Intelligence of Pakistan] officers. It decides how to provide 
aid to various active groups in India. The Indian Government has 
not yet made any plans to foil the Pakistani conspiracy. It is 
wasting time in other, unnecessary efforts. 
  Pakistan's Operation K-2 is a decisive effort. It was 
launched in order to acquire Kashmir. The main battle under it 
is being fought in Kashmir. In order to strengthen their 
position, small groups are being incited to spread separatism 
and violence throughout the country. The Indian Government is 
aware that Major Haider has been managing this front in the 
Kashmir Valley since 1991. After establishing his control over 
all Kashmiri groups, Major Haider entered the valley. This is an 
example of fighting against India right on its soil. He is 
working closely with terrorist organizations. 
  A U. S. Congress committee report has details of this 
operation. In December 1991, Major Haider called a meeting of 
representatives of Ikhvanul Musalmin, the Allah Tigers, Hizbul, 
and mujaheddin organizations. The decision to start a combined 
campaign was made in this meeting. This also affected the other, 
smaller organizations. At present, about 150 organizations are 
active there. This has helped the religious terrorists come 
under one umbrella. In response, the ISI increased its aid to 
them. In light of the activities of 1991, Major Haider went to 
the Kashmir valley to supervise this campaign. We can understand 
this because of the terrible fighting that occurred at that 
time. This was a very difficult period for Indian security 
forces. Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao has repeatedly said 
that Pakistan is fighting a shadow war in Kashmir. This is only 
half true. It is not a shadow war anymore, now that Major Haider 
has arrived there. During that period, the Kashmiri terrorists 
fought the security forces face to face. This is a great 
achievement for any terrorist group, and it is still going on in 
the Kashmir Valley. 
  The next year, in the summer of 1992, a large number of 
Pakistani-trained terrorists entered Kashmir. According to one 
estimate, they had 20,000 AK-47 and AK-56 rifles. During those 
days, the terrorists attacked security forces on a daily basis. 
The ones that were killed in these skirmishes included, in 
addition to trained terrorists, the Afghan mujaheddin. According 
to one estimate, between 1990 and 1992, 20,000 Kashmiri youths 
received training across the border. Brigadier Mohammed Salim 
led this training effort. These training camps were operated as 
a joint project of the ISI and the army. There are 15 permanent 
training camps in Azad Kashmir, the portion of Kashmir that is 
controlled by Pakistan. There are an additional 30 temporary 
camps. These new training centers were built for religious 
terrorists in 1992. Brigadier Javed was made their director. He 
had all kinds of experiences, through the CIA, in working for 
the ISI and the mujaheddin during the Afghan War. 
  Training camps were opened for religious terrorists in 
Gohad, 
Larkana, Sangli, Sargodha, Cuttock, Murree, Sialkot, and Lahore. 
One of these camps was operated with Iran's help. The suicide 
brigades were trained there. After that, in addition to Kashmir, 
efforts to spread terrorism across different parts of India were 
accelerated. Now they have opened centers in many places. The 
bomb blast on Palam Airport on 25 June 1991 attracted attention 
to these agencies. A bomb was found in an Air India plane on 1 
December 1991. That plane was leaving New Delhi for London. The 
Janbaz Force took responsibility for it. After that, there were 
bomb blasts in Delhi and many other cities. In August 1992, two 
Pakistanis were arrested 30 kilometers from Madras. They were 
trying to blow up a train. Police agencies have collected a lot 
of evidence from these groups. Pakistani agents were also 
involved in blowing up the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] 
office in Madras. They were conspiring to transform the 
religious tension there into a lava of violence. 
  Who is helping the Pakistani agents? The Indian Government 
is 
in the dark about this. The little information that has been 
collected mentions SIMI (Student Islamic Movement of India) 
repeatedly. According to the U. S. Congress committee report, 
the religious terrorists trust this group. The central 
investigation bureau learned about a terrorist named Surjeet 
while investigating Dr. Jalis Ansari. It was learned that he was 
working with Abdullah Shiragi. Abdullah Shiragi is a well-known 
Kashmiri terrorist. He attended the SIMI conference in 1991. 
  The Kashmiri active organization, Jamaat-i Tulba, was given 
the duty of sending its members to accept asylum in various 
parts of India. Its agents have taken different routes to go to 
India and Nepal. Jamal Alvi of Lucknow was their special agent. 
He was working for Dr. Jalis Ansari and Hilal Beg. Dr. Habib of 
Raibareilly is also considered a member of this group. 
  The central and state governments' intelligence agencies 
could not understand the network that Jamaat-i Tulba had spread. 
The government is not sure how much it hurt the Pakistani 
conspiracy in its recent arrests. The only estimates it could 
make from these arrests were related to what kind of tricks 
Pakistan was using in the war on Kashmir. It appears to be 
establishing small groups in different places that can be 
activated at its instruction when the time comes. After the 
Bombay blasts, the government was wrong to consider that the 
Memon group was operating alone. That group had finished, to an 
extent. The recent arrests has created only the scene of the 
"seed of blood." The Indian Government will not be able to 
totally destroy it with its weak efforts. 
  Before the last Independence Day, General K. V. Krishan Rao, 
the Jammu-Kashmir governor, admitted that Pakistan was planning 
to infiltrate India with a large number of soldiers. He reported 
that 10,000 Afghan mercenary soldiers were ready for it. This 
statement is also supported by a U. S. Congress committee 
report. According to the report, Pakistan has been using Afghan 
mercenary soldiers in Kashmir since 1992. During the summer of 
that year, 200 mercenary soldiers were working with the 
terrorists, and another 300 mercenary soldiers have been waiting 
since 1992. Last summer, 200 mercenary soldiers were sent into 
Kashmir. According to this report, the Kashmiri terrorists 
informed that 300 additional Afghan mercenary soldiers were 
waiting to enter since 1992. It is clear now that when CIA 
Director Robert Gates came to India in 1990, he pressured the 
Pakistani president to close the bases in Lahore.

  [Text] The World Kashmiri Pandit conference in Delhi was 
understandably an occasion for much pent-up emotion to be 
expressed. It is to be expected that a small community living in 
exile with little hope of returning soon to its home should be 
overwhelmed in equal measure by anger and sorrow. The squalor 
and humiliation of life in ramshackled refugee camps, the 
break-up of families, the loss of jobs and property and the 
abiding fear about the disappearance of their culture must all 
evoke widespread sympathy for the Kashmiri Pandits. What is 
remarkable about the gathering is that in the midst of so many 
depressing circumstances the true spirit of `Kashmiryat' 
survives. Many delegates were able to rise above their pain and 
anguish to urge the restoration of communal harmony and a 
multi-ethnic, multi-religious society in Kashmir. 
  Let there be no mistake about it. It takes exceptional 
courage and wisdom on the part of those who have suffered most 
since the ascendancy of militancy in Kashmir to cling to such a 
vision of the future. There were those, of course, who demanded 
a separate homeland where Kashmiri Pandits could feel secure. No 
one will want to blame them for this after what they have been 
through. The sense of betrayal they experienced as a result of 
the Central government's bungling on Kashmir over the years is 
also a major impetus for the feeling of separateness that has 
spread through the community. It must be hoped that in time and 
with the redressal of many of their grievances in exile and an 
improvement in the situation within Kashmir, all Kashmiris will 
learn to put their faith once again in a multi-cultural state. 
Some may, for political reasons, pander to the feeling of 
Kashmiri Pandit separateness but such counsel should be rejected 
as dangerous and self-defeating. As is evident from many parts 
of the world where ethnic conflict rages, the effort to create 
separate entities out of communities which have intermingled for 
centuries ends in terrible tragedy and the most inhuman 
suffering for all. 
  Initiatives like the World Kashmiri Pandit conference are 
important. Not only do they provide a forum to bring scattered 
Pandits together to air their problems and anxieties, but they 
are necessary to draw national and international attention to 
the plight of the exiles. Little is known, for example, about 
how much Pandit women have suffered in the last few years. There 
is much work to be done on the world stage. One can think of no 
better mechanism than a standing committee of World Kashmiri 
Pandits to inform the outside world about conditions in Kashmir 
under rampant militancy aided by Pakistan. A more important role 
would be in broadcasting to a largely ignorant western world the 
Kashmiri Pandit version of Kashmir as a harmonious, multi-ethnic 
society which Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Gujjars and many other 
communities can call their home.

  [Text] After coming to a standstill, Algerian-Libyan 
relations are being given a new boost and are being revived by 
the visit of Mr. Mohamed Salah Dembri, the foreign minister and 
personal envoy of President Liamine Zeroual, to Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi. Over to TV reporter Souria Bouamama for more 
details on the visit: 
  [Bouamama] In traditional Arab decor, Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the Libyan revolution, yesterday 
received Mohamed Salah Dembri, who handed him a letter of 
friendship and esteem from Liamine Zeroual to the leadership and 
people of Libya. During this meeting, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his 
satisfaction with Zeroual's appointment as president of state 
and wished him success. 
  On the purpose of this visit, Salah Dembri had this to say: 
  [Begin Dembri recording] This visit follows the recent visit 
which brother al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi paid to Algeria. During 
this visit we discussed ways to strengthen and bolster our 
bilateral relations. We also talked about all the issues of 
common interest, including matters concerning the situation in 
the Arab homeland, particularly the current situation in the 
Maghreb. We also talked about everything which concerns us in 
our natural environment, namely the African environment and our 
Mediterranean environment. [end recording] 
  [Bouamama] On this visit, Mr. Jam'a al-Fazzani, general 
secretary of the People's Committee for Unity, had this to say: 
  [Begin recording] [al-Fazzani] This visit is aimed at 
starting a new phase which is more advanced and clearer in the 
establishment of Libyan Arab-Algerian relations, which are based 
on a number of factors. These include the ties and bonds 
linking the two fraternal peoples, and also the principles on 
which the 1 November Revolution and the 1 September Revolution 
are based. These principles bring us closer together and do not 
separate us. 
  [Bouamama] Now that we are flying in Libyan airspace, 
despite 
the embargo imposed on Libya, how is Libya living now under the 
embargo? 
  [al-Fazzani] I am glad you have asked this question. The 
Libyan Arab people are standing fast in the face of the blockade 
because they are aware of the extent of the conspiracy being 
hatched against them. [end recording]

  [Text] The official spokesman of the government peace 
delegation to Nairobi, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, has said that the 
current peace talks in Nairobi opened amid encouraging signs, 
since all the negotiating parties are represented by high-level 
delegations. He said the presence of John Garang and Riak 
Machar would give impetus to the negotiations. 
  Speaking during an interview with Kenyan television, Dr. 
al-Hajj said the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development [IGADD] initiative was unique, since it included 
African countries adjacent to Sudan, whose problems were 
identical to Sudan's problems. He said the similarity would 
help in resolving the southern problem. 
  Meanwhile, in a telephone call from Nairobi, the official 
spokesman of the government peace delegation, Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj, 
said some negative developments had occurred during the 24 hours 
following the official inauguration of the peace talks. He said 
so-called opposition elements had sent representatives to 
Nairobi with the aim of aborting the peace talks. Dr. 'Ali 
al-Hajj said the government delegation had warned the IGADD 
group about the aims of the opposition group. He said the 
Kenyan side had been notified that peace was not a priority for 
the opposition, whose main aim was to topple the government in 
Khartoum, using the southerners as tools to do so. Dr. 'Ali 
al-Hajj said the elements who arrived in Nairobi were the same 
people who had attended the Washington Symposium and the London 
Forum under Baroness Cox. 
  He said the southern problem should not be mixed with the 
toppling of the government, and stated that the southern problem 
should come first. Dr. al-Hajj further urged all parties to 
give a chance to the IGADD countries to play their role, 
especially after the emergence of positive signs, with the rebel 
leaders attending the talks for the first time. 
  [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 0430 
GMT on 20 March adds: "His excellency appealed to the Kenyan 
Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the 
current peace efforts did not fail and that the solution should 
be purely an African one. His excellency said that the members 
of the alliance who had arrived in Nairobi were Mubarak al-Fadil 
al-Mahdi, 'Abd al-Rahman Ahmad Sa'id and al-Harith Idris. Dr. 
'Ali al-Hajj Hassan said the government delegation did not 
object to their presence provided they did so as part of the 
delegation of the rebel movement. 
  ["Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj said the entry of foreign quarters or of 
a 
foreign dimension had always been at the root of failure to 
arrive at an agreement with the rebel movement. His excellency 
appealed to John Garang to throw off foreign hegemony. He said 
the purpose of his convening a press conference was to inform 
the outside world of the facts of what was happening and to 
confirm the eagerness of the government delegation that the 
negotiations should succeed."]

Nairobi at 1000 Kenyan time, 0900 Sudanese time, under the 
supervision of the committee of the leaders of the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development, Kenya, 
Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea in the presence of the foreign 
ministers of these states. Today's session will be held at the 
Kenyan Foreign Ministry, while subsequent sessions will be held 
at a different venue which has not yet been announced. 
  The delegation of the Sudanese Government will be headed by 
Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, chairman of the Transitional 
National Assembly, and also includes Dr. 'Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, 
the official spokesman for the government delegation; Dr. Nafi 
Ali Nafi, Agnes Lokudu, Angelo Beda, Dr. 'Abd al-Rahman Ibrahim, 
Mathiang Malwal, Musa Sid Ahmad, Peter Charliman, and 'Abd 
al-Raziq al-Fadl, as well as Sudan's ambassadors to Kenya, Addis 
Ababa, and Uganda. 
  For the rebels, the delegation of Garang's faction will be 
headed by Salva Kiir Mayar Dit, Yusuf Kuwah, Philip Lomoding, 
Stephen Wani, Justin Yaak, and others. 
  The delegation of the United Faction will be headed by 
(Richard Mola) and its members comprise (Dhol Ashwal), Arok 
Thuon Arok, John Luk Jok, Dr. Peter Adhok, and others. 
  The radio correspondent in Nairobi says that the most 
positive indicators pointing to the success of these 
negotiations is the presence of the leaders of the two rebel 
factions, Garang and Machar, at the opening session. This has 
never happened before at any of the earlier rounds of talks. 
Their presence indicates confidence in the negotiations. 
Moreover, Kenya's President Moi, in his speech to the opening 
session, stressed the need for these negotiations to succeed so 
that Africa could demonstrate to the whole world its capacity to 
solve its problems by itself. 
  The current negotiations will have as their starting point 
the point at which the two sides arrived at in the earlier 
rounds at Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Abuja One and Two. It is worth 
noting that the Sudanese delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin 
Khalifah is fully mandated to sign the agreement to be reached.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 21 Mar (KNA) -- The Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] committee of heads 
of state on the Sudan conflict consisting of its chairman, His 
Excellency Daniel arap Moi, president of the Republic of Kenya, 
His Excellency Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, president of the Republic 
of Uganda, His Excellency Meles Zenawi, president of the 
transitional government of Ethiopia and His Excellency Isayas 
Afewerki, president of the state of Eritrea, held its third 
session on 17 March, 1994. 
  The IGADD committee met with Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan 
al-Bashir, president of the Republic of the Sudan and 
subsequently met the leaders of the two Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement/Sudanese People's Liberation Army factions, 
Dr. John Garang and Dr. Riak Machar, and conducted intensive 
consultations within itself and with the parties concerned and 
agreed to launch the IGADD peace talks on the Sudan. 
  The committee and the parties to the conflict agreed that 
pursuant to the mandate given by the meeting off the IGADD 
summit held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 6 and 7 September 1993, 
the negotiations shall take into consideration the previous 
efforts in search of a solution to the conflict, namely talks 
held in August 1989, Addis Ababa, December 1989 in Nairobi, May 
to June 1992 and April to May 1993 in Abuja and May 1993 in 
Nairobi. 
  The committee expressed serious concern at the continued 
human suffering, misery, famine and disease in the war-affected 
areas. It was agreed that the parties to the conflict shall 
allow access to relief agencies to ensure that the relief 
assistance is delivered to the suffering people in those areas. 
  The committee also expressed deep concern that the long 
drawn-out conflict was a threat to peace and security in the 
sub-region. In reference to their stated commitment to the 
IGADD peace initiative including their readiness to immediately 
embark on negotiations, the parties to the conflict agreed to 
send to the peace talks high-level delegations with a full 
mandate to negotiate. The committee called upon the parties 
concerned to the conflict to exercise restraint and desist from 
escalating hostilities, including actions that might jeopardise 
the IGADD initiative, in order to create a conducive atmosphere 
for the conduct of negotiations. 
  The IGADD committee decided that the standing committee of 
ministers of foreign affairs shall conduct the peace 
negotiations under the supervision of the chairman of the IGADD 
committee and directed the standing committee to start the 
negotiating process immediately. 
  The IGADD committee further appealed to the international 
community to continue supporting the initiative. [passage

  [Text] Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih has 
affirmed that Sudan's unity cannot be relinquished and described 
the call for self-determination as an attempt to fragment the 
country's unity. Speaking from the Foreign Ministry's regular 
forum today, Dr. Abu-Salih said the success of the current round 
of negotiations in Nairobi between the government and the 
rebellion basically depended on starting it from the point at 
which the earlier talks had ended. 
  His excellency referred to Sudan's participation in the Arab 
League meeting to be held at foreign minister level in Cairo on 
26 March, saying that the participants would discuss Arab 
security and, for the first time, southern Sudan in the context 
of foreign interference there and attempts to exploit the issue 
for personal interests. Dr. Abu-Salih stressed that there were 
quarters striving to perpetuate the war in the south in the 
service of their interests. His excellency denied reports to 
the effect that Sudan lacked seriousness in solving the southern 
issue. 
  The foreign minister also referred to the visit of an envoy 
of the American President and a U.S. representative to Sudan 
expected by the end of March with the aim of studying the 
efforts being made to establish peace in the country. 
  Ambassador Mahdi Ibrahim, director of the Political 
Department at the Foreign Ministry, also speaking from the 
forum, reported that a Romanian delegation would be visiting the 
country with a view to developing bilateral relations. 
  Ambassador 'Abd-al-Hadi Siddiq, director of the Horn of 
Africa Department at the Foreign Ministry, reported that a 
Sudanese delegation would participate in the seventh African 
conference to be held in Kampala in April.

  [Text] The peace talks between the Sudanese Government and 
the rebel factions will shortly resume this evening in Nairobi. 
The official session this morning was chaired by the Kenyan 
foreign minister in the presence of the foreign ministers of the 
four Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development 
[IGADD] countries. All three negotiating parties, the Sudanese 
Government and the two rebel factions, attended the meeting. 
  It has been resolved that each of the three negotiating 
parties should be represented in the talks by six persons. The 
government delegation stated that the talks would be based on 
previous agendas and start from where the Abuja talks had ended. 
The united faction agrees with the government in this regard, 
but the attitude of Garang's faction towards the previous agenda 
is ambiguous. 
  [Omdurman Republic of Sudan Radio Network in Arabic at 1900 
GMT on 22 March adds: "The peace negotiations between the 
government and the two rebel factions will resume in Nairobi at 
1000 tomorrow with all the delegations continuing to discuss the 
agenda, relief, and other humanitarian issues." 
  ["This evening's session assumed a bilateral form between 
ministers of the IGADD committee and the Sudanese Government 
delegation led by Mr. Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah. During the 
session, the IGADD ministers submitted an agenda derived from 
what had been submitted in the previous peace rounds."]

  [Text] The editor of the African affairs at the 
London-based INDEPENDENT newspaper has affirmed that the plane 
which carries arms being captured at Cyprus was intended to the 
outlaws' movement in southern Sudan, according to what diplomats 
and political analysts state. [words indistinct] outlaws have 
been receiving arms secretly and they think that United States 
and its alliance are the source of these arms. The British 
journalist goes on to say that Washington has offered the green 
light to one of its allies in the area to provide arms to the 
outlaws' movement from the American arms stores following the 
Gulf war. He pointed out that the plane which is now in Cyprus 
is a part of the campaign to overcome the lack of arms in the 
outlaws' hands, adding that the eyewitnesses said they had seen 
a number of trucks carrying arms in the borders.

  [Text] Tunis, 22 Mar (MENA)--A high-level Palestinian 
source has said that a Palestinian-Israeli meeting will be held 
tomorrow night, Wednesday, in Cairo on the sidelines of the 
meeting of the donor countries assisting the Palestinians, which 
will be held in Cairo on Thursday [24 March]. 
  The source said that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon Shahaq will 
cochair the Palestinian-Israeli talks, which will focus on 
Israel's reply to Palestinian demands that the Palestinians 
believe should be met ahead of the resumption of the peace talks. 
  According to the source, the Palestinian requests are: 
  1. Protecting the settlements should be the responsibility 
of the Israeli Government, not of individual settlers. 
  2. Israel should pledge to seek a solution to the tensions 
associated with the settlements. 
  3. Palestinian-Israeli talks should be held to discuss the 
form of transitional international presence in the occupied 
territories. 
  4. A joint Palestinian-Israeli committee should be formed to 
discuss the future of the settlements. 
  The Palestinian source said that the Israelis had given a 
negative reply to these requests but that the intercession of 
Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the Middle East peace process, 
the two meetings he held with the Israeli delegation in Tunisia 
yesterday, and his meeting with President Yasir 'Arafat, brought 
the positions of the two sides closer. The source said that 
Ross has put pressure on the Israelis, making them show a great 
deal of flexibility. 
  The source stated that if the Israelis come with a positive 
and acceptable reply, an important meeting may be held on 
Thursday in Cairo between 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin, and an official statement declaring the 
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations could be 
issued. The source added that everything depends on the outcome 
of the Palestinian-Israeli meeting in Cairo tomorrow.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, March 23 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel are 
moving toward an agreement on Palestinian security in the 
occupied territories that will enable a resumption in autonomy 
talks, a senior PLO official disclosed here late Tuesday [22 
March]. 
  Nabil Sha'th, who headed a Palestinian delegation at 
discussions with Israeli officials on Sunday and Monday in 
Tunis, said the PLO was banking on a positive Israeli response 
to its security demands when the two sides meet again here on 
Thursday. 
  Earlier reports from both Tunis and Israel had said the 
security talks would resume in Cairo on Wednesday. 
  "We can't say we got all that we wanted," Sha'th said of the 
Tunis meetings, "but we are on the way toward an opening that 
will allow for a resumption in the (autonomy) talks and the 
protection of the Palestinians." 
  He added that Israeli and PLO delegates would "probably" 
confer again here on Thursday at a meeting of 22 countries that 
are to finance a Palestinian police force for autonomous 
Palestinian areas of the Israeli-held territories. [passage

  [Text] While contacts, particularly with the PLO, are in 
full swing to resume the PLO-Israeli talks after the issuance of 
UN Security Council Resolution 904, clashes have erupted in the 
West Bank city of Hebron, where the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
was perpetrated. There were only small leaks about yesterday's 
confrontations due to the Israeli military censorship. REUTER 
said the Israeli Army killed a Palestinian woman, who was five 
months pregnant, while she was watching the clashes from the 
window of her house--clashes which resulted in the injury of at 
least five Palestinians. 
  In a telephone interview with our radio, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, 
head of the PLO Information Department, confirmed the death of 
the woman and said about 30 Palestinians were wounded, and 
another three killed during the day. He added that the Israeli 
Army carried out a large-scale offensive in the city of Hebron, 
occupied the children's hospital and Queen 'Alya' Hospital, and 
fired rockets at houses on the pretext of searching for wanted 
persons. Therefore, added 'Abd-Rabbuh, today's Cairo meeting 
between the PLO and Israel will not be held. 
  This Cairo meeting was expected to be held after the failure 
of the Israeli and Palestinian sides in Tunis to agree to the 
resumption of peace talks. The meeting was scheduled to 
concentrate on the issue of protecting Palestinians in the 
occupied territories.

said this morning that there was no intention of suspending the 
Cairo talks. Al-Tibi asserted that the statements made by Yasir 
'Abd- Rabbuh, the head of the PLO's Information Department, were 
misunderstood. Dr. al-Tibi believes that Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh 
merely sought to highlight the obstacles events in Hebron are 
placing in the path of the autonomy talks.

learned that the sides decided on a series of measures to 
protect the Palestinians and increase their sense of security in 
the wake of the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  These are the understandings reached so far: 
  -- An international presence in Hebron, apparently a unit 
made up of a few dozen observers from Norway. 
  -- The establishment of a Palestinian police unit consisting 
of several hundred troops which would deploy in Hebron and would 
be under joint Israeli-Palestinian command. 
  -- Joint patrols to be conducted by Israel, the 
Palestinians, 
and the foreign observers. 
  Palestinian observers in Tunis report on the following 
understandings which have not yet been confirmed by Israel: 
  -- Seven days after the delegations reach a final agreement, 
an armed Palestinian police force will enter the West Bank and 
begin its operations to impose order. 
  -- The trailer neighborhood in the Jericho area will be 
evacuated at once. Three months later, Jewish settlers will be 
evacuated from the heart of Hebron and relocated elsewhere, 
apparently in Qiryat Arba'. Israel has categorically denied 
that it agreed to evacuate the settlers from Hebron. 
  -- All Palestinian deportees will be allowed to return to 
Jericho. 
  -- The PLO leadership will arrive in Jericho a month after 
the deployment of the Palestinian police force. PLO 
administrative personnel and a task force would arrive in the 
area earlier to make all the arrangements for the arrival of the 
leadership. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, in </F>
Tunis, by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd, in Cairo, from the in the 
"Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] We have with us over the phone lines 
between Cairo and Tunis Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
Mr. President, good morning to you and welcome to the Voice of 
the Arabs. 
  ['Arafat] Good morning. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation you 
met with recently propose anything new to you regarding the 
peace process, especially after Security Council Resolution 904 
was issued demanding protection for the Palestinians and 
disarming the Israeli settlers? 
  ['Arafat] The delegation came to Tunis carrying a few 
proposals from the Israeli Government, especially after the 
draft resolution was issued in the Security Council which was 
passed unanimously, despite some reservations expressed by the 
American side on the subject of Jerusalem. The delegation put 
forward the issue of international presence, but as you know, 
unfortunately, their initial idea was to have international 
presence in the form of the International Red Cross. I do not 
want to say too much, but this was completely rejected. I do 
not wish to devalue the Red Cross, but the Red Cross is there 
already. It has always been present in the occupied territories 
and is performing its duties very well. It has submitted many 
reports condemning Israel for violating human rights and the 
Fourth Geneva Convention. There are files and files on this 
matter in Geneva. 
  What we want is a force, a force to protect... [pauses] The 
Security Council resolution stipulates protecting, protecting, 
protecting [preceding word in English], protecting the 
Palestinians. Protecting the Palestinians cannot be done by 
some employees of the International Red Cross. This is why we 
insist on an effective international presence. This 
international presence should be deployed quickly in Hebron. We 
also want a force from the Palestinian police to be deployed in 
Hebron quickly. Of course, the Israeli delegation has so far 
not given us an answer on this topic. We are awaiting the final 
response from it. It is possible that we will get the final 
response from the Israeli Government tomorrow or the day after 
in Cairo on the sidelines of the donor states' meeting which 
will be held in Cairo on Thursday [24 March]. 
  Our stand is clear and frank: We demand the implementation 
of what has been agreed on and stipulated at the Security 
Council. Israel must take actual measures. These measures must 
be clear; they should first and foremost deal with the armed 
settlers and how to disarm them. I can tell you for a fact and 
very precisely that Article No. 2 of Resolution 904 asks Israel, 
the occupying power, to continue to take and implement measures, 
among which are the seizure of weapons with the objective of 
preventing illegitimate acts of violence by the Israeli settlers. 
  The Security Council also calls for implementing measures to 
protect and safeguard the Palestinian civilians throughout the 
occupied Palestinian territories. These include temporary 
international presence, which will be renewed every year like 
all other international forces all over the world. This is a 
matter stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, did the Israeli delegation 
propose the resumption of the peace talks with you? 
  ['Arafat] This will depend on their final reply. Will they 
adhere to the UN Security Council resolution? Will the two 
co-sponsors begin implementing the UN Security Council 
resolution? Will the Israelis adopt effective measures to ensure 
the non-repetition of new massacres, new frictions, and new 
massacres? Therefore, we are awaiting their answer on Thursday, 
God willing. We hope they will bring answers to these questions. 
In addition, arrests of our people are continuing. They say 
they have released 900 detainees. But in the meantime they have 
arrested about 1,500 people in the past three weeks. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You also met with Dennis Ross, the U.S. 
coordinator of the peace process. Did you ask him to see to it 
that the UN Security Council 904 is turned into real action at 
the basic level? Did he propose to you anything from the U.S. 
Administration for the protection of the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories and for the resumption of the peace talks? 
  ['Arafat] In these talks we discussed how to implement the 
UN Security Council resolution. We received some positive 
replies upon which, we can say, we can build. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] What are these replies? 
  ['Arafat] International protection, for example. We support 
this international protection. It is true that its form and 
size have not been fully determined between us and the Israelis. 
However, they agree on international protection and on the 
implementation of UN Security Council 904 and the others 
measures that must be taken at the basic level. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Did the U.S. coordinator propose new ideas 
regarding this protection? 
  ['Arafat] He proposed many things. I prefer not to mention 
them until full measures are formulated, which our people will 
see at the basic level and which will reassure them. These 
measures will ensure their security and protection. These are 
basic things for us. These measures will also ensure the safety 
and security of our Islamic and Christian holy shrines. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] If the Israeli reply is not positive in light 
of these developments, how do you view the peace process in the 
coming phase? 
  ['Arafat] We should not anticipate events. We are 
optimistic. This issue is no longer a Palestinian-Israeli issue. 
After the UN Security Council resolution, it has become the 
responsibility of the two cosponors to implement this 
resolution. We must wait and see how this implementation will 
take place. We should not anticipate events. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Was Resolution 904 in harmony with the wishes 
of the Palestinian people at this phase? 
  ['Arafat] Of course not. Do you think that any state can 
issue any Security Council resolution it wants? We are not a 
superpower. We, plus the Arab effort, the Islamic effort, the 
nonaligned effort, and our friends' efforts, were barely able to 
win this resolution. Nevertheless, as you have seen, the word 
Jerusalem turned the world upside down. There were attempts 
that lasted for weeks to persuade us to omit the world 
Jerusalem. Nobody can omit Jerusalem, neither from our 
conscience nor from our decisions. Whoever wants to veto, let 
him veto. Therefore, this was our position. The resolution was 
delayed because of this for weeks. The resolution was issued. 
The resolution in itself was not bad. I cannot say we took 
everything we wanted. However, the resolution was not bad. The 
most important thing in it is the world consensus. The United 
Nations is now responsible for this resolution through the two 
cosponsors, namely the Russian Federation and the United States. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Does the Israeli and U.S. rejection of 
proposals made by Russia recently, that a new international 
conference for peace in the Middle East along the Madrid 
conference lines take place, mean that the Russian role has 
started to diminish, or that Russia is also attempting to exert 
some pressure on these negotiations? What could Russia propose 
in the next stage? 
  ['Arafat] First of all, you should not forget that Russia is 
one of the cosponsors of the Madrid peace process. At that 
time, it was the Soviet Union and then it became the Russian 
Federation. The Security Council resolution asks the cosponsors 
of the conference, the Russian Federation and the United States, 
to implement the aforementioned resolutions. Therefore, their 
efforts are stipulated in the resolution. Undoubtedly, we 
notice good and positive activity from Russia, and we welcome 
this Russian activity. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, the Israeli housing minister 
says that he is confident that negotiations between the 
Palestinians and Israelis will resume soon despite the 
difficulties. Where did the Israeli housing minister get his 
optimism, given the current obstacles? 
  ['Arafat] [words indistinct] This minister, along with 
eight other ministers, that is, half the Israeli cabinet, 
support taking quick measures against the settlers in Hebron, 
for example. Therefore, I told the delegation that came to visit 
me here that half their cabinet is against the activities of the 
settlers. It is not possible to allow such belligerence to 
continue these days in cooperation with some political parties 
in Israel. The whole world sees on their television sets what 
the Israeli military patrols and the armed settlers are doing. 
  Today in Hebron, there was a tragedy. The houses of 
Palestinians are being shelled with rockets in southern Hebron 
under the pretext that there are two outlaws being chased. For 
the sake of two people we destroy the whole town. This prompts 
us to affirm that what is happening is collusion between the 
Army and the armed settlers. Hebron has not yet bandaged its 
wounds. It is still bleeding. And they go ahead and start this 
fierce battle in it. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Do you believe that given the situation now, 
there is need for a meeting between you and Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to resolve all these problems? 
  ['Arafat] I would like to meet with him, but we do not want 
a meeting like the past ones in which we did not reach any 
solutions. Are we supposed to add fuel to the fire? I am ready 
to meet him, but a final decision should be made to accurately 
and honestly implement what was agreed on and signed in the 
White House in September of last year, and recently the Security 
Council resolution that was issued a couple of days ago. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Mr. President, how do you view the Egyptian 
effort now at this stage to help set the Palestinian people on 
the practical road to establishing their entity? 
  ['Arafat] I wish to thank my brother Husni Mubarak for his 
patience with us and his concerted efforts, as well as the 
efforts of his brothers in the Egyptian Government, including 
the Foreign Ministry efforts and those of Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa. We cannot forget them. Our people are recording these 
efforts with great love and appreciation, and we cannot forget 
such efforts. It is not strange for Egypt to do this. The 
relationship that links Egypt with Palestine is not a 
superficial relationship. No. It is a strong relationship 
which goes back through the ages historically, geographically, 
politically, and religiously, with Jerusalem, the third holiest 
Islamic shrine, the Prophet's destination in his night journey 
from Mecca, and the cradle of Christ. 
  Therefore, once again, I thank President Mubarak and my 
brothers in Egypt for their efforts on all levels. My people 
will never forget their stands. Once again, I thank you from 
the bottom of my heart. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Finally, Palestinian President 'Arafat, what 
do you wish to tell the steadfast Palestinian people in the 
occupied Arab territories over the Voice of the Arabs? 
  ['Arafat] If God helps you, nobody can overcome you [Koranic 
verse]. I wish to tell my people, be patient and trust in God. 
I know that our people are a great people who cannot be shaken 
by a conspiracy, nor can their determination, patience, belief, 
or jihad be affected by a massacre. In fact, massacres only 
increase their determination, strength, and persistence to 
continue along their path. The Palestinian people have been 
established on the political and geographic map of the region. 
No one can reject these Palestinian people or the crucial 
factor they constitute in the Middle East peace equation. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Dear brothers, at the end of this dialogue, we 
thank you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who was with 
us over the telephone lines between Cairo and Tunis. Thank you 
Mr. President. 
  ['Arafat] Thank you.

  [Excerpts] PLO leaders in the Gaza Strip and the Peace Now 
movement this morning issued a joint statement in which they 
called for bringing forward the implementation of the withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho. Peace Now activists also met with Fatah 
leaders in Hebron for the first time since the massacre in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [El'azar] Dozens of Fatah members from 
Hebron tensely waited for the Peace Now activists in Bayt Jala, 
south of Jerusalem. Contacts between Fatah's leadership in 
Hebron and the Israeli peace camp were ruptured in the aftermath 
of the massacre. However, Peace Now leaders arrived at the 
meeting location today with a message of dialogue. Mustafa 
al-Natshah, the former mayor of Hebron, told them: The desire 
for peace has survived the massacre. 
  [Al-Natshah, in English] Nobody says I don't want peace. 
But, in order to have a just peace and a long-lasting one you 
need to have the ground paved for this peace. Settlements, 
settlers, and peace are contradictions. 
  [El'azar translates the above and continues] Come back to 
the negotiating table and cooperate with the state commission of 
inquiry, Peace Now activists asked the Palestinians. Gavri 
Bar-Gil, Peace Now's secretary general, said the demand to 
eliminate the settlements was definitely justified. [passage 
omitted] 
  The sides parted without reaching any agreement. Behind the 
scenes, however, Peace Now today scored an achievement. In a 
closed meeting held this morning in the PLO's offices in Gaza, 
Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, the PLO coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said 
that the Palestinians were prepared to return to the negotiating 
table. The Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip and Peace Now 
issued a joint statement proposing to bring forward the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Amir Hay] </F>
  [Excerpts] For the first time since the Madrid conference, 
the representatives of all the political factions in Hebron, 
including Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad, 
held a joint news conference. They protested the steps taken by 
Israel in the wake of the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs 
and called on 'Arafat to quit the peace talks immediately. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Hebron massacre has unified all the political factions 
in 
Hebron in their demand to station an international protection 
force in the territories and to evacuate all the Jewish settlers 
from Hebron. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, the deputy chairman of the Palestinian 
delegation, said that despite the pain felt over the Hebron 
massacre, the Palestinians should continue the negotiations with 
Israel. 'Urayqat's remarks elicited a furious reaction from the 
audience. [passage omitted] 
  The steps taken by Israel immediately after the Hebron 
massacre, such as the establishment of the Shamgar Commission, 
are seen here as a predetermined farce. The only way to resolve 
the crisis, the participants said, is to redefine the concept of 
security in the territories so that it will cease to be the 
exclusive monopoly of the Jews.

  [Excerpts] George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine [PFLP] has assumed responsibility for the terrorist 
attack on a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret yesterday. Two 
Israeli citizens were injured in the attack. Here is a report 
by our correspondent in the territories, Golan Yokhpaz: 
  A leaflet signed by PFLP activists and in which the 
organization assumes responsibility for the terrorist attack on 
a bus near the settlement of 'Ateret, north of Jerusalem, was 
disseminated in Ramallah this morning. This is the first 
operation in the framework of settling scores between the 
Palestinian people and the Zionists following the massacre in 
the Cave of the Patriarchs, the PFLP activists state in their 
leaflet. Our forces will not cease their activities until a 
just and comprehensive solution has been found to the 
Palestinian problem and until a Palestinian state with holy 
Jerusalem as its capital has been founded. The leaflet goes on 
to say that the attack was carried out by two PFLP fighters who 
succeeded in escaping. [passage omitted] 
  Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorists were 
arrested this morning several hundred meters north of the Erez 
checkpoint. Armed with a knife, the two managed to make their 
way out of the Gaza Strip without permits to enter Israel. They 
planned to carry out a terrorist attack in Israel. They were 
carrying a leaflet signed by Hamas and a copy of the Koran.

  [Excerpt] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed 
responsibility for the attack Monday [21 March] night near the 
settlement of 'Ateret north of Ramallah. 
  A leaflet distributed yesterday in the Gaza Strip, Ramallah, 
and East Jerusalem noted that the attack near Bi'r Zayt in which 
five settlers were wounded had been perpetrated by 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam troops. 
  The leaflet added that this was "the beginning of the 
implementation of the plan to expel the settlers from all the 
territories," as had been promised in a previous leaflet in 
which the settlers were given an ultimatum to leave by 15 March. 
The authors contend that this ultimatum had already caused 
several families to leave Qiryat Arba'. However, the leaflet 
noted, Hamas does not consider this sufficient "and will 
continue to strike until the last settler leaves." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Military communique read by PFLP-GC spokesman on 22 March] </F>
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  To avenge the continuing Zionist crimes in Palestine; in 
reply to the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre; to vindicate the 
souls of our people's martyrs; to confirm that direct clashes 
with enemy troops are the way to defeat the occupation troops 
and the Zionist expansionist scheme; because the heroic 
mujahidin and revolutionaries believe armed struggle is the only 
possible way to liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab 
territories and defeat the liquidatory plan promoted by the 
Tunis-headquartered PLO leadership as enshrined in the 
Gaza-Jericho accord; and to expose the resolutions of the UN 
Security Council, which has turned into a pliable tool in the 
hands of the United States and the Zionist enemy, one of our 
units operating behind enemy lines laid an ambush for enemy 
patrols in the al-'Ayshiyah-al-Rayhan mountainous area. 
  At 1200 on Monday, 21 March 1994, our heroic fighters opened 
fire on a Zionist patrol. As usual, the enemy attempted to 
underestimate its losses. However, it later admitted that two 
of its soldiers were killed. 
  In view of the immense losses sustained by the enemy, the 
Zionist aggression troops, in cooperation with the agent Lahd 
troops, poured their terrorist firepower on the heads of 
Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, targeting schools, markets, 
and residential neighborhoods. 
  While underscoring the importance of stepping up armed 
struggle, and while persisting with this jihad course, we, in 
the PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command], believe the best reply to the 
enemy's massacres; that is, protecting our people against its 
terrorism, is only achievable when the fire of the blessed 
intifadah is fuelled, and when the course of jihad and armed 
struggle is nurtured. 
  We would like to address the following questions to all 
those 
engaged in bargaining: What do you call the current shelling 
and killing of civilians? Is not the shelling of al-Nabatiyah, 
Sidon, and 'Ayn al-Hulwah the epitome of terrorism? 
  Our open war against the Zionist enemy and the mujahidin 
attacks are the resistance approach our people have chosen as a 
way to liberate land and man. 
  We will apprise you of any new developments or details. 
  It is a revolution until the liberation of land and man. 
  [Signed] The PFLP-GC 
  [Dated] 22 March 1994

  [Text] Finally, 25 days after a terrible massacre took 
place at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque, the Security Council 
issued its Resolution No. 904. This will be added to a large 
record containing scores and even hundreds of resolutions that 
tell the history of the Palestine question, the most tragic 
event in human history, in which right and injustice fiercely 
conflict with each other. Right has nothing except shouts of 
justice and legitimacy, while injustice has a sword and the 
ability to kill and can create a river of blood and tears and a 
lot of agony. The massacre that occurred at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque is not the first and it will not be the last. 
  At last, the resolution, which consists of a preamble and 
five clauses, was issued. During its lengthy and difficult 
delivery, many things happened, foremost of which is the 
continued killing of Palestinians, not only at the hands of the 
settlers, but also at the hands of the Israeli Army forces 
themselves. This added to the atmosphere of procrastination, 
pressure, and threat the United States is exercising in its 
capacity as the leader of the world and the major sponsor of the 
peace process. 
  As a result, the United States refused to vote on two very 
important clauses. The first clause is mentioned in the 
preamble. It stipulates the need to provide protection for our 
Palestinian people. The second clause stipulates Israeli 
withdrawal from the territories Israel occupied in June 1979, 
including Jerusalem. 
  O brothers, the refusal of the United States to vote on 
these 
two clauses has serious implications, foremost of which is the 
U.S. retreat from its previous positions, decisions, and 
assurances regarding the Palestine question and the core of the 
conflict. It is a retreat from the issue of land, which is the 
subject of the conflict and from the Palestinian people's 
security that is the main element in this conflict. 
  Taking the Israeli viewpoint, it becomes clear that Israel 
is trying to tell us: We slaughter you. We protect you. You 
have no choice. As for the U.S. viewpoint, which is identical 
to this, it is telling us: You have negotiations ahead of you. 
Everything is decided at the negotiating table, even your life 
itself. 
  This is the most heinous form of injustice. It is the 
quarrelsomeness of the idiot force that leaves no room for 
right. It is a flagrant injustice that tells us: See you at the 
next massacre. 
  In this terrible context, the Palestine question, also known 
as the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Middle East issue, will 
continue to be watered with its own blood and fed from its great 
pain, and to glow above and beneath ashes as a result of this 
blatant injustice, overall despair, and this full bias in 
accordance with which the United States moves to protect the 
Israeli killer from the efforts he exerted in killing the 
Palestinian victim. God is great, the earth was shaken, and the 
heavens moved as a result of this grave injustice, the tyranny 
of force, and the murder of peace on the land of peace. 
  However, brothers, we know injustice is the spark of every 
revolution, the tyranny of force is the beginning of every 
explosion, and the disdain of the blood of innocent people is 
the curse no one will escape. And soon will the unjust 
assailants know what vicissitudes their affairs will take. 
[Koranic verse] 
  We go back to politics and say: Will UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 904 be turned into tangible and concrete 
measures? Will the settlers leave Hebron? Will the criminal 
settlers be disarmed? Will the vanguards of the UN protection 
force arrive in the Palestinian land? This is an urgent time 
for these questions, especially since the U.S. Administration 
did not approve the passing of the UN Security Council 
resolution on the massacre until after it obtained assurances 
from the Arab cordon states to resume the negotiations in April. 
This requires a maximum degree of Arab awareness, caution, and 
coordination, which we hope will be achieved during the meeting 
the Arab cordon states will hold soon on the foreign ministers' 
level. 
  Brothers, still, we should say that every Palestinian wound, 
regardless of how painful it is, can be endured by our great 
struggler people if this wound illuminates our nation's 
conscience, and gives it a new incentive to rise above its 
internal differences, wounds, and transient contradictions. We 
wholeheartedly hope that all this will be achieved because the 
alternative is the recurrence of the tragedy. The nation that 
disdains its people's blood encourages others to disdain it. It 
is a revolution until victory!

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "If Only It Used the Veto"] </F>
  [Text] Three weeks after the Hebron massacre, the UN 
Security Council has issued a resolution condemning it and 
urging international protection for the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories in accordance with the clauses of the 
Fourth Geneva convention. Although the United States did not 
use the veto against the resolution, it did something worse by 
opposing the consolidation of Palestinian identity in the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip, with Jerusalem as an integral part of 
it. 
  It is difficult for us to see this U.S. position as anything 
but negative, especially as the Arabs -- individually and 
collectively -- offered numerous concessions to make the peace 
process sponsored by Washington a success. 
  The danger in the U.S. abstention from voting lies not only 
in the complete bias toward Israel and its crimes in the 
occupied territories, but in the credibility of the peace 
process sponsored by it in its early and final stages. 
  If the United States does not believe that the occupied 
territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are Palestinian 
territory, this means it espouses the Israeli position, which 
regards them as disputed territories -- which conflicts with all 
international charters and laws and the letters of guarantees 
and assurances the U.S. Administration sent to the parties 
concerned and on the basis of which it participated in the 
Madrid peace conference. 
  As for the U.S. abstention from considering Jerusalem an 
integral part of the occupied Arab territories, it can only be 
interpreted in one way: There is no guarantee of the inclusion 
of this fundamental issue on the agenda of the final phase of 
negotiations. And even if it is included, it might not 
encounter U.S. support. 
  This U.S. position put all Arabs, not just the Palestinians, 
in a very embarrassing position. Because the Arabism of the 
land has become threatened and the future of sovereignty over 
Jerusalem has become more vague. 
  What arouses astonishment and amazement is some Arab 
parties' 
rush to respond to the "telephone" demand by the U.S. to return 
to the negotiations, without having obtained specific 
clarifications to determine the true U.S. position after the 
recent voting, especially with regard to the identity of 
Jerusalem. 
  More than one Israeli newspaper has quoted U.S. President 
Bill Clinton as calling Jerusalem the unified capital of Israel. 
We were surprised by some Arab newspapers' rush to publish a 
denial of these remarks by U.S. officials who volunteered to 
make this denial to save the Clinton administration among Arab 
circles. 
  The abstention of the U.S. representative to the Security 
Council from the vote on considering Jerusalem part of the 
occupied territories justifies Israeli press reports about 
President Clinton's position on Jerusalem and his view of its 
future -- a dishonorable situation for the Arabs at any rate. 
  And if Dr. Barukh Goldstein and those who participated with 
him in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron have revealed 
serious loopholes in the declaration of principles agreement 
vis-a-vis the Palestinians' security in the occupied 
territories, the recent voting in the UN Security Council has 
revealed bigger loopholes in the U.S. position on fundamental 
issues -- loopholes that could kill the current peace process in 
all its early and final stages. 
  All the calamities afflicting the Arabs are the result of 
the 
lack of coordination among the parties concerned and the 
complete submission to U.S. policies in the region, beginning 
with the embargo imposed on Iraq through to the sanctions 
imposed on Libya and the swift response to the appeals to return 
to the negotiating table without any conditions or guarantees. 
  It is regrettable that the Hebron massacre and the 
subsequent 
smaller massacres, which occurred in confrontations between Arab 
demonstrators and Israelis armed to the teeth, should take place 
and yet we hear no Arab call to convene an Arab League meeting 
at any level to discuss the matter and agree on a unified plan 
to raise the issue in international forums.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Arab Coordination Has Become a Strategic </F>
Necessity"] 
  [Text] Since the signing of the interim agreement between 
the PLO and Israel on 13 September, a reduction has been 
observed in the levels of coordination and consultation among 
the Arab parties participating in the peace process. Sometimes 
one has even noticed the disappearance of those contacts and 
coordination efforts, so much so that it has been left to 
coincidence and unscheduled occasions to provide some sort of 
accidental contact between the Arab parties to at least maintain 
the appearance of solidarity. 
  Following the Hebron massacre, bilateral and multilateral 
talks were suspended on all tracks. There was a conviction or 
almost agreement that the talks would not be resumed until the 
UN Security Council issues a resolution on the massacre. No 
sooner was that resolution issued than it was announced in 
Washington, not in the Arab capitals concerned, that the 
resumption of the talks was imminent. 
  Thus, inter-Arab contacts have become subject to emergency 
conditions, whereas those contacts were and remain an important 
card in the hands of Arab negotiators. Presumably, if the Arab 
side had known how to use this card, the Arab negotiating 
position would have improved a great deal. Perhaps, it would 
have been possible to avoid many of the predicaments that befell 
the Arab parties due to lack of consultation and coordination 
between them. 
  Now, with the retreats in the negotiating process on the 
various Arab tracks, without exception, and the successes 
achieved by the Israeli side due to its special and excellent 
relationship with its U.S. partner, illustrated by the recent 
U.S. abstention on a paragraph in Resolution 904 that considered 
Jerusalem to be part of the occupied territories, it seems that 
the logical solution for the Arab parties is to leave the closed 
regional circles and return to dealing jointly with the sole 
Arab cause. The Israeli and U.S. sides are not only trying to 
separate this cause, but also to exploit the division of the 
Arab negotiating tracks as a game to which they can resort 
whenever they want to exert pressure with the aim of obtaining 
more Arab concessions on this or that track. 
  The Hebron massacre repercussions and the dangerous signals 
that accompanied the issuance of the Security Council resolution 
require the acceleration of meetings and serious contacts among 
the Arab parties concerned, because now the cause has become 
above narrow regional differences and interpretations. The 
dimensions of the cause have actually extended to include the 
superior Arab strategic interest, which was and will remain 
above every transitory difference and interpretation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Syrian `Veto' on PLO Torpedoes </F>
Cordon States Meetings"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Highly placed Jordanian 
sources have stated that the formula governing the meetings of 
the Arab cordon states, namely Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, 
and the PLO, probably no longer exists and no coordination 
meetings are expected to be held in the near future. 
  The sources added that Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' 
had stated frankly at Amman airport on his latest visit that the 
PLO had ruled itself out of all coordination frameworks when it 
signed the Oslo agreement in Washington last September. 
  The sources expected the five-party cordon states formula to 
be replaced by coordination meetings between Jordan, Syria, and 
Lebanon. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, who has resigned from the PLO 
Executive 
Committee, also ruled out the possibility of a cordon states 
meeting in the near future. In an interview with AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT he said that "such meetings came to a halt when the PLO 
leadership solitarily signed the Oslo agreement, which made 
Damascus emphatically object to the PLO's presence [at 
coordination meetings]. [no closing quotation mark] 
  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department, tried 
unsuccessfully to soften the Syrian position and to call for a 
coordination meeting attended by the five parties. The valid 
formula now is one of consultation between the three parties. 
That was clear when President Hafiz al-Asad, in his 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton after the Security 
Council passed its resolution 904, said that Syria, Jordan, and 
Lebanon had agreed to resume the negotiations with Israel. 
  Political observers in Amman point out that Cairo is no 
longer very enthusiastic for a coordination meeting of the 
Cordon States and that at present it gives priority to the 
implementation of the PLO-Israel Cairo agreement, over which 
Cairo had a diplomatic clash with Washington when President 
Clington called for the transfer of the venue of the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to Washington. That 
disagreement was resolved on the basis that the final agreement 
between the two sides would be signed in Cairo.

polling stations; I also talked to governors and to the Justice

with the high turnout and the calm that prevailed over the 
elections. 
  In Kairouan, I talked to the local opposition leaders, who 
were fighting the elections there and, as far as I am concerned, 
the opposition was satisfied with the progress of the elections.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Breach of Promise .... Iran's </F>
Deposition"] 
  [Text] Pakistan's decision to not pursue a vote on its 
resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 9 
March regarding the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir 
was at the request of the friendly countries of Iran and China. 
Iran assured Pakistan that India would permit a delegation of 
the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] member countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir so as to assess the human rights 
violations there. The Pakistani delegation's spokesman cited 
the Indian pledge as the reason for the decision to not seek a 
vote on the resolution. On the very next day after the 
deferment of the resolution, India's Minister of State for 
External Affairs Salman Khurshid and External Affairs Minister 
Dinesh Singh claimed that India had made no commitment to 
provide an opportunity to the delegation of Islamic countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir and that Pakistan unconditionally 
deferred the vote on the resolution. 
  These statements by the Indian authorities have badly 
affected the position of Pakistan, as the Indian external 
affairs minister had rejected Pakistan's assertions. At this 
juncture, political and media circles in Pakistan urged the 
government to present a correct picture of the situation and say 
whether India had really made any such commitment. In response 
to this, Foreign Secretary Shahryar Khan said Pakistan has 
documentary evidence of India's promise to let the ICO 
delegation visit occupied Kashmir. Now, on arrival at 
Islamabad, Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
special emissary and Deputy Foreign Minister Ala-ed-Din 
Borujerdi has said in categorical terms that India promised Iran 
and China that it would allow envoys from Islamic countries to 
visit occupied Kashmir. The categorical announcement of the 
Iranian guest is enough to make it clear that Pakistan's 
assertion is right and that of India is wrong. 
  Definitely, Iran and China would have been surprised and 
anguished over the Indian statements, but certainly no one in 
Pakistan would be surprised about the Indian attitude. We are 
quite familiar with India's record and have experienced its 
numerous silly tricks. India's tendency has always been to make 
promises when it comes under pressure on any problem, but when 
it is relieved of that pressure, it fudges on the promises. We 
experienced two instances of this, in 1948-49 and in 1962. 
Coming under pressure from mojahedin in 1948-49, the Indian 
Government promised to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir and 
confirmed this in international fora. Soon after that, India 
reneged on that promise. When India had to embrace defeat at 
every step during its war with China in 1962 on the border 
question, it expressed its readiness to hold talks with Pakistan 
on the Kashmir issue and also held six rounds of foreign 
minister-level talks under international pressure. As far as 
the outcome of the talks are concerned, India was not prepared 
to budge from its stubborn posture. The war on the border 
question was over by then and India was out of danger. 
  When Pakistan moved a resolution on the Kashmir issue at 
the UN General Assembly a few months ago, India, through the 
mediation of mutual friends, extended an invitation to Pakistan 
for talks on the Kashmir situation on the condition that 
Pakistan withdraw its resolution. Pakistan accepted the offer 
so as to make it clear to the world that it never refuses to 
hold talks. As a result, bilateral talks were held at the 
beginning of January. Even then, India maintained its unpleasant 
tradition and refused to adopt any reasonable position. 
Therefore, Pakistan was constrained to move its resolution at 
the UN Human Rights Commission. 
  The latest announcement of Ala-ed-Din Borujerdi has once 
again revealed India's falsehood and made it clear that it does 
not honor pledges made at international fora. This statement by 
the Iranian deputy foreign minister has once again put the ball 
in India's court, and now India should either allow the ICO 
delegation to visit Kashmir or become a liar before Iran and 
China in particular and the international community in general. 
India also made the flamboyant claim that it does not want to 
conceal the situation in occupied Kashmir from the eyes of the 
world, and has granted permission to visit to the ambassadors of 
European countries first and to those of neutral countries 
thereafter. The foreign diplomats who visited the state, 
however, while considering the Indian claim regarding the 
situation in occupied Kashmir, have said that they were not 
allowed to tour the state freely. The 10 envoys of the 
delegation were virtual prisoners in the hands of the Indian 
administration. They were not allowed to meet people freely nor 
were they allowed access to the areas of their choice. Those 
who wanted to meet the envoys were not allowed to enter the 
Government Guest House. The diplomats said that wherever they 
went they encountered strong official security, and those who 
met them said without mincing words that they do not want to 
stay with India and that they either want total independence or 
annexation to Pakistan. This account of the diplomats after 
their visit makes it clear that a powerful struggle continues in 
Kashmir for escape from the bondage of India, and India is not 
willing to permit foreign observers to take stock of the 
situation there. If the internal situation bars India from 
permitting the ICO delegation to review the situation in the 
state despite its latest pledge, the people of Pakistan can 
fully understand it. It is the duty of the Government of 
Pakistan to continuously raise the Kashmir issue at 
international fora and follow India closely. It is the moral 
responsibility of Iran and China to ask India to let the ICO 
delegation visit the state as promised. To a great extent, the 
statement of the Iranian deputy foreign minister has disproved 
the propaganda by the opposition in Pakistan against the 
government's deferment of the resolution.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he continues to 
have reservations about the situation in Hebron, where 120,000 
Arabs remain under curfew because of 415 settlers. However, he 
said, the question of whether or not to continue the closure 
hinged solely on security considerations and the need to prevent 
any Jewish bloodshed. 
  Rabin told the Labor Knesset faction that the government 
would reach a decision regarding the evacuation of the Jewish 
settlers from central Hebron on the basis of security 
considerations, not public opinion polls. Rabin added that the 
support voiced by right-wing elements for Dr. Goldstein's crime 
had been widely reported in the international media. Today, Mr. 
Rabin said, we do not look as nice as we thought in the eyes of 
the world. The prime minister stressed that Israel had no other 
negotiating partner among the Palestinians except Yasir 'Arafat 
and the PLO. 
  As for the situation in Lebanon, Prime Minister Rabin said 
that yesterday's ambush in the security zone was laid by members 
of Ahmad Jibril's PFLP-GC [Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command] and not by the Hizballah. The 
identity of those who launched the katyusha rockets that landed 
in the western Galilee yesterday, however, remained unknown. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir added that during the session, 
it 
was reported that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] was currently 
completing its plans for new security arrangements in Hebron and 
in the Cave of the Patriarchs. When these plans are completed 
they will brought before the political echelon for approval. 
One of the aims is to prevent Jewish extremists in Hebron and 
Qiryat Arba' from harassing Arabs, as has been the case in the 
past.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by MBC </F>
Correspondent Mahir Shalabi on 22 March; place not 
given--recorded, in English with superimposed Arabic translation] 
  [Text] [Shalabi] The Palestinians in Tunis say that your 
delegation, which visited Tunis recently, did not make any new 
proposals that could help the resumption of negotiations. 
  [Peres] I am not sure that they have said something like 
this. I hope the talks will resume. This is a beginning, and we 
are all in a difficult situation. But I believe that through a 
common effort we can continue the negotiations and establish a 
new reality. 
  [Shalabi] The Palestinians are saying that the Israelis are 
proposing setting up a security belt around settlements in 
Hebron instead of finding another solution. 
  [Peres] I do not think so. I believe that the Israeli 
delegation said that while negotiating over the measures we need 
to guarantee the security of all citizens--Arabs and Jews--and 
we are ready to hold talks with the PLO over this matter. 
However, the issue of the settlers is a purely Israeli matter. 
This matter is the responsibility of the Israeli Government and 
it will make the appropriate decision. 
  [Shalabi] In your opinion, what are the factors that will 
help the resumption of the negotiations? 
  [Peres] I believe that we need to do two things. The first 
is to take measures to provide security for everyone in Hebron. 
We will take such measures. The second thing is to quickly 
conclude negotiations over Gaza and Jericho in a very short 
period of time. Thus, we would be showing the Palestinians and 
ourselves a new reality, not only a new declaration. I hope 
that within a few weeks the Palestinians' autonomy in Gaza and 
Jericho will be a reality. 
  [Shalabi] Do you think that if you reach an agreement with 
the PLO you will be able to implement it before 13 April? 
  [Peres] It all depends on when we start negotiations because 
if we want to know when they will end, we need to know when they 
will begin. However, it is not far away from that date. At any 
rate, the talks will resume tomorrow.

  [Text] The leaders of the opposition factions have 
requested to meet with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. They wish 
to discuss jointly agreed-upon steps to guarantee the safety and 
well-being of the Jewish settlers in Hebron in an attempt to 
prevent a rift among the Israeli public. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu even proposed that Rabin 
join the opposition factions in agreeing on a practical plan to 
protect the residents of Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip.

  [Text] Israel's Chief Rabbi Baqshi Doron has decreed that 
the entry of Muslims to the Temple Mount should be prevented. 
The rabbi also ruled that Muslim tourism to the site should not 
be encouraged. 
  Our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld reports that the 
halakhic 
edict stated that Muslim tourists endangered the existence of 
the Jewish people in their country. 
  Meanwhile, Waqf officials in Jerusalem said they would 
continue to bar Israelis and tourists from entering the Temple 
Mount. Israel Police, on the other hand, said that it was 
preventing the entry of Israelis and tourists out of operational 
considerations. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that 
representatives from the police and the Jerusalem Municipality 
met yesterday with Waqf officials on the matter. 
  [Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 23 March in a page 
14 
report by Shlomo Naqdimon reports that "Former Chief Rabbi 
Shlomo Goren yesterday said that `Masada could repeat itself in 
Hebron.'" The paper notes that Rabbi Goren "warned that the 
evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron would end in 
bloodshed." Goren added that "the Jews in Hebron must hang on 
by their nails. They must on no account agree to be evacuated. 
I am hereby declaring that I will stand at their side when this 
happens. I am ready to give my life together with them and to 
resist any attempt to evacuate them." YEDI'OT AHARONOT goes on 
to explain that "in Masada, the defenders of the Jewish fortress 
preferred to commit mass suicide rather than surrender to the 
Roman conqueror."]

<F P=106> [Report by Nicole Krau] </F>
  [Excerpts] Last Sunday [13 March], when the decision to 
define all right-wing movements as terror organizations was 
announced, Kakh's Tel Aviv branch closed down. The branch had 
been located on Hanegev Street in the old Central Bus Station in 
the past 12 years, having moved there from Dizengoff. "We seem 
to be closed," one of the movement's leading figures says, "but 
in practice, the branch's entire activity has been moved to a 
safe apartment in downtown Tel Aviv, in which an activist family 
lives. The location of the branch will be changed occasionally 
to prevent exposure by the security forces." 
  The activist's remarks reveal that Kakh activists use five 
safe apartments in the Tel Aviv area. The apartments are 
situated mainly in south Tel Aviv, Hatiqva neighborhood, Bat 
Yam, and Ramat 'Amidar in Ramat Gan. The activist adds that the 
movement has hundreds of activists and supporters in the Dan 
District. According to Kakh activists, Kakh and EYAL [Irgun 
Yehudi Lohem] leaders and the heads of Kahana Hay have recently 
discussed consolidation. [passage omitted] 
  One of the Kakh leaders in the Dan District has said that 
the 
movement would suspend its activities until the High Court of 
Justice rules on the movement's appeal against the orders 
outlawing it. They plan later "to start taking care of the Arab 
problem in Yafo." At first they will distribute in Yafo 
leaflets demanding that the Arab residents leave the city, and 
later they will proceed to damage property. "We will burn their 
cars and houses, but we will not attack people for the time 
being," he said. 
  In addition, the Kakh people plan to act against the 
moderate 
right wing and the left-wing organizations in the city and to 
attack Meretz centers and the Labor building. The activist says 
that reporters, who attack the movement in media, will receive 
life threats. 
  According to Kakh activists, they expect to receive weapons 
soon. They maintain that the weapons will be smuggled in by 
movement activists who are due to immigrate to Israel from the 
United States -- people whose political views are unknown to the 
security services. "We are defined as a terrorist organization, 
and as such, we have nothing to lose. We feel as if we were 
ETZEL and LEHI [pre-state underground organizations], and we 
will use their methods in our operations," the activist sums up. 
The police say they have not as yet reorganized their approach 
to the Kakh personnel. For now, the issue will be addressed by 
the National Unit for Serious Crimes Investigation.

  [Text] The Shamgar Commission today heard testimony from 
Palestinians who were praying in the Cave of the Patriarchs at 
the time of the massacre. Three of them claimed that they had 
heard shots fired from more than one direction, and suggested 
that Barukh Goldstein did not carry out the killings by himself. 
One of them said he heard the sound of hand grenades, as well 
as automatic gunfire. A fourth witness said soldiers prevented 
people from leaving the cave after the massacre and even raised 
their weapons, but the worshipers ignored them and went on their 
way.

attempt to locate a second terrorist. 
  One of the men was seriously wounded and taken to the Soroka

  [Text] Numerous serious incidents took place in the 
territories today. Palestinian sources reported that dozens of 
people were wounded. At several locations, including Hebron, 
the clashes took place when the Army removed the curfew for 
several hours in order to permit local residents to buy 
provisions and youths began hurling rocks at the soldiers. 
  A pregnant woman was apparently killed by IDF [Israel 
Defense 
Forces] gunfire in Hebron. The IDF is investigating the 
circumstances of the incident. A girl from the Jabalyah refugee 
camp in the Gaza Strip died from her wounds this morning after 
being wounded in a shooting incident with soldiers several days 
ago.

  [Text] Since yesterday afternoon the security forces have 
been doing battle with several terrorists who barricaded 
themselves in a house in Hebron. During the exchanges of fire, 
several terrorists were hit, but their condition is not yet 
known. During the fire exchanges yesterday two Hebron women 
were wounded. According to an initial IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] investigation, the women were hit by terrorists' 
gunfire, rather than by the IDF. One of the women was seriously 
wounded and died a short time later in Hebron's 'Aliya Hospital. 
The other woman was slightly wounded in the head and was 
evacuated to a hospital in Jerusalem after being treated on the 
spot by an IDF doctor. From the IDF's investigation it 
transpired that the two were hit by the terrorists' gunfire. 
Hebron is under curfew and the area was declared a closed 
military zone. 
  Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq has just told 
the Shamgar Commission that the 18 hour-long battle with the 
terrorists in Hebron has just ended. Our correspondent Moti 
Amir reports that to the best of his knowledge five IDF soldiers 
were slightly wounded in the fire exchanges. They were 
evacuated for treatment at a Jerusalem hospital. The bodies of 
three terrorists were found in the building in which they were 
barricaded in the al-Taraq neighborhood in Hebron; Kalashnikov 
rifles and a Glilon submachine gun were found near the bodies. 
During the battle the IDF directed antitank missiles and 
machine gun fire at the building. Last night the area was lit 
with flares; early this morning a large bulldozer was brought to 
the area to demolish one of the buildings in which the 
terrorists barricaded themselves. The bulldozer broke down and 
it was necessary to bring in another bulldozer this afternoon to 
recover the first one. The terrorists attacked the soldiers 
operating the bulldozer, and at that point the IDF forces 
stormed the building and killed the terrorists. 
  Our correspondent notes that in during the operation the 
management of the al-Muhtasib children's hospital -- which is 
located near the building concerned -- complained that soldiers 
entered the hospital premises and that the children hospitalized 
were greatly alarmed by the explosions and gunfire.

  [Text] Sanaa, March 22 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni forces fired 
warning shots at a fighter plane from the rival south on Monday 
as it flew low overhead, northern sources said Tuesday. 
  The armies of the former North and South Yemens have not 
merged since the two countries unified in May 1990 and there 
have been frequent clashes between the sides in recent months. 
  The plane was not hit as warning shots were fired as it 
overflew units from the northern al-'Amaliqah [Giants] brigade 
based [in] Abyan, in southern Yemen, the sources said. 
  The country's rival leaders have been involved in a long 
running feud, and tension has risen with the deployment of the 
rival armies in each other's territory. 
  The shooting happened a few hours before a mutual news 
blackout on such incidents was imposed by the two sides. 
  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his ruling General 
People's Congress from the north have been at loggerheads with 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid's Yemeni Socialist Party from 
the poorer south for seven months.

  [Text] Rival Yemeni parties are reported to have agreed to 
pull out their troops from the provincial capital 'Ataq in the 
southern oil-producing region of Shabwah.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah in London and unattributed </F>
report from Sanaa: "Sanaa Accuses al-'Attas of Secessionism"] 
  [Excerpt] Statements made by [Prime Minister] Engineer 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas have greatly upset Sanaa. Observers 
say that the General People's Congress [GPC] has given these 
statements more significance than they deserve and have 
understood them to "mean the removal of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih" who himself has launched a similar attack on al-'Attas. 
A statement attributed to a GPC information source said that 
al-'Attas is the one "who should be removed." 
  That was a part of Sanaa's violent reaction to press 
statements attributed to the Yemeni prime minister in which he 
said that "there are some political symbols which must be 
removed and actions which must stop if the Yemeni Government is 
to be able to carry out its duties." 
  The GPC statement said that "removal of al-'Attas would be 
in 
the interest of stability in Yemen because he has been an 
obstacle in the way of development projects and in the way of 
the efforts to build a modern Yemeni state since the 
reunification of the homeland on 22 May 1990, and he has 
discharged his duties with a narrow partisan mentality to serve 
selfish and personal interests." It added that he (al-'Attas) 
"is one of the main renegade and secessionist elements in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and one of those who engineered the 
current political crisis." 
  It should he recalled that al-'Attas had criticized the 
attitude of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
interference in government affairs by issuing direct orders to 
ministers and officials and clearly ignoring the prime minister. 
He also addressed a message to him -- unprecedented anywhere in 
the world -- urging him to face his responsibilities as head of 
state on such matters as smuggling and counterfeit foreign and 
Yemeni currency, and to take serious measures against the 
influential figures and centers of power which protect 
terrorists and outlaws. [passage omitted]

Sanaa: "The Yemeni Leadership Asks the Socialist Party and 
Opposition Leaders To Leave Sanaa"] 
  [Excerpt] Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] officials have 
confirmed that the Yemeni leadership has asked some of the YSP 
leaders still in Sanaa as well as a number of opposition leaders 
to leave Sanaa "for security reasons." 
  They added that Interior Minister Brigadier General Yahya 
al-Mutawakkil was instructed to inform Yahya al-Shami and Fish 
Resources Minister Fadl Muhsin 'Abdallah, both of whom are 
members of the YSP's Political Bureau, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Quddus 
al-Midwahi, who is one of the leaders of the Nasirite Unionist 
Organization, to leave Sanaa. They are all members of the 
Political Forces Dialogue Committee. 
  A YSP spokesman said that this "meant that people were being 
expelled from their own homeland and that the way was being 
paved for further developments later on." Sources in Sanaa 
stressed that dismissal of Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas's 
cabinet and formation of a new cabinet under the chairmanship of 
another YSP leader was being seriously considered because of the 
continuing political battle and exchange of accusations between 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Engineer al-'Attas. [passage

  [Text] Special Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross 
left Amman tonight after talks on the peace process, bilateral 
ties, and the siege of al-'Aqabah. 
  Ross met earlier tonight with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, which was followed by bilateral talks between the 
Jordanian and U.S. delegations. 
  Before leaving Amman, Ross said his talks were good and 
businesslike, and that he expects the peace talks to resume soon. 
  Speaking to reporters at Amman airport, Information Minister 
Jawad al-'Anani said tonight's talks also covered the resumption 
of Jordanian-Israeli bilateral talks in Washington, as well as 
economic ties. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Anani] We had very good, serious, and 
businesslike discussions today. We covered a range of topics. 
Mr. Ross was kind enough to give us an update on the 
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. We also 
dealt with the issue of bilateral issues, like sanctions in 
al-'Aqabah, and also our economic bilateral relations. Well, we 
think that some progress is going to take place very soon, and 
we are going to see tangible results. We also had a discussion 
of how to proceed next on the negotiations, and how to 
invigorate the Jordanian-Israeli track when we meet in 
Washington, hopefully in April. 
  [Unidentified reporter] I would like to ask about the 
Israelis and Palestinians. They said that they agreed on 
international armed presence in Hebron, Gaza, and Jericho. They 
said that the United States and Norway agreed to participate in 
this. Could you elaborate? 
  [Ross] Well, the discussions that they had covered a number 
of areas, including trying to reach understandings on 
security-related issues, and also looking at how one can move 
rapidly to conclude the negotiations and move towards an 
implementation. I am not going to go into the specifics of what 
they are working on right now, because I think their discussions 
are ongoing. 
  [Reporter] I would like to ask you about the siege of 
al-'Aqabah. It is affecting Jordan tremendously. Are you 
going, and do you have any plans to lift the embargo, when? 
  [Ross] Well, we had a discussion. As the minister said, we 
had a discussion on that. We have been exchanging views on 
that. And we are going to be working on that as best we can.

<F P=106> [Randah Habib report from Amman] </F>
  [Text] In his talks with U.S. coordinator Dennis Ross, 
Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali concentrated on 
the need to lift the naval siege clamped on the port of 
al-'Aqabah three years ago as this siege is adversely affecting 
Jordan's economy. This was emphasized to our station by an 
authoritative source, who added that the talks also dealt with 
the U.S. position on Security Council Resolution 904 on the 
Hebron massacre. Jordan asked Washington to explain its 
abstention from voting on the paragraph which stated that 
Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories and whether this 
abstention constitutes a change in the U.S. position on the holy 
city. 
  The House of Representatives strongly condemned the U.S. 
position on Jerusalem and denounced what it termed the 
continuous U.S. aggression on the Arab nation. It asked the 
Jordanian Government not to return to the negotiations before 
the siege of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted and so announced at 
the Security Council. The deputies said this siege is aimed at 
bringing pressure to bear on Jordan with all possible means to 
deprive it of its free decision vis-a-vis all issues of concern 
to the nation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of </F>
state for foreign affairs, by unidentified correspondent in 
Salalah; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to 
Oman is important. Would you please comment on this visit? 
  [Al-Hasan] I want to reiterate the deep and distinguished 
Jordanian-Omani relations that have been reinforced by His 
Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id. As you know, these relations are becoming stronger 
with time. These relations, which are fraternal in terms of 
dealing and frank in terms of coordination and consultation, 
have become an example for other countries. King Husayn's visit 
to his brother Sultan Qabus falls within this framework. These 
relations are based on the existing fraternal relations between 
the two leaders and two people. I can say these relations are 
strong, firm, and continuous. The two countries are determined 
to strengthen these relations on all levels. 
  I can also say that the high level of consultation and 
coordination will include many bilateral issues and many Arab, 
regional, and international issues. King Husayn's visit 
represents a qualitative move that will strength Jordanian-Omani 
relations. 
  [Correspondent] Your Excellency: Today, you met with the 
Omani minister of state for foreign affairs. What took place 
during the meeting? 
  [Al-Hasan] I held a fraternal meeting with my brother His 
Excellency Yusuf Bin-'Alawi, the Omani minister of state for 
foreign affairs. We reviewed our good and distinguished 
bilateral relations on the political, economic, and cultural 
levels. We discussed a number of measures to provide momentum 
to these relations, to develop them, and to activate our 
bilateral agreements. I also discussed with the minister a 
number of Arab, regional, and international issues of mutual 
interest. Thank you. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, sir.

  [Text] Tomorrow, His Majesty King Husayn will begin a visit 
to the fraternal State of Qatar, during which he will hold talks 
with his brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, amir of the State of Qatar, on the regional state of 
affairs, means of promoting Arab solidarity, and the latest 
developments in the peace process in the aftermath of the recent 
passage of UN Security Council Resolution 904. 
  His Majesty King Husayn today continued his talks with his 
brother His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman. The talks 
addressed bilateral ties and the Arab state of affairs. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, 
has stated that His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Oman marks a 
significant historical juncture and a qualitative leap in 
inter-Arab ties. On his talks today with the Omani minister of 
state for foreign affairs, al-Hasan said in a telephone 
interview: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Samawi] Sir, what are the 
most important results of the talks held between His Majesty 
King Husayn and His Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, if you 
please? 
  [Al-Hasan] On this good occasion, I would like to reiterate 
the deep and distinguished Jordanian-Omani relations, which have 
been reinforced by His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His 
Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id. As you know, these relations 
are becoming stronger with time. These relations, which are 
fraternal in terms of dealing and frank in terms of coordination 
and consultation, have become an example for other countries. 
King Husayn's visit to his brother Sultan Qabus falls within 
this framework. These relations are based on the existing 
fraternal relations between the two leaders and two peoples. I 
can say that these relations are strong, firm, and continuous. 
  [Samawi] Sir, his majesty the king will tomorrow begin an 
official visit to the fraternal State of Qatar. In your view, 
how important is this visit? What are the implications of this 
visit at this point in time? 
  [Al-Hasan] His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the State of 
Qatar will add a new dimension to the good and special bilateral 
ties. God be praised, Jordanian-Qatari ties have continued to 
be promoted. The good ties binding his majesty the king to his 
brother Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the amir of the 
State of Qatar, constitute the basis and the foundation 
nurturing these fraternal ties. The visit by his majesty the 
king to the State of Qatar is part of the continuous 
consultations and coordination under way between the two leaders 
and officials of the two countries on various bilateral, Arab, 
regional, and international issues. The visit is also aimed at 
examining the prospects of enhancing and promoting these ties in 
all spheres. His majesty the king's visit will undoubtedly mark 
a true and qualitative leap in bilateral ties. Moreover, it will 
add an additional brick to the edifice of the bilateral ties. 
It will also contribute to promoting and enhancing Arab 
solidarity. His majesty the king has always shown an eagerness 
to reinforce Arab solidarity. His majesty the king has urged 
continuous efforts to safeguard and protect Arab solidarity, and 
to restore inter-Arab cohesion so that Arabs may be able to meet 
challenges in these difficult and critical times. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "King Husayn's Oman, Qatar Visits"] </F>
  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn's talks in Oman and later 
in Qatar are especially important given Jordan's major pan-Arab 
role in the Arab arena. Oman and Qatar are important players 
both in the Gulf and in the wider Arab arena. 
  King Husayn's Oman visit should further enhance the common 
outlook shared by his majesty and the sultan of Oman on Arab 
issues at this critical point in Arab history, a time when the 
Arabs need to exert themselves in the interest of increased 
solidarity and common understanding. 
  The role being played by Jordan and Oman in the context of 
containing the Yemeni crisis is an indication of a common 
perspective on the challenges facing the Arab nation. This 
makes His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Oman doubly important. 
  His majesty's visit to Qatar is no less important, 
especially 
given that it will be his first since the Gulf crisis, which, if 
it were not for the bold and enlightened stands of such Arab 
states as Qatar, might have torn the fabric of inter-Arab 
relations to shreds. 
  We are optimistic and hopeful that King Husayn's talks in 
Oman and Qatar will yield dividends for a brighter Arab future. 
We are confident that the kind of pan-Arab sense of 
responsibility typical of the courageous leadership in Oman and 
Qatar will go a long way toward furthering Arab solidarity, 
irrespective of the obstacles that have piled up along the way.

  [Text] Some Jordanian food companies have received letters 
from an Israeli company called Global Information Ltd. inviting 
them to participate in some advance food industry courses, 
supervised by a British scientific research association, in the 
Hilton Hotel, Tel Aviv, next June. 
  The letter said this would be an opportunity to benefit from 
the advance courses and meet with and be introduced to 
colleagues from Israel and other countries in the region, as 
well as an opportunity to visit Tel Aviv. The letter indicated 
that the organizing company is ready to arrange hotel 
reservations, receive participants at the airport, and have 
visas issued to those needing them. 
  The letter said the organizers will be happy to arrange 
meetings with the Israeli food companies and urged participants 
not to hesitate to contact the organizers for further details. 
  The letter is signed by Avi Gordon, general manager of 
Global 
Information Ltd. It has been learned that these letters reached 
Jordan via Norway. 
  The Jordanian companies that received the letter expressed 
their surprise at and denunciation of this invitation, which 
they thought was an Israeli psychological maneuver aimed at 
breaking the Arab boycott even before concluding peace 
agreements.

  [Text] Amman, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- According to 
informed Iraqi sources, the governors of Ninawa and Babil were 
recently dismissed from their posts in the course of a 
mobilization process which began a month ago throughout Iraq. 
  The sources said that Ninawa Governor (for less than a year) 
Staff Major General 'Abd-al-Wahid Shinan Al Ribat was relieved 
of his post after a clash between, on the one hand, butchers and 
grocers in the Mosul market and, on the other, a Special Forces 
unit which tried to force them to cut their prices after the 
wave of disturbances which had swept Mosul. He was also blamed 
for the increase in the number of explosions and assassination 
attempts in the town. 
  Babil Governor Lieutenant General Tali' Khalil al-Rahim 
al-Duri was relieved of his post, which he had held for three 
years after the Gulf war. He was the target of a press campaign 
accusing him of mismanagement. The fate of the two governors is 
not known, and there have been no appointments replacing them in 
these posts. 
  Meanwhile, the Iraqi "Free Revolutionary Officers Movement" 
[IFROM] has revealed that there was an attempt to assassinate 
Iraqi Defense Minister 'Ali Hasan al-Majid 9 March. 
  In a statement, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT yesterday, the movement said that one of its units 
carried out the operation, in which 'Ali Hasan al-Majid 
sustained leg and hand injuries and his aide, Police Major Salih 
Arjah, and two guards were killed outside the Iraqi defense 
minister's home in Baghdad. 
  The statement said that the nucleus of the IFROM was formed 
before Saddam Husayn's forces invaded Kuwait and that it 
includes a group of senior officers and soldiers, including 
prominent officers in important positions. 
  The statement added that 136 IFROM officers and soldiers 
have 
been martyred in operations against the regime's forces and that 
in the first two months of this year it distributed thousands of 
antiregime leaflets in the camps of al-Rashid, al-Taji, 
al-Suwayrah, al-Rashidiyah, and Khan Bani-Sa'id. 
  It urged the Iraqi opposition forces to unite and end their 
political rivalry, and it stressed that the desired change 
should emanate from within Iraq and from within the Armed Forces. 
  It also said that it strives for a truly democratic regime 
in 
Iraq, for Iraq's return to the Arab fold, for fraternal and 
good-neighborly relations with the neighboring states, and for 
the reconstruction of a strong Iraqi economy.

  [Text] Sar Dasht, Kordestan Prov, March 19, IRNA -- Two 
Iraqi battalions along with their equipment joined the 
opposition forces in Northern Iraq, a statement by the Supreme 
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq (SAIRI) said here 
today. 
  The statement said the battalions had been stationed between 
the regions under the control of the self-declared government of 
Northern Iraq and Chamchamal region in the Karkuk Province. 
  There are six officers among the forces, possibly affiliated 
to the Iraqi First Corps, the statement said, adding that due to 
the harsh economic conditions and political isolation of Iraq, 
the number of the personnel deserting the army is increasing in 
the country. 
  According to the sources close to the SAIRI, the Iraqi 
forces 
would probably intensify their military pressures on the 
northern and southern population, in addition to increasing 
their threats against Kuwait on the coming days.

  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 20, (AFP) -- Two villages have 
been virtually destroyed in recent renewed shelling by Tehran of 
Iranian Kurds sheltering in northern Iraq, Iranian Kurdish 
leaders said Sunday. 
  General Secretary of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran 
(KDPI) Mostafa Hejri accused Iran of "killing and attacking 
Kurds here in the same way as in Iran." 
  He told AFP from his headquarters in Kou Senjaq, northern 
Iraq, that in the past month "two villages have been nearly 
totally destroyed by Iranian shelling," although there had been 
casualties [sentence as received]. 
  Hejri added that Tehran had only stopped its attacks on the 
Iranian Kurdish population during winter. 
  Kurdish security forces added that an Iranian, who was 
active 
in the Iranian Kurdish movement had been killed in 
al-Sulaymaniyah, in the east of Kurdish-controlled northern 
Iraq, several days ago. 
  Northern Iraq passed to Kurdish control, with the backing of 
the allied forces, after the end of the Gulf war in February 
1991. 
  The KDPI, the main Kurdish opposition party in Iran, has 
several bases in northern Iraq close to the Iranian border, and 
in the past there has been intermittent shelling of the border 
areas.

  [Text] The Political Bureau of the [pro-government] 
Kurdistan Democratic Party has said that our Kurdish people, 
whom leader President Saddam Husayn has loved and for whom he 
has done his best to vindicate their legitimate national rights, 
will remain loyal to the hands that have shown them generosity 
and nobility. 
  In a cable sent to leader President Saddam Husayn on the 
Nauruz festivities, the Political Bureau added that the 
Kurdistan Democratic Party seizes the opportunity granted by 
this noble occasion to extend to his excellency the leader 
president the most sublime, sincere, and heartfelt 
congratulations, and beseeches God Almighty to go grant him 
continued good health, to protect him as an asset for all free 
people, and to render the Nauruz a feast on which the will of 
the well-meaning Kurds will triumph against the forces of 
agentry and deception associated with the United States, the 
enemy of mankind. The clique of agents and traitors has flouted 
all honorable values. It is indifferent to the harm caused to 
the Kurdistan Region and the Iraqi people, and to the injustice 
and wrong done them. 
  The Political Bureau of the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
added: 
On Nauruz, Jawal Haddath, a righteous son of the Kurdish 
people, brandished his sword in the face of the tyrant Izdahak 
al-Dahhak to end his tyranny and bring about security and 
stability throughout Kurdistan. At present, you are the hero of 
the age. You have set an example for free men of the world. 
And here you are brandishing your sword, the sword of right, in 
the face of the unscrupulous tyrants, atheistic infidels, and 
all misled agents and traitors in defense of not only the Iraqi 
people, but also tortured humanity and free people of the world, 
who are suffering at the hands of the tyrannical ones. You have 
triumphed against them. Hence, the eternal annals of history 
will document your bright and heroic feats. 
  The cable went on to say: It is true that the agents have 
rendered the situation in Kurdistan intolerable due to the 
lawlessness and sabotage they have caused to serve their 
masters. But, it remains to be said that your Kurdish people 
will continue to honor their pledge. They will remain sleepless 
until Kurdistan restores its security and stability and kicks 
out traitors and their masters so that it may return to the laps 
of the homeland, joyful and proud. The day of victory is 
imminent. Neither the unfair embargo, nor the machinations of 
colonialists, or the treason of traitors are capable of bringing 
your Iraqi people, be they Arabs or Kurds, to their knees. The 
Iraqi people will continue to hold their heads high. The 
banners of pride, glory, and dignity will continue to flutter 
throughout Iraq as long as you are its leader.

<F P=106> [Remarks by President Husni Mubarak followed by his response </F>
to a question from radio correspondent Muntasir Rahmi on 22 
March; from the "The World on the Air" program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Mubarak] Egyptian industry really needs no 
testimony from me. A very high percentage of our private sector 
and business sector factories could be exporting their products. 
As long as they export their products, what better testimony do 
they need? [passage omitted] 
  [Rahmi] Do the things you saw during your tour today reflect 
the state of stability in Egypt? 
  [Mubarak] Egypt is stable. Incidents that occur here and 
there are no big issue. Such things happen daily in the world. 
But some parties blow things out of proportion. We also used 
to exaggerate the issue. To increase their circulation, our 
newspapers used to carry banner headlines about incidents not 
worth such headlines. Every day I see incidents happen 
everywhere that are hundreds of times more frequent than the 
incidents in our country. I declare that Egypt is secure and 
stable, despite the minor incidents, which, God willing, will 
disappear. I hope that the youths who accept a little cash to 
do these silly things will regain their senses and realize that 
their actions do not serve the country's interests or their own 
or their families' interests. All industry, investment, 
tourism, and similar projects create jobs for people. When they 
carry out these actions, they are costing people's livelihood. 
Thank you. 
  [Rahmi] Thank you, sir.
