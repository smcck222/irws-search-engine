  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met 
today with Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle East 
peace negotiations. 
  During this meeting, discussions focused on the latest 
developments in the peace process and the problems it is 
encountering, in particular the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
committed by the Israeli settlers against the Palestinian 
worshipers. 
  After his meeting with Foreign Minister Musa, Ross stated 
that they held detailed discussions about the peace process. 
  Ross added that he informed 'Amr Musa of the results of his 
discussions in Tunis. He clarified that these talks were 
"encouraging." 
  Ross described the discussions he held with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat as "constructive." He said Chairman 
'Arafat's talks with the Israelis were also constructive. 
  The American official expressed his hope that some progress 
will be made regarding security and understanding in the Middle 
East. 
  Ross also expressed his hope that progress be made quickly 
in 
the negotiations regarding the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  He said that during the past two days extensive and serious 
talks have been held between the concerned parties to address 
all issues. 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated that during their meeting 
today Dennis Ross informed him of the results of his talks in 
Tunis with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, as well as the 
talks between the Palestinian leadership and the Israeli 
delegation that recently visited Tunis. 
  'Amr Musa said that he understands there will be a 
continuation of these Palestinian-Israeli talks regarding the 
situation in Hebron and other topics dealing with Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  On the possibility of convening a meeting between 'Arafat 
and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, 'Amr Musa said there is 
no further information on this matter and that he cannot confirm 
it. He expressed his hope that some breakthrough will be made in 
the stance or that Israel will withdraw very soon. He also 
hoped that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement will be realized 
soon.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah and </F>
former Egyptian Ambassador to Algeria Husayn Amin by Tal'at 
al-Mughrabi in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Mughrabi] What are the similarities between 
Egypt's and Algeria's Islamic fundamentalism? 
  ['Amarah] The term fundamentalism, as used in the Western 
sense, has a negative connotation. In the Islamic and Arabic 
sense, fundamentalists are groups that advocate jihad and 
revival and they are not, as is the case in the West, 
ungrateful, reactionary, and imitative. The aspects that all 
Islamic movements in the whole Islamic world have in common are 
that they have an Islamic source [al-marji'iyah al-islamiyah] 
and form an alternative to Western secularism and materialism. 
They seek to establish a totally Islamic society and a state 
committed to the Islamic shari'ah. However, they can be 
distinguished from one another and their programs vary according 
to their own national situations and the challenges confronting 
them. The Islamic movement in Egypt is not newly-formed, as is 
the case in Algeria. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two 
movements? 
  ['Amarah] The Muslim Brotherhood constitutes the major 
Islamic movement in Egypt. It is the mother movement of all 
Islamic movements worldwide. In Egypt there are a group of 
ulema, thinkers, and innovative and creative revivalists who are 
involved in the Islamic cultural plan. Egyptian society does 
not accept large-scale violence. In Algeria, the Islamic 
movement is new and is poor in cadres. The Algerian movement 
represents a grouping of trends and is a front in the real sense 
of the word. Also, the challenges of Westernization and the 
francophonists in Algeria are more intense in view of the 
influence of French colonization. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between 
the 
two movements? 
  ['Amarah] No. The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria 
is purely Algerian and emanated from Algeria. The Algerian 
group that is methodologically linked to the Muslim Brotherhood 
is "Hamas" [The Algerian Islamic Society Movement]. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities' 
relationship with each group? 
  ['Amarah] The present regime in Algeria derives from an 
illegal coup against the Algerian nation's choice. This is not 
the case in Egypt. Also, violence in Algeria is comprehensive 
and severe, whereas in Egypt a limited number commit acts of 
violence, although the information media exaggerate them. 
Violence in Egypt meets violence from a sector of the state, 
but not all the state supports violence and not all the Islamic 
movement supports violence. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements 
in 
Egypt and Algeria? 
  ['Amarah] The Islamic movement in Algeria will inevitably 
triumph because all the people support it and the Algerian 
regime is completely impotent. The situation in Egypt is 
different. The Egyptian regime's resources are much greater 
than those of the Algerian one. However, the red lines that the 
outside world draws against any change in favor of Islam in 
Egypt are much clearer in view of Egypt's role and influence. 
Moreover, the Islamic movement in Egypt is not facing a 
dilemma. The dilemma in Egypt lies in the absence of secular 
parties among the masses. My conviction is that the Islamic 
trend in Egypt is not in a hurry to take power; its present goal 
is to have an opportunity to act legally, and this would lessen 
the violence that is distorting the image of the Islamic trend. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the 
ruling 
regime continue? 
  ['Amarah] It will continue as long as the regime prevents 
the 
Islamic trend from exercising lawful and legal rights in 
accordance with the democratic rules and as long as it refuses 
to yield power, particularly if the masses elect the Islamic 
trend. If the regimes in Egypt and Algeria agree to honest 
elections and provide an opportunity for all diverse ideological 
trends, the confrontation will come to an end and violence will 
decline. 
  [Al-Mughrabi) Do you really expect either of the movements 
to 
take power? 
  ['Amarah] That the Islamic trend is fated to take power in 
all Islamic countries is inescapable. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] What are the similarities between Egypt's and 
Algeria's Islamic fundamentalism? 
  [Amin] These two phenomena have an identical socioeconomic 
background particularly in the obvious features of unemployment, 
housing shortages, slums, corruption, high cost of living, and 
inflation. Another similarity lies in the just demand of both 
Islamic streams to establish a government that will apply 
Islamic shari'ah. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two 
movements? 
  [Amin] There is a difference that results from Algeria's 
history and its bitter struggle against French colonialism. In 
that struggle Algeria had to raise the banner of Islam, not the 
banner of Algerian or pan-Arab nationalism, in order to secure 
the loyalty of the Berbers, who comprise more than 30 percent of 
the population. Consequently Algeria's Islamic appeal began 
before its Egyptian counterpart. Another difference is the 
topography of the land. Unlike Egypt, Algeria has hilly terrain 
that facilitates resistance and jihad operations, and subsequent 
escape. The third difference is that Algerians lack proficiency 
in the Arabic language because of French colonialism. As a 
result, an ordinary member of any Islamic group in Egypt knows 
more about Islam than the FIS leaders themselves. I realized 
this during a 3-hour meeting with Abbasi Madani. A third 
difference is the Algerians' hot temper, resulting no doubt from 
their long struggle against colonialism. This quality is 
evident in the FIS terrorists' actions against the government. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between 
the 
two movements? 
  [Amin] Certainly there are. When I was ambassador in Algeria 
I knew perfectly well that contacts were going on and that 
dozens of FIS members were constantly traveling to Egypt on 
commercial or educational pretexts. Members of Egypt's Islamic 
groups were doing the same thing, and the Egyptian intelligence 
services were aware of that. When I noticed that these contacts 
were going too far, I proposed restoration of visa requirements 
for travel between the two countries. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities' 
relationship with each group? 
  [Amin] Just as the two Islamic groups communicate and 
coordinate with each other, the Egyptian and Algerian 
Governments are also coordinating their stands. I believe that 
the two regimes are very wrong to handle this issue from the 
security angle alone. This method is fruitless, especially as 
these groups do not value life very highly and eagerly seek 
martyrdom in order to go to paradise. This is why I believe 
terrorist actions will continue. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements 
in 
Egypt and Algeria? 
  [Amin] Algeria has no Christian minority like Egypt. It does 
not have a problem similar to the Egyptian Christians' refusal 
to be governed according to shari'ah. The real dilemma in both 
countries is the existence of an intellectual class that rejects 
Islamic rule. If the Islamists take power, the intellectuals 
will emigrate. Algerian intellectuals began to leave the country 
after the Islamists won the local elections in 1990. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the 
ruling 
regime continue? 
  [Amin] It will continue until either the regime or the 
Islamic trend is defeated. 
  [Al-Mughrabi] Do you really expect either of the two 
movements to take power? 
  [Amin] This is more likely to happen in Algeria than in 
Egypt, particularly as [Algerian President Lamine] Zeroual has 
begun reconciliation moves. In Egypt the terror will last for 
many more years.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Atif al-Ghamri: "The West, Islam, and the </F>
Democratic Notion"] 
  [Excerpts] Warnings about the danger of Islam that are 
spreading in the West, particularly in the United States, and 
the lumping of it together with Nazism and communism remain a 
method that has its own reasons for those who are making these 
charges. 
  This issue was tackled with total neutrality by the thinker 
and writer John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat: 
Myth or Reality, in which he dwells on the issue of 
democracy. He wrote that part of the theory on the Islamic 
threat is the belief that Islam is historically hostile to 
democracy and tolerance. 
  The author raises a number of points that influence this 
theory or belief. They are: 
  The West's view of the Islamic Middle East is dictated by 
the 
need to guarantee its oil interests. Therefore, the West's 
route to stability in the Middle East does not pass through 
democracy but toward maintaining the status quo. 
  Political realities in most Islamic countries in the world 
have never been ready for the development of democratic 
traditions and institutions. European colonial rule and the 
national governments that came to power during the 
post-independence era have added to a heritage that never cared 
for political participation or for building strong democratic 
institutions. 
  Economic weakness, illiteracy, and high unemployment -- 
especially among the young generations -- have doubly aggravated 
the situation, undermined confidence in governments, and 
increased the attraction of any antigovernment slogans, 
regardless of these slogans' principles. 
  History has taught us that the transformation of European 
political principles from rule that depended on divine right to 
democratic countries was accompanied by a reform process and a 
redirection from political individualism to the democratic 
notion. This means that the democratic notion did not stem from 
the core of European society but from the reform process that 
spread fully to all its structures, positions, establishments, 
and ways of life. 
  Islam itself allows different interpretations. It has 
advocates of the democratic notion in the same way it has 
advocates of autocratic rule or rule by a minority. The trends 
that believe in democracy represent the normal course of things 
while the advocates of autocracy or rule by a minority are a 
transient and erratic phenomenon that does not have deep roots 
in these societies. 
  John Esposito in his book The Islamic Threat: Myth or 
Reality has thus analyzed the extent of the Western belief 
that Islam is hostile to democracy and tolerance. 
  The fact is that democracy is not a cliche or a vague 
expression but an active mechanism that protects the nation from 
the autocrat's tyranny and sets up a control system that 
protects the nation from imbalance, errors, and corruption. 
This is the proof whether a regime is legitimate or not. It is 
based on a plurality of views, opinions, and stands. Islam 
essentially agrees with this and does not conflict with it. 
  If there is something that creates the impression that Islam 
is the opposite of this, it is not Islam but those who nominally 
affiliate themselves to Islam, either rulers or ruled. They 
have tyrannized man and intentionally canceled or neutralized 
his role, while God Almighty has created man as a sane human 
being with a role that no other person can take away, with the 
right to participate in and influence the decision-making 
process. [passage omitted] 
  Thus, the campaign by the media and some study centers in 
the 
West to depict Islam as the companion of antidemocratic 
terrorism is partly based on superficiality and on picking 
temporary phenomena like skin rashes as health symptoms. It is 
also partly based on intentional and premeditated conduct, whose 
architects understand that hostility to democracy is the 
behavior of individuals or groups -- both rulers and ruled -- 
and does not lie at the heart or essence of Islam. They also 
understand that it is in the political interest of the West 
itself to maintain the current situation, even if this demands 
that it squanders any opportunity to revive democracy.

  [Text] Damascus, 22 Mar (SANA)--His Highness Shaykh 'Isa 
Bin-Salman Al Khalifah, the amir of Bahrain, paid an official 
visit to the Syrian Arab Republic from 20 to 22 March 1994 in 
response to an invitation by President Hafiz al-Asad of the 
Syrian Arab Republic. 
  This visit by his highness and the accompanying delegation 
embodies the firm brotherly relations between the Syrian Arab 
Republic and Bahrain. These relations are reinforced and 
strengthened by fraternal ties, Arab affiliation, unity of 
objectives, and common fate. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad and His Highness Shaykh 'Isa 
Bin-Salman Al Khalifah held cordial talks that focused on 
relations between the two fraternal countries and on 
strengthening bilateral coordination and cooperation. Talks 
also focused on the most important regional and international 
issues of common interest. The views of both sides were 
identical and in agreement on these issues. 
  To reiterate this approach, ministers of both sides held 
several rounds of talks that focused on invigorating fields of 
cooperation and exchange to serve the good and interests of the 
fraternal peoples of both countries. 
  This visit acquires special importance since it takes place 
in critical Arab circumstances that stress the importance and 
inevitability of such Arab visits and meetings in order to 
revive solidarity and coordination among the brothers, to 
confront what the world faces in terms of regional and 
international developments and changes, and to achieve common 
objectives. These objectives relate to the full restoration of 
occupied Arab territories, including occupied Syrian Golan and 
Arab Jerusalem, in implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 in order to realize a just, 
comprehensive, and durable peace in the region. 
  In this regard, the two sides condemned the holy Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre and held the Israeli policy of settlements and 
intransigence fully responsible. 
  At the conclusion of his visit and during the tours he and 
the accompanying delegation conducted, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa 
Bin-Salman Al Khalifah expressed his appreciation and admiration 
of what he sensed and saw as far as manifestations of 
development and awakening the Syrian Arab Republic has achieved 
under President Hafiz al-Asad, the leader of its march. 
  His highness wished the people of the Syrian Arab Republic 
progress and prosperity and wished President Hafiz al-Asad 
continued good health. 
  Moreover, His Highness Shaykh 'Isa Bin-Khalifah Al Khalifah 
extended an invitation to President Hafiz al-Asad of the Syrian 
Arab Republic to officially visit Bahrain, which he thankfully 
accepted. The date of this visit will be fixed in the near 
future. 
  [Dated] Damascus, 22 March 1994

  [Text] Last night an aircraft carrying the bodies of those 
martyred in the crash of the Iranian C-130 plane landed at 
Mehrabad Airport. The aircraft was met at the airport amid 
magnificent ceremonies attended by the Air Force commander, the 
deputy foreign minister, and the charge d'affaires of the 
embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran in Moscow, who has lost 
all members of his family in that heart-wrenching tragedy. 
  The funeral ceremony of these martyrs was staged at noon 
today in the burial ground of Chizar's martyrs, in the presence 
of Foreign Minister Velayati, and with the participation of the 
masses of people. 
  Referring to the cause of the crash, one of the people who 
has just returned to Tehran from the scene of the crash told our 
correspondent: In view of the sensitivity of the issue, the 
mission of the investigation team has been extended to enable 
them to complete their investigation. He added: Preliminary 
investigations in the area have shown that the crash was not due 
to a technical fault, and the aircraft was in fact shot down. 
  He also denied reports issued by a news agency, and said: 
The 
downed aircraft was not moving toward the war zone with a 
particular objective. However, due to the rapid and sudden 
change in air pressure which led to windows being broken, the 
pilot was forced to divert the plane to low altitude areas to 
reduce the pressure.

  [Text] Tehran, March 20, IRNA -- President Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani in his message to the nation on the 
occasion of the start of the new solar hijri year, 1373, said he 
saw a bright future for Iran. 
  He said the country has put behind its first national 
development plan and is about to embark on the second 5-year 
plan with more confidence. 
  "The first plan worked a lot for the country and the effects 
of it will gradually become apparent. The first effect of it is 
that the country has acquired strength against conspiracies and 
unwelcome incidents. We have solidified the infrastructure of 
the country. 
  "In the cultural, educational and political sectors our 
people are at a high level of intelligence in the area of 
religion and politicis. Their presence on the scene and their 
Islamic conduct and their observance of Islamic dictates is 
among the peculiarities of this nation throughout the world, and 
we take pride in this nation," said the president. 
  He took note of reconstruction and development efforts and 
said the difference between the deprived areas before and after 
the plan is really very much. 
  "Our people have heard the statistics and the figures. The 
infrasturctural works such as water, electricity and gas and 
attention to the water and power of the villages, roads, 
airports, telecommunications and post for all has progressed at 
a very good level, which has brought us ahead of the development 
plan, and our people understand the presence of these 
communication affairs. 
  "Our country is not at all comparable to five years ago. The 
level of production has increased very much and we have 
approached self-sufficiency. In the area of foodstuffs, cattle, 
poultry, fisheries, forests and others, thanks God we have 
advanced with coordination," elaborated the president. 
  In the use of the resources of the country mines and 
industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran 
is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major 
elements for the industrialized world, he added. 
  Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during 
this period has almost quadruppled, and "if this movement 
continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large 
extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are 
mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence 
on the scene." 
  He said that for youth this year and in the future years 
there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of 
population our country is a young country, and our young forces 
require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the 
course of the revolution well." 
  The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by 
Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said 
"grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this 
policy will continue to be exercized so that this year from the 
point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and 
especially women we will have a successful year." 
  He was all praise for the armed forces and the unknown 
soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilence and 
sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era 
of holy defense (1980-88). 
  The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy 
industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants 
such as steel and petrochemicals. 
  "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of 
them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to 
some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectble 
traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We, 
too, will support them. 
  "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God 
willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities, 
especially for the people active in exports." 
  He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing 
people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled 
and the former pows and their proud families and with the 
efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran 
is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to 
embark on the tasks ahead. 
  He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year 
foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of 
the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year 
we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a 
chance to have more power on the market." 
  Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache. 
  "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan, 
Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places 
Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world 
arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam." 
  He said Iran was trying its best to to help Muslims and will 
continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems. 
  "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I 
think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and 
with cooperation," he was confident.

  [Text] Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the Iranian National 
Resistance Council, has described the new Persian year as the 
year in which the sun will rise brilliantly, signaling the 
liberation of the Iranian people. It will also be the year the 
regime that brought destruction to Iran will ebb, he noted. 
  In a congratulatory message addressed to the Iranian people 
on the Nauruz festivities and the beginning of a new Persian 
year, Rajavi added that the victories scored by the Iranian 
resistance last year undermined the structure of the ruling 
regime and surpassed the expectations of all observers. 
  Rajavi indicated that the ruling Iranian regime is 
experiencing an impasse due to resistance attacks and the 
political and military siege, which has confused it and rendered 
it unable to address aggravated crises. 
  Rajavi added that the popular protest waves which erupt from 
time to time throughout Iran confirm that the repression and 
oppression being used by the regime cannot muzzle free people 
throughout Iran. 
  Concluding his message, he noted that the UN Human Rights 
Commission's condemnation of the Tehran regime a few days ago 
confirm that this regime is illegal.

  [Text] Economics Division. The General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) was signed by 114 nations on 15 December. 
Following that the Islamic Republic of Iran's membership in GATT 
has been seriously considered by our nation's policymakers and 
officials. Conflicting views and explanations have been 
presented on this matter. Firuz Dowlatabadi, the Foreign 
Ministry's economic adviser and chief of its Office of Economic 
and Strategic Coordination, gave an interview to our 
correspondent in which he presented his views on this matter, 
the details of which are presented for you below: 
  The foreign minister's economic adviser discussed the 
effects 
and consequences of joining GATT. He said: International 
economic organizations cannot actually be evaluated on the basis 
of whether joining them has benefits or disadvantages. 
  International organizations, especially international 
economic organizations, are formed on the basis of a win-win 
strategy. Therefore, consensus is a principle in these 
organizations, and without a consensus their decisions are not 
implemented. 
  Dowlatabadi said: Membership in these organizations 
basically 
faces the profitability of the economic system of each country, 
and Iran will not be harmed by joining these organizations in 
the way that is being mentioned. However, one must assess the 
level of relative advantages in Iran and other nations of our 
country's steadfastness and determination and the level of the 
relative advantages that are in general unavailable to us and 
are available to the other member nations. 
  What will the future of their behavior be towards us in 
accordance with the government's policies, whether financial, 
monetary, foreign exchange or in commercial policy, and how far 
behind are we in this matter, or how far ahead of them are we? 
  The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and 
Strategic Cooperation emphasized: This kind of assesment is the 
basis for our estimate of the benefits or disadvantages to GATT 
membership. It is really improper for us to ask whether we will 
profit or lose by joining GATT, or to ask in what areas we will 
profit and in what areas we will lose. 
  He said: Because our assessment of GATT membership has been 
mistaken, despite the fact that the question of joining GATT has 
been under discussion continuously for almost 20 years (since 
the time before the revolution), no suitable conclusion has been 
reached. 
  The foreign minister's economic adviser noted: In 
international relations, if a country has the power to provide 
expert counsel and if it has more political and economic 
capacity, due to the fact that it has more factors for limiting 
trade, it will in turn make more profit. 
  He noted: One reason we have not gotten the necessary 
prerogatives to match the nation's political capacity in 
economic negotiations is our weak foundation of expert knowledge 
(consultative). Our expert system does not have the necessary 
capacity. Because negotiations do not take place at the level of 
ministers, deputy ministers or general managers, the weakness of 
expert knowledge has kept us from having the power to do the 
necessary bargaining, and has prevented us from having the 
ability to make use of negotiations. 
  The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and 
Strategic Cooperation added: Of course, GATT membership cannot 
be proposed as a means of overcoming this deficiency, but to 
compensate for this problem an acceptable level of privileges 
must be designated for the experts who participate in the 
negotiations, and they must not be allowed to depart from this 
framework. 
  He said: During the process of joining, very close and 
active 
cooperation must exist between the legislative and executive 
powers. With support from the law makers we can make the process 
of joining GATT lawful. 
  The foreign minister's economic adviser was asked whether 
there are obstacles to GATT membership in the Constitution. He 
said: There is no obstacle to GATT membership in the 
Constitution. Of course, support for some goods is provided in 
the Constitution and prohibitions are given on imports of some 
goods, and in this regard it is necessary to have cooperation 
between the legislative and executive powers. 
  For example, the level of the Majles's willingness to 
support 
industries in this year's budget law was such that the Majles 
added 10 percent to the taxes on imported vehicles. 
  He added: We will not be able to do this at this rate in the 
budget law if we join GATT, and if we join GATT any increase in 
tariffs will have to be done through negotiations with other 
members. 
  Dowlatabadi was asked whether aggressor foreign countries 
would become active in our country's banking and service affairs 
in the event of our GATT membership. He said: If we become a 
member, foreign banks will not necessarily become active in our 
country. There are many countries, such as Pakistan and 
Malaysia, where foreign banks cannot operate despite the fact 
that those countries are GATT members. 
  He emphasized: There are provisions in GATT that allow that 
in countries where there are legal obstacles negotiations will 
be held and they will be made exceptions to the list of 
provisions in the agreement. 
  The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and 
Strategic Cooperation discussed the short-term and long-term 
effects of GATT membership. He said: Basically, the process of 
acquiring GATT membership is not a short-term process. It takes 
at least five years. There can, therefore, be no short-term 
analysis of this subject. This certainly has to do with our 
long-term behavior. 
  Continuing, he added: In my view, our country will 
definitely 
profit from GATT membership and there will be no loss in the 
event we join. 
  Dowlatabadi discussed the formation of a national committee 
to study Iran's membership in GATT. He said: I recommend that a 
group from the Majles become members of this committee and that 
the request for Iran's membership in GATT be pursued rapidly. 
The members of the expert negotiation team must be selected. 
Iran's strategy for GATT membership must be specified, 
especially in areas that have to do with our newly established 
support system for exports, production and industries, and it 
must be given to the expert team so they will know on the basis 
of which items to pursue negotiations. More important is that 
there must be continuous and active cooperation between the 
legislative and executive powers for the study of GATT 
membership. 
  He emphasized: That illogical fear among policymakers and 
that illogical question concerning the profits and losses of 
GATT membership must be cleared from the minds of policymakers, 
and the process of GATT membership must be seriously pursued. 
  Dowlatabadi was asked whether we should take fundamental 
steps in the nation's economy and then become a member of GATT, 
or whether we could join it under current circumstances. He 
said: Joining GATT is not dependent on any circumstances. 
Nations are members of this organization with the strongest and 
the weakest economic foundations. The economic structure of a 
nation is not something that can be strengthened in the short 
term. 
  He was asked, in view of the fact that our country is mainly 
an importer of agricultural products and that our only export is 
oil, which is not related to GATT issues, and that in a few 
years the nation's import tariffs would have to be lowered and 
the payment of subsidies would gradually have to be stopped, 
whether joining would damage the nation's economy. He said: Our 
system of tariffs is not efficient, and our tariffs in the 
agricultural sector are quite low, even lower than GATT. At the 
same time, in other countries the existing tariff percentage is 
efficient and effective, and a decrease of several percentage 
points will have a great effect on the nation's economy, while 
this is not the case in our economy. Most of the tariff 
pressures are on the government itself. If we become a member of 
GATT we will be able to give greater support to the agricultural 
sector. 
  He added: There is also a 10- to 15-year period allowed to 
reduce subsidies. In this regard it is much better for our 
economic system to be put under pressure and to bring itself to 
the designated stage by that time. 
  The Foreign Ministry's economic adviser emphasized: There is 
no problem regarding the reduction of tariffs in Iran. Tariffs 
are no problem in our economic system. Even in a nontariff 
system, our nontariff supports are quite low compared to 
international members. 
  The chief of the Foreign Ministry's Office of Economic and 
Strategic Coordination discussed the effects of this agreement 
on regional economic pacts such as ECO [Economic Cooperation 
Organization]. He said: GATT includes an exception for regional 
cooperation. These regional cooperation pacts can exist with any 
kind of preferential tariff. Therefore, there is no obstacle in 
this and it encourages GATT at the outset. At the same time our 
economic activity has not yet taken efficient shape in ECO or 
any other framework in which it is felt that GATT might be 
harmful. 
  Dowlatabadi was asked whether the fact that America and the 
Zionist regime are GATT members with most-favored nation status 
might bring about the creation of relations with them. He said: 
In the preliminary negotiations one can make some countries 
exceptions to economic relations, and the membership of these 
two nations is no obstacle to joining GATT.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Khamene'i Trying To Tighten Grip on </F>
Iran's Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian 
religious leader 'Ali Khamene'i is expected to tighten his grip 
on Iran's foreign policy by appointing a number of new 
ambassadors to replace some of those believed to belong to 
President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's wing. 
  Highly placed political sources in Tehran said yesterday 
that 
Khamene'i is deterined to steer Iranian policy back to "its true 
revolutionary path" and to annul the experimental policy of 
normalization represented by Rafsanjani. 
  Monashir Badi, the Iranian constitutional expert in Tehran, 
says: The fact that Rafsanjani holds the title of president of 
the republic causes a lot of confusion in Western capitals. 
People hear that title and think that Rafsanjani is like the 
French and U.S. presidents, but our system is totally different. 
The real head of state here is Khamene'i who can dismiss the 
president, dissolve parliament, and suspend the Constitution if 
he wishes. Now Khamene'i is trying to make Western states 
understand that in the end they will have to deal with him and 
not Rafsanjani. 
  Kahmene'i sends this message by openly attacking the Western 
states with which Rafsanjani starts a secret dialogue. 
  Yahya Nabbut, another expert on the Iranian regime, says: 
"Khamene'i has made it clear that Rafsanjani has no power in 
such fields as defense, security, oil, and contact with the 
masses. Now the supreme leader is also saying that the 
president does not have the final say on foreign policy." 
  There is one issue on which conflicting signals have been 
coming out of Tehran. That issue is the number of Iranian 
pilgrims this year. Mohammad Mohammadi Reshari, who has the 
task of leading the pilgrims, has acceded to a government 
request that the number of pilgrims be halved. 
  That is in line with President Rafsanjani's policy of 
cutting 
hard currency expenditure in some sectors so that the country 
can finance imports of such necessities as food products and 
spare parts. The cost of Iranian pilgrimage is estimated at $3 
billion, based on 1989 figures, but some pilgrims buy more 
currency on the black market so as to be able to purchase 
commodities in Saudi Arabia which are scarce in Iran. 
  Observers offer three points in support of the view that 
Iran 
itself is trying to reduce the number of pilgrims: 
  1. The contracts signed with the airline companies, 
including the Bulgaria Balkan company, only cover half the 
number of seats that were available last year. 
  2. The number of people who received official written 
invitations to special courses on pilgrimage rites and other 
related matters has decreased. 
  3. Government departments, semi-public establishments, and 
other big organizations have been informed that their quotas 
will be cut by half as part of the government's austerity drive. 
  Iranian economy and finance ministries' reports indicate 
that 
Iran could save up to $1 billion by reducing the number of 
pilgrims. Iran is expected to suffer a fall of $5 billion in 
its other important savings in the next 12 months. 
  Khamene'i, however, is worried that a cut in the number of 
pilgrims might trigger accusations that his government is 
interfering with religious duties. That could destroy his 
efforts to secure a place among the highest echelon of mullas. 
  Badi says: "Rafsanjani was right to tell people that they 
have to save money. Khamene'i wants to blame others when a 
smaller number of pilgrims go to holy Mecca. The fact is that 
if the same number of people went on pilgrimage this year as 
1992, the government would face a most serious balance of 
payments crisis and a more rapid collapse of its currency." 
  Some observers in Tehran give a more Machiavellian 
interpretation of the conflicting signals from Khamene'i and 
Rafsanjani. 
  They that this may be a double act to cause a diplomatic 
problem to make it possible for Tehran to prevent the Iranians 
from going on pilgrimage this year, which would enable the 
government to save $2 billion at least.

<F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>
  The Year 1372 [Year beginning 21 March 1993] was a year 
replete with success for some of the countries of the world, but 
for many others, it was a year of failure and defeat. The 
successes and failures were not all similar and differences 
stemmed from the distinctive conditions prevailing in the 
respective countries. 
  However, in 1372, the United States achieved nothing but 
overt defeat. The United States began this year with 
apprehension of the future, and a bleak outlook on its strategy 
for grappling with international issues in the aftermath of the 
Cold War. In the last days of the year, most of this 
trepidation persisted and Washington's quest for adopting a 
comprehensive stand and policy on international developments has 
failed. 
  Last year, the U.S. Government's policy in foreign crises 
was 
the target of intense criticism at the domestic and 
international level. U.S. President Clinton's series of defeats 
in his interventionist policies in many countries served to 
undermine the people's trust and elicited the objections of the 
Congress against those who implement the country's foreign 
policy. 
  What is certain is that the U.S. foreign policy in the 
aftermath of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union 
continues to be based on continued interference in the internal 
affairs of all countries and proliferation of this interference. 
This objective was pursued in the period when the Republicans 
were in power and has been continued by the Democrats. 
  Regardless of the U.S. hostility toward the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, countries such as Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, 
and Haiti were the main focus of the U.S. foreign policy 
activities. As regards Iraq, the United States ignores the 
rights of the people and continues its policy of constant 
pressure and the imposition of UN sanctions and has prevented 
all kinds of balanced solutions. 
  The most conspicuous examples of the defeat of the U.S. 
interventionist policies can be more clearly perceived in 
countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. After 
a prolonged silence on the atrocities of the Serbs, and 
indifference toward the killing of 350,000 Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States sought to extricate itself 
from its political isolation by Europe and entered the fray. 
What motivated the United States to intervene was the emergence 
of conditions conducive to cooperation with Europe for 
implementing the covert plan for partitioning Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  For this purpose, the Serbs were threatened with a NATO air 
strike within a propaganda display on the one hand, and on the 
other, by means of suitable pretexts and with UN cooperation, 
the matter of any direct military intervention was ruled out. 
These actions by the United States brought new disgrace for the 
West and the United Nations both of whom profess to be defenders 
of the rights of the defenseless people of the world. 
  Another manifestation of the perplexity of U.S. foreign 
policy was in Somalia. The United States entered the arena on 
the pretext of responding to the crisis on humanitarian grounds, 
but with the passage of time, the sinister motives of the United 
States in launching these operations were apparent to all. From 
the vantage point of the U.S. military echelons, the U.S. 
military presence in the Horn of Africa was a guarantee for 
controlling the crises in this vicinity that threatened its 
interests. 
  However, with the resistance of the Muslim Somali people and 
the killing of U.S. soldiers, Washington woke up to reality and 
admitted to its vulnerability and the defeat of its policy in 
Somalia. This resulted in a withdrawal of 5000 U.S. soldiers 
from Somalia. 
  In the crisis in Haiti, U.S. foreign policy suffered a worse 
fate as the efforts by the Clinton administration in the past 
year to reinstate deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide and to convince the military rulers of the country 
failed. Initially, by coercion and in order to cover up the 
disgrace of its retreat from Somalia, the United States 
dispatched troops to Haitian shores. Right from the outset, it 
encountered the resistance of the people and the armed forces of 
that country. Ultimately, the United States forced the United 
Nations to reimpose an oil and arms embargo on the military 
government of Haiti. These sanctions were criticized vehemently 
by the people of Latin America. 
  All these crises in 1372 exposed the effete nature of U.S. 
foreign policy in such a way that, for months after the Clinton 
administration took over, the fallout continued in the form of 
the American people worrying at the trend in U.S. foreign 
policy. Last year, a CBS television poll indicated that 61 
percent of the Americans are apprehensive at the performance of 
the Clinton administration in foreign crises. 
  On the other hand, the resignations by U.S. State Department 
officials are another reflection of these fears. Some 
congressional deputies even called for Warren Christopher's 
resignation as he did not have any answer for the failure of 
such interventions. 
  In any case, facts and figures confirm that the current U.S. 
administration has no other recourse but to review the decisions 
and objectives of its foreign policy. As the WASHINGTON TIMES 
reported, Clinton has not been able to evolve a strategy for 
U.S. foreign policy in the first year of his presidency.

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, March 22 (AFP)--Syrian soldiers 
arrested at least three people carrying weapons in this eastern 
al-Biqa' Valley town on Tuesday [22 March] amid a security 
crackdown, witnesses here said. 
  A Syrian military source meanwhile declared illegal any 
attempt to carry weapons in the town. 
  Witnesses said the soldiers set up checkpoints in Ba'labakk, 
searching cars and arresting anyone with weapons. 
  The measure came 10 days after some 300 armed members of the 
Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement deployed in Ba'labakk as part 
of a demonstration by thousands of people in support of 
Jerusalem Day, in response to a call by Iran. 
  Lebanon's military prosecutor Nasri Lahhud denounced the 
presence of armed Hezbollah militants and issued warrants for 
their arrest, saying they had violated the law. 
  Some 35,000 Syrian troops are deployed in Lebanon.

  [Text] Sidon, Lebanon, March 22 (AFP)--A Palestinian denied 
in court here Tuesday [22 March] any involvement in the murder 
10 years ago of a Libyan dissident in Germany, where he is also 
wanted in connection with an anti-US attack. 
  Yasir Shuraydi, 34, who was also on trial for murders and 
other crimes committed in Lebanon, said he was not in West 
Berlin when Mustafa al-'Ashiq, a former Libyan diplomat, was 
gunned down in 1984. 
  The Palestinian worked at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin 
from 1982 until he left Germany in 1989 to return to Lebanon. 
Under Lebanese law, he can also be tried for crimes committed 
abroad. 
  He also denied any involvement in the April 5, 1986 bombing 
of the La Belle discotheque in West Berlin frequented by US 
troops. But Lebanese authorities have not charged him in 
connection with that attack. 
  Three people were killed and 230 others wounded in the 
bombing, which Washington blamed on Libya. Ten days later US 
bombers blasted the headquarters of Libyan leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli. 
  Shuraydi said the Germans suspected him of involvement in 
the 
bombing because "I am a Palestinian." 
  He had tried to recruit volunteers in Germany in 1982 to 
fight the Israeli Army which invaded Lebanon that year, he said. 
  Ghassan Ayyub, another Palestinian suspect in the murder of 
al-'Ashiq, said he had never known the Libyan, stressing that he 
had gone to Germany in 1984 seeking political asylum. 
  He fled Germany after the murder because a friend showed him 
a newspaper report which linked him and Shuraydi with 
al-'Ashiq's murder. The report was accompanied by photographs 
of both Palestinians, he added. 
  After hearing the two men for about an hour the court 
adjourned until April 19, when a verdict is expected to be 
announced. 
  Germany has demanded Shuraydi's extradition but there is no 
such agreement between Beirut and Bonn. 
  Under Lebanese law a foreigner living in Lebanon can be 
tried 
for a crime committed in this country or abroad and any 
extradition measure can only be decided by the cabinet after a 
verdict is pronounced. 
  Shuraydi, who along with Ayyub come from the 'Ayn al-Hulwah 
Palestinian refugee camp on the eastern outskirts of the port 
city of Sidon, was arrested by the Lebanese authorities in 1991 
in connection with a string of murders, attempted murder and 
burglaries.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent George Shahin from the Phalangist </F>
Headquarters in al-Sayfi on 21 March--recorded] 
  [Text] Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah said that 
the Phalangist Party still awaits the final word from the 
judiciary on the recent bombings, including the one at the 
Phalangist Party headquarters in al-Sayfi. We have not accused 
or exonerated anyone, he said. We have stressed, and still do, 
our absolute confidence in the judiciary and the security and 
military organs, foremost the Lebanese Army. Dr. Sa'adah called 
for an end to posturing, saying that such practices have been 
condemned by everyone. The Phalangist Party leader was speaking 
at an expanded meeting of the party's Political Bureau and 
Central Council, which met at 1700 today at the party's 
headquarters in al-Sayfi. 
  Dr. Sa'adah said: I have mixed feelings about what we heard 
and read in the newspapers concerning the current investigations 
in recent crimes such as the bombings at the Phalangist 
headquarters and the Sayyidat al-Najat Church. My feelings are 
a combination of satisfaction and pain. 
  My satisfaction is because the current investigation into 
these crimes has produced tangible results and promises to 
uncover the perpetrators, planners, and instigators of these 
crimes. The bombings did not only cause destruction and claim 
the lives of dear friends and devout worshipers but were also 
designed to rattle the foundation of our country and reduce it 
to a state of helplessness once more, Sa'adah announced. 
  Slogans propagating self-security and bemoaning oppression 
against one section of the Lebanese people were raised following 
these bombings, but such slogans were greeted with nothing but 
disgust in our community, Sa'adah stated. 
  Reports that the perpetrators of these crimes will be 
brought 
to justice are a cause for delight. We are pleased that this 
criminal trend will end and that our confidence in the state 
institutions, particularly the security and military, will 
remain unshaken, Sa'adah declared. 
  The Phalangist leader added: But there is pain as well, 
because we fear that a sense of humiliation may grip our 
community once the individuals and groups involved in these 
crimes are named. 
  We, in the Phalangist Party, have never lost faith in our 
beliefs. We have never accused or exonerated anyone and we are 
waiting for the judiciary to issue its final word. We have 
always had full confidence in the judiciary and the security and 
military institutions in this country, particularly the Lebanese 
Army. Our unshifting position has always been that the Army and 
judiciary should be allowed to carry out their full task without 
any hindrance at this crucial phase of the country's life, the 
Phalangist leader said. 
  Dr. Sa'adah added: On my own behalf and yours, we address a 
word of respect and admiration to the security institutions, 
foremost the Lebanese Army, for proceeding, despite accusations 
leveled to distract them from their task, to unearth all the 
facts and expose them to the public eye. 
  Our policy has always been rational. With logic and reason, 
we have assessed the matters and files laid before us. We 
issued repeated calls for calm dialogue. We even called for a 
debate to formulate an effective national policy, a call that 
has been welcomed by all except those who were only interested 
in fomenting discontent. We never complained of frustration or 
backed such complaints. We oppose attempts to manipulate our 
youth and community. We believe that the Lebanese no longer 
condone any disruptive and suicidal schemes, Sa'adah declared. 
  The Phalangist Party leader opened the meeting with 
congratulations to Lebanese mothers who, he said, deserve to 
live in dignity, stability, and happiness. He also 
congratulated, on his behalf and that of all the Phalangists, 
the elected chairman of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, 
Shaykh Muhammad Shams-al-Din, and his two deputies. Sa'adah 
praised Shams-al-Din's political judgment and patriotism. 
  Dr. Sa'adah also congratulated the Phalangist Party branches 
in Dhuq Musbih and Kasrawan-al-Futuh on the rally they organized 
last Saturday and the al-Batrun branch on the reception it 
organized yesterday to mark Mar Yusuf day. 
  Finally, the Phalangist Party leader announced that 
reconstruction work at the Phalangist headquarters is underway. 
He thanked all those who have so far participated in this 
effort, but said that more donations will be needed to finance 
this effort. 
  The Phalangist Political Bureau will hold its regular weekly 
meeting at 1900 today, with various political and party issues 
on its agenda.

  [Text] Lebanese Forces [LF] Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' has 
emphasized that the media campaign against the LF is the biggest 
falsification in the entire history of Lebanon. What is 
assuring in this falsification process, he said, is that dubious 
sources are creating this impression about the LF while the 
judiciary has not yet spoken. Furthermore, the judiciary 
sources that have been contacted asserted that all newspaper 
reports have nothing to do with the investigations. He rejected 
all detailed reports carried by newspapers and considered them 
totally untrue. He said: We will give 24-hour notice, after 
which we will be forced to resort to the normal legal measures 
against any mass media report harming the reputation of the LF. 
We will be compelled to resort to this method because the 
process took on the characteristics of defamation and slander 
and held the LF responsible for the consequences of acts with 
which the forces have nothing to do, neither closely nor 
distantly. 
  In an interview with AL-DIYAR newspaper today, Ja'ja' said: 
What is happening is that we are being subjected to a political 
harassment campaign. He noted that every party or any other 
political faction in Lebanon are subjected to the same campaign 
and that this is the whole story. 
  On the latest developments in Ghidras [where LF headquarters 
and Ja'ja's residence are situated], the LF commander said the 
atmosphere has not changed but the situation gets harder every 
now and then because the security measures taken around the LF 
headquarters in Ghidras have been stepped up to the point that 
all people coming to Ghidras are subjected to thorough 
inspection. 
  He very strongly urged the Lebanese judiciary and the 
state's 
political and military agencies to uncover all the circumstances 
and details of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church bombing and insisted 
that the trial of the criminals involved in this tragedy be 
public and open to all people and mass media. He pointed out 
that politics should not intervene in legal issues and arrest 
suspects. He noted that the security agencies say they have 
arrested the perpetrators of the massacre and thus they will 
have performed their duty in the best possible way. He said 
these agencies are supposed to have criminal evidence that 
should be turned to the judiciary which, in turn, will initiate 
a trial. He stressed that the investigations and their 
publication are the responsibility of the judicial authorities, 
not the duty of dubious sources. Noting that no LF personnel 
are in detention, he said no LF personnel are held in custody, 
at least not at present, and that what is happening is false 
accusation. The LF, he said, are subjected to the largest 
premeditated campaign of injustice and defamation in their 
history to contain the LF both politically and at the popular 
level but the results will surely be counterproductive. He said 
such methods will lead nowhere and noted that the LF are the 
victims of a process aimed at curbing political and media 
freedoms in the country.

  [Excerpts] Abdallah Kallel, the minister of state and 
interior minister, held a news conference this afternoon during 
which he announced the official results of the presidential and 
legislative elections. We give you elaborate details on this 
news conference in the following dispatch by the news department 
delegation which is now at the Interior Ministry premises. 
Colleagues Mouldi Hammami and Abdelmajid Mraihi. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kallel recalled that the election lists have been reviewed, 
and that the state had paid for the printing of the vote papers, 
and subsidized the campaigns of the parties taking part in the 
elections. Half of the grants allocated were disbursed as soon 
as the lists received the final licences, whereby all the 
candidate lists received about 200,000 dinars. It is worth 
knowing that the second half of the grant is disbursed for the 
benefit of the lists that receive 3 percent of the votes 
declared at the constituencies level, according to the 
stipulations of the law. [passage omitted] 
  The minister of state and interior minister stressed that 
abiding by the rule of law during all the phases of the 
elections had barred the way to the occurrence of breaches, 
apart from minor cases that had been dealt with on the spot. 
[passage omitted] 
  Here follow the official and final results with colleague 
Abdelmajid Mraihi: 
  [Mraihi] In fact, Abdallah Kallel gave in his news 
conference 
this afternoon the final official national results of the 
presidential and legislative elections. We recall these figures 
to you: 
  Concerning the presidential elections: 
  number of registered people: 3,150,612 
  number of voters: 2,989,880 
  number of invalid papers: 2,505 
  number of declared votes: 2,987,375 
  turnout percentage: 94.89 percent 
  percentage of valid papers: 99.91 percent 
  This was concerning the presidential elections. Regarding 
the legislative elections, the results were as follows: 
  number of registered people: 2,976,366 
  number of voters: 2,841,557 
  turnout percentage: 95.47 
  number of invalid papers: 8,686 
  number of valid papers: 2,832,871 
  The Democratic Constitutional Rally [RCD] received 2,768,667 
votes, which is 97.93 percent of the total votes cast in all the 
constituencies. The RCD received the majority of votes in all 
constituencies. Therefore, it has won all 144 seats allocated 
to constituencies. 
  Regarding the lists of the rest of the parties and the 
independent list, they received in the constituencies where they 
had candidates a total number of 64,204 votes, the breakdown of 
which follows: 
  The Movement of Social Democrats: 30,660 votes. 
  Ettajdid [Renewal] Movement: 11,299 votes. 
  The Unionist Democratic Union: 9,152 votes. 
  The Popular Unity Party: 8,391 votes. 
  The Liberal Social Party: 1,892 votes. 
  The Progressive Socialist Party: 1,749 votes. 
  The independent list in Tunis-2 Constituency: 1,061 votes. 
  The total of these votes is: 64,204. 
  By dividing the total number of these votes by the number of 
seats allocated at the national level [as opposed to the 144 
seats allocated to the constituencies, all won by the RCD], we 
get the election divider [as heard], which is 3,379.15. [The 
number of votes received by each opposition party is divided by 
3,379.15 to get the number of seats allocated to each party.] 
On the basis of this divider, the 19 seats are allocated to the 
[opposition] parties as follows: 
  The Movement of Social Democrats: 10 seats. 
  Ettajdid Movement: 4 seats. 
  The Unionist Democratic Union: 3 seats. 
  The Popular Unity Movement: 2 seats. 
  No seats for: the Progressive Socialist Party, the Liberal 
Social Party, the independent list in Tunis-2 Constituency. 
  By referring to the results registered by the lists of each 
party at the constituencies level, and on the basis of the order 
of the percentage received by each one of these lists, seats 
have been allocated to each party according to Article 105B of 
the Electoral Code as follows: 
  The Movement of Social Democrats won 10 seats that have been 
allocated to the top of its list in the following 
constituencies: Tozeur, Nabeul, Tunis-2, 
Gabes, Jendouba, Ben Arous, Medenine, Sfax-2, Sidi Bouzid, and 
Ariana. 
  Therefore, the total of its seats is 10. 
  The Renewal Movement won four seats that have been allocated 
to the top of its list in the following constituencies: Mahdia, 
Tunis-2, Nabeul, and Gafsa. 
  The Unionist Democratic Union won three seats that have been 
allocated to the top of its list in the the following 
constituencies: Gafsa, Kebili, and Sfax-2. 
  The Popular Unity Party won two seats that have been 
allocated to the top of its list in the following 
constituencies: Monastir and Sousse. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of 
the Islamic State of Afghanistan, answered the questions of 
foreign journalists on the current situation in the country in a 
news conference held this afternoon. A BIA [BAKHTAR INFORMATION 
AGENCY] correspondent told us that the news conference was 
attended by correspondents of foreign news agencies. 
  At the beginning, Rabbani spoke about the social and 
political situation of the country and the peace-seeking policy 
of Afghanistan. The esteemed president said: The policy of 
Afghanistan is a peaceful policy. The state and the people of 
Afghanistan do not want fighting. Those whose interests are 
linked with fighting want fighting. We want peace to be 
restored very soon because no issue can be resolved by pressure 
and force. Rabbani also shed light on the peace-seeking 
measures of the Islamic state. 
  The president then answered the foreign journalists' 
questions. Answering a question, Rabbani said: We want a large 
gathering to be convened by the people in order that the future 
leadership of the country be elected, and in the current 
conditions the state cannot leave the scene vacant. Answering 
another question, our country's esteemed president said: The 
state makes many efforts for a permanent cease-fire. We do not 
want the fighting to continue, but unfortunately a large part of 
the causes of fighting emanate from abroad.

<F P=106> [Address by President Farooq Ahmad Leghari at the Pakistan </F>
Day military parade at Jinnah Avenue in Islamabad -- live] 
  [Text] Brigadier Oragzai, commander of the joint parade of 
the Armed Forces; officers, junior commissioned officers, 
crusaders, and my dear compatriots: Peace be upon you. 
Greetings to you on the Pakistan Day. I feel proud to address 
this joint parade of the armed forces, which is the most 
magnificent ceremony of Pakistan Day. On this auspicious day of 
Pakistan Day, the Muslims of the subcontinent pledged that they 
would create a separate independent homeland for the defense of 
their religion, history, traditions, and their own national 
identity. This commitment of ours has had the support of 
Almighty God. That is why we were fortunate to have a 
sagacious, sincere, and resolute leader like Qaide Azam Mohammad 
Ali Jinnah, under whose unprecedented leadership we reached our 
destination. But let me remind you that this boon of freedom 
was achieved through the great sacrifices of hundreds of 
thousands of Muslims. On this day, we bow our heads to God in 
thanksgiving while paying tributes to the Qaide Azam Mohammad 
Ali Jinnah, saluting our martyrs, and making a pledge that we 
will defend this trust and the sacred motherland of Pakistan. 
We will work relentlessly and not hesitate to make any 
sacrifice for the country's strength. The armed forces are 
proud that the sacred responsibility of defending the country 
lies with them. Our soldiers, navy men, and airmen are experts 
in the military arts and are the embodiments of sacrifice and 
bravery. Today's glorious parade reflects their professional 
standard. The resolute faces of the officers and soldiers 
taking part in the parade manifest their morale, enthusiasm, and 
spirit. These are those holy warriors who, every second, are 
ready to face any danger facing the country and who are ever 
willing to directly confront the enemy's designs. The nation has 
full confidence in their military capability and bravery. 
Whether in times of war or peace, they are always ready to 
respond to the call of duty. They have manifested dutifulness, 
performance, devotion, and sacrifice in the face of natural 
calamities and all kinds of emergencies. Through their bravery, 
determination, enthusiasm, and self- sacrifice, they have 
conquered all adversities. We are sure that they will also 
overcome any test in the future and will maintain their glorious 
traditions. 
  Sometime back, the armed forces were given the duty of 
assisting in holding the general elections in a peaceful 
atmosphere and in an impartial and orderly manner. The task was 
of national importance, which they performed with such 
excellence that all political parties and national and 
international observers commended them. 
  For the last one and half years, our Army has been assisting 
the provincial government to restore law and order and to uproot 
crime in Sindh. As a result of the industrious action in this 
connection, the law and order situation has improved and it is 
now hoped that in the future a common citizen will be able to 
live in a peaceful atmosphere. 
  Our brave officers and soldiers are serving valiantly in 
the icy Siachen region -- the highest battleground of the world 
-- and are risking their lives to discharge their duty to defend 
the country. Their morale, determination and steadfastness in 
this extremely inhospitable region are proof of their role as 
holy warriors and reflect our glorious military traditions. 
  Similarly, along the hundreds of miles of the line of 
control 
in Kashmir, our holy warriors -- indifferent to the serious 
weather conditions and difficulties of the mountainous region -- 
are devoted to foiling the enemy's designs and discharging their 
defensive duties in the forward areas. The effective defense of 
the motherland is on top of the present government's priorities. 
Despite the financial constraints faced by the country and the 
burden of the socioeconomic problems, the Pakistan Government 
attaches great importance to defense requirements because the 
country's stability and an atmosphere conducive to socioeconomic 
progress largely depend on an effective defense. It is our 
commitment that regardless of all difficulties and all types of 
internal and external pressures, we will continue our efforts to 
make our defense stronger and stronger. An estimate of the 
danger facing our country can be made by viewing the accelerated 
military expenditures and preparations being carried out in our 
neighboring country. In view of these dangers, we have no 
alternative but to pay full attention to our defense. The 
security of the country and a strong defense are our top foreign 
policy objectives. We are using our diplomatic and 
international connections for this purpose and promoting 
cooperation with friendly countries in the economic as well as 
in the defense field to the maximum possible extent. 
  We want to maintain cordial relations with the entire world 
in general and with the Muslim and neighboring states in 
particular on the basis of equality and national dignity. To us, 
lasting peace is based on faith in coexistence, respect for each 
country's territorial integrity and sovereignty, refraining from 
interfering in others' internal affairs and not indulging in 
fostering designs to establish hegemony in any region, 
especially regarding small neighboring countries. We ourselves 
do not have any aggressive designs against any country, nor do 
we want to occupy anyone's territory, hurt its just national 
interests, or establish dominance over states in our region. 
We want to see this principle practiced in the foreign policy 
of our neighboring countries because in any region relations 
based on peace and friendship and tension-free ties depend on 
implementing these principles. Thank God, we enjoy cordial 
relations with all countries of the world. We enjoy deep 
fraternal ties with all Muslim countries in our region. We 
enjoy exemplary relations with the people's Republic of China, 
and we are proud of these ties. We also enjoy deep and fruitful 
relations with the South Asian states. 
  We want to establish similar relations with our close 
eastern 
neighbor, but the Kashmir issue is a fundamental obstacle in the 
path of normal relations. The only solution to this issue is 
for the Kashmiri people to exercise the right of 
self-determination given to them in accordance with the 1947 
Indian partition plan, the UN resolutions, and international 
law. Unfortunately, our neighbor is yet not aware of this 
reality. However, the Kashmiri people's unprecedented uprising 
and their spirit of freedom, courage, determination, and 
sacrifice is rudely awakening people's consciences. That is why 
the day is not far off when, like Muslims of other parts of the 
subcontinent, Kashmiri people will also achieve their 
inalienable right of self-determination. The Kashmiri uprising 
has entered a decisive stage. The Pakistani Government and 
people are behind the oppressed Kashmiri people and will 
continue to extend full political, diplomatic and moral support 
to them. 
  Pakistan is not only our motherland, but also a strong 
fortress of Islam, by the grace of God. In this way, certain 
responsibilities fall on our shoulders. We are grateful to God 
that He has granted us the will and the divine guidance under 
which we are fulfilling our responsibilities toward the Islamic 
community according to our capability. 
  We enjoy deep Islamic fraternal relations with Afghanistan. 
We have supported our Afghan brethren to the best of our 
ability in their historic struggle against foreign aggression. 
Now, we pray to God for an early establishment of peace and 
tranquillity in Afghanistan so that our brotherly country can 
march toward peace and reconciliation and progress and 
prosperity. 
  An Islamic country which is facing foreign aggression 
because 
of the apathy of the international community and where human 
rights, international law, the UN resolutions, and the 
recognized principles of justice are being mercilessly violated 
is Bosnia. As a member of the United Nations and in view of our 
Islamic ties, we are aggrieved at the brutalities being 
committed against the people of Bosnia and are raising our voice 
against them at all international forums. The Bosnian problem 
is a glaring example of the international community's double 
standard. Like Somalia, where our troops are offering great 
sacrifices to maintain law and order and to ensure the continued 
supply of international aid to its people under the leadership 
of the United Nations, we are ready to assist the United Nations 
in protecting the besieged and unarmed people of Bosnia and 
establishing peace there. Pakistan is supporting and providing 
practical assistance to the UN efforts to establish peace in 
different regions of the world. The record of services rendered 
by the Pakistani forces in this regard is excellent. Only 
recently, our troops returned home after performing their duties 
regarding the conducting of elections and the restoration of 
democracy in Cambodia after the establishment of peace in that 
country. The manner in which their superior performance has 
been admired at international level is a matter of great pride 
for us. I congratulate our brave armed forces for this. A 
strong defense is deeply related to law and order, economic 
progress, and social justice. We cannot strengthen our defense 
without strengthening our economy and scientific, technical, and 
industrial development. Under the conditions of a weak economy 
and educational backwardness, we can neither achieve 
self-sufficiency in the field of arms manufacturing nor provide 
the required resources to the defense sector. Therefore, your 
government is making concrete, comprehensive, and coordinated 
efforts to accelerate the pace of the country's economic 
development, to generate maximum opportunities for employment, 
and to provide education and health care facilities to the 
majority of the population. Several task forces have been set 
up for this purpose. In accordance with the recommendations of 
these task forces, legislations are being enacted and a new 
administrative structure is being set up; in addition, the 
implementation of the economic development program in all 
spheres of life is going on at full swing. Under the new Social 
Contract program of the elected popular government, the people 
are being provided with social justice and civic amenities, 
their due shares in economic and educational development, and 
human rights. This will not only create a new awakening among 
our people, but will also create a new spirit and enthusiasm, 
besides increasing their productivity and the country's gross 
production; and the nation will march forward on the path of 
prosperity. In this manner, the (?government) will play an 
important role in ensuring the progress of our hard-working, 
sincere, and patriotic people and in strengthening the defense 
of the motherland and the security of the nation. 
  Today's grand parade, in which not only our valiant forces 
but also the four provinces are participating with the 
variegated colors of their respective cultures and economies, is 
a symbol of our nation's bright and promising future. I 
congratulate the organizers of this parade and compliment the 
officers, leaders of the marching contingents, and soldiers. 
May God help and protect you! Long live the armed forces of 
Pakistan! Long Live Pakistan!

<F P=106> [Studio talk between anchorman Hayim Yavin and political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik] 
  [Text] [Yavin] We now return to the political process. 
Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik is in the studio. The 
consultations between the prime minister and the delegation 
which returned today from Tunis are continuing. Is there any 
chance of either a summit meeting or the resumption of the 
talks? Are there any new decisions, Gadi? 
  [Sukenik] Yes. The consultations are still under way here 
and in Tunis but the picture that is forming appears to be quite 
positive. Rabin received an optimistic briefing from the 
members of the Israeli delegation. Here are the facts: Rabin 
apparently agrees to an international presence in Hebron as 
demanded by the Palestinians, as well as to the immediate 
deployment of a Palestinian police force. The quantities, 
weapons, and all the other details still have to be worked out 
tomorrow in Cairo. Rabin definitely rejects an armed UN 
presence in Hebron and insists that everything remain under 
Israeli control. 
  The delegation, composed of the same members -- Deputy Chief 
of Staff Amnon Shahaq, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri 
Savir, Prime Minister Rabin's adviser Jacques Neriya, and legal 
adviser Yo'el Zinger -- will leave tomorrow afternoon for Cairo. 
Most importantly, the Norwegians are at this very moment 
sending out invitations to a conference scheduled to take place 
in Cairo on 24 March for all the countries that are supposed to 
be contributing to the autonomy institutions. If everything 
goes smoothly and rapid progress is made in the discussions, PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will attend this conference and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres will also most likely show up. The two 
men will hold a summit meeting and then practical negotiations 
on the implemention of the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho will resume at the 
beginning of next week. 
  [Yavin] Thank you, Gadi Sukenik.

pushing the peace process forward toward its target.

  [Text] Tehran, March 22, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Ministry 
today denied allegations that the Iranian C-130 plane which 
crashed near Karabakh region was on a spying mission. 
  ITAR-TASS news agency had earlier indicated that there was a 
possibility that C-130 was involved in a spying mission. 
  Mahmud Mohammadi, a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, 
told IRNA today that his ministry categorically rejected such 
allegations. 
  "It is a pity that at a time when the people of Iran are 
mourning the death of the victims of this crash, such baseless 
and false reports are broadcast by ITAR-TASS news agency," 
Mohammadi said. 
  The C-130 plane en route from Moscow to Tehran was carrying 
the family members of the Iranian foreign service associated 
with the Iranian diplomatic mission in Moscow.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--The Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations began in Cairo this evening. The Palestinian 
delegation is led by Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and the Israeli delegation 
is led by Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Amnon Shahaq. 
  In a statement to correspondents before the negotiations, 
Dr. 
Sha'th said: We came here to avoid another massacre in Hebron. 
  Uri Savir, Israeli Foreign Ministry director general and a 
member of the Israeli delegation, said: The delegation held 
extremely good negotiations in Tunis and we are continuing our 
negotiations in Cairo. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations 
will try to reach agreement on international protection for the 
Palestinians living under occupation with a view to resuming the 
negotiations to implement the self-rule agreement in Gaza and 
Jericho first. These negotiations were suspended after the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron on 25 February. Dr. 
Sha'th expected the Israeli delegation to provide answers to 
proposals made the day before yesterday in Tunis during the 
negotiations between the two delegations. 
  He added: The negotiations in Tunis made some progress and 
we expect to hear what the Israeli delegation has to provide in 
the way of answers. 
  Dr. Sha'th said: We want a speedy implementation of the UN 
Security Council resolution on protecting the Palestinians. 
  Diplomatic sources in Cairo said that if an understanding is 
reached on the protection of the Palestinians in the occupied 
territory during the session of negotiations tonight, a meeting 
between Palestinian President 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres could be held during the next 24 hours to 
pave the way for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. 
  There were reports that 'Arafat and Peres are expected to 
meet in Paris tomorrow, Thursday.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak today 
received a letter from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated this after receiving the 
letter during his meeting today with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser. 
  Musa said he and Dr. Sha'th discussed recent developments 
from the Palestinian and Israeli points of views and the 
situation in Hebron. 
  On the other hand, Dr. Sha'th stated that he has come to 
Cairo to continue the negotiations started in Tunis to insure 
the speedy implementation of the Security Council resolution 
[904] and provide the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab 
territories, especially in Hebron, with protection in view of 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  He noted that today's meetings, as well as the conference 
for 
supporting the Palestinian police that will begin in Cairo 
tomorrow, will focus on providing safety and security for the 
Palestinian people, particularly in Hebron. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian delegation under his 
chairmanship and the Israeli delegation under the chairmanship 
of Amnon Shahaq, the Israeli chief of staff, will hold a meeting 
later today to resume the Tunis negotiations on implementing the 
Security Council resolution and insuring protection for the 
Palestinian people. 
  He added that tomorrow's meeting is to decide on the number 
of Palestinian policemen needed to keep the peace in the 
Palestinian territories. It has become clear after the Hebron 
massacre that there is a dire need for Palestinian policemen who 
are capable of establishing security. 
  Sha'th described the Security Council resolution on the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre as good, despite the U.S. 
reservations. 
  He said it is the first resolution that provides certain 
elements of international protection for the Palestinian people. 
It asks the Israeli side to provide protection to the 
Palestinian people. 
  On Israel's proposal to provide an international presence in 
the occupied territories by extending the term of 
representatives from the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief 
and Works Agency in the occupied territories, Sha'th said that 
the presence of these two organizations does not obviate the 
need for international presence as stipulated in the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the Security Council 
resolution. He noted the continued suffering of the people in 
Hebron, who have curfews imposed on them.

  [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff 
and head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with the PLO in 
Cairo, has said that the sides have not reached agreement even 
on one of the issues on the agenda. There is a gap in the 
positions of the sides, and the discussions will continue today, 
he asserted. 
  Replying to a question by our correspondent in Cairo Arye 
Gus, Maj. Gen. Shahaq said the atmosphere in the talks was 
normal. He added that the operation against terrorists in 
Hebron yesterday had nothing to do with the ongoing talks with 
the PLO. It is a terrorist event, and we will fight terror 
wherever it is uncovered, he stated. 
  Our correspondent has learned that the discussions are 
currently centered on the number of foreign observers to be 
deployed in Hebron, the size of the future police force, and who 
will command it. Israel opposes the Palestinian demand to set 
up a force of no less than 1,000 [as heard] troops. Our 
correspondent adds that Israel will apparently not object to 
having the international observers carry guns for self-defense.

  [Editorial Report] The following review of the 18 March 
issue of Cairo AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in 
nature. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Hebron Killings Condemned, Speakers Assail Jews, U.S. 
  2. Israeli Mosad Accused of Involvement in Monastery 
Attack 
  3. Writer Denounces Monastery Attack, Israel, Government 
Policy 
  4. Iraqi Minister Says Arabs, Muslims To Blame for 
Sufferings 
  5. SLP Official Denounces Government Policy, Demands 
Change 
  6. Muslim Brotherhood Denounces Clinton's Remarks on 
Jerusalem 
<H5>  HEBRON KILLINGS CONDEMNED, SPEAKERS ASSAIL JEWS, U.S. </H5>
  The 18 March issue of AL-SHA'B continues to report protests 
against and denunciation of the Hebron killings and denunciation 
of the Jews and the United States during 'Id al-Fitr prayers in 
various parts of the country. It devotes part of the front page 
and all of page 3 to detailed accounts of demonstrations and 
sermons by Islamic leaders who condemn the "massacre," criticize 
Arab leaders' weakness, and call for breaking off the 
negotiations with Israel and for a jihad. The paper notes that 
security authorities surrounded many of the places of worship 
and took precautionary measures to guard against further 
demonstrations in many governorates. Worshipers chanted slogans 
against the Zionist entity and carried banners demanding revenge 
against the "criminal Zionists." Islamists took part in 
demonstrations protesting against the "Jewish delinquency" and 
weakness of the Islamic rulers. At the Mustafa Mahmud Mosque 
Square, Socialist Liberal Party [SLP] members and thousands of 
worshipers chanted slogans against the Jews and demanded that 
relations with the Zionists be severed. SLP members burned and 
trampled over the Israeli flag with their shoes and distributed 
a statement released by the Youths Federation on the "Jewish 
criminality" and the government's weakness. 
  The Muslim Brothers organized demonstrations in Hulwan, 
chanting revolutionary slogans against the Jews and their 
agents. The paper reports that prayers were held in Upper Egypt 
under the threat of weapons and that the Central Security Forces 
surrounded the places of worship. 
  In an approximately 270-word report on page 3 about 'Id 
al-Fitr prayers in Tanta, the paper says over 20,000 worshipers 
packed the sports stadium in Tanta amid a strict security 
blockade and that they were joined by women and children. In 
his sermon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Salamah, professor and dean of 
the Koran interpretation branch at Umm-al-Qura University in 
Mecca, Saudi Arabia, focused on the Jews' "treachery" and 
"affirmed that America is the leader and protector of terrorism 
in the entire world." He criticized the Security Council and 
reviewed the tolerance of Islam and the prophet. Over 60,000 
worshipers gathered at 'Abd-al-Halim Square, chanting the 
slogans: "O Jerusalem, we are returning" and "Muhammad's army 
will return." 
  In an approximately 190-word report on the same page on 
events in Alexandria by 'Amir 'Id, the author says masses of 
worshipers staged marches and chanted slogans denouncing the 
"Zionist carnage," the "languor" of Arab and Islamic regimes, 
and the Security Council's "collusion." In his sermon, Shaykh 
Ahmad al-Mahallawi noted the need to apply the Islamic shari'ah 
and involving Islam in the battle with the Jews. He said that 
Islam is "inevitably coming" and it will lead the world, 
provided that "we stick to the injunctions of God's book." He 
strongly criticized the secularists' domination of intellect and 
mass media, which make them smear "everything." In western 
Alexandria, placards denounced the "Zionist massacre" and 
criticized the government's stance on veiled women and 
transferring them to desk jobs. 
  Muhammad Hilal files an approximately 240-word report on 
page 3 on sermons in Kafr al-Shaykh. A mosque imam, Shaykh 
Faraj Zaki Faraj, denounces the Arabs' "languor toward the 
Muslim causes, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina and occupied 
Palestine." The report says the imam asks every worshiper to 
imagine he has a sister being raped in Bosnia and a brother 
being killed in Palestine, as was the case in the Hebron 
massacre, and that everyone should react accordingly. 
  An approximately 260-word report on events in al-Suways on 
the same page says al-Suways inhabitants lived the night 
preceding 'Id al-Fitr in a state of fear and panic as police 
forces deployed in the streets in a provocative manner and that 
policemen pointed the muzzles of their rifles at passersby. The 
Hebron massacre was the main theme of 'Id al-Fitr sermons. 
Islamic preacher Shaykh Hafiz Salamah said the massacre proved 
that the Arab governments participating in the peace talks are 
living in a state of "falseness and prevarication." The reports 
adds: "Shaykh Salamah stressed that jihad is the only way to 
liberate the Islamic land of Palestine, to establish its 
independent state, and to avenge the blood of the martyrs who 
fell as they kneeled before God while performing the dawn 
prayer." 
  Another 200-word report on the same page from the Aswan 
correspondent indicates that the security authorities flooded 
public squares with water, forcing the 'Id al-Fitr speakers to 
stay away from these squares. 
  In an approximately 1,500-word report on page 2, the paper 
reports SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri's speech at the party's 
conference on 28 Ramadan in which Shukri criticizes the Security 
Council for being unable to take a stand denouncing the Hebron 
killings. He criticizes the Egyptian Government, which 
"trampled over al-Azhar with the feet of its security men who 
threw bombs at its campus and arrested worshipers just because 
they wanted to say prayers for the souls of their brother 
martyrs of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque." He also criticizes the 
government's ban on demonstrations and its "loyalty" to Israel. 
Discussing domestic issues, Shukri also criticizes the 
Constitution and government policies. 
<H5>  ISRAELI MOSAD ACCUSED OF INVOLVEMENT IN MONASTERY ATTACK </H5>
  In an approximately 760-word report on pages 1 and 7 on a 
recent attack on a Coptic monastery in Upper Egypt, the 18 March 
edition of AL-SHA'B cites "Asyut leaders" as denouncing the 
attack and indicating that Israeli Mosad intelligence agency 
personnel were involved in the incident to foment sectarian 
feuds between Muslims and Copts. 
<H5>  WRITER DENOUNCES MONASTERY ATTACK, ISRAEL, GOVERNMENT POLICY </H5>
  In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 2, the 
author, 
Mahfuz 'Azzam, denounces a recent attack on a Coptic monastery 
in Upper Egypt, discusses the Hebron killings and a recent 
church bombing in Lebanon, and implicates Israel in the latter 
incident, citing other writers on the subject. 
  Commenting on the attack on the monastery in Egypt, he says: 
"In the name of every Muslim in this country, we announce our 
condemnation of this heinous crime no matter who did it. We 
emphasize the belief of the SLP and the entire Islamic 
movement--and indeed all the Muslims in Egypt, parties and 
groups--that any attack on a church or mosque is an aggression 
against this nation. We vehemently reject any bigotry against 
our brother Copts as we reject any bigotry against Muslims." 
  He says that the Israeli Government, "which is established 
on 
treachery, aggression, and usurpation of the Palestinian land" 
has a genuine interest in distracting attention from the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque "massacre." He notes that while Israel is 
engaged in oppression, murder, violence, and terrorism, the 
president and officials in Egypt declare the need for 
normalization, dialogue, and peace with Israel despite Israel's 
countless crimes. This, he adds, takes place at a time when the 
president and his government refuse the principle of dialogue 
with the sons of this nation, whom they accused of violating the 
law and committing violence and terrorism. 

<H3>    IRAQI MINISTER SAYS ARABS, MUSLIMS TO BLAME FOR 
SUFFERINGS </H3>
  Page 4 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 1,500-word 
report filed by Salah Budaywi on the hardship of the Iraqi 
people in light of UN sanctions, the high cost of living, 
soaring prices, and the government's food rationing, citing the 
views of many ordinary citizens. 
  The correspondent says the Security Council has authorized 
each individual country in the world to do what it deems fit 
about releasing Iraqi frozen assets for the purchase of food and 
medicine and notes that the Arab and Islamic governments should 
have responded to that resolution and released $4 billion in 
Iraqi assets frozen at their banks. But, citing Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf in response to AL-SHA'B's 
question, the correspondent says the Arab and Islamic 
governments regrettably are still ignoring this situation. The 
Iraqi foreign minister is quoted as saying: "Government 
leaders, such as those in Spain, Switzerland, and two other 
European countries, relented and released the Iraqi assets." 
Therefore, the report continues, he [the Iraqi minister] 
believes that the main cause of the continuation of the Iraqis' 
suffering is currently an Arab-Islamic one. 
<H5>  SLP OFFICIAL DENOUNCES GOVERNMENT POLICY, DEMANDS CHANGE </H5>
  In an approximately 3,000-word article on page 5, SLP deputy 
leader 'Adil Husayn deplores the Egyptian Government's 
cooperation and "collusion" with the United States and Israel in 
plots against the Somali and Sudanese peoples. In the 
introduction, he says: "Rulers in most of the Arab and Islamic 
countries, of course led by the rulers in Egypt, now publicly 
and without shame violate the Koran's text. Through their 
control of the modern media, especially the television, these 
rulers seek to delude the nation into following their depravity 
and forgetting God's commandments." 
  He discusses at length the Egyptian Government's contacts 
and 
cooperation with Sudanese opposition and the government's stance 
against an Islamic regime in Sudan, citing the Sudanese 
opposition's meetings in Cairo and the United States' and other 
countries' plans to partition Sudan. He says: "We are 
confident of God's support of the believers and know that the 
accomplishments in Sudan under the banner of "No god but God" 
have made Sudan secure in its food and necessary needs. What is 
more important is that the spirit of jihad has covered the 
Sudanese nation, which is now able to put up with its 
affliction." He adds: "With the rush to martyrdom, the Army 
and the popular defense, which include southerners, now have 
full control over all the national soil. Therefore, the 
Westerners have lost their cool and have raised their shrill 
voice and threats in the past months to intervene directly to 
partition the south and its surroundings, now that the rebellion 
has failed to fulfill this mission and the rebellion leaders 
have taken refuge abroad." 
  Generally he praises the Islamic regime in Sudan and 
denounces the Egyptian Government's policies toward Somalia and 
Sudan in collaboration with the United States and Israel. 
  After noting the Egyptian Government's role in Somalia in 
implementation of "Washington's orders," he addresses that 
government, saying: "What a bad deal, through which you will 
lose this world and the world hereafter. But don't ever go near 
Sudan and conclude a similar deal on it with the United States. 
If you think you can do something of the sort, I refer you to 
Almighty God's open commandment and prohibitions. If these 
injunctions are not obligatory for you, they are binding to us. 
In the name of these injunctions, our people will not agree to 
fight Sudan to obey the Americans and the Jews because this 
nation raises the banner of Islam with all its meanings of 
piety, strength, and might. This nation will fight you if you 
seek to embroil it." 
  At one point, he states that the Arabs have lost a great 
deal 
through their alliance with the United States in the war against 
Iraq and that the Gulf States were the first losers. 
  Concluding, the author says that he has written the article 
on Thursday morning before going to the State Security 
Prosecution for investigation because, in his words, he is 
charged with incitement against the government and with trying 
to bring it down. 
  He says: "I hereby declare to the nation that our entire 
party admits that it indeed encouraged and will continue to 
encourage the changing of rulers because this is the only way to 
improve the situation. There must be a strong and honest 
government and we want a peaceful change through elections. Do 
whatever you wish to us but we will continue to do our duty and 
will not fear your threats. Sufficient unto us is God." 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DENOUNCES CLINTON'S REMARKS ON JERUSALEM </H5>
  An approximately 140-word report on page 7 says that the 
Muslim Brotherhood has issued a statement denouncing U.S. 
President Clinton's remarks that Jerusalem will remain the 
eternal capital of Israel, and emphasizing that Clinton's 
statements represent a continuation of the "Zionist enemy's" 
racist settlement policy. 
  The statement says: "The Islamic nations regard with extreme 
anger the U.S. Administration's stances disparaging the Muslims' 
right to Palestine and holy Jerusalem. The complete silence of 
the Islamic world's governments, kings, and presidents is met 
with bad and bitter responses from the Arab and Islamic peoples." 
  The Muslim Brotherhood, the report says, urged the Islamic 
nation to denounce the U.S. stance on the Palestinian issue and 
"show popular anger at that stance, which is partial to the 
Zionist enemy."

<F P=106> ["Text" of message from PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat, identified by his nom de guerre Abu-'Ammar, to 
the Palestinian people; place and date not given--read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. So lose not heart, nor fall into despair; for ye must 
gain mastery if ye are true in faith. If a wound hath touched 
you, be sure a similar wound hath touched the others, such days 
of varying fortunes we give to men and men by turns. [Koranic 
verses] 
  Brothers, family, our struggling masses, and our 
revolutionaries and mujahidin: I address you to express my 
appreciation and that of your brothers in the Palestinian 
leadership for your superb steadfastness and courageous stand, 
which has shown the great qualities of our people, especially at 
this time of calamity and hardship. 
  After the ugly massacre committed by the murderous settlers 
and the occupying army, our entire people stood up to defend 
their presence, their sacred places, and their dignity, as well 
as the hope they hold in their hearts as they wait for the 
moment the ugly Israeli occupation ends and the national 
authority materializes, leading the way to the establishment of 
the independent Palestinian state, with its capital our holy 
Jerusalem. 
  I address you in sincere and clear words; the words of those 
who kept the trust and, at the same time, put their life at 
risk, to enable our people to win their future, freedom, 
dignity, and independence. 
  With all brotherly feelings and frankness, I emphasize to 
you 
the importance of standing fast in these critical days. We 
should turn a blind eye to what some people are trying to do by 
spreading programmed rumors and a climate of despair. 
  I tell you very frankly that we are facing one of our 
fiercest battles at a time when our people, under the PLO, are 
banging, with all their strength, on the doors of independence 
and freedom. It comes at a time when the world community is 
looking forward to seeing the realization of the Palestinians' 
rights amidst all the successive events. 
  It is also one of a series of battles that we have not 
stopped fighting since the first bullet was fired on 1 January 
1965. These battles were crowned by the start of the great 
national intifadah, which is continuing and growing, and which 
will continue to escalate until our peoples's objectives are 
realized; that is, until the occupation is terminated and the 
independence and freedom of our people, territory, and sacred 
places are realized. 
  The settlements were one of the obstacles that we faced, and 
are still facing, in our negotiations with the Israelis. The 
world community and the international resolutions support us in 
this regard and consider the settlements an obstacle in the path 
of peace. Therefore, we were always certain that these 
settlements would finally be dismantled and the settlers would 
leave our land. What is founded on myths is basically wrong. 
Events have confirmed the soundness of our position. The world 
has also become aware of the seriousness of this matter. 
Disarming the settlers has now become a basic starting point 
for dismantling settlements and removing them from our territory. 
  With the cooperation between units from the Israeli Army and 
the armed settlers, we are facing the same situation that faced 
our Algerian brothers during the first and second Lausanne 
Talks. We faced this dilemma in the same way we faced other 
dilemmas in the past. They only strengthened our beliefs and 
convictions in the justness of our cause. Therefore, we 
underlined this position, which is dictated by the national 
responsibility, and emphasized the need to provide international 
protection for our people and forced the world community to face 
its responsibility as regards this dreadful scheme. 
  While we were fighting a diplomatic battle in the Security 
Council to obtain a UN resolution and discussing among the 
Palestinian leadership the ways to run that battle, certain 
professionals in stirring seditions were sowing the seeds of 
suspicion, passing false judgments, and writing false 
statements. We did not pay any attention to their falsehoods 
because we have always avoided being pushed into side battles 
and we have always believed, and still believe, that the battle 
is with the occupying enemy. The battle revolves around the 
basic contradiction with the occupiers, it is not aimed at 
creating confusion, which is the dream of the enemies of the 
Palestinian people, the Palestinian homeland, and the 
Palestinian presence. Do not call each other by offensive 
nicknames. [Koranic verse] 
  I tell you, brothers, that we have shouldered the trust, 
and taken the pledge and the vow--the pledge of the pious 
martyrs and their vow. To honor our responsibility, we must 
firmly face all tests and trials and their fierceness should 
increase our firmness, faith, and determination. In moments of 
trial and challenge we must all stand as one with one aim. We 
must think of our responsibilities and search for all means of 
confrontation, including the assistance of public opinion and 
the bodies of international legitimacy, particularly the UN 
Security Council and the international and Arab bodies such as 
the Arab League, the Nonaligned Movement, the Organization of 
African Unity, the Islamic Conference Organization, and all 
friends in the world. 
  We fought fierce battles in the Hebron massacre, the 
Jerusalem and 'Ayn Qarah [Rishon LeZiyyon] massacres, as well as 
the Sabra and Shatillah and Dayr Yasin massacres, and the 
difficult confrontations in Janin and Rafah, the Triangle area, 
Galilee, Nazareth, and the Negev. 
  We have stopped the negotiations with the Israelis and have 
clearly announced that they will not be resumed before our 
people have obtained all guarantees to provide international 
protection for them and before the powder keg of the 
settlements, which is threatening the peace process, is removed 
and the perpetrators of the murders have been punished. The 
battle will not stop at this stage. We have many other details 
and our agenda contains fateful issues that require just 
solutions so that just peace can be established. 
  One of the urgent issues is the question of our detained 
brothers in the prisons of occupation. We will neither sleep 
nor rest until all of them win their freedom so that they can 
participate in the battle of building our national authority and 
independent state. We have resolutely refused all enemy 
attempts to categorize or classify them and refused the release 
of the Fatah detainees alone, despite the fact that they form 
the majority of the detainees. We insisted that all must be 
treated in the same way because they are the beloved sons of 
Palestine. 
  At these difficult moments, I appeal to you to stand united 
to confront this new situation. I ask our people everywhere to 
close ranks, realize national unity, and keep their hearts 
united at moments of difficulty and trial. We are a people of 
martyrs, revolutionaries, and mujahidin. I ask our people to 
expel all instigators of sedition and divisions from their 
ranks. Despite this darkness, the light of dawn is coming. The 
dawn and victory are coming. This ugly repression by the 
occupation authorities and their settlers remind us of the 
repression, tyranny, and killing that usually intensifies just 
before peoples win their independence. One salient example come 
to mind at this moment -- the movement launched in Algeria by 
the hardline French settlers and their supporters from the 
military on the eve of Algerian independence. We must learn 
these lessons and understand these signs and defeat the Israelis 
extremists who are trying to hinder our triumphant march toward 
independence and an independent state whose capital will be holy 
Jerusalem. That even the apostle and those of faith who were 
with him cried: When will come the help of God? Ah, verily the 
help of God is always near. [Koranic verse] 
  Brothers and sisters, our struggling people. The Israeli 
authorities are continuing the same policy despite agreements 
signed with them to begin a new phase on the way to establishing 
a just peace. The Israeli soldiers are continuing their 
repression, attacks, and crimes, firing at children, women, and 
the elderly. In this way, Israel has continued to violate the 
Declaration of Principles. We have the right to seek all 
legitimate means of response and to look for all prospects that 
suit us to foil the attempts of circles hostile to peace in the 
Israeli military establishment and the armed settlers--circles 
that have had free rein to spread destruction and anarchy in 
their attempts to stop the wheels of history. We genuinely want 
peace, but we reject capitulation. 
  We seek a just peace and will not submit or surrender. We 
will not transform the peace agreement into an agreement of 
submission. I tell you that the Palestinian blood will not be 
cheap. This blood ignited the torch of our struggle and 
jihad--a torch that will not be smothered, with God's help. In 
honor of this blood, we will adopt all measures and stands 
required by our people's supreme national interests. We greet 
all the steadfast people in Hebron and in all parts of our 
beloved homeland. Greetings from revolutionaries to 
revolutionaries, the pledge of free men to free men. 
  On the eighth day of this month, the world celebrated 
international women's day while the Palestinian women stood 
firmly amid fire, bidding farewell to the martyrs and facing the 
occupiers' bullets and repression with indignation, sacrifices, 
and martyrdom. We greet the great Palestinian woman and we 
pledge to her that in the coming years she will celebrate 
women's day in a free, independent, and democratic homeland for 
the people of free and revolutionary men. 
  Sisters and brothers, I renew my pledge and vow to you. I 
tell you that difficulties will only increase our strength, 
faith, and firmness. A hammer breaks glass but flattens iron. 
We have taken speedy steps and offered thousands of martyrs and 
will not cease our struggle in all forms until our people obtain 
their full rights. Let this triumphant march continue. The path 
to the independent state still requires sacrifices, struggle, 
and suffering. However, our indefatigable stamina and 
unconquerable determination will continue. God bless our 
people, the generous people of martyrs and sacrifices. In the 
name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. God's good 
pleasure was on the believers when they swore fealty to thee 
under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts and he sent 
down tranquility to them; and he rewarded them with a speedy 
victory. [Koranic verse] 
  Revolution until victory. 
  Your brother, Abu 'Ammar

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat by 'Awdah 'Awdah in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] ['Awdah] You were a close aide to President 'Arafat, 
but recently your role has been marginalized. Would you explain 
the reasons for this? 
  [Abu-Sharif] My relations with brother President 'Arafat are 
still cordial. These militant relations cannot be weakened. 
Within the framework of the ongoing peace process, the 
negotiating team attracts attention because it is charged with 
this task. Meanwhile, many leaders not directly involved in the 
negotiations are charged with other tasks. Regrettably, I have 
read many articles and reports that try to distort things and 
misinterpret them. As you have noticed, I did not respond to 
these attempts, because we face difficult tasks now. No doubt, 
the current stage is one of the most difficult stages of the 
struggle; it is a sensitive stage on the internal level as well, 
in terms of negotiations, foreign relations, and inter-Arab 
relations. It is natural to see different viewpoints regarding 
tactical points and the working plan and mechanism that must be 
followed in the interest of our people to achieve what can be 
achieved through the peace process, despite its difficulties. 
The objective is full Israeli withdrawal from Arab territory. 
This cannot be achieved by remote control. 
  Negotiations are being held with the Israeli enemy. He is a 
difficult enemy, not an easy enemy. When we talk with the 
Israeli enemy we must not forget we are talking with an enemy, 
regardless of its delegations' visits to Tunisia and the 
meetings in Cairo. We must not forget it is an enemy who tries 
to achieve as much as it can within the land for peace equation. 
  We believe the absence of coordination among the Arab 
parties 
involved in the talks will weaken the Arab position, or at 
least, strengthen the position of the Israeli negotiators. We 
see that the Israeli stand is united, despite the known 
differences between Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq Rabin. We also 
see that it is stronger, although we know Rabin's majority in 
the Knesset is very small and that the Likud is strong. When we 
talk about the working mechanism, there are points that must be 
tackled to strengthen the position of the Palestinian and Arab 
negotiators. I believe the existence of different views and 
detailed discussions are important so we can form a sound 
opinion in the service of our people. 
  I would like to note the importance of Jordanian-Palestinian 
coordination, in particular within the framework of coordination 
among the Arab negotiating delegations. This must be united and 
capable of mobilizing Arab support. Without the unity of the 
Palestinian stand and the unity of the Arab position -- which 
must be supported by all Arab sides -- the position of each 
negotiating team will be weaker. Syria can negotiate in the 
Syrian track, but it will be stronger when it is supported by a 
united Arab position. This will make the U.S. Administration 
think carefully before taking any stand to appease Israel. 
  I believe neither the initial agreement nor the periodic 
meetings of the Arab parties involved in the process are enough. 
There must be continuous meetings on general and special 
issues. The general issues relate to the Arab-Israeli talks. 
The specific issues deal with each track. This will save us 
from suspicion and from falling into Israeli traps. 
  ['Awdah] I take it from what you say that the state of 
your relatonship with 'Arafat is fine? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Yes, it is as you describe. 
  ['Awdah] But you are in Amman now, while Tunis swarms with 
top Israeli, Russian, and U.S. officials, including Dennis Ross. 
Aren't you being marginalized? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I haven't been to Amman for a long time. I am 
here visiting relatives and friends. I leave for Tunis tomorrow. 
I know that Israeli, U.S., and Russian delegations are in Tunis 
to promote the implementation of the latest UN Security Council 
resolution. 
  ['Awdah] Hasn't 'Arafat invited you to join these talks? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I am returning to my office in Tunis. 
  ['Awdah] Do you have anything against the Cairo 
negotiations? 
  [Abu-Sharif] People may have their own opinions about the 
peace process and the media handling of it. 
  ['Awdah] Can you be more specific? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Take the Hebron massacre, for example. The 
tragedy might have been seized upon to put Israel on the spot. 
The tragic massacre stigmatizes not only Israel but the entire 
West. We should have mounted a worldwide campaign that did not 
stop until Israel was forced into drawing up a timetable for the 
withdrawal of settlers from the occupied territories, 
simultaneously with the withdrawal of Israeli troops. The issue 
is not about disarming the settlers. The settlers and 
settlements are part of the establishment of occupation. This 
objective might have been obtained away from the battlefield or 
even the diplomatic front. Ninety-five precent of a campaign for 
such an objective must be fought through the media. The 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is a black chapter in the annals of 
the West. We ought to have used it to mobilize world opinion 
and put all the governments of the West in the dock. 
  Let me ask you this: Suppose a Palestinian extremist shot 10 
worshipers at the Wailing Wall? How would the Israelis have 
handled such an incident? Wouldn't they have turned the world 
upside down? 
  ['Awdah] And since, as you say, your relationship with 
'Arafat is fine and you are his media adviser, what stopped you 
from launching this media campaign? 
  [Abu-Sharif] No comment. 
  ['Awdah] Then you are not 'Arafat's media adviser any more? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I still hold that position. I have no regrets 
over my optimistic outlook about the peace process. 
  ['Awdah] At the 20th session of the Palestine National 
Council in Algiers, you told me you were optimistic about the 
chances of an independent Palestinian state. Now, three years 
on, nothing significant has been achieved. 
  [Abu-Sharif] I never had any illusions that the peace 
process would be not be long and arduous. Even now, I dare say 
that, in spite of everything, the peace process will move 
forward. The whole exercise is not up to the local players. 
There is the international community's will to put in place the 
land-for-peace formula, no matter how much time and effort, and 
even blood, that will take. Israel is in a difficult position. 
It is not as if it is being dragged to the peace process 
against its will. Peace advances its own interests. However, 
it is an illusion to think that the peace process will be an 
easy ride. After all, we are negotiating with an enemy. 
  Once again, let me stress that without proper and real 
intra-Arab coordination, between the Palestinians and Jordanians 
in particular, we will get nowhere. 
  ['Awdah] I would like to remind you that, in Algiers, you 
told me the peace process would lead to peace, an independent 
state, and Jerusalem. 
  [Abu-Sharif] I still say the same. The peace process has not 
moved very far, but it will snowball as soon as Israel begins to 
withdraw from Jericho and Gaza. When withdrawal begins, the 
snowball will create its own momentum, grow larger, create a 
totally new psychological climate, and make it impossible for 
settlers to stay in a predominantly Arab environment that was 
usurped by colonialist aggression. We have to start the 
process, Once the withdrawal begins, it will continue until the 
end. 
  ['Awdah] They say you have a personal view about unity 
between Jordan and Palestine. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Union between Jordan and Palestine exists. What 
separates them is the Israeli occupation. Logically and 
psychologically, you cannot divide a family, half of which is in 
Amman and the other half is in Jerusalem. 
  ['Awdah] Has 'Arafat assigned new duties to you? Have you 
anything to say about that? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Certain duties do not need statements. This is 
natural. 
  ['Awdah] You were the first to call for a 
Palestinian-Israeli 
meeting. Do you regret it? 
  [Abu-Sharif] This is true, and I do not regret the 
initiative. I was the first to propose the implementation of the 
international resolutions through direct negotiations with 
Israel and under the slogan of establishing an independent 
Palestinian state that will live in peace next to Israel. It is 
not land for peace, but land and a state for peace. I still 
demand the same, and I call for the implementation of Resolution 
242. By the way, this resolution applies to East Jerusalem, 
too. It is wrong to raise an argument about this issue and to 
deal with Jerusalem separately. Resolution 242 covers East 
Jerusalem automatically. Therefore, it is wrong to deal with 
the issue of Jerusalem as if it were a separate issue. Dealing 
with Jerusalem separately will enable other parties to say yes 
or no, while insisting on Resolution 242, which covers 
Jerusalem, means it is natural for Jerusalem to be included in 
Resolution 242. 
  ['Awdah] You prepared for the political process before the 
Madrid conference. You may have read unpublished documents in 
which the United States made promises to President 'Arafat and 
then ignored them. 
  [Abu-Sharif] Yes, Washington and the PLO exchanged 
documents, 
including the letter of invitation to the peace conference and 
the letter of assurances. These are documented. However, I can 
say a certain party may disavow such documents when the 
political situation changes. What is important is that the Arab 
front should remain unified to impose its respect on other 
parties. 
  ['Awdah] Are there documents other than the letter of 
invitation to the peace conference and the letter of assurances? 
  [Abu-Sharif] President Bush and President Clinton exchanged 
official letters and documents, which contain a U.S. pledge to 
implement the land-for-peace formula and Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338, to give the Palestinian people their 
full legitimate political rights, and to guarantee Israel's 
security. All these documents were worked out before and after 
the Madrid conference. 
  ['Awdah] Did the PLO and Washington exchange secret 
documents 
and letters? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Undoubtedly. There are secret things and 
documents that have not been published. 
  ['Awdah] Do you believe Washington's decision to abstain 
from voting on the paragraphs of the recent UN Security Council 
Resolution Number 904 pertaining to Jerusalem and the occupied 
territories reflects a U.S. retreat from pledges it has made to 
Palestinians? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I do not believe this reflects a U.S. retreat. 
In the same vein, I cannot see it as reconfirmation of previous 
U.S. stands on the issue. Washington's abstention from voting 
on the paragraph pertaining to Jerusalem has clouded the issue. 
Hence, the U.S. position must be clarified. The U.S. 
Administration cannot provide an explanation for its stand 
unless Arab negotiators make a joint official demand, asking the 
United States to explain its position. For my part, I support 
His Majesty King Husayn, who recently said he will demand an 
official explanation for Washington's decision to abstain from 
voting, because abstention is neither yes nor no. We do have 
official letters from the United States, explaining its position 
toward occupied East Jerusalem. 
  ['Awdah] You are reported to have had your own views toward 
the Cairo and Oslo accords. Given the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, what do you have to say? 
  [Abu-Sharif] I believe events have superseded these two 
agreements. For example, in the Oslo accord, the Israelis did 
not acknowledge the need for an international presence in the 
occupied territories. But, in the aftermath of the massacre, 
the Israeli Government endorsed an international presence. This 
step forward is not enshrined in the accord. The Israeli 
Government agreed to deem two Israeli organizations extremist 
and terrorist to pave the way for evicting them from the city of 
Hebron. This is another step forward. Additionally, the 
release of a large number of Palestinians is an accomplishment, 
because it was not scheduled. Undoubtedly, the talks currently 
under way in Tunis are addressing the ways and means of 
implementing UN Security Council Resolution 904. The talks are 
addressing the definition of international protection. The 
deployment of Palestinian policemen in the city of Hebron was 
not enshrined in the Oslo accord. 
  ['Awdah] You have deemed the Oslo accord an accomplishment, 
although you have not contributed to it. However, it is 
reported that your private comments on this accord are different 
from the public comments you make on it. How true is this? 
  [Abu-Sharif] There is no doubt that the Oslo accord is a 
significant accomplishment. I have articulated this position in 
private and public. This is because we will establish 
Palestinian national authority on any inch of territory Israeli 
troops vacate, as the Palestine National Council sessions of 
1977 and 1974 advocated. Israel has agreed to withdraw from the 
territories. Anyone who believes liberation is achievable by a 
knockout stroke is wrong. The liberation of our Palestinian 
territories is achievable only by degrees. The important thing 
is that we remain steadfast until the implementation of the 
international legitimacy resolutions, after which there will be 
comprehensive peace. Comprehensive peace will be the outcome of 
joint struggle by all Arab sides. 
  ['Awdah] I would like to raise the question I first posed to 
you regarding the reports that Yasir 'Arafat has marginalized 
your role after he reached the conclusion that the Palestinian 
information institution has failed to pave the way for an 
agreement with Israel. Likewise, the Palestinian negotiators 
have failed to reach an agreement with Israel. Meanwhile, 
Palestinian secret channels have been successful in this regard. 
What is your comment on all this? 
  [Abu-Sharif] Failure and success cannot be judged by a 
single 
specific issue. We should use the terms success and failure 
when we address the overall outlook regarding the 
accomplishments of the Palestinian information institutions, the 
magnitude and effectiveness of which vary. Hence, I cannot 
speak of the success or failure of the information institution, 
because there are actually various information institutions. 
But, the Palestinian information institutions can undoubtedly 
do more and do better to address events and developments.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hani al-Hasan, Fatah Central Committee </F>
member, by Mufid 'Awwad; place and date not given] 
  [Text] ['Awwad] To begin with, let us try to put the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in the context of the ongoing 
Arab-Israeli contacts. 
  [Al-Hasan] In order for us to make sense of why it took 
three 
long weeks to pass the UN Security Council resolution on the 
massacre, we need first to ask why the massacre happened. It is 
believed by some that the massacre was committed by a murderous, 
psychopathic settler. The massacre was really the product of a 
debate inside the Israeli security services on how to handle 
Palestinian policemen in the impending self-rule authority. The 
recruits for the future Palestinian police force can be expected 
to be patriotic young men victimized by occupation. The Israeli 
security establishment goes on to argue that, driven by an urge 
to exact vengeance, many of these Palestinians may take it out 
on settlers. The Israeli security establishment also fears a 
mounting militant spirit among the Palestinians, buoyed by 
confidence that they are achieving success. 
  There were two trends of thought within the Israeli military 
security community. The first was that If the Palestinians 
should break the Gaza-Jericho accord by attacks on settlers, 
they would reply with the proper means. The second trend, 
which, incidentally, has prevailed, argued that right from the 
beginning the security forces should create a climate of fear, 
warning the Palestinians of the dire consequences of any attacks 
they might mount on the settlers after April, 1994, especially 
since it was Fatah, in particular, that carried out most of the 
armed attacks inside the occupied territories, notably in the 
West Bank, since the signing of the Oslo agreement. 
  Hence Israel's resort to direct and open terror, as seen in 
the bloody and savage Hebron massacre, to instill panic and fear 
among the Palestinian population. 
  ['Awwad] So you think the massacre was perpetrated in 
implementation of a decision made at the highest Israeli 
security levels? 
  [Al-Hasan] Absolutely. But what Israel did not bargain for 
was the scale of the Palestinian popular pressure inside 
Palestine and in brotherly Jordan. Israel was further surprised 
by the angry and strong Islamic, Arab, and even international 
reaction. Acting in character, the Israelis then set about an 
operation of damage control. 
  The talks in Washington were held within the framework of a 
feverish Israeli effort and must be seen in this light. Rabin's 
visit to Washington was made to shore up his popularity. Tel 
Aviv, Tunis, and Washington all wanted to make the most of the 
massacre. It must be said that the Tunis leadership failed to 
use Israel's crime at the Ibrahimi Mosque to expose its true 
ambitions in the occupied land and push for the world to assume 
its humanitarian and moral responsibilities toward the 
Palestinian people. Now what do I mean by the Tunis leadership 
using the massacre? 
  Let's not bury our heads in the sand. The Palestinian people 
are suffering from divisions while Israel is scoring major 
successes on the economic and international fronts. Any 
right-thinking person will tell you that the concessions made in 
Oslo and Cairo need not have been made -- not under any 
circumstances. Even President Mubarak's adviser Usamah al-Baz 
said that there was a need to restore balance to the Oslo 
agreement. Even the Europeans are now talking about the need to 
send international forces to protect the Palestinians, and this 
is quite important. Simply speaking, the world is interpreting 
UN Security Council Resolution 242 so as to mean Israel is 
sitting in occupied rather than disputed territory. 
  The Palestinian leadership has no choice but to make what I 
would call a bold decision dictated by the national Palestinian 
conscience; namely admit that its political line is flawed. The 
split in Palestinian ranks and inter-Palestinian squabbling and 
Israel's gains are all the result of a mishandling of the 
negotiations. 
  ['Awwad] Since Madrid? 
  [Al-Hasan] Yes, since Madrid. 
  ['Awwad] What do you mean by the political line? You were 
one of the Palestinian leaders that laid down the foundations of 
a political settlement for the Palestinian issue? 
  [Al-Hasan] The Palestinians are being forced by Israel to 
negotiate with them unilaterally. This is the consequence of an 
Israeli argument that the Palestinians must enter into 
unilateral talks with Israel. Then there is the argument 
advanced by Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]; namely, that if you are 
unable to get all that you want, you may settle for some of it. 
The result has been that Israel began talking about 
indispensable security settlements and dispensable political 
settlements. Israel thus capitalized on this argument by 
insisting that part of the occupied territories will not be 
vacated. 
  ['Awwad] An example? 
  [Al-Hasan] For example, agreeing in Oslo to delay the 
Jerusalem issue to the second phase of negotiations was 
dangerous. Israel says the Oslo agreement postpones the 
Jerusalem issue. I wonder what Jerusalem they are talking 
about. Israel is not talking about East Jerusalem, the small 
area it occupied along with Arab and Palestinian areas in 1967, 
or about West Jerusalem. It is talking about today's Jerusalem, 
according to the occupation authorities' concept of two cities 
with boundaries that have been extended close to Bethlehem in 
the south, Ramallah in the north, and Jericho in the east. When 
we begin to discuss the subject of assuming power in the West 
Bank after a few weeks, greater Jerusalem, with an area that is 
more than 10 percent of the West Bank, will be excluded from the 
areas that will come under Palestinian authority because 
Israel's interpretation of Jerusalem is different from that of 
the PLO. This should not be accepted at all. Accordingly, 
agreeing to the current phased negotiations, that is, a 
transitional and then a final stage, means agreeing to splitting 
territory. Anyone who partitions land will also partition 
rights. Therefore, under no circumstances should we accept 
phased negotiations, although we might accept phased 
implementation. 
  In the letter of invitation to the Madrid [conference], the 
PLO accepted phased negotiations. This political line, which 
now prevails, is responsible for splitting the cause. We are 
now seeking security for Gaza and Jericho, but we are supposed 
to be seeking security for all Palestinians. The Palestine 
question is in a real impasse due to the phased negotiations. 
The PLO leadership should have benefited from the obvious 
international solidarity with the Palestinians -- people and 
organization -- after the Zionist massacre. This great national 
Palestinian support should have been employed to prove the 
indisputable fact that there can be no coexistence between 
settlers and Palestinians; it should have been used to 
immediately call for negotiations on the final solution as a new 
policy that will dictate new alliances and new coordination. 
  ['Awwad] Why does Israel insist on phased negotiations? 
  [Al-Hasan] Israel believes the PLO should not call for the 
implementation of Resolution 242 at the first stage of 
negotiations because, it says, the PLO is not a party to that 
resolution. 
  ['Awwad] How can the Palestinians break out of this impasse? 
  [Al-Hasan] The solution lies simply in coordinating with 
Jordan, which is a party to 242, and with Syria and Lebanon, for 
the sake of negotiating with one voice and one tactic and 
advancing or retreating together. The idea of one Arab 
delegation to negotiate all issues and deal with withdrawal as 
one issue, security as one issue, water as one issue, and mutual 
relations as one issue, can be proposed once again. 
  ['Awwad] But Israel, whose policy is based on the tactic of 
dealing with Arab parties separately, will certainly reject the 
idea of a unified Arab delegation. 
  [Al-Hasan] We can then run affairs according to one policy 
and one plan on all "tables." For example, Syria and Jordan 
emphasize that no economic normalization talks will be held with 
Israel unless there is progress in political negotiations and 
unless Israel promises to withdraw from every inch of the Arab 
territories occupied in 1967, whether they are Syrian, Lebanese, 
or Jordanian territories. 
  ['Awwad] Why doesn't this apply to Palestinians? They used 
to say the Palestinian position is weak. 
  [Al-Hasan] The helpless ones in the PLO said this. However, 
in the aftermath of the recent massacre, nobody can say the 
Palestinian situation or Palestinian awareness is weak. 
Therefore, receiving any Israeli delegation in Tunis before 
voting on the Security Council resolution was a big mistake. 
The wording of the Security Council resolution itself was very 
weak and wsa not in keeping with the horrible massacre. 
  ['Awwad] As a prominent leader of the Fatah Movement and as 
a member of the Fatah Central Committee, do your political ideas 
on the peace process and your position on the Oslo accord 
reflect the views of the Fatah Central Committee or the views of 
a large number of the Fatah Central Committee members? 
  [Al-Hasan] I speak as a Fatah Central Committee member. I 
cannot claim to be speaking on behalf of the Fatah Central 
Committee. Still, recently, more Fatah Central Committee 
members believe there must be a reconsideration of all that has 
happened, and all that is happening. The recent statements 
published in AL-DUSTUR reflected this trend. Brothers Muhammad 
Jihad and 'Abbas Zaki [Fatah Central Committee members], as well 
as many others, see a need to seriously reconsider all that is 
happening. As for me, I believe we must mobilize Palestinian 
popular forces with clear political positions so they can 
pressure the leadership and encourage it to take drastic 
measures to change the course of the negotiations. 
  ['Awwad] When you mention the word leadership, what 
specifically do you mean? Do you mean the PLO Executive 
Committee, or the leading PLO institutions? When you mention 
the word leadership, what do you mean? If you mean the PLO 
Executive Committee, four members of this committee have 
resigned, not to mention those who tendered their resignations 
earlier, that is, in the immediate aftermath of the Oslo accord. 
It is true that the PLO has been experiencing a legislative 
impasse since the resignation of Palestine National Council 
Speaker Shaykh 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Sa'ih. But, can we say the PLO 
leadership is experiencing an executive impasse? If the answer 
is yes, what will happen, since the current phase requires 
concerted efforts by all in the context of a harmonious 
Palestinian leadership that is directly responsible for the 
destiny of its own people? 
  [Al-Hasan] This question is extremely important and serious. 
It has been on my mind since you started this interview. 
  What closes ranks and unifies efforts is a clear political 
line. By the same token, what divides is a mistaken political 
line. With regard to the Palestinians, they can simply judge 
the proposed solution as to whether it is sound or not, in light 
of the national consensus it enjoys. This is because 
nationalist political forces cannot disagree on national issues. 
  Hence, we see the organizational impasse facing the PLO, the 
legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. One-third 
of the PLO leadership, in terms of the political quorum 
reflecting the various political forces making up the PLO, has 
resigned. Only the Palestinian People's Party has continued to 
promote the PLO's current policy line. With regard to the 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and the Palestine Liberation 
Front, their votes reflect opposition to, not support for, the 
current policy line. This means the PLO Executive Committee is 
currently denied a political and a numerical quorum, 
particularly since three of its members have resigned. In case 
new resignations take place, the PLO will face a real impasse. 
  ['Awwad] This concerns the PLO in general. What about the 
Fatah Movement? 
  [Al-Hasan] With regard to the situation on the ground, there 
is a persistent, continuous, and serious Fatah demand that the 
course of negotiations be rectified, and the facts made 
available to the Palestinian people's masses. This is because 
the statements by some officials on the Gaza-Jericho accord were 
incorrect and untrue. They have not enlightened the Palestinian 
people about the facts. 
  ['Awwad] Could you elaborate on this, please? 
  [Al-Hasan] While commenting on the Gaza-Jericho accord, and 
the Oslo accord, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has said displaced people 
will return home immediately. Undoubtedly, 700,000 displaced 
people were overjoyed when they heard this. Nobody can blame 
them, because they then thought they would be returning home the 
next day. 
  Now, it seems no more than 10,000 displaced people will be 
allowed to return over the next three years. It has been 
reported that the number may be increased to 20,000 or 30,000. 
All displaced persons must return together. This is common 
sense, and this is our conception of a proper solution. 
  By not allowing the repatriation of displaced people, Israel 
wants to fragment rights and territories. When the issue of 
releasing Palestinian prisoners was discussed in Taba, the 
Israeli delegation rejected a PLO proposal to form a committee 
to discuss the issue, contending the provisions enshrined in the 
Oslo accord underscore security for Israel. Once Israel's 
security is ensured, then pertinent measures can be taken by 
Israel, Israeli negotiators argued. That is why the negotiators 
formed the security and confidence-building measures committee. 
Accordingly, the release of prisoners must promote Israeli 
security. 
  As a matter of course, any level-headed person well-versed 
in 
conflict management would not have accepted any such ideas, the 
centerpiece of which is meant to promote Israeli security. This 
is because agreements should be balanced. Mutual interests must 
be promoted. Otherwise, there would have been no reason for 
engaging in negotiations in the first place. 
  Given all this, the Palestinian people and the Fatah 
Movement 
are witnessing calls for reconsidering the course of the 
negotiations. However, international pressures on the PLO, the 
agency that makes decisions regarding the Palestine question, 
are immense. This, of course, does not exempt the Fatah 
Movement of its responsibilities, because it is the mainstay of 
the PLO. Hence, we would like to say that silence is no longer 
golden. We must make an effort to spare the Fatah Movement any 
further external international pressure. 
  ['Awwad] In your opinion, there is some erosion in the 
PLO's stand on how to run the conflict. In this regard, there 
were two memorandums on how to launch reform, but the 
signatories to both memorandums were constrained in one way or 
another. So experience proves reform endeavors have not 
produced any remarkably positive results. The Palestinian 
street does not view many reformists as serious because until 
recently they supported and advocated the PLO's political line 
and political leadership. What suddenly made the reformists 
take their positions? How can a radical change be introduced 
into the current political line? 
  [Al-Hasan] Anyone who studies the history of any political 
movement, including the PLO, will see that any history has its 
ups and downs. But, this is far from a collapse, which will 
indicate, if it takes place, a defect in the issue. Ups and 
downs, however, do not necessarily mean a defect, but may be the 
result of an upset in the balance of power. 
  The difference between collapse, on one hand, and ups and 
downs, on the other, is that the people, in the second case, are 
always supportive. But collapse usually results in the 
disengagement of you and your popular base. This is 
scientifically true, not a matter of interpretation. When you 
propose a political line representing the aspirations of the 
masses, these masses will rally around you. Only then will you 
have a broad base. The members of the organization will grow in 
number and quality and there will be enough money. 
  When you propose an incorrect political line that does not 
represent mass aspirations, the masses will abandon you, your 
organization will decompose, your revenues will decrease, your 
well-being and credibility will retreat before your people and 
the world, and you will collapse. 
  The crisis is one of the political line. The refugee issue, 
as an expression, is no longer mentioned in the refugee 
committee. What is being discussed is the return of part of the 
displaced people, not the repatriation of refugees. The refugee 
issue was postponed until a final solution is found, while 
preparations are under way for self-rule to assume the 
responsibilities of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
on the eastern and western banks. This is why the current 
Palestinian political line does not represent the refugees' 
ambitions. Therefore, Palestinian circles in Syria, Lebanon, 
and the camps reacted negatively and violently against the 
agreement and even attacked the PLO leadership because the 
current political line does not represent them, and might 
sacrifice their interests. 
  Therefore, I believe any talk about reform or democracy will 
produce no results unless a new political line is worked out 
that meets the aspirations of political and popular forces. 
Only then will circumstances for democratic action be available. 
  ['Awwad] How can a new political line be worked out? What is 
the best mechanism for that? 
  [Al-Hasan] As I said, the current political line has 
produced 
negative results. This cannot be denied except by arrogant 
people who claim Palestinians are making achievements and 
scoring victories on the road to the liberation of the land. 
  Even after they enter Gaza and Jericho, there will be no 
guarantees that everything will take place quietly. The 
Israelis will not suddenly become peaceful. As I said, the 
recent brutal massacre is a studied security decision, which is 
being exploited by Israel to overwhelm Palestinian morale in 
preparation for the next stage of negotiations. 
  Hence, strong political pressure should be placed on that 
leadership to prevent it from relinquishing any inch of land in 
the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem, and relinquishing the 
refugees' rights by creating a new political line to run the 
conflict. 
  ['Awwad] Since the establishment of the PLO and until the 
Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the Palestinian masses have rallied 
around the PLO and its leadership, despite differences of views 
on the leadership's policy in running the conflict. 
  It is noteworthy that as a result of the massacre, the 
masses 
called for toppling the PLO leadership for the first time in 30 
years. Are the demonstrations that the Palestinian people 
staged after the massacre a spontaneous expression of the 
Palestinian masses' reluctance to support the PLO leadership and 
the beginning of popular abandonment of it? 
  [Al-Hasan] The demonstrations in Jordan and inside and 
outside the occupied territories are undoubtedly an alarm to the 
leadership that its political line has become so weak that the 
masses will raise their voices and reject that line. 
  We should not fall into the faults of the pan-Arab movement 
in the seventies, when they said that Arab unity did not take 
place because of the absence of popular awareness. Holding the 
masses responsible is shortsighted, and evidence of the 
leadership's weakness. The people always have the right 
strategic sense and they express their true interests. 
  Our people believe the displaced will not return, that 
massacres against them will escalate, and that the Hebron 
massacre is the fiercest of all massacres, but will not 
necessarily be the last. 
  They also believe that Israel will determine Palestinian 
entry into Jericho. This means sharing sovereignty, which is a 
step toward sharing the land. 
  In other words, a part of the negotiations is based on the 
legitimacy of the occupation, and the wrong political line will, 
undoubtedly, serve the occupation and your enemy in the final 
analysis. 
  ['Awwad] Abu-Tariq [Hani al-Hasan], this leads us to an 
open and angry question reiterated by the Palestinians: Are 
there no skilled Palestinians other than Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Jamil 
al-Tarifi, Nasr Yusuf, and the rest of the Palestinian 
delegation -- with all due respect to those people -- to 
confront Amnon Shahaq, Uri Savir, and others? How do you 
explain this? 
  [Al-Hasan] Once again, I believe the problem lies in the 
political line, because it produces people who refuse to take 
part in any delegation because they are not convincing in this 
line or it produces people who agree to follow orders. When the 
political line is weak and a failure, many forces and skills 
withdraw because nobody can rectify the wrong political line. 
  ['Awwad] So, the choices are being made on the basis of 
loyalty to the existing political line, not on the basis of who 
is capable of handling the conflict? 
  [Al-Hasan] Yes. I was asked to supervise the multilateral 
talks. However, I set a condition of not holding the 
multilateral sessions between us and the Israelis in any Arab 
country. This means the rejection of normalization with Israel 
before realizing a political solution, that is, full Israeli 
withdrawal. I could have accepted the offer if the leadership 
had responded to this condition. 
  ['Awwad] You mean no normalization before withdrawal? 
  [Al-Hasan] Yes. This is in line with the other Arab 
parties' stands on this issue. I believe the PLO should abandon 
the multilateral talks, or at least not hold them in Arab 
countries such as Tunis, where the PLO headquarters is located. 
Indeed, holding the multilaterals in any Arab venue will be a 
big step toward normalization, but in return for what? Nothing. 
  Israel so far has been recognized by India, China, and half 
the population of the world. It received billions of dollars in 
economic aid. It opened closed international markets to its 
exports. Israel's economy in 1990 suffered from a reduction in 
growth; the growth was minus 2. Today, however, and as a result 
of the huge aid it is receiving, Israel's economic growth is 
beginning and has reached plus one, and is on its way to become 
plus four. 
  Israel received all this through the political settlement 
process, Meanwhile, none of the Arab parties gained an inch of 
their occupied territories and not a single Palestinian employee 
received a milligram of security. 
  Why continue providing the Israelis with all the factors of 
benefiting from the peace process? 
  ['Awwad] You said discussing the issue of Jerusalem at a 
later stage of negotiations shows the well-known Israeli 
intentions toward the city. How do you view the Jerusalem 
situation, since it is a sensitive situation that has been 
complicated in recent times? 
  [Al-Hasan] Jerusalem is Palestinian territory to which 
Resolution 242 applies. The basic principle is that 
Palestinians should have sovereignty over this territory. 
Afterwards, all issues on the religious level can be discussed. 
As for now, we can only discuss the issues of Israeli 
withdrawal and returning the Palestinian territories occupied 
since 1967 to the sovereignty of the Palestinians, including 
Jerusalem. 
  We believe developments in the Jerusalem issue are a result 
of the wrong political line. The Vatican, for example, is 
beginning to talk about its responsibilities toward the 
Christian places. This is a big danger. However, when you 
adopt such incorrect behavior, the Vatican becomes free of its 
commitments toward what you, yourself, have been demanding and 
then abandoned or postponed to an unknown stage. 
  When there was Palestinian and Arab Islamic insistence on a 
united stand toward Jerusalem, the Vatican, throughout the past 
50 years, was committed to this stand. However, when it found 
that some Palestinians are willing to discuss the issue of 
Jerusalem from a perspective that is totally different than what 
is known, the door opened wide. 
  The Vatican's interference is a very serious thing. However, 
we must admit that it is not the Vatican's fault. Indeed, the 
wrong political line is what opened the door. Moreover, 
President Clinton started saying that Jerusalem is the capital 
of Israel. Vice President Al Gore also began to reiterate that 
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It should be noted that Al 
Gore made new statements that were unprecedented by U.S. 
officials, in Clinton's era or in the era of those who preceded 
him. 
  The basic issue that must be implemented and championed 
deals 
with the need to implement the political line. No one thinks 
entering Jericho is a good start. On the contrary, the Israelis 
have a well-studied plan for the stage following the 
Gaza-Jericho stage. This plan began with the Hebron massacre. 
In the next stage, Israel will seek to create many problems, 
massacres, and obstacles. I strongly believe there still exists 
a secret Israeli decision not to withdraw from the West Bank and 
to play around with political formulas to guarantee their stay 
in the West Bank. This is because their real policy aims at 
signing a military agreement with some authority, that will 
exist four or five years from now, in order to keep their Army 
as an allied Army and not as an occupying Army. 
  However, this does not mean their plan will succeed because 
I 
have faith in the Palestinian people. I believe our people on 
both sides of the Jordan River can confront Israeli schemes. 
The biggest example of this is that the massacre did not weaken 
our people. Indeed, our 1948 Palestinians performed their full 
job in condemning the barbaric crime. 
  However, this does not mean that our people's sacrifices 
should continues until time eternal. This is especially so 
since a successful political leadership is responsible for 
accomplishing its goals with minimum material and human losses. 
However, what is happening is that we are paying dearly as a 
result of our political line in terms of martyrs, money, and 
time, while the accomplishments, as we see, are not in keeping 
with this long struggle. 
  ['Awwad] As a Palestinian official and a leading Fatah 
member, you and your comrades have well-known stands in 
defending independent Palestinian decision making. Based on 
this, how do you assess the Palestinian leadership's relations 
with the partners in the common Arab destiny? 
  [Al-Hasan] Anyone who examines the current situation will 
simply realize there are Palestinian relations with Arab states, 
but there are no common policies between the PLO and the major 
Arab forces in the region. Of course, this is a serious 
disorder, considering that any political line derives its 
strength from the people's support and from its alliances with 
its partners and friends. If one of these two elements is 
missing, the political line will collapse. The current 
Palestinian political line is collapsing because it lacks 
popular support and common policies with the Arab states that 
are parties to the conflict. Therefore, in the first place, 
there must be joint Palestinian-Jordanian policies, then common 
Palestinian-Syrian-Lebanese policies, and common policies with 
the broader Arab arena, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 
Morocco, Libya, and Egypt. This is because common policies can 
create a political balance between the Arabs and Israel. 
  ['Awwad] But, how can you explain the current distinguished 
relations between the Palestinian leadership and the Egyptian 
leadership? 
  [Al-Hasan] Egypt supports a phased settlement. But the 
brothers in Egypt have already restored their land, so they are 
no longer harmed by a phased settlement. I am sure that if 
Sinai was occupied, no Egyptian official would accept a phased 
settlement on behalf of the Palestinians. The proof is that 
President al-Sadat did not accept a phased settlement of Sinai. 
In a well-known press statement he said: No to phased 
negotiations, yes to phased implementation, and no to the 
relinquishment of any inch of Egyptian territory. Our difference 
with al-Sadat was because he said Sinai before Jerusalem--in 
other words, because he separated Jerusalem and Sinai. On the 
contrary, President Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir said Jerusalem before 
Sinai and the Golan before Sinai. If there had been a common 
political line among the Arab peoples, we would have an 
important weapon in our hand, namely, summoning the Egyptian 
ambassador from Tel Aviv, and expelling the Israeli ambassador 
from Cairo. This would jeopardize the entire situation--the 
current situation in which Israel is making one gain after 
another as a result of Israel's dealing with each Arab side 
separately. 
  ['Awwad] The Palestinian leadership is under pressure to go 
back to the negotiating table. There are attempts to beautify 
this return to the negotiating table through temptations that do 
not include the acceptance of the PLO's conditions to resume the 
talks. The question is how Hani al-Hasan sees the future stage 
in light of this Arab situation and the imbalance in favor of 
Israel? 
  [Al-Hasan] I have written a lengthy study on the seriousness 
of accepting the Madrid paper. I still believe the situation in 
the Arab region has not been settled yet. This is because this 
entire region will witness many political earthquakes, 
especially after the international balance collapsed with the 
fall of the Soviet Union. A new balance is being built. Our 
region is the center of this new balance, because it is the 
center of energy and agricultural fields, which will produce 
unique agricultural stuffs in the future, taking into 
consideration the growing population of the world. A big 
conflict is raging in and around our region. This conflict is 
still hidden. The parties to this conflict are Europe, the 
United States, Russia, and Japan. The United States needs this 
region to be calm because it wants to control oil without any 
rivals in order to twist the arms of Germany and Japan and to 
obtain economic concessions from them. This is because the 
United States, which controlled more than 75 percent of the 
world's economy in 1948, now controls only 27 percent. The 
United States now spends a billion dollars every day--and I know 
what I am talking about--to pay its debts and interest. If the 
United States does not mend its trade balance, it will seek the 
help of the World Bank in the year 2007. So, the United States 
is trying to avoid this by controlling this region of the world. 
  There is a conflict in the world on the balance required in 
the Arab region. Following the change in the situation in Iran, 
an agreement was reached to set up a Turkish-Iranian-Pakistani 
economic and political axis as a basic part of the regional 
balance of power. There is a decision to turn Israel into an 
economic and military force in order to maintain part of the 
balance in the region or to guarantee this balance. 
  Former President Bush considered Egypt part of this balance, 
but President Clinton does not believe so. Therefore, these 
forces want to send us back to the Cold War days and not 
recognize a regional Arab force in this part of the world. 
  During the Geneva meeting between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad 
and Clinton, al-Asad accomplished a great deal when he got the 
U.S. to decide that Syria will be part of the forthcoming 
regional structure. 
  Therefore, we, the sons of the East and West Banks -- 
Jordanians and Palestinians -- must discuss the issue from this 
angle. Where do we stand in the forthcoming regional structure? 
The issue is not that of 2 km in Jericho and 2 km in Gaza. It 
is where we stand in the forthcoming regional structure. If 
Israel becomes a regional force and the Arabs do not become a 
regional force, we will return to 1948 and to Israel's military 
and economic belligerence. 
  Israel -- which spends 33 percent of its annual budget to 
repay its debts and its interest, 16 percent for security, and 
19 percent for the army -- is in dire need of security to 
maintain its role in the forthcoming balance. In other words, 
there will be no role for Jordan, Palestine, Syria, or Egypt. 
There will be no role for the Arabs. 
  In accordance with the Oslo accord, the Palestinian-Israeli 
talks will resume two years after the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho accord. During these two years, an international 
agreement on the situation in the Arab region will be reached. 
Meanwhile, Israel is planning to keep the Palestinians and 
Jordanians outside the equation. 
  Therefore, I believe the real battle is coming. I believe 
the problem of the Oslo accord is that it weakened the 
Palestinian position in terms of its regional role. The Oslo 
accord seeks swift economic prosperity to promote the economy of 
greater Israel. What is required now is to reach a 
Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese concept to face the 
forthcoming stage. The PLO leadership will face darker 
political days if it does not immediately change its strategy, 
policy, and alliances. 
  We cannot gamble on Israel's good intentions. Zionism has 
continued to exist because more than one-half of the Israelis 
announce this clearly, and still consider Hebron and the West 
Bank the land of their ancestors. In his Washington address to 
the AIPAC [American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee], Rabin 
called this land Judaea and Samaria. 
  Therefore, I call on all national Palestinian forces and the 
political forces in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to develop a 
concept about our forthcoming regional role on the political, 
military, and economic levels to confront the coming plot aimed 
at weakening the Arabs and Muslims. 
  The first task of Palestinian politics is to topple the 
economic section of the Oslo accord. This must be the headline 
of the coming stage because Israel wants to merge the $3-billion 
Palestinian economy with the $67-billion Israeli economy as a 
step toward absorbing the land and economy together. 
  We must know that Jordan is forcibly linked with whatever 
takes place in the West Bank and that the Palestinians are 
forcibly linked with what takes place on the East Bank. 
Therefore, we must resist any call on the East Bank for Jordan 
to ignore what takes place in the West Bank as well as any call 
for merger with the Israeli economy and ignoring what takes 
place in the East Bank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive Committee </F>
member and secretary general of the Palestinian Popular Struggle 
Front, in Tunis, by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo, date not given; 
from the "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Undoubtedly the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations must rest on basic and firm principles. Could you 
tell us about the foundations of the Palestinian position on the 
negotiations during the coming stage? 
  [Ghawshah] As of this moment, no decision has been made by 
the PLO Executive Committee or by the Palestinian leadership to 
resume the negotiations. After the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque, a decision was made to suspend the negotiations until 
the Security Council adopted a resolution. The Security Council 
has now passed Resolution 904, which includes a series of 
measures for Israel to carry out--such as disarming the settlers 
and providing for an international presence--and some other 
steps that concern the United States and Russia, the cosponsors 
of the Madrid Conference, to ensure the implementation of these 
measures. As of this moment, nothing has been implemented. 
During the recent talks held in Tunis with the Israelis, the 
U.S. envoy and his delegation, the Russian envoy, and Norwegian 
envoy Mr. Larsen, the discussion focused on the need to set up a 
mechanism for implementing Security Council Resolution 904. 
  [Al-Jundi] So it is clear that the Palestinian side is eager 
to secure international protection for the Palestinians inside 
the occupied territories so that such massacre will not recur? 
  [Ghawshah] Yes. Thus, the PLO leadership has underlined a 
number of issues, including the question of international 
protection and the need for the presence of international 
observers as stipulated under the Security Council resolution, 
and the disarming of settlers and confiscation of their weapons, 
which is also specified under the Security Council resolution. 
The PLO leadership has reiterated a number of demands: namely, 
international protection, the entry of a Palestinian police 
force into Hebron, the formation of tripartite patrols made up 
of international observers, Palestinian police, and Israeli 
police to ensure security in Hebron, and the need to ensure that 
the settlers leave the city. 
  [Al-Jundi] But how can the Palestinians benefit from the 
Israeli offer to expedite the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]? 
  [Ghawshah] Before we talk about implementing the DOP we must 
first talk about a delicate and more urgent issue than the DOP, 
and that is the question of the settlers. How can the DOP be 
implemented when Israel continues to procrastinate over pulling 
the settlers out of Hebron? The urgent and basic question on 
which the Palestinian people want to see practical and tangible 
measures is the Security Council resolution, the withdrawal of 
the settlers from Hebron, and the banning of the settlers from 
carrying their weapons around among the defenseless 
Palestinians, who are being murdered and annihilated by the 
settlers and the Israeli Army. The Palestinian leadership will 
study the situation and make appropriate decisions in light of 
Israel's answers and practical measures, either deciding to 
resume the talks or to continue their suspension because of 
Israeli procrastination and failure to implement tangible and 
practical measures after the Hebron massacre. 
  [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that a high-level 
Palestinian-Israeli meeting could contribute to straightening 
things out and narrowing the differences between the two sides? 
  [Ghawshah] I do not think so. Several meetings have 
previously been held, both with Prime Minister Rabin, Peres, and 
other envoys. The main issue is the need for the Israeli 
Government to make a serious decision--that is, what are the 
measures that will be taken to end the murders by the settlers 
and pull them out from the Palestinian cities? Failing that, 
the cosponsors of the conference will have to take measures. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Samir Ghawshah, PLO Executive 
Committee member and secretary general of the Palestinian 
Popular Struggle Front, who is on the line with us from Tunis. 
Thank you and welcome to Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Ghawshah] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO representative in Cairo Sa'id </F>
Kamal by Sa'id Mu'addi on 23 March; from the "With the Midday 
Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] PLO representative in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, 
have you received any information or instructions about 
canceling today's scheduled negotiations between the two sides 
in Cairo? 
  [Kamal] I have received no instructions from the Palestinian 
leadership about stopping negotiations today. I have received 
no such information from Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
negotiating delegation. As I understood from some sources, the 
point is that [PLO Executive Committee member] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh 
said that last night's incidents in Hebron and their results 
will influence the course of negotiations. I agree with what 
Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh says. The subject is not marginal. Anger 
still rages and trouble is increasing. Our people are suffering 
daily blows from everywhere. So, this will certainly have an 
influence. But, negotiations are one thing and what happens in 
Hebron is something else. 
  [Mu'addi] What is the present situation after the Tunis 
talks 
between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian leadership? 
What subjects are on the agenda of today's meeting in Cairo? 
  [Kamal] Based on my reports through last night, I think the 
Israeli side has positive tendencies that will be demonstrated 
today during the negotiations between Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Mr. 
Amnon Shahaq on interpreting the question of protecting the 
Palestinians in the occupied territories, starting with the dear 
city of Hebron, its honorable people, and its heroic 
steadfastness. Therefore, this question will be the test for 
the arrangements that will be agreed on by the Cairo 
negotiations. 
  [Mu'addi] PLO representative in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, thank you 
very much. 
  [Kamal] Thank you.

  [Excerpt] Bethlehem, QUDS PRESS -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zir, the mayor of Hebron, has stressed his rejection of the 
Israeli proposal to set up a Palestinian police force in the 
city that would be subordinate to the municipality. 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, al-Zir said: Our job is not to 
approve such things. He noted that "the municipality has 
specific tasks which do not include supervising a police force." 
Al-Zir said, however, that "the setting up of a police force in 
Hebron should be carried out in coordination with the PLO and 
Arab states that have ties with the city, such as Jordan and 
Egypt." He stressed that "the Palestinians are demanding the 
establishment of a strong, armed, and independent police force 
in Hebron." 
  Al-Zir added: We do not accept this force being subordinate 
to any Israeli authority no matter what shape this link might 
have. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by Interior Minister Selim Saadi in Blida on 23 </F>
March -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Peace upon you all. On the occasion of my visit to 
this region, I would like to talk about a number of issues, 
especially regarding the situation in the country in general, 
and the security angle in particular. 
  My initial intervention will deal with three fundamental 
points, which should be addressed in order to comprehend the 
current situation in the country. These points are: 
  How did the general situation in the country evolve since 
the 
halt of the electoral process? 
  Second, how did this situation develop during the term of 
the 
HSC [Higher State Council]? 
  Third, what are the measures that the current power in 
office 
intends to take to achieve security, order, and to create the 
necessary conditions to establish a genuine democracy? 
  Regarding the first point, I believe that it will be 
essential to remind you, albeit briefly, of the situation that 
had prevailed in the country before the halt of the democratic 
process. Algeria went through a decade during which the affairs 
of the state were mismanaged and the resources of the country 
were squandered, a matter that resulted in a multifold crisis 
that reached its peak during the 1988 October demonstrations. 
  The message that young people, who were demonstrating, tried 
to put across was absolutely clear. These young people 
expressed the desire for a change in the political leadership, 
which led the country to bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this 
message was not grasped. For the sake of clinging to power, that 
regime decided to establish a suspicious democracy. Also, it 
laid down the 1989 Constitution that defined the rules of the 
democratic game and it frankly prohibited the creation of a 
party based on religious, linguistic, or regional basis. Such 
measures were implemented against a party that was founded on 
one of these criteria. 
  In other words, values shared by all the Algerian people 
were 
monopolized for political purposes. When the regime got 
entangled into its contradictions, it started gradually making 
concessions to the forces of darkness [reactionary forces] that 
had quickly laid their hands on public means [as heard] that 
existed in the municipal and provincial people's councils, the 
mosques, etc. They were getting ready to seize all the power 
despite the fact that they only represented a tiny minority in 
Algerian society. 
  This movement, Islamic Salvation Front, [FIS] never 
concealed 
its intention to eliminate the democratic system for good the 
day it seized power in view of the fact that this system, in its 
view, is a heresy and emanates from other civilizations strange 
to us. In other words, it used the democratic game as a means 
to seize power indefinitely. 
  Parallel to this, the security situation had experienced a 
continuous deterioration. Public order became threatened and 
the public authority trodden upon. Anarchy and confusion 
prevailed in all sectors. 
  The very rapid deterioration of the political, social, and 
security climate led patriotic forces aware of the fatal danger 
facing the country to make a decision that consisted in putting 
a stop to the destructive tendency and declare a state of 
emergency. 
  Regarding the development of the situation since the 
installation of the HSC, we can say the following: The HSC had 
endeavored since its creation to achieve two things: First, the 
recovery of state authority and the creation of appropriate 
conditions for the return to a democratic path. 
  Regrettably, in its search to have dialogue with the various 
social and political forces, it came across obstacles set up by 
some political parties out of politicking far away from the 
higher interests of the country. 
  Despite all this, all the important social forces that 
represented millions of citizens took part in the national 
dialogue march that was crowned with a platform which clearly 
determined the rules of transition to a true political democracy. 
  The stretched-hand policy of all the Algerians who were 
attached to the constitutional system and respected the 
fundamental national values was interpreted as an indication of 
weakness by forces that have always endeavored to impose by 
force and terror on the Algerians a suspicious and fictitious 
system that can only lead to the destruction of the country. We 
all know what happened in the countries in which similar systems 
were imposed: Comprehensive regression in all fields, civil 
wars, flight of the elite, division, explosion, etc. 
  In our country, these forces perpetrate on a daily basis 
under the cover of our noble religion, which they interpret as 
they like, destructive, barbaric, savage terrorist acts. 
  How can one justify in the name of Islam the killing of 
innocent men and women of all ages, children, young people, and 
mothers, the killing of those who are in the service of the 
state, which is one of the major gains of the Algerian 
revolution that enabled Algeria to resist colonialism, the 
killing of veterans and the sons of the martyrs who are one of 
the major symbols of the recovery of national sovereignty, the 
assassination of foreign nationals who came to Algeria to help 
it in its development, the assassination of genius, 
intellectuals, men of science and culture, and even religious 
men and ulemas. 
  How can one use Islam to justify the destruction, sabotage, 
and burning of establishments, and public as well economic 
institutions that represent a national heritage, and which 
belong to all Algerians? 
  How can one use Islam to violate the sanctity of places of 
worship? How can one use religion to justify acts of assault 
and robbery against financial premises; and robbing citizens of 
their possessions? What is more serious than this, is to launch 
an attack against the honor and dignity of citizens, as whole 
families have become targets of vile deeds whose victims are 
women and girls. 
  How can one describe such barbaric acts as relating to Islam 
or what is called the jihad, considering that they are acts 
committed by an extremist, barbaric, and ignorant gang, who have 
been joined by offenders; criminals, thieves, drug addicts, and 
a number of youngsters who belong to families known for their 
dishonorable behavior during the revolution of liberation? 
  Unfortunately, there are some youngsters, among these gangs, 
who have been fooled by false propaganda and have agreed to deal 
in crime. This has caused great regret for their families and 
parents. 
  These crimes, which are committed in the name of Islam, are 
in fact crimes against Islam itself. It is true that a large 
number of people, among them people close to us, have expressed 
their sympathy with this tendency and have expressed their 
support for it. They believed its promises and held high hopes 
that it could usher in a better future. However, the sad course 
of events presented them with a chance to realize that these 
promises were actually deceitful, as their hope for a better 
life was turned into a horrible nightmare. The majority of them 
turned against this behavior whose perpetrators managed to learn 
from the Khmer Rouge, who were known for the destruction of 
their country and the annihilation of their peoples. 
  The majority of Algerians know what would have happened to 
Algeria had the election process not been stopped at the 
appropriate time. The leadership of this movement was also on 
the verge of experiencing an internal explosion under pressure 
from the armed groups whose hard core was hit abroad when 
working for the benefit of foreign causes, which would have led 
the country to destruction, similarly to what is happening right 
now in some of the regions of the Islamic world. 
  Regarding the political side of the crisis, the head of 
state 
had defined more than once the framework within which dialogue 
should take place with the social and political partners who 
abided by the fundamental national values that had led our 
revolution and also the constitutional system. 
  Today, our fundamental and priority task consists in the 
rapid consolidation of state authority and public order, as well 
as guaranteeing the citizens' security and properties. In the 
eyes of the state, this is not just a sacred demand, but also a 
fundamental popular demand. 
  This is what made us understand that our people had become a 
chosen target for terrorist acts. It insists on public 
authority to eliminate this plague. We will take this task in 
charge. 
  The means mobilized so far to combat terrorism have fallen 
short of the seriousness of the situation. We are also 
determined to further mobilize the human and material resources 
of the country. We are also determined to use a radical remedy 
to eliminate for good this plague affecting Algerian society. 
  In addition to the enormous means that the state started 
mobilizing, the citizens are also called upon to take part in an 
effective way in this fateful battle, within the framework 
defined by the public authority. 
  Our people are now aware of the danger facing their future. 
We have no doubts that they will wage the battle against 
savagery and barbarism. We are fully convinced that the 
Algerian people and its state will come out victorious after 
this test, as the people had always proven during its long 
history. 
  We will be victorious because we are determined that Algeria 
will recover its respectable position among nations, which it 
should not have lost in the first place, and that it Algeria 
returns to the path of its cultural, economic, and social 
development. We have every chance of success, and we will 
succeed with God's help. Peace be upon you.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The questions put to the 
interior minister Selim Saadi by the journalists present at the 
news conference in Blida on 23 March focused essentially on the 
general political and security situation in the country and the 
noticeable escalation of armed violence against people and 
property. In his replies to these questions, the interior 
minister talked about the phenomenon of violence and sabotage 
and said that 90 percent of these acts have now become criminal 
acts, and that those behind them want things to stay as they 
were. He mentioned in this respect the threats sent to the 
inland revenue authorities. 
  Regarding the number of individuals in the armed groups, 
Selim Saadi said that the hardcore of these groups consists of a 
few hundred people and that 95 percent of their members are 
known to the security services. He added that the others are 
carrying out operations under threats -- as was established by 
the investigation into the arson attack against the Electronic 
Industries complex in Telagh. This investigation led in fact to 
the arrest of about 60 people, including a number of workers 
from the plant. 
  In reply to a question on the release of some detainees from 
security centers in the south, the interior minister said that 
those people were not implicated in serious security cases. He 
added that Abdelkader Boukhamkham and Ali Djeddi [members of the 
Islamic Salvation Front] were only released after they had 
served most of their jail sentences. 
  Concerning the political aspect of the crisis, Selim Saadi 
said that President Liamine Zeroual has defined on several 
occasions the framework in which the dialogue must be held, with 
the political and social partners who respect the national 
values and the constitutional system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algerian President Meets With </F>
Leaderships; 'Group' Claims Responsibility for Frenchmen's 
Murder"] 
  [Excerpts] Algiers, Paris, Washington, Jeddah, AL-HAYAH -- 
On 23 March President Major General Liamine Zeroual held 
meetings with influential political and partisan figures in the 
framework of completing the "serious dialogue" he promised to 
conduct when he assumed power on 31 January. [passage omitted] 
  Hours after the murder of two Frenchmen in the Birkhadem 
area, south of the capital, France yesterday renewed its call to 
its nationals who do not need to stay in Algeria to return to 
France. [passage omitted] 
  The Algerian "Armed Islamic Group" has claimed 
responsibility 
for the two Frenchmen's murder in the Birkhadem area near the 
capital on 22 March. A statement issued by the group, copies of 
which AL-HAYAH has received in Peshawar by fax from abroad, 
says: "The Armed Islamic Group in Algeria claims responsibility 
for the murder of two French crusaders [salibiyyayn]." The 
statement adds: "This operation falls within the program drawn 
up by the group to eliminate any presence of Jews and Christians 
in the land of Islam in Algeria." In its statement the group 
said that the presence of the Jews, Christians, and polytheists 
in the land of Islam is a direct support for an infidel and 
illegitimate government which should be eliminated by the blade 
of the sword. [passage omitted]

has been encouraging terrorists in Kashmir. Washington will 
continue to put pressure on Islamabad not to encourage terrorism 
in the state. This was conveyed by the U.S. assistant secretary 
of state for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel, to a 12-member group 
of Congress-I MP's [Members of Parliament] during their meeting 
in New Delhi today. She agreed that a solution to the Kashmir 
issue should be found by India and Pakistan bilaterally within 
the framework of the Simla Agreement. 
  Briefing newsmen, Mr. V.N. Gadgil and Mr. Hanumanthappa said 
it was agreed that India and the United States should continue 
their dialogue to remove misunderstandings and misconceptions. 
The Congress-I MP's told Ms. Raphel that in Kashmir the 
political process could not be revived because of Islamabad's 
continued support to terrorists. She agreed that some hired 
persons were used by militants in the Hazratbal Shrine incident. 
The MP's told her that Kashmir should not be treated as a 
communal problem as Pakistan is trying to make out. Other 
members of the group included Mr. M.M. Jacob, Mr. Sushil Kumar 
Shinde, Mr. S.S. Ahluwalia, and Mr. Indrajit. 
  During her meeting with the home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, 
Ms. Raphel reiterated that the United States will continue to 
urge Pakistan to stop aiding and abetting terrorists operating 
in India. She conveyed her government's appreciation for India's 
transparency in Jammu and Kashmir. Ms. Raphel said the main 
objective of her visit is to clear the misunderstandings created 
recently and to place Indo-U.S. relations on a sound footing. 
  The home minister said that certain statements from 
Washington have adversely affected the ground situation in Jammu 
and Kashmir. He emphasized that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral 
part of India and the Indian people will not tolerate attempts 
to undermine the nation's territorial integrity. 
  Earlier, during her meeting with the head of the American 
Division in the External Affairs Ministry, she discussed the 
issues on which there are some differences in the positions of 
the two countries. 
  Ms. Raphel also met a member of the National Human Rights 
Commission, Mr. Virendra Dayal. Mr. Dayal told her that respect 
for human rights is central to India's ethos and traditions and 
the country is determined to uphold these values. 
  The Clinton administration's offer to Pakistan in return for 
a freeze on its nuclear weapons program includes supply of not 
only F-16 fighters but also P-3 antisubmarine warfare planes. 
This has been reported by the NEW YORK TIMES. PTI quotes 
analysts in Washington to say that the proposed plan will not 
require Pakistan to abandon its nuclear program. On the other 
hand, the analysts are of the view that the plan would 
legitimize Pakistan's nuclear program so that it could be used 
as a lever against India.

<F P=106> [Commentary by T.V. Venkatachalam, associate editor of </F>
NATIONAL HERALD: "Indo-U.S. Relations"] 
  [Text] India-U.S. relations have taken some hard knocks of 
late because of the remarks made by President Bill Clinton and 
American officials, particularly Ms. Robin L. Raphel, assistant 
secretary of state, on the sensitive subject of Kashmir. It is 
a matter of history that in the evolution of Western policy 
toward the newly independent nations of India and Pakistan, what 
was proper and legal according to the accepted international law 
and norms was not always followed. Cold War diplomacy and 
strategic considerations had their impact on the policy. Over a 
period of time, however, certain degrees of balance came to be 
restored in the relationship even before the Cold War ended. 
The big powers recognized that India has its legitimate 
national interest and this country on its part gave the benefit 
of doubt to those who were treading on its toes, conceding that 
it might not be intentional. 
  The recent U.S. statement questioning the accession of Jammu 
and Kashmir to India may not mean a change in the previous 
policy formulation as far as the U.S. is concerned. The 
American utterances, however, come at a time when Pakistan is 
engaged in a proxy war to destabilize the situation in the area, 
pursuing the same sterile policies which landed the subcontinent 
in costly wars in the past, hurting their people. In such a 
situation, India does not expect friendly nations to queer the 
pitch for her with statements that exacerbate the situation. 
For India, or for that matter for any country, it is a serious 
issue if its sovereignty and unity are questioned. The 
challenge to the fundamental facts of national existence cannot 
be glossed over with clarification and explanation. It cannot 
be that properly equipped foreign offices ignore historical 
facts. The circumstances in which India's secular policy 
rejecting the two-nation theory based on religious differences 
became an integral part of Indian thinking and ethos are too 
recent to be forgotten. 
  The whole range of Indo-American relations is marked by 
several positive factors. The two great democracies share so 
many human values. The potential for mutually beneficial 
economic and business cooperation is enhanced by India's 
liberalized economic policies. In the cultural, educational, and 
technological fields, there are long-standing friendly 
exchanges. These have to be strengthened at the political 
level. With due regard to each other's vital interests, it 
should not be difficult to find solutions to problems arising 
from the reactivated U.S. policy on Kashmir and the possibility 
of its supply of some deadly F-16 aircraft to Pakistan which 
will adversely affect the security situation in the subcontinent. 
  In the present context, it is a matter of satisfaction that 
there is an awareness of the issues involved and a measure of 
goodwill for India in responsible sections in the United States. 
At a recent hearing of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, 
American senators were appreciative of India's vital concerns, 
including those on Kashmir. Some of the senators sharply 
criticized the administration's handling of South Asian affairs. 
Those who were critical of the utterances of Ms. Raphel 
included Senator Hank Brown, Republican; the former U.S. 
ambassador to India, Mr. Daniel Patrick [Moynihan], Democrat; 
and Senator Jesse Helms, Republican. Mr. Daniel Patrick 
[Moynihan] who visited New Delhi last month and had talks with 
the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, sought to assure India 
that there is no change in U.S. stand on Kashmir and America 
believes that the Simla accord provides a sound basis for the 
amicable settlement of the issue. To the extent that they 
recognize the need to reassure India of their bona fides, the 
American explanations and clarifications are welcome. A real 
concern for India's vital interest, which in no way conflicts 
with the national interests of other countries, can help in the 
ironing out of the differences that have cropped up.

  [Excerpts] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian 
security forces in a number of Iranian cities and areas were 
placed on a partial state of alert yesterday following reports 
that armed opposition groups were planning a series of attacks 
on the occasion of the Iranian new year which begins tomorrow, 
Monday. 
  Informed sources have confirmed that the security 
authorities 
arrested hundreds of people in a major combing operation and 
that the detainees included a number of mullahs opposed to the 
government in Tehran, Shiraz, and Tabriz. 
  According to some other reports, the current Revolutionary 
Guard exercises in the Gulf will now be reduced to only four 
days instead of the seven days originally scheduled. The 
sources did not say why that decision was made. 
  An official source has strongly denied opposition claims 
that 
25 armed clashes occurred recently in which about 300 
Revolutionary Guard members were killed or wounded. 
  The sources said that most of the detained mullahs are 
supporters of Ayatollah Mir Mohammad Rowhani and Ayatollah 
Hoseyn 'Ali Montazeri, both serious candidates for the Shiite 
leadership. [passage omitted] 
  The government had some good news yesterday. It announced 
that it had reached agreements with Austria and Switzerland for 
the rescheduling of $1.2 billion of debts. 
  Iran has also concluded a similar agreement with Germany for 
the rescheduling of $3 billion of debts. Current talks with 
Japan for the rescheduling of $1.4 billion are close to 
conclusion. Furthermore, India and China have agreed to hold 
negotiations for the rescheduling of Iran's debts. That is in 
addition to talks with 22 creditor countries from Malaysia to 
Brazil. Iran's short-term debts are estimated at $9 billion and 
its total foreign debts are believed to be $30 billion.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Iran's commerce minister, Mr. Yahya ol-Eshaq, met 
with his Syrian counterpart, Mr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, in Damascus 
yesterday and discussed bilateral trade relations with him. In 
the meeting, the need for expansion of trade ties and exchange 
of goods between the two countries was stressed. The two sides 
also agreed that two separate committees--comprising commercial 
experts of Iran and Syria--be formed to survey practical ways of 
promoting commercial cooperation between Tehran and Damascus. 
  Another important point is that Iran and Syria--as two 
powerful states of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East--play a 
sensitive and strategic role in the trend of events in the two 
regions. They also have relatively common viewpoints on the 
events taking place in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. 
Based on this matter and also due to common stands of the two 
sides on such vital political issues as the compromise deal on 
Gaza and Jericho and occupation of south Lebanon by the Zionist 
regime, it is essential that the scope of political ties be 
expanded to also cover the domain of commercial relations. 
  During his December visit to Syria, Iran's first vice 
president, Dr. Habibi, met and conferred with President Hafiz 
al-Asad and also Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. In the 
meetings, Dr. Habibi pointed out that Iran has constantly backed 
stands of Syria as a country in the front line of combat with 
the Zionist regime. From the standpoint of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, this support or consensus between Tehran and Damascus 
is viewed to be an unavoidable necessity under the sensitive 
conditions currently prevailing in the Middle East region. 
Significantly, since the start of the so called Arab-Israel 
peace talks process, Syria has been under extreme pressure from 
America and its allies so as to divert it from the principled 
stand and to force it into accepting the compromise agreements 
brokered by America and Israel. 
  Dr. Habibi, who had led high-ranking political and economic 
delegation to Syria--besides conferring with the key Syrian 
officials on political events in the region and the world--also 
spoke of the need for establishing and developing trade 
relations between the two states. Hence it is imagined that the 
Monday visit of Iran's commerce minister to Damascus aims at 
pursuing the earlier agreements on commercial exchanges and 
including practical ways to implement them. 
  In general, regarding to Tehran and Damascus, it can be said 
that politics and economy are in fact two sides of a coin. 
Hence, enhancement of relations in one sphere makes the 
expansion of trade exchanges unavoidable. Talks of Iran's 
commerce minister with the Syrian officials too--in view of the 
commercial side of these relations--have duly stressed the 
bolstering of economic ties.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmad 'Uthman Jibril and Hasan Sandarusa: </F>
"Khartoum 'Convinced' United States Not Seeking To Topple 
al-Bashir Regime"] 
  [Excerpt] Khartoum, Washington -- The Sudanese Government 
has welcomed "the reorganization of relations" with the United 
States, announcing that it is convinced Washington "is not 
seeking to topple" the government of President 'Umar al-Bashir. 
  Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih yesterday revealed 
that 
Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will 
visit Sudan 31 March carrying a message from President Bill 
Clinton to President 'Umar al-Bashir related to the war in 
southern Sudan, human rights, the Sudanese peace negotiations, 
and the issue of democracy. At a news conference held yesterday 
Abu-Salih said that Albright's visit "will open the door to a 
Sudanese-U.S. dialogue." He added that "the United States has 
stressed to us that it is seeking to play a direct role in the 
peace process in southern Sudan." 
  He added that his country "is now convinced that the United 
States is not working to topple the government or obstruct the 
peace steps." He pointed out that "there are differing views, 
and the dialogue can bring the views closer." He expressed his 
hope that the visit "will be positive and bring ideas for the 
reorganization of Sudanese-U.S. relations with a view to 
achieving peace." 
  AL-HAYAH has learned from Khartoum sources that Albright's 
visit to Sudan will last two hours. Sudan welcomed the U.S. 
State Department's statement in which the United States praised 
the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development] initiative and welcomed IGADD states' commitment to 
finding a peaceful settlement to the problem in southern Sudan, 
urging the two conflicting parties "to seize this opportunity to 
achieve a settlement." 
  Abu-Salih described the U.S. statement as "positive." He 
said that his country "welcomes any support for peace." He 
stressed that "a cease-fire should lead to peace and more 
stability, not preparation for further wars and military 
operations." 
  Asked by AL-HAYAH about the diplomatic measures his ministry 
is going to take against the Ugandan Government after the 
revelation that Uganda participated in the delivery of weapons 
to the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, Abu-Salih declined 
to specify these measures. He said his government "knows the 
details of this operation, who purchased the weapons, and who 
delivered them to the rebels." He added: "Despite what Uganda 
did to Sudan, Sudan consents to Uganda's participation in the 
IGADD negotiations being held in Nairobi." 
  On Sudan's refusal to include the Hala'ib issue on the 
agenda 
of the Arab foreign ministers meeting scheduled for Cairo 26 
March, Abu-Salih said: "I hope that this will prompt the 
achievement of a strategic relationship in the interests of the 
Sudanese and Egyptian peoples and the Arab nation." He added 
that his country "has decided not to fall into a dispute over 
minor matters with the Egyptian Government." He pointed out, 
however, that rising above "minor matters" does not mean "that 
we abandon Hala'ib." He said that Khartoum will raise with the 
Arab League the issue of the war in southern Sudan "in order to 
take the right stand and secure an equation that enables the 
people of Sudan to live in peace." He stressed that his 
government "cannot negotiate on the issue of self-determination" 
for the south, which he described as "a malicious attept to drag 
the country into further infighting and fragmentation."

  [Text] All the warring factions in Sudan today in Nairobi 
signed an agreement for safe passage of relief supplies and 
humanitarian assistance to civilians in the war affected areas. 
The representatives, who met under the chairmanship of Kenya's 
Foreign Minister, Mr. Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, who is also the 
chairman of the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on Drought 
and Development] foreign affairs standing committee overseeing 
the Sudanese problem, agreed that the humanitarian and political 
dimensions of the Sudanese problem be treated separately but 
simultaneously. 
  The Sudanese Government delegation was led by Mr. Muhammad 
Khalifah, Commander Salva [Kiir] mayar dit for SPLM/SPLA, while 
SPLM [Sudanese People's Liberation Movement]/SPLA [Sudanese 
People's Liberation Army]-United was represented by Dr. Richard 
Mola. 
  Mr. Musyoka also said that the parties had also agreed to 
declare corridors of tranquillity to be set by the UN and the 
concerned parties from 15th to 30th April, May and June this 
year [as heard] to allow for vaccinations of Sudanese children 
under five years. The parties also said that the decision was 
necessary to alleviate unnecessary hunger and restore basic 
social services. They, however, maintained that humanitarian 
activities should be transparent and should never be channelled 
to warring parties. 
  The occasion was also witnessed by all IGADD foreign affairs 
ministers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Ummah Party Attacks Islamic Front, </F>
Expects Sudanese Negotiations to Fail"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Ummah Party has vehemently 
criticized the Sudanese Government, attacking "untruthful 
statement" made by the "Islamic Front government's" delegation 
to the Sudanese peace talks in Nairobi. 
  Mubarak al-Fadil al-Mahdi, official in charge of the Ummah 
Party's external action, criticized the delegation's statements 
that he is in Nairobi for the sake of "sabotage and distortion" 
with a view to thwarting the negotiations sponsored by IGADD 
[Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development] 
members. He expects the negotiations to fail. 
  In a statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, 
Mubarak al-Mahdi stressed that contacts are continuing between 
the party and "our brothers in southern Sudan, first and 
foremost Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's 
Liberation Movement [SPLM]. He also said: "We have always 
worked and called for stopping the devastating war in south and 
east Sudan and for stopping the massacres and ugly human rights 
violations committed in the name of the jihad by the Khartoum 
government throughout Sudan (...), and the government must stop 
the ongoing fighting immediately, instead of shedding crocodile 
tears over peace." He added: "We are not exploiting this dirty 
war in our struggle to topple the government of the Islamic 
Front and restore democracy in Sudan, because its fuel is our 
people on both sides and its victims are women and children 
(...). We are capable of settling our battle with the regime in 
Khartoum, as we have besieged it politically and socially. It 
is now besieged by failure and corruption." 
  He accused the government and "its party, the Islamic Front 
party" of aborting the "peace plan achieved by al-Sadiq 
al-Mahdi's government in 1989," and of choosing the military 
solution and making millions homeless. He said that the 
government "has not achieved any significant victory," pointing 
out that the "SPLM still controls 90 percent of the southern 
territory. And the Islamic Front has reaped nothing except the 
demand for self-determination, which it planted and fed by its 
alliance with Lam Akol and its agreements with the al-Nasir 
group in Frankfurt and the Netherlands." He said that the Front 
decided to participate in the peace negotiations after "its 
summer military campaign failed." And it alone is responsible 
for the death of thousands of victims and for the soldiers, 
officers, and Popular Defense troops scattered in the southern 
territory, west of the Nile, and who are dying of starvation." 
  He expects the Nairobi negotiations to fail, "because the 
National [Islamic] Front is offering Garang and southerners 
peace in return for symbolic participation in a dictatorial, 
tyrannical regime that is isolated and condemned internationally 
for committing the ugliest of human rights violations." He 
wondered: "What benefit will southerners gain from that?"

<F P=106> [Report By Sohayr 'Ubaydat and P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament Tuesday [22 
March] called on the government not to resume its peace 
negotiations with Israel until the U.S.-led blockade on the Red 
Sea port of al-'Aqabah is actually lifted and the lifting is 
announced at the U.N. Security Council. 
  The call by the legislature came shortly before U.S. Middle 
East coordinator Dennis Ross arrived in Amman as part of 
Washington's preparations to resume the next round of 
Arab-Israeli peace talks. 
  It also came against the backdrop of reports that a German 
vessel carrying general cargo bound for Jordan was blocked at 
the Tiran Straits at the mouth of al-'Aqabah. The ship was 
prevented from proceeding to al-'Aqabah when it arrived at the 
straits on Friday, shipping agents said. 
  Officials said the interceptions of al-'Aqabah-bound ships 
as 
part of the enforcement of the 43-month-old international 
sanctions against Iraq were one of the key topics for 
discussions with Mr. Ross. 
  The lawmakers' statement said: "The Jordanian Parliament 
condemns the continued American aggression against the Arab 
Nation in implementation of the American aims to control Arab 
wealth and serve Israel's interests in the region." 
  "It also condemns the unjust American embargo which 
continues 
to deprive the brotherly Iraqi people of food and medicine and 
basic services and the unjust blockade of the port of al-'Aqabah 
aimed at pressing Jordan through all means and methods to 
deprive its freedom of decision in all matters related to the 
Arab Nation," said the statement. 
  We request the government not to go back to the negotiations 
table until the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba is actually lifted 
and the lifting is announced at the U.N. Security Council," it 
said. 
  During a session of Parliament earlier in the day, Prime 
Minister Abdul Salam Majali told the lawmakers that the 
government was pursuing all efforts to lift the blockade of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  Dr. Abd-al-Salam al-Majali said he had met with U.S. 
Ambassador Wesley Egan Jr. Tuesday morning to lodge a protest 
against the continuing blockage at al-'Aqabah. 
  Dr. al-Majali referred to the repeated presentations Jordan 
made to the U.S. and the U.N. Security Council, which imposed 
the sanctions against Iraq following that country's invasion of 
Kuwait in August 1990. 
  He was replying to deputies, some of whom demanded that 
Jordan, whose economy is suffering as a result of the blockade 
at al-'Aqabah, refuse to abide by the sanctions against Iraq. 
  While that was not possible in view of Jordan's long 
standing 
commitment to international resolutions and decision of the U.N. 
Security Council, the Kingdom is following up on proposals which 
would do away with the negative impact on Jordan of the 
interceptions of al-'Aqabah-bound shipping, officials said. 
  "The process is continuing," said a senior official, 
referring to a proposal that the inspection of goods coming to 
Jordan be moved to al-'Aqabah port rather than the Tiran Straits. 
  The proposal, tabled during a January visit to the U.S. of 
His Majesty King Husayn, was reportedly received positively by 
U.S. administration officials, but the pace of follow-up process 
is very slow, officials said. 
  Under the proposal, an independent agency shipping unit, 
would carry out the inspections of all cargo being unloaded at 
Aqaba for violations of the sanctions against Iraq. 
  In his comments to Deputies, Dr. al-Majali recalled that the 
government had sent a strong protest to the Security Council 
several weeks ago pointing out that the inspection of 
Jordan-bound ships at high seas was illegal and was hindering 
the Kingdom's regular maritime operations. 
  Dr. al-Majali was asked by deputy 'Abdallah Akhu Irshaydah 
to 
clarify a report that Jordan had shipped 80 tones of chemicals 
to Iraq. 
  "For the best interests of Iraq, I prefer not to answer that 
question," Dr. al-Majali said. 
  Informed sources said the reported shipment was of chemicals 
for refinery. No further detail was immediately available. 
  The latest ship to be intercepted by the U.S.-led naval 
forces patrolling the Red Sea was the German Skyman, carrying 
3,000 tones of cargo for Jordan, said Ibrahim al-Na'uri, an 
official of the Gharghur Shipping Agency. 
  He said the inspectors kept the vessel waiting for one day 
at 
the straits before inspecting on Saturday and ruling that cargo 
aboard the ship was not accessible to them for inspections. 
  "They checked the ship four times since then," Mr. al-Na'uri 
told the JORDAN TIMES. "The last inspection took place Tuesday 
afternoon." 
  Mr. al-Na'uri said he had contacted the government as well 
as 
parliamentarians over the stand-off. 
  According to Mr. al-Na'uri, Jordan-bound cargo aboard the 
Skyman include steel rods, animal feed and general cargo and the 
ship is not carrying any goods destined for Iraq. 
  At least four ships were intercepted and delayed at the 
Tiran 
Straits during February in what was seen an escalation of what 
Jordanian officials and shipping agents describe as intentional 
harassment of al-Aqabah-bound vessels despite American pledges 
to address Jordan's repeated pleas for an end to the siege of 
its only port.

<F P=106> [Report by Ayman al-Safadi: "Jordanian House of </F>
Representatives Condemns U.S. Navy's Uncivilized Methods in Gulf 
of Aqaba"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman -- The Jordanian House of Representatives 
yesterday vehemently attacked the United States, condemning the 
"uncivilized measures and methods" practiced by the U.S. Navy in 
the Gulf of Aqaba as part of the U.S. pressures exerted on 
Jordan. 
  The House decided to issue a statement condemning what one 
deputy termed "a serious precedent which is an extension of U.S. 
arrogance toward the Arab nation." 
  'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, a center deputy, described U.S. measures 
in the Gulf of Aqaba as "an arrogant and uncivilized method 
which brings to mind the cowboy method which developed into the 
destroyers policy." 
  In a statement delivered on behalf of 20 deputies in the 
House's final meeting in its first ordinary session, 
Abu-al-Raghib said that the U.S. Navy "is -- with no 
justification -- sending back al-'Aqabah-bound ships after 
inspecting them in a manner that conflicts with UN instructions." 
  He added that this issue "has become a heavy burden on the 
Jordanian economy and Jordanians." He pointed out that European 
shipping companies have threatened to suspend shipping 
operations to al-'Aqabah port. He also said that the tough 
inspection measures are applied to Jordan, out of all the states 
neighboring Iraq. 
  Deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah, a former minister, urged 
the government not to return to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations before the United States lifts "the sea blockade 
imposed on al-'Aqabah." 
  Deputy Muhammad Dawudyah described the U.S. behavior as 
"muscle-flexing, arrogance, and encroachment on national 
sovereignty. It is an insult to us and represents a state 
aggression and state terrorism." 
  Dawudyah, who held the post of director of the information 
office in the Royal Court before his election as deputy, added 
that the "U.S. position reflects hostility toward the Arab 
nation" -- which requires "a pause for examination lest this 
hostile position on al-'Aqabah affects the peace issue and our 
national rights." he said: "How can we allow anyone who 
carries out all these actions against us to become a broker, 
partner, and sponsor in major issues?" 
  Well-informed Jordanian sources have told AL-HAYAH that 
Jordan is being subjected to strong U.S. pressures to force it 
to rush to to sign a peace agreement with Israel. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "United States Steps Up Its </F>
Pressure To Reactivate Jordanian-Israeli Track"] 
  [Text] Amman -- A high-ranking Jordanian official 
yesterday accused the United States of stepping up its pressure 
on his country and exerting political, economic, and media 
pressure to force Jordan to take rapid steps toward a peaceful 
solution with Israel "that is incompatible with its national and 
strategic interests." 
  The official said that Washington continues to impose a 
maritime blockade on the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah, and it is 
exerting efforts to keep Jordan in a state of Arab isolation and 
working to deny the Kingdom U.S. and European financial aid. 
  He pointed out that the U.S. Administration "stepped up its 
pressure" on Amman after Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
faltered following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron, 
with a view to "reactivating the peace process through the 
Jordanian-Israeli track." The official warned that these 
pressures "will have an adverse impact on the negotiations with 
Israel and weaken the chances of achieving progress on the 
Jordanian track." 
  A high-level Jordanian authority has said that the United 
States continues to impose the blockade on the port of 
al-'Aqabah through the search operations conducted by its 
warships in the Gulf of Aqaba, despite the U.S. Administration's 
promises to lift the blockade and secure alternatives to 
guarantee implementation of the economic embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  He pointed out that Washington "has since the eruption of 
the 
Gulf crisis imposed strict surveillance on Jordanian imports and 
exports to Iraq, without taking any real measures to watch trade 
exchange between Iran and each of Turkey, Iran, and Syria..., 
with a view to punishing Jordan for its position during the 
crisis, using surveillance as an excuse for continuing the 
pressure on it in the context of the peace process." 
  He pointed out that Washington "completely ignored" the 
stipulations of the economic embargo resolution, namely the need 
to compensate the other states harmed by the embargo. 
  He went on to say that the continuing economic pressure on 
the Kingdom and efforts aimed at keeping Jordan "without any 
Arab option and pushing it toward Israel will not serve the 
peace issue in the Middle East." He stressed that "it is no 
longer a secret that Washington is not satisfied with the 
rapprochement and coordination between Amman and Damascus in the 
framework of the peace negotiations" with Israel. 
  Meanwhile, Jordanian liberal deputy 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Kabariti 
has said that Washington insists on keeping Jordan "either on 
its knees or on the tips of its toes" to ensure that it will 
implement requirements for the peace process' success "in 
accordance with the Israeli-U.S. conditions." He stressed that 
the U.S. pressures, "which include media accusations of Jordan's 
involvement in providing military aid to Jordan during the Gulf 
crisis, will not change the principles and constants to which we 
adhered." He said that these "pressures will fail, just as the 
pressures exerted on us to participated in the Camp David 
negotiations failed." 
  He added that the United States, which "used to be a support 
for Jordan, has now become a burden on it, and it is no longer 
easy to defend U.S. policy in the region." 
  He defended the Jordanian-Syrian relationship, saying: "The 
time has come to establish a distinct relationship with Syria in 
the framework of balanced relations with the Arab states, 
without establishing one at the expense of another." He pointed 
out that in current conditions Jordan "needs an essential Arab 
rear, despite the attempts to keep it isolated from its 
brothers."

<F P=106> ["Arab Opinion" column by Mahmud al-Rimawi: "Siege and </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Does the request made by some esteemed deputies to 
suspend the Jordanian-Israeli talks until the United States, 
through the UN Security Council, publicly and practically lifts 
the siege imposed on the port of al-'Aqabah seem "exaggerated" 
since the negotiations are being held with Tel Aviv and not 
Washington? The answer is no. 
  The United States is the godfather of the settlement and 
negotiations are being held on its territory. Because of this, 
a U.S. delegation, led by Dennis Ross, is touring the Arab 
capitals to expedite the negotiations. The Americans themselves 
consider their role in the peace process a full-partner role. 
But such a partnership cannot hold when Washington is appeasing 
and blindly siding with the Israeli occupiers. It even 
pressures the Arab parties, including Jordan, under the pretext 
of its stand on the war in the Gulf; a war that ended more than 
three years ago and in which Jordan played no role. 
  As far as we know, several U.S. promises were given over the 
past two years to lift the unjust siege imposed on the port of 
al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only maritime outlet to the world. These 
promises have not been realized at all, even while the U.S. 
statements were praising the responsible Jordanian role on more 
than one level, inducing its role in the peace process. This 
situation dictates a legitimate Jordanian stand in the face of 
the violations, which threaten the rights of sea navigation and 
trade and which cause major damage to the Jordanian economy. 
  These challenges are not founded on international law or the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. They are brought about 
by a U.S. decision aimed at pressuring Jordan and influencing 
its steadfastness and stability. This will later reflect on the 
course of the negotiations, where Israeli intransigence 
continues on the Jordanian-Israeli track of negotiations as well 
as on other tracks. 
  Consequently, if Washington is truly concerned--and so far 
it 
is not--about the stability and growth of the Jordanian-U.S. 
relationship and for the resumption of negotiations in an 
appropriate atmosphere, then there has to be a swift U.S. 
decision to lift the unfair and illogical siege imposed on the 
only Jordanian port. It also requires pressuring Tel Aviv, the 
aggressor party, to abide by the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and start implementing them by withdrawing from the 
occupied territories, including the Jordanian territory. This 
will herald the beginning of a new age in the region; an age 
that guarantees the rights and interests of all parties without 
exception; and an age that ends once and for all the use of 
force or the threat of the use of force, as Israel has always 
done. Israel is the only state in the region that carries out 
military infringement and violations under the very eyes of the 
United States, and collects limitless support from it as well.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Will Ross's Administration Translate Words Into </F>
Deeds"] 
  [Text] Not much has changed since the last visit to Amman 
by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross regarding the siege imposed on the 
Port of al-'Aqabah and the losses estimated at millions of 
dinars that it causes. 
  The U.S. Administration has spoken in positive words about 
Jordan and its balanced and responsible policy. Yet this 
administration has not translated these words into solid facts. 
It continues to besiege al-'Aqabah, the sole naval outlet of 
this country which has endured the results of all events and 
regional and international conflicts throughout the previous 
decades without any justification or legal pretext. 
  Jordan for years has stood as a model state that knows its 
responsibilities on the national, pan-Arab, and international 
levels. It has continued to bear all the results of these 
responsibilities, in terms of its obligations toward the causes 
of the homeland and nation. It has continued to respect 
international norms, charters, and resolutions. Jordan has 
continued to bear the heaviest burden caused by regional 
developments, responsibility for which is shouldered by 
international and regional parties, led by the state of 
occupation and aggression, Israel. 
  Ross's visit to Jordan is a suitable opportunity to remind 
him and the U.S. Administration about direct and indirect U.S. 
responsibility for many problems facing this country, which has 
a sensitive regional position. What is needed is to expedite 
the translation of positive U.S. words about Jordan and its role 
into practical results, foremost of which is lifting the siege 
imposed on al-'Aqabah, Jordan's only naval outlet. 
  Ross's visit, which precedes the new round of negotiations 
on 
various tracks, is supposed to bring in new elements that 
justify the resumption of these negotiations, whose realization 
is blocked by Israel. 
  Certainly, we do not expect the U.S. envoy to ask for any 
concessions from us so the negotiations will succeed. 
Otherwise, this would be as if he is asking us to 
unconditionally surrender in the face of Israel's intransigence. 
In addition to the fact that we do not accept capitulation -- 
no matter how much pressure we face -- it is an established fact 
that a peace that is not just and that doesn not meet the 
people's demands to restore their usurped rights will not last.

<F P=106> ["With Life and People" column by Chief Editor Dr. Musa </F>
al-Kilani: "A Brainwashing Attempt"] 
  [Text] The arrival of the new U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan 
has coincided with a clever [U.S.] propaganda campaign which 
seeks to change the convictions of the people of this country in 
favor of Washington. 
  It is known that Ambassador Egan was the real dynamo in the 
U.S. Embassy in Cairo during a critical and crucial period of 
time. Robert Pelletreau, a Palestinian affairs expert, was 
ambassador at the time and Egan was deputy chief of mission. 
  In this context, it was not a surprise to see Carl Brown, a 
renowned U.S. historian and Middle East expert, come to Amman to 
give lectures--four in one day--through which he tried to 
convince our citizens that the Americans, including Schwarzkopf 
and Bush, are the new angels, and that the Arabs, including 
Saddam and Shaykh 'Abd-al-Rahman, should heed their message. 
  Twisting historical facts, the Harvard University professor 
denied that American culture is affected by the roots of Jewish 
thought, which believes in millenarianism, an ideology which 
requires that the promised land be purged of Arabs and their 
holy places on Temple Mount be removed! 
  Professor Carl Brown also attempted to undermine the main 
theme in Dr. Edward Said's writings, in which Said explains that 
the seeds of anti-Arab Talmudic ideology are implanted in the 
U.S. mentality and control its rhythm during times of political 
emergencies. Dr. Said also explains that the contemporary U.S. 
political course is a disguised, cunning extension of the 
historical Western onslaught against the Muslim East, an 
onslaught that began with the crusades centuries ago, before 
being developed into a European military, political, and 
demographic hegemony in the past two centuries. 
  In addition to the four "missionary" lectures, yesterday's 
lecture by Richard Armitage, a former deputy U.S. defense 
secretary, tried to convince us as Arabs that we needed the 
massacre of worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque to resume the 
Washington negotiations. 
  I have to wonder in astonishment: Didn't the Washington 
negotiations attain their highest impetus several days before 
the massacre? 
  Has the blood of the Hebron martyrs been forgotten so soon 
after 25 February 1994? 
  What is the political price that the enemy has paid? 
  Didn't UN Security Council Resolution 904 constitute a 
political and moral gain for Israel when [Washington] failed to 
recognize East Jerusalem as an occupied Palestinian territory, 
something which would later lead to considering it an 
indivisible part of the unified capital of Israel? 
  Our political stupidity has led us to a weaker political 
position after the massacre than before it. 
  Hasn't there been a change in the view on the Israeli 
settlements on Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim territory? The 
settlements, which were once viewed as "illegitimate," then as 
"an obstacle to peace," are now viewed as "part of the status 
quo." Furthermore, in a show of extreme political humiliation, 
the Arabs only demanded that the settlers be prevented from 
carrying weapons inside Arab cities. This is a humiliating image 
of submission which reminds us of the story of one of Timur 
Lenk's soldiers who stopped some Damascus residents in an alley 
and ordered them not to move until he comes back with his sword, 
which he forgot to carry on that particular day. To his 
surprise, when the soldier came back with his sword, he found 
them in the same place, humbly and submissively awaiting him. He 
killed them. 
  I believe that the U.S. propaganda campaign in Jordan that 
seeks to brainwash us into forgetting that millenarianism, 
includes the seeds of racist rancor against Muslim Arabs in 
general and against the Palestinians in particular. In terms of 
haughtiness, it is a Nazi thought. It is an idea Oliver North 
believed in, Jimmy Carter, the priest president, preached, and 
some U.S. policy planners embrace. It is the same thought that 
despises the Muslim Arabs for "desecrating" Temple Mount. Some 
of the preachers of messianism believe in the need to expedite 
the return of the "savior" to forgive their sins and to allow 
them into his Kingdom. According to some of their scriptures, 
this will not happen before the chosen people are reinstated 
over the entire promised land. 
  Here we say: The United States is the incubator of the 
criminal ideology targeting the sons of Palestine. The training 
camps of the Jewish Defense League in New York, Tallahassee, 
Nevada, and Oregon have supplied Kahana [movement] with all the 
money and men that it needed in the past. These are the same 
camps that transferred $3 million to Marzel, chief of the Kahana 
Hay movement. Barukh [Goldstein] was the first of the group's 
members to move to Hebron, and he will be followed by a second, 
third, and twentieth Barukh in the al-Aqsa Mosque, the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock. 
  I had hoped that U.S. Ambassador Wesley Egan, who is a 
seasoned veteran and experienced man, would have started his 
mission in Jordan by communicating to us a decision by the U.S. 
Administration to prevent the Defense League and Kahana Hay 
organizations from setting up their terrorist camps in the 
United States and to ban encouraging raising funds for those 
organizations through tax exemptions. 
  I had hoped that I would have seen a good gesture of lifting 
the siege of the port of al-'Aqabah by the U.S. warships, a 
siege that is aimed against Jordan rather than Iraq, as 
evidenced by the fact that Turkey is allowed to carry out all 
forms of commercial transactions with Iraq, as has been stated 
by Turkish Prime Minister Ciller. 
  The sons of this homeland, both Palestinians and Jordanians, 
are clever. The recent brainwashing attempts will be useless on 
them. 
  The blood of our martyrs in Palestine, Hebron, al-Karamah [a 
Jordan Valley area in which a battle between Jordanian and 
Israeli troops took place in 1968], Gaza, the al-Ruwayshid 
Highway, and Jerusalem has been turned into a vaccine which will 
immunize us against the arguments of Armitage and Carl Brown and 
the implicit and explicit techniques of psychological warfare. 
  When 'Ala' Hijazi and 'Imad 'Aql [Hamas activists] were 
martyred, both of them became targets of an intensive U.S. 
television campaign that sought to obliterate our genuine 
character through professional messages addressed to the 
subconscious. 
  However, the martyrs vaccine eventually prevailed, because 
Almighty God blessed this homeland when He said: The al-Aqsa 
Mosque "whose precincts we did bless." [part of Koranic verse]

  [Text] Amman -- Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has proposed that the Arab 
cordon [al-tawq] states participating in the peace talks set up 
an operations center to follow the progress of negotiations on a 
daily basis. This center, he said, should be supported by the 
rest of the Arab states in order to influence the position of 
the United States, which sees itself as a peace partner. 
  Speaking to SAWT AL-SHA'B yesterday before his departure 
from 
Amman to Tunis, Abu-Sharif said the Security Council resolution 
that condemned the Hebron massacre was general. However, he 
said, employing it appropriately according to a detailed plan 
may create more pressure for the evacuation of settlers from the 
occupied territories. He stressed that in the aftermath of the 
mosque massacre, the Oslo and Cairo agreements should be 
reconsidered and some points on the transitional and final 
stages should be discussed. 
  He admitted that the Palestinian and Arab campaign of 
protest 
against the massacre did not rise to the level of the event, 
adding that despite its tragic nature, this massacre was a 
chance for the Palestinians and Arabs to intensively pressure 
the United States into forcing Israel to implement the 
resolutions of international legitimacy.

  [Text] A minister has revealed to SHIHAN that the 
defendants arrested after placing weapons and explosives in 
al-Qasr, al-Karak, have strong ties with one of the leaders of 
the Afghan revolution. 
  The minister said security quarters found messages exchanged 
between the defendants and Golboddin Hekmatyar, leader of the 
militias opposing the government of [Afghan President 
Borhanoddin] Rabbani. 
  In another development, confessions by those accused of the 
recent explosions in Amman, the Jordanian Afghans, have led to 
the arrest of elements affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, 
Suwaylih branch. It was discovered that one of the group 
leaders is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. This leader 
confessed that one of the Muslim Brotherhood officials in charge 
in al-Baq'ah and Suwaylih was involved in the explosions. 
Confessions show this took place without the knowledge of the 
Muslim Brotherhood leadership, and that Saudi funds and Islamic 
relief organizations finance the extremist organizations, not 
only in Jordan, but also in Egypt and Algeria.

<F P=106> [Report by Kamran Qurrah Daghi: "Kurds Expect Iraqi Attack </F>
'Within 48 Hours'"] 
  [Text] London -- Kurdish sources have told AL-HAYAH that 
they do not rule out an imminent attack by Baghdad on Kurdistan, 
"maybe within the coming 48 hours." 
  Meanwhile, the Kurdish administration has told Western 
states 
that Iraqi military deployments on the front lines with the 
Kurds have assumed a serious form -- which points to aggressive 
intentions. 
  The sources expressed their hope that the coalition states 
would officially warn Baghdad against any aggressive actions 
against Kurdish areas, whose inhabitants now feel the danger and 
are worried. The sources pointed out that the Iraqis have 
deployed two Republican Guard divisions on the front lines in 
Chamchamal and Karkuk. They said that Kurdish forces are 
watching the Iraqi movements and expect any potential strikes to 
focus on areas situated south of Parallel 36.

  [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, Iraq, March 24 (AFP) -- The Iraqi 
Army has shelled villages and deployed 60 tanks near Kurdish 
lines in northeastern Iraq, Kurdish military officials said 
Thursday [24 March]. 
  The shelling late Wednesday close to the Kurdish checkpoint 
of Chamchamal on the road from the government-controlled town of 
Karkuk to Kurdish-held al-Sulaymaniyah caused no casualties, 
they said. 
  Kurdish district commander Khidir Sine said 6O tanks had 
been 
brought forward to the line since Tuesday, while an Iraqi 
helicopter flew within 300 metres (yards) of the demarcation 
line. 
  Iraqi forces are now less than 500 metres (yards) from the 
checkpoint. 
  A 300-kilometre (180-mile) stretch of the demarcation line 
between Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq and the rest of the 
country lies south of the 36th parallel, above which the Kurds 
are protected by allied warplanes. 
  Iraq has since the start of March built up troops and arms 
on 
the other side of the line, according to the Kurds. 
  But a senior officer who deserted from the Iraqi Army, 
declining to be named, said the soldiers along the demarcation 
line were "not in a fit state to attack the Kurds." 
  Their morale is low and the army's situation "desolate," 
according to the officer. 
  While ruling out a large-scale attack, Kurdish officials and 
representatives of foreign organisations said the army could 
launch limited raids south of the 36th parallel.

  [Text] Paris, 23 Mar (INA) -- Iraq has warned it may be hit 
by an environmental disaster from the continuing sanctions. 
  A memorandum submitted by the Iraqi parliamentary delegation 
to the 91st congress of the International Parliamentary Union, 
now in session in Paris, notes a rising level of pollution and 
the emergence of symptoms of previously unknown diseases. The 
Iraqi paper also notes an increased incidence of illnesses among 
women and children, including a higher-than-usual number of 
miscarriages and babies born with deformities. 
  The memorandumm stresses that extensive use of depleted 
uranium in the missiles fired during the aggression on Iraq may 
bring about an environmental disaster, whose effects will be 
felt for many years to come. This is in addition to 
environmental pollution from crude oil and oil-based products. 
  The memorandum blames the sanction-caused scarcity of 
finances and technical resources for the difficulties involved 
in destroying waste and maintaining a healthy environment. 
  The paper appeals to the parliamentarians to direct that 
living in a healthy environment falls under the human rights 
heading and that sanctions arising from political disputes 
should exclude substances required for the protection of the 
environment. 
  Iraq's delegation to the congress is led by National 
Assembly 
Speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih.

<F P=106> [Untitled editorial] </F>
  [Text] In the past, when the government became angry and 
annoyed with a high-ranking official and wanted to get rid of 
him, it assigned him to the Foreign Ministry. When that person 
was a middle-ranking official, he was assigned to the Finance 
Ministry. When he was a low-ranking official, he was assigned to 
the Ministries of Youth and Agriculture. What was the result? 
  When we needed bread, we found our agriculture destroyed and 
without irrigation; no one could plant in order to feed the 
people. So, the head of state, comrade leader Saddam Husayn -- 
as usual -- was forced to save the situation. He supervised the 
harvest from the beginning. He gave instructions to set up 
irrigation projects and build dams under the circumstances of 
the blockade. 
  What also happened? When youths were needed to stand with 
honor during the chapter of treason, they were the tools of 
implementation. When our economy was in a critical situation 
because of the lack of hard currency and the lack of dollars as 
a financial cover, and when we needed good economists and 
finance men, we noticed the cause of all that confusion was the 
economists and finance men of the Ministry of Finance and the 
Prime Ministry. As a result of this, the dollar exchange rate 
increased continuously from 54 dinar until it reached more than 
300 dinars. 
  Since the cease-fire -- praise be to God, the Iraqis who sat 
at the negotiating table with the Americans to reach the 
cease-fire were not the politicians of the Foreign Ministry, but 
a military group who fought in al-Qadisiyah and the Mother of 
Battles -- we can say the handling of Iraq's foreign policy has 
been deteriorating. Iraqis can say it is in a bad shape. Why? 
Is this the result of the current situation? The answer is no. 
Throughout the 8 years of the war with Iran and until the 
Mother of Battles our ambassadors worked in trade. One of our 
ambassadors to a Southeast Asian country had nothing to do 
except to trade in carpets, works of art, and electrical 
appliances in order to collect money. The main concern of other 
ambassadors in socialist countries was to profit from trade in 
the black market. Embassy employees who work in sensitive 
organizations and who are charged with security tasks work in 
trade. The other employees' primary concern is to live in free 
houses in the countries to which they are assigned and to obtain 
food at low prices in order to collect dollars to buy 
commodities for resale at high prices in Iraq. In one of the 
countries on which we depend until this moment, the ambassador 
has nothing to do but to take gifts from so-and-so merchant and 
to charge so-and-so merchant with running his own affairs. This 
takes place while their people are being besieged and need every 
honest effort to provide them with bread. The outcome is the 
escape of more than one ambassador who quit the service and did 
not return to the homeland of struggle or to their steadfast 
people. 
  If we assess the work of our foreign policy during the eight 
years of war -- in which each Iraqi house lost one, two, or 
three martyrs -- what will be our gains? Only part of the 
Jordanian people, three-quarters of the Yemeni people, and the 
very rich people in the Gulf were at our side? We now 
understand why the Gulf people's feeling were with us. Because 
we indirectly deterred Iran's danger to the nation. In other 
words, we averted the danger of fire so their money wouldn't 
catch fire and burn. 
  As a result, when we were engaged in the Mother of Battles, 
the Arabian Gulf states mobilized armies against us, directly or 
indirectly, and with their money. Part of Egypt, whose citizens 
were working in Iraq, stood by our side. The whole Arab Maghreb 
was against us because it believed Iraq had committed an 
aggression against a neighboring Muslim country. 
  Is the Arabs' love for Iraqis expressed by places that did 
not support us due to foreign policy? 
  The answer is no. It was due to Saddam Husayn who suits his 
actions to his words. This is what every Arab wants. He wants 
a leader who can talk in the name of the nation, who is one of 
the nation's best sons, and who raises the nation's banner 
against all symbols and idols that act against the nation and 
the liberation of Palestine and that led to the loss of 
Palestine. Those who travel outside Iraq feel the Arab people's 
love. The Arab citizen loves the Iraqis because he loves Saddam 
Husayn. Saddam is the key and Iraq is the door. 
  What have we won so far? Two people were playing cards. One 
of them revealed his cards to the other, placed all his money 
before him, and began to negotiate with him empty-handed. In 
other words, we surrendered to the United Nations. We agreed to 
everything. We did not keep any cards to negotiate with, 
including factories and weapons. We revealed all our diplomatic 
cards from the very first round. We agreed with them. But they 
were pursuing the Jewish mentality, namely, the take-and-demand 
formula. One of our comrades mentioned this point in a 
television interview. They asked just for one factory, then for 
just one piece of iron, them for just another piece, and then 
for just another item. We gave them everything. Now, we have 
nothing to negotiate with. 
  The United Nations understands only one language -- the 
language of Aidid and the Yugoslavs. The Somalis are a poor 
nation, and their best weapon is the Kalashnikov. But what were 
the results? The invaders left, although their armies 
outnumbered the Somali inhabitants. Aidid represents one trend, 
and the number of his supporters was equal to that of Ali Mahdi. 
After he entered into a conflict with the foreigners, the 
number of his followers increased at the expense of the other 
trends. In Yugoslavia, whenever the Yugoslavs want something, 
they behave properly with the United Nations and succeed in 
choosing the right way. 
  The best thing that can be said about foreign policy is the 
dialogue between two generations of Ba'thists, the pioneers and 
the young generation. Among themselves, youths criticize 
foreign policy represented by the person of the foreign minister. 
  The pioneers literally say: My dear comrade, so and so 
should 
be lauded for being able to work. Comrade so and so is more 
than a foreign minister, and our ambassador so and so is more 
than a foreign minister, but so and so is just a foreign 
minister. [as published] 
  I would like to relate to you the following dialogue that 
took place between Stalin and Mao Tse-tung. 
  Mao Tse-tung: Comrade Stalin, how many members should we 
have in the Communist Party of China in order to achieve victory 
and reach power? 
  Stalin, thankfully: Ten members. 
  Mao Tse-tung, surprised: But the members of our party number 
millions, comrade. 
  Stalin: I mean 10 members like Muhammad's followers.

  [Text] The rift that has taken place among the major 
aggression states at the United Nations over the unfair embargo 
clamped on Iraq is evidence of Iraq's success in effecting 
changes in the positions of these states, whose warplanes 
dropped hundreds of tonnes of bombs and ammunition over the 
heads of the defenseless Iraqi people. 
  When several states, including big powers, such as the PRC, 
Russia, and France, three major powers that enjoy the veto right 
at the UN Security Council, change their positions, this means 
that Iraq's steadfastness has paid off, and that the gambles of 
the United States and Britain have failed, although they have 
chosen to oppose changes in the new international position by 
forcing their evil wishes on others. The United States and 
Britain have realized that continued enforcement of the embargo 
was merely an impasse that causes whoever chooses to stick to it 
to collapse in terms of political and international positions. 
  As the leader of the camp hostile to the national yearnings 
and ambitions of other peoples who are not about to let go of 
their independence, the United States is bound to forfeit 
further allies, even if these belong in the camp of the second- 
or third-rate powers that, in 1990 and 1991, rushed to support 
the U.S. aggression on and siege of Iraq. America's loss will 
then be compounded and the United States will not be in a 
position to lead the world. There will be a dwindling in its 
international standing, after it had been afforded the 
opportunity to gain exclusive control of the world by the former 
Soviet Union. 
  The world Zionist movement and the United States wanted 
their 
aggression on Iraq and the sanctions to create conditions that 
would make it impossible for any other power to take them on. 
Such a scenario has certainly failed to materialize, but the 
Zionists and the Americans continue to pursue that objective. 
The credit for the failure of that goal to come to fruition 
must go to the steadfastness of the Iraqi people and the 
brilliance of Saddam Husayn. The forces of aggression assumed 
that where the comprehensive 30-state aggression and the page of 
treachery and treasons failed, the comprehensive siege would 
succeed. 
  Iraq's steadfastness and President Saddam Husayn's historic 
leadership are the most outstanding features of the 20th 
century's most outstanding and ferocious battle. Neither 
ancient nor the modern history has seen such a massive array of 
forces ranged against such a small-sized people with a 
disproportionately strong will-power. Iraq's steadfastness 
illustrates that the Washington-Tel-Aviv plot to partition Iraq 
and defeat its nationalist movement, led by the peerless leader 
Saddam Husayn, has collapsed, with the Americans and Zionists 
left without any viable forces to help them weaken Iraq's unity. 
  The split in the ranks of the world's leading powers at the 
United Nations is a heavy blow to the alliance, which had 
attracted 30 nations by trickery and misrepresentations. If 
there is a lesson to be learned from the split at the Security 
Council, it is that Iraq's stamina and pan-Arab and socialist 
and independent policies have won the day. It is such 
principles that have shielded Iraq and its national unity, made 
it a role model, and turned the siege into an ever-increasing 
burden for the aggressors.

  [Text] Baghdad, 23 Mar (INA)--AL-THAWRAH emphasizes that 
the Security Council should fulfill its obligations toward Iraq 
after years of procrastination, delay, and conflicting 
individual views that have no legal or moral justification. 
  In an article published today, the newspaper says: While the 
Iraqi leadership's envoy meets with the UN secretary general 
again to put him in the picture of the situation, he is aware 
that the UN secretary general knows how far Iraq has implemented 
its obligations and the nature of the effective cooperation 
shown by Iraq throughout the past years. The envoy wants to 
emphasize to the secretary general the importance of activating 
the performance of the international organization in a manner 
that ends the pressuring and dictating policy imposed on it. 
  The newspaper says the Iraqi message of facts that reviewed 
Iraq's commitment to the text and spirit of UN resolutions in 
accordance with the sequence of paragraphs of these resolutions, 
and the state of dismay demonstrated by the representatives of 
Washington and London, have accurately reflected the extent of 
infraction and insistence on harming Iraq and the Iraqi people. 
This also showed the extent of hatred and arrogance that is 
pursued by Washington and its subservient agents. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds it has become visible to all that the first 
and final objective is a political one, and that the subject is 
more than a commitment to the spirit of resolutions in spite of 
the injustice and haphazardness of these resolutions. 
  It adds that briefing the Security Council on the facts and 
asking it to abide by what it approved has exposed everything. 
Silence is no longer acceptable, and this has been recently 
echoed by several permanent members who admitted the positive 
Iraqi steps. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by stressing that this new change is 
based on Iraq's steadfastness, firmness, and the jihad and 
courage of its people in patiently enduring afflictions. The 
coming days will bring news about the greatest victory over the 
tyrant and the collapse of the siege of the unjust.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi: "Iraq's </F>
Unity Stronger"] 
  [Text] The press statement released by U.S., British, 
French, and Turkish representatives meeting in Ankara, amounts 
to interference in Iraqi internal affairs. 
  The four nations made unfounded allegations in an open 
attempt to justify maintaining the irregular status quo in 
northern Iraq. 
  It is universally recognized that conditions in 
al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, and Dahuk Governorates are the making of 
the allied nations of aggression that have facilitated the 
commission of murders, thefts, lootings, and the destruction of 
what Iraq has built over the years for the well-being of our 
Kurdish and Arab peoples alike. 
  The allied nations' brute force brought about a state of 
lawlessness in the north and in the no-fly zone, thereby 
encouraging rebellious gangs to wreak havoc in the region. 
These nations are directly responsible for the irregular 
conditions. They are meddling in the internal affairs of a 
founding member of the United Nations, whose laws and 
conventions the allied nations boast about upholding. 
  Shuffling the cards will not do. There is no reason why we 
should overlook the fact that the U.S. Administration and some 
of the allied nations are seeking to clothe their interference 
in Iraq's internal affairs in humanitarian garb. They are aware 
that their interference is unjustifiable and has a devastating 
impact on regional security and stability. Any attempt to 
undermine Iraq is in nobody's interest; indeed the last quarter 
century has shown it to be unavailing. 
  Turkey's assistant foreign minister Ozdom Sinberk's [name as 
published] remarks at the end of the four nations' session point 
to a chaotic meeting, where the double standard approach was 
obvious. The representatives of these nations advance 
justifications for their continued support of the rebellious 
forces in the north, retention of the no-fly zone, and the 
continued deployment of their troops on Turkish territory, and, 
in the same breath, contend they stand for Iraq's unity and 
territorial integrity. Concern for Iraq's unity and territorial 
integrity should translate into the hostile allied nations 
avoiding meddling in its internal affairs. Throughout history, 
Iraq has proved it can hold together and survive. Its people -- 
both Arabs and Kurds -- have shown that, when their brotherhood 
and sense of responsibility are brought to bear, they can sort 
out their problems for themselves. 
  Outside interference is illegitimate, and it can only bring 
with it woes and devastation, and jeopardize security and peace 
in the region. 
  Watching the session's proceedings, we are dismayed by 
Turkey's double-standard approach. How can Ankara note the need 
to lift the unfair embargo on Iraq on account of the enormous 
damage it has done to Turkey's and Iraq's national interests, 
while, at the same time, its representative notes the need, to 
quote the unsavory press release, for extending the presence of 
the multinational force stationed in Turkey to keep a close 
watch on developments in northern Iraq? 
  As a neighboring state with which Iraq has close bonds, one 
would expect Turkey to remember that its participation in 
illegitimate and illegal actions pursued by the Americans and 
their allies in northern Iraq goes against good neighborliness, 
the UN Charter, international law, and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey 
border treaty. 
  The Turks know only too well that only through effective 
cooperation with Iraq and reckoning with its national interests 
can they advance their national interests. Regional security 
and stability are hardly served by the aircraft and guns of one 
nation or another. They will only bring further outside 
interference in the region's affairs. The Turks also realize 
that the aggressive Americans harbor hostile intentions against 
the entire region, including Turkey itself. Any minute the 
Zionist advisers at the White House see fit to resurrect the 
human rights issue in Turkey, they will do so.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "Damascus Stresses Importance of </F>
Coordination `To Prevent Infiltration Harmful to All'"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Syria yesterday stressed the importance 
of coordination and consultation among the Arab parties involved 
in the peace process in order to prevent any Israeli 
infiltration [ikhtiraq] "harmful to all." It pointed out that 
Resolution 904 opens the door to the resumption of bilateral 
negotiations. 
  Syrian sources said that the Security Council resolution 
"has 
provided a new opportunity to resume the peace 
negotiations...and will prevent a repetition of the ugly crimes 
committed by settlers against Palestinian citizens with support 
from the Israeli Army." The sources added that "the strong 
condemnation" contained in Resolution 904 "is bound to open the 
door to the resumption of the negotiations, but in isolation 
from Israel's maneuvers, which nearly managed to undermine the 
foundations on whose basis the peace process was launched." 
  The sources said that Syria's eagerness to rid the peace 
process of the effects of the Hebron massacre caused Syria to 
respond to the U.S. Administration's efforts, "as represented in 
the telephone calls President Hafiz al-Asad received from 
President Clinton, because Syria expressed every interest in 
giving the peace process every impetus that is bound to make it 
a success and achieve its desired aims." 
  The sources added that Damascus's eagerness prompted it to 
invite the Arab parties to hold a coordination meeting next 
April to agree on resuming the negotiations. But they stressed 
that "it is not important for the negotiations to begin today or 
tomorrow. The important thing is Israel's compliance with the 
need to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy so 
that a just and comprehensive peace can be achieved." 
  After revealing that Syria has invited the parties concerned 
to meet in Damascus, the sources said that Syria "did that 
because of its absolute belief in joint Arab action and because 
of its awareness that the coordination issue and commitment to 
this issue mean denying Israel any opportunity to try to achieve 
another infiltration along the lines of the Oslo agreement."

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Peace and the U.S. Role," 
TISHRIN writes: President Hafiz al-Asad has received a message 
from U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning the peace process 
and means of promoting it. He also discussed recent 
developments with U.S. envoys Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk and 
the two officials reaffirmed the United States' commitment 
toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper adds: In fact, U.S.-Syrian contacts have continued 
ceaselessly since the recent Geneva summit. Washington has 
repeatedly voiced its appreciation for Syria's vital role in the 
peace process and paid tribute to its sincere efforts. 
  The paper says: After the Hebron massacre, the world became 
convinced that the only way to end tension in the region and 
establish peace is to put an end to the Israeli occupation -- 
Army and settlements, to return the occupied territories to 
their rightful owners, and to accept the objective and balanced 
Syrian proposals. 
  The paper notes what President Hafiz al-Asad said -- that 
partial solutions do not make peace and that the only possible 
peace means the end of occupation and the return of rights. 
This is the honorable peace and the peace of the brave. 
  The paper stresses that the events that have occurred since 
the signing of the stumbling Oslo agreement have confirmed that 
Syria was right and that the peace of the brave, which it 
advocates, agrees entirely with the UN Security Council 
resolutions and the substance of the U.S. initiative. They also 
show that without this peace, the Middle East will have no 
chance of escaping the cycle of violence and turmoil. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Undoubtedly, the United States 
has a principal role to play in bringing about the desired 
change in the Israeli position, considering the huge aid it 
gives to Tel Aviv and its patronage of the peace process and 
commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace.

  [Excerpts] Damascus -- The technical subcommittees stemming 
from the Joint Syrian-Lebanese Industrial Committee held a 
meeting yesterday in the presence of Engineer Dr. Ahmad Nizam 
al-Din, the Syrian minister of industry; and Lebanon's Nasri 
Khuri, the secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese 
Council. The conferees discussed topics related to developing 
and strengthening industrial cooperation between the two 
countries, and drafting the necessary decisions and 
recommendations that will then be referred to the Joint 
Industrial Committee. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, Nasri Khuri said: Today's 
meeting of the technical subcommittees is one of a series of 
meetings and contacts that these committees are holding to form 
the framework of cooperation and coordination between the two 
fraternal countries under the provisions of the Treaty of 
Fraternity and Coordination and on the basis of the agreements 
signed and ratified in accordance with the constitutional 
procedures in both countries. 
  Several committees were formed under the provisions of the 
Economic and Social Cooperation Agreement. These committees 
are: The "Joint Industrial Committee," which in turn has formed 
five technical subcommittees, which are holding their meeting 
today; the "Joint Agricultural Committee," which held its 
meeting earlier and agreed to establish a subcommittee for 
marketing agricultural products, and which will hold its second 
meeting on Saturday; the "Joint Electricity Committee," which is 
scheduled to meet today, Sunday 13 February; the "Joint Water 
Committee," which is discussing several matters relating to 
joint waters and which has already held two meetings; the "Joint 
Health Committee" and the "Joint Transport Committee," which 
also held their meetings. 
  The Joint Economic Committee, which has prepared a general 
idea of how to implement the Economic and Social Cooperation 
Agreement, will hold its meeting in the middle of next month. 
  There is also a "Joint Tourism Committee," a "Communications 
Committee," a "Committee for Facilitating Border Procedures," 
and a "Committee for facilitating Bases for Certificate of 
Origin." We are now in the process of forming a "Joint 
Committee for Labor and Social Affairs" and a permanent 
committee for planning. All these committees are operating 
under the supervision of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council and 
they submit their results to the Economic and Social Cooperation 
Agreement committee, which consists of all the competent and 
concerned ministers from both sides in the two fraternal 
countries, in order to make the necessary decisions on them 
prior to submitting then to the Followup and Coordination 
Commission. 
  We must point out here that within the framework of the 
Treaty of Cooperation and Coordination between the fraternal 
countries there is a "Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs," and 
a "Joint Committee for Defense and Security." This is in 
addition to the "Economic and Social Committee." These 
specialized committees, which are stipulated in the treaty, will 
begin holding their meetings in a periodic and organized manner 
in the near future in order to put the provisions of the 
cooperation and coordination agreement into practice and actual 
implementation.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Damascus: We Will Show Every </F>
Possible Response If Change Emerges in Israel's Position"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Syria yesterday stressed that 
the Arab parties concerned with the peace process will show 
every possible response in order to establish peace if a change 
emerges in the Israeli position toward the establishment of a 
"real peace" when the negotiations resume. 
  Syrian sources said that nothing would achieve "calm and 
relaxation in the region" like an Israeli initiative to withdraw 
from the occupied territories. The sources pointed out that the 
policy of "evasion" has achieved nothing for the Israelis so 
far, and some 27 months have elapsed since the peace process 
began. And "the occupation has not achieved, nor will it 
achieve, security for Israel. Peace is the guarantee of 
security, and peace depends on complete withdrawal from the 
occupied territories." 
  The sources said that the peace process between the Arabs 
and 
Israelis is now "at the final turning point: Either it will 
overcome the challenge successfully or it will fail," especially 
after the Hebron massacre. The sources pointed out that the 
Jordanian, Lebanese, and Syrian tracks have not achieved any 
progress so far, "as the Israelis spend their negotiations with 
the Jordanians talking about economic cooperation, not 
withdrawal from the occupied Jordanian territories." 
  The Syrian sources, which reflect the official view, went on 
to say that Syria has invited the parties concerned to meet in 
Damascus in the light of Israel's refusal to comply with the 
demand for peace and withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
The sources said: "If a change emerges in the Israeli position 
to move the peace process toward the establishment of a real 
peace, the Arab parties will show every possible response" when 
the bilateral negotiations resume in Washington.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Dennis Ross, the U.S. Administration's 
envoy to the region, has begun talks in Damascus on ways to push 
the peace process forward and end the stalemate that plagues it. 
His arrival was preceded by direct telephone contacts between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and between President al-Asad and 
King Husayn and President al-Hirawi. An agreement was reached 
to invite the Arab parties concerned with the peace process to 
hold a meeting soon in order to consider resuming the Washington 
talks in light of UN Security Council Resolution 904. This 
resolution strongly denounces the Israeli massacre at the holy 
Ibrahimi Mosque. It calls for international protection for the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories and for the 
concentration of efforts to push the peace process forward. 
  The fact is that Syrian-U.S. contacts have been active since 
the recent Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. 
The U.S. Administration clearly announced that Syria is playing 
a basic role in making the peace process a success and that 
Syria exerted major efforts to prevent the collapse of this 
process after the atrocious Hebron massacre. All members of the 
international community took the Hebron events and their 
negative impact on the peace process very seriously. This 
horrible massacre affirms to the entire world the need to end 
Israeli occupation of Arab territory and to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the Madrid 
formula and Security Council resolutions. 
  Israeli prevarication for the past 27 months has prevented 
any real progress. It is no longer acceptable on both the Arab 
and international levels. It is time for Israel to stop playing 
with its bargaining chips. Either it demonstrates real 
involvement in the peace process and a clear commitment to its 
bases and requirements, or it frankly rejects this process. 
Real involvement means, first and foremost, a firm pledge to 
withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace. 
Rejection will mean pushing the region to the verge of an 
explosion. It will represent a blatant disregard of all 
international efforts and of international legitimacy principles 
and charters. 
  Syria has always shouldered its responsibilities toward 
peace 
and has been loyal to UN principles and resolutions. It has 
worked with all its strength to make the U.S. initiative a 
success. On several occasions, it effectively contributed to 
rescuing this initiative from Israel's plots. The meeting 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva gave a strong 
push to the peace process. 
  However, instead of responding to the spirit of Geneva and 
its results, Israel intentionally cast doubts. The result was 
the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook the conscience of 
the world and confirmed the need to move the peace process 
beyond the impasse caused by Israeli intransigence. 
  Since the start of the U.S. initiative, Syria has made it 
clear that peace in the region depends on ending Israeli 
occupation. Peace cannot prevail if it does not provide right 
and justice and does not end Israel's attacks and its repressive 
and settlement practices. 
  Syria has repeatedly said peace and occupation cannot 
coexist. Partial and incomplete solutions that do not end the 
occupation and remove the settlements will not bring the region 
any closer to peace. Instead, they will push it away from 
peace. Indeed, Syria has stressed that such solutions are time 
bombs. There is no solution except a just and comprehensive 
solution that restores the territories and rights and realizes a 
firm and real peace -- the peace of the brave. 
  All events in the Middle East confirm the soundness of the 
Syrian stand and reinforce the international conviction that 
Syria's concept of peace is a sound, comprehensive, and 
integrated concept. The Oslo agreement was not only obstructed, 
it led directly to the Hebron massacre. Future developments 
will not be any less negative if Israel does not submit to the 
will of the international community and complies with the bases 
of the Madrid conference that stipulate achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict based on 
Security Council resolutions. 
  Syria, along with all the Arabs, are seekers of a real 
peace. 
The ball is in Israel's court. Israel must choose between peace 
and occupation, between security and aggression, between 
stability and settlement, and between becoming a member of the 
international community and the law of the jungle and the 
declaration of a war on human values, principles, and laws.

  [Text] Let's turn to Libya's dispute with the West. The 
two suspects in the Lockerbie attack against a Panam plane in 
1988 are reported to have agreed to go to The Hague to appear 
before the International Court of Justice on condition that 
Scottish judges are present. An official of the Libyan 
parliament, Sa'd Mijbir, who is visiting Paris, confirms this 
information to Adala Benraad: 
  [Begin Mijbir recording] A Scottish professor has proposed 
that the two suspects go to The Hague to be tried in the 
presence of Scottish magistrates. We have been informed by the 
lawyers of the two suspects that their clients have agreed and 
that they will go to The Hague of their own free will. We have 
accepted this proposal and we hope that the United States and 
the UK will accept too because this proposal paves the way to a 
peaceful, fair, and legal solution. [end recording]

  [Text] Damascus, QUDS PRESS -- An informed Palestinian 
source in the opposition Palestinian forces alliance has said 
that a delegation made up of leaders of the opposition factions 
arrived this week on an official visit to Tripoli. The visit is 
the first of its kind to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. 
  In a statement to QUDS PRESS, the source said that the 
visit, 
which falls within framework of the political moves by the 
opposition Palestinian forces to mobilize support for their 
positions that are opposed to continuing the talks with Israel, 
is aimed at discussing political developments in the region and 
the Libyan stance toward the current peace process. Libya 
opposes the self-rule accord reached by Israel and the PLO at 
the end of last year. 
  All leaders of the opposition Palestinian factions, with the 
exception of Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, are 
participating with the Palestinian delegation, which is expected 
to meet with Libyan President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi. 
  The source said that Jibril, who resides in Damascus, did 
not 
accompany the delegation for security reasons. He added that 
the visit was made upon an invitation from the Libyan leadership. 
  The Palestinian forces opposed to the Declaration of 
Principles are seeking to mobilize a hardline Arab stance 
against this accord. For this purpose, they have established an 
alliance which they have called "the Alliance of the 10 
Palestinian Forces," whose headquarters is in Damascus.

the salary of 'Abdallah Nasir, Yemeni charge d'affaires in 
Beirut, has not been paid for administrative reasons, not 
because he is originally from the south. The announcement came 
in response to a statement by the spokesman of the Yemeni 
Embassy in Beirut in which it was said that since the beginning 
of February the central government in Sanaa had stopped paying 
salaries to the Yemeni diplomats abroad who are originally from 
the southern governorates. The spokesman noted that this is a 
step toward division by influential parties in Sanaa.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
affirmed that Israel should return the occupied Arab land in 
return for a just, lasting peace. Israel should also 
acknowledge the legitimate Palestinian rights and abide by the 
UN Security Council Resolution 242 based on the principles of 
land for peace and justice for peace, Musa added. 
  Musa said the return of the Arab land, the solution of 
regional problems, and the end of the Israeli occupation of the 
West Bank and Gaza would produce a new situation with Israel. 
  In a statement delivered before the Consultative Council's 
session led by Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi today, Musa stressed the 
need to implement all the provisions of Resolution 242 for the 
sake of reaching a peaceful settlement based on the 
land-for-peace principle. This would also mean land and justice 
in return for peace, he added. 
  Musa pointed out that when this happens, we will discuss the 
economic situation, such as the Middle East market or economic 
cooperation. He said that Israel's place in this market depends 
upon the return of the Arabs' legitimate rights. 
  In his statement, the foreign minister said there can be no 
Arab solidarity without Egypt. He added: We always consult 
with the Arab brothers when we adopt any political stance. Musa 
noted: We always propose policies but we impose policies on no 
one. We must hold consultations before adopting any fateful 
decision, stressing that Egypt's role is known and valued. 
  The foreign minister said he will raise the issue of 
pan-Arab 
security at the Arab League ministerial council meeting on 
Saturday. He said Arab positions still diverge and there are 
serious threats from inside and outside the Arab world. He 
pointed out that Egypt is trying to ensure comprehensive 
pan-Arab security. 
  In his statement to the Consultative Council, the foreign 
minister said that the concept of pan-Arab security needs 
redrafting to be in line with the projected international 
changes. He said the concept of pan-Arab security must be 
broader than simply a bloc against any external aggression. He 
noted that the overall view of this issue must be wider and 
comprehensive. 
  'Amr Musa stressed that solidarity, cooperation, and accord 
represent the pillars of this security. It can never be 
established on enmity, Musa added. He highlighted President 
Mubarak's efforts to contain Libya's crisis with the West and 
end the events in Yemen and Somalia. 
  Commenting on the obstacles facing the creation of pan-Arab 
security, Musa said the biggest obstacle lies within the Arab 
system. He noted that foreign forces are impeding the return of 
Arab solidarity. He said that only Arab strength can overcome 
such obstacles. 
  Musa affirmed that Egypt does not accept the separation of 
north Sudan from the south. We can never accept that; this is a 
clear pan-Arab stance, he said. 
  Touching on relations with Iraq, Musa said: We differed with 
Iraq because of its violation of international, regional, and 
Arab rules and its aggression against Kuwait. The situation can 
only be rectified by returning to basics. Iraq must accept 
Kuwait's independence and respect its sovereignty instead of 
viewing it as the 19th governorate. 
  Musa pointed out that Iraq's conduct distorted the 
collective 
Arab system and created an Arab and international problem, from 
which we are still suffering. We must agree upon a cure on a 
clear-cut basis. The starting point should be Iraq's acceptance 
of Kuwait's independence and sovereignty and implementation of 
the UN Security Council resolutions, he stressed. 
  Proceeding to relations with Iran, Minister Musa affirmed 
that Iran is a fraternal non-Arab state the policy of which we 
disagree with on particular details. Iran is a Middle Eastern 
state that has borders with Arab countries. Discussing the 
regional situation requires talking to Iran as much as it 
requires talking with Egypt. But it is not part of Arab security 
or the Arab situation. 
  Touching on the Turkish position, the foreign minister 
pointed out that Turkey's position is different from Iran's, 
because ties with Turkey are good. The Turkish policy and 
conduct are linked with its cooperation, friendship, and 
relations with the Arab world, he said, adding: We cannot place 
Turkey on the same footing with other states that have problems 
with the Arab world. 
  The foreign minister reiterated that the Arab League's role 
can't be ignored or excluded, even if we find fault with its 
conduct. The Arab League is a mirror reflecting the Arab 
situation, he remarked, and its role is to discuss the actual 
situation. We officially asked the League to discuss the issue 
of pan-Arab security and an important study has been prepared in 
this connection, he said.

annoyance over the situation in Hebron and the violent treatment 
of its Palestinian residents, which is resulting in casualties. 
He said: Egypt denounces these actions and calls on the 
Israeli Government to adopt the necessary measures to protect 
the Palestinian people according to the recent UN Security 
Council resolution.

  [Text] Cairo, 22 Mar (MENA)--Victor Pasuvalyuk, special 
envoy of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, arrived in Cairo 
tonight from Tunis on a three-day visit to Egypt during which he 
will hold talks with Egyptian officials on the Middle East peace 
process. 
  In an arrival statement, Pasuvalyuk said that he wishes to 
keep Egyptian officials fully briefed on the peace talks, as 
Egypt is a major partner in the peace process. He added that 
Russia and all those concerned with the peace process appreciate 
Egypt's contribution to the peace efforts. 
  The Russian official said that he conveyed to Yasir 'Arafat 
a 
message from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in which he 
states Russia's eagerness to play an effective part in the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904 and 
reiterates Russia's desire to see the negotiations restarted. 
He added: I discussed with 'Arafat arrangements and practical 
measures that could help restore the situation to normal 
following the Hebron massacre, which we strongly condemn.

  [Text] Wafd Party Leader Fu'ad Siraj-al-Din has issued the 
following statement: Even before the blood of martyrs drawn by 
the bullets of Israel's monster in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque had 
dried up, the world was surprised by a statement attributed to 
the U.S. President that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of 
Israel. The statement was a shock to human feelings and to the 
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. It was also a 
flagrant violation of the international agreements on 
maintaining the legal status of Jerusalem and ran counter to 
U.S. policy itself, which meticulously refrained from 
recognizing the city as the capital of the Israeli state. 
  President Clinton's surprise behavior is an indication of 
the indecision of the U.S. Administration, which on the one hand 
speaks about peace and on the other pours fuel on the fire, thus 
inflaming the feelings of Arabs and Muslims who no longer 
believe in the usefulness of the new world order headed by the 
United States. 
  The surprise U.S. decision has swept away all the dreams for 
peace and stability in the Middle East. Its dire consequences 
will appear sooner or later because insulting Arab ideals and 
feelings cannot go unpunished. The Arab people are capable of 
regaining their dignity even if they are disappointed by their 
governments, who have adopted an impotent stance on the U.S. 
decision. 
  Condemning this unjust decision, the Wafd Party calls on all 
national parties, organizations, and forces to stand together 
against this impending danger threatening the Arab nation. The 
U.S. Administration must know that the voice of the people is 
stronger than it thinks.

  [Text] Al-Azhar Grand Imam Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali 
Jad-al-Haqq has denounced a recent statement by U.S. President 
Bill Clinton that Jerusalem is Israel's unified capital and not 
part of the occupied Arab territories. The shaykh expressed 
surprise and astonishment at the statement, which coincides with 
efforts to resume negotiations on the occupied territories, 
including Jerusalem. 
  Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq said: If the American President really 
made the statement attributed to him, then this shows that the 
American position is not steady. Such statements harm current 
efforts to resume talks between the Palestinians and the 
Israelis and talks between Israel and the other Arab cordon 
states, namely, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. 
  The al-Azhar shaykh called on officials to take a position 
if 
the U.S. President is proved to have made such a statement.

<F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F>
unidentified correspondents at B'abda Palace on 23 March -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you said.... 
  [Samahah, interrupting] Just a minute. Ask your questions 
one at a time. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, you said that [words 
indistinct] by the Council of Ministers to study the draft law 
on organizing the media. Since the media are still capable of 
broadcasting, is there a public pledge regarding a specified 
period of time for the draft to be finalized? 
  [Samahah] First and foremost, there is a pledge regarding 
the security of the homeland. There is a pledge regarding the 
security of the citizens. There is a pledge on freedoms. If 
you followed the statement properly, the printed media still has 
all its rights safeguarded by the law on printed media. The 
government's concern at this point in time is for our homeland 
to weather the storm blowing over it now. This storm takes us 
back to dark days. The government wishes to put an end to these 
dark days in every possible way. The government guarantees the 
rights of citizens to acquire information through the printed 
media at this stage and affirms that it will finalize the law on 
audio and visual media during its session on Tuesday, 29 March, 
and refer it to the Chamber of Deputies. This will give all 
media organizations that wish to continue broadcasting within 
the law the possibility to do so and practice their concern 
about freedom and the security of the citizens and the homeland 
within the framework of the laws that are being applied. 
  [Correspondent] Do you expect any security reactions from 
the parties that have been harmed by these decisions? 
  [Samahah] As a government, it is only natural for us to 
expect everything. This is why we have instructed all security 
forces, the Lebanese Army, the Internal Security Forces, the 
State Security Forces, and the Public Security Forces to 
continue their efforts in keeping peace and stability in the 
homeland and for the citizens. 
  [Correspondent] Is there any intention to arrest some 
officials? [question is not answered] 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] to stop the newscasts of 
audio and visual media due to one issue to [word indistinct]. 
However, there are some media organs that are abiding by the 
state's laws.... 
  [Samahah, interrupting] That is very true, but the law 
applies to all equally. We are at a very crucial stage now. We 
will finalize the law and within the framework of this law, 
media organs will resume their operations, provided they agree 
to function within the limits of the law. They will then 
continue informing the public through the audio and visual media 
by abiding to the audio and visual media law. While waiting for 
this to happen, the experiences of the past weeks and the 
attempts at shaking the stability in our homeland at this 
sensitive stage prompts us all to become more aware, open our 
eyes wider, join our ranks closer, and review all the methods we 
have thought about or practiced previously. We should go back 
four years in our memory to see where our homeland was and where 
it is now. The project for stability and unity in the homeland 
is worth our best shot and not sacrificing it for the sake of 
things, which though important, are not as important as the 
stability we are enjoying in our homeland. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] the public 
media [words indistinct] the private media that are disrupting 
the march of the homeland. 
  [Samahah] The private media that is disrupting the march of 
the homeland has no place in this homeland. There is no point 
in responding to it, because it has no place in the homeland. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what were your personal 
feelings when you announced measures stopping all newscasts and 
political programs? 
  [Samahah] My real feelings were a sense of responsibility 
before the danger that is threatening all of us. Have you not 
had enough of dodging shells? Have you not had enough jumping 
from one catastrophe to the other? Have you not had enough 
going from one sad mother to another? Let us handle this 
situation at this stage and we will all emerge in the light with 
greater joy. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, with respect to the security 
measures you have taken in Kasrawan, [words indistinct]. Today 
the security situation in the south is going through many [word 
indistinct]. Some circles have conjectured that perhaps there 
is pressure on the government not to declare the results of the 
investigations? 
  [Samahah] The same conspiracy is moving from one area to the 
other. The same Israeli enemy is moving, along with its shells 
and mines, from the south to the inside. We all have to 
demonstrate solidarity in confronting this scheme wherever it 
may be. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any practical steps to confront 
this situation? 
  [Samahah] I believe there are some steps that we have 
announced. There are some issues that will be implemented and 
the security units have been instructed to do so. In addition, 
the judiciary is proceeding with its measures. We shall not 
interfere in its business. The judiciary is performing its 
duties within the framework of the Lebanese law that allows a 
defendant to have a defense lawyer and to be tried publicly 
within the framework of the applicable laws. We have heard 
requests for public trials. All trials in Lebanon since 
independence have been public and will remain public. Before 
the law, all citizens have the right to engage lawyers to defend 
them. They have equal rights before the applicable 
legislations, which guarantee the personal rights and public 
freedoms. 
  [Correspondent] With the issuance of the law, what do you 
have to say to the representatives of the media organs? 
  [Samahah and correspondents speaking at the same time] 
[Words indistinct] 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Samahah] This is a decision taken by the Council of 
Ministers and I would prefer not to delve into the details of 
setting dates. I hope we will overcome what we are going through 
quickly. We hope the law on audio and visual media will be 
issued speedily, and we will come back and meet with you before 
these cameras. We shall not miss you in the meantime because 
you work in the audio and visual media as well as in the printed 
media. 
  [Correspondents speaking at the same time] [Words 
indistinct]. 
  [Samahah] Would you please listen to each other? 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you expect any popular 
reaction to the decision that you have taken? 
  [Samahah] I think the people are concerned about having 
their children go to school in the morning and return home 
without fears of explosions and without the various distortions 
we have been hearing recently, such as rumors and nerve-racking 
stories. Let the people have a peaceful time. People in 
Lebanon want to live in peace. A citizen is born in Lebanon to 
live in peace, freedom, and quiet, not to have the nightmare of 
explosions, fears, and terror follow them from district to 
district and region to region. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] I cannot hear you. 
  [Correspondent] [Word indistinct] in the south [word 
indistinct] for everyone. Radios and televisions provide 
greater coverage than the official station. 
  [Samahah] Who says so? 
  [Correspondent] I can see and hear. 
  [Samahah] I am also minister of information and can see and 
hear. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] geographically, the 
radios are very useful. If there is the possibility regarding 
the issue of the south only, [words indistinct]. 
  [Samahah] Let us not delve into this subject. No one party 
cares more than another about confronting the enemy and 
informing the citizens about the dangers of events in the south. 
The official radio, if you have been listening to it, and 
Lebanese television are covering all these issues. We call on 
you to cooperate with them in covering these events. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] former Prime Minister 
'Umar Karami regarding gathering light-caliber weapons. Has the 
implementation of such measures been discussed? 
  [Samahah] I believe that one of the duties of the Army, 
which has been deployed in all areas, is, as was noted in the 
text of the statement, to control all violations, including 
gathering weapons. Upon request from the specialized ministers, 
some new laws have been proposed to take into consideration all 
these abnormal events in Lebanon and make the citizens live with 
the legitimate government under the protection of the Lebanese 
security forces, not security islands and individual security 
measures. It should be known what sort of licensed weapons each 
individual has and how it is moved from one place to another. 
  [Correspondent] Has the speaker of the Chamber of Deputies 
been contacted and his opinion sought regarding these measures? 
  [Samahah] Are you new here? Don't you know that there is a 
separation of powers and that the executive authority was 
meeting today? If the legislative authority has a different 
opinion, it is the master of its own domain and will express its 
opinion on it. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the four of five who are 
said to be responsible of the crime? 
  [Samahah] The Cabinet has not issued arrest warrants. The 
arrest warrants were issued by an investigative judge trusted by 
everybody. Only two days ago, those who are now saying these 
things expressed confidence in him. Therefore, as part of the 
separation of powers, the judiciary is independent of executive 
authority, which the Cabinet represents, and so we cannot 
interfere in such matters and I have no authority to answer such 
kinds of questions. There is a judge who is doing his job and 
all Lebanese must comply with his orders. Once things reach the 
court, and I hope this will be soon, every defendant will have a 
lawyer to defend his case before the judicial council. 
  [Correspondent] You have not spoken about the situation in 
the south. Is there anything new in the message that the U.S. 
ambassador handed to Prime Minister al-Hariri? 
  [Correspondent] There is a reiteration of the U.S. position 
on the need to calm things down and a reiteration of the 
Lebanese position--namely, that calming things down will come, 
first and foremost, from ending the occupation of Lebanese 
territory and, consequently, regaining the territory and the 
having the occupiers depart. 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Samahah] The judiciary is pursuing all matters, including 
the issue you just mentioned, and no obstacles are stopping the 
judiciary. Today's measures prove that there will be no 
cover-up in anything whatsoever, that there is a functioning 
state, and that there is a state that has a responsibility 
toward its citizens and before history for the future of the 
homeland, and it will not shirk this responsibility. 
  [Correspondent] Did you discuss the 19 September [words 
indistinct] in today's meeting? 
  [Samahah] We discussed all issues. If you wanted to score a 
point before being stopped from going on the air, you just did 
it. Thank you all.

  [Text] Investigating Judge Joseph Frayhah has issued 
official arrest warrants against the suspects Jirjis Tawfiq 
al-Khuri, Antoinette Yusuf Shahin, and Simon Edmund al-Kharyati 
-- all officials in the Lebanese Forces and who are in already 
in custody. Warrants were also issued for the arrest of Makram 
al-Mursi 'Ali and Jerome Yusuf Diya. 
  Judge Frayhah also issued arrest warrants against the 
suspects Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd, the head of the intervention and 
protection branch of the Lebanese Forces security apparatus; 
Rushdi Tawfiq Ra'd, alias Nabil Fawzi alias Nabil Munassa, 
official of the same security apparatus; John Yusuf Shahin, 
alias Asad, official of the same security apparatus; and Vera 
Munassa, an official of the same Lebanese Forces security 
apparatus. They must be taken into custody. 
  The investigating judge will continue interrogating other 
people who are already in custody to issue the necessary remand 
orders against them. 
  Sources close to the investigation have revealed that 
several 
individuals now in custody have residence permits abroad and 
regularly moved between Lebanon and these other countries under 
various aliases, using forged passports of several 
nationalities. They used to enter Lebanon avoiding the official 
entry points, in fishing boats, via tourist areas, or by 
boarding Lebanese vessels on the high seas.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Lebanese Forces Commander Dr. </F>
Samir Ja'ja' by radio correspondent Kamal Tarabayh in the studio 
on 23 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Ja'ja'] My response [to charges of alleged 
involvement by members of the Lebanese Forces security 
organization in the bombing of the Sayyidat al-Najat Church] is 
as follows: First, there has been no security body in the 
Lebanese Forces [LF] since the dissolving of the militias four 
years ago. Second, what is taking place is an ethical, 
political, and media crime against liberties in Lebanon. Third: 
I have never heard of the so-called Jiris Tawfiq al-Khuri. 
Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a member of the Lebanese Forces 
before the dissolution of the militias. With regard to those 
against whom arrest warrants were issued, they left Lebanon more 
than one year ago. 
  [Tarabayh] Do you admit some of these elements were members 
of the LF before the dissolution of the militias? 
  [Ja'ja'] Yes. [words indistinct] I told you who were with LF 
when it was still militias. 
  [Tarabayh] Who, among the suspects, were members of the LF 
before the militias were dissolved? 
  [Ja'ja'] Among the detainees, Simon Edmond al-Kharyati was a 
member of the militias. Tony Ilyas 'Ubayd left Lebanon at least 
one and one-half years ago and is now in Australia. 
  [Tarabayh] What about the arrest of Colonel Fu'ad Malik, who 
is still a member of the LF? 
  [Ja'ja'] Yes, of course. I consider this a political issue 
which aims at striking at the people's belief in their 
political, social, and religious institutions. Tony Ilyas 
'Ubayd left Lebanon one and one-half years ago; Rushdi Tawfiq 
left Lebanon three years ago; and John Yusuf Shahin left Lebanon 
one year ago. Documents will be presented about the places of 
residence of those persons: Two in Australia and one in Canada. 
This will prove they have not returned to Lebanon since their 
departure. 
  [Tarabayh] It has been reported that LF security was 
certainly infiltrated by the Israeli Mosad. Do you admit this? 
  [Ja'ja'] Never. 
  [Tarabayh] It is said that former members of LF security 
were 
trained by and had good links with the Israeli Mosad. These are 
facts. 
  [Ja'ja'] I ask for public trials and defense lawyers. 
Investigations will reveal all facts to public opinion and the 
media. 
  [Tarabayh] What are the steps to be taken by the LF in light 
of this situation? 
  [Ja'ja'] We will demand public trials to see who is right. 
  [Tarabayh] What is the situation now in Ghidras? 
  [Ja'ja'] The situation has not changed. There are more 
restrictions on people coming to Ghidras. 
  [Tarabayh] Thank you, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'.

  [Text] In response to the arrest warrants issued against 
those accused in connection with the explosion at the Sayyidat 
al-Najat Church, which noted that some of them belong to the 
Lebanese Forces [LF], and to the detention of Fu'ad Malik, head 
of the Administrative Committee of the Lebanese Forces Party, LF 
Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' held a news conference this evening 
in which he rejected the accusation of LF involvement in the 
explosion. 
  He explained that the warrants were issued in absentia since 
those accused have been abroad for a long time. Anyone can get 
in contact with them and ask them. I have never heard of two of 
the accused, who have been said to be members of the LF. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' maintained that the detention of Fu'ad Malik is 
political. He hoped that he will be allowed to appoint a 
defense lawyer, according to law and logic. Dr. Ja'ja' renewed 
his call for open trials immediately. He affirmed that he is 
ready for anything. He also affirmed that the truth will come 
out and justice will take its course. He said: We are 
reassured about our situation. We are very confident, and our 
conscience is free. 
  The LF commander said: If they want to stop the LF from 
exercising its political activity, let them try a much easier 
way. Let them stop the LF without going to all this trouble and 
misleading the public. 
  Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed that pressure, accusations, and such 
measures will not change the convictions of the LF.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Lebanese Forces central media </F>
apparatus on 22 March--read by announcer] 
  [Excerpt] Some mass media have tended in the past few days 
to publish information citing unknown and undeclared sources 
concerning the ongoing investigations into the explosions that 
recently targeted the Lebanese people. 
  After returning to the competent judicial authorities to 
ascertain the validity of the circulated and published reports, 
rumors, leaks, details, names, accusations, and fabricated 
scenarios, the Lebanese Forces were assured they were false. 
  Hence the appeal to the mass media to beware the risks 
involved in falling for misleading falsification campaigns being 
launched against the forces and other spiritual and partisan 
quarters. They stress that the mass media should shoulder their 
nationalist responsibility in such critical circumstances by 
refraining from publishing any reports or information unless 
they are issued by the competent judicial authorities who have 
the legal authorization to comment on the progress of the 
ongoing investigations. 
  If such assaults continue against Lebanese Forces' officials 
and individuals, the forces regret that they will be compelled 
to take the legal action necessary to preserve their rights, 
particularly moral rights, against anyone who indulges in 
falsification, distortion, and libel campaigns or false 
accusations. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Progress has been made in the talks between 
Israel and the PLO in Cairo. Negotiations on the issue of 
protection for the Palestinians in Hebron may be completed by 
the end of the week. This was stated by Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres stated yesterday at the end of a meeting with U.S. peace 
talks coordinator Dennis Ross. Peres stressed that before it 
proceeds to promote the Syrian track, Israel must reach an 
agreement with the Palestinians about the continuation of the 
peace process. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] By the end of the week the 
Israeli and PLO delegations meeting in Cairo will conclude the 
elements of the Hebron package which will enable the resumption 
of the negotiations on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres assessed last night. 
According to reports received in Jerusalem from the delegation 
headed by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Foreign Ministry 
Director General Uri Savir, progress has been made in the two 
main issues -- the urban police force in Hebron and the nature 
of the international presence -- but no agreement has yet been 
reached. 
  At this point, it seems that Peres will not go to Cairo to 
confer with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. However, one person who 
will be going to Cairo is U.S. peace talks coordinator Dennis 
Ross. After meeting him last night, Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres commented on Israel's priorities in the peace process. 
  [Peres] If we reach an agreement with the Palestinians, the 
Syrian track will open. First of all, we must attain an 
agreement with the Palestinians and overcome all the unsolved 
problems. I think all of us will make a supreme effort to 
overcome them. We will see what happens in the next few days. 
  [Segal] In his meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, 
Ross said he had found in Tunis a totally different 'Arafat than 
a week ago. 'Arafat is sure of himself, feels encouraged, and 
is prepared to make decisions, Ross told the Israelis. 
  The Syrian track did not come up in the meeting of the 
Israeli and U.S. teams, but only in the tete-a-tete meeting 
between Ross and Rabin. The impression is that Ross did not 
bring any dramatic tidings on the Syrian track. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 24 March 
carries an interview By Gid'on Remez with Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin recorded after his meeting with Ross. Asked whether he 
shares the U.S. assessment about an imminent resumption of the 
peace negotiations, Rabin says: "First of all, I can tell you 
that the negotiations and dialogue in Cairo are a fact. Second, 
the U.S. peace team headed by Dennis Ross informed us that the 
Arab countries consent to resume the negotiations in Washington 
by the end of April, or maybe earlier." 
  [Asked whether the issue of an international presence in the 
territories has been settled, the prime minister says: "I will 
not go into details before the dialogue in Cairo is completed." 
  [Asked whether he is apprehensive that the Russians might 
attribute to themselves the success of resuming the process, 
Rabin replies: "I very much hope the process will resume by the 
end of April."] 
  [A report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer on 
pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 24 
March adds that Ross quoted al-Asad as having told him that "if 
Rabin wants peace in the northern border and the military 
operations against Israel to stop, he must reach a comprehensive 
settlement of the conflict in the region with Syria." 
  [Al-Asad went on to say that he is trying to curb Hizballah 
and the Palestinian organizations operating against Israel, but 
he cannot promise an "hermetical closure" of the northern border 
against activities from Lebanon. 
  [Ross is reported to have told his Israeli counterparts that 
"al-Asad is aware of the fact that the time left to reach an 
arrangement in the region is running out."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says that there is 
still a gap between Israel and the PLO and between the PLO and 
the people it is supposed to represent. According to Peres, PLO 
leaders say that the PLO gap with the local population is in the 
territories. We must take this argument seriously, he says, and 
enable the PLO to go on representing the Palestinian peace camp. 
Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports: 
  [Begin Peres recording] I intend to turn the agreement with 
the PLO into reality. Many wonder about my support for 'Arafat. 
I do not support 'Arafat because he is who he is, but because 
he wants peace. I support peace, and 'Arafat today is one of 
the means to attain peace. We must act rapidly and reach 
conclusions. There is no sense in procrastinating since we gain 
nothing from it. Human lives are destroyed and the human soul 
is also ruined. 
  Some people ask: Do we not have the right to live in Hebron? 
Well, we have the right to live in Hebron. Some say: Are Jews 
not allowed to live in Hebron? Well, we can live in Hebron. 
The problem is not one of rights but of blood. 
  When peace is attained, I have no doubt that Jews will be 
able to move and live in Hebron. Today it is not a question of 
moving or living there, but of confrontation and death. It is 
the government's duty to lower the level of friction. In the 
present situation, which is so emotionally charged, imagine that 
Arab residents of Israel were to buy a plot of land near the 
great synagogue in Jerusalem or near the Karmel market in Tel 
Aviv. How would Israelis react? We must take a realistic look 
at the situation. Attitudes must change before we decide on the 
final location. [sentence as heard] [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 24 March 
adds: "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres noted that hatred and 
hostility keep growing in the territories, and the Army cannot 
prevent it. He believes that politicians must make courageous 
decisions, should not pass the buck to the military level, and 
should not insist that the Army cope with an impossible, no-win 
situation."]

  [Text] A 20-year-old Syrian soldier has defected to Israel 
and asked for political asylum. This was learned by our 
correspondent Qobi Mandel, and he is on the phone with the 
initial details: 
  The 20-year-old Syrian soldier, Jasim Khadir, was captured 
two days ago on the Israeli-Syrian border after he crossed the 
border fence. The soldier underwent commando training with 
al-Sa'iqah, a pro-Syrian organization. He told his 
interrogators that he decided to defect to Israel and ask for 
political asylum here because he was mistreated by his Syrian 
commander, a ranking Major. My commander deprived me of my 
military rights, he said today in the 'Akko Magistrates Court. 
  The representative of the Minorities Squad of the Galilee 
District Police said at the court that the soldier's version 
still needs to be verified through the appropriate channels. 
Justice Faris Falah accepted the police request, and ordered 
that the Syrian soldier's remand to custody be extended by 15 
days.

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq today testified before 
the Shamgar Commission on the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. 
Baraq said the massacre in Hebron fell on the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] like a bolt from the blue and was totally 
unexpected. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Amsalem] The chief of staff's testimony 
is continuing now behind closed doors, and this will bring to an 
end today's proceedings. This morning the chief of staff also 
testified for two hours behind closed doors. Baraq's public 
testimony also lasted for two hours. Baraq's testimony was 
fluent, firm, and extremely lucid. He said the IDF is acting on 
the basis of what it estimates to be reasonable and expected. A 
massacre is not an event that the Army could have prepared 
itself for. A bolt out of the blue -- this is how Baraq termed 
the incident. Baraq said that the security procedures at the 
cave where good, but even so the massacre could not have been 
prevented -- rather only minimized -- had these procedures been 
adhered to. 
  The chief of staff opened his public testimony with an 
hour-long review of the situation. The first part dealt with 
the situation in the territories; the threat of terrorism, 
dangers stemming from terrorist acts, and the pursuit of 
fugitives. Baraq said this situation has exacerbated since the 
beginning of the intifadah, and that things got even worse after 
the Oslo agreement and in the wake of the political process. 
During all this time the IDF has initiated an active campaign 
against Palestinian terrorism. The chief of staff said this was 
the IDF's main mission in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, 
as he himself and the defense minister have explained to all the 
Army echelons. The chief of staff said that Colonel Me'ir 
Kalifi, Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, and Major General Dani Yatom 
are the officers in charge of the struggle on the ground -- and 
these three were also the three senior IDF witnesses at the 
Shamgar Commission. The chief of staff defined their work as 
complicated and difficult. 
  During the second part of his review the chief of staff 
explained the IDF's open-fire orders. He said they were 
formulated by the General Staff and approved at the most senior 
legal levels. He said they have not been changed in terms of 
law or principles, but there have been adaptations to new 
situations on the ground. Baraq said the measures adopted by 
the soldiers on the ground were also kept proportional to the 
dangers confronting them. Baraq said the orders left a large 
room of discretion for the soldiers on the ground. The Army 
chose to simplify the orders rather than going into the fine 
details of hypothetical situations, as was deemed appropriate by 
jurists. 
  The chief of staff said that there was no order not to fire 
at Jews. Let us hear how Baraq described this issue: 
  [Baraq] In no case is there, nor can there be, an IDF order 
saying it is forbidden to fire at a settler even if he is 
directing gunfire at other people or at the soldiers. On the 
contrary, there is an order relating to life-threatening 
situations explicitly stating the opposite. If there was a 
misunderstanding -- and from some of the testimony it appears 
some people did misunderstand the orders -- it could have 
stemmed from misunderstanding answers given to soldiers during 
briefings. This issue should indeed be investigated, and 
normally we would have thoroughly investigated it by ourselves. 
Now I am not certain we should do so, in view of the fact that 
the issue is being examined by this commission of inquiry, among 
others. 
  [Amsalem] The chief of staff said no briefings are held in 
anticipation of a massacre. This is how Baraq defined the 
massacre: 
  [Baraq] All this is not required for a massacre. Here 
everything is clear: A massacre is a massacre is a massacre. 
There is no need for special orders or directives to know what 
has to be done in such cases. 
  [Amsalem] Baraq said the misunderstanding of the orders 
stemmed either from the briefings or from temporary procedures 
introduced several months ago regarding imposing the law on 
Israelis in the territories. These procedures included a clause 
dealing with directing shots at Israelis. The chief of staff 
said these procedures did not deal with life-threatening 
situations. 
  Baraq said that in the six years of the intifadah there has 
not been even one case in which a soldier saw an Israeli 
shooting without a reason. There were no fatalities stemming 
from criminal acts perpetrated in the presence of soldiers. The 
chief of staff finished his review with a comparison of the IDF 
with the French Army fighting in Algeria. He said the problems 
were somewhat similar; in Algiers, however, the French Army 
suffered a moral deterioration, whereas the IDF is trying to 
preserve moral standards. 
  After Baraq's review ended, the questions started. Justice 
al-Zu'bi wanted to find out if the chief of staff bears 
responsibility for the massacre. Baraq said he bears the 
overall responsibility, but the chief of staff's responsibility 
detracts nothing from the responsibility borne by any officer 
regarding his sphere of command and concrete responsibility -- 
this is how the chief of staff differentiated between his 
responsibility and that of the officers on the ground. 
  Answering another question regarding the settlers' right to 
bring weapons into the cave, Baraq said there was no room to 
change this, because there was no concrete warning regarding 
dangers posed by Jews: 
  [Baraq] We did not expect a murder by such a lunatic, we did 
not expect this sort of action. We did not conceive of the 
possibility of such an action. I am afraid that in order to be 
honest with ourselves we must state that such a suicidal and 
determined lunatic can murder people; he can murder Israeli 
citizens and Palestinian Arabs. In other places in the world 
such a lunatic can carry out mass massacres, shoot down 
jetliners, or murder the president of a superpower who is 
guarded by an entire secret service. I think we should have no 
illusions regarding what we cannot accomplish. I think it is 
impractical to act on the assumption that the IDF or any other 
element can come up with a foolproof security plan which would 
give a complete answer to any coldblooded or lunatic suicide 
attack. 
  [Amsalem] Answering a question posed by commission member 
Menahem Ya'ari, the chief of staff expressed reservations about 
comments made by Yisra'el Bluementhal, head of Hebron's home 
guard, who issued the IDF weapons to Goldstein. Bluementhal 
defined the massacre as a battle. The chief of staff ended his 
public appearance by stating that in the restrictions under 
which it is operating, the IDF is imposing law and order in an 
even-handed fashion. [end recording]

  [Text] Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the Central 
Command, has said that the operation in Hebron is still under 
way and that the search of the house in which the terrorists 
entrenched themselves is not yet over. He said that in the 
course of the battle he spotted the bodies of three terrorists 
through his binoculars, while another soldier reported that he 
had killed a terrorist on the first evening of the battle. 
  Maj. Gen. Yatom added that the troops are operating 
carefully 
to avoid hitting local inhabitants and exposing IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers to unnecessary danger. He pointed out 
that antitank rockets were only fired at the building occupied 
by the terrorists. He further told our correspondent Moti Amir 
that the three soldiers who were lightly injured two days ago 
had been hit when a soldier accidentally dropped his machine gun. 
  [A report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin on page A2 
of 
Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 24 March adds that Maj. Gen. 
Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of IDF troops in the West Bank, and 
Colonel Me'ir Kalifi, commander of the Hebron Brigade, were 
wounded in the operation yesterday. Mufaz, who commanded the 
operation, was injured "very lightly," while Kalifi sustained 
"light" injuries. Both of them were hit by shrapnel ricocheting 
from a door frame. The report goes on to say that a total of 
seven soldiers were lightly injured in the operation by bullets 
and shrapnel.] 
  Gen. Yatom went on to say that none of the terrorists turned 
themselves in despite repeated pleas by Hebron notables.

<F P=106> [Report by Eytan Rabin and Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] Last weekend, Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander 
of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops in Judaea and Samaria, 
instructed the commander of the Hebron battalion to ask Uri 
Qrasan, the security officer of the Jewish settlement in Hebron, 
to provide him with specifics regarding the measurements and 
weight of all the mobile homes in Tall al-Rumaytha. Qrasan was 
also asked to estimate the number of people that can, 
theoretically, occupy each such home (probably to determine the 
number of settlers that can barricade themselves in the homes 
and oppose evacuation). Qrasan has given the Army his answers. 
  The Hebron settlers believe the request indicates that the 
IDF is attempting to prepare a contingency or practical plan for 
the evacuation of the site, where seven families currently 
reside. 
  The curfew on Hebron and its surroundings will be lifted 
today or tomorrow at the latest. The curfew was imposed on the 
city three weeks ago, immediately after the Cave of the 
Patriarchs massacre. The decision to lift the curfew was made 
after a series of discussions in which the participants heard 
reports about the distress of the Palestinian population. At 
the same time, fear was expressed that once life in Hebron 
returns to normal, riots might erupt and clashes between the 
Army, the residents, and the settlers might take place. 
  Before the curfew is lifted, additional IDF and Border 
Police 
troops will be stationed in Hebron. 
  The Tomb of the Patriarchs will not be opened to the public 
at this stage. The IDF is currently working out new procedures 
and security measures for the site, including separate entrances 
for the two nationalities. It has already been decided to 
prohibit bringing arms into the tomb. Security sources believe 
that riots will break out when the curfew is lifted. If the 
riots evolve into serious incidents, the curfew will be 
reimposed. 
  The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and 
Gaza has begun preparing for the possibility of the government's 
ordering the IDF to evacuate the Hebron settlers. The 
settlement leaders have contacted groups in Qiryat Arba' and 
other settlements in a bid to thwart the evacuation. They plan 
to call thousands of people to Hebron once they learn of an 
imminent evacuation. 
  Seven families currently reside in Tall al-Rumaytha: The 
family of Kakh leader Barukh Marzel, who is currently wanted 
after an administrative detention order was issued against him; 
the family of David Shir'el, whose gun was taken from him; the 
Ra'anan family (headed by the grandson of Rabbi Avraham Hakohen 
Kook); the family of Uri Qrasan, the Hebron Jewish settlement 
security officer; the Ben-Yitzhaq family; and the Horowitz 
family [six families named as published]. 
  The rising tension in Hebron and the fear of terror attacks 
have led the General Staff to decide to cancel the training 
schedules of infantry units and deploy them for active duty in 
the territories and Lebanon. For example, a combat unit that 
has just completed a tour of active duty in Lebanon was about to 
begin a series of exercises. By order of Major General Dani 
Yatom, commander of the Central Command, the soldiers were sent 
for active duty in the West Bank. The same has happened with 
other military units. 
  A senior military source said: "Everyone is waiting for the 
big bang. Canceling training schedules is not good, but 
everyone is under pressure. We are expecting an Arab 
retaliation. No one is happy about canceling drills and 
exercises, but this is dictated by the reality in the field."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dan Margalit: "One Government, Two Fronts"] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The time has come to 
extirpate the cancerous tumor from Hebron, the city of our 
patriarchs. Not as a gesture to 'Arafat (which is unnecessary) 
or to tacitly fulfill the yearnings of the United States, but as 
a collective punishment to be meted out by the government -- and 
this time directed against the settlers. 
  Rabin was surprised that many settlers cherish the memory of 
Dr. Barukh Goldstein. Their leaders threaten that there will be 
more such doctors. Peres is ashamed of them? Deputy Education 
Minister Mikha Goldman incurs the wrath of religious teachers 
because he criticizes the assassin. All this deserves 
punishment. 
  Punishment to the rabbi of Qiryat Arba' who issued a 
frightful halakhic edict making the lives of all Palestinians 
fair game, as if the word "innocent" no longer applied to them; 
punishment to Knesset members of the National Religious Party 
who sing the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] praises all year 
round, but this week trampled over its roadblocks on their way 
to Hebron to rally around Rabbi Moshe Levinger; and stiff 
punishment for all those people communing with the mediums, 
psychics, and spirits gathering on moonless nights around 
Goldstein's grave. 
  All of them must know that this government is choking the 
settlements, not to meet the wishes of the Palestinians or the 
Americans, but for the sake of the Jews. So that every settler 
threatening the peace process with "more Goldsteins" should know 
that if he makes good on his threat Qiryat Arba' will also be 
shut down; not as part of a Jewish-Arab settling of scores but 
as a result of purely Jewish introspection and soul searching. 
  Such a move enjoys the support of an overwhelming majority 
in 
Israeli public opinion. It also enjoys a majority by the 
standards of the opposition which has been questioning whether 
the government enjoys an absolute Jewish majority. One may also 
hazard a guess that such a majority also exists among Likud 
voters, who may be willing to fight for Qiryat Arba' but not for 
the provocation embodied in Tall al-Rumaythah. 
  Also, removing the Jews from the heart of Hebron is 
feasible. 
All the government needs is an ultimatum and an evacuation 
order. Those who do not leave Bet Hadassah and Tall al-Rumaythah 
and go back to Qiryat Arba' would be left to fend for themselves 
in Hebron. Of course, they would be solely responsible for the 
consequences. Only the children would be taken away from their 
parents and transferred to a protected site nearby. Once the 
"Bet Hadassah" tumor is gone there will be no "more Goldsteins," 
since Qiryat Arba' will take care to rein them in to spare 
itself the fate of Tall al-Rumaythah.

  [Text] Last night, brother Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], 
president of the state of Palestine, had an emergency telephone 
contact with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 
connection with the aggression carried out by the Israeli Army's 
special units on the southern part of the city of Hebron and the 
destruction of some civilian houses under the pretext of 
searching for some wanted persons. 
  The Israeli attacks on the citizens led to the destruction 
of 
numerous houses and the death and wounding of a number of 
victims as a result of the rocket bombardment by the special 
units without concern for the lives, safety, and possessions of 
the civilians, the blood of whose brothers at the holy 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has not dried up yet. 
  The brother President Abu-'Ammar pointed out that these 
kinds 
of Israeli practices would reflect negatively on the peace 
process and cause concern at this sensitive stage of the 
development of the situation in the Middle East. 
  The brother President Abu-'Ammar asked Secretary Christopher 
for an immediate intervention to put an end to this aggression 
against the secure citizens, who are being besieged as a result 
of the curfew imposed by the Israeli occupation forces since the 
brutal massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.

<F P=106> [Article by Bilal al-Hasan: "The U.S. Likudist Stance"] </F>
  [Text] The Likudist nature of the U.S. position on the 
Palestinian question is now a public phenomenon. It was 
manifest in the refusal to have Jerusalem mentioned as an 
occupied Palestinian city. Likud lost in Israel but it still 
rules supreme in Washington. 
  The Likud Party lost power in Israel but Likud logic still 
prevails in the U.S. political circles. In its approach to the 
Arab-Israeli conflict and especially the Palestinian question, 
the U.S. Administration appears to be more Israeli than the 
Israelis. It is a Likudist approach, putting pressure on the 
ruling Labor Party to rise to the level of its own extremism. 
The latest UN Security Council discussions presented a rare 
opportunity to demonstrate that U.S. (Likudist) position as it 
really is. 
  In the beginning, and despite the Hebron massacre, 
Washington 
was opposed to the issuance of any resolution by the Security 
Council and just called for a statement by the chairman only 
condemning the massacre. It was acting on Israel's behalf. 
When it realized the magnitude of the Palestinian and Arab fury 
as a result of the massacre and the extent of the world's 
sympathy with the victims of the massacre, Washington kindly 
agreed to let the Security Council pass a resolution provided it 
did not condemn Israel. The Council would have had to condemn 
the massacre as an anonymous act by unknown people in an unknown 
place with unknown responsibility and unknown culpability. 
  When the Palestinian side tried to link the massacre to the 
Geneva Convention on occupation and people under occupation, the 
United States opposed that and insisted that there should be no 
mention in the resolution of Jerusalem as an occupied city. It 
objected to that part of the resolution when voting took place. 
  The United States wants to force the world to act on the 
basis that the Oslo agreement supersedes everything that came 
before it, that all the Security Council's resolutions on 
Jerusalem, the massacres, the deportations, and the settlements, 
are now null and void and no longer constitute terms of 
reference for the negotiations, and that the only terms of 
reference are the Oslo agreement and what the negotiators agree 
upon in their meetings. 
  The Likudist character of the U.S. Administration is no 
illusion, nor is it an exaggeration. The Jewish lobby in the 
United States is openly pro-Likud. It had even opposed the Oslo 
agreement. Shim'on Peres, the architect of that agreement, had 
to go to Washington to persuade the Jewish lobby to accept it 
because it was in Israel's interest. Furthermore, the main 
Jewish figures in the U.S. Administration who are responsible 
for the handling of the Palestinian question, are also 
pro-Likud, from Dennis Ross to Martin Indyk. In addition to 
that Likudist line, the U.S. Administration is willing to change 
the Security Council from an international body to a secretariat 
attached to the White House. Voting on the massacre resolution 
was postponed 12 times. The postponements took place after 
phone calls from Warren Christopher to the U.S. representative 
at the Security Council. That representative (not the the 
Council's chairman) then announced these postponements to 
reporters. When asked by reporters: Are you disappointed? She 
replied: I am always disappointed -- having been transformed 
from being the representative of a superpower into a mere 
secretary receiving orders on the telephone. The U.S. position 
on the Security Council and on Jerusalem in particular is a 
dangerous position, very dangerous indeed, and its seriousness 
may even be greater than that of the massacre itself 
necessitating a general Arab awareness and a unified Arab stand 
rising to the level of the issue of Jerusalem and what it means 
to everyone. 
  Dennis Ross was threatening Yasir 'Arafat when he told him 
that discussion of the issue of the settlements and 
international protection would bring down Rabin. In other 
words, it would bring Likud to power. Examined in depth, that 
was not an American threat but rather a U.S. wish and a hint as 
to what could happen in the future as the U.S. Administration 
prepares to implement the Likud designs fully.

[UGTA] in protest against the burning down of enterprises and 
the killing of decent citizens. [passage omitted] 
  Airport workers also responded to the call. Thus, all 
domestic and international flights were suspended. Commercial 
activity was paralyzed at the port of Algiers after workers 
there stopped working for several hours. [passage omitted] 
  According to the UGTA, the rate of participation in the 
nationwide strike is estimated at 87 percent. 
  March 22 will remain an anniversary for the condemnation of 
acts of violence, a symbol of refusal and a rejection of 
disagreements between the children of this wounded homeland.

  [Text] President of the Republic, Lieutenant General 'Umar 
Hasan Hamad al-Bashir, said today that the rejection of the 
Garang faction to form an agreement reached during talks, 
assures that the movement is just a front manipulated by foreign 
elements to serve their ends. He referred to the Israeli arms 
shipment to the rebels which was recently discovered, which 
confirms the imperialist double-dealing played by America to 
delegate one of its allies to play its role. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir 
told the media and press leaderships at his weekly press 
briefing session this afternoon, that the rebel movement had 
lost its credibility as a so-called national movement, as it had 
become a tool for foreign powers. He put foreign interference 
as the major obstacle to peace in Sudan. He affirmed that Sudan 
is still committed to the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought 
and Development [IGADD] initiative. 
  He also praised the accord among the Somali factions [as 
heard], expressing Sudan's continued appeals to solve the 
problem by Somalis, condemning foreign intervention, which had 
escalated the conflict. 
  Although the Sudanese National Salvation Revolution elements 
are clean and honest, yet the attorney general had directed 
immediate action to be taken on any corruption complaint. Lt. 
Gen. al-Bashir warned the rumormongers of the negative impacts 
of their foul deeds.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A German vessel denied entry to al-'Aqabah 
was on its way Wednesday [23 March] to another port in the Red 
Sea to unload part of its cargo to meet the demands of the 
U.S.-led enforcers of the international sanctions against Iraq, 
shipping officials said. 
  The 1300-tonne Skyman, carrying 3,000-tonnes of general 
cargo 
for Jordan, is the second al-'Aqabah-bound vessel to be turned 
away this month and the seventh to be intercepted and delayed 
this year, said Sufyan Muhaysin, manager of the Jordan Shipping 
Agents Association. 
  The Red Sea Energy, operated by a consortium of British, 
German and French companies, was turned away last week after the 
inspectors found two 20-feet containers carrying zinc 
phosphorate for Iraq. 
  The inspectors' decision came despite documents attending 
U.N. Sanctions Committee approval for the consignment of the 
chemical, used in the detergent industry, shipping sources said. 
  As a rule, anything classified as "chemicals" comes under 
close scrutiny of the inspectors. In many cases, entry to 
al-'Aqabah is categorically denied. 
  The interceptions came against intensified moves by the 
government to alleviate the negative impact of the sanctions 
enforcement on Jordan's economy and a call by Parliament for the 
Kingdom to refuse to return to the American backed Arab-Israeli 
peace talks until the "siege of al-'Aqabah" is lifted. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told reporters after 
talks with U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross late 
Tuesday that Mr. Ross had promised to consider Jordan's 
grievances over the continuing blockade, which is severely 
hampering the Kingdom's maritime operations and trade. 
  The stepped-up interceptions of ships entering the Gulf of 
Aqaba come amid follow-up efforts to a proposal to move the 
inspection of cargo to the port from the Iran Straits where it 
is taking place new. 
  The proposal was expected to have been discussed by Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and Dr. al-'Anani during their 
meeting with Mr. Ross. 
  Under the proposal, an independent international agency, 
most 
probably Lloyd Register of London, will inspect all incoming and 
outgoing cargo at the port for violations of the international 
sanctions against Iraq instead of the multinational naval task 
force led by American warships now patrolling the Red Sea. 
  Contacts are continuing among Jordanian, American and U.N. 
officials as well as representatives of Lloyd Register on 
various aspects of the proposed arrangement, sources said. 
However, no one could provide any definite information as to 
the progress achieved. 
  Independent land-based inspections by an international 
agency, from the Jordanian viewpoint, will remove all hurdles 
that ship owners cite to justify higher freight charges to and 
from al-'Aqabah to buffet extra costs incurred as a result of 
the delays caused by inspections at sea. 
  At present, Jordanian importers pay $500 per 20-feet 
container and $1,000 per 40-feet container over and above the 
regular freight charges to al-'Aqabah. The surcharge for 
non-containerised cargo is around $15 per tonne. 
  In addition are extra costs paid by importers to bring their 
cargo to al-'Aqabah if the original ships carrying them are 
forced to off load them at other Red Sea ports. 
  "Cargo inaccessibility," one of the main reasons cited by 
the 
inspectors for turning ships away from al-'Aqabah, was also the 
reason for the Skyman being denied entry to al-'Aqabah despite 
efforts by the crew of the ship to rearrange cargo for 
inspection. 
  Ibrahim Nauri, an official of the agents of the vessel, said 
inspectors boarded the Skyman four times between Saturday and 
Tuesday before refusing it permission to proceed to al-'Aqabah. 
  Mr. Muhaysin said the Skyman and the Red Sea Energy were the 
third and fourth ships to be turned away from al-'Aqabah since 
the beginning of the year, the two others came back after 
unloading or rearranging cargo for inspection. The crew of 
three other vessels managed to rearrange cargo while at sea to 
satisfy the inspectors' demands, he said. 
  According to U.S. Navy figures, the naval task force, which 
is now supported by four American warships, has queried 19,800 
ships over radio, boarded more than 8000 for closer checks, and 
turned away 450 since it took up station following the 
imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opposition Confirms Deterioration of </F>
Security Situation in Baghdad"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The "Iraqi Dispatch Committee" 
belonging to the Unified Iraqi National Congress in Salah al-Din 
(Iraqi Kurdistan) has said that the security situation in 
Baghdad has deteriorated "dramatically." 
  A report from the committee, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has 
received, says that Iraqi authorities have confirmed this 
deterioration. The government-controlled newspaper 
AL-JUMHURIYAH published on 19 March a statement issued by the 
Interior Ministry, saying that death sentences had been passed 
against four people -- three are in prison and the fourth is at 
large -- for stealing a car and involvement in an armed clash 
with the traffic police in Baghdad. The ministry announced a 
reward of 1 million dinars ($3,152) for the fugitive's arrest. 
  The Dispatch Committee listed in its report several 
incidents 
which occurred in Baghdad during February and March: the theft 
of a car belonging to the British relief organization Oxfam (11 
March), an explosion near the Air Force Command premises (13 
March), another explosion near a statue of President Saddam 
Husayn in al-Zawra' park (2 March), a bomb explosion in Tunis 
Street (27 February), and a clash which occurred at night in 14 
Ramadan Street between an armed group and a police patrol. This 
clash resulted in the killing of an officer and a policeman (28 
February).

  [Text] Paris, 23 Mar (MENA)--Libya has announced that it 
agrees to hand over two of its citizens suspected in the 
Lockerbie downing for trial at the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague with the participation of judges from 
Scotland. 
  This was announced by Sa'd Mujbir, secretary of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee at the General People's Congress in Libya, in 
a speech he delivered at the meeting of the International 
Parliamentary Union currently being held in Paris. 
  Sa'd Mujbir said that "to you and through you, we declare to 
the whole world that we officially accept the proposal by Mr. 
Black, professor of law in Scotland, for the Libyans to be tried 
before the International Court of Justice in The Hague with the 
participation of judges from Scotland". 
  It is worth noting that Colonel al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the 
Libyan revolution, has previously agreed for the two Libyans to 
be tried at the International Court of Justice without 
mentioning Scottish participation, but this was rejected every 
time by the United States and Britain.

  [Excerpt] Presidential Council Chairman Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has met with the brothers members of the 
expanded conference of the Ma'rib Governorate masses. This 
brought together shaykhs, notables, social figures, clergymen, 
merchants, and representatives of parties, political 
organizations, and popular associations [words indistinct]. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman spoke to them. He 
welcomed them and exchanged with them congratulations on the 
advent of the blessed 'Id al-Fitr. He expressed his immense 
appreciation of the militant positions and the high national 
sense of responsibility demonstrated by the Ma'rib Governorate 
residents. He also appreciated their keenness to stick to 
national constants, foremost among which are the revolution, 
unity, and democracy. He also praised the militant roles played 
by the Ma'rib Governorate population in defense of the march of 
the revolution and the Republic. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman added: Ma'rib is 
the epitome of history, civilization, loyalty, and glories. I 
have always been with you in all circumstances and conditions. 
I have listened to your grievances. I am aware of the 
sufferings caused for the Ma'rib Governorate, particularly since 
it was isolated and deprived of its right to development. Since 
1981, the governorate has seen a tangible development effort. 
Much has been done in Ma'rib, thanks to the cooperation of its 
population. We have great hopes that we will be able to 
implement further service and development projects to promote 
the quality of life in Ma'rib. 
  During his meeting with the population of the Ma'rib 
Governorate, the brother Presidential Council chairman reviewed 
current national developments, the background and implications 
of the current political crisis, the factors affecting its 
course, and its impact on the country and national unity, as 
well as the harm it has caused the homeland and citizens, who 
are currently overburdened by the continued crisis, which should 
not have reached this state of affairs in the first place. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman noted that our 
people regained their unity on 22 May 1990, when the Yemeni 
community was reunified, [words indistinct] potentials and 
capabilities so that the development endeavor may be promoted, 
and so the homeland may see progress. He said efforts have 
continued to be made to cope with the current crisis. He 
stressed the need for Constitutional institutions to convene 
their meetings so together they may shoulder their 
responsibilities toward the implementation of the accord 
document, and in order to promote trust and safeguard the march 
of unity and democracy in our country. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman asserted that 
there 
is no way for the separatist past to be recreated, and that 
there is no going back on unity, regardless of the price 
entailed, because unity is the ideal of all Yemenis' pride and 
dignity. It is the present and future of the homeland. 
  The brother president warned against all forms of division 
within the society. He added: We must confront all feeble 
souls who cause differences, conflicts, and parochial disputes, 
be they regional, sectarian, tribal, or otherwise. For our 
people are an Arab and Muslim people. They have a common creed, 
common principles, and common objectives. They strongly adhere 
to their Islamic creed and their national constants. We must 
unify our ranks, and positions. Our top priority must be to 
spare our homeland sedition and conflicts, and to promote its 
quest for construction, development, unity, and democracy so 
that it may reach safe shores. 
  The brother president commended the decisions and 
recommendations made by the expanded conference of the Ma'rib 
Governorate masses. He blessed these decisions, which reflected 
a high sense of national responsibility aimed at sparing the 
homeland division and rifts and safeguarding its unity. 
Besides, these decisions reflected the patriotic sentiments and 
truthful intent of the Ma'rib Governorate, which are best seen 
in hard circumstances and critical junctures in the homeland's 
history. He reiterated that democracy will continue to 
safeguard and fortify unity, and that differences, regardless of 
how serious they are, must be resolved through peaceful and 
democratic dialogue. He indicated that the Yemenis have 
embraced democracy, and that they must shoulder the consequences 
of democracy, regardless of what they may be. For democracy and 
pluralism have caused us to acknowledge and accept the peaceful 
exchange of authority. It is we who announced that the Yemeni 
president must not be allowed to rule for more than two 
presidential terms in office so that a new leadership may be 
allowed to take over, and to expand the base of power-sharing. 
The homeland provides ample room for all. Besides, it is the 
property of all Yemenis, the brother president said. 
  The brother president added: The past, which is marked by 
separation, provides us with an abundance of lessons, from which 
we must learn. We must do everything that can serve our 
homeland and promote its higher interests. We must spare no 
effort to build the homeland and achieve renaissance and 
development in it. We will do our best to achieve this, in 
cooperation with all well-meaning parties in the homeland.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Council of Ministers following an </F>
emergency session in B'abda Palace on 23 March; read by 
Information Minister Michel Samahah--live or recorded] 
  [Text] Lebanon has emerged from the painful war and its 
various effects and covered a long distance along the road 
toward reviving its society with its democratic institutions, 
its administrative and security apparatuses, its production 
sectors, and its infrastructure. Lebanon determinedly and 
courageously shoulders the responsibility of resisting and 
standing fast against the unrestrained Israeli aggression 
against its land and people. And Lebanon was preparing for 
national and regional developments, relying in this on its 
national harmony and full coordination with its Arab brothers, 
when a scheme feeding off the Israeli source emerged in the 
homeland to target the country's unity, freedom, and immunity. 
Some of those offended by the restoration of social peace did 
not hesitate to get involved in that scheme to realize the 
enemy's objectives as well as the suspicious ends that started 
to appear in the form of calls for self-enforced security and 
for reviewing the state's unity. 
  What happened at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq 
Mikha'il 
and before that along the al-Balamant road and the central 
headquarters of the Lebanese Phalangist Party, in addition to 
the explosive charges that were placed in cultural and 
educational centers, the assaults on men of religion and 
religious places, the desecration of graves, the printing and 
publishing of leaflets that instigate sectarian strife, and the 
spreading of rumors that incite, all constitute irrefutable 
evidence that the most sacred foundations of Lebanon's existence 
are being targeted. 
  Against all this, the Council of Ministers would like to 
affirm the following: 
  1. Lebanon will not take a bystander's position on these 
developments. Since the criminal intentions were uncovered and 
the terrorist operations emerged, Lebanon has been determined to 
abort attempts that target its stability and seek to harm its 
peace and reconstruction march; 
  2. The Council of Ministers highly appreciates the efforts 
and sacrifices made by the security forces, including the Army 
and the internal, public, and state security forces. These 
efforts have led to uncovering the dimensions of the conspiracy, 
exposing its planners, and arresting its perpetrators. The 
Council reaffirms its earlier decisions to entrust the Lebanese 
Army with the task of deploying over all the Lebanese 
territories to protect the homeland's unity, the sovereignty of 
the law, and the society's safety; 
  3. The Council of Ministers has adopted a set of measures to 
protect the country, maintain its domestic security, and deter 
the conspirators regardless of their affiliations. It will not 
tolerate the view of self-enforced security or the establishment 
of individual security cantons anywhere in Lebanon; 
  4. The Council of Ministers calls on the mass media to deal 
with things responsibly and to continue to contribute to the 
peace march within the framework of the laws that will be 
referred to the esteemed Chamber of Deputies to organize 
audiovisual media and protect public freedoms; 
  5. The Council of Ministers turns to the international 
community and the sponsors of the peace conference to draw their 
attention to the seriousness of the terrorist actions Israel is 
undertaking against the unity of our homeland and the safety of 
our people in an attempt to strike at Lebanon's peace and 
regional peace chances at the same time. 
  The Cabinet confirms that Lebanon, which regained the unity 
of its institutions and impregnability, and, which valiantly 
resisted the Israeli aggression, will allow no one to strike at 
its achievements. The state, which is committed to the 
constitutional principles and institutions and to the democratic 
parliamentary system, will continue to relentlessly safeguard 
and defend everyone's security, freedoms, and rights. 
  Accordingly, the Cabinet has issued a group of resolutions 
led by Decree No. 4908. President of the Republic, in 
accordance with the Constitution and the Associations Law issued 
on 3 August 1909 and its amendments, particularly Article III, 
and in accordance with (?Notification) No. 178AD dated 10 
September 1991 granted on establishing the association called 
the Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut, and in accordance with the 
Interior Minister's proposal and following the approval of the 
Council of Ministers on 23 March 1994, the following is decreed: 
  Article I: Notification No. 178AD dated 10 September 1991 
issued for the establishment of the association called the 
Lebanese Forces Party in Beirut is withdrawn. The association 
is hereby dissolved. 
  Article II: This decree shall be published, conveyed when 
necessary, and will go into force when issued. 
  The Cabinet has also adopted a group of measures. Article II 
of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 August 1991 defined the crimes 
covered by the Amnesty Law. These include some crimes committed 
against the state's internal security, political crimes, or 
so-called general or local political crimes. They also include 
some crimes stipulated in the Military Penal Law, crimes of 
possessing and carrying any kind of weapon, and crimes of 
abduction and confiscation of freedom. The legislator aimed at 
that time to lay to rest a tragic past that almost wrecked the 
country and its system. But the legislator cautioned that the 
criminals who benefited from the amnesty should not return to 
their habits and should not commit crimes such as those that 
were included in the amnesty. 
  So the last paragraph of Article II of the law has 
stipulated 
the following: 
  Crimes of an excessive and repeated nature or crimes 
perpetrated after this law is issued [words indistinct]. 
  Article 317 of the Penal Law stipulates that every action, 
piece of writing, or speech that aims to incite religious or 
racist discords or to instigate disputes among the various sects 
and among the nation's members should be punished. 
  Since the country, after 28 March 1991 [as heard], and 
especially very recently, has been the scene of more crimes 
against the state's internal security--crimes formerly covered 
by the general amnesty--or crimes of a similar nature including 
car bombings, bombings of worshippers, the placing of explosive 
devices in densely populated areas, including schools, and acts 
seeking to undermine the state's public order and security, 
weaken national unity, harm the country's basic interests, and 
provoke sedition; 
  Since some audio and visual media continue to go to extreme 
lengths to broadcast news and commentaries likely to provoke 
sectarian fanaticisms; 
  Since the Weapons and Ammunition Law issued on 12 June 1959 
specified a maximum three-year prison sentence for the 
unlicensed possession and transport of military weapons; 
  And since this penalty is not considered a sufficient 
deterrent in the current circumstances and conditions, 
  The Cabinet has decided the following: 
  First, the justice minister is requested to draw the 
attention of the concerned judicial authorities to the 
aforementioned legal penalties, particularly the last paragraph 
of Article II of the Amnesty Law issued on 26 March 1991 [as 
heard] and the second paragraph of Article IV of the same law, 
and to instruct these authorities when necessary to resume the 
prosecution of crimes that are no longer covered by the amnesty 
and those crimes that were perpetrated after 26 March 1991 [as 
heard]--the crimes that caused the forfeiture of the said 
amnesty. 
  Second, as of midnight on 23 March, all visual and audio 
media, except Tele-Liban and Lebanese radio [Beirut Radio 
Lebanon], are banned from broadcasting news and programs that 
are directly or indirectly political until the Audiovisual Media 
Law is passed and goes into force. 
  Tuesday 29 March 1994 has been set as a date for an 
extraordinary Cabinet session to make a final decision on the 
Audiovisual Media Bill. 
  Any media station that does not abide by this decision will 
be prevented from further broadcasting and immediately closed. 
  The Internal Security Forces, assisted by the Army, are 
instructed to implement this decision against violators. 
  Third, the justice minister, the minister of national 
defense, and other concerned ministers are requested to submit 
the necessary bills to enact stiffer penalties on the 
aforementioned crimes to the point where they become a real 
deterrent. This will be done to deter those who wish to exploit 
the country's atmosphere of liberty. 
  The information minister conveyed to the Cabinet a 
recommendation by the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Committee 
during its discussion of a bill increasing the capital of the 
Tele-Liban Company. The recommendation urges the state to own 
all the shares of this company. The prime minister, who is the 
proprietor of the private sector's share in this company, showed 
responsiveness to this recommendation. The Cabinet consequently 
decided that the state should buy the private sector's share in 
this company and instructed the information and finance 
ministers to carry out the necessary legal measures for this 
purpose.

<F P=106> [By Hala Boncompagni] </F>
  [Text] Beirut, March 24 (AFP) -- A government ban on a 
Christian party and private news programs was seen here Thursday 
[24 March] as an unofficial declaration of a state of emergency. 
  Information Minister Michel Samahah, who announced the 
measures at the end of a five-hour cabinet meeting on Wednesday, 
accused Israel of colluding with Lebanese parties in a bid to 
destabilise Lebanon. 
  The government charged that Israel was carrying out 
"terrorist activities in a bid to harm unity and peace in 
Lebanon, and the chances of peace in the region." 
  Samahah said that the media ban would take effect from 
midnight Wednesday until the government can come up with a law 
to regulate the media in Lebanon. 
  The cabinet would meet next Tuesday to discuss the 
legislation, he said. 
  But until then news coverage would be strictly limited to 
state-run Radio Liban [Beirut Radio Lebanon] and Tele Liban. 
Radio and television stations that violate the ban will be shut 
down, Samahah said. 
  The unprecedented moves came after Lebanese police arrested 
on Wednesday Fu'ad Malik, the second-in-command of the Lebanese 
Forces (LF), a militia disbanded at the end of the 1975-1990 war 
which had become a political party. 
  Malik was taken into custody in connection with the bombing 
of a church last month in which 10 worshippers were killed. The 
judge investigating the attack identified seven other suspects 
as members of the LF. 
  The measures amount to "an unofficial declaration of a state 
of emergency in the country," a government official told the 
independent Arabic-language newspaper AL-NAHAR. 
  "It's a counter-coup to the coup which would have taken 
place 
if plans for destabilisation had been successful," he added. 
  "Good for them. The Lebanese Forces made us cower in 
shelters for 20 years while they destroyed the country," a taxi 
driver said about the former militia's involvement in the 
Lebanese war. 
  He also applauded the decision to ban private news program 
saying: "We've been poisoned by too many news bulletins each 
day, too many radios giving their opinion. It's just as well." 
  But opposition MP Najah Wakim warned that he will try to 
fight the government's media ban, stressing that it was an 
infringement on political freedoms. 
  "The right to broadcast news should not be confined to the 
state run media only. Every radio and television has the right 
to broadcast news," he said. 
  The Lebanese press hailed the measures while Lebanon's 20 
radio and television stations -- except for the pro-Israeli 
Voice of the South -- complied with the ban, which also covered 
political talk shows. 
  LF radio, Voice of Free Lebanon [(Clandestine) Radio Free 
Lebanon], and their television, Lebanese Broadcasting 
Corporation, broadcast music instead of its scheduled news 
bulletins. 
  Sawt al-Sha'b [(Clandestine) Voice of the People], run by 
the 
Communist party, issued a statement saying it would abide by the 
ban but urged the authorities to take immediate steps to issue a 
law regulating the media in Lebanon. 
  Authorities earlier this month lashed out against private 
stations for leaking findings of the investigation into the 
bombing of Our Lady of Deliverance church north of Beirut. 
  They charged that some private media, which flourished 
during 
the country's civil war, were spreading rumors that it said 
could fan disputes between the country's Moslem and Christian 
communities.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says it is still not 
clear whether he will meet Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo tomorrow. 
This evening Mr. Peres met Dennis Ross, the head of the U.S. 
peace team, and U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian. Prior to 
entering the meeting Mr. Peres said the discussions by the 
Israeli delegation in Cairo are serious, but we should not jump 
to conclusions. 
  Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that Deputy Foreign 
Minister Yosi Beilin, who also participated in the meeting this 
evening, said that the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from 
Hebron is not on the agenda at the present time. Beilin hoped 
that the talks with the Palestinians would resume next week.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Syrian `Veto' on PLO Torpedoes Cordon </F>
States Meetings"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Highly placed Jordanian 
sources have stated that the formula governing the meetings of 
the Arab cordon states, namely Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, 
and the PLO, probably no longer exists and no coordination 
meetings are expected to be held in the near future. 
  The sources added that Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' 
had stated frankly at Amman airport on his latest visit that the 
PLO had ruled itself out of all coordination frameworks when it 
signed the Oslo agreement in Washington last September. 
  The sources expected the five-party cordon states formula to 
be replaced by coordination meetings between Jordan, Syria, and 
Lebanon. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, who has resigned from the PLO 
Executive 
Committee, also ruled out the possibility of a cordon states 
meeting in the near future. In an interview with AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT he said that "such meetings came to a halt when the PLO 
leadership solitarily signed the Oslo agreement, which made 
Damascus emphatically object to the PLO's presence at 
coordination meetings. [no closing quotation mark] 
  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political Department, tried 
unsuccessfully to soften the Syrian position and to call for a 
coordination meeting attended by the five parties. The valid 
formula now is one of consultation between the three parties. 
That was clear when President Hafiz al-Asad, in his 
conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton after the Security 
Council passed its resolution 904, said that Syria, Jordan, and 
Lebanon had agreed to resume the negotiations with Israel. 
  Political observers in Amman point out that Cairo is no 
longer very enthusiastic for a coordination meeting of the 
cordon states and that at present it gives priority to the 
implementation of the PLO-Israel Cairo agreement, over which 
Cairo had a diplomatic clash with Washington when President 
Clington called for the transfer of the venue of the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to Washington. That 
disagreement was resolved on the basis that the final agreement 
between the two sides would be signed in Cairo.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League General 
Secretariat has urged the international community and the two 
sponsors of the peace process--Russia and the United States--to 
immediately and urgently adopt the necessary measures that would 
guarantee Israel's respect of international legitimacy's 
resolutions. 
  The Arab League also called on the Security Council to 
provide as soon as possible the mechanism necessary to protect 
the Palestinian people against the atrocities carried out by the 
Israeli occupation forces. 
  In a statement issued today, the Arab League General 
Secretariat says that in the past it had warned of acts of 
violence against the Palestinian citizens in the occupied lands. 
In its statement, the Arab League says: At a time when the 
world is waiting for the implementation of Security Council 
Resolution 904 concerning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the 
Israeli occupation authorities have carried out an 18-hour siege 
of a three-story building in Hebron. The Israeli forces opened 
artillery fire on Palestinian citizens, killing a number of 
them, including two women, one of them pregnant. 
  The statement affirms that Israel has once again proved its 
disregard of international resolutions and the appeals of 
international society. 
  The Arab League said that Israel is endeavoring to torpedo 
the peace process despite its claims on the issue of peace. 
This might undermine the Arab public's confidence in the 
on-going efforts, in view of the clear contradiction between the 
call for peace and the efforts to achieve it.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received Victor Pasuvalyuk, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special emissary, who is 
visiting Cairo. The talks dealt with the latest developments in 
the Arab arena and the developments in the Middle East peace 
process. 
  Afterward, the Russian official stated that he and the Arab 
League secretary general discussed the peace process and the 
direct practical steps that must be taken to advance the peace 
process. They also discussed the situation in Iraq and the 
Libyan-Western crisis. 
  Pasuvalyuk said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed an increase 
in the Russian role in the area, considering that Russia is a 
big power, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a 
cosponsor of the peace process, and has interests and friends in 
the Middle East. 
  The Russian envoy said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained that 
the Russian role in the Middle East need not necessarily repeat 
or compete with the role of any other party. But it should be a 
constructive role working for the benefit of peace and stability 
in the region. 
  The Russian official affirmed that his country wants to 
confer with all the parties concerned to achieve stability in 
the Middle East. He also affirmed that Russia wants to resume 
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. 
  He said that Moscow has made enormous efforts to convince 
all 
the parties of the need to resume the peace process despite the 
difficulties facing it after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in 
Hebron.

<F P=106> [Report by Husayn 'Abd-al-Ghani in Muscat and Salamah Ni'mat </F>
in Amman] 
  [Text] King Husayn Bin-Talal began a several-day private 
visit to the Sultanate of Oman for talks with Sultan Qabus 
Bin-Sa'id about regional and Arab issues. 
  Informed sources speaking with AL-HAYAH thought it likely 
that the two monarchs, who have strong personal ties and conduct 
regular talks, would confine their discussions to the political 
crisis in Yemen. They have taken a mediating role and 
responsibility for the signing of the pledge and accord 
agreement, which lost no time in breaking down. 
  These sources indicated their belief that the visit of the 
Jordanian monarch and his talks in Salalah (Sultan Qabus' 
southern summer capital, about 1,000 km from Muscat) are what 
will decide whether the two sides will proceed in their joint 
mediation or whether they will give the opportunity to other 
Arab parties that have entered the crisis recently, especially 
President Husni Mubarak, who announced day before yesterday that 
he is trying to arrange a peace settlement in Cairo between the 
chairman of the Yemeni Presidential Council, Lieutenant General 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, and the deputy chairman of the 
Presidential Council, 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  These sources said that Oman, which borders Yemen, feels 
uneasy at the continuation of the Yemeni crisis and the threat 
that it represents to the stability of the the Arabian Peninsula 
and the Gulf. [They added that] it and Jordan have sent a joint 
military committee composed of officers from the two countries 
to prevent the outbreak of war between north and south Yemen. 
  The issue that has given these sources the impression that 
the two countries are studying the next step in their joint 
effort to solve the Yemeni crisis is the fact that a joint visit 
announced in Amman that the Jordanian and Omani foreign 
ministers were to take to Yemen before the 'Id al-Fitr [13 
March] did not take place. 
  King Husayn will also present to his host the permanent 
topic 
in their discussions since the second Gulf crisis--that of 
Gulf-Jordanian relations, which have severely deteriorated since 
that time. The Jordanian monarch will go on to Qatar after his 
visit to the Sultanate in an official visit that is his first to 
a Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] country (other than Oman) since 
the summer of 1990. 
  Observers in Muscat told AL-HAYAH that the visit to Qatar 
opens a new window for Jordan in the GCC, but does not 
necessarily mean that normalization with the rest of the GCC 
states has become imminent. 
  In Amman, Jordanian political sources yesterday opined that 
King Husayn's visit to the Sultanate of Oman within the 
framework of his tour to the state of Qatar is a Jordanian move 
aimed at exiting from the Arab isolation that has been imposed 
on it by the Gulf crisis and war and at apprising most of the 
Arab leaders of the likely collapse of the peace process in the 
region. 
  An informed political authority said that Jordan believes 
that the isolation it is still suffering more than three years 
after the Gulf crisis and war is part of the pressure being put 
on it within the framework of the peace process. A senior 
Jordanian official indicated that the United States stands 
behind the political and economic pressure that the Kingdom 
faces and the continuation of the Arab boycott of it. He pointed 
out that the continuation of the naval blockade of the Jordanian 
port of al-'Aqabah and the escalation of the International 
Monetary Fund's pressure with regard to foreign debt servicing 
have a direct relationship with Jordan's resistance to being 
pushed in the direction of a quick settlement with Israel 
without waiting for the achievement of noticeable progress on 
the other negotiation paths. 
The political authority says that King Husayn will inform the 
Omani and Qatari leaders of his concept of the results of the 
peace settlement between Israel and the PLO, and of its 
reflections on Jordan and intra-Arab relations. The Jordanian 
monarch made telephone calls to the leaders of Syria, Egypt, 
Morocco, and the PLO immediately after the Security Council 
issued its resolution on the Mosque of Ibrahim massacre, and the 
abstention of the United States from voting on the part of the 
resolution that considers eastern Jerusalem part of the Arab 
occupied territories, as mentioned by Security Council 
Resolution 242 of 1967.

  [Text] The infamous militia of Golboddin-Dostam last night 
mounted a failed offensive on the positions of the Islamic 
army's forces in the easterly direction. A security source told 
the BAKHTAR INFORMATION AGENCY [BIA] military correspondent that 
the offensive of the militia was aborted in the very first hours 
of the attack, and damage was inflicted on rebellious militia, 
which suffered a great loss of life. Following their defeat 
last night, the militia subjected residential areas of city of 
Kabul to rocket attacks last night and this morning. It caused 
no loss of life, but some damage was inflicted on the residents 
of Kabul. According to another report, yesterday afternoon a 
heavy clash took place between the militias of Golboddin and 
Dostam in the area of Brishnakot in Kabul. The conflagration 
continued until 2200 last night, and much loss of life was 
suffered by the warring militias. The security source added 
differences between the commanders of Golboddin's party and 
commanders of Dostam were increasing. Since the start of the 
unholy alliance between Golboddin and Dostam, this was the 
umpteenth clash between these two militia groups.

  [Text] Jeddah--Afghan presidency sources have reported that 
government forces day before yesterday entered the heart of 
Pol-e Khomri, the capital of Baghlan Province, while the front 
line of the fighting is centered in the vicinity of the grain 
silos in the southern part of the city, called "little Moscow" 
in the Communist era. Groups of the Ismaili and Uzbek militias, 
and other Communist opposition groups, are concentrated there 
now. 
  In a telephone contact with AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, the Afghan 
sources made little of the attacks that the Uzbek militias, 
under the command of General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, are launching 
against the capital, Kabul, and described them as "desparate." 
They indicated that the government forces had three days ago 
taken large amounts of booty in the form of weapons, ammunition, 
and tremendous quantities of fuel and provisions. They said that 
the Communist militias had been preparing their men and large 
quantities of arms, ammunition, and supplies for an attack on 
northern Kabul from the Pol-e Khomri region. They described the 
amount of booty which the government forces had captured as 
"inconceivable, praise God."

  [Text] Pakistan was compelled to withdraw its resolution on 
Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission -- a very unexpected 
incident. The withdrawal clearly showed that the process of 
forging a new political alliance in the region has begun. As 
little as 12 hours before the withdrawal, international news 
agencies did not give any hint that the resolution would be 
taken back. Rather, the news agencies reported that the Kashmir 
resolution might be passed. In the resolution, Pakistan 
condemned human rights violations in Kashmir and called for 
sending a UN Human Rights Commission fact-finding mission to the 
state. Pakistan considered this resolution very important. 
Prime Minister Bhutto sought the support of each of the member 
countries, but she failed even to win the support of the Muslim 
countries. Pakistan was asked by China and 10 Muslim countries 
-- including Iran -- to withdraw the resolution. Pakistani 
Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali said it was very difficult for 
his country to refuse a request made by China and Iran. Only 
Saudi Arabia and Bosnia-Herzegovina supported Pakistan's 
resolution. Bangladesh remained aloof, saying it would abstain 
from voting on the resolution. It did not side with the 10 
Muslim countries led by Iran or with Pakistan. It should be 
mentioned that neither Saudi Arabia nor Bosnia have any voting 
rights in the 52-member UN Human Rights Commission, but they 
have a large number of supporters. 
  Bangladesh's stand on this issue is not transparent. For a 
long time, Bangladesh has been raising its voice against human 
rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. It has always supported 
UN resolutions on Kashmir, but it did not support this 
Pakistani-sponsored resolution. 
  Diplomatic sources told this correspondent that Bangladesh 
does not have any strategy of its own. Its foreign policy has 
no specific goals. It is difficult to say whether there is any 
logic behind the nonaligned foreign policy currently being 
pursued by Bangladesh following the end of the Cold War between 
the United States and the former Soviet Union. It should be 
mentioned that Bangladesh does not want to support either India 
or Pakistan on this issue. India has described Pakistan's 
resolution as interference in its internal affairs. The 
resolution proposed that a delegation from the International Red 
Cross Society or any reliable representative of the UN Human 
Rights Commission be sent to Kashmir. Before the withdrawal of 
the resolution, India allowed a group of diplomats from Muslim 
countries to visit Kashmir, and officials briefed them on the 
situation in the state. During the visit, the Kashmiri people 
observed a strike and held protest demonstrations. The diplomats 
observed these events from bulletproof cars. 
  Foreign diplomats based in Dhaka have said that this the 
visit India arranged for the Muslim envoys was aimed at 
countering Pakistan's diplomacy on Kashmir. India achieved 
tremendous success in this regard, as the 10 Muslim countries 
led by Iran agreed to ask Pakistan to withdraw its resolution. 
Thus, India was able to win a diplomatic victory over Pakistan. 
This was possible because of the Muslim countries. It must be 
concluded that India has strong ties with the Muslim countries. 
  It may be recalled that when Indian Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao visited Iran toward the end of 1993, Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani proposed that China, India, and Iran form an 
alliance. India did not reject this proposal, and China did not 
voice any opposition to it. 
  Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali gave an interview 
to THE TELEGRAPH during his visit to Bangladesh in which he said 
it is impossible for India or China to form such an alliance. 
He said that Iran made this proposal because of its 
anti-American stand. 
  The undeclared alliance among these three countries became 
clear with the withdrawal of the Pakistani-sponsored resolution 
on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. China's policy is 
that other countries should not have any say regarding the human 
rights situation in this region. The current Iranian policy is 
anti-American, while Indian policy is to overcome the present 
crisis by any means. India does not support Western 
interference in the country's human rights situation. It is 
therefore quite likely that these three countries may forge an 
alliance at any time. If this is done, the alliance will be 
very strong. In the near future, this alliance will also be 
able to influence Pakistani policy. China not only wants to 
compete with the United States by forming an Asia-Pacific 
Economic Council, it also wants to form a regional bloc. After 
pulling out of Vietnam and Cambodia, China tried to establish 
ties with the ASEAN countries. In view of its strained 
relations with ASEAN, China is now in search of new allies. For 
this reason, China is saying that the small countries in the 
region should form an independent bloc. It is not clear what 
stand small countries such as Bangladesh will take toward the 
new bloc China is considering proposing. 
  The nonaligned policy is gradually losing significance. A 
meeting of the nonaligned G-15 group scheduled for New Delhi 
last December was not held. The South American member countries 
did not attend the meeting. These countries -- including Chile, 
Brazil, and Argentina -- are eager to join the North American 
Free Trade Association [as published]. The other members of 
this nonaligned group -- including Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
Zimbabwe -- emphasize the importance of this grouping because 
they have anti-American stands. The pro-American members are 
unhappy about this. 
  Under the prevailing circumstances, the countries of this 
region feel it is necessary to form an alliance. Pakistan's 
resolution on Kashmir led to a diplomatic debacle for that 
country. China believes that Pakistan's resolution had the 
backing of the United States. Beijing is not willing to 
tolerate U.S. interference in the region. It is not clear what 
sort of understanding China would like between India and 
Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. If China wants regional problems 
to be resolved on a regional basis, then we have nothing to say. 
If it wants to achieve its own objectives, however, the small 
countries should consider the matter. We have seen that India 
is unwilling to resolve problems bilaterally. Hence, any 
alliance between India and China would be a cause of concern for 
the small countries.

  [Text] India has opposed Washington's move for amendment or 
one-time waiver of the Pressler legislation banning military 
supplies to Pakistan. 
  The foreign secretary, Mr. K. Srinivasan, told the visiting 
U.S. assistant secretary of state, Ms. Robin Raphel, in New 
Delhi today that any addition to Pakistan's offensive military 
capabilities will escalate tension in the region and seriously 
affect India's security environment. The foreign secretary also 
voiced reservations on the U.S. proposal to discuss the nuclear 
nonproliferation issue within a small group of countries. 
  On India's relations with Pakistan, Mr. Srinivasan 
reaffirmed 
New Delhi's willingness to resume foreign secretary-level talks 
with Islamabad under the Simla Agreement. He hoped Pakistan 
will end its support to transborder terrorism. He drew her 
attention to the Indian parliament resolution on Kashmir and 
asserted that Pakistan's efforts to internationalize the issue 
will not succeed in fulfilling its territorial ambitions. 
  The American official expressed the hope that the prime 
minister would find it convenient to pay a visit to Washington 
at President Clinton's invitation. Mr. Raphel also called on 
the minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia. 
The minister outlined India's preference for a global, 
comprehensive, and nondiscriminatory approach to nuclear 
nonproliferation. 
  Referring to India's relations with the United States, he 
said development of still friendlier bilateral ties is a major 
priority in New Delhi's foreign policy. She also called on the 
commerce secretary.

that the primary objective of her visit to India was to clear up 
misunderstandings which had been created and shared the goal of 
improving Indo-US relations as expressed in home minister's

  3. The discussions were held in a frank and friendly 
atmosphere and were candid, practical, constructive, and 
fruitful. Issues of concern to both sides, including external 
support to terrorism in Punjab and J and K [Jammu and Kashmir], 
came up during the discussions. The home minister highlighted 
the fact that certain statements emanating from Washington 
impacted adversely on the ground situation in J and K. The US 
assistant secretary of state conveyed her government's 
appreciation for India's transparency in J and K and its 
permission to international human rights organisations and 
diplomats to visit Jammu and Kashmir. The assistant secretary 
stressed that United States would continue to urge Pakistan to 
cease aiding and abetting terrorism operating in India. Home 
minister stressed that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of 
India and that the people of India would not tolerate attempts 
to undermine the nation's territorial integrity. 
  4. The US assistant secretary emphasized that Indo-Pak 
disagreements over J and K should be solved within the framework 
of the Simla agreement. Home minister highlighted India's 
renewed offer to Pakistan to schedule another round of foreign 
secretary level talks and dialogue at other levels to underline 
our objective of seeking improvement on all aspects of our 
relations with Pakistan.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto has said Pakistan 
being a peace-loving nation wants peace with its neighbors on 
the basis of honor and equality. Addressing a darbar [meeting] 
of the Punjab Regiment in Mardan today, the prime minister said 
we do not cherish aggressive designs against anyone. However, 
we cannot remain oblivious to our defense which will be 
strengthened within our limited resources. Our neighbors must 
not dream to establish hegemony because we can neither be 
provoked nor submit, she said, adding the people of Jammu and 
Kashmir must be given the right of self-determination and the 
Kashmir issue should be solved in a manner that it leads to 
laying a solid foundation for peace in the region. A 
neighboring country is dreaming to bring us under its hegemony, 
she said, adding we will not be cowed down by anybody. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the government is making every 
endeavor for the welfare of the people. The task is stupendous 
and the problems are many, which need cooperation from every 
segment of society. She said the prime objective before the 
political parties should be to ensure that the country is put on 
the road to progress and prosperity and its image enhanced in 
the community of nations. She, therefore, appealed to the 
people, including political leaders, ulema [religious scholars], 
and students to cooperate with the government in its efforts to 
solve socioeconomic problems. 
  The prime minister commended the Punjab Regiment for its 
glorious services and said the martyrs of the regiment have 
carved out a prominent place in the nation's history by having 
laid down their lives in the defense of the motherland. On this 
occasion, the prime minister announced a grant of 8 million 
rupees for various welfare projects being carried out by the 
regiment. Governor of Punjab retired Lieutenant General 
Mohammad Iqbal Khan, Governor of NWFP [North-West Frontier 
Province] retired Major Gen. Khurshid Ali Khan, Defense Minister 
Mr. Aftab Shaban Mirani, Chief of Army Staff Gen. Abdul Waheed, 
and other high civil and military officials were present on the 
occasion. 
  Earlier, the colonel commandant of the Punjab Regimental 
Center, Lt. Gen. Nasir Akhtar, and Commandant of the center 
Brigadier Qamar Zaman, in their speeches, gave a resume of the 
regiment's historic achievements and its role both in times of 
peace and war. The regiment founded in 1759 in Madras has the 
unique honor of winning of 440 military awards, including four 
Nishan-i-Haider. The colonel commandant presented the regiment's 
crest to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Chief of the Army 
Staff Gen. Abdul Waheed.

  [Text] Indian reply to Pakistan's non-papers for a 
plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir and improvement of human rights 
situation is not positive, as New Delhi seems to be intent on 
skirting around on the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Briefing newsmen in Islamabad today, a Foreign Office 
spokesman recalled that Pakistan had given two non-papers to 
India on the 18th of January for a peaceful solution of Jammu 
and Kashmir issue and other problems. He said it appears from 
reply to these papers that India is going back from a meaningful 
and purposeful discussion on the Jammu and Kashmir issue as 
agreed upon between the two countries. 
  The spokesman said the Indian reply appears to be a 
propaganda exercise camouflaged in diplomatic language and the 
Indians have merely reiterated their old inflexible position on 
Jammu and Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. State Secretary's Statement -- Need for </F>
Further Steps"] 
  [Text] Warren Christopher, the U.S. secretary of state, has 
categorically stated that one of the U.S. priorities is to have 
the nuclear capabilities of both India and Pakistan frozen. He 
said one important priority for us is to find a way in which the 
nuclear capabilities of both India and Pakistan can be frozen 
and conditions be created under which the nuclear threat to 
South Asia is reduced. Speaking at the House of Representatives 
Subcommittee on Appropriations, Warren Christopher disclosed 
that both India and Pakistan are at the threshold of acquiring 
nuclear facility and we are very concerned about that. One more 
issue that is raising its head, he added, is the capability of 
these two countries to deliver nuclear weapons to their targets 
and we are also paying due attention to it. Christopher's 
statement is the first policy statement from the highest level 
official of the Clinton administration, in which an evenhanded 
policy has been adopted toward the nuclear capabilities of both 
India and Pakistan, and which has caused due concern among the 
Indian community living in the United States. According to the 
daily NEWS, Christopher's statement has caused great resentment 
among the Indian community which understands that this new 
statement, which came close on the heels of the U.S. declaring 
Kashmir as a disputed territory, is the reflection of a shift in 
the U.S. attitude. 
  This is a matter of satisfaction that a most important 
official of the U.S. Administration has spoken about the nuclear 
programs of both India and Pakistan in a fair and equitable 
manner, but a mere expression of view by the United States 
cannot be considered adequate to meet the requirements of 
justice. James Moran, a member of the same subcommittee, asked 
Christopher: When you talk of adopting an evenhanded approach 
to the nuclear programs of both India and Pakistan, what is the 
justification for applying the Pressler Amendment only to 
Pakistan and not to India? The secretary of state pointed to 
his other engagements instead of replying to this question and 
sought leave of the committee. This reflects that Warren 
Christopher could not defend the continuation of a 
discriminatory legislation against Pakistan and it was not 
possible for him to prove whether there was any justification 
for the Pressler Amendment in view of Washington's desire to 
treat both India and Pakistan equally. 
  It is true that the signals given in recent weeks indicate 
that the U.S. Administration either intends to totally waive the 
application of the Pressler Amendment or wants to provide 
military aid, especially the F-16 aircraft, to Pakistan by 
finding some exceptional ways even while the Pressler Amendment 
remains effective. However, no practical way has thus far been 
found under which aid to Pakistan can be restored without 
harming its interests. This proves that the talk of equal 
treatment to both India and Pakistan is still in its initial 
stage and the actions of the U.S. Government do not confirm the 
veracity of its pronouncements. If the U.S. Government views 
both India and Pakistan equally in the context of their nuclear 
programs and intends to place them on equal footing, then it 
must abolish the discriminatory legislation like the Pressler 
Amendment or impose the same restrictions on India as are placed 
on Pakistan. If this is not done, then the claims about 
treating both India and Pakistan equally will appear only hollow 
and unreliable. 
  It is no secret that India had exploded a nuclear device 
some 
20 years ago and possesses enormous resources for the 
advancement of its nuclear program. The United States had been 
keeping its eyes closed to India's nuclear program for the past 
20 years. On one occasion, Washington rather directly assisted 
India in acquiring heavy water from France without raising any 
objection to it. The U.S. has also supplied computer technology 
to India, which also can be used for military purposes. In the 
presence of this policy, the U.S. claims about treating India 
and Pakistan equally cannot be accepted to be correct. 
Christopher's statement can be welcomed as a first step 
forward, but Washington needs to do much more to prove that its 
approach is fair. Pakistan has been declaring for the past 10 
years that it is ready to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty provided India also did the same, but the U.S. failed to 
fully use its influence on India to persuade it to do so. It is 
hoped that the statement of the U.S. secretary of state will 
prove to be the first drop of rain for Pakistan and Washington 
will really be able to adopt a fair and equitable policy on 
South Asia and will stop pressuring Islamabad to unilaterally 
"cap" its nuclear program. No Pakistani Government can ever 
think of taking such a step under any greed or pressure, and 
this is a fact which the United States should never overlook.

  [Text] The motion to extend the state of emergency was 
passed in parliament by a majority of 82 votes yesterday. One 
hundred MP's voted for the bill, while 22 [as heard] voted 
against it. 
  Winding up the debate, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe 
said that the objective of the government is to conduct a free 
and fair provincial poll in the south. All candidates have been 
given full police protection, thereby ensuring the right of 
voters to exercise their franchise freely. The government is 
taking measures to strengthen democracy in the country. The 
prime minister thanked the voters and those who were 
instrumental in the successful conclusion of the local elections 
in the east and Vavuniya. He claimed that the result of the 
local elections in the east was the clear indication that 
terrorism had been eliminated. The prime minister said that the 
government has taken measures to develop these areas by 
strengthening the administration in the east. 
  Referring to the security forces' operations in the north 
and 
east, the prime minister said that they had achieved several 
victories against the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] 
terrorists. He claimed that the Tamils in the north and east 
and others were praising the activities of the security forces.

<F P=106> [Article by Arjuna] </F>
  [Text] All parties concerned admit that a peaceful 
solution should be found to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. 
Several local and international organizations have expressed 
willingness to mediate in the issue. Even the two parties 
involved in the conflict have expressed their inclination for 
peace. Nevertheless, what are the factors that hinder these 
peace efforts from making any headway? Today, it is clear that 
the primary reason for this is lack of a clear-cut policy with 
the government in adopting suitable measures to resolve the 
ethnic conflict. 
  The ideas expressed by the president in general meetings on 
the ethnic conflict are totally contrary to those of the prime 
minister. Apart from this, the views expressed by the ministers 
also differ.in Three points stated by President D.B. Wijetunge 
recently on the minorities issue have drawn our attention. He 
says: There is nothing like ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, but it 
is only the menace of terrorism that exists in the country. 
Only the majority community people should rule the country 
forever and the minority should depend on them. There is no 
traditional territory for Tamils in Sri Lanka. The president's 
views on the ethnic conflict have been reflected in these 
statements. 
  At the same time, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe has 
adopted a different approach to the ethnic conflict. He 
projects himself as a person who believes in negotiations to 
find a solution to the conflict. It is ludicrous to note that 
his invitations to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] 
for talks carry different conditions on different occasions. 
Thus, besides differing from the views of the president, he 
contradicts his own statements. 
  Third, ministers have been expressing their own views, 
either 
in favor of or against those of the president and the prime 
minister. The official position of the government should be a 
combination of all these views, but one can come across only 
contradictions here. In other words, their views indicate that 
the government does not have any specific or authenticated stand 
on the ethnic issue. While taking steps to resolve the ethnic 
conflict, it is imperative to form a specific and coordinated 
view, at least at the ministerial level. 
  When the government does not have a specific and unified 
stand on the ethnic conflict, the Sinhalese politicians are 
offering various kinds of false propaganda on the minorities 
issue. This further aggravates the situation in resolving the 
issue. As the Sinhalese are given a wrong impression about the 
Tamils and their demands, it amplifies the feeling of animosity 
and creates a situation which makes it difficult to find a 
solution. 
  Given this situation, the government resorts to military 
action to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the minorities. 
All the military actions taken by the government in the past 
one and a half decades have ended in farce, only leading to the 
destruction of the property of the government and the people. 
However, these military actions could not destroy the 
legitimate aspirations of the people. Today's events indicate 
that these aspirations cannot be wiped out by mere military 
operations. 
  The Tamil community in the north has adapted itself to live 
amid any kind of threat. Normal activities are being carried 
out there despite heavy bombardment and shelling. People are 
used to living amid major economic embargo and transport 
barriers. In Kilaly, boat service is continuing despite air and 
missile attacks. All these things indicate that the Tamils are 
not going to submit to any kind of military pressure. 
  At the same time, the perpetual military pressure and the 
conflict have brought major changes to the social fabric of the 
Northern Tamils. Once Mahatma Gandhi said: The day when a woman 
is able to walk all alone in the streets at midnight can be 
regarded as the day of absolute freedom. A volunteer from a 
service organization who visited Jaffna recently has said that 
such a situation exists only in Jaffna. He has also pointed out 
that the crisis situation which existed before 1985 or from 
1987-90 has changed, and that a peaceful atmosphere prevails 
there now. 
  All these things indicate that the struggle of the Tamil 
people has reached a stage where it is impossible to satisfy the 
legitimate aspirations of the people with inconsistent 
solutions. At the same time, this issue has gained 
international recognition. Human rights and refugee welfare 
organizations have also started showing interest in this issue. 
The government will have to face an embarrassing situation in 
dealing with the pressures being exerted by them. Because, the 
norms like fundamental rights, human rights, and the right to 
self-determination have gained international acclaim. 
Acknowledging these norms will be quite unpleasant for the Sri 
Lankan Government. Therefore, the government would prefer to 
resolve the issue at home itself rather than taking it to the 
international level. 
  Today, everyone understands the need for holding talks with 
the LTTE to resolve the issue. The LTTE theoretician Anton 
Balasingham has already stated that the organization is ready 
for unconditional talks with the government. Although the 
government side speaks of holding talks, this is only lip 
service. Ranil Wickremasinghe, who outlined various 
preconditions on different occasions, says that the response 
should come from Prabhakaran himself and that he should also 
participate in the talks. Anton Balasingham and Karikalan would 
not have given their personal views to the journalists and 
representatives of peace missions who visited Jaffna. They 
would not have said anything without the permission of 
Prabhakaran. Therefore, the condition insisting on Prabhakaran's 
direct participation does not seem to mean anything. 
  Asking a guerrilla organization to lay down its arms first 
and then come to the negotiating table is unprecedented. Past 
experiences also will not help create such a situation. For 
instance, even during the presence of the Indian peacekeeping 
force, the government started installing Sinhalase settlements 
in violation of the accord and delayed the establishment of 
interim government [as published]. Therefore, all Tamils feel 
that it will be suicidal to lay down arms while trusting the 
government, which is in the clutches of the Sinhalese racists. 
  Hence, the process of talks cannot be initiated all of a 
sudden. It can be initiated gradually and stage by stage. To 
achieve this, good diplomatic skill and political will to solve 
the problem is imperative. Those who possessed diplomatic skill 
and political will were only able to resolve major global 
issues. But, as far as Sri Lanka is concerned, is there anyone 
with such qualities? 
  First of all, the government should admit that there is 
ethnic conflict in the country. Second, the government should 
realize that this conflict needs a solution and that it should 
take appropriate steps to achieve this. Mere invitations for 
talks will not be the right initiative to find a solution. In 
the past, the government succeeded in hoodwinking Tamil leaders 
by holding several negotiations with them. Perhaps the reason 
for the government's hesitation to hold negotiations now may be 
that it cannot dupe the Tamil leadership any more.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jasim al-Saqr, chairman of the Kuwaiti </F>
National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee, by Faris al-Salman 
in Kuwait; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Salman] What were the reasons for your 
resignation from the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee? 
  [Al-Saqr] There were many motives for my resignation but I 
do not believe it is appropriate to reveal them. They are 
personal. 
  [Al-Salman] But it has been claimed that the resignation had 
something to do with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  [Al-Saqr] One of the reasons for the resignation was the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement and the lifting of the boycott of Israel, 
perhaps because I belong to a generation which has Arab 
convictions. Generally speaking, my views may not be in harmony 
with the current trend. 
  [Al-Salman] Why did you withdraw the resignation? 
  [Al-Saqr] At the insistence of my colleagues, the Assembly 
members. 
  [Al-Salman] To what extent does the Foreign Affairs 
Committee contribute to the formulation of Kuwait's foreign 
policy? 
  [Al-Saqr] In the previous session the National Assembly 
decided to form a joint overall committee combing the interior 
and defense and foreign affairs committees to submit a study on 
Kuwait's affairs, security, and defense strategy. And indeed we 
did that and I chaired both committees. We began our work 
during the previous session but the task was not completed. 
  [Al-Salman] Why not? 
  [Al-Saqr] Because of the complex diverse issues. We have 
sought the assistance of some academicians, specialists, and 
officers and we intend to seek the help of experts in the Arab 
world, Europe, and the United States. That is why we have 
requested an extension of the committee's deadline by another 
year and the Assembly has granted that request. 
  [Al-Salman] How do you assess the Assembly's achievements? 
  [Al-Saqr] It made good achievements up to the last third of 
the second term. For example, it discussed public funds and 
investments and passed a law for the protection of all public 
funds. All these were achievements. Let us not forget that 
this Assembly came after the catastrophe of the Iraqi occupation 
and it faced challenges in exceptional circumstances not 
experienced by past legislative assemblies. The public believes 
that some priority issues are not worth discussing but we should 
view matters comprehensively and weigh the challenges which 
Kuwait has had to meet. 
  [Al-Salman] What is the National Assembly's position on the 
Damascus Declaration? How do you view it? 
  [Al-Saqr] We back and support the Damascus Declaration 
because we see it as a step in the right direction. If we view 
the Damascus Declaration as an advanced step in the development 
of the Arab League's work and link it to the regional 
organization of the Gulf Cooperation Council states on which we 
pin great hopes, we will see a solid interlinked chain on the 
right road. 
  [Al-Salman] What about Iran? 
  [Al-Saqr] Iran is a neighboring state with which we have 
geographical and historical links. We seek relations based on 
mutual respect. That "respect" is what we wish for.

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has praised the fraternal 
ties between Jordan and the State of Qatar. He voiced pride in 
the brotherhood that binds them, ties that have long existed on 
a very strong basis and on frankness and concern for joint Arab 
interests. 
  In statements to Qatari media today, his majesty expressed 
happiness on his visit to Qatar and for being at the side of his 
brother, his highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani. He 
voiced confidence that relations between the two countries, 
which are built on the strongest of bases, will last, God 
willing. His majesty said: Our aim is to serve and carry out 
our duties toward generations that will come after us throughout 
the Arab homeland. The king alluded to the current difficult 
circumstances and serious challenges. His majesty described 
this visit as part of the efforts aimed at realizing Arab 
solidarity and prosperity for the entire Arab nation. 
  On the call for holding an Arab summit at this stage, His 
Majesty King Husayn said: We have hoped for a very long time to 
hold an Arab summit so that the brother leaders can meet and 
talk frankly on their problems in order to serve their nation's 
present and future. He noted that His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the amir of the State of Qatar, has the same 
desire and hope. The king explained that the date for such a 
summit is left to us and to all the brothers. 
  On the U.S. statements that united Jerusalem will be the 
capital of Israel, his majesty said: Jerusalem is the city we 
hold to be sacred in our hearts, consciences, and minds and 
sovereignty over Jerusalem can only belong to Almighty God. 
  His majesty prayed for God to grant the Arab and Muslim 
leaders success to enable them to play their role and carry out 
their duties and keep Jerusalem for their Islamic nation and the 
believers in God in the place in which it should be.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Lost Peace From Camp David to Oslo"] </F>
  [Excerpts] When al-Sadat ventured to visit Jerusalem, 
which the Arabs found harder to bear than the 1967 defeat, the 
argument for it was that the 1973 war had put the world on a 
different road, that the Arabs were an influential political and 
military force, and, because of economic sensitivity, oil had 
become a card with which to apply pressure on a Western camp 
which had always used war and diplomacy as reflections of 
permanent support for Israel. 
  Whether we accepted or rejected al-Sadat's initiative at the 
time -- and it had its fair share of regional and international 
analyses -- its results may be deemed satisfactory if we 
consider the current situation and how, although the secret Oslo 
talks expedited the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, serious 
concessions have been made giving Israel control of the 
situation in view of the weakness of the Palestinian position, 
which is what Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad warned of when he 
said that the consequences would be devastating for the status 
of the Palestinians and for their rights to their land, to a 
state, and to repatriation. [passage omitted] 
  If the al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre has removed the last 
Israeli fig leaf, it has also exposed the Palestinian weakness 
in the eyes of the peacemakers, so much so that U.S. President 
Clinton did not hesitate to declare Jerusalem Israel's capital 
and to block any UN Security Council resolution condemning the 
massacre, a fact which has set back the peace clock because the 
criteria have moved in the opposite direction through the 
actions of the prime peace sponsor. That outcome has so stunned 
and embarrassed the Palestinians that they called for a meeting 
of the Cordon States, which was tantamount to an admission of 
the bitter reality they had been driven to through uncalculated 
peace steps. 
  Even assuming that the U.S. President was trying to 
rearrange 
his mental and political state in the face of his financial 
scandals, he did utter what he said he would during his election 
campaign -- thereby indicating that he was keeping his promise 
to Israel and that the Arabs should close this subject in peace 
negotiations to come later in the more distant future.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Seven Yemeni Soldiers Killed </F>
Near Shabwah"] 
  [Excerpts] Seven soldiers from north and south Yemen were 
killed in an exchange of fire yesterday as some trucks moved 
from Ma'rib (in the north) to Bayhan in the governorate of 
Shabwah (in the south). 
  Opposition sources in Aden see this as a major blow to the 
signs of relaxation which some thought were recently beginning 
to appear as the cabinet held meetings in Aden at the invitation 
of Prime Minister Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. Informed 
sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the trucks were 
carrying arms from the north and were intercepted by southern 
military units on the desert road linking the governorates of 
Shabwah (in the south) and Ma'rib in the north. In the ensuing 
exchange of fire seven soldiers were killed outright on both 
sides and the southern forces seized three trucks. Three other 
trucks managed to turn back, but three are still missing. 
  The sources emphasized that this incident, which occurred 
yesterday, was quickly contained by the Military Coommittee, 
which is continuing its tour of Shabwah Governorate in the 
course of its plan to end military moves on both sides. 
  Political sources in Aden have stated that the cabinet, 
which 
met in Aden yesterday for the first time after a three-month 
suspension, formed three committees: One to study security 
matters, one to prepare constitutional amendments, and one to 
study the requirements of the Dialogue Committee and help it 
play its role of controlling the organs that will implement the 
Pledge and Accord Document. 
  The sources regard the measures taken by the government at 
yesterday's meeting to be a violation of the provisions of the 
Pledge and Accord Document. [passage omitted] 
  Opposition sources in Aden said after the annoucement of the 
government's formation of these committees that what had 
happened was "the first clear violation of the Amman agreement" 
and that it was not up to the government to form a 
constitutional amendment committee because that was within the 
jurisdiction of the Dialogue Committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani, </F>
representative of the Yemeni Alliance for Reform in the 
Presidential Council, by Amin Muhammad Amin in Sanaa; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani, member of the 
Yemeni Presidential Council representing the Yemeni Alliance for 
Reform [YAR], has affirmed that his party wishes to resolve all 
existing differences between the General People's Congress Party 
[GPC] in the north and the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] in the 
south. He said his party does not wish to exploit the current 
differences between the two parties to obtain seats of power in 
the country. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM held at his residence in 
Sanaa, 
Shaykh al-Zanadani said that the YSP wants to internationalize 
the Yemeni crisis and move it from the House of Representatives 
to the international community. He clarified that the YAR, the 
third member of the coalition in the government, wants to keep 
the Yemeni issue in the hands of its sons. It does not want the 
dispute to go outside Arab circles for a solution. 
  The Presidential Council member noted that his party insists 
on telling the truth, a step that does not satisfy either of the 
sides to the dispute. We demand that the people's will be 
respected in accordance with the Pledge and Accord Document. We 
call for presenting all our issues before the House of 
Representatives to discuss them and pass the resolutions that 
bind all sides. 
  On the conflict between the GPC and the YSP regarding how to 
implement the document, in which the YSP is demanding that those 
charged in the assassinations be arrested first, he said that 
his party supports the GPC on the need to merge the state 
institutions before arresting the defendants, especially since 
the government is a coalition between three parties. 
  Responding to a question on the role the YAR could play in 
arresting the suspects in the assassinations, he said we always 
stand by the truth and do not accuse anyone. We demand a fair 
trial and the elimination of political influences on decisions. 
He affirmed that the road to power can only be through the 
ballot box. 
  Regarding the various accusations that the YAR practices 
terrorism, he said: I am one of those who experienced an 
assassination attempt and acts of terrorism before the 
parliamentary elections. However, the current conflict prompted 
some sides, especially the YSP, to exploit the issue of 
terrorism, in particular with some Arab countries that do not 
know the facts behind the conflict in Yemen. The truth is that 
there are political and tribal conflicts and that a state of 
vengeance exists between the YSP in the south and a number of 
citizens whose sons, brothers, and family members were killed. 
Therefore, the problem of revenge will continue to be a time 
bomb in Yemen if it is not wisely handled. 
  He noted that the YAR presented a proposal for resolving the 
problem of vengeance in Yemen. The proposal includes signing an 
agreement and issuing a decision on stopping Yemeni bloodshed 
and then setting a date for a general pardon of past incidents. 
All the chapters of vengeful acts before this date will be 
closed and the national interests of Yemen will be promoted 
henceforth. 
  All murders and acts of revenge that take place after that 
date will fall under Islamic laws and punishments. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani denied accusations that he 
harbors terrorism and heads the military wing of the YAR. He 
said that there were some youths who were very religious and 
found out that some people in Aden were behaving in an 
un-Islamic manner. They found out, for example, that there is an 
alcoholic beverage plant in Aden and that the police killed 
demonstrators in the al-Rahman mosque in Aden. As a result, 
some of these youths adopted violence as a course. Moreover, 
the YAR advised them to follow peaceful means to find out the 
truth and handle the situation. Some of them heeded our call 
and returned to the path of righteousness. 
  He said that Usamah Bin-Ladin [prominent Saudi businessman] 
has a group who follow him and carry out some terrorist acts. 
But some of them regained their senses and backed out of the 
acts they were supposed to commit. 
  He clarified that the Islamic nation is torn between two 
cultures. The first is the culture of decline, which has 
distorted Islam. The second is the culture of colonialism, 
which casts doubts over Islam. This is why we all have to work 
on protecting the fierce onslaught against Islam. 
  The member of the Presidential Council affirmed the absence 
of an armed wing in the YAR. He said the Yemeni people are 
armed anyway. However, we do not call for reform through weapons 
and killing, but through wisdom and sound advice. 
  On acts of terrorism in Egypt and accusations that he 
supports them and harbors some of the Egyptian terrorist groups 
in Yemen, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani said: I love Egypt 
and lived there for quite some time. This is why I cannot carry 
out terrorist acts against it. What harms our Egypt, harms us 
also. We wish it all the best. We are ready to fully cooperate 
with it to annihilate terrorism, which is hiding behind the veil 
of the true Islamic religion. 
  He said that Yemen is too small to be a source for exporting 
terrorism to fraternal Egypt. 
  Regarding the presence of a terrorist camp that he allegedly 
patronizes in the region of Sa'dah in the north supervised by 
Shaykh Muqbil, the Presidential Council member said that he does 
not order people to carry weapons; he fights violence and 
terrorism. We have recorded tapes of Shaykh Muqbil in which he 
condemns terrorism. He added: I informed Ambassador 'Ata' 
Harun, the ambassador from Egypt to Yemen, that we are ready to 
welcome the visit by any Egyptian official to the headquarters 
of Shaykh Muqbil in Sa'dah to learn about his school that 
teaches the Koran and the true religion and whose students are 
from various nationalities who wish to learn about Islam. It is 
not a camp for exporting terrorism. 
  Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zanadani concluded his speech: We do 
not approve the principle of change through force and the use of 
violence and terrorism. At the same time, we cannot allow Yemen 
to be a country from which Egypt is harmed.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--A responsible security source 
at the Ministry of Interior today said that security men had 
uncovered an "arsenal" containing large quantities of explosives 
and bombs inside a den belonging to a terrorist in the `Ayn 
Shams Buildings' area in Cairo. The terrorist is wanted for 
involvement in recent terrorist crimes, particularly attacks 
against banks in greater Cairo. 
  The source pointed out that when the den was stormed, the 
terrorist was not found there, but sketches indicating the 
locations of some important installations, banks, and targeted 
individuals in Cairo and al-Jizah were found, in preparation for 
carrying out a plan. 
  The same source added that the State Security Intelligence 
Department had received information that terrorist Mustafa 
Muhammad Ibrahim Siddiq, better known as Zaghlul, was taking 
refuge at a hideout in the 'Ayn Shams Buildings. Investigations 
revealed he was involved in the recent bank bombings. Inside 
the hideout, security men found parts of RPG launchers, two 
homemade guns, a quantity of highly explosive TNT, and a roll of 
fuse used in bombings. A camera, a number of cans used for 
making explosive devices, and some "organizational" documents 
containing the names of some important figures and targeted 
senior police officials were also found in the den.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Chief Editor Mahfuz al-Ansari: "Clinton and </F>
Jerusalem; Miscalculation and Conditional Peace"] 
  [Text] We may understand the dilemma of U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and his wife Hillary. We may even sympathize with this 
young couple who rule the White House and wield the helm of 
world events, or so we think. We understand the nervous 
pressure and frayed confidence of the strongest man in the world 
when his job is placed on the line and his position is 
jeopardized by a scandal that threatens to drown him in 
Whitewater, a scandal reminiscent of President Nixon's Watergate. 
  We may also sense the influence and see the fingerprints of 
some U.S. officials who are concerned with the Middle East 
crisis on Washington's tendencies, policies, statements, and, of 
course, decisions. Among these officials are Dennis Ross, the 
chief coordinator; Daniel Kurtzer, deputy assistant secretary of 
state; Martin Indyk, National Security Council and White House 
official; and Aaron Miller, Ross's assistant. 
  But there are things that we fail to understand, comprehend, 
or even imagine and, therefore, find unacceptable and 
objectionable. 
  For example: 
  -- We fail to understand why President Clinton should try to 
emerge from his dilemma at the expense of the truth, why he 
should make an offer for which someone else would foot the bill, 
and why he should present Jerusalem as a sacrifice at the alter 
to please certain people, hoping that they may then back him and 
make the Whitewater affair disappear before it ends his career 
as Watergate ended Nixon's. 
  -- We find it unacceptable and objectionable that the judge, 
partner, and mediator should hand down his final verdict in the 
case before the defense has ended its presentation, before the 
case is summed up, before the contestants are brought into 
court, and before the rivals face each other at the negotiating 
table. 
  -- We object to Clinton's issuing a unilateral decision that 
undermines the international order, violates the legitimacy of 
its resolution, and slaps the members of the international 
community in the face. 
  -- We find it incomprehensible and bewildering that 
President 
Clinton should break with his country's tradition and turn his 
back on its known positions for the past 27 years. That is, 
from June 1967 until Clinton declared unified Jerusalem as 
Israel's capital. 
  For 27 years, for more than a quarter of a century -- 
President Johnson, who instigated, planned, funded, armed, and 
orchestrated the 1967 aggression, could not declare or state 
that Jerusalem was Israel's capital; and Presidents Nixon, Ford, 
Carter, Reagan, and Bush stopped short of what Clinton, all of a 
sudden and with bizarre timing, did. 
  On the contrary, for a quarter century resolutions were 
issued, statements were declared, and positions were stated by 
successive U.S. Administrations, the UN General Assembly, and 
the UN Security Council, all of which emphasized that East 
Jerusalem is part of the Arab territories occupied in 1967. 
  An element of flexibility had been advocated by James Baker, 
the former U.S. secretary of state, who maintained that the 
peace process should begin by addressing the easy issues. This, 
he reasoned, should lead to progress and generate momentum that 
could be useful in addressing the difficult and intricate issues 
at a later stage. The idea, then, was not to make concessions 
and compromises for their own sake, but to expand the areas of 
agreement through discussion of less thorny matters. That is, 
once a climate of understanding and a spirit of mutual 
confidence had been created, difficult matters would be brought 
to the table. 
  President Clinton's declaration, although made during a 
private meeting with U.S. Jewish leaders, does not show the 
astuteness of a "professional" statesman as much as it betrays 
the opinion of an "amateur politician". There's a big 
difference between amateurism and professionalism. 
  Amateurism is a whim, a personal inclination motivated by 
bias and fed by emotions. Professionalism is a job, work, and 
responsibility. 
  Professionalism means calculations, assessments, and rules. 
It has principles and codes of conduct. Anyone who disregards 
them breaks the rules. If he circumvents them, he violates the 
law. If he breaks the rules and transgresses, he is taken to 
account. 
  Governing -- particularly on a very high level, on a state 
level, indeed on a universal level, as the case is with the U.S. 
President -- must signify justice and responsibility. It must 
never be an attention grabbing "arbitrary move" that shifts the 
focus from Whitewater to Jerusalem, or from the Hebron massacre 
to an assault on a Lebanese church or a monastery in al-Qusiyah, 
Egypt. 
  Governing should signify decisions and statements that have 
been thoroughly thought out, sober conduct, and a word of reason 
at this difficult, embarrassing time. 
  During a recent meeting with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] -- 
at 
a time when his chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th had just returned 
from Washington following lengthy meetings with Christopher and 
his aides -- Abu-'Ammar disclosed part of the news Sha'th had 
brought to him from the U.S. capital. Among the things he 
revealed were some of the reasons for the obstruction of a UN 
Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre. The most 
important of these reasons was a "firm, stern, and emphatic U.S. 
refusal to allow any direct or indirect reference to Jerusalem." 
There was a U.S. commitment to "banning the word Jerusalem from 
the draft of the resolution and subsequently from the resolution 
itself." 
  Everyone was perplexed by this strange attitude and this 
intransigence and insistence because the draft resolution 
included nothing new about Jerusalem. It added nothing new, 
made no new request, and did not emphasize a principle that some 
people were trying to obliterate. 
  All that the Palestinians asked for was that the draft and 
the final wording of the resolution should include a passing 
reference to Security Council Resolution 799 of 1992. It was 
meant to be a reference to that resolution in the wake of the 
Hebron massacre. Resolution 799 speaks of implementing the 
fourth Geneva Convention pertaining to territories and residents 
living under occupation, including occupied Palestinian 
territories in the West Bank and Gaza, including Jerusalem. 
  This reference to a binding UN resolution and a firm 
international principle -- a resolution and principle accepted 
by the United States when the vote on Resolution 799 was taken 
in 1992 -- was now unacceptable, prohibited, and a taboo. 
  No one knew at that point the reason for the prohibition of 
something which had, in fact, been accepted and agreed upon as a 
matter of course. 
  It was to be a Palestinian reference, a necessary one after 
the Hebron massacre proved that Palestinians under occupation 
enjoy no form of protection whatsoever. 
  People became apprehensive at this point and the 
Palestinians 
realized something "was being cooked up" in the dark. The 
perplexity and fear persisted until President Clinton revealed 
his intentions and "detonated his bombshell" in the dark. 
Israel Radio then lifted the veil and "laid it bare". 
  This attitude to the resolution and its draft form, to which 
the U.S. negotiators adhered throughout the Security Council's 
deliberations, was based on frank, definite, and clear 
instructions from the White House. It does not reflect the U.S. 
Administration's calculations. It rather shows "a deception." 
It reflects a circumvention and contradiction of former 
positions and commitments. It shows an abandonment of the 
responsibility the United States bears as a full partner in the 
peace process. 
  This position reflects a bias, indeed a U.S.-Israeli 
alliance, against the Arabs. 
  Perhaps this maneuver or change in the U.S. position would 
have been acceptable before Oslo and before the signing ceremony 
at the White House. Perhaps this position could have been the 
subject of discussion, argument, and negotiations before the 
Hebron massacre. But after the signing ceremony at the White 
House and the festival of martyrdom in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, 
it is impermissible for the United States -- irrespective of the 
personal reasons of President Clinton and his wife Hillary -- to 
adopt such a stand, unless the game is much bigger than this, 
the deception hides behind it a greater tragedy, and the peace 
process for which we are sincerely working is a big lie. 
  I am afraid that President Clinton's calculations and 
assessment of the overall situation were the result of political 
amateurism and not responsible professionalism, which is 
necessary for one who occupies this high position at the center 
of the empire that runs the affairs of the entire world. 
  This political amateurism may have been nurtured or 
attracted 
by an easy or naive calculation based on the facts and 
developments at that moment. This naive and tempting 
calculation may have been based on dealing with the situation in 
light of the material relations between the forces. These 
material relations say that Israel is now the strongest country 
as a result of its alliance with the United States, its military 
arsenal, nuclear bombs, and internal cohesion, despite the 
internal struggle for leadership and power. 
  The material relations also say that the Arabs are now at 
the 
peak of their division and weakness. They also say that this 
weakness and disintegration have led many Arab states to run 
after Israel, seeking science, knowledge, experience, money, 
gain, and good administration. Many of the Arabs have rushed to 
compete for the Israeli treasures. 
  This is the general picture of the relations and balance 
between the forces in the area. There are those who seek 
progress, wealth, and knowledge from Israel and those who have 
placed security in the back or front of their minds as their 
main concern and have imagined that a military alliance with 
Israel in the near or distant future will spare them from the 
evil of troublemakers among their Arab brothers who covet their 
territory and wealth. They also imagined that this will spare 
them from the evil of the troublemakers among the Muslim 
brothers in the neighboring countries who are seeking to restore 
past glories by establishing a Muslim empire that transcends 
borders. This, as we said, is the material calculation, the 
calculation based on the relations and balance between the 
forces. This is a misleading calculation as much as it is 
tempting. Furthermore, there is a difference between weakness 
resulting from a defect in relations between the forces and 
capitulation, which is out of the question. 
  Therefore, the reality is very different and the reasons 
for that are many. For the foreseeable future at least, 
military superiority has become ineffective. Nuclear and 
military potentials have, to a large extent, become inoperative 
and useless. We have the example of the second superpower, which 
broke down and collapsed on itself while possessing the largest 
weapons arsenal of all kinds. It also had the largest supply of 
resources, expertise, and scientists on the face of the earth. 
  We have the second example in South Africa, which was 
founded 
as a racial state in the same year as racial Israel was founded, 
1948. Both of them came to be part of the post-World War II 
arrangements. 
  The whites established their racial state there and deprived 
around 30 million people, that is the black Africans and sons of 
the area, of their land. The whites armed themselves with 
everything and deprived the others of everything. They armed 
themselves with education, monopolized work including 
agriculture, built an atomic bomb, set up a military arsenal, 
and at the end of the road, discovered that the world had 
changed. 
  They found out that arrangements made after World War II had 
collapsed and were being replaced by post-Cold War arrangements. 
  They discovered that they were up against the wall and had 
no 
other option but coexistence, dismantling the racial state, and 
building a democratic state. They discovered that bullets were 
blank and grenades had no triggers. 
  They changed and decided to bravely join the rest of the 
world, led wisely, expertly, and with good intentions by de 
Klerk. They made way for free elections for all -- for the 
blacks, the whites, and the coloreds -- elections that will take 
place on 27 April. 
  They decided to go ahead despite the fact that they know the 
results beforehand -- the black majority will win. However, 
they did not withdraw, as Rabin is doing today. 
  The noticeable fact is that the two racial states, Israel 
and 
South Africa, were founded in 1948. 
  Also, in both cases peace negotiations based on change 
started in 1992. 
  The difference is the regression, through massacres, in 
Palestine and the progress, despite problems, in South Africa. 
  The second fact in the unseen, intangible, and invisible 
formula is that when Israel accepts or shows readiness to accept 
a part of the land under a just peace, it should do so on the 
condition that the Palestinians regain their rights and land, 
topped by Jerusalem. 
  This condition is binding, not only to Israel, but even to 
those who have competed to sign secret agreements with Israel, 
be they security or cooperation agreements. 
  The region and its people have accepted peace as a condition 
for cooperation -- a just, fair, and equitable peace. 
  Anything less than this is rejected and unimplementable; no 
one can impose it on them. 
  Therefore, the real calculations of the superpowers do not 
rely on material and military relations. In actual fact, they 
rely on general popular acceptance by all the countries and 
peoples in the region. This is the effective and decisive 
factor. Anything less than this, is a fancy flitting through 
the minds of amateurs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Haftar: Our Army Open to All Libyans"] </F>
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Staff Colonel Khalifah 
Abu-al-Qasim Haftar, commander of the opposition "Libyan 
National Army," has announced that the army "is a partner in the 
efforts to establish the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, 
of which it is an original part. It advocates the movements' 
aims and complies with its struggle and political programs. 
However, its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our 
people, regardless of their political affiliations." 
  This came in a statement issued yesterday by Haftar. It 
includes an affirmation that the opposition army is "an integral 
part of our national Armed Forces inside the country, and it 
considers itself a vanguard force for all honorable 
oppositionists, regardless of their political affiliations.... 
It is an army for all Libyans in order to achieve the aims of 
national struggle." 
  The statement adds: "The Libyan National Army, which has 
decided to split from the National Front for the Salvation of 
Libya to look for a new struggle formula through which to carry 
out its national tasks, considers itself a partner in the 
establishment of the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform..., 
but its ranks will remain open to all the sons of our heroic 
people who are prepared to offer their lives and contribute on 
the field for the sake of their country's cause, regardless of 
their political affiliations and as long as they are committed 
to the basic aims of national struggle and the army's laws, 
rules, and practical programs." 
  It also stresses the army's commitment to "the national 
character of the battle" against the Libyan regime, and its 
"belief that this battle should rely entirely on national 
material and human energies and capabilities inside and outside 
the country and through a comprehensive plan in which all 
efforts and capabilities should be united for the sake of 
serving and achieving the major strategic aims of our heroic 
people's struggle." 
  The statement also stresses "commitment to the 
constitutional 
legitimacy represented in the affirmation of the noble people's 
right to be in charge of decisionmaking with regard to all that 
concerns the system of government and to choose their own 
institutions." The army's implementation of "its practical 
struggle program will be parallel with the political struggle 
espoused by the Libyan Movement for Change and Reform, aimed at 
achieving legitimate national demands through the programs of 
political and military action." 
  It then appeals to "all the sincere sons of the homeland who 
are seeking salvation and freedom...to take a strong, 
courageous, and unified stand and rise up to close ranks, unite 
their efforts, and channel their energies and capabilities to 
achieve the strategic national aims represented in our people's 
aspiration to a life of pride, dignity, freedom, and democracy." 
  The statement welcomes "the joining of the army by the 
honorable brothers Staff Brigadier General Salim al-Hajjaji, 
Major Ahmad al-Fituri, and Captain Anwar Abu-Ghaliyah, who have 
joined the army," hoping that their position will be "a blessed 
start for this new phase in the march of Libyan national 
struggle."

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Rabia'a [March] 24 (JAMAHIRIYA NEWS 
AGENCY) -- In a proposal presented to the United Nations, the 
United States called for Japan and Germany to be permanent 
members of the Security Council. 
  The Cable News Network, CNN, said that the American 
ambassador to the United Nations presented this in the form of a 
proposal. 
  The international affairs editor commented saying: At a time 
when we have been saying that the time has long become overdue 
for a review and reorganising of the United Nations on a new 
basis where all nations would have an equal role in it and would 
serve to extract it from the quagmire it has fallen into as a 
result of the hegemony of the Western countries over it. These 
Western countries transformed the United Nations into an 
instrument to repress other nations. 
  Thus, by changing the United Nations along these lines, as 
proposed repeatedly by the leader of the revolution, is a matter 
which concerns all those countries represented in the United 
Nations given that the Security Council is the council of all 
the nations. Consequently, any change made to the council is the 
prerogative of all the nations it represents. Such changes 
should be put to these nations for discussion and so they can 
give their opinion. 
  The editor said that the inclusion of Germany and Japan in 
the Security Council was not decided by the member countries of 
the United Nations, they didn't discuss it nor did they make any 
decision and they shouldn't be forced into accepting any 
decision they weren't involved in making. The editor said that 
this trend which involves opening the door to permanent 
membership in the Security Council and granting the right of 
veto solely to the powerful industrialised nations indicates a 
move towards crushing the less powerful nations which sufferred 
greatly from the monopoly the powerful nations have over the 
right of veto, a sitution they continue to suffer from. 
Therefore, there has to be a reassessment of the right of veto 
itself so that decision making will be in the hands of the 
General Assembly of the United Nations, that is, in the hands of 
all the members of this organisation. 
  China had rejected any change to be made to the Security 
Council without being put to the General Assembly of the United 
Nations so they can give their approval. 
  The editor said that all the talk underway about allowing 
Japan and Germany to become permanent members of the Security 
Council, where the spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry 
stated, in January, that China sees that a re-structuring of the 
Security Council and the inclusion of Japan and Germany as 
permanent members, could never meet with the approval of the 
less powerful nations and that such a matter should be put to 
all the member countries of the General Assembly of the United 
Nations before any new member is allowed to join the Security 
Council.

<F P=106> [From the "New at Ten" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] His majesty the king returned home today after 
visits to Oman and Qatar and talks with Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id 
and Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani. [passage omitted] 
  His majesty expressed satisfaction at his visits and told 
the 
"News at Ten" that everything was back to normal. 
  [Begin recording] [Husayn] It was excellent. I really had an 
opportunity to have a very frank and open discussion with all my 
brethren whom I met during these last few days in Oman, where we 
have had excellent relations throughout our history. And in 
Qatar, they were established many years ago on a very solid 
foundation of confidence and trust. I think everything is back 
to normal and our views are, I believe, much the same, as we 
face problems and challenges throughout this region and in this 
life. 
  [Reporter] Do you care to say anything about what happened 
yesterday [23 March] in Hebron? 
  [Husayn] I was shocked to hear what happened on the news. 
And obviously, we'll be seeing what details emerge. Right now, 
not much details are available here. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty, where do you see the future of 
Jerusalem, especially with the latest events? 
  [Husayn] That's a very difficult question to respond to 
immediately now. What I have felt over a long period of time is 
that the holy places in Jerusalem -- important to all of us -- 
should revert to only the sovereignty of God over them. 
Important to all believers. Beyond that, as far as the Muslim 
holy places are concerned, we have called, as you know, for a 
body that would represent all the different schools within our 
Islamic world to share in addressing the problem. We are the 
custodians of these holy places, hopefully, in the future. And 
we've also encouraged interfaith dialogue between the followers 
of the three great religions. [end recording] 
  His majesty also told Jordan Television that Jordan was 
seeking clarification on the American position regarding the 
status of Jerusalem. He added that Jordan is also seeking 
assurances that nothing has changed with regards to Jerusalem as 
an occupied Arab land. The king stressed that Jordan recognizes 
no sovereignty over the holy city except that of God almighty.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "King Husayn's Successful Visits </F>
to the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar"] 
  [Text] The successful visits His Majesty King Husayn made 
to the Sultanate of Oman and to Qatar, and his meetings with 
Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id and His Highness Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been the culmination of his majesty's 
continuous efforts to restore cohesion to the Arab ranks in 
order to confront the dangerous stage through which our nation 
is passing. 
  Jordan, Oman, and Qatar have identical positions on Arab 
solidarity, joint Arab action, and the need to begin a new Arab 
stage that overcomes the negative elements of the past and takes 
into consideration the Arab nation's interest and future. 
However, some Arab positions are still hostage to these 
negative elements and fail to overcome them. Furthermore, these 
positions adhere to weak arguments and advance stands that are 
based on deceptive imaginations and facts which aim to implement 
the biggest conspiracy that targeted Iraq and the Arab nation as 
a whole in what was called the Gulf crisis. 
  His majesty the king's statements to the Qatari media and 
Jordanian journalists reflect Jordan's firm and principled 
commitment to the higher pan-Arab interests and eagerness to 
maintain the minimum joint Arab action. The statements also 
demonstrate the efforts with sincere brothers to overcome the 
disaster and to start laying down new bases for Arab solidarity, 
based on mutual respect, eagerness to maintain the nation's 
rights and interests, and coordination of positions on peace 
negotiations, the status of Jerusalem, and support for the 
steadfastness of the kinsfolk in the occupied territories in 
face of occupation and in their just struggle to restore their 
legitimate rights, led by restoration of occupied Palestinian 
territories and the right to self-determination. 
  Undoubtedly, His Majesty King Husayn's emphasis on the 
status 
of Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories, as stipulated 
in all international resolutions, and on linking the fate of the 
holy city to the current Arab situation is a renewed call on 
Arab leaders to meet, have frank discussion, evaluate what 
happened so far in peace negotiations, and coordinate Arab 
positions on Jerusalem in particular, and the Arab causes in 
general.

Arab world. He told the Yemeni magazine ADWA' AL-YAMAN that his 
majesty had strong belief that the Arab nation at large was

  Dr. al-Majali said his majesty had sincerely extended a hand 
of reconciliation to all Arabs, particularly at the current 
stage when the Arab world was facing a critical time on the new 
world order and regional order. 
  The prime minister said the Hebron mosque massacre was a 
heinous and unprecedented crime whereas unarmed victims were 
murdered in cold blood at the sacred shrine. 
  Dr. al-Majali said peace was a strategic Arab quest which 
should not be abandoned.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that U.S. special envoy 
Dennis Ross promised the Jordanian Government to consider easing 
U.S. pressures on Jordan. These pressures have recently been 
intensified with the aim of forcing Jordan to sign a separate 
peace treaty with the Israelis. The U.S. envoy, however, 
refused to make any promises that these pressures would be 
lifted. He said only that his government would study the 
Jordanian demands. 
  The U.S. Administration stepped up its pressures on Jordan 
during the U.S. envoy's tour of the region by intercepting ships 
and holding them in international waters, sometimes for over a 
week, on the pretext of inspecting them or the claim that they 
are carrying banned goods bound for Iraq. 
  Washington asked the Jordanian Government through its envoy 
Dennis Ross to end the second and third degree Arab boycott of 
Israel and support the Arab states calling for the lifting of 
this boycott at the Arab League meetings in Cairo next Saturday. 
  The U.S. envoy said that the continuation of the U.S. and 
European aid to Jordan is conditional on Amman's response to the 
following specific U.S. terms and conditions: 
  1. Expediting negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track. 
  2. Sparing talk about the issue of Jerusalem because this 
will be discussed in the final stages of the peace process. 
  3. Ending the Arab boycott of Israel and dealing with the 
U.S. companies that trade with Israel, have branches in Israel, 
or are engaged in joint ventures with the Israelis. This will 
be a prelude to eventually dealing with the Israeli companies 
and to opening Jordanian markets to their products. 
  4. Canceling the government protectionism of some 
domestic products and allowing for free trade. 
  5. Intensifying the embargo on Iraq and banning the entry 
of any mechanical [ali] materials except through the United 
Nations. 
  6. Suspending Jordanian media campaigns against the 
Israeli policy and stopping the mobilization of the masses 
against Israel. 
  7. Ending the activities of the Palestinian organizations 
opposing the U.S. policy, and pursuing their members. 
  8. Pursuing the hardline Islamic current that is hostile 
to U.S. policy, and supporting the moderate Islamists who do not 
engage in politics. According to the U.S. proposal, this will 
be a cover for government pursuit of political Islamists. 
  9. Cooperating with the United States in pursuing 
international terrorism. 
  10. Expediting the implementation of the International 
Monetary Fund reforms. 
  AKHBAR AL-USBU' has also learned that the U.S. 
Administration 
has asked its friends in the region not to support Jordan on the 
political, economic, or media levels as a retribution for its 
positions. It is also seeking to isolate Jordan and besiege it 
politically and economically in order to force it to yield to 
the U.S.-Israeli conditions. 
  Sources in the U.S. delegation that accompanied Mr. Ross on 
his Amman visit voiced resentment over the harsh Jordanian 
campaign the Jordanian House of Representatives launched against 
the U.S. policy a few hours before the U.S. envoy's arrival. 
Responding to this, a responsible Jordanian source said: The 
Americans can ask the deputies and parties. The Jordanian 
Government does not officially interfere in this. These are 
popular demands and Jordan is a democratic country. 
  In a related development, an Arab official in Washington 
confirmed to AKHBAR AL-USBU' that in the wake of Security 
Council Resolution 904, which condemned the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, Jordan began to face tremendous U.S. pressure to 
expedite the peace process with Israel. He added: These 
pressures are represented in the U.S. retraction of a commitment 
to lift the siege on the port of al-'Aqabah and in growing media 
campaigns against the pan-Arab Jordanian position so that Jordan 
will continue to be isolated on the Arab level, in addition to 
threats to withhold U.S. and European financial aid. The impact 
of the U.S. pressure and threats on the Jordanian track of the 
peace process will be weak and will not serve the cause of 
peace, nor will any economic or political embargo that leads to 
Jordan's isolation serve the cause of peace. 
  Continuing, he said: The onslaught on Jordan has been 
exposed to the Jordanian people, who are suffering from the 
siege on al-'Aqabah. Moreover, there is interference to prevent 
pan-Arab cooperation and coordination with Syria to get out of 
the Israeli bottleneck, which the United States is strongly 
seeking to impose on the peace tracks, especially the Jordanian 
track, and expedite a solution in accordance with the Israeli 
concept.

  [Text] Within the framework of the U.S. efforts to isolate 
and pressure Jordan, the Egyptian prime minister's visit to 
Jordan has been postponed for the second time for no good 
reason. The Egyptian Government asked the Jordanian Government 
to postpone the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Committee meetings, 
which were scheduled to be held at the end of this month, to 
another date to be fixed through bilateral contacts. According 
to Egyptian sources, the meetings will be held in April. The 
Egyptian Government attributed this postponement to Egyptian 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi's preoccupation with urgent 
domestic and foreign affairs. 
  Official Jordanian sources were displeased with the 
last-minute Egyptian request, the second of its kind, as it 
indicates that the Egyptian Government is not serious about 
strengthening its relations with Jordan. 
  It will be recalled that Jordanian-Egyptian relations have 
been strained due to the Gulf war and the Middle East peace 
process, for which Egypt is apparently very enthusiastic, not to 
mention the profit and loss factors.

  [Text] Amman--The Lower House of Parliament on Tuesday [22 
March] condemned the U.S. abstention from voting on references 
to the status of Jerusalem and other Israeli-occupied 
territories in Friday's U.N. Security Council resolution 
condemning the Feb. 25 massacre at a mosque in the West Bank 
town of Hebron. 
  In a statement issued on the last day of its first regular 
session, the House said the U.S. abstention during voting on 
Resolution 904 signalled a "clear change in the American stand," 
which had hitherto viewed Jerusalem as well as other Palestinian 
territories as occupied. 
  "The Lower House of Parliament condemns the American 
position 
and calls on the parliaments of Arab and Islamic countries as 
well as those of countries which support just causes to protest 
against the American stand," the statement said. 
  The Lower House said it "deeply regretted the weak 
coordination among the Arab delegations at the world body" 
leading to the adoption of the resolution which did not satisfy 
the Arab position. 
  It was an indirect swipe at the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO), which held extensive consultations with the 
U.S. on the wording of Resolution 904 since it was first drafted 
shortly after the Feb. 25 massacre. 
  The delay was caused by American insistence on deleting 
parts 
of the draft and differences with the PLO on the phrasing and 
wording of the document. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said in a recent interview that 
Jordan was not a party to the consultations over the draft and 
noted that he had launched a personal effort to come up with a 
joint Arab stand vis-a-vis the issue a few hours before the 
Security Council adopted the resolution. 
  The king said the door would not have been open for the U.S. 
to abstain on parts of the resolution had the document omitted 
any specific reference to Jerusalem and referred to the 
territories that Israeli occupied in the 1967 war in a general 
context. 
  The American abstention has sounded alarm bells in Jordan, 
which saw Washington's posture as paving the way for the 
eventual recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
  Since 1967, the U.S. stand on the occupied territories had 
remained constant based on the rejection of Israeli occupation 
of the land until Friday's vote, which cast doubts on the U.S. 
intentions. 
  The American stand was viewed as an intentional 
precedent-setting move to eventually change its rejection of 
Israel's unilateral annexation of East Jerusalem. 
  The king said he was seeking an expalantion from Washington 
whether there was any shift in the U.S. stand. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said after the 
vote that Washington did not want to prejudge the outcome of 
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations by adopting any position 
on issues involved in the conflict. 
  Officials said Tuesday that the issue was to be raised 
during 
talks with U.S. envoy Dennis Ross who was paying a brief visit 
to Amman late Tuesday. 
  "We hope to get some explanation of the American stand and 
what its obstention means," said one highly-placed official (see 
separate story). 
  Tuesday's parliament statement also expressed regret that 
Resolution 904, adopted after "three weeks of delays and 
procrastination...only condemned the massacre, carried out by 
Zionist settlers aided by the occupation forces, and did not 
condemn the Israeli authorities responsible for the massacre." 
  The statement called on Arab leaders to put aside their 
differences and convene a summit conference to discuss the 
"situation of the Palestinian people living under Zionist 
occupation" and to "shoulder their responsibilities towards 
Palestinians who are subjected to consistent campaigns of 
genocide." 
  The House voiced appreciation "of the steadfastness of the 
Palestinian people and their commitment to their land and their 
rights" and reaffimed Jordan's support for the Palestinian 
struggle for liberation.

  [Excerpts] Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih arrived in 
Damascus at 1230 today. 
  President Hafiz al-Asad led those who received President 
Salih on the tarmac. [passage omitted] The two presidents held 
a meeting at Tishrin Palace attended by the official Yemeni 
delegation, Vice Presidents 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam and Muhammad 
Zuhayr Mashariqah, Prime minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi. [passage 
omitted] 
  Upon arrival in Damascus, President Salih made a statement 
to 
the SYRIAN ARAB NEWS AGENCY, in which he said: I am glad to 
visit sisterly Syria to meet with my brother President Hafiz 
al-Asad and to discuss with him all issues that concern our two 
fraternal countries and our Arab nation at the present stage. 
For us, the visit will be an opportunity to acquaint brother 
President Hafiz al-Asad with developments and the situation in 
our country and efforts to overcome the political crisis and 
implement the accord document, signed in Amman, in order to 
maintain unity and build the modern Yemeni state. We in the 
Republic of Yemen cannot do without the role of the brothers in 
Syria, led by brother President Hafiz al-Asad. They have always 
been with us. They have always embodied the sincerity of the 
pan-Arab position toward their brothers in Yemen and have been 
eager to maintain Yemeni unity, which is a pan-Arab gain before 
being a Yemeni gain. Preserving this unity is an Arab 
responsibility, because it is an important factor for 
consolidating security, stability, and peace in the region. It 
is also an advanced step toward realizing the pan-Arab unionist 
objective that strengthens Arab power and meets Arab aspirations 
for progress. 
  Undoubtedly, our talks will deal with developments in the 
Arab arena and issues that concern our Arab nation, foremost of 
which are developments in the Palestine question and the 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. 
  We reiterate our country's position that supports the 
efforts, led by steadfast Syria, to realize a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region based on the restoration of 
Arab rights, foremost of which is the Palestinian Arab people's 
right to return to their land and set up their independent state 
on their national soil, and Israel's withdrawal from occupied 
Arab territory in the Golan and south Lebanon.

question and the efforts under way to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of regaining Arab

  [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Terrorism and the Peace 
Process," AL-BA'TH says: It has been officially confirmed that 
the Tel Aviv government and the occupation army are directly 
linked to the Hebron massacre. Consequently, the major world 
powers should have played the expected role in the face of the 
mass murder operations carried out by the occupation troops and 
the settlers, who are backed by the Tel Aviv government. 
  The paper adds: We expected decisive and serious measures to 
put an end to the policy of murder, terrorism, and forced 
expulsion that Israel is practicing against our people in the 
occupied territories. 
  The paper blames the world's big powers for not taking 
serious measures against the Israelis, who have continued to 
commit more massacres and terrorist acts. 
  The paper stresses that in order to see a successful end to 
the peace process and the achievment of its desired objectives, 
an end must be put to the Israeli disdain for international 
legitimacy and its resolutions. These resolutions should also 
be implemented, particularly those relating to the complete and 
comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories. 
  The paper stresses that peace will remain distant from the 
region as long as Arab territory remains occupied. 
  The paper concludes by saying: The facts of the conflict in 
the region should be dealt with in accordance with the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. Only in this way can 
peace be established and the region escape the state of tension 
that it has been living with for half a century.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Political observers throughout the world 
agree unanimously that Israel has, throughout the years of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, wasted several opportunities for a 
lasting and entrenched peace in the Middle East. These 
observers also agree unanimously that of all the international 
initiatives to end this conflict that has been raging for more 
than half a century, the U.S. initiative is the most serious. 
Despite this, Israel has not met its responsibilities to the 
peace issue. It has remained captive to its expansionist 
ambitions, hostile ideology, and greed for occupying land. It 
wasted two full years of the Washington talks in futile 
arguments on its security fears, and escalated acts of 
repression in the occupied Arab territories. It committed the 
brutal aggression against southern Lebanon on the pretext of 
these security claims, until it was exposed to the whole world 
by the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, where the Zionist 
settlers killed worshipers in God's house, and the Israeli Army 
completed the brutal massacre by killing other Palestinians who 
were leaving the mosque. 
  Inasmuch as the international community denounced the 
heinous 
massacre, it exerted efforts to save the peace process from an 
inevitable collapse. UN Security Council Resolution No. 904, 
although late, has come to contribute to the efforts aimed at 
resuming the Washington talks and at emerging with tangible 
results. Syria has responded to the various international 
endeavors out of its belief that the peace cosponsors are now 
aware of, more than at any time in the past, the seriousness of 
the Israeli maneuvering, and of the need for the actual 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions. Peace 
prospects have narrowed as a result of the Israeli rulers' 
procrastination and prevarications, and of giving predominance 
to unimportant things over essential and substantive issues. 
Although the UN Security Council has provided another 
opportunity to resume the peace process, Israel's wasting of 
this opportunity, just as past opportunities, could deal a fatal 
blow to the U.S. initiative, after which its revival would be 
difficult. 
  Undoubtedly, Israel's actions in southern Lebanon and the 
occupied Arab territories, in addition to its procrastination 
and prevarications, threaten the peace process. Israel's rulers 
violate human rights, the Geneva conventions, and the UN 
principles on a daily basis. Israel has been occupying the Arab 
territories since 1967, confiscating the possessions of the Arab 
citizens, establishing settlements, and dealing with the 
Palestinian people very brutally. It does not hesitate to kill 
children and women. It also confronts the Lebanese people's 
struggle to liberate their land with raids, shelling, and 
bombardment from land, air, and sea. Had Israel been concerned 
about achieving peace, as its rulers claim, It would have 
managed to render the Washington talks a success, and announced 
its readiness to fully withdraw from the occupied Arab 
territories, to implement the UN Security Council resolutions, 
and achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
What draws one attention is that the Israeli rulers have been 
shedding tears on the threatened peace since the Hebron 
massacre. They have not stop making calls to resume the talks. 
Have they eventually been convinced that the policy of 
maneuvering and intransigence, which they have been adopting 
since the convening of the Madrid conference, will not be able 
to affect the determination of Syria and the Arabs to restore 
their occupied territories in full, and that peace cannot be 
established through separate deals, but through the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions, as well 
as through full abidance by the essence and bases of the U.S. 
initiative; namely, the exchange of land for peace? 
  Only a few days ago, Yitzhaq Rabin admitted that there is 
not 
much time left, and that Israel must make decisions. However, 
as usual, he did not explain the nature of these decisions. We 
have no choice but to remind him that the decision awaited by 
the whole world, without which there will be no solution or 
peace in the Middle East, is the full Israeli withdrawal. The 
Arabs have done everything possible to render the peace process 
a success. Syria played a distinguished role in reactivating 
the peace process, a role recognized by the international 
community. Based on this, Israel alone will be responsible for 
wasting the new opportunity provided by the UN Security Council 
resolution, and by the international efforts that have been 
persistent since the Hebron massacre, if it continues with the 
policy of maneuvering and prevarication, and believes that it 
can continue to disdain the power of the UN Security Council and 
human mind.

  [Excerpt] Damascus -- AL-THAWRAH -- Statistics from the 
Planning Directorate at the Ministry of Tourism have confirmed 
that the number of tourists who came to Syria in 1993 reached 
1.91 million; an increase of 10 percent over 1992 when the 
number of tourists reached 1.74 million. 
  A spokesman for the directorate said the number of tourists 
this year is expected to exceed two million, judging by the 
current figures, which is considered a positive indicator of the 
development of Syrian tourism. 
  The spokesman added that facilities given to all visitors in 
the form of simplified entry and exit procedures and greater 
latitude in bringing in and taking out currencies, have played a 
major role in increasing the number of tourists, especially Arab 
tourists whose number reached 1.42 million. Arab tourists are 
given the same treatment as Syrians since they do not require 
entry visas, as in the case of foreign nationals, and they also 
enjoy the right of residence and ownership. 
  The spokesman added that proper preparations for the tourist 
season have also had a great effect. The Ministry of Tourism, 
in cooperation with the competent quarters, has made up for all 
shortages and has met the needs of tourists and visitors of all 
nationalities. The number of beds in Syrian hotels now exceeds 
30,000. This is in addition to 8,000 beds in summer camps 
catering to internal tourism, and 20,000 beds in villas and 
furnished apartments. 
  The spokesman said that, due to its richness in beauty and 
history, Syria has become a great tourist resort and a vast 
museum visited by people from all over the world. There has 
also been progress in all aspects of life. In addition to the 
improvement in the hotel industry, Syria has been active in 
other fields as well. Its 24,000-km road network includes 783 km 
of highway and 2,000 km of modern railroad. Its airports and 
seaports are provided with tourist lounges. This is in addition 
to a large fleet of tourist transport buses. Law No. 10 of 1991 
has encouraged many financiers to establish new tourist 
transport companies. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunisia, which is committed to press and media 
freedom being one of the foundations of democracy, indeed agrees 
with what a French Foreign Ministry spokesman has said about 
eagerness to respect this freedom. However, it cannot accept 
that some media sources allow themselves, in the name of this 
freedom, to commit all sorts of excesses and fail to observe the 
ethics required by this freedom. 
  This is stressed by a responsible source in the Foreign 
Ministry in the wake of the 22 March statements by a French 
Foreign Ministry spokesman regarding the Tunisian authorities' 
decision to ban the distribution of LE MONDE newspaper in 
Tunisia. 
  The source added that Tunisia adopted this measure with 
great 
regret against a newspaper published in a friendly country. 
However, Tunisia did not just want to express this regret, but 
also to highlight and condemn what cannot be ignored, which is 
this newspaper continuing its hostile and slanderous stance 
toward a country that is known for its tolerance, and whose 
media landscape remains among the most open landscapes. It is 
also the country to which neutral observers certify great 
achievements in all sectors. 
  The same source adds that these infringements on a sovereign 
country's dignity and this repeated failure to observe the rules 
and ethics of the trade are matters that are unacceptable in 
nature. He recalled that LE MONDE did not content itself by 
spreading wrong or totally distorted news and commentaries 
filled with false accusations, but, contrary to common practice, 
it also often refused Tunisia the right of reply.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman--A group of prominent businessmen on Wednesday 
[23 March] officially launched a $200 million holding company to 
invest in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Kamal 
al-Sha'ir, a Jordanian businessman, was elected chairman of the 
company's 16- member board of directors. 
  The Palestine Development and Investment Incorporated (PDII) 
is the first major Arab-led commercial enterprise to be launched 
since the Sept. 13 signing of the autonomy accord between Israel 
and the PLO. 
  "This is a historic day for the economic and developmental 
future of the occupied territories," said Ahmad Quray', head of 
the Economic Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO), addressing the audience at a ceremony launching PDII at 
the Amman Chamber of Industry. 
  The ceremony, followed by the election of the board of 
directors, was attended by many of the 141 investors who 
constitute the financial backbone of much of the Palestinian 
community in the diaspora. They include Arab Bank Chairman 
'Abd-al-Hamid Shuman, Hasib al-Sabbagh, Sa'id Khuri, Munib 
al-Masri, Ramzi Dallul, and 'Abd-al-Muhsin Qattan. 
  Several leaders of the Jordanian business community such as 
Khalil al-Talhuni, Kamal al-Sha'ir, and Khaldun Abu-Hassan and 
Jordanian banks such as the Cairo Amman Bank and the Housing 
Bank are also founding members of the PDII. 
  The opening was attended by Minister of Information Jawad 
al-'Anani and Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim as well as Jerusalem-based Palestinian leader and 
leading peace negotiator Faysal al-Husayni. 
  "We, in the occupied territories, welcome the venture with 
open arms," Mr. Husayni told the press. He stressed that in 
view of the economic difficulties and restraints faced by the 
people in the occupied territories, "all help is welcome." 
  Mr. Quray', one of the Palestinian architects behind the 
Oslo 
peace accord, said: "Our information indicates that at least 50 
per cent of the people in the occupied territories are 
unemployed; investment in housing and industries will change 
that." 
  "We have estimated that we need to build 185,000 housing 
units in the occupied territories," he added. 
  The founding members, who have thus far contributed just 
over 
half of the capital, or $100 million, say they hope to raise 
another $100 million. 
  "In another six to eight months the number of founding 
investors could reach up to 300 or more and the capital 
investment would grow to $200 million," said company spokesman 
Raja'i al-Masri. 
  "This is the first major initiative of its kind by the 
Palestinian private sector in the economic development of the 
occupied territories," said Mr. Quray'. 
  The company was registered in Liberia as an off-shore 
share-holding firm in October 1993, and it will retain that 
status until the political and economic situation in the 
occupied territories becomes "more settled," Mr. al-Masri said. 
  It was also announced at Wednesday's meeting that the PDII 
was a 49 per cent share-holder in the West Bank-based al-Ruwad 
Investment Group, which is a West Bank-registered share-holding 
company with an initial capital of $50 million. 
  Al-Ruwad will act as PDII's largest subsidiary in the 
occupied territories, said Kamal Hassuni, a West Bank investor 
in PDII and director of Al-Ruwad. 
  "West Bank and Gaza investors have 51 per cent of the shares 
and our first priority is to build badly needed housing units," 
Mr. Hassuni said. 
  PDII will initially concentrate on housing, industry, light 
industry and the tourism. 
  The ownership composition is in accordance with Jordanian 
laws implemented before the 1967 Israeli seizure of the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip. "Local residents must have the 
majority of the shares," said Raja Shihadah, a prominent 
Ramallah-based lawyer, who also addressed the audience and 
briefed investors on the legal aspects of investment in the 
occupied territories. 
  Company shares will be made available to the public once 
PDII 
is listed at a stock market. "We don't expect that a 
Palestinian stock market will develop in the very near future 
but the PDII stocks will undoubtedly be listed in the stock 
markets of Arab capitals such as Amman, Beirut and Bahrain," 
said one of the founders of the company. 
  The members of the board are: The Arab Bank Ltd, the 
Cairo-Amman Bank (Yazid Mufti), Said Co., al-Masirah Co., Nabil 
al-Shawwa, Ramzi Dallul, 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi, Nidal Sukhtyan, 
Riad Sadiq, Husayn Sharqawi, Zuhdi Khury and the Housing Bank.

<F P=106> [Commentary by editor in chief Bashir al-Barghuthi: "The </F>
Road to Oslo Is No Longer Passable"] 
  [Excerpts] Without having to go as far back as the Madrid 
days, after the Oslo and Cairo agreements we now have a great 
deal of painful evidence that the negotiations "mechanism" which 
the United States assured us would lead to a just solution has 
only yielded more retreats politically and on the ground, to the 
disadvantage of the Palestinian side, in the conflict's equation. 
  Suffice it that we point to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
and the subsequent decision to set up a new settlement 
neighborhood in holy Jerusalem, then to the United States' 
abstention from the Security Council vote on the status of 
Jerusalem, and to what is happening now in Hebron -- from the 
destruction of buildings by rockets to the endless falling of 
martyrs by official bullets! 
  Undoubtedly, the decisionmakers in the Palestinian 
negotiating side have heard about all these things, but that did 
not prevent them from agreeing to resume the talks and accepting 
to play the game of "technical" details, without drawing the 
appropriate conclusions about the meaning of the continuing 
Hebron massacre and about the U.S. position on Security Council 
Resolution 904. [passage omitted] 
  Amid this amazing urge to negotiate, without taking into 
account the bloody developments in the occupied Palestinian 
territories and without paying attention to the calls by the 
majority of the territories' residents to stop the talks until 
the conditions for the Palestinian people's protection are met, 
the PLO's leadership crisis is intensifying. Half of the 
Executive Committee members did not attend its recent meetings. 
The half that did attend were not harmonious. Negotiating 
decisions are adopted even before those members are informed 
about them. The Israeli and U.S. sides are aware of this fact. 
They are also aware that among the nine members attending the 
current Executive Committee meetings, three did not agree to the 
Oslo accord. In addition, other members are opposed to the way 
in which decisions -- if they are decisions -- are being adopted 
by the Executive Committee. 
  This situation must not continue. It undermines the PLO's 
status as the Palestinian people's sole legitimate 
representative and has a negative effect on its credibility as a 
negotiator on behalf of these people as well as on its 
negotiating power. 
  Once again we call on all those concerned about the PLO's 
status and credibility to meet and consult in a bid to assess 
the situation and agree on measures that at least ensure the 
minimal national unity. 
  The Oslo road is no longer passable. It is full of 
settlements and calamities that have befallen our people through 
the long lists of martyrs, confiscations of land, and daily 
violations. It is no longer possible to jump over what has 
accumulated on the Oslo road. If anyone is thinking of doing so, 
it will be a dangerous jump and his fall will be so hard that we 
would not wish it on any of our people.

  [Text] With regard to the latest developments in the Cairo 
talks, I would like to say that the Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations resumed a short while ago. 
  Prior to the resumption of the negotiations a short while 
ago, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th said 
agreement has been reached on the deployment of joint 
Palestinian-Israeli police patrols in the Hebron area. He said 
agreement has also been reached on the weapons that will be 
carried by the international observer force. These weapons, he 
noted, will be individual weapons to be used for only 
self-defense. 
  As we have said, the negotiations have been resumed. This is 
the only new development I know of. We will announce any 
further developments once they occur.

  [Text] Brother Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the peace talks currently under way in Cairo, has 
hoped that it will be possible to reach an agreement with Israel 
on security for Palestinians in the occupied territories, 
particularly in the city of Hebron. 
  In statements at the end of the first session of talks with 
Israeli negotiators, which lasted [words indistinct] hours last 
night, brother Nabil Sha'th said the negotiations are proceeding 
well, and that they are not encountering any difficulties. He 
hoped that an agreement will be reached today to allow for the 
resumption of the talks on the implementation of the Palestinian 
autonomy agreement.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--Terry Larsen, Norwegian deputy 
foreign minister and chairman of a conference on providing 
material aid for the Palestinian police force, has stated that 
it has been decided to form a committee of representatives from 
the PLO, Israel, the United States, Egypt, Japan, Russia, 
Norway, and the European Union to discuss the mechanism for 
providing aid for the Palestinian police force, which will be 
formed in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles. 
  Larsen stated this in a joint news conference today attended 
by Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace 
talks; Victor Posuvalyuk, President Yeltsin's envoy to the 
Middle East; Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation; Uri Savir, director general of the Israeli Foreign 
Ministry; and Ambassador Husayn Dirar from the Egyptian Foreign 
Ministry. The committee held its first meeting after the news 
conference. 
  Larsen said the Israelis and Palestinians agreed on the 
entry 
of the police force to the autonomous regions and that the 
international community must support this force. 
  Dennis Ross said the United States will send 200 vehicles 
for 
the police force within two weeks. 
  Sha'th said the World Bank has estimated how much money the 
police force will need. An initial sum of $47 million is needed 
for the force. The final cost will be around $90 million 
annually. He noted that part of this cost can be met in the 
form of material aid. Some donor states have actually promised 
to give this aid. 
  Larsen said the amount to be given by the donor states has 
not been decided yet. He noted that envoys from the PLO and 
Norway will visit the donor states to urge them to give aid soon. 
  At the start of the news conference, Larsen delivered a 
statement saying that Norway called for this urgent session 
after consulting with the parties concerned with the peace 
process to coordinate the aid to be given to establish the 
Palestinian police force in accordance with the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and after Israel 
and the PLO agreed on the early entry of the Palestinian police 
force to safeguard the safety and security of the Palestinians 
in the occupied territories. 
  Larsen explained that the Israeli and Palestinian sides have 
affirmed their commitment to the peace process and have 
discussed the progress made regarding the formation of the 
police force. The Palestinian side has also discussed the 
force's needs in terms of equipment, telecommunications, 
clothes, and housing. The donor states also told the meeting 
what they can give to the Palestinian police force. He said 
that during the meeting, emphasis was placed on the quick 
handing over of missions to the Palestinian police. The PLO 
explained the need for the right coordination and mechanism in 
handing over such missions. 
  Asked about the funds allocated for the Palestinian police 
force, Larsen said he cannot state the amounts before 
delegations from Norway and the PLO visit the donor states. 
  Asked about the date of the deployment of the Palestinian 
force in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said: We are discussing 
preparations for the deployment of the Palestinian force as soon 
as possible. He said he hoped deployment would take place on 
the date specified in the Declaration of Principles--13 April. 
He also said he hoped a Palestinian force would be dispatched 
earlier to prepare for the self-rule authority in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Sha'th said a Palestinian police force will deploy in Hebron 
but this will be outside the framework of the Gaza-Jericho 
talks. Agreement on this police force for Hebron will be reached 
within the framework of the current talks in Cairo. 
  Asked about the armament of the Palestinian police force in 
Hebron, Sha'th said the police will carry personal weapons. He 
said no agreement has been reached on heavy weapons, such as 
machine guns. So we ask the donor states to finance what was 
agreed upon -- light weapons, houses for the police force, 
telecommunications equipment, and transport vehicles. He noted 
that Norway has delivered 3,000 police uniforms and promised to 
send another 7,000 uniforms soon. 
  Uri Savir, director of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said: 
During the previous talks on Gaza and Jericho we were very close 
to reaching an agreement on the arrangements for the police 
force. We must now reach agreement on the police force outside 
Gaza and Jericho. He said: We discussed the gradual arrival of 
the Palestinian police force before the handover of the 
self-rule authority in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Larsen declined to answer a question on the absence of Saudi 
Arabia and Kuwait from the meeting. 
  Asked about the deployment of a Palestinian police force in 
Hebron, Sha'th said this was the result of the ugly massacre in 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that negotiations are under 
way with the Israeli side on the size of this force. 
  Commenting on the same issue, Savir said: We are still 
discussing the issue of the police force in Hebron. In the 
event of an agreement, this force will be a step on the road 
toward achieving security and stability for the Palestinians. 
There are some details that are still under discussion. 
  Asked about his tour of the region, Dennis Ross said his 
talks with the parties concerned with the peace process were 
good. The parties affirmed their commitment to establishing a 
just and comprehensive peace in the region. He noted that the 
meeting in Cairo today indicates that the Israelis want to 
establish an atmosphere of confidence. 
  Dennis Ross said: I can say now that April will be the date 
for resuming the Palestinian-Israeli talks. He noted that he is 
holding talks with the Russian side on resuming these talks. 
  On the Russian role in the region, President Yeltsin's envoy 
said: We have reasons for our increasing interest in the Middle 
East. The region is our neighbor. We are interested in 
establishing strong relations with it. We have important 
economic interests in the region. Many Soviet Jews have 
emigrated to Israel. He stressed that his country will take 
steps to strengthen its relations with the Arab states. 
  The Palestinian and Israeli sides expressed their gratitude 
to Egypt and Norway for helping them convene this meeting 
despite the short notice. They also thanked the cosponsors of 
the conference, the United States and Russia, whose 
participation on this high level is significant for all the 
sides.

  [Text] Cairo, 24 Mar (MENA)--Informed Palestinian sources 
have said that the current Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo to 
implement the latest Security Council resolution on the 
protection of the Palestinians in the occupied territories have 
progressed. 
  The sources told MENA that the Palestinian-Israeli 
subcommittee working to draft an agreement on the international 
presence in Hebron, the Palestinian police force that will 
deploy in the city, and the armament and jurisdiction of this 
force has made progress and that the two sides are expected to 
reach an agreement in the next few hours. 
  The sources added that the agreement will be tantamount to 
an 
"integrated package" that should be accepted or rejected as a 
whole. The decision on whether to resume the talks on self-rule 
in Gaza and Jericho will depend on this package. 
  The Palestinian sources said the agreement the subcommittee 
is working on drafting will take into consideration the 
Palestinian demands to move 42 Israeli families living in Hebron 
city in the Qiryat Arba' settlement outside the city, because 
their presence in Hebron causes tension. 
  The agreement also provides for instituting joint patrols of 
Palestinian and Israeli police in Hebron to maintain security 
and protect the Palestinians there. 
  The Palestinian sources believe the latest developments in 
Hebron city over the past 48 hours assert beyond any doubt the 
importance of adopting security measures to protect the 
Palestinian population in the city in light of its unique 
situation with Islamic holy places there. 
  The Palestinian sources stated that Israel has agreed to 
international protection for the Palestinians through 
international observers armed with light weapons. This is a 
Norwegian proposal agreed upon by the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides as a substitute for an Israeli proposal suggesting unarmed 
international observers from the International Red Cross and 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency personnel in the occupied 
territories. 
  The sources noted that the Israeli Cabinet accepts the 
Security Council resolution calling for international protection 
for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, 
especially in Hebron city.

  [Text] Progress was made last night in the Cairo talks 
between Israeli and Palestinian representatives on security 
arrangements in Hebron. Agreement was reached on the resumption 
of the Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday, and progress was made on 
most of the issues on the agenda. The Cairo talks ended last 
night and the Israeli delegation is now on its way home. It 
will report to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at noon. Our 
political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from our Tel Aviv 
studio: 
  A short time ago, an Israeli source very involved in the 
Cairo talks, told us that a breakthrough or at last progress was 
made in Egypt, which will permit the resumption of the 
Gaza-Jericho talks next Tuesday. Progress was made on issues 
which can be grouped under the term Palestinian security 
problems, which surfaced due to the Hebron massacre, especially 
on the establishment and deployment of a Palestinian police 
force in Hebron. The force will be linked to the Palestinian 
police force to be set up in Gaza and Jericho whose 
establishment has already been agreed on. It will be associated 
in some way with the Hebron Municipality, but will be 
operationally subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. 
That was the main problem under discussion this past week and 
once it has been resolved, the talks can now focus on the 
resumption of the Gaza-Jericho talks. The police force will be 
made up of several dozen Palestinian policemen, which as far as 
is known, will be armed with revolvers for self-defense. They 
will conduct joint patrols with the IDF and the foreign 
observers Israel is prepared to have deployed in Hebron. 
  The prime minister said yesterday that the talks between 
Israel and Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan will resume in late April, 
unrelated to the talks with the PLO. We can therefore state 
that the peace talks are making a great stride forward along all 
tracks.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Mar (MENA)--An Israeli delegation led by 
Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq left Cairo this morning, 
having taken part in the negotiations aiming to implement UN 
Security Council Resolution 904 concerning the massacre in 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque. 
  The delegation held two days of talks in Cairo with a 
Palestinian delegation led by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, on ways of 
implementing Resolution 904, particularly with regard to 
providing international protection to the Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. 
  A small Palestinian-Israeli drafting committee held a long 
session last night to formulate a comprehensive agreement on 
international protection arrangements in Hebron and the 
Palestinian police force in the city. 
  An agreement between the two sides would open the way to 
resuming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations aimed at implementing 
the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement. The negotiations were 
discontinued on 25 February following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre.

  [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Palestinian 
negotiating team, has said that progress was achieved in the 
talks but added that some issues remain unresolved. Speaking to 
journalists following a session of talks that ended early this 
morning in Cairo, Sha'th said the talks would resume on Tuesday 
[29 Mar] following consultations by the two delegations in 
Tunisia and Israel. 
  General Amnon Shahaq, who heads the Israeli delegation to 
the 
talks, speaking following a 14-hour session of talks, said a 
joint document was formulated but there are still several points 
of disagreement. 
  PLO sources last night said that Israel agreed in principle 
to a limited presence of international observers and the 
operation of joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols in Hebron. 
  [In a related report, Cairo MENA in Arabic at 0755 GMT on 25 
March cites Dr. Sha'th as saying: "Considerable progress took 
place in the negotiations with the Israelis over the past two 
days in Cairo but there are still some points that need to be 
worked out." 
  [The same MENA report adds: "Sources close to the 
negotiations say that Israel has agreed to the deployment of 100 
Norwegian observers armed with light weapons in Hebron."]

  [Text] Viktor Posuvalyuk, the special Russian envoy who is 
currently in Cairo, told Qol Yisra'el that the Egyptians view 
Russia's new spate of activity with great enthusiasm and have 
emphasized Russia's role as an international superpower. Our 
correspondent Izabella Ginor, who interviewed Posuvalyuk from 
our studio, asked him about the results of his many meetings 
with 'Arafat. 
  The Russian envoy said he conveyed to 'Arafat a letter from 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev which underscored the need to 
pursue the talks and meet the commitment which the peace process 
imposes on us. At the same time the letter underlined Russia's 
commitment as a permanent member of the Security Council and a 
superpower. 
  Posuvalyuk went on to say that as a superpower, Russia will 
do everything within its power to implement the Security Council 
resolution. This is what he spoke about with 'Arafat, as well 
as about concrete issues such as 'Arafat's upcoming visit to 
Moscow on 19 April. 
  Ginor asked Posuvalyuk whether after five meetings with 
'Arafat in Tunis, and as a special Russian envoy to the Middle 
East, he intends to visit Jerusalem as well. The Russian said 
that five days ago he met Israel's ambassador to Moscow and 
later Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir in Tunis. 
Posuvalyuk told his Israeli interlocutors in no uncertain terms 
that he wants to come to Israel soon in order to hold in-depth 
talks about bilateral relations and Russia's intended role in 
the Middle East. Posuvalyuk said he received favorable 
reactions to his request and the only question remains that of 
timing, seeing that Israel is on the eve of a holiday. He 
stated, however, that he would like to come to Israel as soon as 
possible. 
  The Russian envoy stressed Russia's expected role in the 
area. He said Russia wants to play a quiet, constructive, and 
creative role. Asked by Ginor whether his many meetings with 
'Arafat do not indicate that Russia is coordinating its moves 
with the PLO, Posuvalyuk was actually offended, saying it was a 
rude question. He said that the PLO was an independent party to 
the peace process and that Russia is one of the cosponsors of 
the process. It is not a matter of coordination, rather of 
reciprocal relations and a certain overlapping of aims and 
practical missions. 
  Ginor asked Posuvalyuk if he solved with 'Arafat the issue 
of 
the international presence, which caused so many difficulties on 
the path to resuming the talks. The Russian answered that the 
issue was in principle dealt with in the Security Council 
resolution and is now being discussed by all the sides. We will 
have to find the optimal formula from among the many ideas 
introduced. Posuvalyuk said in his opinion a compromise will be 
found in the form of some kind of international observers. The 
special Russian envoy believes these will be UN observers with a 
finely-nuanced status and political equipment -- and other 
equipment as well. Posuvalyuk emphasized that Russia is in 
principle very interested in participating in this international 
presence, whatever form it finally takes. 
  We asked the Russian envoy about the possibility of a 
meeting 
between Yasir 'Arafat and Yitzhaq Rabin -- who is scheduled to 
visit Moscow several days after 'Arafat. Posuvalyuk claimed 
that so far there is no such meeting on the agenda. 
Hypothetically, however, a summit between Rabin and 'Arafat -- 
in Moscow or elsewhere -- could directly contribute to the 
success of the peace process.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
moderator Hayim Zissowitz and political correspondent Shlomo 
Raz; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Zissowitz] Good morning Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres. Can you tell us more about the arrangements reached in 
Cairo last night? 
  [Peres] No, I prefer reporting about things that have been 
finalized, and that has not yet been finalized. Important 
progress has been made though. 
  [Zissowitz] What points are still left open? 
  [Peres] There is unfinished business on both issues 
discussed. 
  [Zissowitz] Including the issue of the Palestinian police 
force? 
  [Peres] Yes, there are problems of numbers and powers, but I 
do not want to go into that because it only increases the gaps 
while negotiations are still in progress. But the very fact 
that the negotiations are back on track and progress can be made 
on them is the most important thing that took place in Cairo. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, I would like to ask you about the 
Palestinian police. Although things have not yet been 
finalized, how will it be possible to maintain security there 
since so many elements are involved? 
  [Peres] There might be many elements, but there will be one 
element responsible for all decisions dealing with opening fire. 
There will be no negotiations during an operation. 
  [Raz] What will happen for instance if the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] has an operation against a Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] squad, as was the case this week, and the 
Palestinian police force is deployed between the IDF and the 
structure in which the terrorists are holed up? 
  [Peres] We continue to have overall responsibility for 
security in the territories. We will not and cannot free 
ourselves of that responsibility. The State of Israel will 
continue to be responsible for the lives of all the people and 
will act against those who endanger lives, whether of Jews or 
Arabs. 
  [Zissowitz] Is it clear to whom the armed Palestinian police 
will be subordinate? 
  [Peres] I do not want to go into that, but it is clear that 
they will be subordinate to a single authority. 
  [Zissowitz] On which issue has Israel given in to the 
Palestinians in the talks? 
  [Peres] The problem is not of giving in. Israel faced a new 
situation. Let us discuss the real problem. A monster 
surrounded by wild weeds appeared among us, something that does 
not have easy solutions. We must find solutions to situations 
we did not ask for and we are also dealing with the 
sensitivities of the residents. It is not a symmetric situation 
whereby there is a Arab state facing an Israeli state and a 
Palestinian police force facing an Israeli police force. There 
is a single state responsible for security, and an issue which 
starts with peoples' sensitivities. Before you see a knife you 
have to consider what is motivating it, before you look at a 
rifle you have to consider what causes somebody to pull the 
trigger. We must deal with all that in a responsible way. We 
are not in some circus where you check the trapeze every day to 
see how far you are jumping. We are a very responsible and 
determined government. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, will the Palestinian police in Hebron 
impose its powers on the Jewish settlers? 
  [Peres] It will not deal with that at all. We are not in 
favor of mixing powers, but I do not want to go in to all those 
details; it is too early. Only when the negotiations are 
completed will we be able to make public all the details. We 
are aware of the subjects you have raised. We do not want to 
bring about friction and clashes; on the contrary, we want to 
reduce friction and prevent clashes, we want to assure security. 
  [Zissowitz] Have the Palestinians withdrawn their demand to 
evacuate the Jewish settlers from the heart of Hebron? 
  [Peres] They never presented it as an ultimatum. When they 
raised the issue, even though not as an ultimatum, we told them 
unequivocally that the issue of settlers, settlements, and 
population dispersal are Israel's sole responsibility and we 
will not agree to any change because of pressures or 
negotiations. In the negotiations themselves we agreed that all 
the settlements can remain intact. 
  [Zissowitz] At least for the time being, will the Jewish 
settlers remain where they are? 
  [Peres] I do not know what for the time being means. It is 
hard to constantly operate with a stopwatch and count the hours. 
  [Zissowitz] I would like to know whether the demand to 
evacuate the settlers has been removed from the agenda? 
  [Peres] It does not depend on the Palestinians at all, it is 
a decision Israel must make in a responsible way and on its own. 
I have nothing to say about proposals or intentions. A 
government does not have to make public proposals and intentions 
on a daily basis. When it decides to make a decision it does so. 
  [Raz] Mr. Peres, on Tuesday the Gaza-Jericho talks resume 
and that is in fact the main issue in the negotiations. 
  [Peres] That is correct. 
  [Raz] How long will that phase take and when will the new 
deployment on the ground -- the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho 
-- start? 
  [Peres] There is no doubt that there will be speedy 
negotiations. All the committees, including the economic 
committee, will convene in Cairo in order to coordinate and 
speed up the negotiations. There are differences of opinion. 
There are those who say it will take two weeks and there are 
those who say it will take three weeks. What I can say with 
certainty is that all the sides, definitely our side, will 
contribute everything needed to speed up the process. 
  [Zissowitz] The talks with the Palestinians will continue in 
Cairo and not Washington? 
  [Peres] Two different things have to be made clear. The 
Gaza-Jericho negotiations will be held in Cairo. The 
negotiations on the autonomy will continue in Washington, as has 
been the case up to now. We are, in fact, talking about two 
different processes.

  [Text] Major General Sha'ul Mufaz, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] forces in Judaea and Samaria, said this 
evening that the three terrorists killed by the security forces 
in Hebron belonged to one of the most prominent terror squads in 
the territories. Maj. Gen. Mufaz told correspondents that so 
far three bodies were found in the building in which the 
terrorists barricaded themselves. Mufaz says these terrorists 
were involved in a long series of attacks, including the murder 
of Mordekhay and Shalom Lapid in Hebron, and the murder of 
Avraham Zarbiv near the Cave of the Patriarchs. 
  Maj. Gen. Mufaz said that following the operation in Hebron 
only 10 Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad 
terrorists remain operating in Judaea and Samaria. Mufaz added 
that the Hebron operation was made possible by strenuous Shin 
Bet efforts. According to Mufaz the house in which the 
terrorists hid served as a storehouse and a launch pad for Hamas 
terror acts.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Rina Matzliah] </F>
  [Text] There were violent incidents in all the cities of 
the territories following the battle in Hebron yesterday. 
Dozens of Palestinians were injured and the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] clamped a curfew on Nabulus and its environs. A general 
commercial strike was declared in the territories. Our 
correspondent Rina Matzliah sums up today's incidents: 
  The territories resembled today the early days of the 
intifadah. Serious stone-throwing incidents occurred downtown 
Nabulus today. The IDF unsuccessfully tried to disperse the 
rioters with tear gas. Approximately 17 Nabulus youths were 
wounded by IDF gunfire. A border policeman was slightly 
wounded. The IDF imposed a curfew on the city and nearby 
refugee camps. 
  There were also disturbances in Ramallah and al-Duhayshah 
today. Sixteen youths were wounded by IDF gunfire in the 
Jabalyah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. Another four were 
wounded in the al-Burayj and al-Nusayrat refugee camps. The 
youths are at the vanguard of today's violent confrontation, 
which is depicted as a struggle of solidarity with the residents 
of Hebron.

<F P=106> [Renee-Anne Gutter report: "Soldiers Attack Belgian UN </F>
Official"] 
  [Excerpts] Jerusalem -- If Israel wishes to convince the 
PLO that unarmed foreign observers will suffice to ensure the 
protection of the Palestinians and their own security, it will 
have to go about it in a different way. Indeed, while the Rabin 
government is in the middle of negotiations with the PLO on a 
possible international presence in the occupied territories, the 
Israeli Army launched a particularly brutal attack on observers 
already on the spot, in this case a Belgian woman, An Mertens, 
from Scherpenheuvel who has been working on the West Bank since 
September 1992 for the UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency] as a refugee affairs officer. [passage omitted] 
  Israel has never officially recognized the refugee affairs 
officers but tolerates them and generally allows them to travel 
round without too many hindrances. Until last Tuesday. On a 
routine mission with her Palestinian assistant in the Tulkarm 
region of the West Bank, An Mertens saw soldiers in the 
Nur-al-Shams refugee camp "beating up" two young Palestinian 
children, and a television crew arriving on the scene. Trying 
to calm down one of the soldiers, she was suddenly thrown to the 
ground, her hands bound by plastic handcuffs, dragged to the 
camp exit, and left for several minutes, forced to remain 
kneeling, her head down, with the tight handcuffs cutting into 
her skin. Shortly afterwards her assistant suffered the same 
fate. 
  The two were finally released without any other proceedings 
but are still finding it difficult to recover from their bruises 
and shock. [passage omitted] 
  Was this excessive zeal on the part of a local junior 
officer? Is it general nervousness on the part of the Army in 
the wake of the Hebron massacre? At all events, the UNRWA 
intends to inform UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and make a 
complaint against Israel.

<F P=106> [Report by defense affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Text] Several states which have defense ties with Israel 
have asked to "lower the profile" of these relations after the 
Cave of the Patriarchs' massacre, for both diplomatic and 
internal political reasons, a senior military source said 
yesterday. 
  This led to a slow down in contacts to complete deals for 
Israeli military hardware and to second thoughts by 
representatives of foreign governments about going ahead with 
visits to Israel. 
  French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, who completed a 
visit to Israel 10 days ago, dispatched a special envoy to 
Israel several days prior to his arrival to study the situation 
in the wake of the Hebron massacre. 
  Sources close to the French Defense Ministry reported that 
the French Government -- which maintains close political and 
defense ties with the Arab states -- found itself in an 
uncomfortable position due to the timing of the visit so soon 
after the massacre. 
  The political situation following the massacre also 
influences ties with Muslim Turkey, which recently enhanced its 
defense ties with Israel. Following President 'Ezer Weizman's 
visit to Turkey in January, Israeli military firms are 
participating in tenders to refurbish Phantom and F-15 aircraft 
for the Turkish Air Force. 
  Since the visit, which helped to formalize the defense ties 
between the two countries, the contacts have continued at 
various working levels but no large deals have yet been 
finalized. The Turks nevertheless agreed to Israel deploying a 
military attache at its embassy in Turkey and he will arrive 
there in several weeks. Defense sources, however, believe the 
move is inadvisable. Turkey is on the eve of municipal 
elections, which will indicate the strength of the ruling 
parties. According to public opinion polls, the present 
government will not gain significant support in these elections. 
If that is the case, this government might be forced to resign 
and be replaced by a new government with which Israel will have 
to start new negotiations. 
  Germany is another country which recently asked to moderate 
its overt defense ties with Israel for political and diplomatic 
reasons. 
  The Germans recently cut their defense budget significantly 
in the wake of the union with the East and diverted financial 
resources for internal needs, a move which harmed military 
purchases from Israel, mainly of ammunition from the Israel 
Military Industries. 
  According to evaluations by defense sources, Germany will 
complete its reunification process next year when its internal 
situation will start to improve. If that happens, the sources 
believe, new procurement budgets will be presented and an 
improvement in trade ties with Israel will be felt.

  [Text] Israel's chief rabbis differ over the question of 
evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron. Ashkenazi Rabbi 
Yisra'el Lau opposes their evacuation, while Sephardic Rabbi 
Baqshi Doron believes that the duty to save lives overrides the 
biblical duty to maintain a Jewish settlement in Hebron. 
  Our correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld reports that interviews 
with the two rabbis will appear in tomorrow's edition of the 
ultra-Orthodox paper YOM HASHISHI. 
  Rabbi Lau goes on to say in the interview that even if 
politicians and the military rule that the Palestinians should 
be given self-rule, this should be done in a way so as not to 
undermine our right over Eretz Yisra'el. 
  Both rabbis lash out at the Religious Affairs Ministry 
which, 
as they see it, impinges on the authority of the Chief Rabbinate.

<F P=106> [Report by Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Text] Some 60 percent of Israelis support continuing the 
negotiations with the PLO, according to Professor Asher Ariane 
of Tel Aviv University's Center for Strategic Research. 
  The research is based on analysis of polls conducted between 
1984 and 1994. 
  Seventy-one percent support autonomy in the territories, 
while 31 percent support the establishment of a Palestinian 
state. Support for the Oslo accord is declining but a majority 
still support it. 
  Only six percent believe that the government is dealing 
properly with the country's problems. Some 34 percent said that 
the government is dealing with the issues satisfactorily, while 
61 percent are dissatisfied with its handling of the situation. 
  Thirty-two percent believe that most Arabs aspire to 
annihilate Israel and kill all the Jews. Twenty-three percent 
believe that the Arabs "only want to conquer Israel." 
Thirty-three percent believe that the Arabs want "to get back 
the lands they lost in 1967." 
  On the Oslo agreement: 36 percent support a Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, 25 percent "are not sure about the agreement," and 32 
percent "oppose the agreement." Support for the agreement under 
the latest poll is lower than in the December 1993 poll when 48 
percent backed it. 
  Those interviewed think the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has 
been weakened over the years, but that if the peace negotiations 
succeed it will be able to regain its power. 
  Eighty-four percent believe the Gaza Strip should be 
returned. Ten percent are ready to return East Jerusalem. On 
the settlements: a third supports them, a quarter opposes them, 
and the remainder are ready to support them for security reasons. 
  Fifty-five percent oppose uprooting settlements under a 
permanent arrangement. Thirty-four percent are "very opposed" 
to such a move, and 21 percent oppose it "to some extent." The 
remainder, 45 percent, "definitely support uprooting 
settlements." 
  On Syria, 46 percent are not prepared to return any part of 
the Golan Heights while seven percent are ready to return all of 
the plateau.

Talks in this regard are being held among the Africa-Israel 
Investments Limited [preceding name in English as heard], an 
Israeli investment and tourist affairs company managed by Mr. 
Shlomo (Groffmann) and two investment groups, one Palestinian 
and the other Jordanian. 
  (Groffmann) said his firm is also in touch with investors in 
other Arab and Islamic states to launch economic and tourist 
projects in these states. 
  This Israeli firm had concessions to manage the cartel of 
Holiday Inn hotels in Israel, a well-known international cartel. 
(Groffmann) added that his company has recently created a 
special framework that it called the peace tourism project, in 
cooperation with Dr. Yosef Hadas, who was the director general 
of the Foreign Ministry only a few months ago. The aim of this 
framework, he noted, is to launch joint tourism projects with 
Palestinians and neighboring Arab states. 
  With regard to the Kaliya project north of the Dead Sea, it 
will extend over a tract of land with an area of 310 donums, 
territory completely owned by his company, and another tract, 
whose area totals 670 donums, one-third of which is owned by his 
company. The final cost of this project stands at $250 million.

  [Text] The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation to 
the 91st conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union in Paris, 
Mr. Yahyavi, has strongly criticized the dual and unjust policy 
of the Security Council on the regional and international issues 
and crises. 
  According to our correspondent in Paris, he called for 
strengthening the original arrangements with the aim of 
preserving peace and security and reducing tensions. 
  The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation to the 91st 
conference of the Inter-parliamentary Union held the big powers 
responsible for regional conflicts. He said: Just world bodies 
belonging to the nations are needed to prevent and stop these 
crises. Mr. Yahyavi said: This is the responsibility of the UN 
but, unfortunately, the decisionmaking Security Council and the 
Secretary General often act under the influence of the big 
powers. 
  He said: A clear example in this connection is the dual 
policy of the Security Council vis-a-vis the Bosnian issue and 
the prevention of the despatch of peacekeeping force from the 
Islamic countries on the hollow pretext that it will be siding 
with the Bosnian Muslims, and that too at a time when troops 
from other countries that have close ties with the Serbs have 
been despatched to Bosnia. 
  The head of the Iranian parliamentary delegation stressed 
that the different ways in which the Security Council has dealt 
with the Iraqi aggression against Islamic Iran and that 
country's aggression against Kuwait are the other examples of 
the Security Council's dual performance. 
  Mr. Yahyavi said: The Security Council's decisions should be 
made in an open climate and by being away from behind-the-door 
collusions.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "What Are the Deep Wounds of the </F>
Islamic Ummah?"] 
  [Text] King Fahd of Saudi Arabia disseminated a message in 
which he has expressed regret at the wounds of the Islamic 
ummah. He has also expressed concern about the hiatus in the 
so-called peace talks and hopes of peace! 
  What is worth pondering in this message is the allusion to 
the wounds on the body of the Islamic ummah, which have resulted 
in discord and rifts among the Muslims. It is important to see 
what these wounds are and who has inflicted them. 
  1. Unfortunately, one of the greatest problems of the 
Islamic world at present is that most of the rulers of the 
Islamic countries are affiliated with the dominant powers of the 
world. This situation is further aggravated when these servile 
rulers prefer to obey the great powers and honor them instead of 
following Islam and revering the views of the majority of their 
own people. 
  These subservient rulers have always obstructed any progress 
or action by the Muslims and one of the reasons for the people's 
backwardness is these rulers. This is especially conspicuous 
among the Arab countries, where they lack legitimacy and 
popularity and where the people are even deprived of the right 
to elect their own officials. The Saudi regime is a perfect 
example of such a government. 
  2. Another wound that has been inflicted on the body of the 
Islamic ummah is from those who enjoy the privilege of 
administering the two holy mosques. Pilgramage is an Islamic 
issue and should not be allowed to become a victim to 
international politics. Unfortunately, the administrators of the 
two holy mosques implement policies that have been described by 
the great leader in his 'Id al-Fitr sermon yesterday as 
"obstructing" and "creating obstacles." These policies generate 
the impression in the minds of the Muslims that the pilgrimage 
also takes place in accordance with the whims and wishes of the 
United States and the great powers. The Saudi regime should not 
prevent the Muslims from participating in the grandest conclave 
of the Islamic world. 
  3. What is the justification for the Arab countries' efforts 
for peace with the Zionist regime, which is basically 
illegitimate, just when the uprising of the true owners of 
Palestine is assuming wider dimensions day by day? 
  It is extremely unpleasant for Muslims to observe that a 
group who claims to govern an Islamic country is seeking to give 
official recognition to the Israeli Government in the occupied 
Palestinian territories and when there is a pause in this 
process they become displeased. 
  4. Who has dictated the plot for reducing oil prices in 
order to disrupt the economies of the oil exporters? Why is it 
that the policy of oil production and export of the Islamic 
countries that have the largest recognized oil reserves in the 
Islamic world should be decided by the United States and other 
international powers? 
  5. Who are those who are suffering losses from a slump in 
oil prices and its thousand-percent decrease? Why is Saudi 
Arabia opposing the reduction of its oil production, which would 
result in a rise in oil prices? 
  As the Muslims of the world can see, the wounds of the 
Islamic ummah are not those mentioned by King Fahd but are those 
that have their roots in these affiliated regimes.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] Although no progress was achieved in the so-called 
Middle East peace talks last [Iranian calendar] year, [which 
ended on 20 March,] the commencement of direct talks with the 
Zionist regime paved the way for another pact. The signing of 
the Gaza-Jericho Self-Rule Accord between the PLO and the 
Zionist regime in September was the most important development 
in the Palestinian and Middle East crisis not only during the 
past year but during the five decades of Arab conflict with the 
Zionist regime. 
  The signing of this accord encouraged Washington to 
reactivate its Middle East diplomacy and a meeting was held 
between the Syrian president and his U.S. counterpart in Geneva 
in a bid to reach other compromises in other areas of the Middle 
East crisis. But the failure to implement the PLO-Tel Aviv 
accord destroyed the grounds for other accords and placed a 
question mark over the implementation of this accord as well. 
  Political analysts believe the most important reason for the 
failure of the 'Arafat-Zionist accord is that Israel's wishes 
alone have been fulfilled in this accord. Implementation of the 
major articles of the accord has been postponed, which means the 
PLO has granted Israel extensive privileges without reaping 
anything for itself. The implementation of one part of the 
accord, the withdrawal of the Israeli military forces from Gaza 
and Jericho, was foreseen a month ahead of the accord's signing 
but it did not take place at the set date. Still, Israel 
propounds various pretexts and is not ready to implement this 
part of the accord. 
  The most important outcome of the Gaza-Jericho Accord is the 
legitimization of the usurping presence of the Zionist regime. 
After gaining this big concession, Tel Aviv started its 
extensive blackmail of the Palestinians and the Arabs and every 
country, demanding that the Arabs end their economic sanctions 
and establish diplomatic relations with it. It also called on 
the Western countries to extend more economic aid to it in view 
of this compromise. 
  This accord, which was signed under pressure of the equation 
of the superiority of the Zionist regime and the United States, 
regionally and internationally, and quickly received 
international support, has faced numerous failures during the 
past few months because of the absence of the main elements that 
are needed for its continuation. Political analysts believe 
that the massacre of the worshipers in the Ibrahimi mosque has 
revealed the contradictory aspects of this accord. Its 
implementation is almost impossible without fundamental 
adjustments. 
  'Arafat's insistence on gathering up some Zionist 
settlements 
and disarming their residents, Israel's agreement to limit the 
activities of some extremist Zionist groups, and the dismantling 
of some Zionist settlements show that despite their varying 
views, the two signatories of the Gaza-Jericho Accord seek ways 
to save this accord from total failure. 
  The continuation of the intifadah after the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule pact is considered one of the major 
elements leading to the failure of the accord because, although 
some time after the signing of the Oslo Agreement, 'Arafat 
ordered his forces in the occupied territories to set aside 
their fight against the Zionist regime, the intifadah 
intensified. And although 'Arafat's forces were faithful to 
organizational commands at first, once they knew the details of 
the accord and saw the Zionist regime conitnuing its hostile 
attitude toward them, they joined the Muslim combatants. 
  Although the signing of the Gaza-Jericho Accord strongly 
polarized the combatant forces in the occupied territories, 
contrary to the expectations of the Zionist enemy, the outcome 
benefited the intifadah and gathered together the combatant 
forces under the banner of Islam. Remarks by a U.S. official 
that reaction by Muslim Egyptian society to the tragedy at the 
Ibrahimi mosque may lead to the overthrow of the Cairo regime 
reveals that the struggle against the Zionist regime, which is 
declining among the ranks of the Arab governments, is rising 
among nations and that if the joint struggle of the Muslim 
nations and societies is organized, the current disgraceful 
equation in the Middle East will cease to exist.

  [Text] Israel is trying to heat up the security situation 
in the south to confuse Lebanese Government officials and cover 
up its crimes, notably the children killed in al-Nabatiyah a few 
days ago by Israeli shelling. Tension and anxiety prevail in 
the southern areas adjacent to the occupied border strip in the 
wake of continued threats by Israeli leaders to launch a new 
war. Israeli shelling of southern areas have continued and more 
Israeli reinforcements have been brought to the occupied border 
strip. 
  The resistance men and the occupation forces and their 
agents 
exchanged artillery fire yesterday. The Israeli forces 
bombarded the al-Litani River basin, the outskirts of Zawtar 
al-Sharqiyah, Zawtar al-Gharbiyah, Arnun, al-Hamra' plantation, 
the Habbush bridge, the outskirts of 'Arab Salim, Kafr Rumman, 
al-Nabatiyah al-Fawqa, Kafr Tibnit, Jabal al-Rafi', Mlita, 
al-Luwayzah, Jabal Safi, Mimis, Marj al-Zuhur, and 'Ayn al-Tinah. 
  Israeli helicopters flew intensive sorties over the line 
separating the south and the occupied area and fired flares over 
the western slopes of Mount Hermon. Israeli gunboats cruised 
off the Lebanese coast between al-Zahrani and al-Naqurah 
throughout last night. Israeli forces brought 15 artillery 
pieces to the al-Khardali bridge and stationed them south of the 
township of Blat. 
  This just in from a NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY CORRESPONDENT in 
al-Nabatiyah: The Israeli forces bombarded the al-Sit Zubaydah 
bridge, the outskirts of Habbush, and the road linking 
al-Nabatiyah with Iqlim al-Tuffah between 0100 and 0430 today.

  [Text] Israel is continuing its military pressure on 
Lebanon in an attempt to confuse the social peace process and to 
cover up its crimes and intimidation of Lebanon. Israel 
implemented its threats last night when it carried out 
large-scale aggression against the south. Shortly after 2000 
yesterday, Israeli forces bombarded Lebanese villages. The 
bombardment of several areas is continuing at this moment. A 
NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in al- Nabatiyah reports: 
  [Correspondent] There is a high alert in al-Nabatiyah and 
nearby villages, particularly the Iqlim al-Tuffah villages, as a 
result of violent artillery and rocket fire to which they have 
been subjected since last night. The bombardment, which grew 
more violent at dawn today, was continuing when this newscast 
was being prepared. Heavy rounds are falling in the villages of 
Habbush, Kafr Rumman, 'Arab Salim, Jarju', Jabal al-Rafi, Mlita, 
Jabal Safi, and al-Luwayzah. The explosions are heard 
throughout the whole region. Shells also fell on the main 
highway linking al-Nabatiyah with Iqlim al-Tuffah, particularly 
the Sit Zubaydah bridge. The bombardment is accompanied by 
bursts from heavy and medium machine-guns in Israeli and agent 
[South Lebanese Army] positions in al-Suwayda', Sujud, and 'Ali 
al-Tahir mountain. Violent clashes involving the use of machine 
guns and rockets raged in the 'Ali al-Tahir hills and al- 
Suwayda' area at 2030 yesterday between the resistance men and 
the Israeli forces and their agents. 
  Panic is gripping the people in these areas as a result of 
the continuing shelling. They have not slept for fear of 
indiscriminate bombing. 
  Just in from the editor's desk: All villages in Iqlim 
al-Tuffah have been under violent bombardment since 0615 today. 
Thirty-five shells have landed in these areas this morning. 
  A NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent reports that groups of 
the resistance men attacked enemy positions in Saydun and Dayr 
Shaqadif at dawn today. The Islamic Resistance issued a 
statement saying that its men succeeded in gaining control these 
positions and killing the personnel manning them. The statement 
said that Islamic Resistance men also attacked hostile positions 
in al-Burj, Qasr Salim, Kafr Falus, Sujd, and Bi'r Kallab.

  [Text] Our military correspondent has just reported that 
the Lebanese Army position in Saydun in the Jazzin area was 
attacked by saboteurs at dawn today. The South Lebanese Army 
[SLA] provided support for the Lebanese Army post. A number of 
posts in the Jazzin area, Jazzin, and al-'Ayshiyah came under 
artillery and rocket fire from saboteurs' positions. The SLA 
artillery returned fire at the sources located outside the 
villages, although most of the firing came from inside the 
villages. Our correspondent notes that the saboteurs passed 
through Lebanese Army checkpoints in a region outside the border 
strip to attack a Lebanese Army position. Our correspondent 
confirms that Hizballah's claims that it attacked five SLA 
positions are totally false. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 0831 GMT on 25 March in a 
Sidon-datelined item adds the following: 
  ["Iranian-backed Hizballah guerrillas on Friday killed three 
fighters with Israel's proxy militia in south Lebanon, security 
services said. 
  ["The three South Lebanon Army militiamen were killed in the 
area of Jazzin, which Israel controls, during a dawn offensive 
by Hizballah against eight SLA positions, they said. 
  ["Hizballah said in a statement earlier that it had seized 
two small forts, captured two SLA militiamen and destroyed three 
Soviet-built tanks sent as reinforcements. It said its fighters 
left "several killed or wounded." 
  ["The SLA's Voice of the South radio confirmed the attacks 
but did not mention casualties. It said two of its militiamen 
were taken prisoner at Nab' al-Safa, about one kilometer (0.6 
miles) outside Israel's self-declared security zone. 
  ["SLA artillery hit back firing about 200 shells against a 
dozen villages in the Iqlim at-Tuffah range, a Hizballah 
stronghold southeast of Sidon, Lebanese police said. 
  ["A mother and her son were killed when a shell slammed into 
their home in Jba', police added. 
  ["On Monday, two Israeli soldiers and two SLA militiamen 
were 
killed in attacks claimed by Hizballah and a hardline 
Palestinian group based in Damascus, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. 
  ["The retaliatory shelling killed three civilians, including 
two school children, and wounded 24 others including 15 pupils 
who were on a school bus."]

  [Text] As part of the storming and search campaigns 
undertaken by the military and security forces, a Lebanese Army 
unit last night stormed the housing project building belonging 
to the former Lebanese Forces [LF] in the township of Burayj, 
Qada' Jubayl. Large amounts of weapons and ammunition bearing 
Hebrew lettering were seized. 
  Among the estimated four truck loads of weapons are 300 M-16 
rifles, 20 RPG's, and 20 machine guns in addition to hand 
grenades, radio equipment, and bullet-proof jackets. 
  Another Army unit this morning stormed a second Lebanese 
Forces center in al-Nab'ah. Six 107-mm rockets were found on 
the center's lower floor. 
  Security sources pointed out that the continuing possession 
of weapons and ammunition caches and confessions by people 
arrested in connection with the Sayyidat al-Najat Church crime, 
saying they were instructed to gather information on the 
Lebanese Army centers in particular areas, again prove the bad 
intentions behind this conduct. 
  Elsewhere, naval targets were monitored off the Jubayl and 
Beirut coast today. This called for tightening security 
measures among the Lebanese Army forces along the Lebanese coast 
to prevent it from being used for illegal transportation.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Chief Editor Hasan Sabra: "Lebanese Forces and </F>
Hizballah Are Two Sides of the Same Coin"] 
  [Text] We do not speak the truth for devious purposes, as 
the Lebanese Forces' information media organs and Commander 
Samir Ja'ja' claim. It is true that there should be no double 
standards in Lebanon, that all people are equal before the law, 
and that no one is above the law. We are being true to 
ourselves when we maintain that we support all the security 
measures taken by the Lebanese authorities to pursue the 
suspicious role played by the Lebanese Forces, primarily Ghidras 
[headquarters of Lebanese Forces Commander Samir Ja'ja']. The 
government is not only doing the right thing but is also 
dutybound to use its legal powers to arrest suspects, fugitives, 
and defendants in operations against state security. 
  It is true that the Lebanese Forces' information media 
unscrupulously threaten the homeland's unity, fan the fire, and 
castigate the state and its institutions. These media fail to 
blame the Zionist enemy, who strikes at the homeland, its unity, 
and its Christians and Muslims. As a matter of fact, when the 
media fails to adopt a responsible position they become 
irresponsible and, consequently, the government is not to blame 
for the way it deals with them. Despite their dangerous role 
against Lebanon and its unity, no one has tried to harm these 
media organs. 
  We support the security measures that the Lebanese legal 
authorities have taken to preserve security. The government is 
right when it says that security must cover all Lebanese 
territory. 
  Therefore, we speak the truth and mean it when we denounce 
the military parade staged by the Hizballah in Ba'labakk to mark 
the Jerusalem Day anniversary. We are against this encroachment 
on the state's rights in Ba'labakk, which recurs every month in 
a desperate attempt to restore the atmosphere of the civil war, 
which all Lebanese reject. All the Lebanese people reject the 
civil war and those who seek to remind them of this war and even 
try to endear its destruction to certain people within their own 
ranks. 
  We are against this unilateral act that Hizballah performs 
in 
one Lebanese area after another in an attempt to show that it is 
above the law. We are against Hizballah's attempts to create a 
rift between the people and the state in certain areas, to 
challenge the state's prestige, and to drive out or subjugate 
its establishments. 
  We are against the timing that Hizballah chose to challenge 
the state, first when it insisted on staging the military parade 
in the streets of Ba'labakk at a time when Lebanese security 
forces were doing their duty in chasing and hunting down 
fugitives and wanted criminals on charges of bombings and 
encroachment on the state establishments. It is unreasonable to 
see Lebanese security forces doing their sacred national duty of 
protecting the homeland and citizens' security in one area of 
Lebanon while those in another area have to relinquish that same 
duty and are forced to leave their positions because a military 
force is organizing a military parade. 
  Since it is only natural for the security forces to arrest 
those who carry unlicensed arms and threaten security in 
Ghidras, it is unreasonable for groups to take to the streets in 
Ba'labakk by the hundreds and perhaps by the thousands, flouting 
the state's prestige, threatening national security and 
citizens, defying the people's feelings, provoking the formula 
of coexistence, and arousing hateful feelings that were buried 
once and for all with the end of the civil war and the advent of 
social peace. 
  As we support the security forces in hunting down fugitive 
criminals -- who challenged the state's institutions, laws, and 
organs -- and call for rewarding the security men who performed 
their duty while aware of the dangers confronting them, we also 
call for punishing those who relinquished their official posts 
in the security departments in Ba'labakk and agreed to be 
spectators of the military parade. Those who staged the 
military parade in Ba'labakk sought to negate any state presence 
in the city. 
  Yes, we will bear in mind the actions of Hizballah and 
others 
against the state and its military, political, informational, 
educational, and cultural establishments. Yes, we will not 
ignore its plan to bring down the government in favor of chaos 
where its logic might prevail so that it may control the 
homeland for reasons that have nothing to do with patriotism or 
Islam. We view the parade in Ba'labakk as part of this 
destructive plan under the banner of religion, Jerusalem, 
struggle, and a march. 
  We believe that Hizballah's timing gave the residents of 
Ghidras the opportunity to say something true for unholy 
purposes. We tell the truth for the sake of the truth and for 
selfless goals when we maintain that Hizballah is in harmony 
with the Lebanese Forces in its constant endeavor to remain 
outside the state. Both have a common interest in antagonizing 
the state. Perhaps every move either party makes against the 
state is used to serve the interests of the other party. Both 
parties have become two sides of the same coin, generating chaos 
and serving the interests of others at the expense of Lebanon, 
namely, the state and its establishments. 
  We do not believe that the state is worthy of survival if it 
fails to abide by its own logic that was manifest in two cases: 
First when it did its duty in Ghidras and, second, when it 
hunted down those who challenged the state in Ba'labakk. This 
is the truth told for the sake of truth.

  [Text] Magistrate Munif 'Uwaydat, the Appeal Court's public 
prosecutor, has affirmed that media reports on the bombing of 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il do not originate from 
judicial authorities and their auxiliary security agencies. He 
said measures will be taken against anyone who publishes false 
reports to harm security and mislead the investigation. 
  Magistrate 'Uwaydat said he will sue the AL-KHALIJ AL-'ARABI 
newspaper because it published a false report after identifying 
the individuals who fabricated such news that harms the country 
and the revered clergymen's reputation. He added that the 
paper's editions will be confiscated and measures will be taken 
to ban the entry of such newspapers into Lebanon.

  Judge Daghir instructed the security service to arrest the 
real motivators. He dropped charges against two defendants 
because of a lack of evidence. 
  Judge Sa'id Mirza demanded that the death sentence be passed

<F P=106> [Interview with George Sa'adah, leader of the Lebanese </F>
Phalangist Party, by Radio Monte Carlo reporter Antoine 
Kustantin in Beirut; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sa'adah] In view of what is currently happening on 
the ground, which has created the fears we have spoken about, we 
announced yesterday through the Voice of Lebanon radio station 
that we abide by these decisions. However, we understand that 
they are extraordinary measures which will last for a short 
period of time until the new law on organizing the media has 
been implemented as part of the national reconciliation document. 
  [Kustantin] Don't you fear that this [words indistinct] will 
take a long time? 
  [Sa'adah] That is what we fear and is why we have many 
questions. If the intent is to sacrifice liberties for a short 
period of time for the sake of providing people's safety and for 
stability in Lebanon, then this is acceptable. But if the 
intent is to gag people, especially opposition radios, so the 
rulers will get some relief, this is something else. Therefore, 
we will contact senior officials to speed up measures to pass 
the new media law and end measures to prevent radio stations and 
other media from carrying out their duties. 
  [Kustantin] Concerning stopping the private media from 
broadcasting news, does this decision have any legal or 
political justifications? Are you convinced about the 
justifications? 
  [Sa'adah] If the justifications are for a short period of 
time, it is possible to control news related to the movements of 
the army and security forces and the investigation. Although 
the Voice of Lebanon, which belongs to the Phalagist Party, was 
licensed as a news station long ago, we submit to the Council of 
Ministers' decision if such a decision leads to providing relief 
for the Lebanese public. But this public will not rest if 
liberties disappear. This is what we will watch in the coming 
days. We will not remain silent about any repression of 
liberties. 
  [Kustantin] Concerning the Christian issue, reports say that 
the Phalangist Party was relieved by the decision to dissolve 
the Lebanese Forces Party, as it gives it a free hand to become 
the sole representative of the Christians. Certain papers also 
write about the possibility of your acting within the law to 
regain property over which you are in dispute with the Lebanese 
Forces. How true are these reports? 
  [Sa'adah] Concerning legal actions, some law suits were 
lodged long ago. Other suits have been prepared despite the new 
developments. As for us being relieved by these measures and 
now having a free hand, we have always called for party 
multiplicity and for a political, principled, and ideological 
competition. We are not relieved merely because the Lebanese 
Forces Party has been dissolved. We are relieved because the 
series of explosions have been halted. If the state and the 
security organs had not taken the measures they took, the series 
of explosions would have expanded, spreading the terror we have 
seen recently.

  [Text] The Lebanon's Hizballah revolutionary movement 
expressed concern over a recent decision taken by that country's 
government to ban the broadcast of news and political programs 
by a number of private radio and television transmitters 
throughout Lebanon. 
  On the basis of a Central News Unit report from Beirut, a 
statement issued by Hizballah today states: The decision of the 
Lebanese Government contradicts the most basic social rights and 
freedom of speech. In respect of the critical situation that 
Lebanon is facing -- due to the Zionist regime's aggressions -- 
it is essential to safeguard national achievements, particularly 
the freedom of speech and the press. 
  In another part of the statement, Hizballah supports the 
government of Lebanon's decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces 
Party [LFP] which is accused of involvement in recent bombings.

<F P=106> [Speech delivered by Information Minister Michel Samahah, </F>
marking the 16th anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the 
south, held in the Law and Political Science College Hall in 
Beirut -- live] 
  [Excerpts] O delegates, we address your promising 
conference, its research, and recommendations with every 
confidence that the cultural struggle for liberation completes 
the national struggle and martyrdom in defense of national 
dignity and our sacred right to sovereignty and independence. 
[passage omitted] 
  The liberation of our precious territories in the south and 
western al-Biqa' concerns us all. It is the responsibility of 
the state, which leads all its people, so that we can attain our 
objective together, with the minimum cost. National accord is 
the first step toward strengthening immunity in the face of 
dangers and the occupation. This occupation continued when the 
state was eclipsed. The state and its stability are a principal 
factor in retrieving our right. Any attempt to deal a blow to 
the state means collaboration with the enemy. Do whatever it 
takes to strengthen the state. 
  One-upmanship is like retreat. Both work against the 
homeland and the duty of liberation. We are facing contemporary 
facts that should be well understood, acted upon, and dealt with 
wisely for the sake of the homeland's victory. This stage 
demands that reason prevail. Your homeland is rich with reason 
and qualifications. It is the age of the responsible decision. 
Know that we are now shaping our fate for years to come. 
  O delegates, the homeland rises with action, not with 
emotions. Help to stop your enemy's objective of pushing us into 
the trap of emotional behavior. Stoking up crises does not 
alleviate the consequences. Solidarity in solving these crises 
strengthens the steadfastness. 
  Our principles are constant: no giving up on the right to 
retrieve our occupied territories in the south and western 
al-Biqa' and no bargaining or appeasement over consolidating our 
national sovereignty up to the internationally recognized 
border. The way to do this is to implement the UN resolutions, 
primarily Resolution 425. Lebanon has committed itself to 
solidarity with the brothers, especially Syria. It has 
committed itself to seeking the just and comprehensive peace. 
  We have declared that we seek the just and comprehensive 
peace. But Israel has not refrained from committing aggression 
against our people there daily. 
  O delegates, you know that our domestic unity is the 
strongest shield, especially now when things are turbulent with 
change. We must all stand united to prove that Israel, by 
trying to split our ranks, cannot wrest that which it failed to 
wrest at the negotiating table. 
  The state knows nothing of all this and has confirmed its 
ability to confront any treachery or aggression that attempts to 
undermine our internal stability. We have repeatedly announced 
that security is on a par with freedom and that national unity 
precedes politics and its games. [passage omitted] 
  How can we remain silent over the humiliation inflicted on 
our sons detained in Israeli prisons or in al-Khiyam inside the 
Lebanese border? How can we accept the daily repressive 
practices against our kinsmen and their right to safety, 
dignity, and a prosperous life over their land and inside their 
homeland? [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by Qusayy Salih al-Darwish in Paris and Muhammad </F>
Sadiq in Washington: "Zeroual Authorizes Lemari To Sign as 
Defense Minister"] 
  [Excerpt] As President Liamine Zeroual continued his 
dialogue contacts, the attention of the political circles 
focused on a presidential decision published in the official 
gazette in which President Zeroual authorized Chief of Staff 
Major General Mohamed Lemari to sign for him as defense 
minister. Some observers see that as being tantamount to an 
appointment of Maj. Gen. Lemari as second defense minister. The 
matter seems to have caused sharp arguments at the military 
command's meetings last Wednesday and Thursday. Although Maj. 
Gen. Lemari rejected the post of defense minister when Zeroual 
became president and also objected to anyone else assuming that 
post, as a result of which President Zeroual himself assumed the 
post, giving the chief of staff this authorization now means 
that those opposed to President Zeroual's move toward political 
dialogue have scored an important point, particularly as it 
coincided with the partial acceptance of Maj. Gen. Lemari's call 
for a change of military district commanders. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
has learned that 5th Military District Commander Major General 
Abdelhamid Jouadi, First Military District (the capital) 
Commander Major General Jnouhat, and Land Army Command Major 
General Khalifah Rahim have been relieved of their posts. The 
names of the officers who will replace them have not been 
revealed yet but they may well be supporters of Maj. Gen. Lemari 
and the hard-line trend in the Army. 
  Meanwhile, the military forces are launching attacks on the 
areas where fundamentalist gunmen are active. According to some 
sources, these attacks have resulted in a large number of 
victims described by the security authorities and the media as 
"terrorists." Maj. Gen. Lemari and the hard-line trend appear 
to be banking on achieving tangible results in the field of 
security that would provide the answer to those who claim that 
the regime has no option other than dialogue following the 
failure of the security option. 
  In the capital, Algiers, yesterday there was a gathering of 
secular forces opposed to political dialogue with the Islamic 
Salvation Front. Some 30,000 people, mostly women, attended.

developments in Somalia were discussed at a meeting of the 
Central Organ for Conflict Resolution [COCR] in Addis Ababa. 
  Minister Musa said that the COCR issued a final statement 
expressing appreciation for President Husni Mubarak's efforts to 
resolve the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon and the Somali 
crisis. The Egyptian foreign minister said that Egypt will 
contribute $100,000 in assistance to the COCR. 
  Minister Musa said that Egypt welcomes the agreement signed 
yesterday among Somali parties and sees it as a significant step 
toward resolving the Somali crisis. Musa said that the Somalis 
are now faced with the task of electing a new president and vice 
presidents and forming a government, judiciary, legislative 
council, and local councils. 
  The Somali parties have made a significant achievement 
because their agreement outlines the country's path to 
reconciliation. Many Somalis have noted that the talks held in 
Cairo were instrumental in arriving at this agreement, Musa 
said. The foreign minister will present a full report to 
President Mubarak today about the COCR meeting in Addis Ababa.

  [Text] The London-based JEWISH CHRONICLE said in the latest 
edition, last Friday, that British Defense Secretary Malcom 
Rifkind told Jewish deputies in Glasgow that the European 
continent faces threats from some Arab states. He said that 
Libya possesses rockets capable of hitting targets in southern 
France, Italy, and Spain. JANA's international affairs editor 
commented on this statement. He said: 
  This is the second statement of its kind made by the British 
defense secretary in less than a month. This confirms that the 
statements of the British officials constitute part of a 
psychological terrorist campaign that has been continuously 
waged by western colonialist circles against the Libyan people 
and its revolution. This campaign aims at distorting the image 
of the Great Jamahiriyah before international public opinion, in 
an attempt to prepare it to accept any irresponsible action that 
could be taken or carried out against the Jamahiriyah. 
  This reminds us of the huge campaign of lies and distortion 
that preceded the aggression against Libya half-way through the 
month of al-Tayr in 1986. These allegations launched by some 
western officials against the Great Jamahiriyah could only be 
considered real official terrorism which is inseparable from the 
unfair sanctions imposed on Libya in the name of the Security 
Council by Western countries which dominate this council. 
  The Great Jamahiriyah has repeatedly stressed that it does 
not have the capacity to own those destructive weapons, and that 
it has never been interested in them or thought of possessing 
them because it was mainly busy building its economy and 
achieving self-sufficiency in food and water and implementing 
its development plans despite those unjust coercive measures 
that seek to obstruct that and deprive Libyans from building 
development on their land. 
  History shows that we have never threatened or attacked the 
Europeans in their lands because we consider them human beings 
and respect them. As for those who make such statements, 
history witnesses that it is they whose relations with us have 
always been those of invasion, colonization, and ongoing 
attempts to dominate us and control our destiny.

  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn returned to the homeland 
this afternoon with God's care at the end of visits to the 
Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar. During his visits, 
his majesty and his brother Sultan Qabus Bin Sa'id, and his 
brother his Highness Qatari Amir Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al 
Thani, exchanged views on various current Arab and international 
issues, in addition to the unqiue relations between Jordan and 
each of the Sultanate of Oman and the State of Qatar, and the 
latest developments in the peace process in the wake of UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 904. 
  His Majesty King Husayn spoke to the press about the visits 
following his return to the homeland: 
  [Begin recording] [Husayn] In the name of God, the merciful, 
the compasionate. The visit to the Sultanate of Oman, the 
meeting with the brother sultan and the relatives there was 
excellent. It is a continuation of the solid relations between 
us; relations among brothers. Also, my visit to fraternal Qatar 
was a very good visit. It gave us the opportunity to discuss all 
matters that interest us in the Arab homeland, and the course of 
events, such as the peace process and the situation in the 
occupied territories with respect to the past and the present. 
Thank God, the solid groundwork on which we established our 
relations years ago are still solid. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Sir, how do you view the scope of 
joint Arab action in light of your visit to the fraternal 
countries? 
  [Husayn] We have every hope that God almighty will guide the 
Arab leaders so they realize the importance of these 
circumstances and the need for work to confront these challenges 
in a manner that satisfies all of us. It goes without saying 
that these are fateful challenges. As for the brothers I 
visited, it seems to me, or I am confident, that we proceed in 
the same direction and adopt the same approach toward all that 
has taken place. 
  [Reporter] What about your talks with Sultan Qabus about 
Jordanian-Omani joint efforts on Yemeni reconciliation. Is 
there anything new in this respect? 
  [Husayn] The new thing is that, thanks to God, there has 
been 
an effort that was successful from the beginning. We have been 
working for many months. This is our duty in response to a 
Yemeni and Arab request, and out of our duty toward our 
brothers. Then came the document, and Yemen, with all its 
representatives meeting here, ratified the document. We were 
then surprised by the painful and disturbing reports. A joint 
military delegation left and assumed its role as best it can. 
Thanks be to God, they completed their task. With respect to 
the future, I am confident that we will always be ready to carry 
out any duty. However, the basic job should be done by the 
brothers in Yemen toward what they ratified and what reflects, 
in my opinion, the aspirations and wishes of all the sons of 
Yemen. We ask God for the success of the task we and the 
brothers in Oman have carried out. 
  [Reporter] Your majesty, there are resolutions that preceded 
resolution 904 on Jerusalem, saying that it is occupied Arab 
land. How do you view Jordan's stand in this direction? 
  [Husayn] We now seek clarifications on the stand. But, all 
the UN Security Council resolutions view Jerusalem as part of 
the Arab lands that were occupied in 1967. It seems that a few 
years ago, there was a warning from the U.S. side that if the 
question of Jerusalem was raised, then the stand would be the 
one that has taken place, or they said that their stand would be 
firmer with respect to using the veto. Actually, and as I said 
a fews days ago, I was taken by surprise by the situation on 
Friday. I was in the south, and I immediately returned. 
Perhaps, for certain considerations, it was a mistake to raise 
the issue of Jerusalem. The world at large knows Jerusalem is 
part of the ocupied Arab territories. In any case, we seek to 
obtain assurances that the stand on this reality and situation 
has not changed. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Qassis, head of the </F>
Palestinian experts' teams in the Palestinian Advisory Group to 
the Arab-Israeli talks, in Jerusalem, with Fayiz al-Miliji in 
Cairo, date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" 
program--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Miliji] Good morning Mr. Nabil and welcome 
to Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Qassis] Good morning. 
  [Al-Miliji] The pressing question now is: Will the PLO 
resume the negotiations with Israel before the resolution 
providing for international protection in the occupied Arab 
territories is implemented? 
  [Qassis] The Palestinian side has posed certain conditions 
for the resumption of talks. They are more than just the 
so-called international protection mentioned in the recent 
resolution. There are other things that relate to the Israeli 
practices at the hands of the occupation troops and the 
settlers, as well as the presence of settlements in densely 
populated areas. All these things need to be tackled before 
negotiations can resume in a meaningful way. 
  [Al-Miliji] But efforts are now under way to bring the PLO 
back to the negotiating table. How far have these efforts gone? 
  [Qassis] According to the information I have, indeed efforts 
are under way, but the Palestinian man in the street wants to 
see compliance with the Palestinian requirements before talks 
resume. Negotiations for the sake of negotiations is not a 
Palestinian demand. We want negotiations that can lead to 
positive results in terms of resolving the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict and recognizing the rights of the Palestinian people. 
There were problems at the talks even before the Hebron 
massacre, and the massacre has exacerbated things further and 
there is now more determination than ever regarding the need to 
tackle the settlement issue properly. 
  [Al-Miliji] But a delay by the PLO in resuming the talks 
could waste what the PLO has gained from its talks with Israel. 
  [Qassis] What has been gained so far from talks with Israel 
is such that if we were to lose it, it would not really amount 
to much. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Miliji] How did the Palestinian masses receive the 
recent 
Security Council resolution on the Hebron massacre? 
  [Qassis] With indifference. This is because the resolution 
did not tackle the core of the problem. 
  [Al-Miliji] But it called for protection for the Palestinian 
people? 
  [Qassis] This is not the first time the Security Council has 
passed a resolution. What counts in the end is getting 
significant protection, not monitoring. We do not want somebody 
to monitor and write reports, we want people to prevent the 
recurrence of such a massacre. This is what is needed. If the 
implementation of the resolution meets this requirement, the 
Palestinian people will receive it positively. But the people 
cannot be enthusiastic about just the text of a resolution; we 
want the resolution to be implemented in a meaningful way. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Miliji] There are reports about renewed clashes in 
Hebron; could you tell us about them? 
  [Qassis] For more than 24 hours, the occupation troops 
besieged a densely populated Palestinian area and it was 
bombarded. 
  [Al-Miliji] What for? 
  [Qassis] Of course we are not in Hebron and do not know if 
what the Israeli radio and press are saying is true or not. 
However, homes were shelled with military weapons, such 
antitank weapons, and I believe four young Palestinian men were 
killed. In the meantime, the occupation troops broke into 
hospitals and terrified children and old people. A pregnant 
woman was martyred. Such Israeli practices leave no room for 
optimism regarding the ongoing talks. 
  [Al-Miliji] Finally, has the Security Council resolution met 
your aspirations? 
  [Qassis] The answer is no. 
  [Al-Miliji] The PLO is between a rock and a hard place: 
either to resume the talks, which may anger the Palestinians in 
the territories, or not to resume the talks and thus delay the 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles. What about 
that? 
  [Qassis] The PLO is the leadership of and part of the 
Palestinian people. The PLO does not handle the situation from 
the standpoint of pressure from the Palestinian public, because 
the PLO represents the Palestinian man in the street. It adopts 
positions that suit the Palestinian interests. There is real 
doubt about the worthiness of a peace process that does not 
tackle the settlements problem. The Palestinian masses' 
position on this issue does not differ from the PLO's. This is 
a Palestinian position being expressed by the PLO, which 
represents the Palestinian people. 
  [Al-Miliji] So could we say that the Palestinian decision is 
not to resume the talks before the necessary protection is 
secured for the Palestinians inside the territories? 
  [Qassis] This is up to the PLO leadership in Tunis to 
announce. I am just telling you what the situation is as we see 
it here among the Palestinian masses. We have requirements, and 
we take these requirements seriously. They are not made just to 
score points. It has been said that peace and the settlements 
cannot exist side by side, and this has been proved to be 
correct. We always said that, and now we see it clearly right 
in front of us. 
  [Al-Miliji] Thank you Mr. Nabil Qassis. 
  [Qassis] You are welcome.

  [Text] A better formula for raising the issues between 
Israel and Syria has been formed. This optimistic and obscure 
sentence was uttered by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last night. 
Rabin once again called on the Syrian regime: Do something to 
underline the seriousness of your peace intentions. Our 
political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin is waiting 
for a gesture by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in the coming 
weeks. According to Rabin, Syria has to underscore its desire 
for peace with actions and not only words. Rabin hinted at the 
possibility of progress with the resumption of the talks with 
Syria in Washington in late April. 
  [Rabin] I believe that some sort of better formula has been 
found to clarify the problems between Syria and us. 
  [Segal] Rabin, who addressed the Council for Peace and 
Security last night, disclosed that he had decided on a 
referendum over the future of the Golan Heights in order to 
signal to the Syrians that they have to do something to convince 
the Israeli public about the seriousness of their intentions. 
That is one of the things Rabin would like to see in the 
negotiations with Syria. 
  [Rabin] With the Syrians, there is the test of normalization 
before we discuss the line on which we will have to make a 
commitment to withdraw. 
  [Segal] The prime minister referred to the support for the 
Hebron massacre among some sectors of the Israeli public. Rabin 
warned against the danger of Jewish racism. 
  [Rabin] The identification among sectors of Israeli the 
public were larger than I had anticipated. I view that as a 
danger of Israeli racism, and more precisely, Jewish racism.

  [Text] Economic and trade cooperation among the developing 
countries will be focus of the G-15 summit opening in New Delhi 
tomorrow. The stage is set for the fourth summit-level 
conference with the heads of state or government of five 
countries arriving in the capital this afternoon. Those who 
arrived are the president of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe; the 
president of Indonesia, General Suharto; the president of 
Nigeria, General Sani Abacha; the president of Senegal, Abdou 
Diouf; and the prime minister of Malaysia, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. 
They were accorded a ceremonial welcome in the fore court of 
Rashtrapati Bhavan [President House]. The president of 
Argentina, Mr. Carlos Saul Menem, is arriving on Wednesday 
[March 30]. 
  The prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, will formally open 
the 
three-day summit as India is the current chairman of G-15. The 
heads of state and government will discuss during the meeting 
restructuring of the United Nations and the future course of 
action of G-15 nations. Global issues of special interest to 
developing countries will be discussed at length. These include 
human rights and terrorism, eradication of poverty, world trade, 
resources for development, and the environment. After the 
inaugural ceremony tomorrow, the plenary will begin. It will be 
followed by informal meetings. On Tuesday, the heads of state 
and government will go for a retreat at Rashtrapati Bhavan to 
continue informal consultations. A joint communique is expected 
to be issued on Wednesday reflecting the consensus of G-15 on 
South-South and North-South cooperation. 
  India has offered training facilities to G-15 countries in 
the conservation of biodiversity and the development of gene 
banks for medicinal and aromatic plants. It has already set up 
three national gene banks and published an inventory of plants 
and rare species of proven medical value. The project has been 
taken up following a decision of the Kuala Lumpur summit of G-15 
nations. New Delhi is also coordinating implementation of three 
other projects. A status report on the project says that a data 
bank on solar energy applications will be ready by the middle of 
the year.

<F P=106> [Address by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao at the </F>
opening session of the G-15 summit at the Vigyan Bhavan 
conference hall in New Delhi -- live] 
  [Text] I declare open the inaugural meeting of the fourth 
summit of the summit-level group of South-South consultation and 
cooperation, the Group of 15 [G-15]. 
  Excellencies, presidents, prime minister, our honored 
guests, 
special envoys, ladies, and gentlemen: I have pleasure in 
welcoming our distinguished guests, the heads of states and 
government, and their delegations to New Delhi on the occasion 
of the fourth summit of the Group of 15 for South-South 
consultation and cooperation. Though your visit this time may be 
short, I hope you will be comfortable and have an opportunity to 
see something of this historic city. 
  This summit represents an opportunity to see how best the 
creative energy of our group can be released to serve our common 
objectives of peace and development through cooperation and 
engagement in a rapidly changing world. Excellencies, we are a 
young group, but our concerns are age-old. We are compact, but 
our vision extends across continents. To realize our unique 
potential as a group, we must emphasize our transregional 
personality. Our activities must draw sustenance from and in 
equal measure contribute to our cohesion as a group. They 
should be comprehensive and imaginative enough to lead to the 
willing and positive participation of countries from different 
continents, such as we are geographically distant yet compact, 
in close cooperation and close in purpose. 
  These are not easy tasks when urgent and varied domestic and 
regional developments demand our attention. However, equally 
compelling is the longer-term imperative of steering our 
countries toward a balanced and synergy of national, regional, 
and global interests. I am convinced that this is extremely 
important. 
  At this G-15 summit we hope to demonstrate that our 
absorption in the tasks of today will not come in the way of our 
seriously addressing the emerging and transcendent issues of 
tomorrow. Excellencies, the pace of change in the last few years 
has been rapid. The end of the Cold War, the intensified 
globalization of national economies and the technological 
revolution are just a few elements of this change. Yet the 
transcendent issues to which I refer are still with us. We saw 
the promise of peace, but it has been far from realized. Forces 
of conflict manifest themselves primarily as attempts to 
undermine the nation-state system on which the international 
order rests. They have assumed dangerous proportions and 
diverse forms -- terrorism, separatism, and fundamentalism. I 
believe we in the G-15 have the capacity and the conviction to 
mobilize world opinion against such destructive forces as we 
represent the quest for peace, security, and stability. We are 
fully convinced of the need to introduce reforms in the UN 
system and expansion of the Security Council so as to give 
representation to the developing world in the council's 
permanent membership. These issues are engaging our attention 
constantly in the relevant forums. 
  The importance of strengthening economic and development 
cooperation in our interdependent world is recognized around the 
globe. Such cooperation alone can deal with the problems of 
systemic inequalities, macroeconomic imbalances, ecological 
sustainability, stagnation, and widespread poverty. 
Protectionist barriers against developing country exports and 
discriminatory and restrictive regimes governing the flow of 
technology must be lowered. There should be adequate 
appreciation of our capacity and potential to not only develop 
rapidly, but in the process to act as effective catalyst for the 
regeneration of the world economy. We shall exemplify the 
intrinsic symbiosis between the interests of the industrialized 
countries and those of ours. 
  Our determination to build up intrinsic capacities to 
expand cooperation among ourselves is firm. Extraneous efforts 
of developing countries, not least those of the members of this 
group, to transform and liberalize our economies and to 
integrate them with the global economy is aimed at charting a 
new trajectory of growth. This factor, as well as the 
substantial progress achieved by some of us, have created the 
basis for meaningful and functional networks of relationships -- 
commercial and technological -- between and among ourselves and 
with the rest of the world. Cooperation between developing 
countries on a regional and transregional basis has assumed an 
urgent dimension for us to extend the frontiers of growth. As 
we grow in collective strength, so too will our individual and 
joint capacities for development, to enable us to contribute to 
the establishment of a more equitable, balanced, and prosperous 
world order. Our attempts to intensify our interaction with 
regional free trade and economic cooperation arrangements could 
affirm the value of open regionalism and of becoming viable 
growth centers for the free flow of trade, investment, and 
technology across national and regional borders. 
  Cooperation in the G-15 is tethered to the concrete programs 
and projects. Over these four years, the projects we have 
undertaken are in various stages of implementation. We have 
already made some progress in establishing databases and 
information networks on complementarities and opportunities for 
mutually beneficial trade, investment, and technology. Some of 
our projects operate within the matrices of critical need, 
natural advantage, and environmental sustainability. Some other 
projects seek to establish and strengthen the much-needed 
infrastructural links among our countries, and yet others are 
intended to stimulate intra-industry trade and cooperation in 
key sectors, such as petrochemicals. The G-15 Business Forum, 
which meets regularly along with the summits, is another 
concrete expression of cooperation where political purpose is 
translated into practical business opportunities. We are 
conscience of the constraints -- infrastructural and attitudinal 
-- that have so far circumscribed the full potential of 
intra-G-15 trade and economic cooperation. This must change. 
We also admit that our cooperative projects need to be better 
targeted and more effectively implemented if they are to make an 
impact. The program itself being a pioneering task, such initial 
shortcomings are to be expected. Yet a good beginning has been 
made and it is my earnest wish that this summit come up with new 
ideas on achieving improvements. 
  Excellencies, I have continued the practice initiated by His 
Excellency President Diouf of Senegal and communicated our views 
to the chairman of the G-7 in July 1993. I am heartened by the 
response. I am convinced the time is right for carrying such 
constructive consultations further. 
  Excellencies, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade 
negotiations have concluded. We hope that it will, as promised, 
bring about further liberalization and expansion of the world 
trade to the benefit of all countries, especially the less 
developed trading partners. We also expect that the norms and 
institutions that we have established in the context of the 
World Trade Organization will in their actual operation uphold 
the rule of law in the realm of international trade and that the 
rights and interests of weaker trading partners will be 
protected. They must also take care to ensure that the barriers 
to trade that the Uruguay Round is to lower are not replaced by 
new barriers against developing-country exports in the guise of 
noneconomic concerns. We already have reason to be concerned 
about attempts to undermine multilateralism and agreed 
frameworks for the liberalization of trade. These manifest 
themselves in their resort to unilateral actions, demands for 
concessions beyond those agreed to in the round, and attempts to 
introduce new protectionist agendas. 
  All of our countries recognize the importance of increased 
investments in our productive and technological capacities for 
accelerated growth and development. At the same time, official 
development assistance retains its importance. Concessional 
funding from multilateral financial institutions -- particularly 
in the context of low-income countries, which are striving to 
build basic social infrastructure and alleviate poverty -- is an 
imperative. The burden of external debt is a key resource 
constraint for indebted developing countries. The forging of 
innovative growth-oriented solutions as well as 
non-discriminatory trade and financial policies are needed to 
contribute to increasing the earnings of developing countries. 
  Our commitment to environmental sustainability is total and 
through appropriate policies and measures, we will strive to 
implement our commitments under Agenda 21. On this matter of 
global concern [passage indistinct] may even human survival, we 
in turn expect our partners in industrialized countries to give 
effect to their commitment to make available new and additional 
resources as well as environmentally sound technologies on 
favorable and preferential terms. 
  Excellencies, we are like the pilgrims that our 
poet-philosopher Rabindernath Tagore described in the following 
terms: Yet they are coming the pilgrims one and all; coming to 
their true inheritance of the world; they are ever broadening 
their consciousness, ever seeking the higher and higher unity, 
even approaching nearer to the one central truth which is all 
comprehensive. 
  The fact that we have gathered here from three continents of 
the earth marks a realization of our true inheritance of this 
earth. Our actions in the coming years must confirm that our 
group is larger than the some of its parts and it is worthy of 
this inheritance. Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Leaders of the Group of 15, G-15, are expected to 
come out with new initiatives to enhance South-South cooperation 
at their three-day resumed extraordinary summit beginning in New 
Delhi today. It is one of the major items on the agenda in line 
with the objective of the grouping, that is to strengthen 
South-South cooperation. Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed is among the several leaders who are present in the 
Indian capital for the summit. 
  Our correspondent Vasunta Rajkumaran has these details: 
  [Begin recording] [Rajkumaran] Good morning! Though the 
summit does not draw the full participation of all the 15 heads 
of state or government, it will be no less significant with a 
perusal of the agenda reveals the commitment being attached by 
member countries to ensure the continued development of the 
G-15. One of the major topics to be discussed is the future 
course of the group in a fast changing world. This summit is 
being regarded as a watershed in the development of the group. 
It will provide the leaders an opportunity to look at the G-15 
with fresh perspective. In fact, the group has the potential of 
becoming consultative partners with the G-7 on issues and 
policies affecting the international environment for accelerated 
growth and sustainable development. 
  Malaysia views the G-15 as the beginning of a collaborative 
effort towards a North-South dialogue. The minister of foreign 
affairs, Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, says as there is a 
stronger call for a North-South dialogue, there is certainly a 
role for the G-15 in the future. 
  [Badawi] We have begun to see lately that there is now also 
a stronger and stronger call for North-South dialogue. The 
North-South dialogue is something that we must have. But then 
we must begin with a successful South-South cooperation. I 
cannot see how a North-South dialogue can be successful as far 
as advancing the interest of the countries of the South as much 
as protecting the interests of the South if there is no 
effective South-South cooperation. And G-15 certainly 
emphasized on that. I would see G-15 as the beginning of a 
collaborative effort towards that. South-South cooperation has 
been much an idea. Since it is an idea, we talk about 
South-South cooperation. So G-15 tries to implement, tries to 
come out with projects that make South-South cooperation a 
reality. 
  [Rajkumaran] The other major issues on the agenda are the 
questions of frequency of summit and the level and composition 
of the summit quorum. The foreign ministers at their meeting 
reached a consensus that the summit should be held every two 
years so as to ensure a better participation among the leaders. 
They have also proposed that heads who are genuinely unable to 
attend summits be allowed to send special envoys. [end recording]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Mar (MENA)--An official Palestinian source 
has stated that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations reached 
a formula for an agreement at dawn today, during meetings held 
in Cairo. The formula explains the task of the Palestinians 
police force and the international observers in the city of 
Hebron. 
  In a statement to MENA today, the Palestinian source pointed 
out that differences persist on certain sensitive points related 
to the security authority in Hebron and the role of 
international observers in establishing and maintaining security 
in the city. 
  The source added that these disputed points, the number of 
Palestinian policemen and international observers, have been 
referred to the Palestinian and Israeli leadership for 
consideration and consultation. 
  The Palestinian source noted that if an agreement is reached 
on these disputed issues, negotiations will resume in Cairo on 
Tuesday. 
  The Palestinian side is requesting that the Palestinian 
police force and international observers include 1,000 men each. 
The Israeli side is absolutely opposed to this number.

  [Text] Cairo, March 26 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel agreed 
Saturday [26 March] that an accord on security for the massacre 
town of Hebron could be signed on Tuesday, clearing the way for 
a resumption of talks on Palestinian self-rule. 
  The accord could be signed when the two sides reconvene on 
Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are ironed out in 
time, said the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th. 
  "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on 
launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately," 
after a month-long suspension because of the Hebron massacre, he 
told AFP. 
  Sha'th said the agreement would cover the deployment of 
Palestinian police and Norwegian observers in the West Bank town 
where a Jewish settler killed 30 Moslem worshippers on February 
25. 
  The Israeli government will "commit itself to adopt measures 
to prevent friction" between the 450 settlers and 120,000 
Palestinians of Hebron, he added. 
  Sha'th confirmed earlier reports from Israel that the key 
outstanding issue was the number of police and observers to be 
posted in the town. 
  The police will be posted at fixed points around Hebron to 
guard schools, hospitals and the university, he said. Joint 
Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town. 
  He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have 
the final word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will 
be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be 
launched. 
  As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the 
launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which 
the Israeli army was to have pulled out of Gaza and Jericho, 
said Sha'th. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he 
hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a 
final session on the security arrangements for Hebron.

<F P=106> [By Clarisse Lucas] </F>
  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- The PLO and Israel are 
optimistic that a Hebron security accord will be signed here on 
Tuesday [29 March] to clear the way for the resumption of 
autonomy talks after a one-month break. 
  A senior Palestinian official said Sunday the PLO was 
putting 
to one side its demand for the evacuation of the 400 Jewish 
settlers who live among 120,000 Palestinians in the massacre 
town of Hebron. 
  "The departure of the Hebron settlers is a pressing demand 
so 
as to prevent further violence, but it is not a precondition," 
Muhammad Subayh, secretary general of the Palestine National 
Council or parliament-in-exile, told AFP. 
  Although Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has ruled out 
their withdrawal, an Israeli source said the settlers living in 
five areas of Hebron could be regrouped. 
  The PLO and Israel agreed over the weekend that the only 
serious issue left was the number of Palestinian policemen and 
Norwegian observers to be deployed in the occupied West Bank 
town of Hebron. 
  Israel accepted the deployment of lightly armed police and 
foreign observers in talks with the Palestinians last week in 
Tunis and Cairo. 
  The accord on Hebron could be signed when the two sides 
reconvene on Tuesday morning in Cairo if the final details are 
ironed out in time, the PLO's chief negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 
Saturday. 
  "As soon as this accord is signed, the negotiations on 
launching autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume immediately," 
after a one-month suspension by the PLO because of the February 
25 massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a settler, he said. 
  The Palestinian police will be posted at fixed points around 
Hebron to guard schools, hospitals and the university, said 
Sha'th. Joint Israeli-Palestinian units would patrol the town. 
  He implicitly acknowledged that the Israeli army would have 
the last word on security, saying "the situation in Hebron will 
be different from Gaza and Jericho," where autonomy is to be 
launched. 
  As for the autonomy negotiations, a final accord on the 
launch will be signed by April 13, the original date on which 
the Israeli army was to have pulled out of the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank town of Jericho, said Sha'th. 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said earlier that he 
hoped the autonomy talks would resume on Tuesday along with a 
last session on the security arrangements for Hebron. 
  Rabin said an accord was in sight on security for Hebron 
Palestinians, as demanded by the PLO as a condition for resuming 
the autonomy negotiations. "I believe we have advanced in the 
right direction," he said. Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres said implementation of the autonomy accord could start "in 
one or two months." 
  A deal on the launch of autonomy was to have come into 
effect 
on December 13, under the September 13 Declaration of Principles 
signed in Washington, but it has been held up mainly by Israeli 
security concerns. 
  Israeli state radio said Saturday that Palestinian police 
would be deployed in nine day's time in Hebron, Jericho and Gaza. 
  Subayh raised an additional Palestinian demand on Sunday -- 
for police also to be sent to the rest of the West Bank. "The 
settlers are everywhere and risks of a massacre exist everywhere 
they live," he said. 
  "The question of the security of the Palestinians does not 
only present itself in Hebron," said Subayh. 
  But Rabin has said the Hebron arrangements were 
"exceptional," and would not be extended to other West Bank 
towns such as Nablus or Ramallah. 
  UN Security Council Resolution 904, adopted on March 18, 
condemned the Hebron massacre and called for protection for 
Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
  After the massacre, the PLO demanded an armed international 
protection force, the disarming of Jewish settlers and 
dismantling of certain flashpoint settlements, including those 
in Hebron.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Arab-Israeli peace talks, in 
Jerusalem, by Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo; date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Aswad] Welcome to our program. 
  ['Urayqat] Thank you. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, let us begin with the situation in 
the occupied territories. The occupied territories are 
simmering with tension as a result of the Israeli repression of 
the Palestinians. You live in the occupied territories; how do 
you assess the situation there? 
  ['Urayqat] The situation is this: Since the terrorist attack 
in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, massacres have occurred daily. The 
Israeli Army is using live ammunition against the Palestinians, 
leading to the deaths of dozens and the wounding of hundreds. 
It is a picture of daily carnage. A residential neighborhood 
in Hebron has been hit by 168 antitank rockets. The unjustified 
measures taken by the Israeli army are exacerbating the 
situation. A curfew is in force and all the occupied 
territories live under siege, all of which seriously undermine 
the economic, educational and health conditions. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators 
speak of progress concerning the deployment of foreign observers 
and Palestinian police in Hebron and the occupied West Bank. 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators, having held 14 hours of 
talks in Cairo, agreed to meet again on Tuesday [29 March] in an 
effort to reach a final agreement. How do you see this 
development? 
  ['Urayqat] First of all, I would like to make this clear: 
The talks recently held in Tunisia and Cairo aimed to find a 
mechanism for implementing Resolution 904, particularly with 
regard to international protection for the Palestinian people. 
These talks do not involve negotiations with regard to the 
Gaza-Jericho or Oslo agreements. Second, with a view to the 
practical steps on the basic level, there are measures that 
still need to be taken. To focus on the Palestinian police and 
international presence but overlook the need to remove the 
settlers from the heart of Hebron will, in my opinion, 
complicate matters further. 
  Efforts should now be focused on evacuating the settlers 
from 
the heart of Hebron because they create a flash point of tension 
and trouble. Looking back, it was the settlers who attacked 
Hebron University, killing four people; who set fire to shops; 
who rampaged through the city; and who harassed the population. 
  I am afraid that deployment of Palestinian or even 
international forces while the status quo remains unchanged in 
Hebron will fail to resolve any problem. Israel should 
therefore take a major step by evacuating the Jewish settlers 
from the heart of Hebron. 
  [Al-Asad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi 
Beilin announced that it is possible to cut short the 
transitional period, which was supposed to last for five years. 
He said that the Israelis and Palestinians should start talking 
about a permanent settlement a few months after the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement is implemented. What do you think of this statement? 
  ['Urayqat] Our position has always been that we should enter 
into the final phase of negotiations immediately. This has been 
the Palestinian position right from the beginning. As you know, 
conditions were imposed on us in Madrid and we were forced to 
enter into a transitional and then a final phase. 
  As for Beilin's statement, let me be frank. Israel is 
speaking with too many tongues all at once: Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says one thing, Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres says another thing, Beilin comes up with a third 
view; and Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur expresses a 
fourth opinion, and so on and so forth. 
  What the Israeli Government must do is turn the statement by 
the deputy foreign minister into official policy. It happened 
in the past that officials, other than the deputy foreign 
minister, made proposals that could have boosted the peace 
process, but the Israeli cabinet silenced them. I fear that 
Beilin's proposal will meet the same fate once it is brought 
before the Israeli cabinet. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat's political adviser Dr. Nabil Sha'th and [chief Israeli 
negotiator at the Cairo talks] Amnon Shahaq have announced that 
they agreed on a draft joint document which will be submitted to 
the Palestinian and Israeli leaders. Do you know anything about 
this agreement? 
  ['Urayqat] I have no information about this document. What I 
wish to make clear is that the current talks in Cairo seek to 
find a mechanism to implement UN Security Council Resolution 
904. They are not talks about the Gaza-Jericho plan or the Oslo 
agreement. I believe it is too early to speak of an agreement, 
even an initial one, because the Israeli Government remains 
intransigent on the basic issue of evacuating the settlers from 
Hebron. I personally believe that it is too early to make 
optimistic statements. 
  [Al-Aswad] Do you think current Arab backing for the 
Palestinian negotiators is sufficient or adequate? What further 
backing are the Arabs required to offer to the Palestinian 
position? 
  ['Urayqat] First of all, inter-Arab coordination is flawed, 
although this is not the time to speak of it. Two days ago, 
U.S. President Clinton made a statement about the status of 
Jerusalem. For this reason, on behalf of all Arabs and 
Palestinians, I urge all Arab leaders, notably Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak, to send an urgent message to President 
Clinton asking him to clarify his position on the remarks 
attributed to him about Jerusalem. If it is true that Clinton 
said Jerusalem is Israel's eternal capital, then I believe that 
the Arab nation and Arab leaders should rally together and 
reassert their united position that there can be no peace 
without Jerusalem. We should keep in mind brother Abu-'Ammar's 
[Yasir 'Arafat] pronouncement that four red lines surround 
Jerusalem: an Arab line, a Muslim line, a Palestinian line, and 
a Christian line. The current peace process and the current 
events concern every Arab. At least, we hope that is so. This 
is not a purely Palestinian-Israeli affair. We are looking for 
total Arab coordination that will lay down strategic Arab 
guidelines for the bilateral and multilateral negotiations. We 
hope this will happen because what we do now will determine the 
region's fate for many years to come. This should concern every 
Arab from the Atlantic to the Gulf. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. 'Urayqat, you referred to the U.S. 
President's 
position on Jerusalem. This position and the reports 
circulating about it have really provoked widespread Arab 
reaction. However, when correspondents representing the 
international media asked the U.S President about the substance 
of his remarks on the status of Jerusalem to the leaders of the 
U.S. Jewish lobby, he replied in these exact words: I told them 
what I also say publicly; namely, that the PLO-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles states that the fate of Jerusalem will 
be determined by the final status talks. What is your comment? 
  ['Urayqat] Even this is a retraction of former U.S. 
positions. When we say that Jerusalem's final status will be 
determined by the negotiations, we mean both East and West 
Jerusalem and an ultimate decision on sovereignty over the city. 
Since 1967 the U.S. position has been that East Jerusalem is an 
integral part of the occupied territories. This situation 
continues. We would like the Arab leaders to send a message to 
President Clinton urging him to reiterate this U.S. position. 
Failing to reiterate this position constitutes a retraction in 
itself, a very serious matter. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you every much. 
  ['Urayqat] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [By Jean-Luc Renaudie] </F>
  [Text] Jericho, Occupied West Bank, March 25 (AFP) -- 
Palestinian officials Friday [25 March] denied Israeli reports 
that autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo Tuesday, 
insisting that full agreement must first be reached on 
protection for Palestinians in the massacre town of Hebron. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat, a senior peace negotiator, said the two 
sides 
must press on with talks held this week in Tunis and Cairo, "to 
agree on measures to protect Palestinians in Hebron, faced with 
settler violence." 
  "No date has been set for resuming the negotiations on 
(Palestinian) self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho" in the 
West Bank, 'Urayqat told AFP here. 
  Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 
AFP that the autonomy negotiations would resume in Cairo 
Tuesday, one month after the PLO suspended the talks over the 
massacre of 30 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in a 
Hebron mosque. 
  Israeli state radio said both sides had agreed that "several 
dozen" Palestinian police would be deployed in Hebron at the 
beginning of April, notably outside municipal buildings and the 
university. 
  The Palestinian police would also patrol jointly with 
Israeli 
soldiers, under overall army command, the radio said. 
  'Urayqat said the Israeli government was presenting the 
security issue the wrong way. 
  "It is not a question of knowing whether Palestinian police 
or foreign observers should be deployed in Hebron, but of first 
carrying out an evacuation of settlers from Hebron." 
  He said that if the 450 Jewish settlers remained in the 
town, 
the presence of Palestinian police or foreign observers "will 
change nothing and the population will continue to live under 
the threat of a new massacre." 
  After the February 25 massacre the PLO called for an armed 
international protection force to be deployed in the 
territories, the disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of 
certain flashpoint settlements. 
  In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two 
sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of 
international observers and a Palestinian police force for 
Hebron. 
  But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume, 
saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the 
Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for 
the Palestinians of the West Bank town. 
  "There are certain points to clear up," Sha'th cautioned. 
  Israeli negotiators agreed on Thursday after two days of 
talks to the deployment of armed Norwegian observers in Hebron. 
  Marwan Kanafani, a close aide to PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
said in Tunis that the PLO was keeping in contact with all 
parties involved, including the United States, Russia and 
Norway, to obtain answers to the PLO's demands following the 
massacre. 
  Norway brokered the PLO-Israeli autonomy accord signed in 
Washington last September, according to which Israeli troops 
were due to start pulling out of the occupied Gaza Strip and 
Jericho on December 13. 
  Implementation of the deal has been set back by the Hebron 
massacre and disagreements over security issues. 
  The occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank were paralysed by a 
general strike Friday to mark the first month since the massacre. 
  Meanwhile, a Palestinian truck driver from Hebron died after 
being shot by a Jewish settler near Beit Jibrin in southern 
Israel, police announced. 
  The 42-year-old gunman fired shots from a car at the truck 
and then fled the scene, but he was later arrested by police in 
the southern Israeli town of Kyriat Gat.

  [Text] Tunis, March 25 (AFP) -- The PLO has not yet decided 
whether to resume negotiations with Israel on launching 
Palestinian self-rule, a close aide to PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat said here Friday [25 March]. 
  Marwan Kanafani said PLO-Israeli discussions set to resume 
in 
Cairo next week "do not constitute a resumption of the 
negotiations." 
  Earlier an aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin told 
AFP the negotiations on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank 
town of Jericho would resume in Cairo Tuesday, exactly one month 
after the talks were suspended over the Hebron massacre. 
  Kanafani said the PLO was continuing its contacts with all 
concerned parties, including the United States, Russia and 
Norway, to obtain answers to demands made by the PLO in the wake 
of the Hebron massacre. 
  A resumption of the autonomy talks "depends on positive and 
practical answers which the Israelis must provide," concerning 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 904, which 
allowed for protection of Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  After the massacre the PLO called for an armed international 
protection force to be deployed in the territories, the 
disarming of Jewish settlers and dismantling of certain 
flashpoint settlements. 
  The Israeli official, declining to be named, said 
negotiators 
General Amnon Shahak and the director general of the foreign 
ministry, Uri Savir, had reported to Rabin on "the progress made 
in the Egyptian capital." 
  "We will go back to Cairo on Tuesday and this time we will 
be 
able to conclude," Shahak, the deputy chief-of-staff, said on 
his return after two days of talks on boosting security for the 
Palestinians of Hebron. 
  The PLO broke off the autonomy talks after a Jewish settler 
massacred 30 Palestinian worshippers in a mosque of the West 
Bank town of Hebron on February 25. 
  In Cairo, chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said the two 
sides had drawn up a draft accord on the deployment of 
international observers and a Palestinian police force for 
Hebron. 
  But he did not confirm the autonomy talks would resume, 
saying only that the negotiators would meet again in the 
Egyptian capital on Tuesday for further talks on security for 
Hebron. 
  Sha'th said the draft accord would be submitted to PLO and 
Israeli leaders. "Important progress was achieved during 
negotiations in the last two days in Cairo but there are certain 
points to clear up," he cautioned. 
  Israeli radio said that if the security measures for Hebron 
were finalized early next week, the negotiations to launch 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho would 
resume "immediately."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jibril al-Rajub, 'Arafat's adviser </F>
on the territories, in Tunis, by Rafi Rosenfeld -- live] 
  [Text] [Rosenfeld] There has been great optimism in 
Israel in the past few days in anticipation of the resumption of 
the Israel-PLO negotiations. Does your organization in Tunis 
share this sentiment? 
  [Al-Rajub] I think it does. Agreement still has to be 
reached on the number of policemen and their weapons, and we 
expect this issue to be resolved tomorrow. 
  [Rosenfeld] Israel does not think the number of policemen 
and their weapons are a big problem. Do you share this view? 
  [Al-Rajub] We do see this as a problem, but if Israel thinks 
it is no problem, then it can be solved within the next 24 hours. 
  [Rosenfeld] How many Palestinian policemen does the PLO want 
in Hebron? 
  [Al-Rajub] Listen, we too do not insist on any particular 
number. So, if the Israelis think this is no problem, we will 
be able to find some compromise. 
  [Rosenfeld] It has been said here that a deal can be 
clinched within a few hours. 
  [Al-Rajub] I hope so. If it is wrapped up today, we will 
start the Gaza and Jericho negotiations tomorrow. 
  [Rosenfeld] With regard to the Gaza and Jericho 
negotiations, there is no certainty that all the problems will 
be solved by 13 April -- the date on which the first part of the 
agreement is supposed to be implemented. Will the PLO insist on 
this date? 
  [Al-Rajub] Listen, I think we cannot solve all the problems 
by 13 April, and even in a year and in two years, there will 
still be difficulties to be overcome. But if we can enter on 13 
April, it will help both sides to overcome the difficulties. 
  [Rosenfeld] Then you insist that at least Palestinian 
policemen enter the territory on 13 April, or that the State of 
Israel make at least a symbolic step on that date. 
  [Al-Rajub] Yes, Israel must make the fist step. In my 
opinion, Israel must make many steps before 13 April. 
  [Rosenfeld] Such as? 
  [Al-Rajub] First of all, the introduction of policemen. 
Second, the release of prisoners. Third, Israel must start 
bringing deportees back home. I think there are many steps that 
need to be taken. 
  [Rosenfeld] The big question is naturally the Army's 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Judging by this morning's 
press reports, there is no certainty that all the difficulties 
will be ironed out and an agreement will be signed by 13 April. 
What will happen if no agreement is signed by then? 
  [Al-Rajub] The failure to sign an agreement for this day is 
unfortunate, but if we start before 13 April, a positive 
atmosphere will be created and there will be a favorable 
attitude for the peace process and the leaders on both sides, 
helping them overcome the difficulties and sign an agreement 
within a short time. 
  [Rosenfeld] Jibril al-Rajub in Tunis, thank you very much. 
  [Al-Rajub] You are welcome. Shalom.

<F P=106> [By Lamis K. Andoni] </F>
  [Text] Israel has agreed to the deployment of a lightly 
armed 50-man Norwegian observer unit and an equal number of a 
Palestinian police force in the city of Hebron but the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) is seeking to expand the unit to 
two multi-national battalions including senior Egyptian officers. 
  Israel will respond to the Palestinian proposals when the 
talks, which were adjourned in Cairo yesterday, resume after the 
two delegations deliberate with their two respective leaderships. 
  The PLO is also awaiting a response to the deployment of a 
8,000-9,000 Palestinian police force in Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip. 
  PLO officials in Tunis expected the Palestinian force to 
cross from Jordan and Egypt by April 13, the agreed upon date 
for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Israel has suggested speeding up the withdrawal in return 
for 
resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, but the PLO 
wanted to get security guarantees that will end the curfew in 
Hebron before going back to the negotiating table. 
  "The way things are moving the actual beginning of the 
implementation will be delayed for two or three weeks, but we 
cannot resume negotiations without seeing real change in the 
situation on the ground especially in Hebron," a PLO official 
said. 
  According to Tunis-based PLO officials, Israel has not 
officially conceded to demands to evict 450 Israeli settlers 
from the centre of Hebron. 
  "The Israelis could not give a word or any promises 
regarding 
the settlers," said one PLO official. 
  The Israelis have implied, however, that the government was 
considering specific measures. PLO officials said that the 
Israeli negotiators refused to elaborate. 
  Israel, the officials said, will be studying a suggestion, 
initially put forward by Norway, that it take unilateral 
measures without prior public announcements, but the PLO prefers 
that a third party, most probably Norway, will act as a 
guarantor to ensure follow-up of whatever process the Israeli 
government decides to start regarding the settlers. 
  Meanwhile, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, who has personally 
insisted on the participation of senior Egyptian officers in the 
foreign observing force, is satisfied with Israel's acceptance 
of the principle of foreign observers but he wanted to make sure 
that it will be a prelude to international protection for 
Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
  The officials said that Israel had stipulated that light 
arms 
will be confined to pistols only--something that seems to 
satisfy the PLO leadership's demands at this point. 
  But what PLO leaders seem to fear the most is for Israel to 
use the siege on Hebron as bargaining chip to pressure 
Hebronites and the Palestinians to drop other demands concerning 
the settlers and the settlements. 
  Critics of Mr. 'Arafat argue that he has not held out long 
enough to make Israel budge, and that if he does not take a firm 
stand, lifting the curfew on Hebron will be used by Israel to 
extract Palestinian concessions. 
  Furthermore, the 20-hour siege of Hebron last week, when the 
Israeli army blasted a hideout for Hamas members and destroyed 
or damaged neighbouring houses in the process, has presented the 
PLO with a challenge of how secure protection of Palestinians 
against Israel army clampdowns. 
  A United Nations Security Council resolution passed two 
weeks 
ago, reaffirmed the applicability of the Forth Geneva 
Convention, that practically bans an occupying power from 
conducting such clampdowns on people under occupation, on the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem. 
  It was unclear so far, based on contacts with PLO officials 
in Tunis, whether that tentatively agreed upon deployment of 
foreign observers will be authorised to prevent Israeli 
violations of the Geneva convention.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Points of Understanding Between </F>
the PLO and Israel"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Reliable sources say 
that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat still has not given his 
final approval for the resumption of negotiations with Israel. 
The sources identified the points so far agreed with the 
Israeli side as follows: 
  1. Presence of international forces in Hebron, as a unit 
including international observers from Norway. 
  2. Formation of a Palestinian police unit for deployment in 
Hebron. It will have a joint Israeli-Palestinian command and is 
expected to consist of several hundred members. 
  3. Joint patrols of Israelis, Palestinians, and foreign 
observers to be formed. 
  4. Seven days after the final agreement between the two 
delegations to the negotiations, a Palestinian armed police 
force to enter the West Bank and assume its task of maintaining 
security. 
  5. The "caravans" quarter in the Jericho area to be vacated 
and the Jews evacuated from central Hebron three months later, 
to be assembled elsewhere, perhaps in the settlement of Qiryat 
Arba'. 
  6. All deportees to be allowed to return to Jericho. 
  7. The PLO leadership to enter Jericho one month after the 
establishment of a Palestinian police headquarters. A vanguard 
force may be allowed in before that to pave the way for the 
arrival of the leadership. 
  The sources say that 'Arafat still has not given his final 
approval and linked the resumption of the negotiations to the 
implementation of practical measures, and that there is still 
some disagreement on details such as the size and powers of the 
international force. 'Arafat has rejected the idea of 
international observers along the lines of the International Red 
Cross and the Relief Agency. There is still some disagreement 
regarding the status and armament of the Palestinian police 
force in Hebron and regarding the evacuation of settlers from 
the area of the holy al-Ibrahimi mosque. 
  According to sources close to the Palestinian president, the 
main issue which still worries 'Arafat and which has been the 
subject of Arab and international contacts is the PLO's 
deteriorating image in Palestinian circles after the Hebron 
massacre. That is why he has sought support for moves to compel 
Israel to make concessions on matters relating to the living 
conditions of the people of the occupied territory, to make them 
feel that there has indeed been some change. 
  Meanwhile, an official spokesman for the Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], led by Dr. George Habash, 
has stated that the second Hebron massacre which was committed 
the day before yesterday -- in which five people were martyred, 
a large number were wounded, and over 10 houses demolished -- 
confirmed that Security Council Resolution 904 did nothing for 
the Palestinian people and only offered a way out for the 
resumption of the negotiations. The spokesman called for an 
immediate halt to the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, 
effective international protection for the Palestinian people, 
and efforts to dismantle the settlements which, he said, are "a 
time bomb set to explode at any moment." The Palestinian 
official spokesman said that it is the duty of the world and of 
the Security Council to protect the Palestinian people, 
implement the UN resolutions, and deter the occupation's policy 
of daily massacres, destruction, and murder. The Palestinian 
spokesman held Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and his 
clique largely responsible for what is going on in the occupied 
territory and urged him to resign. He added: The patriotic 
forces will continue their struggle by all political and 
military means and will escalate the intifadah until the 
downfall of the "Oslo-Cairo agreement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Samir Abu-Ghazalah, head of PLO diplomatic </F>
mission in Cyprus, by Rena Koulermou-Larkou -- place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Koulermou-Larkou] Mr. Samir, it appears from 
your biographical note that you have experienced up close the 
contemporary history of the Palestinian people, you have not 
been a mere spectator. How do you feel now that the talks are 
being held to achieve peace in the region? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] We Palestinians are by nature optimistic 
people, despite that fact that we have suffered massacres, 
terrible difficulties and all sorts of terrorism--from expulsion 
and the refugees in exile, the bombings of our refugee 
settlements with every sort of bomb including even napalm, to 
the recent massacre in Hebron. [passage omitted] 
  We want peace in the Middle East, we want our children to 
grow and live under conditions of peace. We want to see the 
flag of Palestine fly over our land, we want to see our world 
use Palestinian passports and identity cards. 
  We are a people with history and culture. We have 
contributed to the civilization of the whole region and it is 
our right to exist. 
  We went to Madrid believing in peace and we continued the 
peace process of talks without actually having seen any positive 
step by the other side. We even lose credibility in the eyes of 
our own people because we continue to negotiate under such 
conditions. 
  Even after the recent massacre in Hebron we are ready to 
continue the negotiations. In spite of this, the other side 
does not make a positive gesture. For instance, take the 
question of Jericho. We actually talk about the granting of an 
area of 360 square kilometers and we are negotiating 
persistently only for a part of 67 square kilometers. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Mr. Samir, when you referred to your 
people's struggle you said that the Palestinians suffered from 
every sort of terrorism. However, for many years in the West at 
least those who were identified with terrorism were the 
Palestinians. Today, do you believe that it is the Palestinians 
who have changed the way in which they struggle or is it the way 
the world and the mass media view you that has changed? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] First of all, the Palestinians have not 
changed. It is our right, as it is also the right of every 
people struggling for their land, to resist and defend our 
people's basic human rights. 
  We have been deprived even of the right to call ourselves 
Palestinians. Unfortunately, too, things are presented exactly 
the opposite of what they really are. The conqueror who uses 
every kind of attack is not called a terrorist but the one who 
is in defense is regarded as a terrorist. 
  However, sincerely, we do not demand that everyone be tagged 
this or that. We are the victims in this problem and despite 
all this we are committed to the goal of achieving peace in the 
area and to the peace process. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] What are your personal concerns? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] The settlers and their settlements. There 
was a commitment made in Madrid that the talks be based on UN 
Security Council Resolution 242. This means that all the 
Israeli troops and the settlers who were established in the area 
after 1967 must withdraw. 
  My view is that the settlements and the settlers are time 
bombs and they certainly constitute an obstacle to the peace 
negotiations. 
  I do not believe that there can be a solution as long as the 
settlements and settlers remain. The settlers are armed and 
attack simple civilians, even passers-by and, as you have seen, 
they even attack places of worship. Moreover, the Israeli 
Investigatory Committee on the Hebron massacre yesterday heard 
complaints from the Palestinians who described how they are 
provoked daily by the settlers, even before the recent massacre. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] In other words, the settlers are more 
aggressive against the Palestinians; why do you think so? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] Certainly they are more aggressive. I will 
give you a very recent example. One week ago during a 
demonstration, the children of settlers were shouting slogans 
for the massacre of every Arab or Palestinian. [passage omitted] 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] You said earlier that the other side 
has not made even a single positive step in the negotiations 
process. What, in you opinion, would be a positive step? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] There are many questions on which the other 
side could show understanding, such as the question of the 
settlers and settlements, the Jericho area, and many other 
questions that are pending on the agenda of negotiations. 
However, now it is like going around in circles without making 
progress. The other side promises that it will make a 
concession and then it reneges. 
  Unfortunately, many Palestinians are still detained in 
Israeli prisons, there is still intimidation and oppression of 
our people. Of course, the issue of Syria and Lebanon, where 
there are also occupied lands, is still pending. Agreements 
should also be made with these countries and this is envisaged 
in UN Security Council Resolution 242. 
  We hope that with the recent involvement of the Americans in 
the negotiations we will have some tangible results. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] What you just said offers me the 
opportunity to ask two questions. Since we here in Cyprus also 
seems to pin many hopes on the active involvement of the 
Americans, do you think that the Palestinian and Cyprus issues 
are similar problems? Also, concerning the Americans, do you 
get the impression that today's sole superpower has changed its 
policy toward long- standing problems such as the Palestinian 
and the Cyprus problems? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] Concerning your first question, yes, I 
believe that there are similarities in the Palestinian and 
Cyprus issue. However, there are also big differences with 
regard to the refugee aspect and the life in exile. You did not 
have generations born in refugee settlements nor have you been 
forced to live in exile. 
  However, what is necessary in both of these problems is the 
implementation of the UN resolutions on the Cyprus and the 
Palestinian issues. 
  Now, concerning your second question about the involvement 
of 
Americans in long-standing problems, I agree that this is a new 
U.S. policy toward such problems and what appears as a crusade 
to resolve all these problems gives the message that the United 
States is trying to achieve peace in the whole Middle East 
region. Besides, this would be to the benefit of the Middle 
East people as well as to the benefit of the Americans 
themselves. Think of the big economic and geopolitical 
interests that are at stake in the Middle East. [passage omitted] 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Are you disturbed by the fact that Cyprus 
has recently opened an embassy in Israel? 
  [Abu-Ghazalah] This is an internal affair of Cyprus. We 
respect the view and decision of the Cyprus Government and 
people, provided, of course, that the embassy will not be in 
Jerusalem.

  [Text] Brothers, what does this continuing U.S. mention of 
the issue of Jerusalem mean? What is the objective behind it? 
The first mention, which went against the grain of the ordinary 
U.S. policy, was uttered weeks ago when the al-Ibrahim mosque 
massacre occurred, in which Israeli occupiers and settlers 
killed 53 Palestinians and wounded more than 180 others. This 
U.S. statement was made before the UN Security Council. At the 
time it was very clear that nobody could condone the massacre or 
even oppose its condemnation; this is because the ugliness and 
magnitude of the massacre and its racial motivations exposed the 
Israeli hypocrisy, which has been killing Palestinians for years 
and decades in a terrorist, racist, merciless, and harsh manner 
in the occupied land and world capitals; yet the Israelis 
continued to avoid world condemnation. What is more, the 
Israeli hypocrisy used to accuse the Palestinians of terrorism. 
  In the midst of the Israeli official, terrorist, and 
occupationist killing, the United States opposed UN Security 
Council Resolution 904 for three weeks, thus defying the 
international community. It insisted on voting on each separate 
paragraph of the resolution in order that it could abstain from 
voting on an issue that is the most clear-cut of issues -- it is 
the issue of east Jerusalem, which the resolution stipulates 
must be included in the list of occupied territories. This 
stipulation is harmonious with reality and with all past UN 
resolutions. It is also compatible with the measures that the 
superpowers and other countries, including the United States, 
have respected to the letter; they have all refrained from 
opening an embassy in Jerusalem. This was done to avoid giving 
the Israelis the interpretation they have been working for since 
their occupation of the Palestinian land -- to give Jerusalem 
the status of the united and permanent capital of Israel. 
  The issue could have passed if the matter had stopped at the 
U.S. abstention, and after the clarification issued by the White 
House, stressing no change in U.S. policy toward Jerusalem. 
  But what happened the day before yesterday -- after the U.S. 
President met the Jewish communities and after Jewish leaders 
stated that Clinton had pointed out that Jerusalem is an 
undivided city and Israel's eternal capital -- sets off the 
problem from anew. 
  It is true that U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry 
yesterday stressed that there are no changes in the U.S. 
position on Jerusalem, but that statement was general, 
open-ended, and insufficient. It does not resolve the situation 
on a fundamental issue for our Palestinian people, the Arab, 
Islamic, and Christian nations. 
  When we put two and two together, we realize what is behind 
these statements, and this raises our anxiety on such U.S. 
discrepancies and ambiguities over Jerusalem. On the one hand, 
the Administration does not agree on a paragraph which does not 
state Jerusalem's occupation, and on the other they leave the 
U.S. President's office to announce what he had told them was 
his position -- on Jerusalem being Israel's unified capital. On 
another occasion, the official spokesman for the State 
Department, and not for the White House, speaks ambiguously and 
in general terms that there is no change in the American 
position on the issue of Jerusalem, without specifying the 
position and without redefining that position. 
  Some have criticized the PLO because it forced the city of 
Jerusalem into the UN resolution. This led to the U.S. 
abstaining from the vote. 
  Notwithstanding our willingness to accept all critics, we 
still think that blind persistence and/or hiding one's head in 
the sand will not help anyone. On the contrary, it will make 
things worse. 
  The American stance and policies are not merely reaction. On 
the contrary, there are acts and policies which are well planned 
in advance, as well as tactical pledges. It is therefore 
necessary to raise them in order find out exactly what they are 
leading to, to know how to deal with them, and which weapons one 
should use. 
  We believe that the current American Administration is under 
greater pressures from the Jewish lobby in the United States -- 
which might be behind the Whitewater issue which has become a 
powder keg that might destroy this Administration -- when 
dealing with the Palestinian problem and the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. It is therefore a problem which has made matters more 
difficult and more complicated, and has made it necessary to 
face up to the problems, however complicated they might be, 
foremost of which is Jerusalem. Jerusalem should be viewed as an 
occupied city and a holy city, not only to Muslims but also to 
Christians, whose right to their holy city has been questioned 
by President Clinton, who has chosen ambiguity as a means for 
fulfilling the Jewish illegitimate aims. 
  It is true that Jerusalem is on the table of negotiations 
within the agreed timetable of the negotiations. However, such 
an admission should not change the fact that it is an occupied 
city, and that negotiations will not be about whether it is an 
occupied city or not but on its future, in a such a way that 
would bring about balance and fairness, and meet the rights of 
all parties concerned. 
  Jerusalem cannot be eternally united as the Israelis have 
been asserting, because the word eternal is a gratuitous one. 
Nothing is eternal as far as history is concerned.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League Council held a 
closed session this afternoon, following the end of its opening 
session. 
  MENA has learned that the Arab League Council will discuss a 
number of political, economic, legal, and financial matters at 
the closed session. Four committees have been formed for that 
purpose: A political committee, an economic committee, a 
financial and administrative committee, and a legal committee. 
  The political committee will discuss the Arab boycott of 
Israel in the second and third degrees--in other words, an 
indirect boycott. It will listen to a briefing from the 
secretary of the Arab Boycott Bureau in Damascus on the boycott 
and its implications for the peace process. The committee will 
examine the U.S. request that the boycott be lifted on U.S. 
companies that participate in developing and rehabilitating the 
Palestinian self-rule areas following the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles. The political committee will also 
debate a report on Arab national security at a time of 
fast-breaking international changes. 
  MENA has learned that the economic committee will discuss 
the 
formulation of a unified Arab position vis-a-vis GATT, which 
will be signed in April in Morocco. The economic committee will 
also discuss the economic repercussions of peace, particularly 
with regard to the possible establishment of a Middle East 
market. The committee will also review various agreements 
concluded by the Arab League and its institutions and assess 
their effectiveness. 
  The financial and administrative committee will discuss the 
contributions by member states to the League's 1994 budget, 
estimated at $28 million. It is expected to urge the members to 
pay their contributions on time so as to help the Arab League 
institutions perform their duties. 
  The legal committee will discuss a number of important 
topics, including the status of Palestinian refugees in a number 
of countries and the care they receive, the performance of the 
United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and a number of legal 
matters pertaining to the Arab League.

postpone its debate of the proposed amendment of the Arab League 
Charter and the formation of an Arab court of justice until the

following the next Arab summit meeting. 
  The Arab League's General Secretariat had prepared a 
proposed 
amended Arab League Charter, by which resolutions would be

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)-- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
has emphasized that the Egyptian stance on southern Sudan is 
clear and resolute. We can never back any attempt to separate 
southern Sudan from the north. 
  Speaking to reporters following the closed session of the 
Arab League ministerial council, Musa said the council decided 
to postpone discussion on the amendment of the league charter 
and relevant issues until Arab conditions improve and consensus 
is obtained on the amendment and its terms. 
  He noted that the seven-member committee will hold a meeting 
this evening to discuss the Lockerbie crisis and developments in 
Libya's crisis with the West. 
  Touching on a meeting among the foreign ministers of cordon 
states on the sidelines of the foreign ministers session, 'Amr 
Musa said: We did not discuss this subject and there are no 
arrangements to hold such a meeting on the sidelines of the 
ministerial council session. 
  Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih praised Musa's 
remarks on southern Sudan, saying: We thank Egypt for this 
strategic stance, which seeks to preserve Sudanese unity, 
because Sudan's security is the same as Egypt's and is part of 
the pan-Arab security. 
  He described his meeting with 'Amr Musa today as 
"fraternal". 
  The Sudanese minister hoped official dialogue will continue 
between the Egyptian and Sudanese sides in Khartoum. We welcome 
Minister 'Amr Musa in Sudan to resume dialogue on disputed 
issues and resolve them, he said. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said that the Arab 
boycott of Israel was not raised during the new session of the 
Arab foreign ministers council that started today. What we 
discussed is the report submitted by the Damascus-based Arab 
Bureau on the Boycott of Israel, he explained. 
  Al-Shar' added that Arab parties have agreed to postpone the 
issue of amending the charter until an Arab summit is held, in 
view of the importance of the topic. 
  Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal stated that the 
council's discussions today were constructive and that an 
agreement was reached to postpone discussion on the amendment of 
the charter because of its importance. 
  He added that a number of remarks were made on that topic, 
including the view that this important matter should be 
discussed when the Arab atmosphere is more favorable so that the 
charter can be reviewed after due consideration and away from 
side issues that can affect Arab solidarity. 
  Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's delegate to the Arab League, 
said 
today that he will submit a full report to a seven-member 
committee that includes the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria, 
Libya, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih stated, 
following his meeting today with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa, that an agreement had been reached with him on the need to 
make greater efforts to correct the course of relations between 
Sudan and Egypt, so as to promote the destiny of the peoples of 
the Nile Valley. 
  Concerning attempts to separate southern Sudan from the 
north, the Sudanese foreign minister said that those attempts 
would be fruitless. He added that Sudan would absolutely not 
allow any attempt to dismantle its unity. He said that Egypt 
had declared, strongly and frankly, its support for Sudan, as it 
was aware of the dangers of disintegration and fragmentation, 
not only with regard to Sudan itself, but in the entire region 
as well. 
  Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih expressed his appreciation at 
Egypt's strategic stand [word indistinct], out of its concern to 
preserve the unity of Sudan, as the security of Sudan and Egypt 
were closely linked. 
  For his part Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said that 
he 
had spoken with Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih concerning issues 
of interest to the countries and the future of relations between 
them, besides the subjects discussed by the Arab League Council. 
Mr. 'Amr Musa stressed Egypt's stand on southern Sudan: That 
it would not support any attempt for the separation of southern 
Sudan.

  [Text] Cairo, March 26 (AFP) -- Arab countries oppose 
efforts by Oman and Qatar to end a boycott on firms doing 
business with Israel, a diplomat close to the Arab League said 
Saturday [26 March]. 
  The two Gulf oil states recently began "intensive efforts" 
to 
ease the embargo, but "this campaign did not win the approval" 
of other Arab countries because of the February 25 Hebron 
massacre, the diplomat told AFP. 
  "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect 
boycott" affecting companies dealing with Israel, the diplomat 
said on condition his name not be used. 
  Diplomats, who had expected the Arab League to agree to lift 
the indirect boycott, said Saturday the "climate was not 
favorable" because of the massacre of 30 Palestinians by a 
Jewish settler in the West Bank town of Hebron. 
  The United States had called on Arab states to ease their 
46-year-old trade boycott of Israel in recognition of the accord 
on Palestinian self-rule signed in September. 
  But Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said on arrival 
in 
Cairo for the Arab League meeting: "The boycott of Israel was 
decided because of its occupation of Arab lands. 
  "It cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from 
occupied Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own 
state," al-Shar' said. 
  Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of 
Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said. Apart from "one 
or two countries," other Arab states had the same view, he added. 
  Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to 
support such a move if it came to a vote. 
  Since the Israeli-PLO accord was signed on September 13, 
Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted in 
exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank town of Jericho where autonomy is to be launched. 
  Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in 
1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of 
drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests 
in Israel. 
  Apart from Egypt, which made peace with Israel in 1979, only 
Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year. 
  Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani met 
in London in January with Israeli counterpart Shim'on Peres and 
called for a lifting of the boycott. 
  Oman has invited Israel to attend a multilateral meeting on 
Middle East water resources on April 17 -- the first such move 
by a Gulf country.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, 
Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign minister, has 
stated that his country is committed to the first-degree Arab 
boycott against Israel [direct dealings with Israel]. He noted 
that Kuwait previously announced lifting the second- and 
third-degree boycott against companies dealing with Israel. 
  In a statement on the sidelines of the Arab League 
Ministerial Council meeting in Cairo this evening, the Kuwaiti 
official said his country cannot lift the first-degree boycott 
before an Arab League decision is issued in light of the 
developments in the peace process. 
  On Kuwait's position on the Libyan-Western crisis, al-Sabah 
said: We support Libya provided that the UN Security Council 
resolutions are implemented. He pointed out that the embargo 
against Libya was a Security Council resolution and that Kuwait 
had nothing to do with its issuance. 
  He said he does not know what difference it will make if the 
Libyan suspects are tried in Scotland or any other place.

  [Excerpt] Cairo--The Arab League Council concluded its 
first session at 1400 today. During this session, the Council 
approved the agenda of the Arab League Council's 101st ordinary 
session. 
  Answering reporters' questions after this session, [Syrian] 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' stressed that the Arab boycott 
of Israel was not included on the agenda of the Arab League 
Council's session. He added that the Council reviewed the 
report of the Damascus-based central Arab Boycott Office. 
  Al-Shar' said: The issue of discussing or lifting the second 
and third degree of the boycott will not be discussed at the 
Council's session. He noted that this issue was decided at the 
Council's economic committee. 
  Asked about Syria's position on the issue of amending the 
Arab League Charter, the foreign minister said this issue was 
postponed until there is a sound and healthy Arab situation so 
the amendment can be made on sound basis. He said: In view of 
the importance of this issue, it requires an Arab summit. 
  Al-Shar' announced that the seven-member ministerial 
committee charged with following up the Lockerbie crisis will 
meet at 1700 today to discuss the latest developments in the

  [Text] The Arab League ministerial council resumed its 
closed session this evening to continue discussion of the items 
on the agenda, particularly developments in the Middle East 
peace process, the situation in Golan, south Lebanon, and 
Somalia, as well as pan-Arab security. Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa chaired the Egyptian delegation. 
  Our radio correspondent has learned that during its first 
meeting today, the council adopted a resolution on developments 
in the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The 
resolution expressed regret at the security and military 
agreement France signed with Israel, which helps Israel to 
occupy Arab lands by force. 
  The resolution called on the UN Security Council, 
particularly the cosponsors of the peace process, to make 
efforts to avert the deterioration of the peaceful process due 
to aggressive Israeli practices in the occupied territories. It 
called for speeding up the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 465, which calls for eliminating the settlements and 
views them as obstacles to peace. The resolution affirmed that 
the establishment of a just and all-embracing peace in the 
region depends on Israel's commitment to implementing UN 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and on enabling the Palestinian 
people to set up their independent state with honorable 
Jerusalem as its capital. 
  In the meantime, the Arab League ministerial council voiced 
its deep concern at current developments in Yemen. In a 
statement issued today, the council appealed to Yemeni political 
leaders to double efforts to resolve differences in a manner 
that enhances unity and contributes to the establishment of 
stability and peace in Yemen. The council pointed out that 
unity in Yemen is a national gain and a pan-Arab accomplishment 
that should be preserved and enhanced. 
  In another development, the seven-member Arab committee of 
the council held a meeting this evening under the chairmanship 
of Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid. The meeting discussed ways to find 
a peaceful solution to Libya's crisis with the West that 
preserves Libya's national sovereignty and respects the 
principles of international law, which stress solving disputes 
peacefully. The committee has issued a statement to this effect. 
  The outcome of the committee's meeting will be referred to 
the ministerial council this evening. Egypt, Syria, Libya, 
Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania are taking part in the 
committee's meeting.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Arab League council will 
resume meetings of its 101st session tomorrow morning at the 
Arab League headquarters. Remaining items on the agenda will be 
discussed at the meetings, which will be chaired by Yemeni 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah. 
  An official Arab League source said at the end of the 
evening 
session today that the council discussed most items on the 
agenda, notably the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Yemeni problem, 
Somalia, and Sudan. 
  The source said the council stressed Sudan's unity and its 
rejection of any attempts to separate the south. Concerning 
pan-Arab security, the source said the subject was deferred to 
the next session for further discussions on the various aspects 
of the issue in light of current developments. 
  The source said the council also discussed the Arab League 
secretary general's report on developments between the previous 
session and this one and what was implemented from the 
resolutions of the previous session. 
  [In a related report, Cairo Arab Republic of Egypt Radio 
Network in Arabic at 2100 GMT on 26 March adds: "Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa has said that a number of subjects, foremost 
of which was the Libyan-Western crisis, were discussed. He said 
the council will issue a resolution in this respect tomorrow. 
He said the subject of the Arab boycott against Israel has not 
yet been brought up before the council. 
  ["Ibrahim al-Bishari, Libya's permanent Arab League envoy, 
has stated that the seven-member Arab committee has made a 
proposal concerning the Libyan-Western crisis. It provides for 
arrangements maintaining Libya's sovereignty and responding to 
Security Council Resolution 731. He stressed that the next 
stage will see intensive diplomatic activity in this regard, 
whether by the Arab League or the seven-member committee."]

  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- Arab foreign ministers here 
Sunday [27 March] postponed action on US and other appeals to 
ease their 46-year-old trade boycott on Israel, amid anger over 
the Hebron massacre. 
  The ministers agreed to tackle the boycott issue, which had 
been on the agenda at the Arab League meeting due to end in 
Cairo Sunday, at their next session later in the year, 
participants said. 
  "The climate is not favorable for lifting the indirect 
boycott" on international firms dealing with Israel, because of 
the February 25 massacre, a diplomat close to the Arab League 
told AFP. 
  Two-thirds of the Arab League's 22 members would have to 
support such a move if it came to a vote. 
  Gulf states Oman and Qatar recently began "intensive 
efforts" 
to ease the embargo, but "this lobbying effort did not get the 
hoped-for results because of the Hebron massacre," the diplomat 
said. 
  "All the other Arab countries want to maintain the indirect 
boycott," according the diplomat, who asked that his name not be 
used. 
  Since the Israeli-PLO autonomy accord was signed on 
September 
13, Washington has called for the indirect boycott to be lifted 
in exchange for US participation in developing the Gaza Strip 
and West Bank town of Jericho, the first two areas earmarked for 
autonomy under the delayed accord. 
  For Syria the main issue was not the massacre of 30 
Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank 
town of Hebron. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said the boycott 
"cannot be lifted before Israel withdraws totally from occupied 
Arab territories and the Palestinians create their own state." 
  Syria made no distinction between the direct boycott of Arab 
trade with Israel and the indirect boycott, al-Shar' said. 
  Syria's official Tishrin newspaper said Sunday that Israel 
"had not broken off the negotiations with Arab parties, but it 
is also true it has made no step toward peace and made no effort 
to help the peace process succeed." 
  US Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown said in January that Arab 
League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid had promised to 
raise the issue of the indirect boycott at the ministerial 
meeting in Cairo. 
  As the session opened Saturday, 'Abd-al-Majid reiterated the 
Arab states' condemnation of the massacre, and calls for 
adequate international protection for Palestinians in the 
occupied territories. 
  Arab countries have boycotted Israel since it was created in 
1948. Three years later, they set up a body in charge of 
drawing up a "black list" of international firms with interests 
in Israel. 
  Barring Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 
1979, only Kuwait has lifted the indirect boycott, last year. 
  The Arab League also postponed debate on creating an Arab 
court of justice and amending the league's charter, participants 
said.

  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih met his 
Egyptian 
counterpart, 'Amr Musa. The meeting tackled issues of mutual 
concern, said Musa, stressing that there will be meeting between 
him and abu salih in khartoum in the near future. Musa affirmed 
Egypt's firm stand against the separation of Sudan. 
  Dr. Abu-Salih hoped that official dialogue between Sudan and

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
made a statement following President Husni Mubarak's meeting 
with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' today. He said that 
al-Shar' briefed the president on the latest developments in the 
peace process, the Arab League meeting, several issues of joint 
Egyptian-Syrian interest, and the coordination of 
Egyptian-Syrian political moves in the context of collective 
Arab action and the resumption of the peace negotiations. 
  Asked about Syria's position on the U.S. President's recent 
remarks on Jerusalem, al-Shar' replied: Our views on this issue 
are known. Jerusalem is an inseparable part of the occupied 
Arab territories and is subject to the same principles governing 
the rest of the territories. 
  Al-Shar' affirmed that Israel must withdraw from all the 
occupied territories because the peace process began with the 
understanding that the pertinent UN resolutions would be 
implemented. He noted that these resolutions refer to Jerusalem. 
  Asked about Syria's position on resuming negotiations, 
al-Shar' pointed out that Syria's position on peace is clear and 
no international doubts remain about the necessity of attaining 
a just and comprehensive peace. 
  He added that resisting the occupation is a nation's 
legitimate right, which is only terminated by ending the 
occupation and is not subject to bargaining. 
  Asked why no meeting of the Arab cordon states was held on 
the sidelines of the Arab League Council session, the Syrian 
foreign minister remarked that actually no invitation was issued 
for such a meeting, but bilateral discussions were held on the 
sidelines of the Arab League conference. He added: We will 
continue these bilateral contacts and when the need for a 
meeting of the cordon states arises, we will use diplomatic 
channels to arrange one. 
  In response to a question whether any new developments had 
occurred in connection with the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, 
al-Shar' said there have been no new developments but there is 
now a better understanding and recognition of the importance of 
the Geneva summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Clinton in January and its results. He explained 
that this means there is now a better understanding of Syria's 
leading role in the peace process. 
  In connection with the recent U.S. announcement that it 
received a Syrian response about resuming the Syrian, Jordanian, 
and Lebanese negotiations with Israel in April, the Syrian 
foreign minister was asked to comment on the fact that the PLO 
was not mentioned in this announcement. He was asked if this 
meant a separation of the PLO's negotiating track from the other 
three. Al-Shar' replied: Syria has no plans, and I believe our 
Lebanese and Jordanian brothers have no plans either, to 
separate our negotiating tracks from the Palestinian track. 
  The Syrian foreign minister continued: Regrettably the 
opposite happened. Those in charge of the Palestinian track 
separated it from the other Arab tracks. This affair is 
well-known to the Arab citizens and in international circles too. 
  Al-Shar' pointed out that negotiations between the PLO and 
Israel have actually been resumed in Tunis and then in Cairo and 
will continue. He said the Palestinians did not coordinate this 
resumption of the talks with the other Arab parties concerned 
with the peace process. 
  He added: In Syria, of course, we attach great importance to 
coordination and will maintain our bilateral communications, 
especially with our Lebanese and Jordanian brothers. 
  Responding to a question on Israeli Prime Minister Rabin's 
recent statement on the need for Syria to show its genuine 
desire for peace to the Israeli people so that Israel may define 
the line from which it will withdraw from the Golan, al-Shar' 
said that withdrawal from the Golan is a lawful, legal, and 
binding demand according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 
338 and Article 25 of the UN Charter, which expressly calls for 
member countries' commitment to implementing Security Council 
resolutions. He stressed that Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
is not negotiable and, consequently, total withdrawal is a 
requirement that must be met in accordance with Resolutions 242 
and 338. He said: Despite this, Syria called for total peace 
in return for total withdrawal and we are waiting to hear 
similar talk from the Israelis, that is, to declare that they 
are ready for total withdrawal in return for total peace. 
  In reply to a question on Syria's position on the Arab 
boycott of Israel, al-Shar' said that the Arab boycott of Israel 
is a legal action and is in accordance with the Arab countries' 
declaration made as a result of the state of war between the 
Arab countries and Israel and Israeli occupation of Arab 
territories. He said that as long as the reasons for the 
boycott are valid, the Arab boycott will remain binding to the 
Arab countries collectively or individually. He stressed that it 
is wrong to request the Arabs to cancel the boycott while Israel 
continues to occupy Arab territory. Such a demand, he said, 
gives the impression that you ask me to cancel a legal and 
lawful decision to support an illegal and unlawful position, 
namely the occupation of land. He said: The boycott of Israel 
is legal and lawful but the occupation is illegal and unlawful.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq 
al-Shar' has declared that the Arab League Council adopted a 
resolution calling on the international community to put 
pressure on Israel to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
and place its nuclear weapons under international inspection. 
This, he added, falls within the context of the Arab states' 
demand to free the Middle East of nuclear weapons. 
  In a news conference he held this afternoon at the Arab 
League headquarters, al-Shar' said that the Arab League Council 
had agreed on a unified Arab position when the time comes to 
renew the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, so that Israel may 
not be excluded from signing this treaty. He noted that weapons 
of mass destruction are dangerous to pan-Arab security and, 
therefore, it is natural for the Arabs to defend their interests. 
  On the Arab position toward France following its recent 
agreement on military and security cooperation with Israel, 
al-Shar' said: We were surprised by the noticeable 
consolidation of French-Israeli ties recently and following the 
Israeli massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It came at a time 
when we are discussing the peace process and despite the fact 
that Israel possesses a large arsenal of all types of weapons 
and is occupying Arab lands, he added. Al-Shar' emphasized that 
the matter had been brought up during the meetings of the Arab 
League Council, which unanimously denounced this step as one 
that does not serve the peace process in the region and harms 
Arab-French ties, which were marked by friendship and balance. 
  The Syrian foreign minister noted that it had been agreed 
within the Arab League Council not to debate the issue of the 
Arab boycott of Israel during the current session. He stressed 
that the boycott cannot be lifted without Israel's withdrawal 
from the occupied Arab territories. He added: The boycott is a 
law, and the law is indivisible. Besides, there is no Arab 
decision to lift the boycott, and if some states have made 
unilateral decisions in this regard, this has nothing to do with 
the Arab League. 
  Discussing peace, al-Shar' said Syria rejects the 
step-by-step policy and seeks to achieve a comprehensive and 
just peace that will secure the Arabs' legitimate rights. He 
noted that Syria's stand stipulates that Jerusalem is part of 
the occupied Arab territories and Syria demands a complete 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for a comprehensive 
peace. 
  He said Israel has not yet agreed to this measure and he 
affirmed that, as long as the peace is not comprehensive, it 
will not lead to security and stability in the region. 
  He pointed out that the Arab League Council discussed the 
water issue and expressed its support for the Syrian stance on 
the Tigris an Euphrates Rivers, two international rivers to 
which international laws and norms apply. He said the council 
asked Syria to present legal and political studies on this 
problem because water security is vital to the Arab countries. 
  He added that the Arab League Council reviewed numerous 
problems facing the Arab countries, such as Iraq, Libya, Sudan, 
Yemen, Algeria, and Somalia. He noted that such discussion is a 
positive factor in openness among the Arabs to push things in 
the direction of Arab reconciliation. He said the Arab nation 
should not pause at the Gulf crisis and that it must work to 
remedy the current serious disorder.

  [Text] Cairo--The Arab League Council has resumed meetings 
at the Arab League General Secretariat's headquarters at the 
foreign ministers' level with the participation of [Syrian] 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'. 
  The Council held a morning session and an evening session 
yesterday, and addressed several topics on the agenda, led by 
the situation in the occupied Syrian Golan. The Council also 
discussed a draft resolution on the occupied Syrian Golan 
stressing the Council's rejection of all measures that the 
Israeli occupation authorities have taken and are taking with 
the aim of changing the legal, natural, and demographic 
situation of the occupied Syrian Golan. 
  The draft resolution reaffirms that the Israeli measures 
extending sovereignty to the Golan are illegal, null, and void, 
and that they violate both the international agreements and the 
UN Charter and resolutions, which emphasize that Israel's 
decision on 14 December 1981 to annex the occupied Syrian Golan 
is illegal, null, and void. The Knesset's decision, made on 11 
November 1991, in this regard, is also null and void and has no 
legal force. 
  In the draft resolution, the Council demands that the 
Security Council assume its responsibilities toward Israel's 
compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
These resolutions provide for both full withdrawal from the 
Syrian Golan and for supporting the Syrian Government in its 
efforts to implement these resolutions. 
  The draft resolution also calls on the international 
community, particularly the United States, to force Israel to 
comply with the UN and other international resolutions 
pertaining to full withdrawal from both the Golan and other 
occupied Arab territories. It stresses support for the 
steadfastness of the Syrian Arab citizens in the Golan in their 
confrontation of both the Israeli occupation and its repressive 
practices, and also for their insistence on adhering to both 
their territory and their Syrian Arab identity. 
  The draft resolution stresses the need to implement the 
Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 for the Syrian citizens in the 
occupied Golan. It renews the Arab states' emphasis of their 
firm support for Syria's just demands and right to regain the 
entire occupied Syrian Golan based on the peace process and the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, particularly Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338.

the multilateral talks will meet on 2 May in Doha, Qatar, adding 
that an invitation will be sent to Israel to attend the meeting.

during his meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id 
al-Sahhaf yesterday, he urged Iraq to implement the Security 
Council resolutions on the Gulf war so that the embargo imposed

to study Iraq's proposal to form a popular committee from the 
Gulf states to visit Iraq to resolve the problem of Kuwaiti 
prisoners there. The results of these contacts, he added, are 
not clear yet. 
  On reports that Qatar will extend a natural gas pipeline to 
Israel, the Qatari foreign minister said: The Israeli side has 
proposed this matter to us but we told them that we could not 
talk about it as long as Israel is occupying Arab territory.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--In a statement released today, 
the Arab League Council welcomed UN Security Council Resolution 
904 providing protection for the Palestinians. It called on the 
international community to pressure Israel to immediately 
implement the clauses of the resolution and provide 
international protection for the Palestinian people in the 
occupied Arab territories, including Jerusalem. 
  The Arab League Council called on the two cosponsors of the 
peace conference to shoulder their responsibilities to guarantee 
the safety of the Palestinian people and their property in the 
occupied territories and to prevent recurrence of the criminal 
acts committed by Jewish settlers and conspirators. The Arab 
League Council's 101st session hailed the Palestinian people's 
steadfastness under the occupation and their insistence on 
obtaining their freedom and continuing their steadfastness until 
the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from all the occupied 
Arab and Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem. The 
statement noted that the Arab League Council heard numerous 
statements and speeches regarding the ugly crime committed in 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron by Israeli settlers in 
suspicious collusion with Israeli Army units.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Arab diplomatic sources said 
today that the tension that has marred relations between Libya 
and the Arab League has been contained. The tension rose when 
Jum'ah al-Fazzani, secretary of the Libyan General People's 
Committee for Unity [title as received], announced that his 
country was thinking of withdrawing from the Arab League because 
of the latter's failure to solve Arab problems, including the 
Libyan-Western crisis. 
  The sources said that the desire shown by Ibrahim 
al-Bishari, 
Libya's permanent envoy to the Arab League, to head his 
country's delegation to the Arab League Council meetings was a 
clear signal that this tension is over. 
  The sources added that Libya is satisfied with the Arab 
League's stance on the Libyan-Western crisis and that the Libyan 
permanent envoy expressed his country's appreciation for the 
role played by the Arab League and the seven-member committee in 
solving this problem. 
  The sources went on to say that the Arab League secretary 
general played a vital role in the meeting of the seven-member 
committee and left his print on the resolution issued on the 
Libyan-Western crisis issued at the conclusion of the Arab 
League Council session, which emphasized the League's support 
for Libyan efforts to find a peaceful solution to this crisis.

  [Text] Kuwait [as received], 27 Mar (MENA)--Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, has praised the stand of the Egyptian leadership, 
Government, and people in support of Arab nations' causes and 
Egypt's responsibilities in this respect, especially its 
honorable and historic stand on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. 
  At a news conference held at the Arab League this evening on 
the sidelines of the Arab League Council meetings, he said Egypt 
rejected Iraqi aggression and launched the first formula of Arab 
legitimacy rejecting aggression and occupation. He added that 
Egypt's stand took shape in an effective participation in 
efforts to eliminate the effects of aggression. 
  He expressed his belief that the Security Council will not 
lift the sanctions imposed on Iraq as long as Iraq continues to 
disrespect Kuwait's independence and sovereignty, refuses to 
implement Security Council Resolution 833, refuses to repatriate 
Kuwaiti and other detainees, and refuses to return all property 
and compensate those affected by the aggression. 
  He said: We are all suffering because of the Iraqi people's 
suffering but we must emphasize that the one responsible for the 
continuation of this suffering is Iraq, which rejects 
international resolutions, particularly Security Council 
Resolutions 706 and 712, which provide food and medicine for the 
Iraqi people. 
  He added that Iraq is still threatening security and 
stability in the Gulf region and is far from fully implementing 
all articles of the Security Council resolutions on its 
aggression against Kuwait. He went on to say that Iraq 
procrastinates and is selective about these resolutions and is 
pursuing its repressive measures against its people. 
  Replying to a question on Kuwaiti detainees held in Iraq, he 
said the detainees' files that were forwarded to the 
International Red Cross were full and complete but Iraqi 
authorities did not allow the Red Cross to visit Iraq and search 
for the detainees. He turned down an Iraqi proposal to form a 
popular committee from the Gulf countries to visit Iraq for a 
fact-finding mission on the detainees. 
  He said Kuwait has done a great deal for Arab solidarity and 
it is not happy with the Arab world's current fractured 
situation. But, he added, the Kuwaiti people find it difficult 
to accept reconciliation with Iraq unless it implements all 
Security Council resolutions. 
  He noted that he intends to visit the Arab Maghreb countries 
soon to improve ties with them. He stressed Kuwait's identity 
and its Arab affiliation despite joint military maneuvers with 
Western countries. 
  He said Kuwait will sign a security accord with Russia as 
part of its efforts to sign security accords with the Security 
Council's permanent members. 
  The Kuwaiti foreign minister said his country has extended 
development aid for the Iraqi people in the north and south and 
affirmed that Kuwait does not favor the partition of Iraq. He 
said he has good ties with the Iraqi opposition but stressed 
that this does not mean an alliance with the opposition to 
overthrow the Iraqi regime. 
  He noted that Kuwait has lifted the boycott in the second 
and 
third degrees on companies that deal with Israel but affirmed 
that Kuwait will not lift the first-degree, direct boycott of 
Israel until after Israeli forces have withdrawn from the 
occupied Arab territories. He said his country is not prepared 
to host Israelis in the framework of the Middle East 
multilateral peace talks. 
  Answering a question on the demarcation of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti 
border, the Kuwaiti foreign minister said the territory that was 
given to Kuwait by the UN agreement did not result in the 
addition of a single inch of Iraqi land to Kuwait and, thus, 
Iraq lost nothing because this territory was originally Kuwaiti. 
  [In an earlier Cairo-datelined report of the news 
conference, 
Cairo MENA in Arabic at 1538 GMT on 27 March added: "Shaykh 
Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti first deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, announced that his country will host a conference of 
the Damascus Declaration countries in June."]

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (INA)--Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Al Thani has reiterated his country's firm stand on 
the need to lift the embargo imposed on the people of Iraq. 
Speaking to reporters in Cairo today on the sidelines of the 
Arab League Council meeting, the Qatari foreign minister said 
that relations with Iraq are going well and are continuously 
developing in the interest of the Iraqi and Qatari peoples and 
the Arab nation. 
  Answering a question by an INA correspondent in Cairo on 
Qatar's stand vis-a-vis the attempts to prolong the embargo 
imposed on Iraq, the Qatari foreign minister said that Qatar is 
working toward ending the suffering of the Iraqi people as soon 
as possible because we cannot remain silent about the effects of 
the sanctions, adding that it is in the interest of the nation 
to end this situation. 
  The Qatari minister said that he met with [Iraqi] Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf and discussed with him issues 
related to lifting the blockade imposed on the people of Iraq, 
noting that Iraqi-Qatari relations have never ceased. 
  The Qatari minister said that Qatar is playing an Arab role 
to bring closer the viewpoints of the Arab parties and brothers 
everywhere in the interest of the nation's solidarity and 
strength.

  [Text] The Arab League Ministerial Council is scheduled to 
end its meetings of the 101st session held at the Arab League 
headquarters in Cairo tonight. In a telephone conversation with 
our newsdesk correspondent Suhayl Khuri, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, who is taking part in 
these meetings, spoke about the results of this session: 
  [Begin recording] [Khuri] Good evening Your Excellency. 
  [Al-Hasan] Good evening. 
  [Khuri] What results did you achieve during the meetings of 
the Arab League Ministerial Council in Cairo? 
  [Al-Hasan] During the four meetings held yesterday and 
today, the Arab League Council discussed a number of important 
issues and reviewed the agenda items. Foremost of these issues 
were the Palestinian cause and developments in the peace 
process. Moreover, the ministers discussed the horrific Israeli 
crime perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the middle of 
the holy month of Ramadan and its following coercive measures 
against the defenseless Palestinian citizens. 
  At the council, I explained His Majesty King Husayn's 
immediate efforts in the wake of this crime and the Jordanian 
Government's measures and contacts. Through these measures and 
contacts, the Jordanian Government expressed its clear 
condemnation of this crime, held Israel fully responsible, 
demanded that the international community shoulder its 
responsibilities and force Israel to provide necessary 
international protection for the Palestinian people, and 
stressed that racist settlement building and settlements must be 
removed as they represent an obstacle to peace. 
  The council also reviewed developments in the peace process 
and the resolutions we adopted in the past to support this 
process since it is a strategic Arab choice to solve the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  The council discussed joint Arab action. It decided to 
postpone making decisions on the issue of pan-Arab security. 
Jordan had presented a detailed study on this issue during the 
council's previous session proceeding from Jordan's concern 
about this issue and since it is considered a priority issue. 
The council also decided to postpone the issue of amending the 
Arab League's charter because it is closely linked to the issue 
of pan-Arab security. 
  [Khuri] When do you expect the Ministerial Council to end 
its discussion of the agenda items and issue a final statement? 
  [Al-Hasan] Of course, the council will hold a meeting in a 
short while to review all the decisions after the committees 
have ended their meetings. The council will hold a general 
session to review all these decisions. 
  [Khuri] Your Excellency: How do you assess the atmosphere 
of the Ministerial Council's meetings? 
  [Al-Hasan] I can say that this meeting was positive. 
  [Khuri] Thank you Your Excellency. 
  [Al-Hasan] You are welcome. [end recording]

concluded its 101st session tonight following two days of

al-Jamahiriyah in its crisis with the West, and commitment to 
the Arabism of Jerusalem.

  [Text] The Arab League Council concluded tonight its 101st 
session, which was held under the chairmanship of Yemeni Foreign 
Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah, at Arab League headquarters . 
  Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid held 
a 
news conference, in which he stressed that the session was 
eventful and beneficial. He said that there is Arab interest 
and the highest level of coordination in making the Middle East 
region free from weapons of mass destruction. He added that 
there is a unified Arab concept on reassessing the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty during 1995. 
  He also said that the council decided to lift the boycott of 
Liberian companies that were on the boycott list. 
  On the obstacles impeding Arab reconciliation, he said that 
the issue is still under study and, despite the passage of one 
year since this issue was raised, it still needs some time in 
view of the consequences of the Gulf crisis. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that some Arab countries' demand to 
amend the Arab League Charter does not mean closing the door on 
his initiative to set up the Arab Court of Justice and achieve 
Arab reconciliation. 
  On Jerusalem, he said that the Arab League has reiterated 
its 
firm stand on the Arabism of Jerusalem and the inalienable Arab 
rights and that efforts are now being held at the highest levels 
on current Arab issues, such as Somalia, Yemen, and the 
Libyan-Western crisis. In this respect, he praised President 
Husni Mubarak's efforts to attain a peace declaration between 
the Somali factions. 
  On Arab water security, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab 
foreign ministers discussed this issue carefully and decided to 
have more studies on the protection of Arab waters.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that the 101st session of the 
Arab League Council was eventful and was characterized by the 
very high-level presence of foreign ministers. He added that 
the session dealt with a number of political, economic, legal, 
and financial issues that concern Arab countries. 
  Speaking at a news conference tonight following the 
conclusion of the session, he said that this two-day session was 
held at a very sensitive and critical time dominated by the 
consequences of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid underlined the Arab League's desire to 
give 
impetus to the comprehensive and just peace process in the 
Middle East. He also underlined the Arab League's commitment to 
the Arabism of Jerusalem and said that this issue will never be 
relinquished. 
  He explained that the Arab League Secretariat General issued 
a statement several days ago expressing concern over reports 
about new U.S. statements that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
He noted that the U.S. Embassy in Cairo has denied these 
statements and stressed Washington's firm stance on the 
Jerusalem issue. 
  The Arab League secretary general said that the issue of 
amending the League's charter has been postponed because of the 
differences in the views of the member states on this issue. He 
explained that identical views were required on the concept of 
the amendment proposed by the Arab League's secretariat general, 
but this does not mean that the amendment has been rejected. He 
called for respecting the views of all the Arab parties, adding: 
Differences in views do not spoil an issue. 
  Regarding his initiative on Arab reconciliation, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid said that it is now being studied. He added that 
he got the feeling from the ministers participating in the 
session that they accept the reconciliation proposal but that 
the matter will require more time because the Iraqi invasion of 
Kuwait in August 1990 has left a painful wound. 
  He said that he raised the following question: Since we are 
facing an Arab-Israeli reconciliation, hasn't the time come for 
holding an inter-Arab reconciliation? 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid urged patience on the issue of Arab 
reconciliation and expressed his belief that it will happen in 
the future. He noted that no one spoke about Arab 
reconciliation a year ago but it is now on every tongue and has 
become a theme of a number of intellectual seminars. He said 
that the Egyptian paper AL-AHRAM will soon host a seminar on 
this issue. 
  Regarding the Arab League's stance on the Libyan-Western 
crisis, the secretary general said that the seven-member 
committee charged with discussing this crisis met on the 
sidelines of the council's session and discussed the 
developments. He added that the council felt Libya's desire to 
find a solution that will be compatible with international law 
and preserve that country's dignity and sovereignty. He said 
that the Arab League Council backed the Libyan proposal that the 
two suspects in the Lockerbie incident be tried before the 
International Court of Justice in the Hague with Scottish judges 
sitting on the bench and Scottish laws, which are more flexible 
than British ones, applied. 
  He described this proposal as practical and emphasized 
Libya's flexibility in solving the crisis, adding that no 
country hands over its citizens to another country to be tried 
there. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the council decided to lift the 
boycott imposed on Liberia because of its dealings with Israel. 
  He said that the League Council decided to draw up a 
comprehensive Arab concept on setting up a zone free from 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region, which 
will be submitted to the League Council at its 102nd session 
scheduled to be held at Arab League headquarters. 
  He said that the Islamic Republic of Comorro asked that the 
next session be held there, but no decision has been made on 
this matter.

  [Text] In Constantine today, Salim Saadi, minister of 
interior and local authorities, presided over the proceedings of 
a regional meeting which brought together, alongside the 
ministerial delegation, 15 governors of eastern Algeria and a 
number of local officials representing various social and 
professional sectors. During this meeting, which was held in the 
Mohamed Laid al-Khalifa Cultural Center, the interior minister 
delivered an address devoted to security issues and the means 
and facilities the state has made available and continues to 
provide in order to eliminate the phenomenon of armed violence 
aimed at the citizens, security men, and state institutions. 
Abdelwahab Zeid, from the Constantine radio station, gives us 
the most important points of the interior minister's address: 
  [Zeid] Mr. Saadi stressed the fresh measures taken at all 
levels and designed to ensure that we stand as one, facing up 
with determination and firmness to all maneuvers aimed at 
Algeria, its people, and its government. He underlined the need 
for citizens to mobilize, each in his own position, to defend 
the gains of the liberation revolution [of 1954] and the state 
institutions which belong to the people, and the future of its 
sons and coming generations. 
  [Begin Saadi recording] From the experiences of the last 
year or two in fighting this disaster we have drawn lessons on 
the need to review the fight against this phenomenon, either by 
way of renewing our methods of fighting or changing our ways of 
using these methods. Such a review makes us aware that we will 
be entering a new era of mobilizing more material and human 
resources and improving the methods of our fight to make them 
more effective. We have started this process, and you are going 
to see it on the ground in the future. However, the problems of 
security and the fight against terrorism should not remain 
solely the task of the security men. The security men are now 
in the service of the people, and the people should therefore 
increase their participation in helping the security men. 
  We know that there are conditions that must be available, 
for 
example, (?legal) conditions. We are going to make these 
conditions available, because we are going to ensure the 
presence of the minimum necessary force in every municipality, 
everywhere, to secure a general cover [applause interrupting]. 
  Let us now speak about another subject, through which we are 
going to give our reply to those in charge of public 
enterprises. We have taken measures to ensure that these 
enterprises, which belong to the people, are protected by their 
own workers. This means people will be appointed to assume this 
task. If we are sometimes unable to find people with the 
necessary qualities from within the enterprises, then people 
will be recruited from outside the enterprise to provide the 
necessary protection for the enterprise and its assets. But we 
cannot leave these enterprises open to sabotage. [end recording]

armed violence against citizens, security men, and state 
institutions. 
  While chairing a regional meeting, which included 15

  [Excerpt] Most of the publicly-owned and independent 
newspapers cease publication today and tomorrow. This decision 
was made directly by the publishers following the armed attack 
on the premises of the L'HEBDO LIBERE weekly last Monday. 
  The attack led to the killing of a cameraman and one worker 
and the serious wounding of three other. The weekly's sources 
had said that one of the wounded, Nadir Mahmoudi, brother of the 
L'HEBDO LIBERE's director, died of his wounds. The papers 
involved are EL WATAN, EL MOUDJAHID, El HAQ, LA GAZETTE, 
CONFIDENCE, OLYMPIQUE, ALGER REPUBLICAIN, L'ECHO DU CENTRE and 
other newspapers. 
  This is the first time national newspapers are to cease 
publication for two consecutive days in protest against repeated 
armed attacks on journalists and media men. 
  The security issue, which is an aspect of the political 
crisis the country has experienced for over two years, is a 
source of concern for the government. The series of 
negotiations President Liamine Zeroual has been holding is 
expected to resume this week in the framework of the dialogue he 
had started since the beginning of last week aimed at seeking 
the best means to overcome the current crisis the country is 
experiencing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, March 27 (AFP) -- Egyptian doctors said 
Sunday the victims of the Hebron mosque massacre were hit by 
three types of bullets proving Jewish settler Baruch Goldstein 
had not acted alone. 
  The team of doctors, who visited Hebron shortly after last 
month's massacre, told the Egyptian daily AL-AHRAM "three types 
of bullets and splinters were extracted" from the bodies of the 
wounded. 
  "That proves the massacre was not carried out by one 
person," 
they told the paper. 
  The Israeli army has insisted Goldstein acted alone when he 
opened fire on February 25 in the mosque killing 30 Arab 
worshippers. 
  Israeli ballistics experts have said that all those wounded 
and killed were hit by bullets from a Galil short-barrelled gun. 
  But witnesses at the official inquiry into the massacre have 
testified that they saw another armed settler with Goldstein, 
and that two soldiers also fired at people and not just in the 
air as the army has maintained. 
  One 12-year-old boy told the inquiry that copper splinters 
were taken from his back, lending weight to claims that a 
grenade was used. 
  A separate PLO inquiry recently concluded that at least two 
soldiers had shot at Moslems at prayer in the West Bank mosque. 
  The official Israeli inquiry is still hearing evidence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan al-Hillawi by Khalid Salah in Turah </F>
Prison in Cairo; date not given -- first paragraph is AL-`ARABI 
introduction] 
  [Text] Al-Hillawi is one of the founders of the so-called 
Islamic Jihad Movement. He joined the Nabil Bura'i-led 
organization in 1967. Ayman al-Zawahiri was also one of the 
group's cadres. Al-Hillawi was the fourth defendant in the case 
known as the Technical Military Academy case in 1974 but he was 
acquitted. He then participated in establishing an organization 
that attacked a foreign consulate in Alexandria in 1977. 
Al-Hillawi was sentenced to seven years. But he escaped and 
spent 16 years abroad. It was reported then that he was one of 
the major financiers of terrorist operations in Egypt. He was 
arrested by the Saudi intelligence service in May and is now a 
guest of the Turah Prison. We met him there. He said he had 
renounced terrorism. He declared his new ideas renouncing 
terrorism and refuting the ideas of those who kill innocent men, 
women, and children. 
  [Salah] What are the motives behind your statements 
condemning terrorism and lashing out at the group of which you 
were a principal founder? 
  [Al-Hillawi] My main motive was that I wanted to defend the 
true image of Islam. The current actions of these groups, which 
they attribute to Islam, distort the image of Islam and the 
Muslims. It is one of my religious duties -- I am a graduate of 
the al-Azhar University -- to tell the truth and show that these 
actions are not linked with the pure religion, Islam. 
  These groups, which carry out acts of violence, should not 
be 
attributed to Islam. True, we called on people in the past to 
abide by and defend religion but we never asked them to form 
organizations or jihad. At first, we called for jihad in 
defense of Egypt, not to spread corruption in it. Religion 
demands that we carry out jihad to promote the country and 
defend sanctities. Jihad is not sowing discords or shedding 
blood unjustly. That is sedition. How could I kill Muslims or 
even non-Muslims who are defenseless and who are not our 
enemies? How could I kill them and still call it jihad? That 
is a crime. 
  [Salah] Is it not strange for you to say this when you were 
one of the founders of this movement and the principal financier 
when you were abroad? 
  [Al-Hillawi] I took part in founding the movement that 
called 
for real jihad, not for shedding blood falsely. How could we 
approach the people now with their hearts imbued with 
indignation after satan sowed sedition and used some groups 
affiliated with Islam? How could we face the people now that 
every bearded person and every veiled person reflects the image 
of a treacherous killer? As for the talk about me financing 
these groups, this is wrong. It has never taken place. 
  [Salah] But what made you stay quiet all these years? What 
made you declare these new ideas after your arrest? Were you 
subjected to specific pressures, for example? 
  [Al-Hillawi] I was not silent. But travel enabled me to 
survey the situation carefully. I wrote a book in which I 
refuted their ideas. I recorded this opinion and several 
sermons made in Saudi Arabia on tape. I swear that my writings 
and announcements were not shaped under pressure. I also swear 
that I offered nothing in return for my release from prison. 
All my ideas have been prompted by what I have seen of ugly 
actions, which they attribute to Islam falsely. I know they say 
I have become weak and sick. But this is not true. It is only 
the horror that is inflicted on every preacher and ourselves by 
the shedding of the blood of Muslims or non-Muslims. God 
forbids such actions. 
  [Salah] In your view, what has led these groups to all this 
violence and terrorism? 
  [Al-Hillawi] They have never consulted the ulema but 
followed 
their own deficient interpretations until they reached the 
current state of confusion. Had they gone back to the scholars 
and those who issue religious decrees in Egypt, they would not 
have reached this state. 
  They sought their own interpretations although they are not 
qualified to do so and cited legal religious texts in the wrong 
situations. For example, they kill innocent people with their 
explosions and assassinations and then say they did not mean to 
kill them. If we ask them what these people did to be killed, 
they would reply that they were killed by mistake and that the 
killers will be made to answer and judged by God according to 
their intentions. Take the verse: "If any do fail to judge by 
(the light of) what God hath revealed, they are (no better than) 
wrongdoers" [Koranic verse]. This is the verse on which they 
establish most of their ideas and deeds. They became so general 
in their interpretation that they thought simply that they are 
the Muslims and the rest are infidels. This is wrong because 
the correct interpretation of the verse is that any one who does 
not accept God's rule, thinks there is a better rule, and says 
so is an infidel. But even the rulers of Egypt and Arab and 
Islamic countries do not say this. Everyone, including the 
rulers, knows that Islamic shari'ah is the greatest and most 
revered thing. They always declare this but believe that there 
are circumstances that impede its implementation to the full. 
Such circumstances may be acceptable to some and not to others 
and this is something that should be interpreted, because it is 
a contentious issue and no judgment can be passed on it in this 
unjust manner. 
  [Salah] They do not only level charges against the rulers 
but 
also describe the entire state as ignorant. 
  [Al-Hillawi] This is an erroneous statement because Imam 
al-Shafi'i [late Muslim scholar] said every country conquered by 
Muslims will remain an Islamic state until doomsday. How can 
this be said today? All the Arab countries are Islamic and the 
people in them are Muslims and non-Muslims, as is the case in 
every society where there is good and bad. Even these societies 
include the reformer and the corrupt and the believer and the 
hypocrite. Everyone is judged by his deeds. Egyptian society in 
particular is an Islamic one and no one can say it is not. 
  [Salah] Do you have an alternative to the call for change 
under these circumstances? 
  [Al-Hillawi] I have no Islamic line except to follow the 
ulema and listen to them. Talk of senior ulema must be heeded. 
As for gathering around youths who have imperfect culture and 
think they truly understand religion, any act they commit is 
imperfect and closer to ignorance. All Muslims must follow the 
renowned ulema who are known for their knowledge and piety. 
  [Salah] Do you think the groups that practice violence in 
Egypt are financed by foreign states? 
  [Al-Hillawi] God knows. Some quarters may want to harm 
popular activity in Egypt. I wonder from where those groups 
brought the money and weapons. Undoubtedly, some individuals or 
groups have an interest in spoiling our affairs. I believe 
there are many sources of finance but I have no details. 
  [Salah] Are there people in the movement who have begun to 
accept the ideas and joined your call? 
  [Al-Hillawi] Yes, thank God. There are hundreds, including 
'Abd-al-Nasir Durrah, who was one of the suspects in al-Jihad 
incidents in 1981 and who was sentenced to five years in prison. 
The number is increasing daily. Hundreds of members abroad are 
convinced. But there is a need to spread the call and expand 
the new understanding. Those people felt they were breaking 
free of wrong concepts and realizing that right is different 
from what they thought. Many young men who effectively 
understood the truth have begun to explain things to others and 
to call them to the right path. If we are given a better 
chance, these groups' problems will be solved, God willing. 
  [Salah] What is your comment on recent political 
assassinations and attacks against tourism committed upon orders 
from leaders abroad? 
  [Al-Hillawi] Like the Islamic ulema, I see in them a kind of 
corruption on earth; they are religiously unacceptable. Not one 
religious scholar condones this corruption. It is against the 
shari'ah and a product of inept, misleading minds. I think 
those movements were good at first. But I ask them now: Are 
you emulating any model from our virtuous early Muslims? I 
challenge them to say yes. 
  [Salah] You said the ulema have a role to play in expanding 
the understanding of religion but those groups do not recognize 
the ulema; they refuse to listen to them and they describe them 
as government ulema. 
  [Al-Hillawi] Their talk of government ulema is wrong and 
misleading. Egypt is full of honest and virtuous ulema. If 
they do not listen to the advice of the ulema, they will 
continue to listen to the ignorant and their sedition will 
continue. Of course, there is a problem here, because they view 
themselves as mujahidin, and their dead as martyrs. They 
consider their displacement a kind of a patience along the road 
of jihad. This is a real problem. It is our duty to be patient 
with them and to lead them to the right path. 
  [Salah] How? 
  [Al-Hillawi] What is happening in Egypt is a kind of 
sedition 
among Muslims; there must be a conciliation and a truce. There 
must be room for dialogue and the ulema must have the chance to 
explain what is right and to calmly let those people know that 
they are far removed from God's shari'ah. If they still reject 
this explanation, this understanding, and this willingness for 
reform, then they must be confronted with all the methods they 
deserve! We discuss the issue from a religious point of view; 
we discuss religious texts and how they should be understood. 
If they answer in a political or an argumentative manner, then 
their arguments are unacceptable. I knew that some of them, 
such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, wanted to respond to my statements. 
Al-Zawahiri is a man of medicine, a surgeon who is not 
specialized in religious texts; let him talk about medicine, not 
religion. If he mixes medical surgery with religious texts, the 
bleeding will be endless. I tell al-Zawahiri: Fear God. 
Enough corruption on earth. 
  [Salah] Aren't you afraid of an attempted assassination in 
the context of their desire to continue the violence under the 
slogan of "preserving the propagation?" 
  [Al-Hillawi] They know I say this out of love and concern 
for 
them. There is no hatred between us and I explain to them what 
is right and that what they are doing has benefited no one 
except the enemies of Islam and Egypt both inside the country 
and abroad. 
  By the way, I was subject to an assassination attempt at the 
hands of Shukri Mustafa, the founder of the Repudiation and 
Renunciation Group, inside jail 18 years ago. God saved me. I 
believe the devil might applaud them for this act but it will 
only bring them evil in this world and punishment in the next. 
I am not afraid of saying what is right. Almighty God says: 
"Ye who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to 
God, even as against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin" 
[Koranic verse] 
  [Salah] Do you think the Kaliphate system applies now? 
  [Al-Hillawi] This is one of the shari'ah's duties and the 
way 
to this is as the ulema define. But the Muslim ulema did not 
speak about this clearly and we follow them. It is a duty, if 
possible, like pilgrimage. If it is not possible, God does not 
demand that anyone do what is beyond his capability. 
  Numerous groups advocated the reinstatement of the Kaliphate 
system and the call was right. But who gave them the mandate to 
set up such groups for this purpose? This is a violation of the 
rights of all Muslims and such a mandate cannot be used without 
consulting the authoritative people. Establishing groups to 
achieve this goal is impermissible, even the Muslim Shaykh 
Ibn-Taymiyah [former prominent Islamic scholar] did not call for 
setting up such groups. How do you compare such groups with the 
organizations of Ibn- Taymiyah, Imam al-Shafi'i, and Ahmad 
Bin-Hanbal [former Islamic scholars]? I reiterate to them: 
"Show me just one similarity with the deeds of the good 
ancestors." Where are the organizations of the prophet's 
companions, imams, and ancestors? These are ideas they grasped 
as they emulated other world organizations, while Islam does not 
advocate this at all. 
  [Salah] Do you intend to continue advocating these ideas 
after you leave prison? 
  [Al-Hillawi] I intend to continue until the young men know 
their rights and duties. I will flatter no one in this regard 
-- be they senior officials, rash youths, or any others. 
Returning to what is right is better than pursuing ignorance 
and confusion and I implore God to guide these people to 
righteousness. 
  [Salah] Do you believe they still have the strength to 
continue? 
  [Al-Hillawi] I believe many of them will soon realize what 
is 
right and anyone who remains outside this genuine understanding 
will have no value or effect. 
  [Salah] How do your inmates who are members of these groups 
treat you in prison? 
  [Al-Hillawi] Thanks be to God, all those I have spoken to 
were convinced by the talk. I asked some factions to introduce 
their ulema and cadres so that they might be confronted but they 
were afraid of such confrontation and rejected debate and 
discussion. 
  [Salah] Do these factions include anyone you believe to be 
more right and closer to understanding? 
  [Al-Hillawi] These factions are many and all their 
differences and disputes resemble pre-Islamic contentions. They 
are personal and tribal. The best one is the one who decides to 
heed only the words of the ulema.

<F P=106> [The "Closeup" column by Salamah Ahmad Salamah: "A U.S. </F>
Explanation Is Required"] 
  [Text] Has the U.S. Government under President Bill 
Clinton's administration changed its position on Jerusalem 
without making a candid declaration and without the Arab 
governments discovering this? Can we be content with the 
statement by Timothy Wirth, the State Department adviser on 
population affairs [title as published], in which he said that 
the statement citing President Clinton on Jerusalem was 
distorted and that the U.S. stance has not changed. This stance 
means that the fate of Jerusalem must be negotiated. Why wasn't 
this statement or correction made by the White House or the U.S. 
State Department, which are the parties concerned with 
explaining stances relating to foreign issues? 
  The successive U.S. Administrations have adopted a clear 
position on the issue of Jerusalem, which, from the Arab point 
of view, is considered to be one of the most important issues 
triggering the Arab-Israeli conflict. This issue will remain a 
bone of contention unless a settlement is reached guaranteeing 
the Arab rights in this holy city and preserving freedoms for 
religions there without relinquishing the religious and 
political rights of its Arab and Muslim population. 
  In all the negotiations and talks since the signing of the 
Camp David Accords, the U.S. stance on the Jerusalem problem has 
remained firm: Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories. 
The disputing parties should settle things through 
negotiations. Accordingly, the American Embassy has remained in 
Tel Aviv and has not moved to Jerusalem. During the U.S. 
presidential election campaign, Bill Clinton made statements in 
which he pledged that Jerusalem would be the capital of Israel. 
The Arab world did not bother much about these statements and 
considered them to be electoral promises the value of which 
would end with the election result. But at his recent meeting 
with AIPAC's [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] senior 
figures, President Clinton seized the opportunity to emphasize 
that the United States considers united Jerusalem the capital of 
Israel, thus violating all previous U.S. stances. 
  Regrettably, President Clinton's statement has not aroused 
enough attention among the Arabs. No Islamic or Arab country 
requested an explanation or clarification of the new position, 
which followed the Hebron massacre and came when the peace 
efforts were stumbling. The only comment was made by Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, who declared that if this statement 
means a new U.S. policy toward Jerusalem, Egypt differs with it. 
The question now is: Has the United States changed its 
position on Jerusalem? Does the U.S. abstention from voting on 
the clause on Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution 
reflect a new stance? This is the required clarification.

<F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "Unconditional Return"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In an unprecedented challenge to the feelings of 
Arabs and Muslims, U.S. President Bill Clinton stood up to 
declare that the United States regards Jerusalem as the unified 
capital of the State of Israel. It appears that the United 
States is not content with its full bias toward Israel and with 
guaranteeing its military superiority over all the Arabs. Not 
content with impeding -- for three weeks following the massacre 
in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron -- a Security Council 
resolution condemning the massacre and providing protection for 
the Palestinian people, it wants to reward the killers by 
declaring that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
  Such a grave declaration attributed to the U.S. President is 
a precedent in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The official stance 
of every U.S. Administration -- Republican or Democrat -- as 
evidenced by documents has stipulated that the status of 
Jerusalem and its future can be decided only within the 
framework of negotiations between all the parties and as part of 
the final, comprehensive, and just settlement in the Middle 
East. This stance has been in force throughout recent years, 
since the establishment of the State of Israel. 
  Now, with a frankness that can only be envied, the U.S. 
President comes to declare his new stance that Jerusalem is the 
unified capital of Israel. He then pledged to impede any 
Security Council resolution condemning the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre if it included or even hinted that Jerusalem is part of 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  This U.S. stance was confirmed after Washington refused to 
agree to a clause in the Security Council resolution issued the 
day before yesterday pointing out that Jerusalem is an occupied 
Palestinian territory. 
  It appears that President Clinton, whose popularity has 
started to wane at a time when he is suffering from the 
"Whitewater" scandal in which he and his wife are accused of 
using their influence to profit and avoid paying taxes, wants to 
win over the Jewish pressure groups in the United States. So he 
has shown no regard for the feelings of Arabs and Muslims, not 
to mention their legitimate rights. And why not? The Arabs 
have been deprived of everything, even the ability to protest. 
And why not, when the peace efforts are stalling and have 
resulted in nothing more than retreats and concessions by the 
Arabs to Israel in return for endless U.S. rewards to Israel 
from the Arabs' pockets and at the Arabs' own expense? [passage 
omitted] 
  This U.S. stance on Israel and the massacre that the whole 
world condemned is not simply one of a complete defense of 
Israel, but also one of pressure on the Palestinian leadership 
to return to the Oslo Agreement and the negotiations and abandon 
any popular demand to amend the Oslo Agreement or propose new 
items on the agenda. 
  Warren Christopher told the Palestinian president quite 
clearly: Return to the negotiations unconditionally. He wants 
the Palestinians to surrender to Israel unconditionally. 
  It remains for us to say: Don't these changes in the U.S. 
stance require a call for an emergency Arab summit at the Arab 
League headquarters in Cairo to face a stance that not only 
affects the Palestinians, but also the entire Arab nation? If 
an Arab summit is not held now when the Arab-Israeli conflict is 
entering a critical stage, then when can such a summit be held? 
All the Arab regimes, not just the Palestinians, are 
responsible for halting the slide in the Arab stance.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamadah Imam and Yasir Zari': "With Government </F>
Permission, Egypt's Security on the Table of the U.S. 
Intelligence Community"] 
  [Text] The result of an opinion poll on the prospects for 
security in Egypt in 1994 was sent to the Gallup Institute in 
Washington last week. The poll was conducted by "Radar 
Eastridge," a research and public relations firm, which secured 
a permit from the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics 
[CAMS]. The permit, numbered 1315/1993, was published in the 
Official Gazette on 6 December 1993. 
  The U.S. poll, conducted over three months, covered a sample 
of 8,000 citizens. The Egyptian and foreign researchers focused 
on poor neighborhoods, especially in al-Jizah and Asyut 
Governorates, in contravention of a CAMS decision stipulating 
that the survey be confined to a sample of 300 citizens in Cairo 
Governorate, distributed as follows: Some 230 from Heliopolis, 
al-Zaytun, al-Alf Maskan, Hada'iq al-Qubbah, al-Shurabiyah, 
al-Minyal, Madinat Nasr, Shubra, al-Dhahir, and al-'Abbasiyah 
and 70 citizens from al-Jizah Governorate, specifically from the 
areas of al-Muhandisin, al-Duqqi, Mit 'Uqbah, and the Pyramids. 
  The CAMS decision stressed that the citizens be told the 
survey is confidential and that data be gathered in accordance 
with an approved form prepared for this purpose. It also 
stipulated that only Egyptian researchers may gather the data 
and banned the participation of foreigners. The CAMS decision 
also stipulated that it receive two copies of the field study on 
completion before its handover to the quarter that commissioned 
it. CAMS would then hand the survey to that quarter. 
  Radar Eastridge did not abide by the CAMS conditions and did 
not secure the necessary permits from the security and 
administrative departments. It sent the poll result to Gallup 
to analyze it. Gallup is a private commercial firm selling its 
surveys to whoever pays the right price. Most of its contracts 
are with the CIA. The Gallup Institute recently conducted an 
opinion poll in Israel on the Jewish youth view and stance on 
the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
  AL-'ARABI has learned that a team of experts from Tel Aviv 
University's (Shilwah) Center is analyzing the results of 
another opinion poll conducted in the Governorates of Cairo, 
al-Jizah, and Alexandria. This poll was conducted by the 
Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and based on a sample of 
Egyptians, most notably intellectuals, politicians, and 
scientists. The poll focused on upcoming expected developments 
in light of the role of the political Islam current and the 
strength of the Nasirite current in Egypt. 
  In early January, the Israeli Academic Center received three 
researchers from the Truman Institute on Peace Research, which 
is affiliated with the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. This is 
within the framework of comprehensive research by a team of 30 
researchers from the institute who will study the "impact of 
Islam on African policies." The Truman Institute's African 
Research Unit is planning to conduct a new study on the "radical 
Islamic current groups" and those that are most likely to reach 
power. The study will begin in June when a new team of 
researchers will arrive to conduct an opinion poll with the 
assistance of the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, which has 
close links with the Israeli intelligence service Mosad.

<F P=106> [Report by Midhat al-Zahid: "An American Watergate in Egypt; </F>
the CIA Taps Senior Officials and Party Leaders' Telephone 
Communications"] 
  [Text] AL-AHALI has obtained information confirming that 
the American apparatuses used computer programs and phone 
tapping to spy on senior officials in state departments and on 
party leaders. 
  The American Reliance Company, which helped set up the 
unified telephone network in greater Cairo and Alexandria, 
established an information line between the Egyptian Telephone 
Exchange network and the central computer in the United States. 
The line could be used to tap the telephone communications of 
various ministries, parties, trade unions, and different 
subscribers. 
  In unifying the network, the American company Reliance 
depended on a central computer in which data concerning 
subscribers was stored on floppy disks connected with sets in 
every telephone exchange. These programs could be used to cut 
in on subscribers for testing and for other purposes, such as 
listening in. 
  The programs are started by a specific signal that could be 
sent from some distance from the United States using the 
information line between the Egyptian Telephone Exchange and the 
American central computer. With slight changes, signals could 
be received indicating that the line of the subscriber they want 
to tap is busy. Thus the telephone conversation can be taped. 
  The CIA tapped President Husni Mubarak's telephone calls 
during the Achille Lauro crisis, contrary to reports circulated 
at the time that bugs were planted in the president's office. 
  The devices were also used in taping Palestinian leader 
Yasir 
'Arafat's telephone calls on the settlement talks. The 
recordings were used in an attempt to show that the Palestinian 
stance was racist. 
  According to information, the National Telecommunications 
Authority had started to implement measures to guarantee secrecy 
and prevent the use of devices and advanced technologies that 
seek to serve subscribers for purposes other than those for 
which they were designed, particularly activities that threaten 
Egyptian national security.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--The Communications Ministry 
stressed that the report published today by the newspaper 
AL-AHALI claiming that some intelligence services are tapping 
the telephone lines of some officials and political party 
leaders is completely baseless. 
  In a statement issued today, a ministry source said that 
there is absolutely no truth to reports that the 
computer-operated centers for receiving reports on faulty 
telephone lines, which the National Communications Authority has 
established, are being used to obtain information on the 
subscriber's line when reporting a fault. The source stressed 
that the line is tested in order to ascertain the type and 
location of the fault and to automatically record it so that the 
repair teams can correct the fault and restore the line to 
operations. 
  The source added that Egyptian engineers and technicians are 
in charge of these centers, that no person other than those 
working there are allowed in, and that there are no foreign 
experts working in these centers. 
  The statement went on to say that the fault-reporting 
centers 
are completely secure and no telephone line can be tapped while 
engaged. It added that there are no contacts or links between 
these centers and any foreign entity and this confirms that the 
Egyptian network cannot be technically penetrated. 
  The statement noted that the role of the company carrying 
out 
the work is limited to the installation of the equipment, and 
this is done under the supervision of the authority's engineers. 
The company's role ends once the equipment is received here and 
before being put into service.

  [Text] Cairo, March 25 (AFP) -- An outlawed Islamic 
militant group warned Friday it would avenge the deaths of eight 
of its members who it said were "liquidated" by police. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) said in a 
statement sent to AFP that the eight were killed after five 
policemen were shot dead last Sunday by al-Jama'ah militants in 
Sedfa, in the troubled southern province of Asyut. 
  The group said two militants were killed by police in 
fields, 
three died in a shootout in Balayza village in Asyut province, 
and three others were arrested at home in the same region then 
shot by police, who dumped their bodies next to the Balayza 
victims, saying all six died in the same gunbattle. 
  The al-Jama'ah said police had adopted a new tactic of 
releasing detained militants and "liquidating" them allegedly 
for taking part in attacks. 
  It called on human rights organisations to put pressure on 
the authorities "to stop such practices." 
  Islamic militants have targeted the security forces, 
foreigners and Coptic Christians in their two-year campaign to 
destabilise the country and topple the secular government of 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  More than 300 people have died in the unrest.

to be Islamic militants shot dead a suspected police informer on 
Sunday at his shop in the troubled town of Asyut in southern 
Egypt, security officials said. 
  'Abd-al-Hafiz 'Abd-al-Na'im, 35, died on the way to 
hospital. 
  The officials said the outlawed Moslem fundamentalist 
organisation al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) suspected 
'Abd-al-Na'im of informing police about its operations. 
  'Abd-al-Na'im's death raised to 53 the number of civilians 
killed since Islamic militants launched their violent 
anti-government campaign two years ago. The campaign has 
claimed a total of more than 300 lives.

  [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--During the past few days the 
security forces have seized 60 automatic weapons, a large number 
of pistols, and many other firearms of primitive manufacture. 
They also arrested 250 political suspects, some with earlier 
political convictions. 
  This news came in an announcement today by Major General 
Mansur al-'Isawi, assistant foreign minister and Cairo security 
director. He said this latest campaign, carried out on the 
instructions of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, focused 
primarily on Cairo's al-Matariyah, al-Basatin, al-Sharabiyah, 
and Manshiyat Nasir districts. 
  Maj. Gen. al-'Isawi added that the security forces also 
rounded up 350 other people suspected or convicted criminals. 
  He added that counternarcotics agents who assisted in the 
security campaign uncovered 350 narcotics cases in which various 
types of illegal drugs were involved. Two days ago one kg of 
heroin with an estimated value of two million Egyptian pounds 
was seized. 
  Al-'Isawi reported that the security sweeps began several 
days ago and spread over the northern, southern, eastern, and 
western sectors of Cairo. The campaign, in which units from the 
Central Security Forces, Public Security, Police, State Security 
Detective Force, and the Traffic police participated, was 
designed to tighten the noose around fugitive criminals. 
  The Cairo security director said that the campaign was 
fruitful.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry yesterday started to reinforce 
the al-Qalyubiyah security agencies with "commandos" and threw 
tightened security cordons around the area of al-Khankah. 
  Strict security measures were taken around the homes of 
three 
extremists sentenced in connection with the attempt to kill 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi. The convicts are Salah Sulayman 
and Tariq Hasan al-Fahl, sentenced to death, and Muhammad 
Khalil, sentenced to life with hard labor. 
  The security agencies stepped up search campaigns in the 
underground terminals and on roads in the area of al-Marj to 
prevent weapons and explosives from reaching the families of the 
three convicts through extremist group members.

  [Text] Khartoum, 25 March (SUNA) -- Bishop Gabriel Rorech, 
minister of state at the Foreign Ministry, has said that the 
government is eager to continue negotiations with the rebel 
movement, because it thinks dialogue is the only means for 
reaching a comprehensive peace which will ensure the stability 
and development of Sudan. 
  His excellency stated in today's edition of AL-SUDAN 
AL-HADITH that he regretted interference from some foreign 
quarters, which are attempting to thwart the negotiations and 
are working to fragment the country's unity. He pointed out 
that the government clearly explained to the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development [IGADD] states that those 
foreign quarters did not want to see the establishment of peace, 
and were inciting the rebel movement in order that the 
negotiations fail. His excellency stated: We, as Sudanese, 
should advance the efforts of the IGADD in the negotiations, so 
that positive results are achieved. He confirmed that Sudan 
rejects foreign interference in the country's internal affairs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ineffectual Treatment of Chronic Condition"] </F>
  [Text] It was natural that the UN Security Council should 
restate the need to keep the sanctions in place, having reviewed 
the aberrant Baghdad regime's track record, which shows it to be 
persistent in its wrong-headedness, flouting all rules of 
international law. The Security Council has made Iraq's 
compliance with its resolutions a condition for lifting the 
sanctions. The nefarious calls that sought to crack the unity 
of the international position and thus unleash the Iraqi beast 
while it is still consumed with hatred and aggressiveness have 
collapsed. 
  With the extension of the sanctions, the international 
community must now be wondering about the point in seeking to 
remedy the pathological mindset and conduct that have typified 
Saddam Husayn's regime since his bloody coup in the early 
seventies. Can we realistically hope that the wolf will change 
its inherently treacherous ways? How much longer will it be 
before the Western powers satisfy themselves that the treatment 
is ineffectual and the cure impossible? 
  Our questions are prompted by a conviction supported by 
evidence that a disease persists and that amputation is the only 
cure to this corrupt regime. This is because the blockade and 
isolation have changed nothing in Saddam Husayn's behavior and 
mentality. He continues to issue threats. The dangers posed by 
the Baghdad regime will only go with its disappearance, since it 
has become a captive of positions based on treachery, 
aggression, and empty heroics, which it hopes will, one of these 
days, help him defeat the world! 
  The international community knew that the military 
confrontation that ended in the Iraqi occupation troops being 
driven from Kuwait was not enough to strike at the root of cause 
of aggression. Now, four years into the life of the sanctions 
and political isolation, this regime does not seem to have 
changed a bit. In its adamant refusal to recognize Kuwait's 
sovereignty over its territory, this regime is a peculiar mix of 
aggressiveness and arrogance. It continues to hold Kuwaiti 
prisoners as a bargaining chip, it flouts UN resolutions, and 
works to regain its offensive capabilities in order to resume 
the battle that has been weaved into its political fabric. 
  Trade sanctions and political isolation, as a form of 
treatment for this fatal disease, have ceased to have any 
healing effects. Every two months, the world will continue to 
review the Baghdad regime's compliance with the Security Council 
resolutions. However, the world will one day wake up to 
discover that this beast, which is swayed by an aggressive 
instinct, has unshackled itself to shed more blood; and herein 
lies the responsibility of the international community.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unremembered Facts"] </F>
  [Text] Three weeks after Hebron's Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
and the suspension of the Arab-Israeli talks on all tracks, the 
UN Security Council is still unable to reach agreement on a 
formula for a statement or a resolution putting the massacre in 
its true historical context as a consequence of the occupation 
and a logical result of Zionist settlement policies in Arab 
territories. Attempts to bypass the barrier of U.S. rejection 
of any UN resolution that goes beyond the superficial measures 
Israel has taken to absorb the world's anger have all failed. 
These measures sketch the state of the settlement activities 
and acknowledge their danger. But, they do not go beyond that 
to take a practical stand to end their tangible and potential 
effects, in the absence of any international deterrence of a 
repetition of the settlers' crime. 
  Today, when voting starts on the draft resolution, the 
United 
States will selectively choose the paragraphs that agree with 
its viewpoint. It will prove conclusively that the UN Security 
Council might be a forum for exchanging views on various 
international issues, but basically, and in the end, remains a 
mere reflection of the U.S. viewpoint, subject to predetermined 
strategic considerations. No one can influence this, regardless 
of how justified and logical his reasons may be, and regardless 
of how much they agree with the principles of justice and peace. 
  In all honesty, in its current position in the UN Security 
Council, the United States has shown a concern for its 
commitments. It has been faithful to the pledges it made to 
Israel in the form of assurances before the Madrid Conference 
and before the negotiations began. These assurances kept 
Jerusalem and the settlements outside any formula. The U.S. 
president recently reaffirmed this fact to freshen the memory of 
those who have forgotten the Madrid formula. This explains the 
U.S. objection to any paragraph that includes a reference to 
Jerusalem in the UN Security Council resolution that will 
establish a known reality, something the Arabs have already 
accepted implicitly. 
  What remains to be said is that the negotiations, suspended 
in protest against the shedding of Arab blood, will resume on 
the basis of generalities. This will save face, but will not 
change the reality that reaffirmed the facts, facts forgotten by 
the Arab mind and facts that taste of blood and suppression.

divert the Arabs and Muslims from the course of development. 
  In a statement published today in AL-MUSTAQBAL newspaper, 
the 
paper of the Yemeni Socialist Party, al-Bid disclosed that the 
signs of this serious scheme are represented by the acts of 
violence, terrorism, and crime from which many Arab and Muslim 
countries, including Yemen, are suffering. 
  Al-Bid noted that this scheme, which stands against every 
national and pan-Arab tendency toward unity, takes religion as a 
guise. He added that reason and religion reject such backward 
plans.

to defend national sovereignty, as well as another committee to 
prepare draft laws for security affairs.

Ministry to present a plan to evacuate the Armed Forces from the 
cities and to redeploy them in preparation for their merger and

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by political </F>
correspondent Gadi Sukenik "this evening"; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Sukenik] Mr. Peres, are you convinced that 
deliberations with the PLO will resume, and intensively so, on 
Tuesday [29 March], in preparation for the beginning of the 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Peres] Barring unexpected developments, the answer is yes. 
  [Sukenik] What will take place then? Roughly speaking, when 
can the withdrawal start and when can it end? 
  [Peres] If the negotiations start tomorrow [as heard] 
indeed, we may be very near the first objective, namely, the 
first half of April. Still, if there are further 
delays....[pauses] Look there is a certain paradox here: On 
the one hand, the PLO tells us to keep the timetable, but on the 
other hand, it does not begin on time. We cannot finish on time 
if we do not start on schedule. 
  [Sukenik] You know that the PLO points to security problems 
in Hebron and to the Jewish core in the heart of Hebron in 
explaining the various delays. You and Mr. Rabin repeatedly 
declare that a decision on their evacuation is ours only, 
regardless of the negotiations. Were you in a position to do 
so, would you now decide on the evacuation of some of these Jews 
at least? 
  [Peres] Look, I would take care of security in the largest 
sense of the word. This is not a personal matter. What 
happened in Hebron following the Cave of the Patriarchs incident 
is that the chance for peaceful coexistence between the settlers 
and the Arab residents was severely wounded if not killed 
completely. It will take a very long time for the wounds to 
heal. The settlers said they can have peaceful coexistence, but 
this is not the case today. We cannot reach unreasonable 
absurdities: place 120,000 Arab residents under curfew in order 
to defend 400 Jews who live there. 
  [Sukenik] What is the conclusion then? 
  [Peres] We need to reach appropriate conclusions about 
deployment in Hebron, from the civilian as well as the military 
viewpoint. 
  [Sukenik] Can we assume that Tall al-Rumaythah and Netzarim 
are the first settlements whose moment of truth is drawing 
nearer? 
  [Peres] I will not say a word on this. I would only say 
that there are large military shoulders carrying a very heavy 
burden. Still, civilian shoulders must share the burden. It is 
impossible to defend everything with pistols or guns or an army. 
We must radically change the situation and cannot avoid this. 
Today I heard of the slogan "All Israel Is Hebron." Let me 
react to this in simple terms: The fate of Israel will not be 
determined by the Hebron residents only. In contrast, the fate 
of Hebron will be decided by the majority in Israel. We may 
have different views among us, but the fashion in which a 
decision is made must be acceptable to all, without exception. 
In arguments there is no trigger, gun, or knife; there are only 
arguments in favor or against, and the majority can decide. We 
have reached a very sensitive situation on this matter. You saw 
a Jew getting up during the holiday and shooting an Arab driver 
in revenge. People use their arms as they please, and this is 
unacceptable to us. 
  [Sukenik] Coexistence in Hebron is impossible then, in your 
opinion? 
  [Peres] It is impossible at this stage. I believe the day 
may come when coexistence will be possible, but tension has 
reached its highest point today, and military measures are 
necessary. In general, we will not abandon anybody, neither a 
settler, nor any Arab resident of Hebron. Still, searching must 
be an overall thing, not just military. 
  [Sukenik] It is impossible not to ask a short question on 
the Syrian issue. In your opinion, does the nation support the 
Golan cause indeed? 
  [Peres] Many people who say we must not get off the Golan 
also say we must not give peace up, and everybody understands 
that the two are closely interrelated. The Syrians have now 
taken a step which the Americans greatly appreciate; it is quite 
a wise step on their part. It is they who accepted President 
Clinton's invitation to return to the negotiations in 
Washington. This move binds the PLO too, naturally; the PLO 
cannot stay out of the picture. I think that in contrast with a 
certain hesitancy in Jordan, in contrast with the difficulties 
we are facing with the Palestinians....[pauses] I believe, 
incidentally, that we are getting back on track, that within 
several weeks we will have a new situation in the Middle East: 
For the first time, there will be a piece of Palestinian 
reality which will be seen and felt, and, thank God, we will be 
able to say goodbye to Gaza. Goodbye to Gaza means peace for 
Israel without Gaza. I think it is possible to get on this 
track and that we should get on a track of very serious 
negotiations with the Syrians.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi </F>
Beilin by Karmit Gay and political correspondent Shlomo Raz; 
place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Gay] What will we be bringing to the talks 
due to be resumed tomorrow? 
  [Beilin] Are you referring to the Hebron deployment? 
  [Gay] No, I mean in general. 
  [Beilin] Look, I think we are very, very close to a solution 
to the issues of an international presence and of a token 
Palestinian police in Hebron, as well as the whole issue of the 
Gaza and Jericho agreement. I hope that tomorrow, or even by 
tomorrow, we will be able to resolve the insignificant 
differences on numbers between us and the Palestinians. We have 
agreed on who they will report to but not on the numbers. We 
will resume the talks on Gaza and Jericho with great intensity. 
I agree with your reporters' assessments that there is a very 
profound mutual interest in attending the talks and completing 
them as soon as possible, and with the sides sharing such an 
interest, I assume the talks can be completed and the 
implementation of the agreement can begin. 
  [Gay] Before we address the details of the remaining open 
issues, I would like to ask you about Yasir 'Arafat's distress. 
Will Israel meet him half way in order to help him out of his 
predicament, or at least to improve his position? 
  [Beilin] Helping 'Arafat or the PLO out of a predicament is 
not part of our goal. We are interested in achieving an 
agreement best suiting our national needs. In this sense, 
exiting from Gaza is most definitely a supreme national priority 
for us. By the way, I think the weakness of 'Arafat or the 
organization he heads will end as soon as the agreement is 
implemented, as soon as a serious Palestinian police is 
deployed, as soon as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] leaves Gaza 
and Jericho, when for the first time in Palestinian history, 
they are able to show a tangible change, rather than just 
slogans. When that happens, the domestic Palestinian condition 
will also change. [passage omitted] 
  [Gay] Let us now address the details. We have forgotten the 
two issues which preoccupied us before the Hebron massacre: the 
size of Gaza and Jericho; the status of settlements and settler 
security. Have we really forgotten these issues, or have they 
perhaps been solved? 
  [Beilin] They may have been forgotten by some, but that does 
not mean they no longer exist. The problems which preoccupied 
us are still there, but we have to remember that most of the 
main problems were resolved in the 'Arafat-Peres meeting in 
Cairo. What it means is that there are no more outstanding 
central, or rather substantive, problems, with the exception of 
one or two which will have to be discussed. There are many 
issues, particularly in the sphere of economics -- such as 
currency and the customs system -- which require detailed 
discussions, and that will definitely take time. There is a 
technical difficulty which must not be overlooked: The sides 
have yet to write the agreement they intend to sign, and it will 
be probably one of the most voluminous agreements we have ever 
seen, because while it does not deal with the permanent 
arrangement, it addresses so many details that it cannot be 
agreed on and written in a day. Its completion will require a 
very intensive effort for several weeks. 
  [Raz] But, Deputy Minister Beilin, political sources in 
Jerusalem have been saying with near-certainty that the 
agreement will be completed by 12 April. Is it possible that we 
are squeezing ourselves into such a tight timetable that we will 
be forced to make concessions merely because of our desire to 
wrap it up by then? 
  [Beilin] No, we will not make concessions on any substantive 
or even technical matter. We will simply have to work more 
intensely than we would have had there been no massacre, which 
put everything off by a month. This means that physically, we 
will have to work day and night in order to reach an agreement. 
We will have to negotiate without pause. These are extremely 
complex negotiations involving dozens of people. They will all 
take place in Cairo, and they will have to be pursued until 
everything is finalized. 
  [Raz] I have been told that the most complex part on the 
agenda is the so-called legal chapter. Where will it lead? Are 
we talking about legislative powers and the power to detain 
people -- namely, things beyond autonomy? 
  [Beilin] No, no. Everything is definitely within the 
parameters of autonomy. We have absolutely no intention to go 
anywhere beyond the Oslo agreement and the jurisdiction of 
autonomy. We must not forget, however, that in Oslo, we 
discussed principles, and not how things would look on the 
ground. 
  By the way, we are indeed close to an agreement; I do not 
think that is the main problem. I think there are unresolved 
economic issues -- mainly the problem of whether the territories 
and Israel will belong to the same customs system; that will 
have to be discussed at length. As I have said, there is still 
no written agreement, and that will have to be done. 
  [Gay] I think you are leaving for Oman this week. 
  [Beilin] No, I will travel to Oman on 17 April. It will be 
the first multilateral session in a Gulf state. This particular 
session will address the water issue, and I will head our 
delegation. [passage omitted] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1130 GMT on 28 March 
carries a report by Dick Winter on an interview he conducted 
with Beilin today. Winter points out that "Beilin, a member of 
the dovish wing of the Labor party, says he opposes uprooting 
the Jewish settlement in Hebron, adding that the status quo 
should be preserved in the city for the next five years."]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz in Tel Aviv] </F>
  [Text] This morning's cautious optimism about the Cairo 
talks has not changed even after the negotiating team reported 
to a meeting at the prime minister's bureau. The team reported 
on the progress made -- although no agreements were reached -- 
on what is called security in the territories, or more to the 
point, the observers and Palestinian police force in Hebron. 
The following agreements are being worked on: About 100 
Norwegians will be deployed as an observer force. They will be 
armed with revolvers. The Palestinian force will apparently be 
made up of several dozen policemen, which will belong to the 
Hebron Municipality and be linked to the Palestinian police 
force to be set up in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, while 
operationally it will be subordinate to the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces]. This is the deal being worked out. One of those who 
participated in this morning's meeting is Minister Yosi Sarid 
who is on the telephone with us. 
  [Raz] There is talk of restrained optimism. Can you tell us 
on what we should be optimistic and on what pessimistic? 
  [Sarid] Not only can I not expand, but I do not want to. In 
fact, I even wish to minimize. I think all the figures being 
mentioned are very imprecise, and I do not think it is proper to 
make a commitment about a figure. There are still differences 
between our position and that of the Palestinians. We will now 
try to bridge the gaps, but I would not like to mention a 
figure. I recommend treating any figure mentioned with 
circumspection. 
  [Raz] Minister Sarid, is the problem one of figures, since I 
believe that the understandings being worked out refer to about 
100 Norwegian observers and several dozen Palestinian policemen. 
  [Sarid] I do not want to go into that because I do not think 
we should go into numbers, since as I have already said that 
figure is so imprecise. 
  [Raz] Is the problem one of numbers while the principle of 
deploying observers and a Palestinian police in Hebron has been 
agreed on? 
  [Sarid] I think Israel has already agreed to a Palestinian 
urban police force. We still have many problems relating to its 
size, powers, and to whom it will report, that still have to be 
resolved. The same is true about the international presence. I 
think that in principle the matter is agreed on, but there are 
issues which still have to be resolved. 
  [Raz] What was the mood of the Palestinians you met? Are 
they still trying to dictate to us terms for the resumption of 
the autonomy talks? 
  [Sarid] First, I did not meet them, therefore I cannot say, 
but I think that based on the report we received from the 
Israeli delegation, we got the impression that there were deep 
deliberations. I do not think that any ultimatum was issued. 
What is perhaps important to note is that both sides appear 
committed to continuing the process and that they want to make 
progress since both understand it is vital in the present 
situation. 
  [Raz] Was it hinted to them in some, as reported by one of 
the newspapers, that the Jewish settlement in Tall al-Rumaythah 
will be uprooted immediately after Passover? 
  [Sarid] Nothing like that was hinted to them. I reiterate, 
if the Israeli Government one day makes a decision on the 
relocation of the Jewish settlement in Hebron it will do so 
totally unrelated to the negotiations with the PLO and to any 
PLO demands. It will be an independent decision by the Israeli 
Government based on clear-cut security reasons. 
  [Raz] Minister Sarid, this morning Foreign Minister Peres 
said that assuming the Gaza-Jericho talks open in Cairo, they 
can be completed within two to three weeks. Does that 
assumption remain intact following the consultations at the 
prime minister's bureau? 
  [Sarid] I usually support the foreign minister's evaluation. 
I believe that in addition to both sides being committed to the 
negotiations, there is also a desire by both to speed them up 
and complete them as soon as possible while remaining as loyal 
as possible to the original dates in the Declaration of 
Principles [DOP]. As is known, due to what happened in Hebron, 
time was lost, therefore it is difficult to assume we will 
totally meet the original dates, but they will hopefully be as 
close as possible to the date in the DOP. 
  [Raz] Does that means that the withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho will start in the first third of April? 
  [Sarid] I do not want to make a commitment about any 
specific date; I think that would be wrong. We always know 
there can be unanticipated events. I said, and I am prepared to 
say so again, that whoever views late May as the date when the 
implementation of the DOP can take place, will not be far off, 
but that is merely an assumption. 
  [Raz] One more question. Minister Sarid, after Sunday's 
cabinet meeting you said that the time is drawing near when a 
decision will have to be made about evacuating Hebron since 
otherwise the whole country will go up in flames. Are we 
drawing close to that date? 
  [Sarid] That is my personal view. I do not think we can put 
off for long decisions which have to be made, but they have to 
be made independently irrespective of the negotiations since the 
situation calls for them.

  [Text] The Israeli negotiating team returning from Cairo 
has reported to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on its tentative 
agreement with the PLO on security arrangements for Hebron. 
Also taking part in the meeting at the Prime Minister's Office 
were Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Environment Minister 
Yosi Sarid. Steve Linde has the details. 
  The Israeli delegation returned home this morning carrying a 
draft agreement on security arrangements in Hebron which they 
presented to the prime minister. Chief Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th said the proposal worked out in a 14-hour 
negotiating session in Cairo needed the approval of the PLO and 
Israeli leaderships. The details have not been disclosed but the 
security package apparently includes plans for lightly armed 
foreign observers, probably from Norway, and Palestinian police 
in Hebron. Both Israeli and Palestinian negotiators said 
significant progress was made in Cairo but several issues remain 
to be settled. The head of the Israeli team, Major General 
Amnon Shahaq, said the negotiations would resume in Cairo on 
Tuesday. Shahaq and Sha'th would not elaborate but reporters in 
Cairo said they were both upbeat, laughing and joking before the 
Israeli team headed home for the Passover holiday. 
  An Israeli source said the differences between the two sides 
were mainly on numbers, of both foreign observers and 
Palestinian police. The source said Israel would agree to 
several dozen Palestinian police employed by the Hebron 
municipality and connected to the police force in Gaza and 
Jericho; but, the Israeli Army would have ultimate 
responsibility for security. 
  Terry Larsen, the Norwegian envoy, confirmed that the 
stationing of observers from his country was being negotiated. 
When asked about early reports of a 1,000 observers, he said: 
take away one zero, presumably meaning 100. 
  Israeli sources say both the Norwegians and the Palestinian 
police would be armed with pistols for self-defense. Sources in 
Jerusalem say once the final details for security in Hebron are 
agreed, Israel and the PLO will announce the resumption of talks 
on the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.

  [Text] Several dozen Palestinian policemen will begin to 
deploy in Gaza and Jericho in 10 days. This comes about in the 
wake of the Cairo talks and the deliberations which took place 
at the prime minister's bureau today. Our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the first stage reference 
is to policemen who will have no enforcement powers, but will 
come to study the area. According to the agreement that is being 
consolidated, the Palestinian policemen in Hebron will supervise 
facilities, including the town hall and the university. Israeli 
forces and the Palestinian police will also conduct joint 
patrols, under Israeli command. 
  As for the Norwegian observers, it has been reported that 
Israel demands that they number between 50 and 60, while the 
Palestinians want to have about 150. Our correspondent adds 
that the negotiations which will resume in Cairo on Tuesday are 
slated to end by 12 April. 
  According to plans, the agreement will be signed by Prime 
Minister Rabin and PLO leader 'Arafat. Further meetings between 
'Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres may take place before the 
signing. 
  The prime minister will hold another discussion early next 
week, prior to the resumption of the Cairo talks on Tuesday.

  [Text] Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu says he has been 
informed that the government intends to exploit the massacre in 
Hebron to uproot the Hebron Jewish settlement. Speaking to our 
correspondent this morning, Netanyahu warned that such an act 
would cause a terrible rift. He reiterated his call on the 
prime minister to consult with leaders of the opposition and 
with the Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza settlement leaders on ways to 
safeguard the security of Hebron settlers. Uprooting is not the 
answer to the problem of their security, Netanyahu said. 
  He further stated that Hebron is the heart of Eretz 
Yisra'el, 
and that we have never acknowledged its being an occupied 
territory. He said he is against the uprooting of Jews from 
anywhere, including Hebron.

  [Text] The curfew on Hebron has been lifted. According to 
a decision by Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the 
Central Command, the curfew was lifted from the town early this 
evening, except for the area near Bet Hadassah and the Avraham 
Avinu courtyard. Only Arab residents who live in this area will 
be allowed to enter this area. The wholesale market near the 
Jewish settlement in Hebron will not reopen for the time being. 
Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] reinforced its units in Hebron in order to 
maintain order and to increase the sense of security for the 
town's residents.

  [Excerpts] In Hebron, the Army dispersed dozens of 
settlers who wanted to protest the detention of their friends 
yesterday. No force was used. Hundreds of Qiryat Arba' 
residents yesterday tried to reach the Cave of the Patriarchs to 
hold the Passover seder there. The Army prevented their exit 
from Qiryat Arba'. There were clashes between the soldiers and 
the settlers, and nine of them were transferred to the Hebron 
police. Later in the evening it was decided to detain five of 
them, and they were transferred to a Jerusalem detention center. 
They were dispossessed of their arms. 
  Moledet Knesset Member Ba-Gad told our correspondent that 
the 
number of detainees is 15. According to Ba-Gad, Rabbi Waldman 
held the seder on the road since he was not allowed access to 
the Cave of the Patriarchs. The residents of Bet Hadassah in 
Hebron told Rabbi Ba-Gad that they are not allowed to leave 
their place of residence. The settlers in Hebron are afraid to 
leave the town lest they will be forbidden to return and thus 
the number of settlers in Hebron will decline. Rabbi Hayim 
Druckman, one of the National Religious Party leaders, told our 
correspondent Mikha'el Tuchfeld that the security forces 
desecrated the holiday by erecting barbed-wire fences at the 
exit from Qiryat Arba', by bringing in hundreds of male and 
female soldiers by bus, and by carrying out other work in the 
area. [passage omitted] 
  Two border policemen and three Israeli civilians were 
slightly injured by stones during incidents in the territories 
today. They were treated and released to their homes. Twenty 
six Arab residents were wounded by soldiers' fire in Tulkarm, 
Ramallah, Hebron, and Gaza.

  [Text] Senior officers in the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
Northern Command have criticized the lack of professionalism 
shown by the SLA [South Lebanese Army] and the poor discipline 
in its ranks. The IDF officers said it was the irresponsibility 
and lack of discipline shown by the SLA officers who, on their 
own initiative, shelled al-Nabatiyah and the outskirts of Sidon, 
which led to the firing of Katyusha rockets at the Galilee this 
week. Four Lebanese citizens were killed and 30 were wounded in 
the shelling, most of them schoolchildren from al-Nabatiyah. 
  Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv reports that last 
night, the terrorists sneaked out of the SLA outpost they had 
seized in the Jazzin enclave. The body of a missing SLA soldier 
was later found at the scene. South Lebanon was quiet last 
night.

  [Excerpts] There were clashes between Arabs and IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] soldiers in the territories today. In 
Gaza, six residents were wounded by soldiers' fire, including an 
eight-year-old child who was wounded in the head and is being 
treated at al-Shifa' Hospital. [passage omitted] 
  Serious clashes took place in other parts of Hebron too. Ten 
residents were wounded by fire and blows during these clashes. 
Yoram Binur reports: 
  The incidents in Hebron today were particularly grave. 
Fatah's youths arrived at the central town square, erected 
roadblocks, and threw stones at the soldiers. Palestinian 
sources reported that 10 wounded people reached the town's 
hospitals. The debris of the Razzaq family's house in Hebron, 
where the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] wanted members 
were killed, became a site of pilgrimage today. The visitors 
were presented with the remnants of the missiles the Army fired 
at the building, as well as the live ammunition left there. In 
leaflets disseminated in Hebron today the Hamas takes pride in 
the fact that its members do not surrender. 
  In Nabulus, clashes between residents and the Army continued 
today too. Tension in the territories is mounting, and among 
other things, the IDF is again sealing off alleys and doorways 
which were opened as a goodwill gesture in the framework of the 
peace agreement.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. </F>
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, in Amman, by Ramadan Husayn, in Cairo, 
date not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Welcome in our program. 
  [Al-Majali] Thank you. 
  [Husayn] Prime Minister, His Majesty King Husayn has just 
ended a Gulf tour that took him to the Sultanate of Oman and 
Qatar. This tour coincided with important developments on the 
Arab scene. What was the outcome of that tour? 
  [Al-Majali] We are going through a delicate phase. His 
Majesty King Husayn always makes a point of exchanging views 
with his brothers the Arab leaders. His visits to Qatar and 
Oman were in this context. His Majesty is an advocate of Arab 
reconciliation and coordination. He does not want a new order 
to emerge in the region without all the Arab brothers being 
actively involved in shaping it. 
  [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, Jordan and Egypt held intensive 
consultations with the sides of the Yemeni crisis. The Yemenis 
then signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman. Soon 
afterward, disagreement surfaced again in Yemen. Is Jordan 
currently engaged in any mediation efforts to resolve the crisis 
in Yemen? 
  [Al-Majali] Since the onset of the Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni 
president and vice president have been in touch with His Majesty 
King Husayn, who they saw as able to settle the differences 
between them. With characteristic patriotism and pan-Arab 
enthusiasm, His Majesty worked closely with them until the 
pledge and accord document was signed in Amman. Differences 
then surfaced over the implementation of that document, but I 
think that consultations are continuing and we pray to God 
Almighty that the difficulties facing the implementation of that 
document will be surmounted. What matters is that they have 
succeeded in formulating a good document; and I think that 
everyone is committed to it. There are practical obstacles 
right now, but God willing, they will be overcome. 
  [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, the Arab League Council will 
hold its 101st session a few hours from now. Would you tell us 
about the Jordanian position on the issues on the agenda, 
particularly Arab national security matters and the amendment of 
the Arab League Charter? 
  [Al-Majali] Approximately half a century has passed since 
the 
Arab League Charter was written. The number of member states 
has increased and the international scene is no longer the same. 
Therefore, we believe that the charter should be revised. We 
also believe that there is a need to revise the UN Charter, not 
just the Arab League's. This charter [not further specified] 
should take into account the changed international scene, or 
risk being outdated. That is one thing. 
  Also, we believe that the Arab League should be a forum for 
discussing the new order in the Arab world. The Arab world 
should strive for more cohesion and solidarity so as to be able 
to avoid the type of disasters that have befallen it due to 
divisions in its ranks and a certain lack of communication. 
  [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, will Jordan press for a change in 
the 
original text of the charter or does it support the view that a 
new addendum would suffice? 
  [Al-Majali] Actually, I think that the charter's original 
text should be amended. But if the Arab brothers agree on an 
addendum and if that addendum is as binding as the original 
charter, this would be a mere technicality. What matters is the 
spirit in which the charter's amendment is made or the addendum 
formulated. 
  [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you see the situation 
now, following UN Security Council Resolution 904, which 
denounces the Hebron massacre, and in light of the current 
consultations concerning providing international protection to 
the Palestinians? 
  [Al-Majali] We hope that the spirit of this resolution will 
find practical expression. The Palestinians are in desperate 
need of protection, both during the negotiations and the 
transitional phase, the phase we hope will begin soon. We want 
this protection to be provided. Practical measures should be 
taken in this regard. 
  There must be a clear vision on the other [Israeli] side. 
The Israelis must abandon the fears they had in the past. The 
Hebron massacre proves the absurdity of talk about the 
settlements remaining where they are. These settlements are bad 
news for peace. The United States has expressed this view 
hundreds of times, as did the whole world. Therefore, there 
must be enough boldness to take the right step and remove these 
settlements, because they are quite a serious obstacle. I am 
aware that the two sides agreed that the settlements will be 
discussed in a later stage of the negotiations, but it is clear 
that the presence of settlements and the attacks by settlers are 
responsible for delaying the current negotiations. 
  [Husayn] That is right. What is happening on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks? 
  [Al-Majali] The situation is this: We believe in a just and 
comprehensive solution and want to see progress on all tracks. 
At the same time, we believe that every track has its 
particular nature and features. As we move along, we keep an 
eye on what is happening on the other tracks, because it is in 
the interest of all sides, including the Israelis, that a 
comprehensive solution emerge, rather than isolated agreements. 
Isolated agreements would only strengthen the hand of those who 
oppose peace and wish to wreck what we may achieve. 
  Therefore, I believe that we have to move forward. We hope 
that Israel is as serious as we are in this regard so that the 
peace process can advance on all tracks. 
  [Husayn] Thank you. 
  [Al-Majali] You are welcome.

  [Text] The cabinet held a meeting today chaired by Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. The prime minister reviewed 
the results of the recent visit to Jordan by Dennis Ross, the 
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator. 
  Following the meeting, Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state 
for 
cabinet affairs and minister of information, told the Jordanian 
News Agency that the prime minister explained the most important 
points raised during his meeting with Mr. Dennis Ross. Ross 
expressed his optimism about the possibility of reaching an 
agreement between the Palestinian and Israeli sides on the issue 
of security arrangements in Hebron, in addition to immediate 
steps to take measures ensuring the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. He pointed out that the Israeli 
side agreed to a Palestinian police force in Gaza, Jericho, and 
Hebron even before an agreement on the final arrangements has 
been reached. 
  The minister said the prime minister noted his meeting with 
Ross touched on the issue of the powers that will be transferred 
from the Israelis to the transitional Palestinian authority in 
various West Bank and Gaza Strip areas, with the exception of 
Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, and Israeli military bases, 
as well as matters pertaining to expanding the scale of these 
powers. 
  Al-'Anani said the cabinet reviewed discussions with the 
U.S. 
side on bilateral relations, with a clear emphasis on the 
methods used to inspect ships in the Red Sea by warships 
stationed there, most of which are American. During his meeting 
with Ross, al-Majali noted that recently a noticeable increase 
has occurred in the number of ships turned back for unacceptable 
excuses. Jordan strongly protested this in view of its immense 
negative effects on the Jordanian economy. The number of ships 
inspected since 1991 has reached 1,700. The international 
inspecting forces have not been able to find a single violation. 
Therefore, Jordan rejects the continuation of this method and 
thinks the inspection should be transferred from the Red Sea to 
the Port of al-'Aqabah and that inpsections should be done by a 
neutral, nonmilitary side. Jordan proposed this just before his 
majesty's recent visit to the United States. It was discussed 
during his majesty's visit. The American side promised to look 
into this matter seriously at the time. A breakthrough is 
expected in this issue within a short time. 
  Al-'Anani added that the third point al-Majali put to the 
cabinet, and which was discussed during Mr. Ross's visit, is 
Jordan's emphasis on the need for practical progress in the 
peace process. The Israeli side has been sticking to its 
position, refusing to broach substantive issues, and has even 
resisted the implementation of agreements already reached. 
Without substantive progress in the near future, the peace 
process will be subject to great doubts. 
  Dr. al-'Anani explained that the fourth point discussed was 
the return to the bilateral negotiation rounds in Washington in 
April. The Jordanian side had announced that the agreement to 
return to negotiations should be an Arab decision, particularly 
by the cordon states. This issue may be discussed as part of 
the Arab foreign ministers meetings that began today. 
  Al-'Anani pointed to the possibility that U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher may visit the region to discuss the 
return to the negotiation rounds in Washington and to agree on 
arrangements that would secure a positive development in the 
negotiations. 
  The information minister said Dr. al-Majali briefed the 
cabinet on the fact that Ross and his delegation said a tangible 
and clear breakthrough will be achieved on some negotiating 
tracks in 1994. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the cabinet session touched on the 
campaigns external parties have begun to launch against Jordan. 
The cabinet quickly reviewed an Amnesty International statement 
that included praise of Jordan's important political 
developments and democratic march. This statement, however, 
criticized some formal restrictions mentioned in the new press 
and publications law and the execution of some civil criminals 
tried by civil Jordanian courts. 
  The cabinet listened to an explanation of this issue, 
presented by the information and interior ministers. The 
cabinet noted that Israeli media are launching campaigns that 
cast doubt on the Jordanian democratic march. It is clear that 
this campaign has certain objectives and is in harmony with 
current pressures on Jordan, in order to affect Jordan's 
political and negotiating position. 
  The prime minister said the constants of the Jordanian 
position are clear, that Jordan seeks a comprehensive, just, and 
lasting peace on all fronts, and that Jordan adheres to the 
joint agenda calling for discussion of all issues on the agenda, 
particularly occupied Jordanian territory, Jordan's water 
rights, and the refugees and displaced persons issue. The prime 
minister said unless satisfactory solutions to these points are 
reached, Jordan will not sign any peace agreement with Israel. 
Jordan has shown a real desire for peace since the Madrid 
negotiations began. Jordan's position has always supported real 
peace and the negotiations process. Therefore, the government 
rejects tendentious campaigns that cast doubt on Jordan's 
democracy and democratic institutions.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has 
asserted that the Jordanian position on Jerusalem is clear, 
frank, and unequivocal. In a statement to Jordan Television, 
Dr. al-'Anani said he agrees with the PLO on the need for 
coordination before and after any event or political development. 
  Dr. al-'Anani was commenting on a statement by the PLO 
office 
at the United Nations. The statement expressed astonishment at 
Jordan's position on inserting the Jerusalem issue in Security 
Council Resolution 904. 
  The information minister asserted that the Jerusalem issue 
was only mentioned in the resolution's preamble and not in the 
operative articles, which much weakens it. He said inserting 
the Jerusalem issue in this way in the resolution made it 
difficult to omit the word Jerusalem, and led to the U.S. 
abstention. It gave the United States a future pretext to 
abstain or even veto any resolutions on the basis that it has 
demonstrated its position in Resolution 904. 
  The minister said inserting the Jerusalem issue raised the 
voices of Israelis and the leaders of U.S. Jews, who say 
Jerusalem is Israel's unified capital. He stressed Jordan's 
consistent position on Jerusalem, namely, Jerusalem is an 
indivisible part of the occupied Arab territories, as stipulated 
in Resolution 242, which provides for regaining all occupied 
Arab territories in return for peace.

<F P=106> [ By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter by P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--For the first time since the imposition of 
international sanctions against Iraq, a cargo ship carrying 
freight for Jordan coming through the Red Sea will be inspected 
on shore instead of high seas in what could turn out to be a 
precedent- setting event, informed sources said Saturday. 
  The sources said the Skyman, a 13,000-tonne German vessel 
carrying 3,000 tonnes of general cargo for Jordan, was expected 
to dock at al-'Aqabah on Monday and a "civilian officer" from 
the diplomatic mission of one of the members of the anti-Iraq 
coalition would inspect the cargo at the port. 
  The Skyman was prevented from proceeding towards al-'Aqabah 
on March 18 by the U.S.-led enforcers of the international 
sanctions against Iraq. After four inspections, the inspectors 
ruled on Wednesday that the ship could not be allowed to proceed 
to al-'Aqabah since they did not have "accessibility" to inspect 
some of the cargo. 
  The vessel proceeded to a Gulf port to unload cargo destined 
there before returning to the Red Sea for a new inspection with 
better cargo accessibility, the sources said. 
  "It was half way to a Gulf port from the Red Sea when an 
agreement was reached after Jordanian Government intervention 
that the vessel could be inspected at al-'Aqabah port rather 
than the Tiran Straits," where the inspections usually take 
place, said one source. "Subsequently, it was recalled to 
al-'Aqabah. The vessel is expected at al-'Aqabah on Monday." 
  The Skyman is carrying general cargo, including steel rods 
and animal feed, for the Jordanian market, according to the 
ship's agents. 
  The inspection of the Skyman will be the first on-land 
inspection of cargo coming through al-'Aqabah after the 
imposition of the sanctions against Iraq in August 1990. 
  It was not immediately clear whether the agreement for 
land-based inspection of the Skyman was a one-time procedure or 
the forerunner of a mechansim proposed by Jordan. 
  Jordan, whose maritime operations are severely hampered as a 
result of what many officials here describe as over-zealous 
enforcement of the sanctions, proposed early this year that the 
inspections be carried out at al-'Aqabah port by an 
international agency. The proposal was viewed positively by 
American administration officials, according to sources. 
  However, follow-up action on the proposal was at snail's 
pace, and Jordan was enraged by what appeared to be an 
escalation of the inspections and tightened guidelines imposed 
by the American-led warships patrolling the Red Sea. 
  At least seven al-'Aqabah-bound vessels, including the 
Skyman, were denied permission to enter the Gulf of Aqaba by the 
enforcers of the sanctions since January this year compared to 
20 during the whole 1993. 
  The Jordanian Government repeatedly protested to the U.S. as 
well as the U.N. sanctions Committee against the "siege of 
Aqaba." (see separate story) The Lower House of Parliament urged 
the government last week to refuse to return to the 
U.S.-sponsored peace talks with Israel before the blockade of 
Aqaba is lifted and the lifting is formally announced at the 
U.N. Security Council. 
  Diplomatic sources said the inspection of the Skyman could 
be 
a "dress rehearsal" for setting up a firm mechanism for 
land-based inspection at al-'Aqabah as proposed by Jordan. 
  Lloyds Register of London, an independent international 
agency which has extensive experience in cargo inspections all 
over the world, is tipped to be the body which would take over 
the inspection at al-'Aqabah as and when the mechanism is in 
place. 
  Lloyds officials have visited al-'Aqabah several times in 
the 
past three months to evaluate the facilities available for 
inspections and for talks with Jordanian shipping officials.

  [Text] Amman--A prominent Islamic Action Front (IAF) deputy 
has described democracy in Jordan as "superficial" and charged 
speaker of the Lower House of Parliament Tahir al-Masri with 
collaborating with the government in preventing deputies from 
raising issues that the government did not want addressed. 
  "Democracy is only applied when it is convenient to serving 
certain parties' interests, said Deputy 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabr 
(Amman First district), who charged that some of the issues 
raised by lawmakers in the form of questions to the government 
were disregarded during the House's first ordinary session which 
ended last week. 
  The IAF deputy told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the 
"sensitive issues" addressed by deputies were deliberately 
ignored by Mr. al-Masri who, he said, has failed to present them 
to the government. 
  Mr. Jabr said he had questioned the government on why it had 
allowed 30 Jews into Jordan, but denied entry to two prominent 
Egyptian Islamists. He said Mr. al-Masri did not pass his 
question on to the government. 
  The deputy also accused Mr. al-Masri of "overlooking" an IAF 
legislators' bid to introduce a law banning the consumption of 
alcohol in the country. A draft law on alcohol consumption has 
been presented by the government to the House, which referred it 
to its Parliamentary Committee. 
  Parliamentary sources told the JORDAN TIMES the House has 
decided to "sit on the legislation" to avoid the controversy the 
draft legislation is expected to raise. 
  The draft law puts some restrictions on the sale of alcohol, 
but does not ban its consumption in the Kingdom. 
  The IAF wants alcohol prohibited in accordance with Islamic 
Sharia and is expected to use religious clauses clearly 
forbidding the use of alcohol by Muslims to embarrass deputies 
who would not support its bid. 
  Other members of the House shared Mr. Jabr's discontent with 
Mr. al-Masri's "casual brushing" off of their questions and had 
demanded that all their queries be answered by the government in 
the House's last meeting on March 22. 
  But that could not be done and many questions went 
unanswered 
by the government, Mr. Jabr said. 
  During one of the last sessions of the House, several IAF 
deputies told Mr. al-Masri that he had nothing to "fear" in 
presenting deputies' inquiries to the government as it would be 
"pleased" to respond to all inquiries, some of which may be "too 
important" to leave unanswered. 
  Mr. al-Masri, however, dismissed the deputies' accusations, 
saying that these measures had to be taken because of the "lack 
of time," and that new arrangements would be made to accommodate 
deputies' requirements. 
  The disregard for democracy began long before this House 
convened in November last year, Mr. Jabr charged. He said it 
began when the government unilaterally introduced the one-person 
one-vote formula into the Election Law, which the Islamists and 
many other parties opposed. 
  Mr. Jabr added that deputies have demanded to be presented 
with a new draft election law of what he termed was of a more 
democratic nature, to be discussed in their extraordinary 
session which, parliamentary sources said, is expected to 
convene next month.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-THAWRAH writes about the vitality, importance, 
and positiveness of the Syrian stand vis-a-vis the peace 
process, about Israel's repressive practices, and about the need 
to deter Israel through firm international and American pressure 
to restore the credibility of international legitimacy. 
  Under the headline "The Vitality of the Syrian Stand," 
AL-THAWRAH notes that Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator for the 
peace process, has reiterated that the United States appreciates 
Syria's vital and important role in the peace process. The 
paper says: This new U.S. reiteration of the importance of the 
Syrian role confirms the fact that there will be no peace in the 
region without Syria and that Israel, through its intransigent 
policy, maneuvers, and aggressive course, constitutes the only 
obstacle to peace and the peace process. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that there will be no peace without Syria. 
The paper says: No further proof is necessary now that the 
world has felt the importance of the Syrian role in launching 
the peace process and rectifying its march and now that events 
have proven that it is impossible to bypass this role or ignore 
its importance with regard to continuing the peace process and 
achieving its objective; namely, a just and comprehensive peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH says that the peace process, which began 
approximately two and a half years ago in Madrid and which 
continued over this long period of time, would not have begun or 
continued had it not been for Syria's agreement on the U.S. 
initiative and had it not been for its positive stand on all 
efforts aimed at activating the peace process and providing 
opportunities to achieve the required progress. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: When the importance of the peace process 
and the kind of peace to be achieved through this process were 
addressed, Syria was the first to underscore this importance, to 
abide by the peace process, and to adhere to the principles and 
points of reference of this process. Syria's only condition for 
the peace process and its objective is to see this process forms 
an effective framework and an appropriate means to achieve a 
real, lasting, just, and comprehensive peace based on the 
principles of international legitimacy, as defined by President 
Hafiz al-Asad in the Geneva summit -- the peace of the brave 
that restores rights to their owners. 
  AL-THAWRAH also dwells on the policy and methods of 
deception 
and maneuvering that Israel has resorted to to prevent the peace 
process from achieving its objectives on the basis of the Madrid 
conference and the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Reactivating the peace process 
toward its objective requires, during the current stage, a clear 
international stand in which the U.S. Administration assumes a 
major role in exerting pressure on Israel to force it to abandon 
its policy of maneuvering, extortion, and aggression and to 
frankly accept the principles of the peace process, as defined 
by the Madrid formula, and to implement its basic principle, 
land for peace, without misinterpreting the content and the 
principle of this formula. 
  In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH writes about the Israeli 
massacre perpetrated against the Palestinian people inside the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque last month in which more than 400 were 
either martyred or wounded. The paper says that this massacre 
was only the beginning, and that it is another test balloon 
through which the Tel Aviv rulers aimed to measure the 
international community's reaction to and influence on the 
course of events. AL-THAWRAH also notes the new massacre in 
Hebron the day before yesterday, which coincided with the U.S. 
Administration's endeavor and the moves of U.S. coordinator 
Dennis Ross in the involved capitals to activate the peace 
process and to give momentum to its obstructed process. The new 
massacre also came in the wake of Security Council Resolution 
904. In addition, Israel escalated its military attacks against 
the cities and villages in southern Lebanon. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that this does not hold out any hope that 
Israel will succumb to the will of peace, that it will respect 
its points of reference, that it will respect the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and its charters, that it will abandon 
racist terrorism, or that it will restore the Arab's usurped 
lands and rights. 
  The paper emphasized the need to exert international 
pressure 
and to abandon quiet diplomacy in order to make the rulers of 
Israel follow the right path and accept the requirements of a 
just and comprehensive peace. The paper notes that Israel's 
terrorist practices constitute a serious threat that needs a 
firm and swift response from the international community and the 
U.S. sponsor -- whose role, initiative, and interests are being 
targeted -- to champion the international credibility and 
resolutions that are still being violated openly so that Israel 
will not remain above the laws of the international community 
and above questioning and punishment. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH calls for the resolutions of 
international legitimacy to be implemented, for protection for 
the citizens in the occupied territories to be secured, and for 
a firm stand to be taken to curb Israeli aggression to force it 
to withdraw from all occupied Arab territory.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Judiciary investigations in Lebanon have revealed 
the involvement of some Mosad-linked groups in the blowing up of 
the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, as well as their attempts to plant 
other explosives at schools and public places in order to create 
confusion, undermine national accord, and destroy understanding, 
stability, and salvation in Lebanon. Detained suspects have 
confessed that they were instructed by Israeli Mosad officers. 
The conspiracy is large and serious. It has claimed many 
lives, and might have claimed the lives of many schoolboys. It 
targets the Lebanese entity, the Lebanese accord, and Lebanese 
independence. The Government of Lebanon dissolved the Lebanese 
Forces Party after it convicted several of its prominent members 
of involvement in the Mosad's plan. 
  Blowing up the Sayyidat al-Najat Church, which brought death 
and injury to many people, followed the Israeli massacre at the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Israel believed it could hit two birds 
with one stone: Covering up the brutal Hebron massacre and 
destroying the large strides Lebanon has taken on the road to 
national accord. In the person of the Mosad, Israel planted 
several time bombs at schools and public places -- bombs that 
would have killed many people, if not for the efforts of the 
Lebanese forces that defused them. The Israelis planned for the 
bombing conspiracy to increase internal tension to an explosive 
point, allowing the Mosad to exploit the sectarian issue. 
  As a result, the Lebanese soon found themselves on the brink 
of a new civil war, the national accord was dissolving, and the 
sound of treacherous gunfire was again heard. Israel wants to 
avenge Lebanon and the Lebanese because they have stopped their 
infighting, restored the Lebanese motherland and its genuine 
traditions of love and coexistence, and got down to work to 
build their country and restore its vital role in the Arab and 
international communities, in full coordination with Syria. 
  In fact, Israel's daily brutal aggressions against southern 
Lebanese villages and cities cannot be isolated from the bombing 
plan. It is all the same conspiracy, designed to return Lebanon 
to the furnace of civil war, destruction, and agony by creating 
a situation in which brothers kill brothers, children die under 
the rubble of burning houses, women lose their sons, the 
homeland is wiped out, and sectarian sedition rises up amid the 
roar of guns. 
  All this raises a series of persisting questions about 
Israel's destructive role in Lebanon and the region. How can 
Israel's peace allegations correspond with blowing up the 
Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Juniyah, with planting bombs in 
Lebanon, and with raining shells on the southern Lebanese 
people? While the Israeli Government claims it had no 
information about plans to carry out the holy Ibrahimi Mosque 
massacre, it cannot disavow Mosad's plans to blow up churches 
and schools in Lebanon. The Israeli Army also committed a new 
massacre after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Yesterday, it 
used tank rockets to destroy homes in Hebron, causing scores of 
casualties among Palestinian civilians. 
  Israel's treacherous shells cause scores of casualties among 
the Palestinians and the Lebanese every day. Israel does not 
care if the victims are women or children. What is important is 
to ruin the Lebanese situation and destroy the Palestinian 
intifadah. The results, however, run counter to Israel's 
expectations. The Lebanese have enhanced their cohesion and 
exposed Israel's games. Lebanon's healthy situation and its 
accord will block every conspiracy. The Palestinians have also 
become more determined to continue their struggle and offer 
sacrifices. They are no longer frightened by Israel's tanks or 
guns. Israel's destructive role in the region and the peace 
process and its attempt to plunge the Middle East into the 
furnace of sectarian conflicts are also exposed to the world. 
Israel wants to expand and expand. There is no way for that to 
happen other than via a trouble-plagued Middle East. 
  The results of the judiciary investigations in Lebanon 
should 
open the eyes of many in the West, especially those who have 
sympathy for Zionism, to Israel's destructive role. This should 
prompt influential sides to curb its aggressive plans, which are 
aimed at returning to the law of the jungle and destroying peace 
prospects in the Middle East.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the efforts made 
by some international quarters and some Arabs to effect a 
revocation of the economic boycott of Israel, affirming that 
Israel has not taken a single step in the direction of peace, 
and that it has not made any worth-noting effort to render the 
peace process a success. On the contrary, the paper adds, 
Israel has done its best to demolish the peace process. 
Moreover, it has failed to express any willingness to withdraw 
its troops from the occupied Arab territories. Worse still, it 
has not changed, even by a hairbreadth, its hostile settlement 
course. It has not halted, even for a single moment, the policy 
of repression, terrorism, displacement, and killing. 
  Given all this, the paper wonders: What has changed to 
warrant an Arab revocation of the economic boycott of Israel, 
and the opening of Arab markets for Israeli products? Has 
Israel withdrawn from a single inch of occupied territory, or 
even pledged to do so? Has it halted its settlement policy? Has 
it revoked the policy of killing, displacement, and dislocation 
targeting Arabs? 
  TISHRIN states that the Arab boycott of Israel was a 
response 
to the hostile and criminal Israeli policies, which are in 
violation of the most basic rules of international law, the 
Geneva conventions, and the UN Charter. Israel has not made any 
change in its policies. Consequently, there is nothing to 
warrant an Arab revocation of the boycott. Worse still, the 
Israeli aggressiveness and anti-peace course has been nurtured. 
For, in spite of Arab efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Israel has committed 
massacres. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre is flagrant proof of 
Israel's aggressiveness. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN wonders: Would it be out 
of place if we ask those urging a revocation of the Arab boycott 
to put pressure on Israel to make it respect international law 
and human rights, and respond to the wishes for peace, 
particularly since the Washington talks have entered their third 
year, with nothing in the horizon indicating that the 
intransigent anti-peace Israeli position has changed? 
  Under the headline "Rabin's Threats Are Meant to Circumvent 
Peace," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The bilateral talks are 
expected to be resumed in Washington in April after Syria, 
through inter-Arab coordination, has given the peace process a 
new lease of life by bringing it back on track. 
  The paper adds: Although no date has thus far been set for 
the start of the next round of talks, the Rabin government has 
begun to step up its threats, and to couple these threats with 
aggressive acts against our kinfolk in occupied Palestine and 
southern Lebanon. 
  The paper goes on to say: Rabin attempts to shuffle cards 
whenever he finds himself cornered, and whenever international 
efforts to advance the peace process reach an advanced stage. 
The developments we have seen over the past few months, 
particularly in the aftermath of the Geneva summit, have shown 
that Rabin's efforts to circumvent the summit outcome culminated 
in the Hebron massacre, as well as a spate of attacks on 
southern Lebanon. These developments have also proved that 
Rabin has remained hostage to a maneuvering mind-set opposed to 
peace, and that he has continued to cling to a host of 
impossible conditions that cannot but obstruct the peace process 
and kill the new opportunities created for it. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH affirms the need to halt 
Israel's efforts to evade the requirements of peace, 
particularly since the attainment of just and comprehensive 
peace has become a regional and international demand that will 
reflect positively on the interests of the entire world 
community. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH comments on the 
tragic 
situation being experienced by the city of Hebron 29 days after 
the perpetration of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The paper says: What is currently taking place in Hebron and 
the remaining parts of the occupied Arab territories must open 
the eyes of the world community to Israeli practices. This must 
also draw attention to the tragic situation experienced by the 
Palestinians under the hateful occupation, which has turned the 
lives of hundreds of thousands of people into an intolerable 
inferno, and deprived them of the most basic requirements of a 
free and decent life. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: Israeli practices, which grow 
harsher and more ferocious day in and day out, and which have 
begun to take on an exceptionally bloody and heinous dimension, 
clearly show the Israeli rulers' determination to persist with 
their arrogance, stubbornness, and aggressive policy, which is 
diametrically opposed to the efforts to achieve just and 
comprehensive peace. 
  The paper notes that these practices underscore the urgent 
need for extensive and effective international moves to create 
the proper mechanism for the implementation of the recent UN 
Security Council Resolution Number 904 to ensure Israeli 
compliance with the relevant international resolutions, and 
provide the Palestinians with real protection from the 
repression of occupation troops. 
  The paper concludes by saying: Israel will be mistaken if it 
believes that it will manage to achieve its objectives through 
the pursuit of these policies. Israel must realize that the 
peace process will remain deadlocked unless it changes its 
conduct and concepts, particularly with regard to comprehensive 
solution and the recognition of the Palestinians' just and 
legitimate rights. No tangible accomplishment will be made 
unless Israel effects these changes. For, despite their strong 
eagerness to achieve peace, the Arabs will not bargain over 
their territories and rights. Nor will they accept anything 
short of complete withdrawal from all the occupied Arab 
territories. This is the only way to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
unidentified correspondent in special program on the Economic 
Cooperation Organization, date, place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The activities of the Economic 
Cooperation Organization [ECO] have been organized such that it 
seems the creation of a free trade zone -- where all the parties 
are to have an interest -- is the main objective of the ECO. To 
clarify that issue we asked [Foreign Minister] Dr. Velayati 
whether the ECO is aiming at a free trade zone or is pursuing 
other goals as well. 
  [Velayati] The ECO pursues numerous objectives, one of which 
is the establishment of free trade zones so that all member 
states have the possibility of participating in them. Two 
documents were confirmed by the leaders at the end of their 
meeting and were published. One of the documents concerns the 
ECO's long term perspective, based on the ECO's executive plan 
which was adopted during a session by the foreign ministers of 
ECO member states at Quetta in Pakistan. That became the basis 
for the ECO's long term plan. 
  What is intended in the ECO is mostly long term 
infrastructural cooperation; or infrastructural cooperation 
which can have most positive and constructive effects in the 
region for long-term ECO action.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gholamreza Aqazadeh, Petroleum minister of </F>
the Islamic Republic of Iran, by unidentified Voice of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran correspondent in Tehran, date not 
given; from the "Work, Life" feature--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, good morning and 
greetings for the new year. God willing, may it be a year full 
of success. Could you tell our listening friends what important 
projects were implemented by the Petroleum Ministry in 1372 
[year beginning 21 March 1993]? 
  [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. 
  I reciprocate new year's greetings to all our dear people 
and 
I hope that it will be a wonderful and constructive year for our 
country and people, God willing. Regarding the last (?two) 
years, we attained considerable success in 1372, which can be 
presented in the form of a list: 
  --The exploration of the Darkhovin reserves, which has 
approximately 9 billion barrels of very superior quality light 
oil. 
  --The discovery of a new gas reserve with 20 trillion cubic 
feet [as heard] of gas with very rich deposits. 
  --Regarding drilling, fortunately we have attained a 
wonderful drilling record since the Revolution: 300,000 meters 
on the nationally. 
  --In the field of crude oil production, we have raised 
Iran's 
production capacity to over 4 million barrels. The war caused 
extensive damage to the crude oil production industry. 
Fortunately, we were able to carry out repairs and 
reconstruction and raise our production from 2.5 million barrels 
at that time to 4 million. 
  --Regarding infrastructural projects, one of our most 
remarkable achievements was the inauguration -- in the presence 
of the esteemed president -- of the Arak Refinery with a 
capacity of 150,000 barrels and of one of the greatest 
petrochemical units of the country, namely the Arak 
petrochemical complex with a capacity of approximately 250,000 
petrochemicals, including light and heavy polyethylene, and 
propylene. 
  --In the field of gas piping, in 1372 we were able to 
install 
250,000 gauges in the houses of the people, and by activating a 
new phase of the Kangan Refinery we were able to raise its 
output to more than 55 million cubic meters. 
  --Fortunately, we were successful in expanding our gas 
piping 
activities in various cities, and in 1372 200 cities had been 
covered by piped gas or activities for expanding the gas piping 
network had been initiated, which was a massive and valuable 
project performed by the National Gas company. 
  --With all the deficiencies and shortcomings, it was an 
appropriate performance compared to other years for the National 
Distribution Company [NDC]. Fortunately, we did not experience 
any fuel shortages in the colder areas of the country, such as 
in East and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, and Kordestan 
Provinces. The situation was most satisfactory throughout the 
country, compared to all the years since the Revolution. This 
made it possible to have a very rare situation countrywide, and 
except for some temporary shortages in some cities, the 
situation was most satisfactory. 
  Fortunately, with the signatures of most of the deputies and 
their appreciation of its services, the NDC was able to plan its 
activities for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] in such a 
manner that we can resolve the problem of transporting fuel 
permanently, God willing. 
  These activities are a brief account of our projects in 
1372. 
Regarding the sale of crude oil and our presence in 
international markets, the situation in the first six months of 
this year regarding prices and sales were favorable and in 
accordance with what had been envisaged in the budget. However, 
in the second half of the year, with a slump in oil prices, our 
income decreased. In general, we had an oil income of $13.5 
billion, which was $3 billion less than the forecasts. In view 
of the situation in the international market, this level of 
income was quite appropriate and we were able to adhere to the 
production ceilings stipulated by OPEC, as well as to organize 
our exports within that framework in an excellent manner without 
any retail problems. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, could you tell us what 
programs you envision for 1373? If, God willing, you have any 
glad tidings for our compatriots, do let us know. 
  [Aqazadeh] I may state that since the development and 
distribution of oil and gas, the expansion of the petrochemical 
complexes is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We 
are optimistic that new oil derricks that have been set up for 
exploration in the Caspian Sea will become operational next 
year. In addition, we will begin drilling wells in the eastern 
Mazandaran Sea region, which is one of the most suitable sites 
in the country, even though it has not been explored in the past 
years. 
  Our prospecting activities will continue in the Persian Gulf 
and [words indistinct] fortunately, we have decided that the 
planning and construction of this refinery will be done 
completely by Iranians. This work will begin in 1373 and it is 
hoped it will be operational in 1375 [year beginning 21 March 
1996]. 
  A very important piece of news for our people is the 
value-added [arzesh-afzudeh] importance of this unit, as well as 
the magnitude of the production of the vast Bandar-e Imam 
complex. The glad tidings I have for the people are that this 
massive complex, which is the largest petrochemical production 
unit in our country and covers all branches, such as light and 
heavy polyethylene, propylene, EDC, PVC [preceding acronyms in 
English], as well as all other petrochemical products, is 
expected to begin full operation in Khordad [22 May-21 June] 
this year. 
  With these complexes going into operation, we will not only 
be able to attain self-sufficiency in most petrochemical 
departments but will also be able to export $300 million worth 
of these products this year. This is also good news for the 
factories that provide the raw materials for the petrochemical 
complexes, and they should not have any doubts regarding the 
sale of their products because we will ensure high-quality 
production at an international standard and will thus 
permanently eliminate the problems that they have experienced 
for so many years regarding petrochemical imports and 
fluctuations in foreign exchange income. 
  On the gas piping situation, as in the past years, we will 
expand these activities in various cities of the country, which 
is our priority. We hope that this year more cities in the 
colder areas of our country will join the gas piping network. 
  With the functioning of the Sarkhun Refinery in Bandar-e 
'Abbas, which has a capacity of approximately 15 million cubic 
meters of gas per day, we will be able to cater to the needs of 
the Hormozgan, especially of the Kerman Province, its power 
station, the peripheral copper industries, the Sarcheshmeh 
copper complex, and the cities on this route right up to Kerman. 
This will open a new chapter in the piping of gas. With the 
development of the refinery and its operation, especially of the 
(Karkehraker) unit in Abadan that distills furnace oil and its 
products such as gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene, we are 
extremely optimistic that 1373 will be a wonderful year for our 
people regarding the provision of their fuel product 
requirements. 
  I predict that in the oil industry 1373 will be a grand year 
for production, foreign exchange earnings, and the increase in 
the efficiency of this great industry of the country. Once 
again, I wish to convey my greetings for this new year to the 
people, especially to my colleagues in the petroleum industry 
who have behind them a successful year, and I hope that this 
year they will make the same sublime efforts so that the country 
is steered toward economic and political self-sufficiency. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, I am extremely grateful that 
you have given some of your time for us, despite your 
engagements. We hope you will be successful and that in the 
course of the year 1373 we will be able to be at your service 
again. 
  [Aqazadeh] Likewise, I am grateful for your efforts and 
those of your colleagues at the radio [station] for preparing 
and presenting such joyful, wonderful, and useful programs. 
  [Correspondent] May you be successful, God willing.

  [Text] After three days of talks, the OPEC petroleum 
ministers could not reach a consensus on the reduction of 
production ceilings for member countries and approved the 
current ceiling of 4.5 million barrels per day [as heard] to 
remain in effect till the end of the current year. 
  Aqazadeh, our petroleum minister, expressed his displeasure 
at the final outcome of the three-day OPEC ministers' session 
and said that the responsibility for this decision rests solely 
on those who are not supporters of OPEC and the oil-exporting 
countries. 
  The Saudi petroleum minister on the other hand, expressed 
his 
satisfaction at the OPEC decision to maintain the current 
production ceilings; however, he refrained from commenting on 
the effects of this decision and the possibility of a further 
slump in oil prices. 
  It was expected that in its latest session OPEC would reach 
a 
consensus. In the past few months, the GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] member countries had been in the forefront in proposing 
the reduction of oil production of OPEC and non-OPEC countries. 
These countries are also sustaining losses and had been 
adversely affected as a result of the oil prices on the 
international market. 
  The budgets for the current year of most of the GCC member 
countries have faced considerable deficits. The Omani oil 
minister had initiated extensive activity within the framework 
of the GCC recommendations for reducing production. He had 
contacted most of the non-OPEC oil-producing countries and had 
enlisted their concurrence for reduction of their oil levels. 
Therefore, it was anticipated that the pioneers of this 
proposal for reduced production would take the initiative in 
this regard. However, Saudi Arabia's opposition to reduction of 
its quota resulted in the failure of the session. 
  The Saudi petroleum minister expressed doubts on the 
effectiveness of reducing of OPEC production ceilings and the 
adherence of the non-OPEC countries to their commitments based 
on reducing their production and questioned the basic plan for 
reducing OPEC production. In general, Saudi Arabia's efforts 
were geared to retaining its quota of 8 million barrels. 
  The Saudi quota prior to the oil war was about 5 million 
barrels. The exclusion of the oil production of Iraq and Kuwait 
at that time paved the way for the increase in Saudi Arabia's 
production quota. However, after the return of Kuwait to the oil 
market and despite the possibility of the reentry of Iraq in the 
oil market, Saudi Arabia continues to insist on its quota and 
has now had it endorsed, in practice. 
  This tendency on the part of Saudi Arabia to preserve the 
high level of its production quota has prevented the OPEC 
ministerial session from reaching any consensus on production 
ceilings and it was forced to agree to maintaining the current 
production ceiling. Iran had proposed that with the advent of 
spring, which results in diminished demand, the ceiling should 
be reduced by 1.2 million barrels so that the price would be 
adjusted and strengthened accordingly.

  [Text] OPEC is to maintain its current production ceilings 
until the end of the year. The petroleum ministers of OPEC 
member countries were not able to reduce their production 
ceilings at the Geneva session due to opposition by Saudi Arabia. 
  Subroto, the OPEC secretary general, announced at the 
conclusion of the OPEC ministerial session that OPEC will retain 
the ceilings agreed upon for the first quarter of the current 
year until the year's end. 
  Most of the OPEC member countries and some non-OPEC 
oil-producing countries had expressed their willingness to 
reduce oil production in order to boost prices. 
  At the conclusion of the OPEC session, our Petroleum 
Minister 
Aqazadeh announced his displeasure at the latest OPEC decision 
and explained that the responsibility for the consequences of 
this decision will be solely on those who have prevented OPEC 
from reaching a consensus on reducing production and stabilizing 
the market.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The OPEC oil ministers' session last night, after 
two days of intense discussions, approved the organization's 
production ceiling for the next nine months. 
  According to this agreement the daily production level of 
the 
12 member countries is 24.52 million barrels, which is really 
the same as the present ceiling production level. 
  Thus oil experts believe the approved OPEC ceiling not only 
fails to support the present low oil prices, it will aggravate 
the process of their reduction. 
  It should be noted that the OPEC secretariat had earlier 
warned that the failure of the member countries to reduce daily 
oil production by about one million barrels would lead to 
further price cuts. 
  But despite the interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
the majority of the members, obstructionism by the largest OPEC 
producer forced the session to an unrealistic agreement which 
was in turn accompanied by greater dissatisfaction of the OPEC 
members. 
  Oil market fluctuation in the past six months -- which led 
to 
oil price reductions and a subsequent upset in the oil income of 
the oil exporting countries -- forced the OPEC members to seek a 
solution, through diplomacy and discussions with other non-OPEC 
producers, to control production and strengthen oil prices. 
  And eight non-OPEC oil exporting countries said they were 
prepared to reduce a maximum of 250,000 barrels from their daily 
production. 
  Considering the surplus oil supply and in particular with 
the 
coming of spring and summer when demand generally decreases due 
to warmer weather, the Islamic Republic of Iran proposed that 
the present production ceiling should be reduced by six percent. 
  This would have strengthened the oil market and experts 
believe oil prices would have increased by four dollars. 
  The OPEC general secretary and some other member countries 
also thought reduction of production ceiling was a necessary 
realistic measure and the only means of improving prices in the 
present conditions. 
  However due to the opposition of Saudi Arabia, the 
opportunity for success was lost and in the view of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and other OPEC members, the responsibility for 
the process of oil price reduction lies with those who did not 
wish for a reasonable OPEC understanding and agreement. 
  But our country, despite its dissatisfaction with the 
continuation of the previous production ceiling for the next 
nine months, will continue to respect OPEC regulations and will 
adhere to the new agreement and calls on all other member 
countries for commitment to the approved quotas and the need for 
strong political will towards the improvement of the oil market.

<F P=106> [Second Friday sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, </F>
spokesman of the Guardian Council, in Tehran on 25 March -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In this sermon, God willing, I 
will be discussing last year's events, as well as what we 
witnessed and observed across the globe, and finally what 
experiences were gained by the Islamic world during the course 
of the year 1372 [ending 20 March 1994]. I will also be 
discussing the policies and decisions that must be made in 
social and political realms in the current year, 1373. 
  Last year, we observed the architects of the new world 
order. 
We saw how they put forward a new order for the world. 
However, we also saw that the so-called new order was in fact a 
new tyranny. There are times that the tyrant indulges in 
injustice and oppression, but the victims do not realize what is 
being done to them. This is because the tyrants justify their 
oppression. This new order proved to be a new mode of tyranny, 
injustice, and crime. They imposed such tyranny, and committed 
crimes at will in different parts of the world. However, they 
invariably gave different names to their deeds. 
  We only need to look at a number of Muslim countries, such 
as, for instance, Bosnia-Herzegovina. We saw what 
justifications they constantly provided for merely observing the 
continued genocide of Muslims by the Serbs. The sad thing, 
however, is that nations are in a deep slumber. World radio and 
television stations control the ebb and flow of the public 
opinion. This is an ugly and very dangerous phenomena. For 
instance, when they chose to condemn someone, they do it in a 
way that people readily accept their words. [passage omitted] 
  When one looks at the situation in the world, and when one 
sees nations in their deep slumber, one realizes that these 
nations resemble children, trying to remain in their happy 
slumbers. [last phrase in Arabic from an Islamic tradition] Like 
children, until they reach their puberty, they can easily be 
fooled. They can be given a dummy or a bottle and yet believe 
that it is the mother's milk which they are being given. 
[passage omitted] 
  One only needs to look at Palestine. What can one understand 
from viewing as a whole the issue of Gaza and Jericho on the one 
hand, and all the crimes committed by the Zionists in an 
ever-increasing manner, on the other hand? What should the 
world understand from all this? The world is able to 
understand, but refuses to do so. This is because people listen 
only to a particular brand of propaganda. They fail to 
understand that Zionism is an entity which, as the revolutionary 
nation of Palestine have found out, can only be confronted by 
resorting to fire and bullet. The Palestinians have grasped 
this issue very correctly. [Crowd chants in support of the 
Islamic revolution and its leaders, and in condemnation of U.S., 
Israel and counterrevolutionary elements]. 
  Of course such is the nature of falsehood. But falsehood 
cannot always hide its nature. One day it will show its ugly 
nature and what it has done to people. They said: Come and sit 
at one table. They propagated this across the world. The 
Islamic Republic stood up and announced this as a trick. The 
revolutionary forces in Palestine too came together and said 
they would not accept this. At the time maybe many people and 
nations asked: Why don't you accept this and put an end to the 
conflicts? But now they look and see how vicious a wolf Zionism 
is. It is a vicious wolf. The crimes it has committed in the 
world. There is no time now. But I have read in books that 
even the distortions in the four Bibles, and I found the 
evidence, were made by Zionists. It was they who distorted the 
Bible. Whereever they penetrated and whatever political and 
economic affair they involved themselves, their criminal hands 
were greater than the rest. Such is the new world order and 
repression. 
  When some one attacked another, the latter would say: Oh, 
oppressor why are you attacking me? But now they attack and 
plunder the wealth of Muslim nations and exploit Muslim nations, 
but the latter do not say: Oh criminals why are you doing this 
to us? This is except for a group, a handful, including the 
Islamic Republic, and some others here and there. This is 
unfortunate and the only solution is the awakening of nations. 
And I have to tell the designer of such oppression led by 
American arrogance -- although you might bot believe it but we 
do -- that the Koran states that infidelity will be destroyed 
and oppression will be destroyed. 
  As the honorable prophet [Muhammad] graciously said: A 
government may survive if blasphemous, but not if tyrannical. 
[last sentence in Arabic] The tyranny of the West will collapse 
as did the tyranny of the East [the former Soviet Union]. We 
hope that [Western tyranny] is uprooted by the Lord of the Age 
[12th Shiite imam]. That does not mean that we should sit and 
wait for him to come. The wait means that we should also make a 
move. Exactly as we have, the way we have determined our path, 
guided by our eminent imam [Khomeyni]. The same path which is 
followed by the honorable leader of the revolution [Khamene'i], 
supported by our officials, the system, and the nation. That is 
the way it should be and that is the path. 
  Let not the unbelievers think that our respite to them is 
good for themselves. We grant them respite that they may grow 
in their iniquity. But they will have a shameful punishment. 
[Koranic verse, in Arabic]. 
  Masterminds of the new world order, we pray to the Lord of 
the Age that your establishment is turned upside down, God 
willing, God willing. We hope: Leave them alone, to enjoy the 
good things of life and to please themselves. Let false hope 
amuse them. Soon will knowledge undeceive them. [Koranic verse, 
in Arabic]. 
  Another issue I would like to talk about is this year's 
hajj. 
From this great base of Friday prayers I convey this wish of the 
Iranian nation to the Saudi Government. As the dear leader of 
the revolution said, the Saudi Government must not make trouble 
for the people's pilgrimage. Creating problems would be harmful 
to nations and beneficial to the enemies of Islam. You, 
yourselves, know that arrogance really wishes harm for Islam. 
But Islamic countries are all brothers and united. I hope 
that, God willing, the Saudi Government gives a positive 
response and, God willing, stops creating problems. 
  Another thing I would like to say is to pray for the souls 
of 
the passengers of the aircraft that crashed in Karabakh. We say 
to the Russian Government: You must correct this fault in your 
air traffic control system. That is a very regrettable 
situation. [passage omitted]
