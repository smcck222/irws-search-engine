  [Text] Paris March 21 TASS -- One of the important things 
that should be introduced in relations between CIS states is the 
conviction that all of them are genuinely independent countries, 
Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin said. 
  Speaking to journalists from the French-Russian press 
association in Paris on Monday, Adamishin said that Russia 
considers relations with CIS states as the most important aspect 
of its foreign policy. He called for closer economic integration 
of CIS countries on a volunteer basis and with the preservation 
of their political independence. 
  If Moscow wanted to retain them under its influence by 
force, 
this would be imperialism. But Russia has neither such 
intentions, nor force. Therefore it is tactless to accuse it of 
pursuing an imperialistic policy, the diplomat said. 
  On the contrary, it wants all CIS states to unite 
economically within the framework of economic integration, he 
added. 
  Speaking about Russian-Ukrainian relations, Adamishin 
pointed 
out that Russia is interested in an integral, economically 
strong and politically balanced Ukraine. There are perhaps some 
people who believe that the worse it is in Ukraine, the better 
for Russia. But this is a very short-sighted approach, he 
continued. If Ukraine slides into social upheavals, an economic 
crisis and disintegration, this will have extremely grave 
consequences for Russia too. "We will try to avoid this by all 
means," he said. 
  Russia is making no territorial claims on Ukraine. The 
Crimea should remain within Ukraine. They should settle their 
relations on the basis of bilateral agreements and the 
constitutions. But human rights should be respected in the 
Crimea as much as anywhere else, the diplomat said. 
  "We are for close economic ties between the Crimea and 
various Russian regions," Adamishin noted.

  [Text] Another report from our correspondent from Paris 
this time. Today the 91st conference of the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union has opened there at the UNESCO headquarters. Yevgeniy 
Lukyanov, our Paris correspondent, gives the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Lukyanov] The activities of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union are widespread. They are mainly 
directed towards developing cooperation between peoples for 
peace on the planet. They also help to establish contacts 
between parliaments and parliamentarians of various countries, 
exchange work experience, and defend human rights, the basic 
factor of parliamentary democracy. 
  The agenda of the present conference, which will work until 
6 
March, includes lots of questions. The two main issues that 
will be discussed concern problems connected with the prevention 
of conflicts, the maintenance of peace, as well as the problem 
of protecting the environment from various wastes of human 
activity, a problem that has now become a burning issue. 
  A delegation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
which 
includes the chairman of the Russian Federation council and the 
chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, has 
arrived in Paris to participate in the present conference of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union. 
  I asked Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the upper chamber of 
the Russian parliament and chairman of the inter-parliamentary 
assembly of the participating CIS states, to tell us about the 
aims of the CIS delegation, which has the status of observer at 
the conference. 
  [Shumeyko] [Words indistinct] about 120 representatives of 
parliaments of various states have got together. There is 
considerable interest in our inter-parliamentary assembly, 
because the CIS, about which we talked so much with you, has not 
been in existence for long. At the last plenary sitting we 
agreed to use abbreviations less and that it is better to use 
the word Commonwealth. Many parliaments express an interest now 
in what the inter-parliamentary assembly of the former Soviet 
Union, and today of free sovereign states, itself intends to do, 
what aims it has, what approaches. Is Russia turning once again 
to a totalitarian path, an imperial path, the unification of 
peoples? I think this will never happen, and we, with our 
assembly, will show this. I will evidently read a paper here, 
at least the French side [word indistinct] this. I will try to 
tell of our goals and tasks and explain to the world that we 
come with peace. [end recording]

  [Text] Two days of talks on Baykonur between Russian and 
Kazakh delegations in Moscow with Ukrainian experts taking part 
have been quite successful. 
  A senior Russian delegate told Interfax on Friday that the 
negotiators "agreed on a number of points in the inter-state 
accord, on which they earlier disagreed." 
  In his words, "Kazakh representatives responded with 
understanding to Russia's arguments that the launch site should 
be leased for no less than thirty years." He also said that a 
positive solution to the issue was taking shape among both the 
military and civilians at Baykonur. 
  He pointed out that there was the narrowing of positions on 
tripartite cooperation in the exploration of space between 
Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The sides are near an 
agreement on the joint use of the launch pad for a 
Russo-Ukrainian Zenith booster at Baykonur. 
  He confirmed that the problem of compensation to Kazakhstan 
for the use of Baykonur over the previous two years would be 
discussed by a special commission separately from the overall 
talks. 
  The Kazakh delegation is flying back to Almaty Friday night 
to finally coordinate its position in preparation for further 
negotiations in Moscow next week. 
  According to the Russian representative, it now remains for 
the sides to work out the wording of an agreement on terms for 
the launch site's lease, and complete their work by March 26 
when the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan are to sign the 
accord. 
  He said the negotiators stood a real chance of completing 
their job by that date. 
  As Interfax has learned from a well-placed source, President 
Nazarbayev is tentatively scheduled to visit Moscow on March 
28-29.

  [Text] Russia has once again threatened to completely stop 
supplying Ukraine with natural gas as of April 1 unless Kiev 
paid its arrears for earlier received gas by that date. 
  Informed sources in the Russian gas company Gazprom told 
Interfax its management had sent an official telegram to Ukraine 
demanding that the latter honor its commitments under a 
Russian-Ukrainian March 10 protocol and a contract between 
Gazprom and the Ukrainian gas enterprise Ukrgazprom. 
  In the protocol, Ukraine pledged to give Gazprom shares in 
its gas enterprises and pay by April 1 $100 Mn of the total debt 
of nearly $900 Mn. 
  The Gazprom sources said Ukraine had still not made a list 
of 
enterprises where Gazprom would have interest or determined the 
size of the Russian company's shares in them. 
  To date Ukraine has paid $59 Mn of the $100-Mn sum to be 
paid 
by the end of this month. According to some sources, Ukraine 
also continues siphoning off some of the Russian gas pipelined 
to Western Europe.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Spirin] </F>
  [Text] Beijing March 21 TASS -- Secretary-General of the 
Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) Dr. Subroto 
appealed to Russia to help OPEC stabilize prices on the world 
market. 
  "If we announce that we are going to cut our oil exports, 
and 
if Russia demonstrates her desire to participate in that action, 
then she should, of course, do the same", Subroto told ITAR-TASS 
in an interview. 
  "Or else there is no sense in cooperation, really, it would 
simply be harmful", Subroto continued, commenting on the 
information released by the Moscow-based World Energy Market 
Analytic and Forecasting Group (WEMAFG), headed by a famous 
Russian expert, Professor Yevgeniy Khartukov. 
  Despite the decline in oil production in Russia, she 
continues to annually increase the amount of "black gold" 
exported beyond the limits of the former socialist bloc, 
declared Khartukov, who also teaches in the Moscow State 
Institute of International Relations and holds a senior post in 
the American East-West Center (based in Honolulu). While the 
Russian Federation daily exported an average of 1.81 million 
barrels of oil beyond the Soviet Union in 1991, the 
corresponding figure for 1993 was 2.29 [as received] barrels. 
  The price of oil is hovering around an all-time low since 
OPEC was created, about 13 to 15 U.S. dollars per barrel, 
compared to 28 dollars a barrel just ten years ago. 
  According to Subroto, representatives of the OPEC member 
countries intend to meet in Geneva on March 25 to discuss a five 
per cent lowering of export quotas for their respective 
governments. If they agree to take this step, then the same 
suggestion will be made to Russia and other large oil producers. 
  "We alone cannot continually lower our exports" the 
secretary- general explained. "This 'cheating', by which some 
countries make profits off of OPEC policies but do not support 
the organisation on the world market, cannot continue forever", 
he declared. 
  Subroto, who was taking part in an international forum on 
attracting foreign investment into the development of China's 
oil resources, which was held in the Beijing hotel "China 
World", also reported that OPEC countries produce a combined 
24.52 million barrels of oil every day. Russia, whose 
representatives have repeatedly expressed their desire to 
cooperate with OPEC in coordinating their policies on the world 
market, produces about 3.5 times less than that. 
  "If we want to improve the price situation, let's work 
together, through the combined efforts of OPEC, Russia, and 
other major oil producers, including China", the OPEC 
secretary-general said.

  [Text] Beijing, March 21 (TASS) -- Taiwan, recognised by 
Russia only as a province of the Chinese People's Republic, is 
hosting Mikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the former 
Soviet Union. The perestroika man arrived in Taipei on Sunday 
evening at the invitation of the influential newspaper LIANHEBAO 
(UNITED DAILY NEWS). 
  The last Soviet leader and his wife are accompanied by an 
impressive eight-strong team of the Gorbachev Fund staffers, 
according to reports from Taipei. 
  The six-day tour is designed to give Gorbachev a regal 
treatment. He will be received by President Li Teng-hui, Prime 
Minister Lien Chan, Foreign Minister Frederick Chien-fu and 
other high officials. 
  Mikhail Gorbachev, called "a prominent political figure of 
the eighties" in Taiwan wants to address the legislature and 
hold a press conference on the last day of his visit. Before 
departure from Moscow, Gorbachev reportedly said, "I hope that 
my visit will help Russia understand Taiwan better," according 
to Taiwanese journalists.

<F P=106> [Elmar Guseynov report: "Russia Intends To Encourage Saddam </F>
Husayn"] 
  [Text] Russia is interested in the speediest lifting of 
the embargo imposed on Iraq by the United Nations. This is, 
inter alia, because it will thereby gain the possibility of 
recovering the sizable sums which Baghdad owes our country. 
This statement, disseminated by foreign news agencies, was made 
by a Russian diplomat who remained anonymous. 
  The statement seemed an absolute sensation because it marked 
a change in Russia's stand with regard to Iraq. On Friday the 
Security Council is to discuss the problem of sanctions in the 
presence of Iraq's representatives. 
  One of the leaders of the Near East and North Africa 
Department has told IZVESTIYA that Russia intends to insist that 
Iraq be given some reassuring signal so as to encourage Baghdad, 
which is being seen to make obvious progress in its position on 
arms control and the abandonment of programs for the creation of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
  This viewpoint of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
at variance with the present position of the Americans and the 
British. They see no signs that Iraq has merited any 
encouragement. At the same time a number of Security Council 
members, such as France, China, and Brazil, will obviously voice 
solidarity with Russia. 
  It is maintained on Smolenskaya Ploshchad that Russian 
diplomacy's present position does not signify a cardinal shift 
in its policy on Iraq. Russia has always held its own viewpoint 
on the events occurring in this region. In addition, 
recognition of the progress which Baghdad has made in the 
disarmament sphere does not signify the immediate lifting of 
sanctions. Russia will act in accordance with UN decisions. 
  At present 547 tonnes of crude uranium and 50 kg of enriched 
uranium, which that country possessed, have been removed from 
Iraq. But R. Ekeus, leader of the UN Commission for the 
Destruction of Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction, insists that 
it will be possible to speak of lifting sanctions only after six 
months of careful monitoring of Iraqi military installations. 
Meanwhile, the actual mechanism of such monitoring has not yet 
been worked out. Baghdad insistently demands the lifting of 
sanctions, citing the fact that keeping them threatens the lives 
of 400,000 people. Western countries, however, doubt the 
sincerity of Saddam Husayn's government. The Iraqi authorities 
are refusing to accept the Security Council's offer to sell oil 
under UN control, although we could be talking of a sum of $1.6 
billion which would be used for humanitarian purposes. Russia's 
new position could tie still more tightly this whole unusually 
tangled mass of problems started by the Iraqi troops' invasion 
of Kuwait in 1990.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksey Agureyev, </F>
UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Petrunya] 
  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Beginning May 30, 1994 Ukraine 
will no longer be a target for American strategic missiles, 
according to the agreements signed by the United States, Russia 
and Britain, ITAR-TASS and UKRINFORM learnt from well informed 
sources. 
  The sources said that this topic was discussed at the 
meeting 
between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and visiting U.S. 
Secretary of Defence William Perry which was held behind the 
closed doors. The major leitmotif of the talks was the 
implementation of the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement signed in 
Moscow in January 1994, as well as the agreements reached during 
the recent U.S.-Ukrainian summit meeting in Washington. They 
call for Ukraine's "denucliarisation" and providing it with 
compensations and security guarantees. 
  The second most important issue is cooperation between 
Ukraine and the United States within the programmes of economic 
cooperation and defence conversion. The U.S. will provide 
financial assistance to Ukraine to finance the conversion of its 
defence industry and build housing for the demobilised military. 
  Kravchuk stressed that Ukraine is unswervingly observing its 
obligations under the three-party agreement -- it has sent the 
second train full of nuclear warheads to Russia. 
  Perry stressed that relations between Ukraine and the United 
States are strategically important. He and Ukrainian Defence 
Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who also attended the talks signed an 
agreement under which Ukraine will be granted 50 million dollars 
in addition to 135 million it is to receive under the Strategic 
Arms Reduction Treaty. The means will be used to finance the 
dismantlement of SS-24 missiles. 
  Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement as a 
"historic move and a way-out of the nuclear deadlock." "This 
step and the ratification by Ukraine of the START-1 Treaty and 
the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free state virtually removes 
all juridical and other barriers for Ukraine's joining the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty," he said. 
  At the same time, Radetskyy said that "the fulfillment of 
obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process." 
He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out 
disarmament and solving social problems facing the military. 
  "We have also reached full understanding on issues 
concerning 
the Partnership for Peace Programme. We understand that 
Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures," 
Radetskyy said. 
  The sides also discussed cooperation in space exploration. 
The talks were attended by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William 
Miller.

  [Text] Moscow March 21 TASS -- There has been an 
increasingly growing number of attempts of disinformation about 
(President) Boris Yeltsin's health. Despite the press service 
explanations that the president's health does not cause concern, 
disinformation has been insistently repeated, a statement issued 
by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov on Monday said. 
  It becomes increasingly obvious that obtrusive attempts to 
impose a thought upon the population that Boris Yeltsin is ill, 
the desire to torpedo the president's attempts to strengthen 
civic peace and accord, attempts to press for the revision of 
the constitution in the part concerning the election of the 
president, the increased aggressiveness of the irreconcilable 
opposition and the amnesty itself -- these are the links of one 
campaign. Its aim is to destabilise the situation in the 
country and return to the tasks which the participants in the 
October revolt failed to solve at the first attempt. It seems 
like someone wants to make another one. The impression is that 
the lessons of the October 1993 did not last long. Abuses of 
the results of amnesty take place. 
  The president rejects the practice of psychological warfare 
in the Russian home. He states that together with the healthy 
forces of the Federation Council and the State Duma, supported 
by the democratic public and somber-thinking leaders, including 
leaders of the parliamentary opposition, he will continue 
efforts to expand the social basis of civil peace and strengthen 
Russian statehood, the statement said.

  [Text] St. Petersburg March 21 TASS -- Russian Navy 
designers have offered a new power technology converting nuclear 
submarine power plants for peaceful use. 
  The St. Petersburg-based design bureau "Malakhit" which 
previously designed power plants for nuclear submarines has 
developed a new underground nuclear power plant which can 
generate 220 megawatt of electricity and work for 50 years. The 
generator will be assembled in an underground tunnel dug in the 
rock at a depth of 100 meters. 
  The use of module-type generators and liquid-metal coolant 
make these power plants especially safe and convenient as they 
are secured against radioactive leaks and can produce as much 
electricity as needed.

  [Text] Arkhangelsk -- Elections to the Arkhangelsk city 
assembly held in eight constituencies failed, ITAR-TASS learned 
from the city electoral commission two hours before polling 
stations officially closed. By 18:00 only 12 per cent of 
registered electors had turned up at polling stations. 
  "The elections have been simply foiled and 200 million 
roubles thrown away," said Sergey Larionov, head of the managing 
department of the city mayor's office and member of the Regional 
Electoral Commission. He blamed poor results of elections not 
on a low turnout, but rather on those who scheduled the 
elections and who turned out to be totally devoid of an ability 
to forecast the situation. 
  St. Petersburg - A little over 20 per cent of registered 
electors had turned up at polling stations of the Leningrad 
region. However, some constituencies and rural regions in 
particular, reported a good turnout which in some regions 
reached 28-30 per cent. 
  The St. Petersburg mayor Anatoliy Sobchak has ordered 
elections to the St. Petersburg city assembly to be extended 
until 22:00 p.m. Monday. The mayor issued this instruction at 
the request of representatives of electoral commissions 
concerned about a poor turnout in the polls, which might render 
the results of elections in St. Petersburg null and void. 
  Orel - A turnout of 36.3 per cent had been reported by 17:30 
p.m. in the Orel region, exceeding the minimum 25 per level 
necessary to consider the polls to be valid. 
  Vologda - Chairman of the Regional Electoral Commission of 
the Vologda region, Sergey Pervushin, told ITAR-TASS that by 
18:00 p.m. Sunday the minimum 25 per cent barrier had been 
overcome in all rural districts and two constituencies of the 
regional centre. 
  In the city of Cherepovets, only 17 per cent of registered 
electors took part in the polls and it is unlikely that the 
necessary 25 per cent turnout will be reached by the end of the 
polls, Pervushin said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 20 March; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, while everybody 
in Ukraine is preparing for the early election of a new 
Ukrainian parliament on 27 March and making predictions as to 
what will happen on the 27 and who will be elected, there are 
people who have already voted at polling stations -- for 
example, at polling station No. 7 in Moskovskyy district, Kiev. 
Those are people who are unable to vote on 27 March and who 
can, according to the law, vote now. Thus, the election has 
begun. Tell us, please, can Ukraine survive such a multi-round 
election? The first round is unlikely to yield a full house; 
the second round has been mathematically predicted to result in 
[?one-third] of deputies elected. And then what, third, fourth, 
fifth? 
  [Kravchuk] First of all, no third round is foreseen by the 
law. Elections would then have to be postponed, extended, or 
deferred until next year. This problem is not a simple one. 
But still, I hope that people will vote for worthy candidates. 
Somehow I believe they will, because they should know that this 
is an important stage in the reform of the entire political 
system. If we get a new parliament, and if the new parliament 
at once passes a law on the local power structure, on the powers 
of local executives, their functions and their relations with 
the center, the Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet 
of Ministers, and finally passes a law on the president and what 
kind of president we are to elect, then the presidential 
election can take place in June. But if this election fails to 
take place, and these laws are not passed, we will wind up in a 
very tight corner, as I said before, a situation that is 
dangerous from the point of who is to govern the state and how 
it will be done. 
  Locally, we have authority: There are presidential 
representatives, administrations, councils, and executive 
structures [word indistinct]. They govern the processes 
locally. In the center, there is the Cabinet of Ministers, the 
president, and the Supreme Council, which is about to be 
elected. According to the Constitution, the council can extend 
its powers, but this article of the Constitution was passed 
dozens of years ago, when nobody had any idea that such a 
situation may occur during elections to the first and second 
Supreme Council. That is why it's just written there this way, 
but how do you implement it now, when a constituency can wind up 
with two deputies, one elected in 1990, and the other in 1994? 
  [Correspondent] And their relations are not stipulated in 
the 
law? 
  [Kravchuk] Not stipulated anywhere. So it's not a simple 
thing. Not a simple thing at all. We shall see another way out 
when the new Supreme Council is already elected. But what will 
happen is difficult to predict. 
  [Correspondent] But 27 March will be even a more difficult 
day for the residents of Crimea than for the rest of Ukraine, 
because Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy Meshkov, plans 
to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a lot of talk 
about this poll on the air. 
  [Kravchuk] I talked about it, too. 
  [Correspondent] And about your decree which abolished some 
of 
its premises. But a lot will depend on -- and I quote the U.S. 
Embassy press statement -- Kiev's considerable self-control. 
Does Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid 
Makarovych? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course it does. Because, first of all, this 
self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are 
acting in accordance with the constitution and the laws of 
Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea 
has exceeded his powers -- that is, has ignored the law, both 
the Ukrainian one and his own -- the Ukrainian president is 
acting clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you 
put both of these documents on the scales, then you will see 
that we are acting clearly in accordance with the law, while the 
president of Crimea has violated the norms of both Ukraine's and 
his own law. And that is dangerous. Our self-control shows in 
the fact that we are staying always within the law. The Crimean 
president's lack of self-control in this case shows in the fact 
that he wants to break the law and he is breaking it. I already 
said this, and I want to say once again that the main thing that 
needs to be done in Crimea today is to solve economic problems. 
  A group of Crimean [word indistinct] led by the vice premier 
worked here for a long time together with our law experts. We 
met them half-way with a new formula for the Crimean budget. 
Crimea needs to contribute 6,000 bn [billion] karbovantsi for 
general Ukrainian needs. But to give them an opportunity to 
balance out their income and expenditure, we allowed Crimea to 
contribute only 2,700 bn; that is less than half the amount. 
And the rest of the money will stay in Crimea, so there will be 
a balance between income and expenditure. Besides, Ukraine is 
contributing over 100 bn for the Crimean-Tatar problems, out of 
its own budget. I understand, and we said this at the meeting, 
that we should focus our attention on economic problems and 
start solving them. As for powers, or other things, they are 
being considered now as proposals and will be gradually solved, 
and even some borderline cases concerning the division of powers 
will be solved to some extent in favor of Crimea, not in favor 
of Ukraine. 
  But this poll, I think, is aimed at getting the Crimean 
population politically charged. So as not to merely talk, but 
to quote figures and facts, saying, this is what the public 
wants, and Ukraine is withholding that. I think if the 
president is a legitimate one, and this is being claimed today, 
that he is legitimate and must act within a legitimate 
framework. This is the main road. A legitimate president 
cannot break the law. 
  [Correspondent] There is a famous quote, which was also 
recalled by former U.S. President Richard Nixon after a meeting 
with you, which is your phrase: The president of Crimea may not 
obey the president of Ukraine but he must obey. 
  [Kravchuk] Please, don't. You know, I am very careful about 
subordination. I am very keen to see that people subordinate to 
me, whom I am responsible for, are people capable of meeting 
that responsibility. Then I am not worried. I am not keen to 
rule over people who can break the law any time or bring about 
unpredictable developments. Therefore, I don't even want to put 
it this way in this case. And there is no need for that. But 
the law, the Constitution, is beyond my will -- it is the will 
of the law. 
  [Correspondent] You know, Leonid Makarovych, this U.S. 
Embassy press statement also says that if one is to believe that 
the new political leadership of Crimea aims for Crimea's 
economic well-being, it would be better ensured by Crimea's 
active participation in the program of all-around economic 
cooperation the United States is starting together with Ukraine. 
This statement was made after your official visit to the United 
States. 
  [Kravchuk] By the way, there is one fine point here. We 
understand that Crimea has an [?informal] status of a resort, a 
recreation center, etc. It can become an attraction for ideas, 
capital, and so on, to turn it into a world-famous recreation 
base. It is possible. When Crimeans speak of a free economic 
zone, certain economic problems, of giving them more rights and 
opportunities for attracting capital, they have our support. 
But there is one point. And it must be understood in Crimea. 
Nobody will make a step without Ukraine's consent. If you talk 
about serious investment, the involvement of international 
financial structures, the European Bank, World Bank, the 
International Monetary Fund, and others, these organizations 
will not make a single step in relation to Crimea without 
Ukraine's consent. Thus, this can happen only within the 
framework of Ukraine. 
  We regard Ukraine as a system and Crimean problems within 
this system. If someone should think today that the government 
or the president of Crimea can directly approach international 
financial structures, international state structures, other 
states' governments, it is an illusion. Nobody will do anything 
in this respect without Ukraine. And everyone must understand 
and be aware of that. 
  [Correspondent] Ukraine, it is an obvious fact, adheres to 
the principles of the CSCE and other international legal norms 
in international relations. And if Meshkov is violating our 
constitution and our laws, he is violating the CSCE principles; 
therefore, this is extended to the extraterritorial level. 
  [Kravchuk] There was a program [words indistinct] saying 
there are problems of security in Europe, there are established 
international principles, there are norms. And the most painful 
problem of all is that of territorial integrity and sovereignty. 
This is the dividing line. This line determines whether there 
is to be peace or confrontation. 
  No one oversteps this dividing line. (?If you) [word 
indistinct] (?with) common sense and realistic policy, you do 
not overstep it. You know (?where this will lead to). 
  (?So) I would like to emphasize this so that everybody 
understands: Ukraine does not set itself the task of obtaining 
something from Crimea at all costs. We want (?both) Crimea and 
(?Ukraine) to tackle their problems. We shall help Crimea so it 
tackles them itself. That is what I would like most of all. It 
primarily applies to the economic issue. But whereas it was 
stated at the outset that it was the economic problems that were 
the basis...[pauses] (?They say) [word indistinct] political 
confrontation and the question of where to go and for Crimea who 
to be with and so on and so forth. First, this will not make it 
possible to settle economic issues and, second, this will not 
yield any results. Everybody [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, I thank you very much for 
taking part in our program. 
  [Kravchuk] Can I raise a question myself? 
  [Correspondent] Please. 
  [Kravchuk] I found this, by the way, when looking at the 
questions given to me today at Ostankino. One of them -- I 
forget the name of our citizen from Lugansk Oblast -- this is 
what this citizen -- or was it she? -- asks me: Leonid 
Makarovych, I voted for you, the citizen says. I voted for you. 
In our oblast now rumors are being spread around that you have 
built yourself a dacha in Switzerland. Tell us whether this is 
true. I was asked this question, incidentally, by a trade union 
leader from Zaporozhye last year. I officially answered that 
the president had no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building 
it and is not going to do this. I use all the conveniences of 
life that the Supreme Council provided me with. (?I would like 
to repeat that) there was an official resolution adopted by the 
Supreme Council, on (?27) minimum wages, a state dacha in 
Koncha-Zaspa, transport, medical treatment, and everything that 
is written there. There is nothing else. 
  I know, however, this: (?Under) the system of ideology that 
you and I studied, there even used to be groups which were 
called groups (?on the distribution of interdepartmental 
finances). It is known how painful this detail is as perceived 
by the people. You see, they say he came to power and at once 
builds a dacha in Switzerland. They even say I transferred it to 
my mother. She died thirteen years ago in 1981. There was such 
a question and this is my answer to it: The Ukrainian president 
has no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building it, was not 
building it and is not going to do this.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan </F>
President, by Ian Macwilliam in Alma-Ata; date not given] 
  [Text] For anyone who wants to know why British and 
European firms should be interested in his vast Central Asian 
republic, President Nursultan Nazarbayev has facts and 
statistics to hand. 
  He reels off the list of major oil and gas companies -- 
Chevron, Mobil, British Petroleum, British Gas, Shell, 
Elf-Aquitaine, Total, Agip -- that have made major investments 
in the Republic many are dubbing in hope "a new Kuwait." 
  The president says it produces 27 million tonnes of oil a 
year, targeted to increase to 70 million tonnes by 2010 and 22 
million tonnes of wheat. Sixty million tonnes of coal and 20 
million tonnes of iron ore are exported to Russia annually. 
  The figures continue with the minerals Kazakhstan has to 
offer -- 50 to 60 million tonnes of gold, 30 per cent of the 
former Soviet Union's copper output, 70 per cent of ts lead 
output, and so on. 
  Mr. Nazarbayev's official two-day visit to Britain begins 
today. He will do his best to sell Kazakhstan to British 
business. He is bullish about his country's prospects, and he 
fixes the listener with an unwavering eye as he elaborates. 
  He has been invited by the British Government for his first 
official visit since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. From 
the Kazakh -- as from the British -- point of view, the chief 
purpose of the visit is economic, furthering trade links between 
the two countries. 
  Mr. Nazarbayev will meet the Queen as well as John Major and 
and Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, and will 
address the CBI and Chatham House as well as having meetings 
with companies interested in Kazakhstan. 
  Agreements to be signed cover trade and economic 
cooperation, 
the attraction of investments, and foreign ministry 
consultations. An airline agreement and one on avoidance of 
double taxation will also be signed. 
  Mr. Nazarbayev, the former Communist leader of Kazakhstan, 
has emerged as the best-known leader of an ex-Soviet Republic 
outside Russia. 
  His policy of opening the way for foreign investment to push 
Kazakhstan into a market economy has earned considerable praise 
from investors, many of whom find the country an easier place 
than Russia in which to operate. 
  The Central Asian republic presents fewer political and 
bureaucratic hurdles than Russia. Mr Nazarbayev is undoubtedly 
the boss. His instructions are carried out without the 
bickering that Russia's unpredictable politics often entail. 
  The president outlines four priority areas in which he is 
seeking foreign investment . 
  Foremost is the energy sector, where oil and gas have 
already 
brought huge outside investments. "We are not seeking any 
charity here," he emphasises. "We want to invite foreign 
investors for mutually advantageous cooperation." 
  Second is processing in the agricultural sector. "We are a 
huge producer of wool and we want to start a wool processing 
industry also. We have cotton, but we do not have mills. We 
produce 1.5 million tonnes of meat, but we do not have a meat 
processing industry." 
  The third and fourth priority areas are in the extraction 
and 
refining of gold and other non-ferrous metals. 
  "You can't lose. Why don't English companies come and start 
working here?" Nazarbayev asks. "They are hesitant to come." 
  Fourteen British companies are now resident in Alma-Ata, in 
addition to 32 joint ventures. This compares with about 50 
American and 24 French companies registered in the Republic. 
  Kazakhstan is forging ahead with an ambitious privatisation 
programme which will transfer most of the economy into private 
hands within three years. Auctions are due to start next month 
to sell about 3,500 medium-sized enterprises to investment funds 
into which all citizens can buy with coupons that they get free. 
Foreigners are initially excluded, but will be able to buy 
shares and assets of privatised enterprises at a later stage. 
  Foreign companies will be allowed to participate in the 
privatisation of 37 large enterprises to be sold on a case by 
case basis, the president promises. 
  Ethnic relations are a possible future problem, since 
Kazakhs, a once-nomadic Turkic people, and ethnic Russians each 
make up about 40 per cent of the population of 17 million. 
Historically, relations between Kazakhs and Russians have been 
remarkably good. Economic difficulties have revealed some 
tensions in recent months however.

<F P=106> [Article by Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the </F>
Russian Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council: "Accord 
Has To Be the Expression of the Will of Specific Social Forces"] 
  [Text] The attempts to sign some kind of document on 
social accord here, in Moscow, will at best mean reconciliation 
among the branches of power. There have already been such 
attempts, and they came to nothing. As someone who has studied 
sociology, I consider that an accord, if it is possible, has to 
be the expression of the will of the specific social, political, 
and national forces which exist in society. Otherwise you can 
sign documents, you can even get on friendly terms with one 
another, but it won't bring accord because society itself will 
be endlessly upset by conflict. A mechanism therefore has to be 
found whereby this will may be expressed and formalized. I 
would think we need to three to five statewide priorities around 
which everyone could and must be united. Outside of those 
priorities, you may argue and counter each other all you like, 
but these three to five positions designed to preserve the 
state, implement reforms, and avoid local or large-scale civil 
clashes must be acknowledged by everyone. 
  Eveyone talks about accord today, but the word is given 
different meanings. And everyone wants his understanding of it 
to be adopted. Therefore what is actually often involved here 
is not the securing of accord but a struggle to secure one's own 
position. We need to stop fighting for our own position and try 
to find expression for the will of the people to that 
accord. I think that the president's Message, where there is an 
attempt to give priority to strengthening the Russian state 
system, could be a basis for this. The government program could 
be a basis. And the memorandum adopted by the State Duma and 
the Federation Council appeal likewise. 
  I have proposed before and do so now that there be convened 
an assembly of the peoples and citizens of Russia of which 
well-known figures from politics and culture, deputies, 
representatives of national movements, representatives of the 
regions, trade unions, and so forth will be members. And a 
memorandum, a charter of national accord, which will define 
priorities enabling civil peace to be maintained in the country 
could be adopted as the basis of all the documents I have cited.

<F P=106> [Yelena Tokareva report under the "At the Federation </F>
Council" rubric: "Prime Minister Suggests Patience and Hard 
Work"] 
  [Text] The head of the Russian Government demonstrated a 
serious approach to the most obvious problem in our general 
economic crisis -- the comprehensive nonpayment of bills. He 
specially delivered a cautious and well-considered report to 
Federation Council senators on the government's measures to 
combat this scourge. 
  But the government has no intention of reverting to the 
purely administrative measures that we all still remember in 
terms of mass monetary "amnesties." On the contrary, 
Chernomyrdin promised to begin the procedure of enterprise 
bankruptcies by introducing property liability for nonpayments. 
The means of formalizing nonpayments has finally been 
announced, namely the introduction of bills of exchange. The 
Tveruniversalbank has already advertised its system for the 
introduction of bills of exchange and won the premier's good 
opinion for its initiative. The Tveruniversalbank intends to 
solve the crisis of nonpayments by issuing its own bills of 
exchange. The stock market will then be filled with new 
securities -- "outstanding" bills of exchange issued by various 
banks. In that case, a process of secondary privatization will 
probably take place. In the summer privatization enters the 
stage of finding the "real owner." After buying up outstanding 
bills of exchange in the floated enterprises the new owners will 
seek out investors. 
  Provided that everything goes according to the premier's 
plan, we will enter a new stage of upheaval and discovery. 
Commercial banks are to play a major role here. 
  The premier said that he does not believe the state to be 
bankrupt and substantiated certain top-priority steps to 
strengthen the revenue side of the budget. First, the state 
monopoly on the production and sale of vodka will be revived in 
the near future. Apparently despite his commitment to market 
means of overcoming the crisis, the premier heeded the calls 
from the recent conference of vodka manufacturers. They were 
vociferous in their amazement that the state has opened the 
doors to illegal imports of narcotics and forgotten that vodka 
has always served true state values. 
  As for tough state measures, Chernomyrdin promised to 
investigate the practice whereby enterprises and organizations 
open about a dozen accounts and sit on budget money. One 
enterprise should have one account, the premier said menacingly. 
  The government will settle its debts, he said. By the end of 
March 4.6 trillion rubles [R] of the total arrears of R7.5 
trillion will have been paid. The state will pay some of its 
debts by exempting various enterprises and sectors from tax. 
  Interestingly, the premier's audience was not unanimous this 
time either. Senators with strong ties to manufacturers in 
their territories proposed alternative means of solving the 
crisis. Tsvetkov, leader of the Association of Manufacturers, 
criticized the premier's promise to tighten up tax policy. "You 
say that you are going to tighten it up, but whom are you going 
to tax when enterprises are standing idle?" Interdepartmental 
offsetting of state enterprise debts was then proposed. 
Incidentally, some economic experts think that is what will 
ultimately happen. 
  Nikolay Gonchar said that the country obviously does not 
have 
enough of a free money supply. Japan and the United States have 
far more money than Russia. He disagreed with the premier's 
idea that the state is not bankrupt, unlike enterprises whose 
output no one wants. "A state is not bankrupt when it can pay 
its debts. Money should not be spent on wages. But used to 
solve the crisis of nonpayment. What is needed is tight control 
over where the money is going. But first there must be money."

  [Text] The case of the murder of CIA staffer Fred Woodruff 
last year in Georgia will most likely be reopened. 
  Commenting on the wranglings in the world of international 
espionage, Tbilisi's newspaper REZONANS reported certain 
details. Attention was, for instance, focused on the fact that 
Aldrich Ames was in Georgia a week before Woodruff died. 
Attention was not paid to this fact at the time, but Ames's

<F P=106> [Feature on U.S. Defense Secretary W. Perry in Moscow, </F>
comprising report by Aleksandr Khokhlov and report by Leonid 
Krutakov and Dmitriy Kulik under the general heading: "The 
Russian Army Will be Getting Patrons From the United States"] 
  [Text] [Khokhlov report] After the talks in Moscow with 
U.S. Defense Secretary W. Perry, Pavel Grachev said that Russia 
could join the NATO "Partnership For Peace" program at the end 
of the month. But, as might have been expected, there are many 
difficulties and provisos. 
  Grachev was not very complimentary about the NATO 
"Partnership For Peace" program in his conversation with his 
U.S. colleague. 
  In the very near future, Pavel Grachev said, Russia will be 
presenting to NATO (and to the United States as well, of course) 
its "amendments" to the "Partnership," to the effect that it 
does not wish to and cannot sacrifice its geopolitical interests 
to the interests of other states. 
  When Russia will be submitting its proposals on 
implementation of the NATO program the Russian Federation 
defense minister did not specify. 
  After a reasonably brief conversation in the company of 
others, Grachev and Perry withdrew. The word is that the 
ministers went through the Ukrainian nuclear weapons situation 
and Russia's geopolitical problems in the Caucasus and Central 
Asia with a fine-tooth comb. 
  [Krutakov and Kulik report] According to senior Pentagon 
officials accompanying W. Perry, the "Partnership" program will 
develop in two basic areas: U.S. assistance in the conversion 
of the Russian defense industry and the creation of private 
Russian-American joint ventures based on Russian 
military-industrial complex enterprises. One promising area is 
the closure of research laboratories and curtailment of 
scientific studies in Russia as no longer needed, for example, 
in the nuclear weapons sphere. It was stressed that the United 
States will get access to the Russian market and Russia will get 
goods. 
  It is a tempting prospect, particularly as the Americans are 
promising assistance in the construction of housing for 
discharged Russian servicemen. But it looks very much like 
one-way traffic. For example, Pentagon representatives did not 
explain why the program does not provide for the establishment 
of joint enterprises based on U.S. military-industrial complex 
plants. And asked why the rate of conversion last year was 68 
percent in Russia compared with three percent in the United 
States, the answer was that in the United States conversion 
problems are linked to the problem of employment. In this 
context, it would be more logical to call the "partnership" 
"patronage." 
  We are not calling for a return to the days of the cold war. 
But, to use William Perry's expression, Russian and the United 
States are acting simultaneously as partners and rivals within 
the framework of the new program. 
  Until recently U.S. assistance to Russia took the form of a 
few inspection tours of Russian military-industrial complex 
enterprises and nuclear centers.

  [Text] Another battalion of Russian peacekeeping forces 
will be sent to Sarajevo at the end of March, Deputy Russian 
Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev told a news conference 
today. The servicemen are currently undergoing special 
training. The Ministry of Defense has drawn up a new training 
program for this. There are more than 1,200 Russian 
peacekeeping troops in the former Yugoslavia. 
  As for the tasks of the contingent for keeping the peace on 
the territory of the former Union, it was pointed out at the 
news conference that Russia is the sole power capable of 
separating warring sides. Russian servicemen are coping with 
this task successfully. For over a year there has been no 
bloodshed in the Dniester region and South Osetia. For the 
first time, representatives of the warring sides themselves are 
taking part in the work of the peacekeeping forces. That is, 
these are in part trilateral forces. 
  One of the main problems of life today has also affected the 
peacekeeping contingent; namely, the problem of money. During 
1993 over 26 billion rubles were spent from the Ministry of 
Defense's budget on financing operations to keep the peace on 
the territory of the former Union. It is hard to estimate what 
sum will be needed this year. The Defense Ministry hopes that 
this and other problems will be resolved by the law adopted by 
the State Duma on maintaining the Russian contingent to take 
part in operations designed to preserve or ensure international 
peace and security. [video shows news conference, UN troops,

  [Text] Colonel General Georgy Kondratyev, Russian Deputy 
Defense Minister, said at a news conference in Moscow Tuesday 
that 107 Russian servicemen had been killed and 193 wounded in 
peacekeeping missions since July 1992 when Russian troops were 
sent to South Ossetia to separate the warring parties. 
  Kondratyev said, the losses were 53 dead and 77 wounded in 
Tajikistan, 28 dead and 60 wounded in North Ossetia and 
Ingushetia. The corresponding figures are 16/25 in 
Transdniestria, 6/15 in Abkhazia, 2/1 in South Ossetia and 2/15 
in former Yugoslavia. 
  Kondratyev did not think that any group of countries or 
international organization would be able to perform peace 
missions as effectively as Russian troops in the former USSR. 
  Answering an Interfax question Kondratyev said that the 
country had spent 26 Bn [billion] rubles for peacekeeping 
activities in 1993. He thought that this amount would increase 
in 1994. He emphasized that the money had been made available 
by the Defense Ministry and that the Peacekeeping Activities 
Bill under consideration in the State Duma called for financing 
such operations from the state budget. 
  Kondratyev said that the Russian Defense Ministry would 
deploy its observers in the Karabakh war zone within two or 
three days, once the waring sides separated and a security zone 
set up.

  [Text] Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy and 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry signed the agreement in 
Kiev on Monday on additional aid to Ukraine for scrapping 
nuclear missiles. 
  Perry told reporters that the U.S. would give Ukraine an 
additional $50 Mn to dismantle nuclear missiles. Last December, 
the U.S. extended to Ukraine $135 Mn for this purpose. 
  Perry said that American-Ukrainian cooperation was of great 
strategic significance and that interaction between the two 
countries' military agencies was important too. He also 
announced that an agreement had been reached in Kiev on frequent 
and close contacts between the Ukrainian and American general 
staffs. 
  Radetskyy said that with U.S. assistance Ukraine had got out 
of the nuclear deadlock and signed the Moscow tripartite 
statement, which was an event of historic significance. He also 
pointed out that now nothing hampered Ukraine's joining the 
nonproliferation treaty. 
  According to Interfax-Ukraine, during Perry's visit to 
Ukraine a number of documents will be signed on the granting of 
about $100 Mn to Ukraine.

correspondent Sergey Balykov] 
  [Text] Kiev March 21 TASS -- Ukrainian Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov accused Russia on Monday of failing to 
follow trilateral accords reached at a Moscow summit, and 
threatened his country might suspend fulfilling obligations 
under the agreement signed by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine 
and the USA. 
  Under the agreement Ukraine was to receive nuclear fuel in 
exchange for giving up its nuclear warheads. 
  Whereas Ukraine is abiding by the accord "it cannot be said 
the same about Russia", Shmarov told a news conference after a 
meeting with U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry. 
  Ukraine has already dispatched two trainloads of warheads 
but 
"there is no adequate steps from Russia". Ukraine has got 
nothing in response so far, Shmarov stressed. 
  According to him, Russia has not supplied a single lot of 
nuclear fuel, complaining in turn that the USA was failing to 
abide by the accord under which it was to pay Russia 60 million 
dollars. 
  Shmarov said Russian leadership had promised to "straighten 
things out". But the political tension in Ukraine grows and it 
might, as a result, suspend fulfilling its obligations under the 
trilateral agreement, he said.

  [Text] Before the forthcoming parliamentary elections in 
Ukraine, several important parties there are demanding that, 
despite previous agreements, the country should retain some of 
its nuclear weapons. "The Echo" program correspondent Kjell 
Albin Abrahamson reports from Ukraine. 
  [Abrahamson] Today Yeltsin is governing Russia, but tomorrow 
Zhirinovskiy may come to power. Today President Clinton is 
supporting Ukraine, but we know nothing about the next U.S. 
president. This was said by Ukrainian General (Oleksandr Rul), 
who will stand as a candidate of the super-nationalist Congress 
of Ukrainian Nationalists in the parliamentary elections. He 
now sees nationalism and nuclear weapons as the best guarantee 
for an independent and sovereign Ukraine. 
  Most political parties here share that view, including the 
Republican Party -- an offshoot of the dissident movement -- and 
the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, which want Ukraine to 
retain some of its nearly 1,800 nuclear warheads. General (Rul) 
points out: It is us, not you who are in the immediate 
frontline in the event of a Russian attack.

  [Text] Yesterday [16 March], the Estonian Republic's 
President L. Meri arrived in our country on an official visit. 
A ceremony was held on the occasion. The presidents of Ukraine 
and Estonia inspected the guard of honor. Following that, L. 
Kravchuk and L. Meri held negotiations tete-a-tete. As has 
become known from well-informed sources, the sides discussed a 
series of questions that dealt with an intensification of 
bilateral cooperation and with some international problems. 
During the first half of the day, joint Ukrainian-Estonian 
documents were also signed; in particular, agreements on 
cooperation in the spheres of education, science, and culture, 
as well as on procedures for travel by citizens holding 
diplomatic passports. The sides signed a protocol on 
consultations between external political departments of both 
countries. 
  President of the Estonian Republic L. Meri was received by 
chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I. Plyushch, who briefed 
the high guest on the present political and economic situation 
in our state and spoke in favor of expanding bilateral 
parliamentary ties. 
  On the same day, L. Meri met with our state's acting prime 
minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy. The sides discussed problems in the 
development of Ukrainian-Estonian economic cooperation and 
possibilities of removing obstacles on the road toward 
intensifying contacts between entrepreneurs of both countries. 
  In the second half of the day, the Estonian president laid a 
wreath at the Grave of the Unknown Soldier and visited the Kiev 
Cave Monastery. In the evening, the Ukrainian president gave a 
dinner in honor of the president of the Estonian Republic.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on a 
meeting between Sergey Filatov, Russian president's chief of 
staff, and Aslambek Akbulatov, Chechen secretary of state. 
  Filatov and Akbulatov met in Moscow on Monday. According to 
sources from Groznyy, arrangemenrs for a meeting between 
presidents Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev were discussed. 
The two presidents' meeting has been so far postponed for an 
indefinite time, the sources said. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on mounting interest in Yuriy Skokov: 
"Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the Federation of Commodity Producers 
(FCP), has makrkedly increased his activity of late. His 
activity and particularly the FCP efforts aimed at softening a 
sweeping production downturn, it seems, wins support not only 
among industrialists and trade unions but also among 
entrepreneurs, who until recently viewed him rather sceptically. 
Interest in Skokov is also mounting in view of his intention to 
run for the presidency in 1996". 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the unlikelihood of a 
Crimean-Ukrainian war. 
  "It is unlikely that there will be a war between the Crimea 
and Ukraine in the coming days. At any rate, this is how it 
looks like on the 45th day of Yuriy Meshkov's presidency in the 
Crimea, although Defence Ministry officials in Kiev, in their 
interviews with Ukrainian news media, increasingly often speak 
about the need to stabilise the situation in the Crimea and 
their readiness to restore order there by force. 
  "At a time when people are concerned about their future and 
living standards disastrously decline, politicians often dream 
about a war." 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the spectre of civil war in Russia: 
"The spectre of civil war has been roaming Russia for several 
years now. Presistence with which it is evoked is little 
connected with the real living conditions but is closely linked 
with the actions of some or other power and social structures. 
  "This time the phantom of civil war has arisen from the 
State 
Duma's political amnesty decision. The Duma was also the first 
to try to neutralise the consequences of its own decision with a 
memorandum of accord -- well aware, most likely, that peaceable 
rhetoric will be just rhetoric but that political struggle will 
gain in keenness, which would be dangerous to the country's 
tranquility but beneficial to certain social forces. 
  "This is traditional for Russian life: a problem is brought 
about and then everyone rushes to find a solution". 
  TRUD on businesses' disagreement with Russian state customs 
committee decision to raise import duties. 
  Directors of 12 major commercial organisations engaging in 
the import and marketing of food from abroad, have expressed 
their disagreement with the state customs committee decision to 
raise import duties. 
  "The reasons for such rejection are understandable: the 
import of food has long become an indispensable condition for 
the functioning of the consumer market in large cities". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an exclusive interview with U.S. 
Secretary of Defence William Perry in Moscow. 
  The newspaper quotes Mr Perry as saying that he encountered 
scepticism among some members of the State Duma about the 
sincerity of the U.S. desire to maintain equitable cooperation 
with Russia. In view of that, Mr Perry told Duma members that a 
businesslike pragmatic partnership must be the two countries' 
common objective. 
  PRAVDA runs an interview with prominent publicist Boris 
Oleynik. 
  "Any provocateurs, hired under any contract, can march under 
various banners -- red, golden-blue or other ones. The banners 
are not to blame, but those who brandish them bear special 
responsibility," Oleynik pointed out.

  [Text] Early this morning, Russia's Defense Minister Army 
General Pavel Grachev, left for Tajikistan. 
  [Begin Grachev recording] First, these are planned exercises 
involving units from the 201st [motorized rifle] Division. 
Second, they are coalition exercises, since subunits from the 
Armed Forces of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will participate in 
the exercises. The whole essence of these exercises is that for 
the first time, the exercises are taking place with the subunits 
of various states, that is, CIS states. 
  I have set myself the main task of checking the combat 
readiness of the units in the 201st Division, their military 
training, the coordination of the subunits, and also the 
individual training of NCOs, privates, and officers. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] But it is not just the joint exercises that 
interest the minister; Grachev is taking a collection of musical 
instruments on behalf of the Russian Children's Foundation. 
Humanitarian aid is also going with him, sent by General 
Burlakov, the commander of the Western Group of Forces. All 
this is for the children of the 201st Division of Russian troops 
in Tajikistan.

<F P=106> [Article by T. Smirnova: "The Law in Camouflage Fatigues"] </F>
  [Text] A naive people, until recently we consoled 
ourselves: This is it; we have exhausted, through our 
grandmothers and grandfathers, mothers and fathers, a full 
measure of wars and revolutions, night searches and cattle 
boxcars. We played hide-and-seek with ourselves: A generation 
without wars, we will certainly sail into a quiet old age, will 
tend to our grandchildren and contemplate eternity. Alas, one 
cannot sidle into history! 
  The mayoralty was seized the second time. After correcting 
the minor flaps that had occurred during the first try. So you 
did not like the timing? You say: Why was the raid organized on 
a weekend; the people were not warned; and why did you stomp the 
floor, brandishing submachine guns? Our apologies--we all learn 
from our mistakes. Would Wednesday, in the middle of the week, 
be better for you? At 1800, after work? We can dispense with the 
submachine guns, too--are there any volunteers to go against the 
trained OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments] guys and 
their truncheons? Regarding the warning--that you also had! As 
early as on Monday, authorized comrades had been trying to break 
through into the mayoralty with the order to replace the 
authorities. And by Wednesday the kray leadership paid a visit 
to the "Gray House," with the mission of dethroning Mayor V.I. 
Cherepkov and his first deputy, the city administrator V.A. 
Gilgenberg. The action was carried out by kray governor's 
deputies I.P. Lebedinets and A.V. Gartman, as well as kray 
administration department chiefs A.I. Yegorov, V.F. Terekhov, 
and K.B. Tolstoshein. A decree by acting head of kray 
administration I.P. Lebedinets was read out, relieving from his 
duties V.I. Cherepkov and appointing K.B. Tolstoshein as acting 
head of the city administration. In short, the protocol was 
observed-- according to eyewitnesses inside the building. 
  As to eyewitnesses outside of it, they did not get to see 
much. OMON soldiers were behind the glass door, blocking it. The 
clank of that same door, letting out--in batches--mayoralty 
personnel. There were smiles on the faces of some ladies: 
Finally, real masters have arrived! Reinforcements arrived--an 
additional OMON group in camouflage fatigues. 
  "I managed to slip into the building several minutes before 
the raid: I had been warned on the impending action," says P.M. 
Dovganyuk, a former kray soviet deputy, and a candidate for the 
kray duma deputy. I was in V.I. Cherepkov's waiting room. Heard 
stomping feet and noise downstairs. Someone in the waiting room 
ran to close the door. I interfered--it did not make sense to 
close the door, it would be smashed into pieces anyway. They 
agreed with me. At that very moment OMON charged in. The storm 
troopers were being directed by a man in civilian clothes. He 
introduced himself as Ivanov.... City administrator Vladimir 
Gilgenberg behaved with great dignity...." 
  The closing scene of the city administrator's "dignified" 
appearance before the crowd milling in front of the building 
soon materialized. The door opened with a clank and Gilgenberg 
was thrown out, landing at the crowd's feet. 
  "As of today, in keeping with the directive, I was the 
acting 
mayor, because Viktor Ivanovich is sick," Vladimir Gilgenberg 
began his street interview to the surrounding journalists. "As 
usual, we were busy with work on that day. Adopted an additional 
decision on procedures for use of public transportation--free 
for city residents. Were putting the final touches on financing 
with respect to sanitation cleanup of the city. There were 
numerous financial documents, directives, important papers on my 
desk. And suddenly-- the raid; my office is broken into, door 
kicked off hinges, and a rude "hassle" begins.... They dragged 
me out of the building head down.... Among the things left in my 
office were documents, my passport, personal effects, 400,000 
rubles issued to me for the election campaign as a candidate for 
kray duma deputy, plus an advance I had received...." 
  Dusk was enveloping the city. Temperatures dropped to 
freezing. Many of those gathered at the mayoralty steps were 
stomping their feet, made short jogs to keep themselves 
warm--the cold was getting to people through spring-season short 
coats and jackets. Many were hatless but were afraid to leave. 
Against the background of the darkened building, the tenth floor 
was brightly lit. In his office, Mayor V.I. Cherepkov was 
bedridden, hooked to an IV. His wife was keeping watch at his 
bedside. The full "illumination" in Gilgenberg's office was easy 
to explain: A search was still under way there. The eyes of the 
people on the street were glued to this strip of light at the 
top. Cars with special license plates were lurking here and 
there around the building. An ambulance with the "03" telephone 
number on the hood. Minivans with tinted windows-- "Black 
Nellies," picket members suspected. 
  In those moments, many felt themselves lost, helpless, 
and.... unneeded. What do you do--shout in the middle of the 
night, in the center of the city getting ready to turn in for 
the night? Demand somebody or something? Deputy mayors, heads of 
rayon administrations were here; together with everyone else, 
shivering in the wind, these people stood outside their office 
building--now unemployed. They had been dismissed from jobs 
without any explanations, practically across the board--new 
bureaucrats, or to be precise, bureaucrats who had formerly held 
these jobs--already had been appointed. The circle had closed; 
the system had regenerated itself, rejecting a "foreign 
body...." Someone in the crowd kept repeating in amazement: "But 
why Tolstoshein? He had nearly the lowest rating during the 
mayoral elections--the people rejected him.... How can he, 
without blinking an eye, take the place of a person still 
there!" But nobody listened to these questions anymore--they 
were academic. 
  "What do you intend to do now?" the indefatigable ones kept 
pressing Gilgenberg. "How will events develop, anyway?" 
  "I remain a deputy to the kray duma. I will be meeting with 
my constituents. If necessary, right on the street. Let people 
see what can be done to the law here...." 
  Cherepkov was carried out from the building at past 0100. 
  "OMON soldiers were carrying the mayor feet first," said 
T.G. 
Romanenko, a candidate for kray duma deputy who kept vigil in 
the building until almost 0300. "There were so many people in 
camouflage uniforms that you could not see Cherepkov 
himself--only an occasional glimpse of sock-clad feet...." 
  This is how the incident in the mayoralty was carried out. 
Promptly and successfully. In the morning, numerous documents 
were read on the radio, explaining that since the mayor was 
suspected of committing a grave criminal offense (bribes), he 
had been temporarily--until the investigation was 
completed--removed from duty. The "temporary" nature of the act 
of deposing the mayor elected by the people was emphasized in 
the official comments many times. Each step in the seizure of 
the mayoralty was dressed in argumentation. Everything 
apparently exudes legitimacy and only legitimacy. 
  Nevertheless, it was all too thin. "Temporarily" put on the 
sidelines? Then why an equally rash destruction of the entire 
administrative structure created under Cherepkov? Such a hasty 
dismissal of personnel? Have they also been identified wholesale 
as criminals, or at least suspects? Cherepkov had not been able 
for months to get rid of obvious saboteurs--his deputies and 
rayon heads--because of all sorts of procedural red tape. Here, 
however, several minutes were enough--exactly as long as it 
takes to read out the personnel "sentence." 
  And also, there is this disturbing bravura march, the 
coronation speech on the occasion of the mew mayor assuming his 
duties. It was as if a magic tablecloth had been spread before 
the stunned city residents--transportation, dacha, merchandise, 
social and charitable goodies.... Which horn of abundance did it 
all come from? In what warehouses had it all been hidden from 
the city residents, exhausted by adversity? What billions and 
millions are behind it? If only this could all be true. Except 
that somehow one feels sad at this promised feast....

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Kutenkikh, Aleksandr Maltsev, Andrey </F>
Ostrovskiy, Vyacheslav Voyakin, and Yuriy Maltsev, VLADIVOSTOK: 
"As the Mayor Was Being Removed, the City Was Watching `Just 
Maria.' On the Evening of 16 March, Viktor Cherepkov Was 
Relieved of the Position of the Mayor of Vladivostok, and 
Konstantin Tolstoshein Was Appointed Acting Mayor"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's issue of VLADIVOSTOK reported 
rumors circulating in the city concerning the inevitable removal 
of Viktor Cherepkov on Wednesday, 16 March. Our prediction 
turned out to be accurate. 
  On 16 March, at approximately 1800 hours, Deputy Governors 
Igor Lebedinets (the acting supreme official of the kray in view 
of Yevgeniy Nazdratenko's attending a meeting of the Federation 
Council in Moscow) and Alfred Gartman appeared at the building 
of the administration of Vladivostok. They announced the removal 
of the mayor of Vladivostok, Viktor Cherepkov, from his position 
and the appointment of Konstantin Tolstoshein as the acting head 
of the administration of Vladivostok. The latter has previously 
held the job of chairman of the committee for industry of the 
kray administration, and prior to that--head of the 
administration of Pervorechenskiy Rayon of the city. 
  From this moment on, the events began to develop that were 
witnessed by a team of VLADIVOSTOK journalists who worked 
between 1800 and 0400 hours in the area of the White and Gray 
Houses, as well as Cherepkov's apartment. 
  Upon returning to his office, Igor Lebedinets informed a 
VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that at 1700 hours, Deputy Procurator 
of Frunzenskiy Rayon Aleksandr Vysotskiy had signed a decree to 
relieve Cherepkov from his position. This document had been 
ratified by Kray Procurator Valeriy Vasilenko, as well as 
cleared by the kray court. The latter procedure was legally 
necessary in view of the fact that Viktor Cherepkov is a 
candidate for deputy of the kray duma. 
  As far as the decree itself is concerned, it said the 
following on the basis of the records of criminal case No. 
474731 on the charges against V.I. Cherepkov under Article 173, 
part 3, of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (taking a 
bribe): "V.I. Cherepkov has been charged with accepting from 
citizen V.N. Volkov a bribe in a particularly large amount, in 
the form of a Swiss-made Omega wristwatch worth 2,762,100 rubles 
[R], while working as the head of the Vladivostok 
administration, on 6 February 1994, in his official suite No. 
1001 at the building of the city administration at 20 Ocean 
Avenue, for a positive decision in favor of Volkov concerning 
the transfer to him under a lease of premises from the 
nonresidential stock of municipal property for an office of the 
Vikhr Moscow association of internationalist soldiers. ....On 10 
February 1994, V.I. Cherepkov received a bribe in a particularly 
large amount from Volkov in the form of R3 million for the 
previously rendered service in transferring the office premises 
under a lease...." 
  The document also stresses that it became necessary to 
remove 
V.I. Cherepkov from his position given that the position held by 
him may interfere with establishing the truth in the case. 
  From 1800 hours on, the building of the city administration 
was blockaded by UVD [Internal Affairs Directorate] 
functionaries. They began to clear the building of staff 
employees and visitors. Some of the latter locked themselves in 
their offices, and for this reason some doors were broken down. 
The militia also had to break down the door to the mayor's 
office, which had prudently been locked from the inside. 
Nonetheless, as the spouse of the mayor, Valentina Cherepkova, 
and the former city manager Vladimir Gilgenberg testified, 
Alfred Gartman, who entered the office first, behaved in an 
exceptionally proper manner, stating that he had come there 
primarily as a physician. 
  Between approximately 1800 and 2100 hours, the key 
supporters 
of Cherepkov--V. Gilgenberg, S. Dolotov, T. Romanenko, S. 
Shokolenko, G. Petrachkov, and V. Kalenik--left the building on 
a coercively voluntary basis. By this time, no more than 50 
people were gathered on the grounds and the steps in front of 
the Gray House; half of them were activists of the so-called 
"Association of Vladivostok Voters," and half were journalists. 
All attempts to break through into the building were stopped by 
UVD functionaries who, in the estimation of observers, operated 
mainly within the bounds of the law "On the Militia" (including 
the use of force to put an end to unlawful actions and actions 
interfering with the performance of official duties of the 
militia). 
  At approximately 2130 hours, it became known that the newly 
appointed mayor had demanded that V.I. Cherepkov leave the 
office and the building by 0030 hours. However, this event 
occurred at 0115 hours, when the door swung open, and people in 
plainclothes, flanked by a group of baton-wielding militia 
functionaries, carried the dismissed mayor out of the building. 
  The hysterical condition of the elderly admirers of Viktor 
Ivanovich, who suspected the worst, rose to its heights. A wild 
crush and swarm and shouting ensued--all of this went on for 
five to seven minutes, until Cherepkov was placed in an 
ambulance, which was immediately cordoned off by a double circle 
of OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] combatants. 
Several minutes later, the wife of the former mayor, who was 
holding up quite courageously, got into the car, and the 
ambulance moved almost right away in the direction of 
Cherepkov's house on Kalinin Street. 
  Upon arrival at the destination, Galina Gordiyenko, the 
physician of the ambulance team who had observed Viktor 
Ivanovich for a few of the last hours in the office, stated in a 
conversation with a VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that Cherepkov had 
a pronounced stress condition and stenocardia. She categorically 
denied information disseminated in front of the Gray House 
concerning an infarction that the "retiree" had supposedly had. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  At approximately 2030 on 16 March, City Manager Vladimir 
Gilgenberg, by then the former city manager, left the Gray 
House. However, he did not do so on his own, but rather with 
assistance from militia functionaries. One hour to an hour and a 
half later, a VLADIVOSTOK journalist met with Vladimir 
Andreyevich among his supporters, next to the building of the 
city administration and asked him a few questions. 
  [Journalist] Has violence been used by the militia against 
you? 
  [Gilgenberg] Of course, I was not beaten up, but I was 
driven 
out of the office. I was not allowed to remain by the side of 
the legitimately elected mayor and was bounced off the premises. 
  [Journalist] They say that you called Moscow. 
  [Gilgenberg] Yes. I notified the leadership of the State 
Duma; they promised to take up our issue as early as Thursday. I 
talked to the leader of one of the factions, but for now I will 
not say which one. 
  [Journalist] Did you foresee the forthcoming events? 
  [Gilgenberg] Yes, in principle. Backstage scheming had begun 
as early as Monday. Incidentally, it was precisely on Monday 
that I became acting mayor; after all, Viktor Ivanovich took 
sick leave, apparently on account of microfocal myocardial 
infarction. The kray administration picked the time quite 
fortuitously. Yeltsin was in Sochi, Nazdratenko was in Moscow, 
and who was procurator general was altogether unclear. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  The newspaper VLADIVOSTOK became the first publication to 
which the new leader of the city administration, Konstantin 
Tolstoshein, gave an interview. This happened at 0300 hours on 
17 March. 
  [Journalist] Konstantin Borisovich, when did you learn about 
your appointment? 
  [Tolstoshein] In all honesty? On Wednesday, at 1730 hours. I 
was working at the kray administration (Tolstoshein's previous 
position was that of the chairman of the committee for industry 
of the kray administration) when it was proposed that I head the 
municipality of Vladivostok. 
  [Journalist] Did you agree right away? 
  [Tolstoshein] Yes, I did not hesitate any on this point. The 
city needs to be rescued. Look what they have done to 
Vladivostok-- it is a pain and a shame. There is dirt, lack of 
care, the breakdown of the economy and transportation, lack of 
social protection for many of the almost 800,000 inhabitants of 
the city, and other woes. 
  [Journalist] What will you work on first of all? 
  [Tolstoshein] Four areas will have priority: a cleanup in 
the 
city with the hygiene and disease control service, housing and 
communal management, and other subdivisions participating; the 
operation of public transportation, especially in conjunction 
with the coming of the recreational season; an analysis of the 
operation of the committee for property management and 
assistance to low- income citizens, families with many children, 
veterans of the Great Patriotic War, the war in Afghanistan, and 
those in other hot spots. Finally, we should begin preparations 
for the forthcoming winter heating season as early as Thursday, 
including financing, material and technical supplies, and 
solutions to similar problems. 
  [Journalist] Attention will certainly be paid to personnel 
policy, will it not? 
  [Tolstoshein] It goes without saying. The city 
administration 
was bloated to an impossible size and, accordingly, wages 
claimed a tremendous amount of funds from our budget. We will 
emphasize professionals rather than political scientists, disc 
jockeys, and historians along with psychics. Some five or six 
deputy mayors will remain instead of the current 13, although 
nobody intends to make this into a dogma. As early as 2000 hours 
on 16 March, I signed a decree on firing the city manager and 
similar officials. Knowledgeable people will come to replace 
them. For example, Vladimir Terekhov, the chief of the 
organization and inspection directorate of the kray 
administration, will become a deputy mayor. 
  The institution of rayons will be restored, with greater 
independence being granted to them, but also with greater 
requirements. We had to dismiss the old heads appointed by my 
predecessor. Viktor Pletnev and Sergey Zhurmilov have returned 
to replace them in Pervomayskiy and Leninskiy Rayons. Viktor 
Goncharov and Aleksandr Avdeyev have been appointed to 
Pervorechenskiy and Frunzenskiy Rayons. For now, Deputy Head of 
the Administration Tamara Vadilyeva will discharge the 
responsibilities of the head of Sovetskiy Rayon (Sergey Fil is 
studying at an academy). 
  [Journalist] Who put the functionaries of law enforcement 
organs at your disposal? 
  [Tolstoshein] Militia functionaries were provided through 
the 
channels of the kray and city UVD's. Legality was fully upheld, 
especially as far as the removal of the former mayor from his 
position is concerned. 
  [Journalist] Why was City Procurator Vyacheslav Yaroshenko 
absent? 
  [Tolstoshein] I invited him that evening. However, he said 
he 
was sick and did not show up at the Gray House. 
  [Journalist] How would you comment on the fact that Viktor 
Cherepkov was hand-carried out of the office? 
  [Tolstoshein] I tried to explain to Viktor Ivanovich and his 
wife, Valentina Petrovna, that the office of the head of the 
city administration does not belong personally to Cherepkov, 
Tolstoshein, Ivanov, or Petrov; it is the place where the mayor 
works. If one is sick, he should receive treatment at home or in 
the hospital. At first, Valentina Petrovna asked for three 
hours, and then until the morning. An ambulance had to be called 
three times. 
  In summation, I would like to say that the time of political 
demarches and a confrontation between the city administration 
and the kray administration is over. The time of tedious work 
has begun.

representative of Russian Republican Party Maritime Kray 
organization and authorized representative of candidates to kray 
duma V.I. Cherepkov and T.G. Romanenko, under the "An Eyewitness 
Account" rubric: "Lebedinets and Tolstoshein Took the Mayoralty 
by Storm"] 
  [Text] A roundtable at the UTRO ROSSII editorial offices 
was interrupted by an agitated female voice: The mayoralty is 
under attack. But.... the mayoralty was not stormed for 
another.... 15-20 minutes. They began at 1814: An OMON [Special 
Designation Militia Detachment] detachment poured out from a 
couple of dozen cars and, having easily pushed aside the women 
at the entrance, stomped to the 10th floor. The door to the 
mayor's office was broken down (this is the way they probably 
"seize" apartments?). Women were dragged out of the building by 
the arm. I personally saw V.A. Gilgenberg, for the third day the 
acting mayor (the mayor himself is ill) being thrown out of the 
building; in the process the metal door was thrown open by 
Gilgenberg's head squeezed under the arm of a powerfully built 
OMON soldier. The whole operation was directed personally by 
Lebedinets, who had announced the dismissal of the mayor on the 
grounds of criminal proceedings initiated against him and the 
appointment of a new mayor--Tolstoshein, and his deputy 
Terekhov. Attorney Ulitskiy was not permitted to visit Cherepkov. 
  At 0100 the pickets and journalists who gathered at the 
mayoralty became witnesses and participants in the concluding 
part of the operation: An OMON group, pushing their way through 
the crowd, carried out V.I. Cherepkov; his face was a strange 
green color and lifeless. The mayor was placed into an ambulance 
surrounded by militiamen, which then took him and his wife home. 
The small apartment quickly filled with people (it had not 
occurred to our mayor to get for himself a larger apartment 
while he was in power). The ambulance physician apologized--she 
was only carrying out orders. She recalled what a good doctor 
Gartman used to be. Now this participant in the operation 
approved the "transfer" of the patient that night. Which means 
that Gartman used to be a doctor; who he is now is not for us to 
judge. Among those watching the proceedings from the mayoralty's 
steps was a militia officer and some imposing figure in a 
"macho" black coat. I asked him to introduce himself but got no 
answer. I was told this actually was Tolstoshein. 
  At the same time, in a classic Bolshevik manner, they went 
after rayons where new heads of administration were installed. 
Head of Pervorechenskiy Rayon A.V. Kuchinskiy had his official 
car--some "land-cruiser" that before then had served 
Tolstoshein--confiscated while he was riding in it. The coup was 
now complete. 
  People we called in the State Duma assured us that this was 
all illegal. That opening a door with a man's head is illegal is 
obvious even without the Duma. That a sick man is "treated" by 
OMON is inhuman. That on the eve of elections all this is done 
to candidates is a mockery of the recently adopted Constitution. 
All together it is a slap in the face of the city, all of us. 
People may have different feelings about the mayor and his 
supporters, but when the law is trampled so brazenly, openly, it 
means that no one is safe-- tomorrow they can use the head of 
any of us as a battering ram. Kray Procurator V.V. Vasilenko 
postponed a telephone conversation regarding candidates' rights 
until tomorrow, and denied his part in the operation--it is the 
investigator, he said. Someone among the "bearers" told 
Gilgenberg that the "kray court had concurred" on the action. 
  The militia--dozens of cars and about 100 participants--have 
demonstrated its might and drive. Would it not be nice if they 
used all this might against racketeers, apartment burglars, and 
pickpockets--Vladivostok would be safer than Lillehamer. 
  Office windows lit up one after another at the mayoralty's 
floors; S.P. Goryacheva probably will now have more material for 
new denunciations of the trashed mayoralty. There was no concern 
for observing due process--it is not necessary to comply with 
its norms during a coup. What to do, everybody will now decide 
for himself. But we do have to turn out for elections. And vote 
in such a way that would deprive the party of the nomenklatura 
coup from getting the votes--at least in our city.

  [Text] Lithuanian Premier Adolfas Slezevisius said at a 
meeting with the head of the Kaliningrad regional administration 
Yuriy Matochkin and Commander of the Russian Baltic Fleet 
Admiral Vladimir Yegorov in Vilnius on Tuesday that the 
Lithuanian Government is interested in the successful 
fulfillment of the program for the construction of housing in 
the Kaliningrad Region for the Russian military pulled out of 
the Baltic states. 
  As the press secretary of the Lithuanian Government Viktoras 
Baublys told Interfax, the meeting focused on the consequences 
for the housing construction program of the arrest of the 
president of the Lithuanian construction company Selma. 
  Selma's president Vladas Laurinavicius was arrested last 
Thursday while the Prosecutor's Office searched homes of those 
suspected of machinations with the purchase of arms from the 
Russian military by the Ministry of Home Defense. 
Laurinavicius, former prisoner, was a mediator during these 
operations. His company "Selma" is building housing for the 
Russian military in the Kaliningrad region under an agreement 
with Russia. 
  On Friday Laurinavicius was scheduled to meet with the 
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who was then visiting 
Kaliningrad. 
  It was agreed in Vilnius that on Thursday, Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Lithuania Vladislovas Domarkas and government 
officials would pay a visit to Kaliningrad. They will assess 
the situation with the construction of housing for the Russian 
military and determine if there is a need for the Lithuanian 
Government's interference in the process.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Voytovich, Belarusian ambassador </F>
extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania, by Algimantas 
Brazaitis in Vilnius; date not given: "Tied Scores Are Most 
Important for Diplomats" -- questions published in boldface; 
first paragraph is TIESA introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Yevgeniy Voytovich, former chief of the 
"Belarusfilm" studio and the Belarusian State Cinematographic 
Committee of many years, and the current ambassador to 
Lithuania, gave an interview for TIESA. He spoke with reporter 
Algimantas Brazaitis, former chairman of the Lithuanian 
Cinematographic Committee. 
  [Brazaitis] Welcome to Lithuania. We, the former colleagues, 
used to meet in Vilnius quite often. However, I would call this 
meeting the first one due to your different position -- you are 
the first Belarusian envoy to independent Lithuania. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Voytovich] I am convinced that we will preserve the 
tradition of friendship. The first indicator was the cultural 
agreement between Belarus and Lithuania as independent states, 
which I had the honor to sign with Dainius Trinkunas, your 
minister of culture and education. 
  [Brazaitis]This agreement was really the first sign of 
spring. However, after changing your position from the 
Belarusian minister of culture to that of the first Belarusian 
envoy to Lithuania, you will have to develop most diverse 
relations. How do you imagine this mission and the future of 
Lithuanian-Belarusian interstate relations? 
  [Voytovich] Any civilized state, and I believe 
unconditionally that Lithuania and Belarus are such countries, 
gives priority to its relations with the closest neighbors. 
This is particularly vital to our nations with long-standing 
friendship and similar fates. Due to their position in the 
center of Europe and a peculiar buffer role between the East and 
the West, they have experienced many crucial ordeals. [passage 
omitted] 
  Having achieved independence, our nations are creating 
democratic European states. In this case, the goals of Belarus 
and Lithuania coincide. We have mutual interest from the 
geopolitical and economic viewpoint. Our state has no access to 
the sea, while the shortest road to a Baltic port runs across 
your country. Your most direct transit routes to Ukraine, 
Russia, and other Eastern states run through Belarus. Those 
countries have a vast economic potential and boundless markets. 
  There are several other factors promoting cooperation and 
providing chances for mutual benefit of our nations. 
  While presenting my credentials to His Excellency Lithuanian 
President Algirdas Brazauskas, I stated: I believe that my key 
and strategic goal and spiritual vocation as a Belarusian envoy 
to the Republic of Lithuania is to do everything possible in 
developing and strengthening our constant political and economic 
relations. I am ready to keep my word. 
  [Brazaitis]Your persistence deserves respect. I know 
your friendly attitude toward Lithuania which you demonstrate in 
resolving the problems of cultural cooperation. However, some 
politicians caused a commotion when you called Vilnius the 
capital of Belarus in the Belarusian paper ZVYAZDA. 
  [Voytovich] While giving an interview for this paper, I 
spoke 
about historical, cultural, and spiritual relations between our 
nations. I really stated that Vilnius was also the capital of 
the Belarusians in the past. Our nations lived in the same 
state and had one capital -- Vilnius -- during the times of the 
Grand Dutchy of Lithuania. 
  I am convinced that history unites rather than divides us. 
There was not the slightest hint in this phrase that I claimed 
your beloved capital. Other interpretations of my words are 
incorrect. I even stressed in the same interview that "all 
issues must be resolved following the provision of the Helsinki 
Final Act on the inviolability of borders in post-war Europe. 
In my new office, I will place emphasis on mentality and a 
peaceful attitude -- the traits typical of both nations. At the 
same time, I will execute the conceptual policy of my parliament 
and the government." This is exactly what was said and written. 
  [Brazaitis]Could you tell us a few words about 
Adutiskis? This issue is still being discussed in the 
Lithuanian and Belarusian press and politicians' offices. 
  [Voytovich] A problem does exist. However, I would request 
reporters not to dramatize this situation. Emotions and strong 
words are only an obstacle. A bilateral commission is working 
on the delineation of the border, and it has already 
accomplished much. The positions of the two parties have 
differed even in 40 cases. However, following the principles of 
parity in international relations and of the established use of 
land, we have found a solution. I hope that by working in this 
manner, the commission will find a solution for the Adutiskis 
railway station acceptable to both parties. 
  [Brazaitis]Mr. Ambassador, while representing the 
interests of the state, one must bear in mind the political 
forces and consider relations between the ruling group and the 
opposition in one's country. What could you tell TIESA readers 
about such most prominent political leaders as V. Kebich, S. 
Shushkevich, and Z. Poznyak? 
  [Voytovich] [passage omitted] I assess all the persons you 
have listed as normal statesmen and politicians. I am convinced 
that there can be no civilized state without an opposition. 
Certainly, I wish the latter were less emotional and angry and 
more objective, and had more arguments. 
  The upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections will 
show the weight and recognition of political forces among the 
population. 
  [Brazaitis]Yevgeniy Konstantinovich, our readers would 
like to learn more about you. 
  [Voytovich] I was born in a village near Minsk. I graduated 
from a technical school and an institute. I also finished 
postgraduate studies. I am a master of economics. 
  My work record is rather vivid -- from a metal worker to a 
minister and an envoy. I wish I had been a teacher. 
Pedagogical experience would be very useful now. 
  I am fond of theater, music, and art. I also read fiction, 
but I prefer historical novels. I play chess. What about a 
game? I promise a tied score. 
  [Brazaitis]Thank you. I understand that tied scores are the 
most valuable victories for diplomats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys by </F>
Algimantas Zukas in Vilnius; date not given: "Treaty -- Only 
Favorable Background for Relations"] 
  [Text] [Zukas] We have met to discuss the political 
Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty that has already been 
prepared, but that remains to be signed. You just returned from 
Germany. I think that the treaty, the preparation of which has 
taken so much time, was also remembered there. 
  [Gylys] I realized that the news about a breakthrough in our 
negotiations was received favorably. Germany's signing of the 
state agreement with Poland was more painful. By the way, they 
could speak about ethnic borders, as some people are fond of 
saying in our country, not only with Poland but also, let us 
say, with France. I think, however, that the future agreement 
is a proper move in removing historical misunderstandings. 
  [Zukas] Let us try to assess this treaty from the 
geopolitical viewpoint then. Do you think that this is an 
overly high level? 
  [Gylys] No, your question is timely. We often reason in 
categories of inner patriotism: How can I, as a Lithuanian, 
agree that there are also Lithuanians beyond Lithuania's 
borders, but not guarantee that they will be together with me. 
When defending state interests, one must see not only domestic 
events but one must also understand the surrounding world and 
even the danger of finding ourselves under siege. We must 
abandon the enemy image created by the opponents of the treaty. 
This might seem like patriotism and the protection of state 
interests, but it looks more like sabotage on second thought. 
If we do not introduce order in our relations, we will not be 
attractive to businessmen, and it will be difficult and unreal 
to think about the integration with Europe. Talks on the 
associate agreement with the European Union [EU] are beginning 
in the second half of this year -- we must put things in order 
by that time. The EU reprimands us for ethnic minorities [as 
published], and the foreign army is absent from our country -- 
these are the great advantages. The only problem that remains 
is the normalization of relations. 
  [Zukas] Does the signing of this treaty mean that General L. 
Zeligowski's problem has already been solved, or that it will 
reemerge in diplomatic and ruling circles? 
  [Gylys] We reached an agreement while negotiating that we 
would be able to discuss this issue in the future, because we 
are democratic states, or at least we are trying to become such. 
Discussions will certainly not subside. They might involve 
primarily historians. I suppose that we must resort to measures 
and principles typical of modern times. Europe of the 21th 
century will be different. Problems that are so important to us 
now will probably look quite different then. 
  [Zukas] How then, could you explain the constant "friction" 
with the opposition over this treaty? 
  [Gylys] I see two reasons -- the gnoseological and the 
psychological, that is, how people understand this issue. I 
think that most of these people really wish the state well. 
They want Lithuania to make moves which, in their opinion, are 
beneficial to it. No one can deprive these people of the right 
to have their own views. However, the responsibility for 
managing the state falls on the government. Each government has 
problems. We must resolve the following dilemma now: Either we 
have no treaty, or we have such an agreement that is possible at 
the moment. In my opinion, the first option is worse. 
  [Zukas] Speaking about the gnoseological reason, that is, 
the 
one linked with the knowledge of specific details, however, you 
should agree that no one has really seen the treaty. Nor have 
those people, who are picketing at the ministry's entrance today 
and who have promised to rally at other government doors in the 
future, read it. 
  [Gylys] I discern another -- political -- reason here. I 
understand that many ordinary people do not realize what issues 
are present or absent in the treaty. However, politicians know 
its contents quite well. Both sides have expressed the 
essential items. 
  [Zukas] It would be important then to learn your opinion 
on Mr. Ozolas' [Seimas deputy, leader of the Center Union] 
statements concerning not only the treaty but also the Polish 
ambassador [allegations of Widacki's possible cooperation with 
former Polish secret services]. This seems to have caused 
particular tensions, even though Poland did not react to Mr. 
Ozolas' statements as seriously as it usually does. 
  [Gylys] I think that this was a politically irresponsible 
move. I was simply shocked by Ozolas' article. He insulted not 
only Mr. Widacki, but also Germany and Russia. Everything is 
generalized -- the author speaks about nations. He berates the 
West and the EU "a priori" only because they might back this 
treaty. The author maintains that we have met most Polish 
claims to Lithuania's sovereignty in its southeastern and 
eastern regions. Why such a conclusion? R. Ozolas states 
openly that we must claim the territories of the neighboring 
states. The reason might be that some of our politicians have 
become accustomed to acting without feedback, they have 
criticized and struck since 1988. We know from cybernetics that 
a system without feedback loses the link with reality. 
  [Zukas] I have a few specific questions. When will the 
treaty be initialed? This seems to be your duty. Is talk about 
President Walesa's visit to Lithuania to sign the ratified 
treaty grounded? 
  [Gylys] The treaty will be initialed very soon, within some 
10 days. During our visit to Warsaw, we expect to learn the 
date of President Walesa's visit to the capital of Lithuania. 
We are looking forward to his visit. I think that this will be 
a very important and symbolic visit of the Polish leader to 
Lithuania. 
  [Zukas] Do you not think that L. Walesa will be welcomed 
with 
posters, pickets, and all other "symbols of the sacred religion?" 
  [Gylys] We are a nation of peasants, and the majority of us 
realize how important it is to get along with neighbors. 
  [Zukas] What should be the next move after the signing of 
the 
bilateral treaty? 
  [Gylys] We discussed this with Polish Foreign Minister 
Olechowski. It would be very good to organize a "round table" 
with the participation of politicians, businessmen, and bankers. 
We would specify our relations and point out the "weak points." 
I think that we must accomplish much in regulating our border 
and customs services. The free trade agreement was drafted back 
last April. In my opinion, Polish politicians sincerely seek 
definite cooperation. While I was travelling to Budapest via 
Warsaw, Minister Olechowski himself came to the airport, 
although he had promised to send his deputy. The foreign 
minister offered definite assistance in preparing for 
negotiations with the EU on free trade: "We know the process of 
negotiations and all the difficulties, and we are ready to share 
our experience with you." I stress once again: A political 
treaty means a favorable political background for definite 
relations. Our current relations are definite but not perfect 
due to the unfavorable background. 
  [Zukas] Thank you for the interview.

  [Text] The Lithuanian Embassy in the Russian Federation 
announced that a meeting of the Lithuanian group for the 
negotiations with the CIS countries and of the Russian 
negotiating delegation, which started yesterday, ended in Moscow 
today. 
  A draft inter-governmental agreement on the border crossing 
points between Lithuania and Russia was initialled during the 
meeting. The Lithuanian delegation submitted a list of debts to 
Lithuanian enterprises and organizations unpaid by the Russian 
Army leaving Lithuania. The Lithuanian delegation demanded that 
Russia fulfill the agreements signed last year where it was 
obliged to open a Lithuanian elementary school in Moscow. In 
addition, the Lithuanian delegation stressed that Lithuanian 
communities in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and some Siberian towns 
should be accommodated. 
  The delegations stated that the speediest coming into force 
of the Lithuanian-Russian agreements on trade and economic 
relations would help the development of mutual relations. 
[passage indistinct] At the next meeting the Lithuanian 
delegation will again propose that the return of archives 
removed from Lithuania be discussed. The delegation is 
returning to Vilnius tonight.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Lashkevich: "Lithuanian Nationalists Do </F>
Not Want Agreement With Poland"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- A treaty between Lithuania and Poland, 
ready for signing at the highest level, has been unexpectedly 
subjected to a harsh propaganda attack by right-wing radicals 
and nationalists in Lithuania. 
  In the last few days, they have organized a whole series of 
protest pickets and gatherings by ultra-patriots with 
resolutions containing the old demand for the mandatory mention 
in the treaty's preamble of the so-called "Zeligowski march on 
Vilnius," as a result of which, for over 20 years, the 
Lithuanian capital of Vilnius was called the city of Wilno and 
was the center of the East Polish province. 
  A patriotic furor was raised by Romualdas Ozolas, leader of 
the Centrist Alliance party and member of the Seimas, who is 
also one of Lithuania's most influential politicians. Known for 
his territorial claims against Kaliningrad Oblast and suspicion 
toward neighboring Belorussia [Belarus], he reacted extremely 
negatively to the preliminary results of talks between the 
Lithuanian Foreign Ministry and the Poles, and to the ministry's 
pragmatic stance -- namely, not to make historical appraisals 
but to limit itself to a recognition of the inviolability of 
borders, as is the accepted practice throughout the world. In 
the midst of the arguments, the leader of the Lithuanian 
centrists even named the Polish ambassador in Vilnius as a 
secret service staffer (later, the Belorussian ambassador in 
Lithuania was also credited with this "flattering" 
characteristic). 
  A scandal broke. The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry was obliged 
to express regret over such appraisals and interpretations of 
the treaty. At this point, representatives of certain 
right-wing organizations and movements came to the aid of the 
chief Lithuanian patriot. Picketing of the Foreign Ministry, 
the Seimas, and the president's residence began. A propaganda 
campaign was launched in the newspapers. The Lithuanian Foreign 
Ministry made a statement noting in particular: The country's 
state interests are reflected in the draft treaty, and its text 
will not be published before signing -- in line with a decree of 
the Lithuanian Government on the nonpublication of treaties 
being prepared for signing, and which are on the same footing as 
state secrets. The Foreign Ministry recalled that, as a rule, 
the competence of the foreign policy department is verified 
during the ratification in parliament of agreements prepared by 
diplomats. 
  In all probability, official Vilnius will not fall under the 
thumb of local nationalists. President Algirdas Brazauskas is 
determined to sign this treaty, which is so important for both 
countries. A telephone conversation on this subject took place 
between him and Polish President Lech Walesa, and both leaders 
expressed support for the bilateral agreement. 
  On the other hand, the Lithuanian authorities realize that 
the national radicals, by playing the Polish card, are not in 
the least concerned about state security, but rather about 
political advantage. In an effort to rock the atmosphere in the 
country, the ruling Democratic Labor Party believes, they are 
prepared even to rouse the dissatisfaction of the local Poles 
densely populating South East Lithuania. Therefore, the ruling 
majority is unlikely to allow the initiative to be snatched back 
by those who strive for power through any means. The 
authorities will firmly stand their ground, otherwise the 
nationalists may spoil everthing -- relations with Poland, and 
relations with the local Poles.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 21, ELTA -- Chairman of Debt 
management department of the Ministry of Finance Ruta Skyriene 
has partly confirmed the last-week statement of Prime Minister 
Adolfas Slezevicius which said "rendering of credits to 
Lithuania were suspended". 
  Skyriene said until there was some dimness in the system of 
Lithuanian banks, credits are suspended but not cancelled. 
  Workers of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank 
Vilnius bureaus confirmed the information. Head of World Bank 
Baltic states subunit Vilnius department Ramune Zabuliene said 
the bank "did not suspend any project" and added that 
"implementation of the project of restructuring of enterprises 
and financial sector is being protracted". 
  Skyriene said until new banking laws corresponding to 
international standards are not approved, process of 
bankruptcies is not actually realized and a prospect of Currency 
Board remains vague, problems with credits may remain. 
  Statements of the economic memorandum oblige the government 
to present the parliament laws of Central bank and commercial 
banks, to change law of bankruptcies and to present the law "On 
the creation of a specialized bankruptcy court". Such a court 
should be established before transferring the second part of EEC 
loan. 
  Officials of international institutions are not directly 
linking the suspension of credits with creation of the Currency 
Board. IMF is interested not in the Currency Board itself but 
in the results of the reforms, and inflation rate -- first of 
all, as it now exceeds the allowed level. 
  Up to March 21, international institutions have lent 
Lithuania 454 million U.S. dollars, 292 million of them have 
been already used.

  [Text] Vilnius, March 21, ELTA -- "We want to know 
together with the society if an oil terminal is to be built in 
Butinge", member of Seimas Motherland' Union faction Alfonsas 
Vaisnoras told a news conference on Monday [21 March]. He 
commented the memorandum of March 16 on the delay of the 
construction of the terminal. The memorandum was addressed to 
the President Algirdas Brazauskas by the Union of Motherland 
/Lithuanian Conservatives/. 
  Vaisnoras said a lot of political groups were interested 
that 
the object of vital importance to Lithuania was not built. In 
recent times, ways of development of Liepaja oil terminal are 
often discussed. He said these ways were unacceptable as an 
alternative because Latvian-Russian political relations became 
complicated and oil artery from Russia may be broken off. 
  Eimantas Dragunevicius, chairman of energy committee of 
Motherland' Union, who also participated in the news conference, 
said that Lithuania's situation in energy is worse than 
Estonia's or Latvia's, that's why the problem of the terminal is 
so important. 
  Dragunevicius also criticized intentions of the Ministry of 
Energy to privatize five biggest objects of Lithuanian energy 
system. It should not be done until the property is not indexed.

some of the old spiritual values. Celebration of Navruz, is the 
sign of firmness of the eternal values: peace, friendship, and 
labor. Reforms that we have started a few years ago are aimed 
at building the society where everyone will get the chance of 
fulfilling himself and securing adequate life for himself and 
for his family. All of us should understand that prosperity of 
every member of our society would result in the prosperity of 
the state. This should become our state policy. We have made 
the first steps in building our state. We have adopted the 
Constitution, created the legal basis for its functioning, and 
introduced the national currency. Now we are facing a task of 
taking some other steps on this path. This is not possible 
without your support and understanding. The most important 
thing for us to understand is that we, by working hard, can 
overcome the difficulties. 
  I have signed a number of decrees aimed at strengthening 
financial discipline and upgrading tax system and combatting 
crime and land reform. I believe that only discipline and order 
on the one hand and freedom on the other will compliment each 
other and lead to success. We are doing everything so as [word 
indistinct] and setting firmly on the path of socio-economic and 
spiritual development. We can overcome all these difficulties 
provided we act in accordance with the best Navruz traditions 
during which wars are banned, people tend to forgive each other 
for mistakes. We are optimistic about the future of our land. 
  Kyrgyzstan has all the conditions and means for achieving 
the 
set tasks. And the main of them is the intellectual potential 
which has been accumulated by our nation during all these years. 
  We will change life for better. There will be day when every 
house and every family will be prosperous and certain of its 
tomorrow. I believe that Kyrgyzstanis, when celebrating this 
holiday, will remember the noble traditions of their ancestors 
and consolidate principles of unity, accord, and peace that have 
been proclaimed at the kurultay of the people of Kyrgyzstan and 
strengthen by this friendship, fraternity, and cooperation 
between people of Kyrgyzstan. We have achieved a lot on this 
path, and it's our task to continue the kind traditions of our 
ancestors. Let the spirit of the festival of all the times and 
nations of Asia give us [words industinct]. Dear compatriots, I 
congratulate you on Navruz festival, I wish you happiness and 
peace. Akayev, president of Kyrgyzstan.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Rotar under the "Interlocutor" rubric: </F>
Askar Akayev Likes NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA and Is Tolerant of 
Criticism"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] During our nearly two-hour 
conversation, the Kyrgyzstan president managed to shake my 
skepticism somewhat about the future of Russians in his country. 
Sadly, my interlocutor asked me not to turn on the tape 
recorder: "Let it be an unofficial conversation, and you will 
write an article after you have traveled around our country." 
  Yet I managed, not without difficulty, to secure Askar 
Akayevich's consent to publish excerpts from our conversation. 
  Akayev believes that Kyrgyzstan is vitally interested in a 
comfortable existence of the Russian ethnic minority not out of 
only purely humanist considerations. In its ethnic composition, 
Kyrgyzstan differs appreciably from the other Central Asian 
states where Slavs account for a relatively small share (some 10 
percent) of the country's population. Tranquillity in 
Kyrgyzstan rests on a precarious ethnic balance between the 
three most numerous peoples of the state: Kyrgyz (nearly 50 
percent), Uzbeks (more than 10 percent), Russians and Ukrainians 
(nearly 25 percent). In this ethnic "crucible" the Slavic 
component fulfills the role of a stabilizer that maintains 
relations of harmony between the peoples. A massive outflow of 
Slavic people would tip the ethnic balance in the republic, and 
the probability of interethnic clashes would grow sharply. 
[passage omitted] 
  The main reason for the Slav emigration is a low living 
standard. The Kyrgyz leader thinks that Western countries have 
proven in practice totally indifferent to such notions as 
democracy and freedom of speech, and prefer to invest money in 
countries that bring profit. "We are being helped only by 
America and Japan; as for Europe, I do not visit it," Askar 
Akayev added with sadness. As for Kyrgyzstan's neighbors, which 
have much richer natural resources, they are securing credits 
all over the world. 
  The other important specific feature in the life of 
Kyrgyzstan's Slavs is that, unlike their fellow Slavs in the 
other Central Asia states, most of them work for defense. With 
the disintegration of the Soviet Union, virtually all workers of 
the military-industrial complex have been left without a job. 
The Kyrgyz president pins great hopes on an understanding with 
Boris Yeltsin on creating an investment fund to turn the 
enterprises where Slavs work into joint enterprises. "This 
would finally provide jobs for our Slavs, and they would not be 
leaving for Russia," Askar Akayev said. 
  Finally, there is the dual-citizenship problem. In the 
president's view, it can be only granted to local Slavs and 
Germans. The granting of dual citizenship to Uzbeks and Tajiks 
would, Askar Akayev thinks, lead to unpredictable consequences. 
The Kyrgyz president reminded me that Tajikistan had made 
territorial claims on his country not so long ago. If one 
grants dual citizenship to Tajiks, who densely populate areas 
close to the Tajikistan border, there would actually be no 
avoiding a territorial division. 
  A similar problem also exists in Osh Oblast, with a dense 
Uzbek population that borders on Uzbekistan. Askar Akayev 
admitted that in Uzbekistan, too, there are certain forces 
interested in a revision of borders. A similar problem also 
exists in northern Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz president 
appreciates Nursultan Nazarbayev's stance very well. Akayev 
thinks that the best solution in such situations is bilateral 
agreements to guarantee an immediate granting of citizenship 
when one changes the country of residence or decides to go back. 
Let me note that Kazakhstan Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko, 
who visited Moscow last week, came up with almost the same 
initiative. 
  To the "provoking" question from your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent: "What forces in Uzbekistan are interested in 
territorial division when all power in the neighbor state is in 
the hands of one person -- Islam Karimov?," Askar Akayev 
replied: "Islam Karimov holds a very constructive position, and 
we have no differences on this question. However, this problem 
has always been there -- both before Karimov, Nazarbayev, 
Niyazov, Rakhmonov, Akayev, and their time, and it will remain 
after them. We should be very cautious about provoking a 
catastrophe."

first publication center, which is also a center for displaying 
and selling books and periodicals of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, was opened in Bishkek, the capital city of the Republic of 
Kyrgyzstan. At the opening ceremony, attended by the ministers 
of press, culture and education, and also the Muslims' mufti 
[religious leader] and a large group of the Kyrgyz people, our 
country's Education Ministry adviser and the managing director 
of the Al-Hoda international publications, said in a speech: 
Islam and the Iranian culture are the most important factors in 
the cultural link between the two countries. The attraction of 
Islamic culture and civilization is the reason for the interest 
shown by the people of Central Asia in our country's culture. 
  The press minister of Kyrgyzstan, referring to the fact that 
this center is the first cultural center of a foreign country 
opening in Kyrgyzstan, termed it as an important linking bridge 
between Kyrgyzstan and Iran.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Voronkov and Gennadiy </F>
Kulagin] 
  [Text] London March 22 TASS -- The key task at present is 
preservation of peace through the establishment of a global 
system of responsibility. This calls for working out new 
principles of a world order in which both developed and 
developing countries are interested, according to President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who presented his vision of 
the world process to an audience at the British Institute of 
International Relations on Wednesday. 
  The world process is now passing through a crisis following 
the collapse of the former socialist system, Nazarbayev said. 
  He said the development of the post-Soviet space was 
determined by two tendencies. On the one hand, national states 
continue to take shape, and on the other these new independent 
states tend towards integration within the Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
  From the Kazakh leader's viewpoint, time is now ripe for 
reforming the commonwealth with a view to creating a belt of 
stability and security in the region and upgrading the degree of 
predictability of its political evolution. 
  A renovated commonwealth will then be able to play a 
stabilizing role in averting or regulating possible conflicts in 
the region after creating collective peacekeeping forces. 
  This would in turn strengthen substantially the system of 
global security, Nazarbayev predicted. 
  Kazakhstan, jointly with other commonwealth countries and 
first of all with Russia, is already contributing to the 
process. "We consider ourselves to be part of Central Asia and 
the Commonwealth of Independent States, but we are also aware of 
our responsibility for the preservation of stability and 
security in the entire region," the president stressed. 
  "In analyzing processes underway in our country, one should 
not cherish the illusion that we are ready to draw exclusively 
on the system of values worked out in the West. Kazakhstan, 
just as the other commonwealth countries, is passing through a 
stage of transition, and the world must understand that this 
stage is characterized by a lengthy evolution of all institutes, 
first of all political. The collapse of a totalitarian system 
does not automatically lead to a market economy and a full-scale 
democracy. We have to effect modernization in society and the 
state," the president said. 
  Kazakhstan is one of the few former Soviet republics in 
which 
stability has prevailed in recent years, which enables it to 
confidently pursue its economic reform course, Nazarbayev said. 
  The recent elections to the parliament and local governments 
undoubtedly were a success of Kazakhstan's nascent democracy, he 
said. 
  Many countries and international financial organisations 
have 
commented on the substantial headway made by Kazakhstan in its 
switch to a market economy, and its commitment to large-scale 
privatisation, reforms and macro-economic stabilization, 
Nazarbayev recalled. 
  Speaking about priorities in his country's foreign policy 
President Nazarbayev pointed to three basic factors. The first 
one is that Kazakhstan last year joined the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty -- an historic step because the 
republic voluntarily assumed the obligation to eliminate all 
nuclear weapons on its territory. 
  Another factor is Kazakhstan's geopolitical position which 
makes it necessary for the country to stick to a multi-polar 
foreign political orientation. 
  Nazarbayev said his country is prepared to become a centre 
for strengthening security on the Asian continent. This problem 
has acquired a huge significance in the region which is plagued 
by numerous armed conflicts and ranks second after Europe in 
concentration of armed forces and nuclear arms. 
  Nazarbayev reminded his audience that he had proposed in the 
United Nations a plan for the gradual creation of a single 
collective security system for Asia. The first step in this 
direction can be made by convening a conference on interaction 
and confidence-building in Asia, similar to the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
  The president said that one of the basic tasks in the 
foreign 
political sphere is "the creation of a belt of confidence and 
good-neighborliness" along the entire perimeter of Kazakhstan. 
  The third factor is connected with membership of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. "I was and remain a 
supporter of historically-shaped relations of friendship, 
cooperation and mutual understanding, which have been linking 
our peoples through the centuries of our common history", he 
stressed. 
  Kazakhstan consistently supports the idea of economic 
integration within the commonwealth, but there can be no 
question about a return to the past since each republic made its 
final and irrevocable choice in favour of their sovereign 
development. The Commonwealth of Independent States is not a 
state in itself, not a national entity but a natural mechanism 
of regional interaction in the present conditions. "We rely 
first of all on the development of age- old traditional ties 
with Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzia, Turkmenia and Tajikistan and attach 
the greatest significance to cooperation with Russia," the 
president stressed. 
  The system of global responsibility calls for a policy aimed 
at reducing the number of nuclear powers and ensuring regional 
stability based on reasonable compromise and consensus. This is 
a policy Kazakhstan is committed to, Nazarbayev said.

<F P=106> [Pavel Bogomolov report on interview with Kazakhstan's </F>
President Nursultan Nazarbayev in London on 22 March: "Reliance 
on Names Is Wrong"] 
  [Text] Whether the topic of discussion is Russia or any 
other CIS country, the main point right now is to support first 
and foremost not names or personalities but the direction of the 
reforms and the democracy which actually meet the requirements 
of our development. This is what I endeavored to tell our 
British partners in the current meetings and talks on the banks 
of the Thames, Republic of Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev stressed in a brief interview with PRAVDA. 
  Answering my question about the extent to which official 
London is interested in the effect of the "Russian factor" on 
the situation in Kazakhstan and Central Asia, the high-ranking 
guest from Alma-Ata [Almaty] noted that this question is not 
very indicative of current moods in Whitehall. The British 
leadership is making no secret of the fact that in recent days 
the spectrum of its priority interests has noticeably shifted in 
the direction of the conflicting opinions and political 
priorities in Moscow's corridors of power, and of general 
forecasts concerning the immediate future of the vast part of 
the planet which only recently was a united Union. 
  In this context, Nazarbayev stated later on, I have already 
said many times what I want to repeat now: Yes, we need very 
close integration. Integration which is real and lasting, 
unlike now. Incidentally, the CIS must eventually become 
different from what it is now. Not loose and amorphous but 
highly effective, in line with the scale of the tasks facing all 
of us.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Skorokhodov from "Neighboring Foreign </F>
States" roundup: "Kazakhstan -- Morals Will Be Policed"] 
  [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Kazakhstan's government pins 
great hopes on the legal reform program adopted recently by 
President N. Nazarbayev. 
  According to State Counselor K. Suleymenov, there are fewer 
burglars, thiefs, and muggers in the republic now, but 
more...call girls and racketeers. Crime has become an economy 
and a business. Passive work on the part of the internal affairs 
organs, the state counselor believes, is the main reason why 
organized forms of crime have started to flourish in the 
republic. "Unfortunately, gangs have established a strong 
foothold in our country." 
  In view of this Kazakhstan's president signed a decree on 
stepping up the fight against crime. It provides for the 
creation of special investigative groups comprising staffers 
from the Prosecutor's Office and the National Security Committee 
which will fight organized crime. Moreover, the president 
adopted a decision to set up a tax militia. Henceforth in 
Kazakhstan, instead of the notorious LTP's [occupational therapy 
rehabilitation centers], LPU's -- preventive treatment 
establishments -- will come into operation under the Ministry of 
Health. Moreover, in view of the decline of moral standards, a 
morals militia will come into being. Among other things, it will 
deal with the morality of the press.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- Record heavy snow have 
practically paralysed the Baykonur space launching site in 
Kazakhstan and 500 soldiers were daily working to clean the 
roads and railways leading to the launching pads. 
  The snow thickness varied from four to eight metres and 
local 
residents said nothing of the kind had occurred at least during 
the last ten years. 
  The snow delayed the launch of the Progress-22 cargo space 
craft by three days and the blast off which took place on 
Tuesday became possible thanks to two snow-cleaning trains 
dispatched to the Baykonur Cosmodrome by the Russian Ministry 
for Emergency Situations. 
  The snow storm hit the launching site on March 4 and two 
self-propelled railway cars with military personnel were 
"imprisoned" by it for 24 hours. Available snow cleaning 
equipment failed to cope with the task and servicemen at the 
cosmodrome had to use ordinary spades to clean railway tracks. 
  Besides, a fire ruined on March 7 a part of the premises 
situated close to the testing ground where the "Progress" was, 
however the blaze was not the reason for the delay in the blast 
off.

  [Text] Another round of Estonian-Russian inter-state 
negotiations to be held in Moscow on April 5-6 will not be easy, 
the head of the Estonian delegation, Vino Reinart, said in an 
interview with ETA. 
  "First, we would like to know what Russia's position is at 
the next meeting," he said while adding that, hopefully, Russia 
would comply to its responsibility to withdraw forces from 
Estonia by August 31 deadline without pegging it to other 
problems yet to be solved. 
  During the last round of negotiations on March 1-2, Russia 
withdrew its earlier commitment to pull out its forces by August 
31 and neglected to offer another date for negotiations. 
  Following support to Estonia by the Western countries, 
Russia 
proposed another date which Estonia accepted. 
  On answering the question on possible concessions, Reinart 
said the basis for negotiations were Estonia's laws. The 
position of retired Russian military has been an issue of debate 
between the two countries. The question has been dealt with in 
Estonia's Law on Aliens, Reinart said. 
  Under the Law on Aliens, the retired military have no right 
to apply for residence in Estonia, but a following governmental 
decree allows granting them residence permits on individual 
basis. 
  On commenting agreements initialled between Latvia and 
Russia, Reinart said that Latvia was in a more difficult 
position as they lacked respective legislation. Russia, of 
course, hopes that Estonia would amend some of its laws, Reinart 
added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The first MP coming from 
Estonia's Russian-speaking community, Social Democratic Party's 
Sergey Zonov, will start work in the Estonian State Assembly 
(parliament) Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Zonov replaces Ardo Ojasalu, who was appointed the head of 
the country's Tax Department and has to step down as MP, as the 
next candidate on ticket of the 1992 parliamentary elections. 
  Zonov in today's interview with BNS said he was going to aim 
his activity in the parliament toward the adoption of 
legislative acts that would contribute to integration of 
Russian-speakers into Estonia's life and to equal rights in the 
society. 
  In Zonov's words the population in Estonia could be viewed 
as 
divided into five categories: legal citizens of Estonia, those 
applying for Estonian citizenship, those applying for the 
citizenship of some other country, citizens of other countries, 
and those who have to make up their minds yet. Zotov says the 
country's stability will depend on what will be the official 
policy toward the last of these five categories. 
  He said it was essential for Estonia that as many as 
possible 
of those still making up their minds would choose to apply for 
Estonian citizenship. In order to achieve this, it is 
necessary, beside other things, to better inform people about 
the application rules, work out a national language learning 
program, and abstain from extremist statements in politics. 
Apart from this, many problems of legislative and bureaucratic 
character need to be resolved, he added. 
  "It is also important that Russia withdrew its military 
units 
from Estonia, because this is a problem over which particularly 
active speculation is going on. It may be that upon the final 
withdrawal other issues for speculation will be found, but 
currently this is the main one," Zonov said in the interview. 
  He said he was going to use the "good team" that his Social 
Democratic Party and the Moderate coalition, part of which the 
Social Democrats are, have in the parliament. He said also his 
own good personal contacts with Estonian politicians were a 
factor that would positively contribute to his work. 
  "I have people whom I know well practically in all factions 
of the parliament," Zonov said, adding that these contacts had 
been established during his work at the Estonian Popular Front 
and the Council of Estonian Citizens. 
  Zonov told BNS that he was ready to work closely with the 
organizations of Estonia's Russian-speakers, but was not going 
to allow himself to become their tool in the parliament or 
enforce ideas that are contradicting his own.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The Estonian Foreign 
Ministry is working on a new wording of a draft agreement on 
social guarantees for the retired Russian military living in the 
country. 
  The text of the agreement is to be taken for discussion at 
the next round of the Estonian-Russian talks due on Apr. 5-6, 
said Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the 
talks. 
  "Virtually this is the same draft that was discussed before. 
We are now working on the provisions that were not agreed upon 
with Russia and we are trying to find a text that would be 
satisfactory for both sides," Tiiman said. 
  Opposition MP [member of parliament] Tiit Made, however, 
warned that Estonia might be backing down on its original 
position and bend to making concessions to Russia over the 
issue. 
  "It is questionable if the new wording of the agreement is 
in 
conformity with the existing laws, because it is possible to 
change the laws any time in the State Assembly at the ruling 
coalition's proposal. Also the text of the agreement can be 
changed so that it would be acceptable for both sides and can be 
interpreted whatever way one sees to be proper," Made said. 
  The opposition MP said it seemed to him as if pressure had 
been exerted upon the Estonian Foreign Ministry lately. 
  "Apparently the Foreign Ministry faces the risk of being 
left 
standing alone, as our great friend Latvia has been pinned to 
the floor," Made said, referring to Latvia and Russia having 
initialed an agreement on the conditions, timetable and 
regulations for the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and 
on the legal status of the Russian troops during the period of 
the withdrawal. 
  "I would very much like to know what Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin spoke during his visit to Helsinki to the 
Finnish leaders and what did Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho 
tell his Estonian colleagues after that," Made told BNS. 
  Tiiman said Estonia was not going to retreat before any of 
Russia's demands. 
  "If the agreement on social guarantees for the retired 
Russian military happens to be signed, MP Tiit Made has the full 
right to protest its text upon its ratification and prove that 
it means Estonia's surrendering to Russia," Tiiman said. 
  Made contested Tiiman's suggestions, saying he would be 
unable to do this because he has not got the parliament majority 
backing him. 
  Made said he as an MP could do whatever he wished, but the 
ruling coalition would still get what it wants by voting down 
any opposition. He said there were signs of danger in the air. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar at today's press conference told 
BNS 
that Made was having a "lively fantasy." The premier assured 
reporters that nobody had exerted pressure on Estonia. 
  "On the contrary: a large number of Western countries have 
expressed support to our demands. At one time we were very 
close to signing a general agreement on troop withdrawal with 
Russia. Now we hope that also Russia has the intention to move 
ahead at the forthcoming round of talks. All that we do stays 
in conformity with the Estonian laws and we are not going to 
change the laws, neither will Estonia back down on its demands," 
Laar said. 
  Made said the issue at stake was giving residence permits to 
4,200-4,500 retired Russian military living in Estonia. 
  Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks with Russia, Vaino 
Reinart, explained that Russia with the social guarantees 
agreement for its retired military wished to establish the 
circle of persons entitled to apply for a residence permit in 
Estonia. Reinart said Estonia, from its side, wanted that the 
agreement instead of determining the circle of persons 
established regulations for how the retired Russian military 
would get their pensions from Russia and pay for the medical 
services. 
  The other key issue is how to privatize the flats of the 
retired Russian military. Russia wants that Estonia issued its 
privatization vouchers to the military for their service in the 
armed forces. 
  "Since Estonia is not giving vouchers even to its own 
citizens for the years of service in the Russian Army, the 
Russian side wants to get a little more rights for the retired 
Russian military than what Estonian citizens are having," 
Reinart told BNS.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- Getting Russia's active 
service military registered is likely to become the main problem 
in drawing up the residents lists of Paldiski, Estonian 
Population Minister Peeter Olesk said. 
  Estonia today began registering the residents of the former 
Soviet military base town located some 40 kilometers to the west 
of the country's capital. The campaign is scheduled to continue 
until Saturday [26 March]. 
  Olesk in an interview with BNS warned that if the country 
fails to get a record of Russia's active service military and 
their family members in the town, a substantial part of Paldiski 
residents will remain a secret for Estonia. 
  "We must have on record how many active service military and 
their family members are there in Paldiski, and who they are. 
If we fail to learn this, it means one: the Russian side is 
destabilizing security in Paldiski," he said. 
  The minister said talks on the issue had taken place between 
the Russian military and the Estonian Government's special 
representative in the area, Juri Tikk. Olesk said Russian army 
representatives had promised to present lists of their military 
in the town. But he added that this was not enough for Estonia. 
  To pass the procedure, Paldiski residents must answer a 
questionnaire, after what they will get a special inscription 
into their passports. Car owners must also present their 
driver's license and car ownership document. 
  The questionnaires will be filled in by Estonian officials 
and then signed by the respondent. 
  Estonian authorities will be entitled to deny working and 
residence permits to non-citizens who have no passport 
inscription on having passed the registration. The stamp will 
also give the holder the right to enter Paldiski at the time 
when special entry regulations are to be introduced. The 
regulations will be effective during the dismantling of two 
nuclear reactors at a Russian base in the area. 
  Olesk said the overwhelming majority of Paldiski residents 
were in favor of the registering. The questionnaires are later 
to be checked by officials at the Citizenship and Migration 
Department. 
  "It is clear that as the passport inscription is also a 
certain kind of guarantee for movement in Paldiski during the 
time of dismantling of the reactors, most Paldiski residents 
want to get this inscription. Paldiski residents also 
understand that the passport inscription and the special 
regulations to be introduced for the time of dismantling of the 
reactors are in their own interests," Olesk explained. 
  Government representative Juri Tikk has earlier said that 
the 
passport registration campaign which started today "is only the 
first stage that will give a picture of the town's residents and 
their documents." 
  "Sooner or later also those who abstain from filling in the 
questionnaire will have to bring their explanations. At the 
time when nuclear fuel will be brought out from Paldiski and 
controls are stepped up at the Pakri peninsula, those people 
will start to get caught," Tikk said. 
  Tikk said about 250 Estonian citizens and some 4,000 loyal 
residents and their children were currently living in Paldiski. 
Those are the people that have received the Estonian 
privatization documents. Estimates put the number of Russian 
military in the town at 800-1,000, about 600 of whom must leave 
the country by Aug. 31, 1994. Then only some 200 Russian 
military specialists will remain in the town to dismantle the 
nuclear facility. 
  "Those people will be allowed to remain in Estonia only in 
their status as civilians," Tikk added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its 
meeting today issued a permission to bring a group of Russian 
military to the former base town of Paldiski for the dismantling 
of the two nuclear training reactors at the Paldiski base. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference after the 
Cabinet meeting said the permit had been issued for "a small 
group of military." 
  Laar said "no problems or obstacles" had emerged over the 
issue of the nuclear reactors' pulldown with Russia. 
  Estonia and Russia have also held talks over the possibility 
to bring into the country additional equipment necessary for the 
dismantling of the reactors. The Estonian leader added that 
also the Nordic countries had promised to extend help in the 
process if necessary. 
  The government's special representative in Paldiski, Juri 
Tikk, told BNS on Friday [18 March] that both Estonia and Russia 
were ready to start taking out nuclear fuel from the reactors. 
The two countries' officials in joint staff and command 
maneuvers on March 16 trained coordination of activity for the 
case of emergencies. Tikk said the countries are ready to act 
effectively also if the worst happened and an explosion 
involving radioactive materials took place. 
  "The Russian side has asked that in case if the `black 
scenario' really starts to happen, which the Russian military in 
Estonia would be unable to manage with, 200 Russian military 
experts together with the necessary equipment be brought into 
Estonia via the Amari airfield. The Estonian side has not 
objected to this plan in principle, but demands that an exact 
list of the military and their equipment be presented before the 
dismantling work begins," Tikk said. 
  Tikk declined to confirm or dismiss the reports that work on 
taking radioactive fuel out from the reactors was going to start 
on Apr. 6. He said the date was still open.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The number of non-ethnic 
Estonians who had obtained Estonian citizenship by the beginning 
of February was 16,324, statistics reports show. 
  Of these more than sixteen thousand people, 3,390 were 
granted citizenship under the regular naturalization procedure, 
and 605, for outstanding merit before the Republic of Estonia. 
  Estonia has established regulations favoring people who 
registered themselves in 1990-1991 as applicants for the 
Estonian citizenship with the Congress of Estonia, a parallel 
parliament set up to stand for the legitimacy of interests and 
legal continuity of the pre-war Republic of Estonia in the 
country's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union. 
  A total 12,329 holders of the Congress of Estonia cards, who 
are not required to pass the language exam or the one-year 
waiting period after entering the citizenship application, had 
obtained citizenship by early last month. 
  Also 12,718 ethnic Estonians who were not citizens by birth 
had been granted citizenship. Ethnic Estonians can obtain 
citizenship under looser procedure rules. 
  Russian-speakers make up about one-third of Estonia's 1.5 
million population. A considerable number of ethnic Russians 
also are citizens by birth and received citizenship without 
having to apply for it. Their exact number is not known.

<F P=106> [Feature comprising "Confidential" memo followed by "Our </F>
Commentary" by Vladimir Zaynetdinov: "Spring. Buds Are 
Swelling, Along With Coup Rumors" -- first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Moscow political and journalistic worlds are in 
turmoil: The specter of another putsch is abroad within the 
Sadovoye beltway. Our correspondent was one of the first to see 
its real ghost (but is it real?). A late-night phone call got 
him out of bed during the night of 17 March. The caller was.... 
In a nutshell, quite an influential and well-informed person 
with quite a good post in a very important state structure. 
Without beating around the bush he immediately asked him to 
turn on the fax machine and take a look at a document. Once our 
correspondent had read it, he was jolted into wakefulness, and 
discussion over the phone was out of the question. In short, 
that same night your KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent found 
himself in the office from which the fax had been sent. We 
fully retain the spelling and punctuation of the document. 
  Confidential 
  Theory 1 
  (according to information as of 16 March 1994) 
  Attention! Upon the emergence of a new theory the 
previous ones are discarded. 
  According to available information, a group of statesmen -- 
First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, General Staff Chief M. 
Kolesnikov, and Moscow Mayor Yu. Luzhkov -- plan to make an 
attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin. V. Shumeyko, M. Poltoranin, 
and B. Mikhaylov (chairman of the Russian Federation State 
Committee on the Press. That is what the document says -- 
Editorial Office) reportedly also belong to the group. There is 
information that the members of the group do not intend to 
involve S. Shakhray; as one of them put it in a private 
conversation, "Shakhray used to be one of our people, but now 
the little creep is no longer on our side." 
  The overall plan of action to remove B. Yeltsin from power 
is 
as follows. Those listed above have already held tentative 
talks with P. Grachev, V. Yerin, and S. Stepashin (defense 
minister, internal affairs minister, and director of the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service respectively -- Editorial Office), 
and by employing various arguments managed to obtain their 
agreement not to take countermeasures. In addition, B. 
Mikhaylov is currently trying to establish contacts with Ye. 
Primakov's (director of the Foreign Intelligence Service -- 
Editorial Office) inner circle. A pretext for launching the 
action should be an address by a prominent public figure or an 
industrialist on the "Ostankino" first television channel 
putting forward the initiative in question and giving as reasons 
the deterioration of the president's health and his physical 
inability to run the country. To substantiate the argument, a 
television documentary should be shown portraying the president 
as a man of poor health and a heavy drinker at that. (According 
to information in the hands of the editorial office, such a 
program has been prepared at a foreign television company's 
studios. The instigator is Yuriy Skokov, chairman of the 
Association of Commodity Producers. It is also known that law 
enforcement organs have a copy of this television program.) 
Then the aforementioned statesmen plan to initiate through 
their allies in the State Duma the constitutional procedure of 
handing provisional presidential powers over to V. Chernomyrdin 
so as to hold emergency presidential elections in the country 
within the next three months. The chiefs and activists of the 
Russian Federation Communist Party State Duma faction are aware 
of the group's plans, and Chernomyrdin's assumption of power 
suits them, but they are displeased with the presence of Yu. 
Luzhkov in the group. 
  According to available reports, the action is scheduled to 
be 
carried out in March, or at the latest April of this year. 
Considered as a preliminary option is the imposition of a state 
of emergency or some elements of it, possibly on limited 
territories, under the pretext of the difficult economic 
situation and the struggle against crime. 
  The first attempt to start the action was made 10 March -- 
on 
that day Yu. Skokov was scheduled to make a television address 
and the documentary was to be shown. V. Chernomyrdin himself 
left on that day for Nizhniy Novgorod and then set out for 
Finland. P. Grachev was in Germany at the time. The attempt 
fell through, however, because A. Yakovlev, chief of the 
"Ostankino" State Television and Radio Company, refused to 
provide television airtime and advised the president's inner 
circle of the intentions. Immediately afterward, a number of 
those who were directly or indirectly involved in the action 
left Moscow: Yu. Skokov for Germany, M. Kolesnikov for France 
(he will return on 16 March). S. Stepashin was hospitalized. 
  According to other information, Yu. Skokov's television 
address and the showing of the documentary did not take place 
because the instigators of the action decided to postpone them 
until a later date, doubting whether preparations for the action 
were complete. A number of the instigators of the action 
believe that they have not yet formulated their own ideology, so 
B. Yeltsin should remain in the post of president for the time 
being. 
  It should be noted that during that same week when the 
unsuccessful attempt to depose Boris Yeltsin was made and also 
during the preceding two or three weeks a whole range of 
politicians, primarily those in opposition to the president, 
made statements about the need for Boris Yeltsin to resign one 
way or another and for early presidential elections to be held. 
One argument in favor of B. Yeltsin's resignation was his 
inability to function in this post in view of his state of 
health. Articles in the press on this subject and analyses of 
possible candidates for the post of president also began to 
appear in the press. 
  Despite the initial failure, the group of aforementioned 
statesmen have not given up their plans to depose Boris Yeltsin 
by using an approximately similar plan of action. Currently, 
talks are under way with R. Vyakhirev, chief of the "Gazprom" 
joint-stock company, to persuade him to deliver an address 
similar to the one Yu. Skokov failed to make. 
  Given that, it is noteworthy that P. Grachev postponed his 
working visit to the Leningrad Military District, which was 
scheduled for 14 March. This was done at the eleventh hour, 
when airplanes with a Defense Ministry delegation and a group of 
journalists had already left. The official explanation is the 
need for reliable control of strategic nuclear forces in the 
absence from Moscow of Supreme Commander in Chief B. Yeltsin and 
Chief of General Staff M. Kolesnikov. During the afternoon of 
14 March a number of staffers of the Defense Ministry press 
service tried to circulate via "tame" journalists the story that 
P. Grachev had stayed on in Moscow to see off B. Yeltsin when he 
left for Sochi and thus to demonstrate yet again his good 
relationship with the president. 
  Some career officers in the Defense Ministry and General 
Staff regard the story regarding control of nuclear forces as 
"another ridiculous claim" since in normal circumstances there 
is no need for the defense minister to have constant personal 
control over these troops. And in an emergency the minister 
would be unable independently to issue orders to the nuclear 
forces without the supreme commander in chief and the chief of 
the General Staff. Moreover, P. Grachev has previously often 
left Moscow during the absence of both B. Yeltsin and M. 
Kolesnikov. 
  In late February a secret directive to limit contacts with 
the press and minimize the number of events involving the 
participation of representatives of the mass media was 
circulated at the Defense Ministry. 
  There is information to the effect that on the whole the 
Armed Forces leadership can be divided into two groups: Boris 
Yeltsin's "loyalists," who have repeatedly expressed their 
commitment to the incumbent president, including P. Grachev and 
his first deputy, G. Kondratyev; and the "opposition" 
represented by General Staff Chief M. Kolesnikov and Deputy 
Defense Minister A. Kokoshin. It is noted that in late 
February-early March a member of the top brass, asked whether M. 
Kolesnikov might resign, stated in an unofficial conversation 
that "maybe you can speak with a greater degree of probability 
about the imminent resignation of P. Grachev, and it is still 
not clear which of the two (P. Grachev and M. Kolesnikov) feels 
more confident." 
  According to available information, Deputy Defense Minister 
A. Kokoshin maintains close ties with O. Soskovets; he regularly 
does various services to him, his deputies, and relatives. A. 
Kokoshin and O. Soskovets meet virtually twice or three times a 
week. 
  On 15 March, from 1700 to 1800, P. Grachev met with V. 
Chernomyrdin. The subject of the meeting has not been 
disclosed. The very fact of its taking place has not been 
publicized. 
  However, on 16 March P. Grachev held a press conference at 
which he categorically denied rumors about the possibility of 
the military coming to power. P. Grachev stressed that, so long 
as he is defense minister, "there will be no military 
dictatorship. The Army is outside politics. The Army will 
intervene in events in the country only when it sees the start 
of civil war. The Army will not tolerate civil war." 
<H5>  Our Commentary </H5>
  Let us think back to 16 August 1991. A similar document 
comes into the hands of the editorial office. In prospect there 
is the signing of the Union Treaty and stability that has more 
or less emerged in relations between the center and the 
republics. In the past is the serious -- but not taken 
seriously enough -- warning by then Foreign Minister 
Shevardnadze about an impending coup and subsequent 
dictatorship. Then came the SCSE [State Committee for the State 
of Emergency]. 
  But let us return to this strange but serious document. 
Although why is it strange? 
  Theory 1. Events since the release of the Lefortovo 
prisoners give grounds for believing that stormclouds are indeed 
gathering over the president. "Friends betray you," Napoleon 
said. In politics real friends are extremely rare. Yeltsin had 
only to start planning to go to Sochi on vacation for the 
long-standing rumors about the president's poor health to begin 
gathering strength. Let us note that the emphasis has 
increasingly been placed on "this matter"; Ostensibly Yeltsin is 
not only quite a drinker, but cannot properly run the country. 
So he has gone to Sochi for further rehabilitation. 
  Meanwhile in Moscow there is a marked increase in activity 
and a large-scale militia operation is being held under the code 
name "Elbrus" to combat crime, primarily organized crime. 
  And on Tuesday, 15 March, as though by arrangement, at a 
press conference Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin 
resolutely declares a ruthless war on crime involving all 
available forces. Internal troop units wearing militia uniform 
are immediately additionally moved into Moscow, and cadets at 
Ministry of Internal Affairs educational establishments in the 
capital also take part in "Elbrus." But even "Elbrus" is not 
sufficient pretext for concentrating forces in the capital. 
However, the upcoming 17 March opposition rally devoted to the 
third anniversary of the all-union referendum on the unity of 
the Union provides weightier grounds for "considering" the 
security of Muscovites, especially as the Working Russia members 
and their supporters were meeting on Teatralnaya Square, not far 
from the Kremlin, to sing the praises of the late "united and 
indivisible" state. In general, there were all too many militia 
in the city that week. 
  Echoing Mr. Yerin, boss of the entire Russian militia, 
Federation Council Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko (once again 
probably a coincidence) suddenly began to speak about a state of 
emergency in view of the grave economic situation. Admittedly, 
he later made the proviso that he was referring merely to a 
state of emergency in the economy and finance. 
  Also probably by accident, the question of an economic state 
of emergency was discussed during the evening of 14 March at a 
meeting of the two parliamentary speakers Vladimir Shumeyko and 
Ivan Rybkin and Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. The State Duma 
chairman told INTERFAX of this. However, the premier expressed 
his attitude toward the question of a state of emergency only 
Friday 18 March. He was against a state of emergency. Probably 
by then the crisis in the economy was over. The rally on 
Teatralnaya Square also passed off without excesses. Moreover, 
the document under discussion, so it transpired, was already 
passing through the hands of extremely influential and respected 
personalities. 
  Constitutional Court Chairman Valeriy Zorkin, the chairmen 
of 
both television companies -- Oleg Poptsov (Russian TV) and 
Aleksandr Yakovlev ("Ostankino") -- Sergey Filatov, leader of 
the President's Administration, Federal Counterintelligence 
Service Director Sergey Stepashin, and a number of other 
respected people had familiarized themselves with its contents. 
  Clearly sensing that something was wrong, LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who 
once again was left on the sidelines, dropped a bombshell at a 
meeting with bankers which also "happened" to coincide with the 
statements by Yerin and Shumeyko, saying that a repetition of 21 
September last year was possible any day now. "All the signs 
are there, the symptoms are present, the papers and documents 
are ready, and the troops have long since been moved in for 
street fighting." 
  The behavior of Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who 
cancelled 
his visit to the troops of the Leningrad Military District at 
the last moment, 14 March, is also perfectly explicable against 
the background of these events. Obviously Grachev had to be in 
Moscow at all costs at this time. His well known opponent in 
the Army Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov was returning 
to the capital 16 March. And, I repeat, an opposition rally was 
scheduled for 17 March. We think the story of Pavel Grachev's 
actions is as follows. 
  After the abortive attempt, if the document is to be 
believed, to oust Yeltsin the defense minister decided not 
merely "not to oppose" the aforementioned "group of state 
figures" but also to make his own contribution to the course of 
events. Neither the president (if the "conspirators" failed) 
nor the "conspirators" (if they were victorious) would forgive 
him further fence-sitting like that of October last year. 
Probably the remark in the document by a member of the top 
brass forecasting the resignation of Grachev or Kolesnikov has a 
real foundation. "The Army will intervene in events in the 
country only when it sees the start of civil war," the military 
minister hurriedly declared at the press conference hastily 
convened 16 March. And, let us note, it is also possible to 
initiate a civil war. For instance, to instigate mass riots 
which, who knows, could begin at that very rally. And, judging 
by the mayor's statement, real preparations had been and were 
being made for them. 
  It is no accident that the main communist leaders were not 
seen at the rally. We have managed to establish from circles 
close to one of the special services that steps were taken to 
ensure that they themselves would not want to take part. The 
scenario for the state of emergency could have been more or less 
as follows. The crowd is whipped into a frenzy (the opposition 
leaders have seemingly become very expert at this) and then at a 
suitable moment there is an explosion in the midst of the crowd 
-- then a fight and total mayhem. The OMON [Special-Purpose 
Militia Detachments] and internal troops positioned nearby move 
in. Mass riots are guaranteed. Then a state of emergency is 
declared in Moscow. Meanwhile the president is on vacation in 
Sochi. He is seriously ill and incapable of leading the 
country. Under the Constitution power passes to the premier. 
Nobody knows what the outcome would be of the presidential 
elections that must follow within three months. They may not 
take place at all. But for the moment that is all conjecture. 
What are the facts? 
  The reasons prompting the president's erstwhile supporters 
to 
seek methods of removing him from power are as follows, I think. 
  The military-industrial lobby, headed by First Vice Premier 
Oleg Soskovets and First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin, has long quite openly expressed its dissatisfaction 
with the president. Yeltsin takes no particular notice of them 
and is squeezing funding for the military-industrial complex. 
  Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin is facing the clear 
threat of being left without the MVD [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs] as a result of its radical reorganization, which may 
signal the end for this monster. In the very near future, so we 
are told by sources within the president's apparatus and the 
State-Legal Administration, the MVD will lose the department's 
most powerful structure -- the internal troops. It is planned 
to use them as the basis for setting up a National Guard. On 
top of this, so we learned from the same sources, in the spirit 
of the fight against corruption the Moscow Main Internal Affairs 
Administration may be placed directly under the command of the 
president. 
  Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov, in the event of 
the possible removal of Yeltsin from the presidency, would be 
the first and probably only contender for the post of military 
minister. 
  Theory 2. The president deliberately instigated the 
appearance of this "confidential" document in order to 
strengthen his grip on his team, which is getting out of 
control, and remove from the game troublesome individuals whom 
he dislikes. 
  But in both cases the reasons for the disagreements between 
Yeltsin and the "conspirators" remain as before: They no longer 
suit each other. Somebody has got to go. But who? 
  Theory 3. It is a blatant forgery. But who is responsible? 
  P.S. Painless prevention of a coup d'etat is possible only 
when notice is given of it before it begins. It is better to be 
wrong ahead of time than to reflect on the reasons behind a 
conspiracy as you count the number of victims after the event.

  [Text] A leading member of the Party of Russian Unity and 
Concord in the State Duma Sergey Stankevich has described as a 
falsification the document reported in the media describing 
alleged plans of a coup. Boris Yeltsin would reportedly be 
removed from power as a result of the overthrow and his place 
would be taken by the current prime-minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  In a Tuesday interview with INTERFAX Stankevich said that 
the 
publications reflect "the intentions of some political forces to 
change the predominant political atmosphere because at the 
moment the focus of public attention has shifted to the question 
of national accord." 
  In his opinion this new backdrop does not find favor with 
forces that can survive only in conditions of acute 
confrontation and that want to "push the president to some 
extraordinary steps." 
  The purpose of such reports is "to damage certain 
politicians 
and provoke a clash with the president." According to 
Stankevich, the blow is primarily directed against Chernomyrdin 
"as the strongest political figure next to the president." 
Stankevich believes that a blow was also delivered against the 
Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who has announced his intention to 
run for presidency in 1996. 
  At a Tuesday meeting with the press the chairman of the Duma 
committee for economic policy Sergey Glazyev (Democrat) 
described Version No.1 of a coup in Russia reported by the media 
as a crude provocation aimed at plunging the country into chaos. 
  According to him, "the rumors are being spread by the same 
people who are now trying to discredit the movement Accord for 
Russia." Together with representatives of several Communist and 
nationalist parties and movements he signed a statement on the 
formation of the movement last week. 
  In his opinion, the idea of the new movement is civic peace 
and harmony, the unification of all constructive forces, 
including the opposition. "Everything that separates people in 
different parties is insignificant compared to the current 
danger to our country," Glazyev stressed.

  [Text] Former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoy has 
described as false allegations of a brewing coup following the 
publication of an anonymous newspaper report outlining such a 
scenario. He said the situation was being dramatized to divert 
public attention. 
  Rutskoy spoke of the Soviet Communist Party being used as 
bogey three years ago and the Soviets in the second half of 
1992. Searches are now under way for someone to take the blame 
after the bombing of the previous parliament, he said adding 
that no one had ever plotted a coup because one had already been 
pulled off. 
  Rutskoy, who shaved off a beard he had grown while in prison 
on charges of organizing last October's rioting in Moscow, was 
speaking to reporters while attending an agricultural fair in 
Moscow. 
  Although he described the current situation as 
unpredictable, 
Rutskoy said he did not want any repeat of what happened last 
October. "I had enough time for a rethink and to come to some 
conclusions", he said. 
  Rutskoy believes the situation can still be redressed if the 
control of reforms is regained, priorities and incentives are 
set and laws strictly observed. "That must be the basis of 
today's policies", he said. Although he agreed that "any 
solution to vital problems depends on internal stability", 
Rutskoy said it was important to know who exactly would be party 
to a proposed civil peace pact. "Should there be any compromise 
with those who plundered and ruined the country and bombed the 
parliament? If so, what sort of compromise and for which 
purpose?", he asked. 
  Asked which of the three he considered himself to be - 
president vice president or former vice president, Rutskoy said 
he had always believed himself to be citizen first. "If the coup 
was lawful, then I am former vice president. If it was unlawful 
which it was because of being unconstitutional, then I am vice 
president", he said. 
  Rutskoy described Acting Prosecutor General Alexey 
Ilyushenko 
as "a swindler who forged documents and filed a false report" 
about his involvement in financial irregularities. He said 
Ilyushenko must be put behind bars. 
  On his own political future, Rutskoy said it was early days 
yet to speak about it. Asked if he would run for presidency, he 
said "let us wait until presidential elections if there are 
any". And he added "after all, there must be someone to 
nominate my candidacy".

  [Excerpt] Today's appearance by Aleksandr Rutskoy at the 
All-Russian Exhibition Center partly satisfied the old interest 
of journalists in the person of the ex-vice president. He 
commented on the rumors of a coup in preparation in his own way: 
  [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] The Supreme Soviet got in the 
way 
so they destroyed it, they shot up the parliament. Now 
something else has to get in the way. But who? What? You have 
to distract people's attention. Nobody was ever even dreaming 
of any coups. The coup has already happened, the coup d'etat has 
already happened in this state. So what coups are there to talk 
about? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The idea of civic accord is not 
an undisputed one for Aleksandr Vladimirovich. 
  [Rutskoy] Agree with who? With those who plundered the state 
and destroyed it? With those who shot up the parliament? You 
want me to agree with them? [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 1900 GMT on 22 
March carries the following voice recording of Rutskoy at the 
Russian Exhibition, answering reporters' questions: "Industrial 
instability, rocking the boat, playing games, agreements, 
money-centrism -- all of this will end badly. One cannot play 
games with laws. Laws exist to be fulfilled. When we learn to 
obey the laws we shall live well. Otherwise there is no 
democracy, there is anarchy."]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1645 GMT on 22 March carries the 
"Filatov Explains" program consisting of a 10-minute recorded 
interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the president's 
administration, with an unnamed interviewer. Filatov says that 
81 decrees and instructions have been signed by the president 
over the past week. He elaborates on three of these -- the 
decree of 17 March on an increase in compensation payments for 
caregivers, the draft law on additions to the law on pensions, 
and the decree on citizenship status. 
  The interviewer then asks the "question of the week" on 
media 
reports of a "coup d'etat" during the president's vacation and 
speculation on his health. Filatov says he doesn't regard these 
matters separately but sees them as links in a chain. It all 
began with the amnesty and the build-up of an opposition to the 
president and his policies. "This became particularly manifest 
this week by a whole number of factors after the president first 
presented his message on strengthening the state, and especially 
after the president came out with his major initiative -- one 
that we have been waiting for a long time -- the creation of 
civic accord, on the basis of which we would be able to embark 
clearly on normal economic reforms. Against the background of 
all this it was clearly necessary for some people to show their 
particular stand, their particular position, and I don't believe 
that this happened by chance." 
  Asked about Yeltsin's health, Filatov replies: "Quite 
normal. I have already said that I think that these stores are 
not by chance. Reports have been coming in that the president 
has been up in a helicopter, and one could have shown him 
playing tennis, but, unfortunately, the weather stepped in and 
prevented it." 
  Regarding the scenario of an alleged plot, Filatov says that 
some kind of new structure of a coalition, also calling for 
accord, is apparently being created, but there cannot be two 
"accords" in society. "If you look at it, then I think all of 
this has been organized by one center, one group -- an 
opposition group of course -- and one can see a certain attempt 
to create an unpleasant atmosphere of fear and mistrust, and I 
think one cannot love one's people very much to bring them to 
such a situation." 
  The interviewer asks Filatov if media talk about possible 
early elections is all part of the same chain. Filatov replies 
that some sociologists are saying that this would be the best 
time for Rutskoy to become president. Filatov does not think 
that Rutskoy is ready to become head of state.

  [Text] The sensation of the day was an Interfax report from 
the public relations center of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service [FSK]. It turns out the FSK had information about the 
fact that a so-called version of a coup under preparation in 
Russia would be published in a range of newspapers. 
Incidentally, the fullest version of the version was published 
today in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA. Further, the FSK told the Russian 
leadership about it in advance. The FSK, together with the 
Interior Ministry and the Procuracy-General, are looking for 
those who set up this provocation.

<F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Yet Again No Coup d'Etat Took </F>
Place in Russia"] 
  [Text] The beginning of this week was marked by panic 
which arose in Moscow political circles because of a largely 
ordinary event: announcements about the prime minister's trip to 
Sochi. With unusual speed, and not without help from certain 
news agencies, rumors that the president's state of health had 
deteriorated and that V. Chernomyrdin probably went to the Black 
Sea coast to seize power in the country started to circulate in 
the capital. 
  Although a little later the president's administration and 
the government apparatus put out explanations to the effect that 
everything is in order as regards the president's health, while 
the need for Chernomyrdin's trip to Sochi was prompted by the 
fact that the president has to sign an amended draft federal 
budget to enable the State Duma to begin its discussion as soon 
as possible, Monday morning passed off fairly nervously in many 
of the capital's political lobbies and corridors of power. 
  Meanwhile, rumors of an imminent coup d'etat again started 
to 
circulate in political circles last week. Matters have reached 
a point whereby a coup scenario has been actively circulated in 
the State Duma and published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Thus, there 
is every reason to believe that last week's main event was that 
no coup took place in our country. 
  Of course, the appearance of the latest putsch scenario 
should be regarded as nothing but a common political 
provocation, most likely undertaken with the aim of causing a 
split in the executive branch's ranks. But we cannot fail to 
notice a certain ordinariness in the situation. In several 
recent years, starting in approximately 1988, the country has 
regularly been rocked every few months by rumors of imminent 
coups and putsches. Whereas there have been only two real 
putsches -- in August 1991 and October 1993. Therefore we 
cannot fail to ask ourselves: Why does the putsch problem arise 
so persistently over and over again? Moreover, it arises in 
Moscow at the highest echelons of federal power, at the same 
time as the rest of Russia quietly lives its own life. 
  Recent observations of the dynamics of the development of 
relations in the federal power system allow the detection of an 
obvious regularity: Fuss and nervousness always begin at the 
moment when the president is either absent or not engaged in 
energetic political activity. The reason for this regularity is 
no mystery: The Russian state structure's stability does not 
rely on democratic institutions or on a balance between the 
branches. The current regime's weakness lies in the fact that 
it has gotten stuck halfway between totalitarianism and 
democracy (or the other way round). Under this regime the state 
of all democratic institutions depends on the actions (or 
inaction) and the state of health of one person -- the 
president. When applied to Third World countries an analogous 
situation a customarily called a personal power regime. 
  We are witnessing a paradox: A strong executive branch 
ensures stability in the state given an opposition parliament, 
which cannot upset this stability. But at the same time the 
executive branch itself, namely the federal executive branch, is 
starting to discover signs of its own unstable state. 
  It is no longer a secret to anyone that the president, 
especially in recent months, has been "in the shadows" much more 
often than is warranted by the situation existing in the 
country. Discussion of the reasons for this remains a taboo 
topic for the public and mass media. Such discussions have been 
declared unpatriotic. Whereas extremely vigorous debates about 
this are being conducted in various corridors of federal power. 
The president has only to provide just a little extra fuel for 
these conversations (by going on leave, for example) for a fuss 
to start in political lobbies and corridors of power and the 
level of nervousness to reach the highest reading. 
  We have had an opportunity to observe all this during the 
last week. Deputy V. Isakov's apparently quite unexpected 
statement about the possibility of electing the president by a 
kind of Assembly of the Land was immediately followed by a 
statement from the opposite flank. M. Poltoranin proposed that 
presidential and parliamentary elections be postponed until 
1998. Almost simultaneously, as if on command, two movements -- 
"The Realists" and "Accord for Russia's Sake" -- were 
established in Moscow. In actual fact they are preelection 
blocs. A noteworthy detail is that the blocs' policy statements 
say nothing about participation in the election campaign now 
under way for local organs of power, although much is said about 
presidential and parliamentary elections. It is logical to ask 
why. Because elections to federal organs of power are not due 
to take place for another two years. At last the latest putsch 
scenario has appeared. 
  The evolving situation is surprisingly similar to that which 
arose in Russia at the beginning of last summer. Then, let us 
recall, all political forces threw themselves into preparing for 
early parliamentary elections. This was at a time when both the 
Supreme Soviet and the Congress, which were naturally against 
these elections, were functioning. A constitution preventing 
the holding of them was in force. In short, at that time early 
parliamentary elections objectively seemed an unrealistic 
possibility. BUT THEY TOOK PLACE! True, the route toward them 
lay through the bloody events of September-October. It is hard 
to say how exactly the development of the current situation will 
repeat last year's situation. There are many similarities. But 
besides this there is one really striking fact: The president's 
edict on early presidential elections on 12 June 1994 is in 
force. It is all the more surprising that the president 
rescinded dozens of laws and edicts after the new constitution 
was adopted. But not this edict. 
  It can be assumed that the ruling nomenklatura and leading 
politicians are perfectly well aware of this. Their behavior 
gives strong grounds for concluding that their actions are based 
on the realistic possibility of an early presidential election. 
It cannot be ruled out here that they are banking on the fact 
that this election will take place in the not too distant 
future. Although nobody is saying this openly. 
  The actual prospect of an early presidential election makes 
the ruling nomeklatura extremely nervous and compels it to 
commit acts which are not always well thought-out. Acts, for 
instance, like the statements on the possibility of canceling or 
postponing the general presidential election. Here, voluntarily 
or involuntarily, Poltoranin and Isakov presented a united front 
in support of the ruling nomenklatura, which is extremely 
alarmed by the possibility of a politician like V. Zhirinovskiy 
winning the election, because this would inevitably bring in its 
wake the replacement of the nomenklatura bosses. For his part 
Zhirinovskiy -- like, incidentally, other political leaders -- 
is strengthening his party ranks with increasing vigor. The 
appearance of the putsch scenario does not look accidental 
either. The possibility of an attempt to solve the problem by 
means of force should apparently not be discounted. 
  However, while a president who has demonstrated, contrary to 
all rumors, that he is healthy, energetic, and completely 
capable is in power, we should most probably not fear such a 
scenario of the development of events. There are two mutually 
complementary methods of avoiding the distinct possibility of a 
serious political crisis. Above all the president should 
obviously make maximum effective use of the assets he has 
available thanks to the new constitution, primarily a strong 
executive branch, in order to stabilize the situation in the 
economy. At the same time, although it is an extremely 
difficult task, the state's democratic structure must be 
strengthened. Within the framework in which the existing 
constitution allows this to be done. Specifically, a Law on the 
Constitutional Court must be adopted as soon as possible and all 
participants in the political game forced to fulfill all 
constitutional provisions unconditionally and strictly. Strong 
presidential power is without any doubt capable of stabilizing 
the economy. But a strong state, which everybody is talking 
about at the moment, which does not have support in a developed 
civic society will always be threatened by palace coups. 
Therefore, once stability in the economy has been achieved 
there must be further constitutional improvements in the area of 
the democratic state structure and in the direction of 
strengthening the representative branch and achieving a balance 
between the branches, which will indicate the strengthening of 
ties between the state and civic society. But in conditions of 
economic instability (and three months' experience of the State 
Duma's activity proves this convincingly) a weakening of the 
executive branch in favor of the representative branch will most 
likely lead to anarchy and then to seizure of power. 
  By taking these steps the president could lead the country 
to the next presidential election and lay the foundation for a 
new Russian democratic tradition: the legitimate primacy of 
state power. 
  Otherwise, if the trend of preserving the situation (and 
consequently preserving the democratic transformations and 
economic reforms) is maintained, there will be a permanent 
threat that the country will roll backwards. Just like the 
threat that a most acute political crisis will arise. For 
example, in the event that the election is won by a candidate 
unacceptable to the highest political and state nomenklatura, 
events could develop on the pattern of those which took place in 
Algeria two years ago. When Islamic fundamentalists won the 
parliamentary elections and the ruling regime annulled the 
election results and declared a state of emergency in the 
country. The state of emergency in Algeria is still in force.

<F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "`Realists' Want To Pool Efforts </F>
To Resolve the Country's Problems. They Have Set Up Their Own 
Club for This"] 
  [Text] "Transformations meeting the interests of society 
are possible only with nationwide accord based on a clear 
understanding of the aims, with a quest for ways to achieve 
them, and, most importantly, with the determination of the price 
which the country and its people will agree to pay for reforms, 
without running the risk of facing a national catastrophe," the 
"Statement on the Creation and Aims of the `Realists' Club" 
states. The club was established in Moscow on 14 March. The 
board of the new organization includes Aleksandr Vladislavlev, 
first vice president of the RUIE [Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]; Valeriy Neverov, president of 
the "Germes" Concern; State Duma Deputy Yekaterina Lakhova; 
Yuriy Petrov, chairman of the State Investment Corporation; 
Nikolay Fedorov, president of the Chuvash Republic; Mikhail 
Shmakov, chairman of the FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade 
Unions of Russia]; and a number of other well-known politicians, 
regional leaders, entrepreneurs, and arts figures who adhere to 
the concept of political realism. Supporting the quest for a 
mechanism to formulate accord "for the sake of supreme national 
interests," they proposed convening a Russian congress "For 
Civil Accord in the Name of Russia's Revival" to adopt the 
appropriate document. The main aim of the "Realists" Club has 
been proclaimed as pooling efforts to resolve the problems 
facing the country and promoting mutual understanding and 
cooperation between political and public forces. 
  The creation of the "Realists" Political Club may be 
regarded 
as one more response from society's political elite to the 
president's initiative with regard to signing the Memorandum on 
Civil Peace. In a broader context this event may also be defined 
as a regrouping of society's "summit" forces in the search for a 
response to the political, social, and spiritual-moral realities 
of life today. Time will show what kind of response these 
initiatives will elicit -- not only in the political 
establishment but also in broad sections of the population.

"Sincerity of Intentions Must Be Judged by Actions"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federation President's Administration 
is keeping a close watch on reactions to Boris Yeltsin's call 
for civil peace and accord in the state and in society. 
  As is known, on 10 March the president met in the Kremlin 
with representatives of Russian state, public, and business 
circles, and the meeting participants said they agreed to the 
idea of preparing and signing an Agreement on Civil Peace in 
Russia. They invited political leaders, public figures, and 
citizens of Russia wanting to contribute to the preparation of 
the Agreement on Civil Peace to join in the work. 
  On 18 March, a number of newspapers published an appeal by a 
group of figures announcing the creation of an association that 
would be called "Accord for Russia." The appeal was signed by 
several people who are known for their implacable stance 
vis-a-vis the president and his policy of late. They include 
several leaders of communist and "national patriotic" 
organizations, as well as a Constitutional Court judge, whose 
functions basically preclude participation in political 
organizations. 
  The President's Administration expects the new association 
to 
make a specific contribution to the preparation of the Agreement 
on Civil Peace in Russia and then to its practical 
implementation. It is by these actions that society will judge 
the sincerity of the intentions of the appeal's authors. This 
was announced by the Russian Federation president's press 
service.

  [Text] An international scientific and practical conference 
devoted to the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the 
development of virgin and fallow lands is taking place in 
Barnaul today. In his message to its participants and all 
virgin land developers, Boris Yeltsin emphasized in particular 
that the experience of the development of the virgin lands was a 
convincing testimony of the fact that if efforts are united, 
success is guaranteed in even the most difficult of 
undertakings. This experience, Yeltsin thinks, is especially 
valuable at present. It is only by acting together and closely 
interacting and cooperating in all spheres that the crisis can 
be surmounted faster and the difficult problems of the 
Commonwealth countries resolved, notes the president.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Alexey Filatov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- "In the conditions of mass 
food intervention, the government was forced to issue an order 
raising customs duties on certain categories of imported 
foodstuffs in order to protect (domestic) agricultural 
producers", Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha 
told a news conference on Tuesday. 
  The vice-premier cited numerous facts proving to great 
difficulties with the sale of Russian-made products in the 
country's major industrial centres. Thus, about 70 per cent of 
dairy and meat products come to the Moscow and St. Petersburg 
markets from abroad, while domestic commodity producers are 
actually barred from these markets. According to Zaveryukha, 
the reason lying behind this is that certain structures find it 
more profitable to do business with foreign suppliers than 
Russian ones. 
  The deputy prime minister promised that "this move will not 
entail a jump in retail prices for foodstuffs. The new rates of 
import duties are to reduce profits of importing organizations 
rather than send prices up", he emphasised. 
  Zaveryukha told reporters that "certain circles objected to 
this order, they were openly lobbying against it and continue 
lobbying for its cancellation". But the government, 
specifically Zaveryukha himself, stand up for support of 
agricultural producers in all spheres, including in the 
financial one. 
  "I have been instructed to investigate into the causes of 
over- 20-day delay in credits extended by the government to 
assist rural areas with the spring sowing campaign", the deputy 
prime minister reported. He believes such a delay amounts to 
disruption of the sowing campaign and "will result in the loss 
of 7-8 million tons of grain this year". 
  And yet, even with this situation taken into account, Russia 
will have enough basic foodstuffs this year, largely made by 
domestic producers, Zaveryukha said.

<F P=106> [Yuriy Rytov report: "Poverty Is No Longer the Same. In </F>
January, 52.6 Million People Were Below the Poverty Line, in 
February 24.8 Million"] 
  [Text] There is hardly any need to demonstrate that, of 
all the negative consequences of the reform, the most painful is 
the truly calamitous situation in which millions of our indigent 
fellow citizens find themselves. The sentimental pictures which 
have flashed on our television screens -- charity dinners and 
charity gifts, clearly pursuing publicity purposes -- have been 
quite unable to rectify the situation, merely underlining the 
depth of the people's sorrow. 
  In January, 35.4 percent of the population had an income 
below the living wage. Let us call things by their proper 
names: More than one-third of our fellow citizens were doomed 
to a slow extinction. 
  But then the situation changed materially in February, when 
16.7 percent of citizens remained below the poverty line. The 
little word "only" is clearly inappropriate here. It is equally 
inappropriate to be moved by the changes that have occurred. 
Because 24.8 million hapless citizens represent, all the same, a 
very large number, monstrously large! Therefore the words used 
to form the headline must be perceived with a certain degree of 
irony. 
  And yet the cited facts require careful analysis. They 
attest that Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet has replaced the 
"declaration of intentions" with practical steps aimed at giving 
social protection to needy sections of the population. It is 
very important to investigate the mechanism of such actions. 
  What, then, happened? 
  First, the difference in the wages that were increased as of 
1 December last year and as of 1 January this year for working 
people in the budget-funded sphere and in management organs was 
paid in February. The payment was increased by the amount of 
the compensation relating to pensions. 
  Second, the rate of inflation slowed down sharply in 
February 
and stood at 9.9 percent. The increase in wages (10 percent) 
overtook inflation probably for the first time. 
  Third, owing to the low rate of inflation, there was an 
insignificant change in the actual size of the living wage: 
51,360 rubles [R] in January, R56,574 in February. 
  A natural question arises: How stable is the trend which has 
become apparent? First of all, it should be said that provision 
has already been made for a number of protective measures in the 
social sphere. Thus, as of 1 February it is proposed to increase 
compensation for pensioners from R11,700 to R20,000, and to 
R29,600 as of 1 May. 
  But this, of course, is not the main point. Everything 
depends on the limit to which the level of inflation can be 
kept. This is primarily dependent on the republic budget 
deficit, which is to be compensated for to a considerable degree 
by money emission. The government intends to keep the budget 
deficit within quite a rigid framework -- approximately 9 
percent of GDP. This would also ensure a moderate rate of 
inflation. 
  The final fate of the budget is not yet known, however. At 
the end of last week Viktor Chernomyrdin signed its draft and 
sent the document to the president and the State Duma. It can 
only be hoped that its classes of expenditure will not swell up 
under pressure from various lobbyist groupings. 
  In any case it is gratifying that the cabinet's social 
policy 
has occupied priority positions not in words but in actual fact.

  [Excerpts] The Russian Federation Government's Center for

state statistical organs, inflation was 1.8 percent over the 
past week. 
  Foodstuffs became 1.7 percent more expensive, nonfood goods 
rose by 3.1 percent, and paid services to the population rose by 
3.5 percent. The greatest increase in consumer prices was 
registered in the East Siberian and Urals economic regions. 
Inflation was lowest in the Volga-Vyatka region at 1.5 percent. 
In Moscow prices rose by 1.9 percent while in St. Petersburg 
they rose 2.6 percent. [passage omitted] 
  The average cost of a range of 19 essential foodstuffs on 15 
March was 43,000 rubles [R] calculated per month. This 
represents a rise of 1.8 percent over the week, 4.2 percent 
since the beginning of the month, and 40 percent since the 
beginning of the year. In organized trade prices, this range of 
products cost R31,400 whereas in nonorganized trade it cost 
R55,900. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ivan Zhagel report: "It Seems That There Will Be No Rent </F>
Rebate for Savings Bank Investors"] 
  [Text] The threefold compensation for Savings Bank 
accounts held on 1 January 1992, which is being carried out in 
accordance with the Russian president's edict, is being viewed 
by many people as a token gesture which will not cover the 
losses due to inflation. However, the document envisaged other 
benefits for investors. 
  In particular the edict contains recommendations to local 
executive organs "to grant to individuals in receipt of one-off 
compensation payments the right to use those funds to pay for 
municipal and housing services at the tariffs (rates) in force 
at 1 November 1993 on condition that they transfer the entire 
amount of compensation into a separate interest-free deposit 
account during January 1994." Bearing in mind the rapid rise in 
prices for housing and municipal services, of course, this 
measure could considerably stifle the discontent at the token 
compensation. But this measure is not being fulfilled yet in 
any of the Russian regions. 
  The point, of course, is not that, according to the edict, 
money should have been paid into the special deposit account 
back in January. The beginning of the compensation was delayed 
so the deadline for the transfer of the funds could have been 
postponed, too. So there are no problems there. Incidentally, 
the letter of instruction on how the payment for municipal and 
housing services from the special account is to be made in 
practice was not sent out by the leadership of the Savings Bank 
to its branches until March. 
  A far more serious problem, however, is the fact that the 
provision of the edict on the payment for services at a reduced 
rate is recommendatory in character. The final word here rests 
with the local authorities. And they are in no hurry to adopt 
the appropriate decision. 
  Nor has such a decision been made in Moscow. Furthermore, a 
senior official from the Moscow government has stated that it is 
hardly likely to be adopted at all. The payment of municipal 
and housing services at reduced rates will hit the capital's 
budget. 
  I think that in this instance what we are seeing is a 
classic 
example of administrative sleight of hand in which nothing is 
decided but the semblance of the solution of a problem is 
created. 
  The question, then, is whether the local authorities have 
the 
money to introduce extra concessions or not. The answer is no. 
In that case why should the local authorities be held 
accountable for the fact that the holdings of Savings Bank 
investors have lost value?

come. This is enshrined in the new military doctrine. The 
provisions of this doctrine will be the basis of the reform 
strategy during the third stage (post-1995), during which the 
Russian Armed Forces will undergo in-depth transformations to 
determine what they will be like in the 21st century. The Armed 
Forces will be a relatively small, but powerful and mobile army, 
materially secure, equipped with the most effective arms and 
military hardware systems, capable of protecting Russia against 
outside encroachments and being a guarantor of peace and 
stability in the country. That is the first point. 
  Second, they will be the army of a democratic state, having 
fundamentally different relations with society and state and 
command respect and prestige among the people. 
  Third, they will be an important tool of national policy, 
preserving all the best traditions of their predecessors, 
everything relating to the performance of exclusively defensive 
tasks. 
  These three positions effectively reflect the main purpose 
of 
the process of reform of the Russian Armed Forces currently 
under way. 
  [Poroskov] As you know, the reforms being implemented are 
checked out during strategic drills and regional command-staff 
exercises of which there were a plethora last year. A series of 
experiments is also being carried out. The trial switch -- 
using the Moscow Military District as a basis -- to the 
territorial principle of rear services support is one of these. 
What is the essence of this experiment? 
  [Kondratyev] We are seeking ways of improving the whole 
system of rear services support, and the effectiveness of the 
work of rear services structures is being practically verified 
amid the transition to market relations. To this end early last 
year rear services support staff centers were set up for the 
troops regardless of the branch of the Armed Forces to which 
they are affiliated. Over the past year they have proved their 
viability and effectiveness. Centers of this kind will probably 
also be set up in the Kaliningrad special area and in the Far 
East Military District. And this year the Moscow Military 
District has decided to fully switch to the territorial system 
of support. 
  [Poroskov] Now a word about another experiment -- the 
Leningrad, North Caucasus, and Transbaykal Military Districts 
are switching to the zonal-territorial principle of organizing 
air defense, assigning responsibility for it to the commanders 
of the military districts' troops. Is that not turning back the 
clock, a return to the so-called "Ogarkov" principle that was 
later rejected? 
  [Kondratyev] Air defense formations were indeed disbanded in 
the period 1977-1980 at the suggestion of N.V. Ogarkov, then 
chief of the General Staff, and their forces and facilities 
transferred to the jurisdiction of military district commanders. 
This organization's main shortcoming was its lack of unified 
responsibility for the air defense of the country and of the 
Armed Forces. Unity both as regards the organization and the 
combat use of air defense forces and facilities was violated. 
And in 1986 we switched to the current system. 
  In the course of military reform it is planned to make air 
defense an integral part of Russia's unified aerospace defense 
system [ADS]. The air defense organization is based on the 
territorial principle -- not cooperation between associations of 
air defense troops and the air defense troops and forces of 
military districts, the Air Force, and Navy as happened before, 
but unified command and control of these forces in air defense 
zones and regions. In accordance with a unified concept and 
plan. The plan is to have a large mobile reserve of air defense 
forces in central regions of the country -- in order to promptly 
step up efforts in crisis situations. Thus, this is not a 
reversion, as you put it, to the "Ogarkov" principle, but the 
creation of an ADS on a new footing. The experiment is being 
conducted to prevent mistakes when this system is set up. 
  [Poroskov] The Russian president's edict on the organization 
of aerospace defense was the basis of the reform and development 
of the Air Defense Forces. What made it necessary to create 
aerospace defense? 
  [Kondratyev] Analysis of the experience of recent wars and 
conflicts, including the Gulf War, shows that wide-ranging 
massive use of offensive aerospace weapons is assigned the main 
role in ensuring the success of a military campaign. Ground 
forces do not embark on active operations unless these weapons 
have engaged the opposing grouping. 
  The emphasis is obviously shifting toward the creation and 
use of unmanned, high-precision, low-signature offensive 
aerospace weapons that can operate from space and the air at the 
same time. The fact that the combat potential of the whole 
arsenal of these weapons is being constantly enhanced is 
convincing evidence that the bulk of the initial phase of an act 
of aggression will be determined by fierce air and space 
warfare. So what is needed is a well-organized unified ADS 
system for the country and the Armed Forces. 
  The General Staff has enlisted the commanders in chief of 
the 
Armed Forces, as well as research organizations under the 
Defense Ministry and other ministries and departments, in 
formulating a concept for the organization of Russia's aerospace 
defense. The latter does not just deter the enemy, which is 
fully in keeping with the essence of our military doctrine. The 
supreme effectiveness of this system provides a material 
foundation for achieving the objectives of strategic troop 
deployment and the Russian Armed Forces' first strategic 
operations. 
  The ADS is in practice based on the existing air defense 
system. That is why the Air Defense Forces are the basis for 
the creation of this system. What is more, the ADS must 
comprise the forces and facilities of other branches of the 
Armed Forces that are capable of combating offensive aerospace 
weapons present and future and be based on the comprehensive use 
of aerospace reconnaissance, missile space and air defense of 
branches of the Armed Forces, and these forces' combat command 
and control systems. 
  [Poroskov] Will questions of a unified information system be 
examined when the ADS is set up regardless of departmental 
jurisdiction? 
  [Kondratyev] The plan is to create an aerospace 
reconnaissance system based on the reconnaissance information 
assets of all branches of the Armed Forces and other Russian 
ministries (in particular the federal reconnaissance and 
aerospace surveillance system) capable of detecting offensive 
aerospace weapons and at the same time forming an integral part 
of the overall early-warning system. Thus, all forces within 
the ADS will receive unified information, and on a real time 
basis, moreover. 
  We are also planning to pursue a unified technical policy 
and unify the arsenal based on one customer for aerospace 
defense arms and hardware and one designer for the command and 
control system. 
  [Poroskov] You have extensive plans and the military are to 
implement them. But, Georgiy Grigoryevich, we know that there 
is a degree of strain in the mental condition of the personnel 
and in their morale: The military legislation package is not 
fully operational, payment of wages is held up, and the housing 
question is an acute one.... The state owes the Moscow Air 
Defense District for instance over 15 billion rubles. What is 
being done to solve these problems? 
  [Kondratyev] The Defense Ministry is working with the 
government to resolve the Army's and Navy's urgent problems. 
The government recently examined the main problems of social 
policy in the sphere of defense organizational development for 
1994. I think that the aim of this policy is to formulate a 
reliable mechanism for the implementation of the decisions that 
have already been adopted. Today we do not lack programs and 
plans for the social protection of servicemen and members of 
their family. But we must carry out our previous plans. And 
for that we need the appropriate structures at federal and 
regional levels as well as financial and material resources. 
  [Poroskov] There are signs of a positive trend in the 
Defense Ministry's actions -- "moving" garrisons from 
"godforsaken holes" closer to cultural centers. "But won't this 
weaken, figuratively speaking, the defense chain on the 
country's borders? 
  [Kondratyev] The minister and the Defense Ministry Collegium 
have decided, where possible and mindful of operational 
assignments, to station units and formations near cities and 
urban-type settlements. This should not be understood literally 
as massing troops in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other oblast 
centers or Russian republic capitals. The defense minister has 
set the task of creating normal living conditions for 
servicemen's families, ensuring that children can go to school 
and kindergarten and do not have to travel 15-30 km as often 
happens. Servicemen will be able to go to cultural centers and 
the stores, live in apartments with all modern conveniences, 
etc. After all, officers, warrant officers, and contract 
personnel are the same as our citizens and should be provided 
with everything they need for a normal life. Naturally, then 
they will give back more during their service. 
  I have already pointed out that formations and units will be 
sited with consideration for their operational mission because 
defense of the borders will not be weakened. What is more, we 
have set about creating mobile forces which are capable of 
massing rapidly in areas where a threat to Russia's security 
arises. 
  Things are tricker with the Air Defense Forces: They are on 
constant readiness, they perform alert duty to guard Russia's 
air borders. That is why we will not be able to redeploy many 
units and subunits -- particularly in the radiotechnical forces 
-- that are stationed on islands in the Arctic Circle, etc. in 
major population centers because that would indeed weaken 
defense. But there is also a solution to this -- camps can be 
set up near population centers and alert duty carried out by the 
so-called "tour of duty method." Duty crews will be taken by 
helicopter or surface transport to their post for 10-15 days and 
their families will live in normal conditions. 
  [Poroskov] Contract personnel could probably particularly 
prove their worth here. But they by no means arrive as 
ready-made specialists. Are there plans to set up training 
subunits for them or will training take different forms? 
  [Kondratyev] Virtually all volunteers undergo special 
training programs lasting 2-5 months at training units, centers, 
schools, and crews, or directly in their subunits. Contract 
servicemen receive a qualification on the job and perfect their 
military proficiency during military training sessions held in 
formations and units and training courses at central and 
district level. 
  In the future given the increase in the number of servicemen 
admitted for contract service and in order to provide training 
in the most complex military specialisms there may be a move to 
create regional training centers that offer up to 10 months' 
training in multiple specialisms. 
  [Poroskov] One last question: Georgiy Grigoryevich, you 
have left your Turkestan District comrades in arms outside 
Russia and you yourself admit that your heart bleeds for them. 
Most officers who have ended up in national armies by the will 
of fate want to return to the Russian Army and spend their leave 
trying to find themselves a job, but they are by no means always 
successful. So how can a Russian officer return to his own army? 
  [Kondratyev] This is a very sensitive problem. Barring 
Ukraine and Belorussia [Belarus], the newly-formed national 
armies in nearby foreign countries have virtually no officers. 
The leadership of these states is trying to keep Russian 
officers, sometimes by not very civilized means. Regrettably, 
even in those states with which Russia has agreements on these 
matters and which have signed the Collective Security Treaty, 
officers feel uncomfortable, to put it mildly. When they leave 
they are prohibited from privatizing and selling their 
apartments, taking their cars and personal possessions with 
them, and they pay heavy duties. You know about the death of 
our officers in Georgia and Ukraine. It is very hard to hear 
and talk about this. Regrettably, our Foreign Ministry is not 
providing any clear-cut detail on this issue. I am not the only 
one whose heart bleeds for them -- there is also the defense 
minister as well as all commanders and commanders in chief. But 
we will try to help them and we are helping them. Those who 
have firmly decided to serve in the Russian Army are gradually 
taking up posts there. But let those who have sworn an oath to 
another state serve the people whose oath they have sworn. We 
have no room for them. 
  In order to return home an officer must put in a formal 
request which will be sent to the Russian Armed Forces Main 
Cadres Directorate. The officer will be sent to his post once 
his assignment has been agreed and decided. 
  We expect the Russian Armed Forces to fully accord with the 
new tasks as laid down by the basic provisions of our military 
doctrine when carrying out our ideas.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- The Russian cargo spaceship 
"Progress M-22" was launched at 7:54 a.m. Moscow time (4:54 a.m. 
GMT) on Tuesday. The unmanned spaceship is to deliver 
disposable materials and various cargoes to the russian manned 
orbital station "Mir". The "Progress M-22" was put into orbit 
with the following parameters: 
  - period of revolution -- 90.2 minutes; 
  - orbital inclination -- 51.7 degrees; 
  - maximum distance from the earth's surface -- 335 
kilometers; 
  - minimum distance from the earth's surface -- 260 
kilometers; 
  According to a spokesman for the press center of the 
aerospace military forces, the docking of the launched cargo 
spaceship with the orbital manned complex "Mir" is planned for 
9:39 a.m. on March 24. 
  The start of the cargo spaceship originally scheduled for 
March 19, was delayed for three days due to heavy snowfalls in 
the area of the launching site. The snow drifts were up to six 
meters high, a spokesman for the flight control center told 
ITAR-TASS on Tuesday adding that the fire which occurred at the 
Baykonur cosmodrome on March 7 had nothing to do with the delay 
of the launch. The cargo spaceship "Progress M-22" has become 
the 1101st space object launched into orbit from the Baykonur 
cosmodrome since the beginning of the space era -- October 4, 
1957.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 22, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis 
Ulmanis met Tuesday [22 March] with the country's 14-member 
delegation that reached the March 15 troop withdrawal agreement 
with Russia. 
  The group discussed the recent public opinion poll on the 
troop withdrawal and the prolonged functioning of the former 
Soviet radar at Skrunda in Latvia. 
  According to the poll, 52 percent of respondents want Russia 
to withdraw the Skrunda base together with the other remaining 
troops. 
  The situation may have two explanations -- either the people 
really protest the signature of like agreements or they lack 
information on what the favorable solution of the problem could 
give to Latvia. The participants of the meeting agreed that the 
government should work to better inform the public about its 
work and intentions.

  [Text] Riga, 23 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Latvian Prime Minister 
Valdis Birkavs categorically rejected accusations by the 
opposition that the delegation to the talks with Russia, which 
initialled a package of agreements on the withdrawal of Russian 
troops a week ago, betrayed the interests of the state. "Only 
the enemies of Latvia will benefit if these documents are not 
signed," he told journalists. 
  The meeting with the press took place Tuesday evening after 
the Cabinet meeting at which the accords reached with Russia 
were discussed. It is expected that the government will 
officially announce its support for them next week. Then the 
presidents and parliaments of the two countries will express 
their attitude to them. 
  Valdis Birkavs emphasized that international public opinion 
approves the agreements reached with Russia. The prime minister 
also expressed confidence that many countries will be able to 
help Latvia with the means for dismantling the Russian radar 
station at Skrunda and also for improving the health of the 
residents of that settlement.

<F P=106> [Article by Janis Kulmanis: "Germany Will Support the Baltic </F>
States in Their Efforts To Join the EU"] 
  [Text] Riga, 9 Mar -- Beginning on 1 July, when Germany 
assumes the rotating Presidency of the European Union [EU], it 
will do everything in its power to ensure that negotiations on 
concluding an association agreement with the three Baltic states 
are started immediately, German Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus 
Kinkel announced today in Bonn, during his meeting with the 
three Baltic foreign ministers. Latvian Ambassador in Germany 
Andris Kesteris told DIENA in a telephone interview that a few 
months prior to Germany assuming the leadership post, it wants 
to clarify, along with the Baltic states, what concrete steps 
should be taken to reach this goal. 
  Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs Andrejevs presented 
a 
speech on the problem of Baltic states receiving associate 
status in the EU, saying that by granting associate member 
status to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the EU could affect a 
much more effective neutralization of the Russian concept of the 
"near abroad" -- this according to the press center of the 
Latvian Foreign Affairs Ministry. "These concepts -- near 
abroad and zone of special interests -- are denied categorically 
by us and our neighbors," said K. Kinkel, according to REUTER. 
As DIENA correspondent in Bonn O.J. Rozitis reports, referring 
to information released by the German Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs on K. Kinkel's consultations with the Baltic foreign 
affairs ministers on the morning of 9 March, K. Kinkel 
emphasized that the Baltics have always mirrored European 
stability. This is why Germany is interested in consolidating 
relations between the Baltic states and Russia. As an example, 
K. Kinkel cited the positive role of Germany in talks between 
the United States [as published] and Latvia concerning a 
compromise on the Skrunda radar station. 
  A. Kesteris told DIENA that in the course of discussing the 
relations of the Baltic states with Russia, the German minister 
of foreign affairs expressed his approval of the Russian troop 
withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August of this year, 
and congratulated the foreign ministers on the agreement which 
was reached on the issue of the Skrunda radar station continuing 
to function, albeit temporarily, after the troops are withdrawn. 
The Latvian ambassador to Germany stated that the problems of 
the inhabitants who came to Latvia after the 1940 occupation are 
understood by Germany with greater precision. 
  The DIENA correspondent in Bonn, Ojars J. Rozitis, reports 
that the British newspaper FINANCIAL TIMES has cited the German 
foreign affairs minister as saying that Russia should not link 
the withdrawal of its troops from the Baltic states with the 
rights of Russians residing in these states. After the recent 
break in Russian-Estonian talks, Great Britain and the United 
States have also expressed similar opinions. This question is 
also said to be a topic of U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's talks with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, which are scheduled for next Monday [14 March] in 
Vladivostok. 
  At the same time, world press agencies report that during 
the 
meeting with the Baltic foreign affair ministers, the German 
minister of foreign affairs encouraged Latvia and Estonia to 
integrate the Russian minority. This integration is vital for 
future relations with Russia, the chief German diplomat said, 
advising the Balts to avoid angering the Russian nationalists 
and to promise to observe the rights of ethnic Russians. 
  In reply to a question at a news conference, as to what 
could 
possibly be the reaction of the West if Russia does not comply 
with its agreements, Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Georgs 
Andrejevs answered that thus far Latvia has fulfilled all the 
recommendations of Western countries. The West has accepted it, 
and therefore they will be responsible for it, G. Andrejevs 
said. The German foreign affairs minister agreed on that point. 
Nevertheless, K. Kinkel expressed the belief that it would not 
be advisable to create sharp, provocative political borders with 
Russia. At the same time, K. Kinkel emphasized that during his 
recent meeting with Russian Foreign Affairs Minister A. Kozyrev 
in Athens, he told him categorically that Germany expects Russia 
to observe its international obligations regarding troop 
withdrawal from the Baltic states, O.J. Rozitis reports. 
  Germany is categorically against granting Russia a special 
mandate for peacekeeping on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union. In the event it becomes necessary, it should be the 
mandate of the United nations or CSCE, for every different case, 
providing that the legal government of the country agrees to it. 
The Baltic states should not be included in the formula of "the 
former republics of the USSR." Such is the position of Germany 
conveyed by the press center of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. O.J. Rozitis reports that the Baltic foreign ministers 
unanimously stated at the press conference that they are not 
afraid of close relations between Russia and Germany, or Western 
countries in general, because only with the assistance of these 
countries can Moscow be influenced. "The only thing we fear is 
that these big countries may once again sacrifice our small 
countries for the purpose of stabilization," said G. Andrejevs. 
  As for the often asked question concerning so-called human 
rights violations, A. Kesteris told DIENA that this question had 
not even been mentioned during the talks of the four ministers. 
  Issues related to the Partnership for Peace program and the 
associative status of the Baltic states with the Western 
European Union were also discussed.

  [Text] Military commanders of Lithuania, Latvia, and 
Estonia, who are meeting in Jurmala, have signed an agreement on 
further cooperation in the formation of a joint Baltic 
peacekeeping battalion, Baltbat, said Jonas Andriskevicius, 
commander of the Lithuanian Army, at a news conference today. 
  He also informed the press that a letter to the presidents 
of 
the three states, the prime ministers, and the ministers of 
defense was signed in Jurmala. They are asked in the letter to 
politically legalize the formation of this battalion. 
  The main attribute of the Baltbat was approved at the 
meeting. 
  The battalion's flag will depict symbols of all three Baltic 
states. The joint battalion will consist of five units -- 
staff, supply, and three infantry units. It will have 722 
servicemen: 64 officers, 121 non-commissioned officers, and 537 
soldiers. It is expected that the first Baltbat will be formed 
at the end of 1995. The official language used in the battalion 
will be English. The commander of the first Baltic battalion 
will be a Lithuanian. Soldiers will be admitted to the battalion 
according to a contract.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 21, BNS -- Latvia needs a uniform system 
of customs tariffs for all goods, according to recommendations 
from the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund. 
  The country's legislation should provide a common customs 
duty but it should be implemented gradually to prevent a too 
rapid unification of tariffs, said WB coordinator in Latvia, 
Inguna Dobraja. 
  A WB mission worked in Riga last week and acquainted itself 
with the local system of customs tariffs in view of introducing 
a new model, Dobraja said. 
  WB experts suggested that Latvia promotes exports by 
repaying 
customs duty for exported goods which are made with imported 
equipment and raw materials, Dobraja noted. 
  The WB mission toured the Riga trade port, the Riga airport 
and a customs checkpoint to study the local conditions. 
  The mission will prepare a detailed survey on the results of 
the visit. But they already noticed that Latvia needs to 
improve the customs bookkeeping and revise the mechanism of 
collecting customs duties. 
  The customs duties should be collected through non-cash 
accounting to avoid corruption, the WB specialists said. 
  The next WB mission will continue to study the Latvian 
customs late in April.

  [Text] Riga, March 22 (LETA) -- In 1993 real family 
incomes in Latvia dropped by 5.6 percent, reported the state 
committee for statistics, which keeps the budget of 1300 
families under unceasing control. In comparison with the last 
year incomes rose by 37.5 percent, while consumer prices 
increased by 2.1 times. As a result of the lowered common 
purchasing power the actual value of goods bought and pay 
services also decreased. The family consumer structure has 
distorted in a way that the bulk of money expenses are 
undertaken to pay for food, public utilities and taxes. The 
asked families spent more than two thirds of their incomes in 
1993 for these purposes: 44 percent for food, 19.5 percent for 
other necessary goods, 19.2 for pay services. Poor families in 
1993 spent 77 percent of their funds for food, public utilities, 
transport and other necessary expenses.

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- The Russian and Japanese 
sides expressed common aspiration for the intensification of the 
whole complex of Russo-Japanese ties, the development of 
relations up to the level of genuine partnership and deepening 
of mutual understanding, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the 
Information and Press Department of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, told a briefing here today. 
  The briefing was devoted to the results of the March, 19-21 
visit to Russia of Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister of Japan. The head of the Japanese Foreign 
Office was received by Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev. 
  Participants in the talks spoke for maintaining the new 
political climate in bilateral relations in accordance with the 
provisions of the Tokyo declaration signed in October last year 
by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  Both sides expressed the intention to raise the level of the 
Russo-Japanese inter-governmental dialogue on trade and economic 
issues with the aim of further intensification of mutually 
beneficial ties in this sphere. 
  Moscow and Tokyo agreed to continue contacts on the issues 
connected with the advancement to the conclusion of a peace 
treaty between the two countries including within the framework 
of the working group on a peace treaty at the level of deputy 
foreign ministers. 
  Both sides expressed understanding that the solution to the 
territorial problem which is one of the aspects of a peace 
treaty, requires gradual and careful actions within the 
framework of the existing agreements. 
  When discussing international issues, Grigoriy Karasin said, 
Russian and Japanese foreign ministers stated similarity or 
closeness of positions on a majority of actual problems. 
Serious attention was given to the situation in the 
Asian-Atlantic region where both sides see the possibility to 
continue specific interaction in the settlement of the current 
problems. 
  Tsutomu Hata and Andrey Kozyrev confirmed common 
understanding of the need to continue active contacts and 
promote progressive development of the Russo-Japanese political 
dialogue with the aim of strengthening goodneighborly relations, 
partnership and trust between the two countries in the interests 
of the peoples of Russia and Japan. 
  Both sides attach priority significance to carrying out an 
intensive preparation for a new Russo-Japanese summit meeting 
during an official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa to Moscow the date of which will be agreed upon 
additionally through diplomatic channels.

  [Text] Moscow is concerned about the course of the 
fulfillment of the agreement between the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea. This was stated at a 
briefing today by Gregory Karasin, director of the Department of 
Information and Press of the Russian Foreign Ministry. In 
particular, he called attention to a statement by Pyongyang that 
puts in doubt the constant inspection by the IAEA of North 
Korean nuclear installations and threatens to leave the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Russian diplomat stressed that 
North Korea should remain a participant in the treaty and fully 
implement its obligations. Grigory Karasin spoke in favor of 
bilateral and multilateral talks aimed at removing tension 
around this question.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 23 Mar -- We appeal to the sides for a 
political solution to the Korean peninsula problem, questions 
must be tackled by political and diplomatic measures, the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent was told today by a high-ranking 
representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian 
Federation. The efforts of Russian diplomacy are directed at 
this. We are in contact with all the sides. The heat of 
passion should be lowered. Russia is firmly pursuing the line 
of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, including on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Replying to a question regarding the possibility of economic 
sanctions by the international community against the DPRK, which 
is suspected of developing nuclear weaponry, the Russian 
diplomat noted that the problem of sanctions did not yet stand 
on a practical plane. Sanctions are an extreme measure after 
all political possibilities have been exhausted, he stressed in 
conclusion. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The brief talks held in Moscow Tuesday morning [22 
March] between a Russian delegation and a mission from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) "had a working character". 
"The stands taken by the two sides were a long way from 
compromise," INTERFAX was told by a senior official from 
Russia's Finance Ministry. 
  The IMF delegation wants the main differences connected with 
the granting of the 2nd half of the $1.5 Bn [billion] credit to 
be discussed between Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, and the head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus. 
  The two men are to confer Tuesday evening, the Finance 
Ministry source said. The acting Finance Minister, Sergey 
Dubinin, is expected to join them. 
  This stand will make it possible for the IMF leadership "not 
to miss the main thing" during the upcoming meeting with 
Chernomyrdin -- that is obtain official assurances on the 
fundamental issues, the Finance Ministry official said. 
  In answer to INTERFAX's question about prospects for the 
work 
of the IMF mission in Moscow after Camdessus's departure, the 
source said that two possibilities are the most probable. 
  First: further talks will be halted after fruitless meetings 
between the head of the IMF and the Russian leadership. The 
other possibility is this -- the dialogue will continue, 
provided that Moscow and the IMF reach a compromise. In this 
case the two sides will have to coordinate "three or four" 
figures connected with the parameters of Russia's economy.

credit," said the premier. He thanked IMF specialists for

  [Text] On Tuesday evening in Moscow, Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Michel Camdessus, managing director of 
the International Monetary Fund, signed a joint statement on 
allocation to Russia of the second part of the systemic 
transformation credit totaling $1.5 billion. 
  According to the document, the Russian cabinet accepts the 
obligation to take into consideration the IMF recommendations on 
the budget. Camdessus pledges to submit for consideration a 
draft resolution on allocation of the second part of the 
systemic credit to the board of directors of this international 
organization. 
  In his interview with journalists, Russian Economics 
Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin, who participated in the talks, explained that 
the Russian Government obligated itself to prepare and forward a 
package of legislative initiatives to the State Duma before 
mid-April. The documents are aimed at revising and partially 
suspending several presidential decrees and laws and government 
resolutions, which lead to a growth on the expenditure part of 
the budget, and at proposing concrete measures to fulfill the 
revenues part. 
  According to Shokhin, the decision to allocate the second 
part of the IMF systemic credit opens the way for Russia to 
receive the so-called second rehabilitation credit of the World 
Bank amounting to $600 million and grants opportunities to 
restructure the foreign debt to be paid off in 1994. 
  Shokhin added that the draft budget prepared by the 
government and forwarded to the State Duma already contains 
foreign credits for 1994 totaling $2.1 billion. 
  Having signed this joint statement, the International 
Monetary Fund in fact showed its approval of the government's 
activity in the economic sphere, said Shokhin. 
  Chernomyrdin reported to journalists that he had discussed 
the issue on the IMF credit during his meeting with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin in Sochi because, he said, it is "a very 
serious issue." 
  For his part, Camdessus said that in the course of the 
negotiations in Moscow he was convinced of the Russian 
president's and government's resolution to pursue the course of 
reforms.

  [Excerpt] Moscow (DDP/ADN) -- There are no differences of 
opinion in German-Russian relations, the foreign ministers of 
the two countries, Klaus Kinkel and Andrey Kozyrev, said in 
Moscow today following talks. Germany and Russia shared the 
same positions on the main political events of the moment, they 
stressed. 
  During a joint news conference, Kinkel reaffirmed that 
Germany "will support with all its power the signing of a 
long-overdue cooperation agreement between the European Union 
and Russia." Germany would have ample scope for this when it 
assumed the EU Presidency on 1 July. He said Russia remained a 
reliable partner, both multilaterally and bilaterally. 
  Kinkel gave the Russian Minister of Culture Yevgeniy Sidorov 
a personal message from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl regarding 
the return of cultural items. 
  Kinkel and Kozyrev said they also discussed preparations for 
the planned visit by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Germany 
in May. Kinkel said he had gained the impression during his stay 
that Yeltsin was in full control of the situation in Russia. 
  The ministers said their meeting also covered international 
issues such as the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Middle East. Kinkel praised Russia's involvement in securing a 
compromise between the warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Article by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev: </F>
"Russia Is Predestined To Be a Great Power"] 
  [Text] There is only one way to achieve an open, stable, 
and democratic Russia: Close cooperation between Russia and the 
United States. But then both parties must be prepared to 
compromise. 
  Unfortunately, I must say that in these confusing times we 
cannot count on much understanding and support from our friends 
and allies in the West. 
  Even at this critical moment, now that the democrats need 
full support, we are hearing Western threats that economic 
cooperation with Russia will be limited. 
  Some comments show an almost manic desire for a world with 
just one great power: the United States. This is not very 
realistic. The United States cannot deal with all the world's 
problems on its own; if it were to try, it would just weaken 
itself. 
  Moreover, even in this difficult transitional period, Russia 
remains a superpower. Not just because of its arsenal of 
nuclear weapons and missiles, but also because of its natural 
resources, technological skills, and strategic location. 
  There are reactionary forces in both the United States and 
Russia, the military-industrial and bureaucratic complexes that 
are afraid of losing influence, that are striving for an end to 
the present cooperation. They are spreading myths: "Since 
Russia is simply condemned to eternal totalitarian governments, 
always in confrontation with the outside world, it can never, 
from a historical point of view, travel the same path as the 
West." 
  It appears that some Western politicians, in Washington and 
elsewhere, see Russia as a younger rather than an equal partner. 
In this view of things a "good Russian" is always a follower 
and never a leader. 
  Right from the start, politicians in both Russia and the 
West 
who thought pragmatically based their policy on two assumptions. 
First, Russia is predestined to be a great power, not a 
second-rank power. Under a communist or nationalist regime it is 
aggressive and a threat, while under a democratic government it 
would be peaceful and prosperous. 
  Second, cooperative links, like those between the United 
States and Russia, do not prevent forceful and even aggressive 
policies to defend self-interests. 
  This can sometimes lead to disagreement. That is not 
serious, as long as the situation remains one of compromise 
rather than confrontation. It is naive to expect that great 
powers like Russia and the United States must and can always 
live together in harmony. 
  A particularly promising example of cooperation was the U.S. 
readiness to involve Russian experts in determining the 
principles for the export of militarily useful technology from 
the West to the former Communist countries and countries which 
are accused of supporting terrorism. 
  How should the Russian democrats answer the new chauvinistic 
wind blowing in Washington? Russia cannot agree to playing a 
subordinate role in the world. That would be unjust and 
politically dangerous. Extreme nationalists and other 
reactionaries would quickly reap a profit. 
  While the idea that the Americans are in charge of the world 
is dangerous, there remains an urgent need for U.S. leadership 
because of the special position of the United States in the G-7 
and NATO. 
  NATO was set up to resist communism and defend the Western 
democracies from the threat emanating from it. But nowadays 
NATO is no longer sufficient for two reasons: It no longer has 
communism as its greatest enemy and Russia is not a member. 
  What role could NATO play in solving the big international 
conflicts? The organizational problems could be solved in part 
by the Partnership for Peace proposed by the United States, 
which various countries in Eastern and Central Europe have in 
the meantime joined and which is also acceptable to Russia. 
  But even this should not be seen as true cooperation, as has 
been painfully demonstrated in the Bosnian crisis. The NATO 
ultimatum on Sarajevo was made while Russia was not involved in 
any way. It is unacceptable to exclude Russia from attempts to 
solve the situation in Bosnia, where Russia has present and 
future interests. 
  We must urgently make a start on a strategy for achieving a 
mature and realistic relationship -- dare we call it realpolitik?

  [Text] Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoriy Karasin welcomed 
the agreements signed in Washington between Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats. "We view them as a substantial link in the general chain 
of international efforts aimed at untying the Bosnian knot," he 
said. 
  Nevertheless, the diplomat said, there are still several 
unclear questions, above all concerning the possible status of 
the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and territorial limits. 
  "Considering that relations between the Serbs and the Croats 
are of key importance in the endeavors to resolve the entire 
Yugoslav crisis, Russian diplomacy is building up its efforts in 
this direction along the Belgrade-Zagreb and the Zagreb-Knin 
line," he said. "We expect that it will become possible to 
reach an agreement on ceasing fire and halting military actions 
on Tuesday [22 March] as a result of talks to be held in the 
Russian embassy in Zagreb between the Croat leaders and local 
Serbs," he said.

  [Text] An official representative of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry, Grigory Karasin, said that an agreement between the 
PLO and Israel on continuation of the Mideast peace talks and a 
final agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho had been shaped 
during the contacts the Russian president envoy Viktor Posuvaluk 
had with the PLO leadership, the Israeli delegation and U.S. and 
Norwegian high-ranking diplomats in Tunis. 
  According to Karasin, Posuvaluk had transferred a personal 
message from Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to PLO 
leader Yasir 'Arafat. The message calls for renewal of the 
talks and confirms the intention of the Russian co-sponsor to 
contribute to implementation of the UN Security Council's 
resolution 904. 
  Russia believes that the adoption of this resolution, in 
particular providing for international participation in ensuring 
safety for Palestinians living on the occupied territories, 
creates the necessary atmosphere for a move forward in the 
Arab-Israeli dialogue, the Russian Foreign Ministry's 
representative Karasin said.

  [Text] Russia's Deputy Defense Minister General Georgiy 
Kondratyev in an interview with INTERFAX Tuesday [22 March] said 
he was opposed to the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers from 
Tajikistan. He said Tajikistan would plunge into a new war as 
soon as Russian troops were gone. On the plight of the Russian 
community there, Kondratyev said there was no possibility of 
evacuating them to Russia at the moment because of the country's 
economic hardships. 
  The general said that Russian peacekeepers were used as a 
stopgap in areas of conflict or wars which might spill over to 
Russian territory if no measures were taken in time. 
  He also spoke of Russia's geopolitical interests saying that 
an estimated 25 million Russians living in other republics of 
the former Soviet Union needed protection.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report on interview with Deputy Defense </F>
Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev; place and date not 
given: "Russian Peacemaking Forces In Operation...."] 
  [Text] Information on the status of peacemaking forces was 
released 22 March by the Russian Ministry of Defense. 
  At present, Russian troop contingents are performing 
peacemaking missions in Bosnia (UN peacemaking forces), 
Tajikistan (collective CIS peacemaking forces), the Dniester 
Region, and South Ossetia. 
  In January 1994, the independent Russian infantry battalion 
in Bosnia was increased to 1,200 men. The battalion is serving 
in the "East" sector. The bulk of the battalion's forces are 
located on the 36 checkpoints separating the forward positions 
of the Serbs and Croats. For the purposes of monitoring the 
cease-fire in Sarajevo, a Russian battalion unit (400 men) 
completed a two-day march along mountain roads and took up 
positions along the dividing line. 
  In the Dniester Region, Russian peacekeeping forces are 
represented by four motorized infantry battalions with an 
overall strength of around 1,800 men. 
  In South Ossetia, there is one motorized infantry battalion 
numbering 523 men. Apart from this, there are around 1,000 
Russian servicemen in Abkhazia. 
  Russian peacekeeping forces are subordinate to the Ministry 
of Defense, which exercises command and control through Deputy 
Minister Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev. General Kondratyev 
explains: 
  [Kondratyev] Peacekeeping forces are made up purely of 
volunteers from among servicemen's ranks. They undergo special 
training at a Russian Army training center. Personnel 
participate in dividing the conflicting sides, escorting 
humanitarian aid cargoes, evacuating the population from combat 
zones, and blocking the flow of weapons into the conflict zones. 
However, it is worth distinguishing between the terms 
"peacekeeping forces" and "collective peacemaking forces" in 
which we are taking part. The collective peacemaking forces 
comprise the 201st Motorized Infantry Division with 
reinforcements, which is stationed in Tajikistan. Not long ago, 
the 27th Guards Motorized Infantry Division and the 45th Guards 
Motorized Infantry Division, as well as an independent parachute 
battalion, were allocated from the Russian Armed Forces to 
perform peacemaking functions. 
  [Burbyga] What losses have been incurred by the troop 
contingents performing peacemaking functions? 
  [Kondratyev] Unfortunately, there have been losses. In all, 
we have lost 107 men, and 193 servicemen have been wounded. 
  As of today, five groups of Russian UN military observers 
are 
taking part in peacekeeping operations being performed under the 
aegis of the United Nations. There are 16 men in the Near East. 
That is, eight in Egypt, four in Israel, three in Syria, and one 
in Lebanon, while there are 15 men on the Iran-Kuwait border, 30 
men in the Western Sahara, two men in Cambodia, and 23 
servicemen in Yugoslavia. 
  [Burbyga] What kind of funds are being earmarked to finance 
these operations? 
  [Kondratyev] In 1992 alone, over 2.5 billion rubles [R] (at 
1992 prices) were spent on financing peacekeeping operations on 
former Union territory from the Defense Ministry budget, while 
in 1993 this figure was over R26 billion. [Kondratyev ends] 
  As of 22 March, the number of dead among servicemen 
performing peacemaking functions was 107, while the number of 
wounded was 193. 
  In terms of regions, the figures break down as follows:

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report: "Deal With United States Is </F>
Advantageous"] 
  [Text] The "uranium deal" with the United States is 
advantageous to Russia, Nikolay Yegorov, Russian Federation 
deputy minister of atomic energy, believes. It will help 
Russian enterprises to survive. 
  On his return from Washington, where he signed an 
appropriate 
document with the U.S. secretary of commerce, Nikolay Yegorov 
disclosed that over the next two years Russia will now be able 
to supply the United States with up to 3,000 tonnes of uranium 
concentrate and a considerable quantity of enriched uranium 
worth a total of $150 million. Previously there were no 
deliveries in view of the agreement imposed on Russia in 1992 
whereby the export of Russian uranium was authorized only at 
prices that were effectively 1.5 times the world prices, the 
deputy minister emphasized. 
  Now an opportunity is opening up to resume sales on U.S. 
markets, which will help Russian uranium-extracting enterprises 
to improve their position. A special feature of the new 
agreement is the establishment of a procedure for joint sales 
whereby 50 percent of the Russian deal is combined with a 
similar quantity of American sales, and this mixed uranium is 
sold to consumers. 
  "The next two years will be especially difficult for 
Russia," 
Nikolay Yegorov said. "So the extra sources of freely 
convertible currency will come in very handy."

  [Text] Moscow, March 22 (SNARK)--As it has become known to 
SNARK from unofficial sources, the former Azerbaijan President 
Ayaz Mutalibov, drawn to criminal liability by the present Baku 
authorities, is compelled to hide himself in one of the Russian 
cities. 
  A source close to Mutalibov's surrounding told SNARK that 
the 
ex-president considers Geydar Aliyev as main guilty person in 
Karabakh conflict. He claimed that Aliyev, while being the 
First Secretary of Azerbaijan Communist Party, pursued a policy 
of human rights infringement among the national minorities 
living in the republic: of Lezghins, Kurds, Talishes, Tats, 
Avars, and of Armenians. This policy resulted in the open 
confrontation. 
  Escape from the crisis is seen by Mutalibov in account of 
interests of all national minorities living in Azerbaijan, 
namely in federalization of political system in the republic, 
with whom he never cut off his relations while living outside. 
  Speaking about the Karabakh war, Mutalibov observed that it 
is lost due to policy of illegal, as he thinks, presidents 
Elchibey and Aliyev, who for the sake of their own ambitions had 
cast their people into a real slaughter.

  [Text] Yerevan, March 22 (SNARK) -- The Armenian Foreign 
Ministry has given a range of criminal cases that are supposed 
to be connected with jobs' abusement of some top officials of 
the republic to the Office of Prosecutor. The Armenian General 
Prosecutor Artavazd Gevorkyan told about the fact at the session 
of the temporary parliamentary commission created for 
investigating these cases. 
  "These are not simple criminal cases because they are 
connected with activities of some officials. An investigation 
will figure them out," Mr.Gevorkyan said. 
  The temporary parliamentary commission was created after 
some 
statements of the Home Minister Vano Siradegyan, the former 
Chief Advisor of the President on National Security Ashot 
Manucharyan and other persons. It will work till June 1. Its 
main aim is to control activity of special investigating group 
of the prosecutor's office. As the Commission Chairman Agasi 
Arshakyan said today, the conclusion and findings of the

<F P=106> [Gamlet Matevosyan report from Yerevan under the "Armenia" </F>
rubric: "Parliament Approves 1994 Budget, but Rejects 
Government Program for the Republic's Socioeconomic Development"] 
  [Text] After a lengthy debate and two ballots, the 
Armenian Supreme Soviet has finally approved the budget report 
on 1993 and the draft budget for 1994. At the same time, the 
parliament has rejected the government program for the 
republic's socioeconomic development and monetary policy for the 
current year, which were opposed by the "Dashnaktsutyun" 
Armenian Revolutionary Union and the National Democratic Union 
factions. In addition, the "Dashnaktsutyun" faction proposed 
that the parliament's standing commission on legal matters draw 
up a draft on reallocating the powers of the Supreme Soviet and 
the president. 
  The opposition has accused the government of lacking a clear 
model of the republic's economic development and the principles 
of improving the government system, and also specific social 
safety nets. 
  The parliamentary debate has shown that the opposition 
itself 
lacks a specific program to lift the republic out of the crisis. 
For all the abundance of criticism, no viable alternative to 
Bagratyan's policy has been proposed. In the view of some 
observers, the opposition acts according to the principle "Let's 
topple the government first, and then we will see." According 
to a local independent newspaper, "in case events unfold this 
way the people risk choosing between two evils." During the 
discussion, some opposition deputies have made so radical 
proposals (for instance, on concentrating all the state's 
financial reserves in the hands of one institution) that the 
prime minister accused them of calling for "economic fascism." 
  In Bagratyan's view, even in the current difficult 
conditions, with the minimum resources available, the government 
may improve macroeconomic indicators by 15-17 percent.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] If we have foreign money, our 
bank headed by Viktor Andreevich [Yushchenko] will become a 
branch of the Russian Central Bank. This is normal, we should 
not blame the Russian Bank; this is a normal agreement. If you 
are going to introduce the ruble, you have to become a branch. 
Then, the newly elected deputies will gather in the Supreme 
Council and will have to adopt decisions concerning their money, 
on [words indistinct], taxation and they will be told that this 
does not correspond to the interests of the Russian National 
Bank. This is normal. Therefore, under these conditions, the 
people will be allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will 
not be allowed to adopt (?independent decisions). Therefore, we 
-- myself, the prime minister, and the National Bank chairman -- 
are here to stress that this is a symbol of our independence. 
If you hear talk about something else, this is only a deception 
and represents an attempt to swindle the people. I do not want 
to focus your attention on this particular aspect, but money, 
finances, and banks are symbols. When reforms begin -- well, 
they have already begun -- [words indistinct] in Ukraine will 
set up our own banking system.

<F P=106> [Zakhar Butyrskyy report: "L. Kuchma and V. Hrynyov Are </F>
Preparing a Party"] 
  [Text] On 15 March, the attention of journalists became 
focused on a well-known organization, which has been 
particularly active on the eve of the elections: The 
Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR]. A news conference of the 
MBR cochairmen Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov was held in 
the lecture-hall of the Union of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs. 
  According to them, a few days ago, at the second regional 
MBR 
conference in Dnipropetrovsk, 389 out of 500 representatives of 
23 Ukrainian oblasts joined the bloc, and V. Hrynyov and L. 
Kuchma signed an appeal to the people of Ukraine calling upon 
them to attend the elections and, of course, give support to the 
candidates of the MBR. "If, on 27 March, you do not come to the 
elections, this will mean that you do not want changes. If you 
do not come to the elections, the policy, which has placed the 
people on the verge of extinction, will continue. If you do not 
come to the elections, that would mean that you deserve your 
present standard of living. We call upon you to say, on 27 
March, "no" to the isolationist and adventurist policy and "no" 
to the collapse of the economy and to the impoverishment of the 
people. We call upon you to say "yes" to Ukraine's future!" 
reads the appeal. 
  At the beginning, as expected, the program, goals, and 
principles of the MBR were discussed and, toward the end, the 
personality of L. Kuchma was "dealt with." Many people were, 
for example, surprised to read the article on the need to grant 
equal status to the Ukrainian and Russian languages in Ukraine. 
However, the two cochairmen of the MBR look upon this problem 
in a quite simple and calm manner: Why should we argue about 
such "petty matters" now that the economy is nearing total 
collapse? In the opinion of the MBR, contacts with Russia must 
be restored, and Ukraine must become a full member of the 
economic CIS union. "We are convinced that Russia and Ukraine 
must become strategic partners and allies," said Hrynyov. 
  The MBR also considers combating crime to be one of its 
future tasks. According to the MBR, the method of struggle is 
simple. "All power must be concentrated within a single center," 
said L. Kuchma. L. Kuchma's explanation of the so-called 
Crimean issue was quite interesting: "If the wages in the 
Crimea is $21 and in Russia -- $81, the striving of the Crimeans 
is clear and understandable. It is necessary to grant more 
freedom to regions, but this does not mean that it is necessary 
to create 25 Crimeas in Ukraine." Hrynyov, for example, believes 
that there must be free economic zones, but not many of them. 
"I do not think that people will refer to a good place as a 
"zone" [prison camp]," said L. Kuchma. "If we create a zone, 
the rest of the oblasts will do everything to have such a zone 
fail." L. Kuchma sees a solution to the Black Sea Fleet problem 
in leasing it, together with the infrastructure, to Russia, but 
doing as like normal civilized countries do -- on terms 
advantageous for ourselves. 
  The MBR leaders are in no hurry to propose themselves as 
candidates for the post of Ukrainian president. In V. Hrynyov's 
opinion, it is, first, necessary to create a stable faction in 
the parliament, since a future president, if he wants to work 
successfully, must gain the support of the overwhelming majority 
of the population and of a parliamentary majority. 
  The MBR leaders plan, in the case of a favorable alignment 
of 
forces in the parliament, to transform the MBR into a regular 
political party. However this, according to them, will be 
decided at the third conference, which will be held shortly 
after the elections. At present, L. Kuchma is going to tour 
Ukraine's electoral districts in order to win over votes for his 
bloc.

<F P=106> [Announcement released by the Press Service of the President </F>
of the Republic of Crimea: "Announcement"] 
  [Text] In connection with the decree of the Central 
Electoral Commission on elections to the Supreme Soviet of the 
Republic of Crimea of 12 March 1994, the press service of the 
President of the Republic of Crimea is authorized to make the 
following announcement: 
  1. In his edict "On the Conduct of a Poll of Citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea of 27 March 1994," the President of the 
Republic of Crimea, carrying out the will of the voters and also 
taking into account the refusal of the Supreme Council of Crimea 
to remove the moratorium on the conduct of an all-Crimean 
referendum, has ensured the right of citizens of the Republic of 
Crimea to express their opinion on the most important problems 
having general Crimean significance. 
  2. In setting the date of the poll, the president proceeded 
from the fact that, given the assistance of the Central 
Electoral Commission in the course of the simultaneous conduct 
of both the poll and elections of deputies of the Supreme Soviet 
of Crimea, it will be possible to avoid substantial 
organizational and material costs. 
  3. The organization and conduct of the poll of citizens will 
be entrusted to the leaders of executive authorities in the 
localities who will also be the representatives of the Republic 
of Crimea in electoral commissions. 
  4. The sphere of activity of the representatives of the 
president attached to the electoral commissions is confined to 
organizational cooperation between the services of the president 
and the electoral commissions during the preparation and conduct 
of the polling of the citizens of the Republic of Crimea. 
  The president intends to take the will of the citizens of 
Crimea into account in the resolution of the most important 
state problems in the future as well. 
  [Signed] Press Service of the President of the Republic of 
Crimea.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Central Electoral Commission for the </F>
Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea] 
  [Text] On 15 March 1994 the president of the Republic of 
Crimea read out an appeal to the electorate, citizens' 
associations, trade union organizations, workforce, and members 
of electoral commissions, proposing that the members of the 
electoral commissions adopt decisions on the commissions' 
participation in a poll of citizens scheduled by a presidential 
edict for 27 March 1994 with notification of the pertinent 
executive authorities of the decisions on the poll so adopted. 
  In connection with the said appeal the Central Electoral 
Commission declares that: 
  In accordance with Article 5 of the Constitution of the 
Republic of Crimea, the organization and activity of state 
authorities of the Republic of Crimea shall be based on a 
separation of powers, with actions in violation of this 
condition being deemed anticonstitutional. 
  The organization of the work of electoral commissions is 
within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea. The executive's demand for actions by the electoral 
commissions for which provision is not made by the Republic of 
Crimea law "Election of Deputies of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea" without the corresponding decision of the Supreme 
Council of Crimea is not based on law. 
  Considering the difficulty of the elections conducted 
simultaneously by the electoral commissions of deputies of the 
Supreme Council of Crimea and the Supreme Council of Ukraine, 
the Central Electoral Commission calls the attention of the 
electoral commissions to the need for unswerving compliance with 
the Republic of Crimea Constitution and the Republic of Crimea 
law "Election of the Supreme Council of Crimea" and will adopt 
the necessary measures to ensure legality in their activity. 
  Expressing a protest against the unfounded assertions of the 
president of the Republic of Crimea concerning the Central 
Electoral Commission's violations of legislation of the Republic 
of Crimea, the Central Electoral Commission appeals to the 
electorate, political parties, and other public associations of 
the citizens and the workforce to refrain from actions putting 
political pressure on members of the electoral commissions and 
to display forbearance and organization in order to ensure that 
the elections of deputies to the Supreme Council of Crimea on 27 
March 1994 be held in an atmosphere of observance of democracy 
and in full conformity with the requirements of Republic of 
Crimea legislation. 
  [Signed] Central Electoral Commission for the Election of 
Deputies of the Supreme Council of Crimea 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  We asked V. Alsufyev, chairman of the Central Electoral 
Commission, to answer this question: Does this statement mean 
deadlock and a boycott of the president's poll decree? 
  "No, it does not. There is no deadlock and no boycott. A 
poll 
is possible. And the Central Electoral Commission is prepared to 
assist in its execution. But the execution of a poll, not a 
consultative referendum as signified by this word in the 
president's edict. The execution of the latter requires, 
according to the law, a special decision by the Supreme Council."

  [Text] Crimea's Central Electoral Commission has passed a 
resolution on providing support for a poll to be held among the 
peninsula's population, set by Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov 
to take place on 27 March. The commission reports this 
resolution was the result of a compromise between the Central 
Electoral Commission and the autonomy's head of executive power. 
The required changes and amendments to his directive had been 
made by the president, which in commission members' view will 
ensure differences between the directive and the legislation are 
settled. 
  The Central Electoral Commission agreed organizationally to 
help carry out a poll among those wishing to do this. It will 
not, however, take part in determining its results. This 
function is to be performed by officials authorized by the 
Crimean president.

<F P=106> [Boris Sverdlov report: "Donetsk Adds to Voting Slip"] </F>
  [Text] Donetsk -- Donetsk, famed in the late 1980's 
throughout the former Union as a city of millions of roses and 
chestnut-tree-lined boulevards and for its flourishing industry 
and coal deposits, is today on the brink of extinction. 
Enterprises are closing down one after the other. Tens of 
thousands of workers are out of a job, and more still have been 
forced to take unpaid leave. The budget deficit has hit 100 
billion karbovantsy. 
  The budget planned by the government for this year does not 
even have sufficient funds to pay miners' wages. Because of the 
total bankruptcy of the city coffers, the socioeconomic program, 
which requires, according to the most modest calculations, 4.5 
trillion karbovantsy, has been ruined. Thus the city deemed the 
world's most flourishing young industrial center by UNESCO 20 
years ago is falling into decline. 
  Now the sole hope left to the Donbass is for implementation 
of the president's edict granting economic autonomy to the four 
oblasts of southeast Ukraine, which will open the way to revive 
links with Russia and cut contributions to the state budget. 
But for now, unfortunately, owing to existing laws restricting 
self-management in the localities, the oblast administrations 
are unable to make use of the edict. 
  And Kiev's legislators have no particular wish to modify the 
laws. So Oblast Soviet deputies decided during the 
parliamentary elections to conduct a consultative poll of the 
population asking the questions: "Do you support a 
federative-regional structure for Ukraine?" and "Are you in 
favor of Ukraine joining the CIS as a full member?" Although 
the poll has no legal force, it will serve as another reminder 
to the authorities of the view of the inhabitants of the most 
industrialized region. Moreover even today, to judge from 
sociological polls, it is clear that 90 percent will respond to 
these questions in the affirmative. And there is nothing 
surprising in this. If the industrial Donbass were offered full 
autonomy in the quest for markets and raw material suppliers, if 
it were to be rid of at least part of the excessive yoke of 
customs duties, then it would, experts believe, succeed quite 
quickly in stabilizing its economy, which would ultimately have 
a beneficial effect on Ukraine as a whole. 
  One more vital question for voters is included: "Do you 
agree that Ukraine should have a second state language -- 
Russian?" All oblasts in the southeast of the republic, without 
exception, favor bilingualism. And they are awaiting an 
appropriate amendment from the new parliament on this issue.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Zhigalin: "Hopes of Regional Independence </F>
Melt in Greater Kiev"] 
  [Text] As an example, one fact revealing the industrial 
infrastructure of our region. Despite its powerful production 
potential, Donetsk Oblast works for itself only 9 percent, the 
rest--production of the means of production. In today's economic 
chaos, when relations with other regions of the former Union 
have been severed, we are colossally vulnerable. It is now 
essential to move away from single-commodity works, introduce 
the latest technology, and switch to the region's self-support. 
But how is this to be done? 
  The idea for the development of a model of regional 
government, namely, economic independence, which would make it 
possible to extricate the oblast's national economic sectors 
from the crisis, was born in the latter half of 1992. 
Approximately 200 of the best minds, not just of our region, 
embarked on this work. About 40 academic higher educational 
institutions and research and planning institutes were plugged 
into this effort. A comprehensive program of social and economic 
development for the Donbass was prepared in a very short space 
of time. It passed expert evaluation at all levels and gained 
high marks. It seemed that the life of our region would now be 
running in a different channel, in which, thanks to the region's 
independence, industrial potential and agricultural and, what is 
most important, social potential would begin to operate anew. 
  "But today our program is 'spinning its wheels,'" V.L. 
Nakonechnyy, first deputy chief of the oblast administration and 
president of the Foundation for the Support of Progressive 
Reforms, said at a news conference. "Kiev is still reluctant to 
give the regions even a piece of independence, which would 
enable us to resolve our problems ourselves. All our hopes are 
'drowning' in offices of the capital, where people are keeping a 
firm hold on power. We, however, want just one thing--give each 
region its rights, and each region should live on its own 
earnings. These are normal living conditions in world 
practice...." 
  For the comprehensive program to start to work it is 
essential that today the Supreme Council adopt a whole number of 
legislative documents. Its old composition is not that ready to 
agree to this. For this reason the Foundation for the Support of 
Progressive Reforms has resolved to form in the course of the 
present parliamentary elections its own team which undertakes to 
finish what has been started. The developers of the program have 
nominated candidates for deputy.... 
  In the course of the news conference V.L. Nakonechnyy and 
I.P. Navka, executive director of the Foundation, told 
journalists how introduction of the program is being promoted, 
for all that. There are already potential investors, who will 
invest money in a restructuring of the economy of the Donbass. 
And nothing would be holding them back were there a law both 
protecting the investors' money and determining regional 
independence. But Kiev does not have the time for this. It does 
not want to understand that only strong regions will benefit 
Ukraine.

  [Text] The first reactor of a nuclear power plant in 
Zaporozhe (Ukraine) switched off at 8:32 local time on March 22. 
As a plant spokesman has reported to Interfax, the reactor 
disconnected after the safety system was effected by the 
separation of two circular pumps, supplying water to cool off a 
turbine capacitor. 
  In his words, to bring down pressure, steam was released 
into 
the atmosphere from pipelines, and the discharge was accompanied 
by persistent noise. He described the incident as not being 
dangerous for the plant's personnel or the environment. 
  An investigation is underway. The level of radiation at the 
nuclear plant has not changed. 
  As has been reported, the station's third reactor was 
switched off at 13:37 local time on Monday by the warning safety 
device but was switched on again five hours later.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Alexey Petrunya -- TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev March 22 TASS -- Despite the current economic 
difficulties, Ukrainian nuclear power engineering is fulfilling 
its major task of supplying electricity to consumers, chairman 
of the Ukrainian state committee for nuclear energy uses Mikhail 
Umanets told a briefing here today. 
  In 1993 Ukrainian nuclear power plants produced 75,238 
million kilowatt/hours, which is 33 percent of the overall 
Ukrainian electricity output, he said. The electricity 
production amounted to 111 percent of the planned targets. 
  In the words of Umanets, there were no accidents at nuclear 
power plants in 1993, although there were some malfunctions 
eleven of which were estimated as the first level and one -- 
second on the international nuclear accident scale. 
  A radical factor for the development of Ukrainian nuclear 
power engineering is a resolution of the parliament to cancel 
moratorium on construction of new units of nuclear power plants 
and further operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, said 
the official. The resolution provides for the postponed 
termination of Chernobyl plant halt with due account of 
technical and radiation safety. 
  A major problem of Ukrainian nuclear power engineering 
remains fuel, which Ukrainian nuclear power plants continue to 
receive from Russia. Ukrainian scientists and specialists have 
been instructed to create national fuel.

<F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at </F>
joint news conference with U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry in Kiev on 22 March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Radetskyy] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen: Today we 
are summing up the official visit of U.S. Secretary of Defense 
William Perry to Ukraine. This is his first visit to Ukraine in 
his capacity as the U.S. secretary of defense. We regard it as 
a sign of dynamism in the development of relations between our 
countries' military departments. 
  My view is that the negotiations were held in the spirit of 
constructive cooperation, were fruitful, and achieved their aim. 
They once again confirmed Ukraine's intention to travel the path 
of democracy and openness to the world, which had not been 
inherent in the position of the former Soviet Union. 
  The U.S. secretary of defense visited the 46th Missile 
Division's combat positions, which was a historic visit since we 
could not even think about this not so long ago. The 
negotiations convincingly proved that the course towards 
strengthening trust and understanding between the defense 
departments of Ukraine and the United States, initiated by our 
predecessors, is the right one and corresponds with the 
interests of our states and of ensuring peace in Europe. 
  In the course of exchanging our opinions, our views on a 
wide 
variety of issues relating to mutual relations between Ukraine 
and the United States coincided considerably. These issues are 
closely linked to the problems of world and European security. 
  It should also be emphasized that this is the third time 
that 
the secretary and I have met in the last three months, and I 
hope we understand each other well. 
  Ukraine has made its choice in respect of nuclear 
disarmament. The world witnesses how Ukraine's good will with 
regard to lessening the threat of nuclear confrontation is being 
implemented in specific steps in practice. A certain number of 
strategic missiles have already been deactivated and two 
trainloads of nuclear warheads have already left for Russia on 
schedule. 
  We are grateful to the United States for their diplomatic 
efforts, thanks to which the trilateral statement by the U.S., 
Ukrainian, and Russian presidents on nuclear disarmament in 
Ukraine became a reality in action. Financial aid from the 
American side will no doubt ease the heavy burden of nuclear 
disarmament on the economy of Ukraine, which is already in a 
difficult state. 
  We have begun implementing conversion programs and you, Mr. 
Secretary, have already had an opportunity to see it for 
yourself. At the same time, you have come to know our scientific 
and military industrial complex and its potential. We are a 
rocket and space power, which is why the attitude towards us has 
to correspond with the aspects of reality that have arisen. It 
is in this respect that we hope for understanding and support 
from the United States. 
  Our states are actively participating in peacekeeping 
activities under UN auspices. We have reached complete 
understanding with our American colleagues that any political 
issues must primarily be settled by peaceful means. 
  A bloody crisis in the former Yugoslavia demonstrates that 
efforts to prevent the flare-up of military conflicts are vital. 
  Attempts by certain political forces to play the so-called 
Crimean card and provide support overtly or covertly for the 
separatist movement on the peninsula cause concern in Ukraine. 
Ukraine will take all steps required to preserve its territorial 
integrity in a peaceful, civilized way. 
  The fact that the United States consistently stands for the 
inviolability of the existing borders and is not indifferent to 
the Crimean problem, and in particular to the future destiny of 
the Black Sea Fleet, provides us with moral support in a complex 
process of the political settlement of the issue. 
  We reached understanding with Mr. Perry on issues of the 
Black Sea Fleet and the sequence of actions on its division. 
This process should begin by making an inventory of all the 
property and combat machinery the fleet owns. 
  Ukraine was the first CIS state to join NATO's Partnership 
for Peace program. This demonstrates our sincere endeavors to 
develop peaceful, good-neighborly relations with all 
participating countries. The program, initiated by the United 
States, gives hope for the strengthening of the European 
security system. We are certain that within this system Ukraine 
will occupy an important position befitting it. The value of 
the Partnership for Peace program for Ukraine in particular is 
that it gives our state an opportunity to establish multilateral 
ties with every interested country. Ukraine can become a bridge 
of understanding between East and West, the need for which is so 
perceptible. And it is this circumstance that imparts 
particular importance to fruitful bilateral relations between 
the defense departments of Ukraine and the United States. 
  Now we have already achieved certain success in developing 
these bilateral relations. Our ministries' working groups have 
agreed on a work plan consisting of 17 paragraphs, each of which 
contains specific programs for the development of contacts in 
the military sphere. Some of them have already been put into 
practice. In the very near future, we intend to establish with 
our American partners a direct line of communications between 
our states' defense departments. This step will undoubtedly 
help resolve more promptly the problems that arise in our 
relations. 
  We look forward to interesting meetings on a bilateral basis 
and contacts at various levels. In future, we can see 
participation in joint exercises and exchanges of military 
servicemen right from combat subunits. All this inspires hope 
that understanding between our countries' Armed Forces will 
strengthen. 
  Mr. Perry's visit has lived up to the best of our 
expectations. An important document was adopted: an amendment 
to the agreement between our military departments on the 
provision of Ukraine with materials, machinery, and 
communications services in eliminating strategic nuclear 
weapons. Under this amendment, Ukraine will receive an 
additional $50 million towards nuclear disarmament, with the 
total sum to be 185 million. A joint statement has been worked 
out and signed on meeting Ukrainian Armed Forces servicemen's 
daily life and housing needs, providing for aid in the amount of 
$20 million for the construction of housing. 
  In general, the program of the visit was intensive. A 
delegation from the U.S. Department of Defense had meetings with 
our state's leadership, scientists, and representatives of the 
military industrial complex. 
  I express the viewpoint of the Ukrainian side: We evaluate 
the results of Mr. Perry's visit to Ukraine with satisfaction. 
It is the continuation of a constructive dialogue between our 
countries' military. This dialogue is now acquiring certain 
qualities of a good tradition. 
  My deep conviction is that the development of bilateral 
relations between the defense departments of Ukraine and the 
United States will promote stronger peace and stability both in 
Europe and worldwide.

UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov] 
  [Text] Kiev March 22 TASS -- U.S. Defence Secretary William 
Perry has been the first foreign defence minister to visit a 
strategic missile unit in Pervomaysk, Ukraine, and a classified 
military plant in Dnepropetrovsk. 
  Ukraine ranks the world's third in the number of nuclear 
warheads stationed on its territory. It is preceded only by the 
United States and Russia. Two types of missiles are stationed 
in Pervomaysk, the Nikolayev region. Part of missiles have been 
dismantled. 
  The U.S. Pentagon head visited a dismantled missile silo to 
see a de-activated SS-24 missile. The secretary was told by 
Ukrainian servicemen that warheads have been removed from 30 
SS-24 missiles and eleven SS-19 missiles. All in all, this will 
be done to 46 SS- 24 and 30 SS-19 missiles. 
  Last year Ukrainian specialists took off duty two regiments 
of strategic missiles. One of them to include ten systems was 
withdrawn from Pervomaysk. Nuclear warheads have been 
dismantled and sent to technical storages, missiles have been 
removed from silos, fuel and oxidizer were put into special 
tanks, loaded into freight cars and set to the Yuzhmash plant in 
Dnepropetrovsk. 
  The U.S. defence secretary visited the Yuzhmash plant, which 
earlier produced the world's only high-precision heavy missiles 
capable to deliver up to ten warheads of megaton weight. The 
plant and its design bureau produced four generations of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles and made the first 
artificial earth satellite of the Cosmos series together with 
the rocket booster. 
  Now the plant continues to produce space equipment, 
simultaneously with first Ukrainian trolley-buses and wind 
engines.

  [Text] Russia will resume the supply of nuclear fuel to 
Ukraine after it gets next week the $60 Mn promised by the U.S. 
This was reported at a briefing in Kiev on Tuesday by the 
Chairman for Ukraine's Atomic Energy Committee Mikhail Umanets 
after his discussion with Russia's Atomic Energy Minister Victor 
Mikhailov. 
  In the conversation with Umanets, Mikhailov blamed the 
breaking of the time-table for nuclear fuel delivery to Ukraine 
on Russia's failure to settle accounts with a fuel producing 
plant in Novosibirsk (East Siberia). 
  Umanets also reported that by his information the 
Novosibirsk 
plant was interested in the Ukrainian market since Ukraine had 
always been one of its major clients. He declined to give 
concrete figures on fuel shipments on the ground that such 
information is classified. 
  He pointed out that the construction of a nuclear fuel plant 
in Ukraine was "an urgent national task." In his opinion, 
Ukraine has everything that is needed to cope with the task, 
including uranium ore, "which has been supplied to Russia and 
returned as ready-made fuel." 
  "The price at which we buy fuel in Russia amounts to 64 
percent of the prime cost of electricity generated in Ukraine. 
With the commencement of a state fuel producing plant, this 
indicator could be almost halved," Umanets said. 
  In his words, feasibility tests on such a project are to be 
completed this year.

  [Text] Kiev, 22 Mar -- Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister 
Oleksandr Makarenko held a briefing on the results of the fourth 
round of negotiations between delegations of Ukraine and the 
European Community which took place between 14 and 18 March in 
Brussels. The EC expert group at the negotiations was led by 
Fikion Fotiadis, who heads the directorate for relations with 
newly independent nations other than Russia. 
  Mr. Makarenko told journalists that as a result of the 
negotiations Ukraine's agreement with the EC was finalized and 
coordinated with European Commission experts. According to him, 
the initialling of this agreement signifies a practical step by 
Ukraine toward integration in the EC. He said that the success 
of the negotiations was helped by the extension of the European 
Commission's mandate for negotiations with Ukraine approved by 
the EC Council of Ministers on 7 March. The draft agreement was 
technically initialled at the level of experts on 18 March, Mr. 
Makarenko said. It is due to be officially initialled on 23 
March, during Anatoliy Zlenko's visit to Brussels. It is 
planned that the agreement will be signed by the president of 
Ukraine in May-June this year. 
  The agreement is a detailed, comprehensive document 
stipulating the conditions for political, economic, trade, and 
humanitarian cooperation between Ukraine and the EEC. As soon 
as it takes effect, Ukraine will be exempt from quantitative 
trade restrictions (except for textiles, metallurgical products, 
and nuclear components). Under the agreement, Ukraine 
undertakes certain obligations, such as to pursue market 
reforms. The participants at the briefing stressed that the 
content of the document puts to shame those who said Europe does 
not need Ukraine. 
  Oleksandr Makarenko said that Ukraine and the European 
Commission will start talks in 1998 on including Ukraine in the 
free trade zone.

  [Text] If Ukraine joins the France-Germany-Poland axis, 
this will contribute to the spread of Western democracy to the 
East, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko, who is 
currently on an official visit to Warsaw, said at a press 
conference on Tuesday. 
  According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko, this would 
assist with creating a kind of atmosphere that would help to 
resolve many problems on the former USSR territory. Ukraine 
might be a significant addition to the axis, Foreign Minister 
Zlenko suggested. However, he remarked that the issue had not as 
yet been settled. 
  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko did not sound optimistic 
when speaking about possible joining of Russia to the G-7. He 
considered Russian-Ukrainian relations to be normal ones between 
partners. However, he pointed out that there were some unsettled 
problems. 
  Commenting on the Crimean issue, Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Zlenko said "Russia and Ukraine display tolerance towards the 
Crimea." According to him, to resolve the issue as some Crimean 
politicians propose to do would mean transgressing the 
principles of international law. 
  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko confirmed the intention of 
Kiev to settle the issue concerning the Black Sea Fleet in 
accordance with the Yalta, Massandra and Dagomys agreements. He 
said this approach had been agreed upon during his meeting with 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Odessa last autumn.

Zlenko, who is on an official visit in Poland, met with Polish 
President Lech Walesa. The Polish president assessed positively 
the documents that were signed in Warsaw: A declaration on 
principles of Ukrainian-Polish partnership, and an agreement on 
the care of graves and memorial sites of victims of war and 
repression. Lech Walesa also stressed that the joint stance of 
the two states could affect European development. The 
opportunities of our states are enormous, emphasized the Polish 
president. Everything depends on how we step up our cooperation 
to reach the maximum effect. Our special correspondent [word 
indistinct] Andrey (?Shcherba) reports this from Warsaw.

  [Text] Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze has warned that 
if parliament disapproves his suggestion on the composition of 
government, "the issue of the resignation of the entire 
leadership, the head of state included, must automatically 
arise." 
  Speaking in parliament before discussion of the composition 
of the cabinet, he declared that it would be extremely unwise to 
resort "to such decisions (resignations) at this stage." 
  In the meantime, observers forecast volatile parliamentary 
debates Tuesday afternoon. This is borne out by the fact that 
even the parliamentary majority, formed to back Shevardnadze's 
initiatives, withheld support for most candidates nominated by 
him.

  [Text] In Georgia during the parliamentary debate on the 
new cabinet on Tuesday the opposition voiced the need to 
reorganize the entire system of executive power. Among other 
things it suggested abolishing the post of head of state and 
introducing a parliamentary form of government. In addition, in 
a joint statement the opposition turned down the proposed 
cabinet in full. 
  Eduard Shevardnadze was blamed for all the troubles and 
difficulties of the country from the loss of South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia to general starvation. 
  However, despite the protests from the opposition the 
approval of the cabinet began. The very first candidate to the 
post of Vice Premier Irakly Menagarishvili was approved by the 
majority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Meeting With A Delegation From </F>
Dagestan"] 
  [Text] On 16 March, Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the 
Georgian Parliament-head of state, received a delegation from 
the Republic of Dagestan headed by Narbekom Adzhigaitkanov, 
deputy chairman of the Republic of Dagestan Council of 
Ministers. Vice-Premier Avtandil Margiani, Aleksandr Kavsadsze, 
chairman of the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights and 
Interethnic Relations, and Vladimir Zemskiy, Russian Federation 
ambassador in Georgia, were present at the meeting. 
  The conversation focused on the traditional goodneighborly 
relations existing between the two neighboring peoples. "If one 
neighbor is having problems, this affects the other neighbor, if 
it is happy, the other is also happy," stated the guests from 
Dagestan. They pointed out that they have always viewed Georgia 
as a conscientious and peace-loving neighbor. Therefore, no 
matter what pain is caused to one another by individual 
excesses, this cannot change the goodwill between our two 
nations that has become ingrained over the centuries. Batoni 
[Georgian polite form of address] Eduard Shevardnadze spoke at 
the meeting about mutual support between neighboring republics, 
which has such importance today during what is a difficult time 
for all. He emphasized the necessity of emerging from the 
crisis through joint efforts and by means of restoring old 
contacts and creating new ones. Dagestan could play one of the 
decisive roles in the Caucasus, particularly in that big issue 
that is called the "Caucasian dialogue," added the head of state 
at the end of the meeting.

  [Text] Abkhazia's Premier Sokrat Jinjolia has declared that 
only a UN peace mission can resolve the conflict with Georgia 
and guarantee a lasting peace. 
  Asked by Interfax to comment on UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's statement that peace-keepers can't be sent to 
Abkhazia now because of unsuitable conditions there, Jinjolia 
noted that "there have always been conditions for a UN 
peace-keeping mission." 
  In his words, Abkhazia's leadership adheres to a document 
signed in Geneva on January 13 at the end of the second round of 
Abkhazi-Georgian talks, envisaging the deployment of 
peace-keepers on the border between Abkhazia and Georgia along 
the Inguri river. 
  Last month Georgia changed its mind and called for 
positioning peace-keepers in Abkhazia, something that the 
Georgian leader Shevardnadze insisted on during his visit to 
U.S. earlier this month and in his speech at the United Nations. 
Meanwhile, the Abkhazi Parliament's Chairman Vladislav Ardzinba 
has declared that the introduction of peace-keepers in Abkhazia 
without its authorities' consent will be condemned as "an 
occupation with all the ensuing implications."

<F P=106> [Report by Tengiz Pachkoria: "They Have Declared Quarantine </F>
in Gali Rayon"] 
  [Text] Information is being received from various official 
and unofficial sources according to which Abkhazian separatists 
have sharply restricted the movement of the civilian population 
within Gali rayon and have also, to all intents and purposes, 
reduced to a minimum contact between relatives and neighbors in 
Gali rayon who are located on different sides of the Inguri 
River. After all, the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants 
of Gali rayon, fearing atrocities and robberies by Abkhazian and 
north Caucasian fighters, have been forced to leave their 
birthplaces and find temporary shelter in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, 
and other rayons in western Georgia. A certain number of their 
relatives still remain in Gali rayon. 
  The Abkhazian authorities have now virtually forbidden such 
movement. The formal reason given for this is the introduction 
of a quarantine on the territory of Gali rayon. Its period of 
duration is from 10 until 20 March. 
  In addition, during the last few days, Abkhazian and North 
Caucasian fighters stationed at the Inguri River have been 
sporadically opening fire with automatic weapons; they have been 
firing either into the air or in the direction of those villages 
in Zugdidi rayon that are located on the Inguri River. These 
acts of provocation, apart from anything else, are probably 
aimed at exerting psychological pressure on the inhabitants of 
the villages in Zugdidi rayon and the refugees there from the 
Abkhazian region.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Sarishvili: "Have Breakfast or a </F>
Shave?"] 
  [Text] The next morning I had one last mug of water left. 
Running a hand over my chin I decided that I still looked 
respectable and I would be allowed into parliament. So I used 
the water to boil an egg for breakfast. And I decided to have a 
wash and clean my shoes in parliament. 
  That day was perhaps the last in the chain of the 
unprecedented energy crisis, at least for the people of Tbilisi. 
As Eduard Shevardnadze said, the entire government together 
with the head of state is now performing the functions of a 
controller in order somehow to keep the situation under control. 
  I asked deputies Tengiz Sigua and Irina Sarishvili the 
strange but urgent question of who is to blame for the fact that 
I had to go to parliament unshaven. Sigua did not stop to think 
for a second: "The Georgian national bank. Over the first 10 
months of 1992 the former leadership of the national bank issued 
credits to the sum of $400 million. Whereas in the previous 
heating season the country consumed 38-40 million kilowatt-hours 
of electricity using procured fuel oil and energy resources 
while its need was for 48-50 million, this year it consumed 
nearly half as much. Why? Because the commodities with which we 
were to pay for the deliveries of fuel have been purchased with 
these credits and exported beyond the republic and, turning into 
rubles and dollars, have settled in foreign banks. Only 8 
percent of the credits issued were used to help the country. As 
a result Georgia is on famine rations as far as energy is 
concerned." 
  In the opinion of Irina Sarishvili the situation has been 
aggravated by the sale of energy resources to Armenia. I would 
call this not political but purely parasitical sabotage," 
Sarishvili said. "But it is hard to find someone here who will 
say anything directly. The facts? There are no facts in this 
state. They turn off your light, then you pay money and they 
turn it on." 
  What way out of the overall crisis can I see? The government 
program built on slogans will provide nothing although that 
program, Shevardnadze's program, and other programs contain many 
theoretically correct recommendations. We must have a 
government in which the people the people will have a sense of 
political trust so that people do not think they are being 
misled and robbed. Then it will be possible to speak of the 
inception of trends toward improving the situation."

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent on President Geydar </F>
Aliyev's meeting with NATO representatives in Baku on 21 Mar] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Tugay 
Ozseri, Turkey's ambassador to NATO, was heading the delegation. 
The actual aim of this delegation was to ensure Azerbaijan's 
participation in the international Partnership for Peace program 
and in the military and political consultations. 
  Republic President Geydar Aliyev told the guests that the 
meeting will be useful, and added that this visit to Baku by a 
high-ranking delegation shows NATO's enormous interest in 
Azerbaijan, and that we will try to carefully listen to your 
views and proposals and discuss them in a spirit of cooperation. 
  Tugay Ozseri said that NATO adopted the Partnership for 
Peace 
program at the beginning of the year and that any country could 
freely become a member of NATO's new structure within the 
framework of this program. So far Ukraine, Moldova, the Czech 
and Slovak Republics, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, 
Albania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have signed this 
agreement. It is expected that Russia and Georgia will also 
join NATO's new program. 
  But, as a country waging a war, what will Azerbaijan expect 
or gain from the endorsement of this plan? 
  The head of the delegation and its members gave an 
unequivocal reply to this question, which was of interest to all 
those present at the meeting. The military alliance that they 
represent favors the defense of the territorial integrity of any 
independent state, it only holds military and political 
consultations and acts as a mediator in providing humanitarian 
assistance. 
  Geydar Aliyev reiterated that NATO's new structure is of 
enormous importance for Azerbaijan, and this is how he expressed 
his views on the subject: 
  [Aliyev] We know about NATO's appeal to the independent 
states, which were members of the former Warsaw Pact and Soviet 
Union, and its decision to accept their response. We want to 
clarify certain matters and establish our Republic's final 
position regarding this decision. 
  Undoubtedly, we welcome as very positive the declaration of 
the Partnership for Peace established within such a major 
organization as NATO. That is, we regard it as being very 
positive. This program is probably more important and urgent 
for our Republic than it is for the other countries that have 
joined it. This is because, as you know, Azerbaijan is in a war 
with Armenia. You yourselves indicated that 20 percent of 
Azerbaijani lands are under the occupation of the Armenian Armed 
Forces. The war is still continuing. Therefore, I reiterate 
that the enlistment in the program put forward by NATO, which is 
one of the most respected and prestigious international 
organizations, is very important in solving our problems. 
  Therefore, in joining this program it must be clear what 
Azerbaijan will gain. You noted that the benefits primarily 
rest in the fact that we will be in this organization, that is, 
we will have our representatives in this organization, that it 
will be possible to hold political consultations with this 
organization, and that certain problems might be taken into 
consideration in the bilateral agreement that will follow the 
signing of this program. We are interested in seeing the 
emergence of such possibilities for Azerbaijan, and we will 
appraise them. However, our demands go beyond these 
possibilities. And such demands are only natural, because as I 
noted we are in a war and our lands are under occupation. It 
will be inappropriate not only for Azerbaijan but also for NATO 
if we fail to solve this problem despite being, if not fully, 
almost a member of this most powerful military and political 
organization in the world. It is obvious that since its 
establishment, there has been no military conflict or discord 
between NATO countries. This is only natural, and that is how 
it should be, because countries that are members of a major 
political and military alliance cannot fight amongst themselves. 
But unfortunately, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia 
started when they were still two republics within a single 
Soviet state, let alone a mere alliance. The state failed to 
prevent this conflict. Now, Azerbaijan is a member of the newly 
formed CIS, you know this. Armenia was a member of CIS from the 
day of its inception. Could you imagine that despite being 
members of this union and having signed a collective security 
treaty within this union, the two states are at war? I declared 
during the Ashgabat meeting of the CIS heads of state on 24 
December 1993 that such a situation is abnormal, and I requested 
that the states signatory to the collective security treaty come 
together and look into this matter. However, no positive result 
has been achieved. It could be that the CIS is still young and 
has little experience. Whereas, such a major organization as 
NATO established in 1949 has accumulated enormous experience, 
and maybe it can find an opportunity to help us after we join 
this Partnership for Peace program. 
  We invited you here to clarify these matters, and I would 
have wished that regarding these matters you [changes thought]. 
I know that it is not possible to deviate from certain 
long-established principles of this organization, but a new 
program has now been drawn up. You said that 12 states have 
already signed this program. But, they probably do not have such 
a problem, whereas we do. Armenia also has such a problem. 
However, Armenia might approach this problem from a different 
angle, because its aggressiveness is obvious; it is the 
aggressor, and is occupying another state's territory. Whereas, 
we are victims of an aggression. In drawing your attention to 
these matters, I want to reiterate that we consider the 
Partnership for Peace program as being very useful. We, too, 
want to sign and became partners in this program. However, in 
view of present conditions in our Republic, we consider it 
important to clarify certain matters. In this connection, you 
already noted that our foreign minister has spoken to you about 
military budget and other matters. I hope that our ties in this 
direction will continue, and I hope that we will arrive at a 
consensus. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Republic Foreign Minister Gasan 
Gasanov, Turkish Ambassador to Azerbaijan Altan Karamanoglu, and 
State Adviser Vafa Gulizade also participated in the meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Koretskiy: "Russia in Settling of </F>
Conflicts. Moscow's Peacekeeping Efforts: Useless Fuss"] 
  [Text] The resumption of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh late 
last week once again brought to naught Russia's peacekeeping 
efforts. Neither did the participants in the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly manage to make their contribution to 
the normalization of the situation, as they failed to persuade 
Azerbaijan's representatives to soften their demands on the 
withdrawal of the Armenian troops as a necessary condition for 
the resumption of dialogue with the Armenians. As for Geydar 
Aliyev's statements made on national television on Sunday, they 
generally put in doubt chances for the sides' reconciliation. 
  Having termed the combat operations by the Azerbaijan Army 
as 
just and liberating, Aliyev actually called upon his fellow 
countrymen for war till victory -- until "Armenia's troops of 
occupation leave all the occupied lands." Diplomatic efforts, 
including those of Moscow, in his opinion, should be aimed at 
achieving this goal. 
  The main points of Aliyev's Sunday address were repeated 
later in the day, in his own interpretation, by Ara Saakyan, 
first deputy chairman of the Armenian parliament. He stressed 
that normalization was possible only if fighting stops and 
Karabakh's legal status is determined. Without this, in his 
opinion, it is senseless to speak about any separation of the 
opposing sides. Saakyan simultaneously stated Yerevan's 
intention to turn for help in the settlement of the conflict to 
states of Europe and the United States, which attests to the 
fact that the idea of internationalizing the conflict is 
increasingly gaining popularity in the capitals of the opposing 
sides.

  [Text] A communique from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense 
Press Service has said that the enemy has tried to attack our 
positions around (Ashagy) from Korgan, which is an occupied 
town. Our fighters have retaliated and obstructed the enemy's 
advance. Some 20 Armenian troops have been killed. 
  The situation in Agdamskiy Rayon is tense. The enemy has 
leveled heavy fire on Zangishaly, (Kemendil), and Kyn-Kyshlak in 
that region. Meanwhile, our fighters' positions around the Omar 
Pass have been shelled with artillery guns. 
  The situation on the other parts of the front line is 
relatively peaceful at the present time.

  [Text] As an Azerbaijani defense ministry spokesman told 
Interfax, Armenian troops launched an offensive toward the 
village of Alkhanly, Fizuli region, Azerbaijan at 8 am Tuesday. 
Many armored vehicles are said to be involved in the offensive. 
Fighting on this section of the front continues. 
  On Monday, Armenian forces reportedly tried to break through 
to the strategic Goradiz rail junction near the 
Azerbaijani-Armenian frontier but were forced back to where they 
had come from. By reports from Baku, two Karabakh army trucks 
with servicemen have been destroyed. 
  Meanwhile, Azerbaijani forces have come under mortar fire in 
the Agdam and Ter-Tersk areas. There has been no reports from

  [Text] During the series of talks held last week in 
Chisinau and Tiraspol, Vladem Vasev, special representative of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in charge of eliminating dissent 
in the eastern rayons of the Republic of Moldova, handed over to 
authorities in Chisinau and the self-proclaimed Dniester 
Republic the proposals of the leadership of the Russian 
Federation intended to politically settle the conflict. 
  According to our Chisinau correspondent citing ITAR-TASS 
agency, the Moscow proposals stipulate the establishment of a 
special Dniester region with an own executive power, an elected 
assembly, and a court of justice. The special region is to be 
an inalienable part of the Republic of Moldova, but it will 
bestowed with an important degree of self-administration. 
  The document also stipulates that in case the Republic of 
Moldova decides to renounce its statehood and unite with another 
country, the Dniester region is to be granted the right to 
self-determination.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Gamova: "Russian Mediators Suggest </F>
Kishinev Give Dniester Region Broad Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] -- Kishinev and Tiraspol are 
prepared to put on the negotiations table counterdrafts of 
documents on the future of the Dniester Region. Vladlen Vasev, 
the Russian president's official representative, has come to 
Moldova with a package of proposals on this question: Russia 
will take part in the talks as a mediator. 
  Although each delegation has its own documents prepared, 
they 
are in no hurry to make them public. All that is known is that 
the CSCE recommendations will be put at the basis of the talks 
to determine the political status of Moldavia's [Moldova's] 
Eastern regions. Kishinev, according to President Mirchi 
Snegur, is prepared to grant the Dniester Region "broad powers" 
but people there, at least at the level of official statements, 
still agree only to confederation. 
  Vladlen Vasev, answering an IZVESTIYA correspondent's 
question about what specifically the Russian side had brought to 
the talks, noted that the content of the documents he had 
brought with him comes down to the idea of "broad autonomy" for 
the Dniester Region within the framework of a single state. 
  In the CSCE recommendations one can discern the "Crimean 
option" for resolving the Dniester conflict. Kishinev rejects 
this option because it fears separatist movements and the 
region's withdrawal from the state. Promising to include in the 
future law on the status of the Dniester Region guarantees in 
the event of the republic's loss of its statehood, official 
Kishinev believes that is enough. Actually, the Dniester Region 
authorities are also manipulating the people's opinion, citing 
the results of a referendum in favor of their own statehood. 
  Both sides hope to benefit from Russia's mediation. The 
Dniester Region is sure that Russia's participation in the talks 
is a guarantee that the region's interests will be protected. 
Moldavia is counting on using the Russian side's aid to push 
Tiraspol toward compromise.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 22/3/1994 -- The efforts used 
to persuade the South [area inhabited by the Gagauz ethnic 
minority] to take part in the [27 February parliamentary] 
elections in exchange for the solution of the Gagauz problem has 
unpleasant consequences for Chisinau's official policy, states 
reporter Val Butnaru in a political commentary in weekly 
OBSERVATORUL DE CHISINAU (CHISINAU OBSERVER.) Given that [Prime 
Minister Nicolae] Sangheli and [Agrarian Democratic Party of 
Moldova Chairman Dimitru] Motpan have encouraged the elections 
in the South, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM] 
now has to pay some electoral bills. A last week appeal of 
Comrat [capital of the Gagauz region] to the Chisinau Parliament 
says that 85.4 percent of the electors in Gagauz regions "have 
pleaded for the development of the Gaguz Republic as a 
national-territorial formation within the Republic of Moldova." 
Comrat hopes that "representatives of the PDAM and of the Block 
of the Socialist Party and the Unitate-Edinstvo Movement, which 
has the majority in the new parliament, as well as the 17 March 
official declarations made by [Moldovan President] Mircea Snegur 
and Andrei Sangheli will ease the solution of the problem of the 
self-determination of regions mostly inhabited by the Gagauz." 
The session of the Gagauz Parliament adopted on 14 March a 
declaration that opts for the "recognition of the Gagauz 
Republic as a national-territorial formation as compound of 
Moldova, and the legalization in the new [Moldovan] Constitution 
of the principle of the republic's federalization." Snegur had 
repeatedly opposed this principle. One of the PDAM leaders, 
Aurel Talmaci, declared that the agrarians will only support the 
idea of a special status for the southern regions. Petru 
Lucinschi [speaker of Moldova's Parliament] declared before the 
elections that "we should not be afraid of the word 
`federalization,' as it does not mean yet the republic's 
dismemberment." The opposition does not feel responsible for 
the solution of the Gaguz problem. It considers 
anti-constitutional the inclusion of the supplementary question 
about the Gagauz' statehood into the bulletins of the 6 March 
poll.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 22/3/1994 -- At this moment all 
Russian forces, from Yeltsin to Zhirinovskiy, have met on the 
same anti-Western platform, states the journalist Petru Bogatu 
in the weekly TARA (THE COUNTRY.) The Kremlin is frankly 
claiming its sphere of influence in eastern and central Europe, 
where Russians think that Washington has nothing to do. Under 
such circumstances, the Chisinau officials plead for neutrality; 
this gesture is equivalent to "an act of national suicide," the 
quoted source asserts. President Snegur signs the adherence to 
the NATO program Partnership for Peace, and then tells Moscow, 
Tiraspol, and Comrat that this "will not make the Republic of 
Moldova orient itself toward the West and that it will remain a 
neutral state." The adherence to the Partnership for Peace 
requests the abandoning of the neutral policy in the prospect of 
gradual integration in European military structures. The 
Romanian space has always sought a support in the West, and when 
it could not find one, it had losses: An example is the loss of 
Bessarabia and Transylvania by [Romania's King] Carol II in 
1940. In the situation when both sides want the expansion of 
their territory of influence, "our incorporation into the free 
world" is mandatory. Otherwise, the present state of this 
territory will degenerate in a free fall into the chasm of 
history, the author believes.

Tratsevskiy] 
  [Text] Minsk March 23 TASS -- Official talks between the 
defence ministers of the United States and the Belarus Republic 
began here today. The U.S. secretary of defence arrived in the 
Belarus capital today. His negotiations with Colonel-General 
Pavel Kazlowski are proceeding behind closed doors. 
  "One of the main subjects that will be discussed during the 
meeting is American aid to solve Belarusian conversion 
problems," First Deputy Defence Minister of the Belarus Republic 
Aleksandr Tushinskiy told BELINFORM. Tushinskiy is a prominent 
electronics specialist and first civilian appointed to the 
leadership of the republic's Defence Ministry. He is charged 
with the task of switching the defence industry to civilian 
rails. 
  Tushinskiy said that Perry is expected to announce some 
Belarus- American conversion programmes, covering such 
Belarusian defence enterprises as "Belomo" and "Intergral." As 
a result of a tough contest carried out in the United States, 
several American partner firms have been selected for them, 
whose technologies, know-how and other parameters coincide with 
those of the Minsk plants. "During the American secretary's 
visit," Tushinskiy said, "we expect to sign a joint statement on 
the principles that will underlie the work of the 
Belarus-American conversion committee. An organisational 
meeting of this body will also be held." 
  Tushinskiy stressed that this committee was set up as a 
result of previous Belarus-American meetings at top level and 
after repeated consultations between expert delegations of the 
two countries. 
  The final results of the talks will become known today 
afternoon during a press conference that will be held here 
jointly by the U.S. secretary of defence and the Belarus defence 
minister.

  Under the ordinance, more that 12 percent of all central 
executive personnel will be made redundant as of May 20. This 
ordinance does not apply to the Foreign, Justice, Natural

<F P=106> [Interview with Valeriy Tikhinya, leader of the People's </F>
Movement of Belarus parliamentary faction, by Igor Gukovskiy; 
place and date not given: "We Need Social Guarantees, Union 
With Russia, and Yuriy Andropov as President" -- first paragraph 
is RESPUBLIKA introduction.] 
  [Excerpts] Valeriy Tikhinya is a famous person in Belarus. 
He was once a minister of justice and a secretary of the 
Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central Committee. He is one 
of those few people who remain faithful to their beliefs, 
despite all transitory trends. Currently, Valeriy Guryevich 
heads the People's Movement of Belarus [NDB] Supreme Soviet 
faction. He has recently met with a RESPUBLIKA correspondent. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Gukovskiy]You are the leader of the NDB's deputy 
faction. How do you, and your colleagues, assess the current 
political and economic situation in Belarus? 
  [Tikhinya] Serious changes have recently taken place -- 
society has become more leftist. Left-centrist forces have 
consolidated under the NDB's roof. The Belarusian Popular Front 
[BNF], which is rapidly losing people's confidence, is 
agonizing. This was confirmed by the events that took place in 
February -- the failed attempt to turn society upside-down. The 
tide of nationalist frenzy is seceding. 
  Complex and contradictory processes are under way in the 
Belarusian economy which, in my opinion, is inertly falling, but 
has not yet hit bottom, and I doubt it will do so this year. 
Over the last two years, the GDP has fallen by more than 20 
percent, which has been an unprecedented decline. The 
Belarusian economy could not endure senseless experiments, and 
as a result, Belarus has joined the undeveloped countries of the 
world. 
  The social gap continues to widen -- the poor are getting 
poorer and the rich are getting richer. According to the 
Institute of Sociology Data, two thirds of Belarusian citizens 
currently live on the brink of poverty. Biological survival has 
become the main problem for many people.... 
  [Gukovskiy]What do you propose? 
  [Tikhinya] To start with, the entire path we have gone 
through should be analyzed, and our ailing economy should be 
diagnosed. After that, a program for overcoming the crisis 
should be worked out. Today, we resemble a passenger of a 
train, the engineer of which does not know where he is going. 
  [Gukovskiy]When did the engineer lose touch with 
reality? 
  [Tikhinya] At the first stage of Gorbachev's so-called 
perestroyka, approximately at the end of 1990. As Goethe said, 
we admitted that the idea was useful, but we failed to wisely 
implement it. Although we accepted the idea of market economy, 
we have not managed to put it into practice so far. 
  There should be a comprehensive concept of action for 
implementing market reforms. We should proceed toward the 
market economy on an evolutionary path, beginning with the 
sector of economy that is prepared most adequately for this. In 
this regard, I totally support the Kebich government, despite 
the fact that it sometimes fails to consistently proceed on this 
path. Gaydarization and shock therapy are not for us. 
  Our economic course should be thoroughly corrected. I am not 
speaking about this accidentally. Addressing the Supreme Soviet 
session after his election, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw 
Hryb stated that Belarus' course, including implementation of 
economic reforms, had not been changed. I cannot agree with 
this. Reforms that lead the people toward impoverishment are 
worth nothing, and it is evident that the people are being 
robbed. I have in mind not only the "burnt" savings in the 
Saving Bank. During the tenure of [former Supreme Soviet 
Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich, social guarantees, which had 
been won in preceding years, were systematically and gradually 
liquidated. 
  I believe that there are at least three preconditions for 
coming out of the crisis: overcoming the powerlessness of 
authorities, joining an economic union with Russia, and mounting 
the battle against crime. 
  [Gukovskiy]Where, in your opinion, does the 
powerlessness of authorities lie -- in its insufficient powers 
or low professional skills? 
  [Tikhinya] Until recently, the main reason lay in the lack 
of powers. The parliament, however, has recently granted 
additional powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, the 
personnel issue has now come into prominence. [Prime Minister] 
Vyacheslav Kebich's attempts to reorganize the government 
deserve approval. 
  The second necessary precondition, as I have already said, 
is 
an economic union with Russia. We need it, as we need air, and 
the establishment of a common ruble zone should be the first 
step in this direction. 
  The third precondition for overcoming the crisis is the 
battle against crime. Corrupted Mafia rings have infiltrated 
state structures, which was vividly confirmed by the evidence 
collected by the committee headed by Deputy Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka. This comes as no surprise, since there still is no 
state program for combating crime. 
  Crimes against property currently amount to 75 percent of 
all 
felonies. When I was the attorney of the Minsk Leninskiy rayon, 
this figure did not exceed 25 percent. However, this is not 
strange at all, given the out-of-control price hikes. A man is 
tempted into committing a crime if he has nothing to eat, even 
under the threat of harsh punishment. Improvement of the 
situation depends on how quickly can we improve the economic 
situation. 
  [Gukovskiy]The NDB is composed of various parties and 
organizations, in terms of their viewpoint on the future 
economic development of Belarus. I understand that an accord is 
possible in politics to achieve common goals and tasks at a 
certain stage. How, however, is the NDB going to work out a 
common economic program? Are you going to create a hybrid made 
of contradictory economic viewpoints? Will it not lead to an 
even more abnormal and abominable experiment? 
  [Tikhinya] The NDB will discuss its economic program at its 
next congress, which will probably be held after the economic 
union with Russia is concluded. I hope that we will not have to 
wait too long. There will be no hybrid. We will collectively 
discuss a draft program on which our specialists have already 
begun to work. I believe that it will be based on the 
communists' program. In general, all organizations forming the 
NDB agree that the people should be returned what they have been 
deprived of, and that we should build a welfare economy. This 
conforms to a constitutional provision on building a welfare 
state. 
  [Gukovskiy]The deputies' corps voted for introducing 
the presidential office in Belarus. Shortly before that, NDB 
leader Syarhey Haydukevich had stated in an interview with our 
paper that the movement is for a parliamentary republic. Did 
the NDB have not enough votes to block the parliament's 
decision, or did you simply change your mind at the last 
moment? 
  [Tikhinya] We are indeed able to block any decision 
requiring a constitutional majority. Having analyzed this issue 
on the eve of voting, the majority of us finally decided to vote 
for introducing presidency. Although I conformed to the 
majority, I still believe that we have not taken advantage of 
all possibilities of a parliamentary republic. On the other 
hand, given the current disorder, the introduction of the 
presidency can become the effective means of strengthening the 
executive branch that we have spoken of. It should be kept in 
mind, however, that the presidency can also lead Belarus to an 
authoritarian rule. Therefore, following the introduction of 
this office, we should immediately work out a whole range of 
limits and counterweights. We should, for example, stipulate 
that the president is not entitled to dissolve the Supreme 
Soviet, etc. 
  [Gukovskiy] What sort of a man, in your opinion, 
should the Belarusian president be? 
  [Tikhinya] Speaking about a political leader, it should be 
somebody like Petr Masherov [former first secretary of the KPB]. 
Speaking about a state leader, I would name Yuriy Andropov 
[former first secretary of the CPSU] -- Belarus needs exactly 
this sort of a man today. 
  [Gukovskiy]What can you say about chances of specific 
politicians in the presidential elections? Whom will the NDB 
field or support? 
  [Tikhinya] Our coordinative committee has not yet discussed 
this issue. I, personally, believe that either Lukashenka or 
Kebich can become candidates of left-wing forces' bloc. Perhaps 
other people will appear. The right wing, in my opinion, will 
present as its candidates Karpenko [leader of the Party of 
People's Accord], Shushkevich, Tarazevich, and, probably, [BNF 
leader] Paznyak; the latter, however, has rather poor chances, 
as a very loathsome individual. 
  [Gukovskiy]How did Tarazevich, former Supreme Soviet 
chairman of the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic, end up on 
the right flank? 
  [Tikhinya] It is hard for me to answer this question. I 
only admit the fact. 
  [Gukovskiy]Are you going to run for the presidency? 
  [Tikhinya] According to the draft legislation on 
presidential elections, either 70 votes of people's deputies or 
100,000 signatures of voters is required to register a 
candidate. The NDB will try to present only one candidate. If 
my candidacy is put forward, I will run. Today, all I can say 
is that I will run for a parliamentary seat.

Belarusian aviation repair facilities and related aeronautical 
enterprises. However, there was no mention of a concrete 
schedule as to when this attractive project may actually be 
fulfilled.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 22, BNS -- Presidents Lennart Meri of 
Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and Algirdas Brazauskas of 
Lithuania are scheduled to meet in the Lithuanian seaside resort 
of Palanga Friday [25 March]. 
  The program of the summit is not fully prepared yet but the 
Lithuanian President's Office said the meeting will start with 
lunch at 1 p.m. 
  Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy 
adviser, told the state-run ELTA news agency that the three 
presidents intend to discuss priorities in the foreign policy of 
the Baltic states. In Paleckis' words, cooperation between the 
three Baltic nations, integration with Western Europe and 
relations with neighboring countries will be the central issues 
during the meeting. 
  The presidential adviser said the Baltic states are now able 
to coordinate their positions much easier than a year ago. 
Paleckis said the only slight disagreements concern free trade 
agreements with the European Union [EU]. Lithuania and Latvia 
intend to sign the so-called asymmetrical agreements which 
restrict the import of some goods, while Estonia wants to 
completely liberalize trade with the EU.

  [Text] Estonian Premier Mart Laar believes that Estonia 
does not need the mediation of third states during settlement of 
the issue of Russian troop withdrawal. 
  Speaking at a press conference in Tallinn on Tuesday, 
Estonian Premier Laar disapproved of the proposals that the 
problem be resolved under mediation by other states put forward 
by some Estonian politicians. However, he suggested that 
international mediation might be useful when resolving the issue 
on the borders with Russia which had reached a deadlock. 
  Estonia does not recognize the unification of several 
regions 
which belonged to Estonia under the Russian-Estonian treaty of 
1920 but then were joined to Russia in 1944-1945. 
  Commenting on the coming round of the Estonian-Russian 
negotiations on April 5-6, Estonian Premier Laar stated that 
Estonia would make no concessions on the issue concerning 
residence permit for Russian retired servicemen living in 
Estonia. 
  "We will act in accordance with our legislation and we are 
not going to change it," Estonian Premier Laar emphasized. 
However, he believes that the treaty on the Russian troops' 
withdrawal will be signed at the next round of the negotiations 
despite the fact that Russia conditions this issue with the one 
on retired servicemen. 
  There are about 2,500 Russian servicemen remaining in 
Estonia 
who are expected to be withdrawn by August 31, 1994.

  [Excerpt] [Announcer Aleksandr Sapozhnikov] [passage 
omitted] Several different versions of what happened to the 
plane have already emerged. According to Yuriy Korenevskiy, 
deputy head of the air transport department of Russia's 
Transport Ministry, the plane's abrupt fall and crash could only 
have been caused by instantaneous decompression of the interior, 
caused by an explosion aboard the aircraft or collision with 
another object. However, Korenevskiy said that the 
professionalism and training of the A-310 crew is not in any 
doubt. 
  Yuriy Vorobyev, first deputy minister for emergencies, said 
literally the following: The plane crash in Siberia happened 
suddenly. The crew did not transmit an SOS. So, the 
possibility of an act of terrorism cannot be ruled out.

  [Text] On March 9, 1994, Georgs Andrejevs, Minister of 
Foreign Affairs of Latvia, received a letter from US Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher. 
  Mr. Christopher reiterated US support for the withdrawal of 
Russian troops from Latvia by August 31, 1994 at the latest. 
The Secretary of State also expressed his understanding of 
Latvia's painful problems resulting from 50 years of occupation. 
  In his letter, Mr. Christopher touched on issues concerning 
the Skrunda early-warning radar installation, and confirmed that 
the US is exploring the possibility of financial assistance for 
its dismantling. 
  Mr. Christopher noted that he is well informed about and 
understand the issues related to Latvia's citizenship law. He 
also expressed the hope that the Latvian government will find a 
politically and morally judicious resolution to this problem. 
  In relation to the solution of fundamental security issues 
for Latvia, of special merit Mr. Christopher noted the visit to 
the US by the delegation from Latvia's Saeima [parliament]. 
  At the end of his letter, the US Secretary of State once 
again confirmed America's favourable disposition towards and 
support of Latvia.

  [Text] Moscow, March 21 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata reiterated on Monday [21 March] he was "gravely 
concerned" over the issue of North Korea's suspected development 
of nuclear weapons. 
  At a press conference in Moscow prior to his departure to 
Tokyo, Hata requested North Korea to accept full inspections of 
its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA). 
  He said he was "gravely concerned" that the IAEA could not 
confirm North Korea was not converting nuclear material for 
military use. 
  In Vienna, the IAEA adopted a resolution on Monday to refer 
North Korea's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear 
facilities to the United Nations Security Council. 
  Hata also said if the United Nations decides any sanctions 
against North Korea, Japan would like "to take a responsible 
action as a nation which regards the UN as most important."

  [Text] New and energetic steps toward a market economy will 
be made this year in Ukraine. This is the essence of several 
measures adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers. They are directed 
at fulfilling the state program for demonopolizing the economy 
and developing overall competence which was already drafted by 
the legislature. The legal basis of the aforementioned 
processes will be upgraded by adopting new normative acts. Each 
branch and region will receive a complex program of market 
changes. Other measures address the issues of providing the 
information, personnel, and other facilities necessary for the 
implementation of this program.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk is satisfied that the 
defense ministers of Ukraine and USA during recent talks 
"reached common positions on most issues which today can be 
resolved," Kravchuk said at a meeting with Pentagon Chief 
Willian Perry on Monday. 
  Kravchuk also said: "There are issues which cannot be 
resolved today, but gradually they can be resolved if there is 
willingness to do so." 
  On the same day the defense ministers of the two countries 
Vitaly Radetsky and William Perry signed an agreement on 
additional US aid to Ukraine for the liquidation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  As Perry told journalists after the signing ceremony, 
Ukraine 
will be given an additional $50 million for the dismantling of 
nuclear arms. In December last year the USA granted $135 
million to Ukraine for that purpose. 
  Noting that cooperation between the two countries is very 
important in the strategical aspect, Perry stressed the 
particular significance of interaction between the military 
ministries of Ukraine and the USA. 
  Perry said that an agreement was also reached on "frequent 
and close" ties between the general headquarters and leaders of 
the military ministries of the two countries. 
  Radetsky called the fact that with the US and Russian help 
Ukraine managed to get out of a nuclear stalemate and sign a 
trilateral Moscow statement on the liquidation of nuclear 
weapons on its territory "a historic step." He said all 
obstacles to Ukraine's joining the treaty on non-proliferation 
of nuclear weapons had been eliminated. 
  Radetsky pointed out that developing cooperation between 
Ukraine and the USA promotes both global and regional security. 
  At a meeting on the same day Perry and Ukrainian 
Vice-Premier 
Valery Shamrov decided to charge experts with preparing an 
agreement or a communique which would reflect a common position 
of Ukraine and the USA on nuclear disarmament and cooperation in 
the space and rocket field. 
  Chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary commission on 
defense 
and state security issues Valentin Lemish told journalists that 
probably a bilateral commission will be formed to control the 
disarmament process in Ukraine.

<F P=106> ["Text" of President Geydar Aliyev's Novruz Message on 20 </F>
March--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed fellow countrymen, sisters, and 
brothers; I congratulate all the people and citizens of 
Azerbaijan on the occasion of Novruz. Novruz is the spring 
festival. We have begun to mark this occasion after many years. 
It indicates significant developments in the world. 
  Azerbaijan's people have achieved their freedom. Azerbaijan 
is an independent republic. It has been recognized by the 
United Nations and it has taken the place it deserves in that 
organization. Novruz, which we have always marked, is [words 
indistinct]. 
  Meanwhile, we are celebrating Novruz in the middle of a 
serious political situation. The Armenian Armed Forces have 
attacked our Republic. Consequently, a large part of Azerbaijan 
has been occupied. More than 1 million citizens have been 
forced to leave their homes and become refugees. Our people are 
prepared to fight to defend their homeland and its territory. 
Our heroic sons and fighters have been martyred in violent 
clashes while defending our homeland. On the eve of Novruz, I 
wish to bow my head and remember our martyrs. I also wish to 
assure our people that we shall always cherish the memory of our 
martyrs. 
  A regrettable incident occurred in Baku yesterday. An 
explosion destroyed a subway passenger car. Several passengers 
were either killed or wounded. I convey my condolences to their 
families. It seems that [words indistinct]. 
  Meanwhile, the war is continuing. We are fighting to 
liberate our territory. Our Armed Forces continue to retaliate 
against the enemy attacks. They are taking measures to defend 
our homeland. The fighting is of a frontal nature. Our people 
have arisen to evict the enemy from their homeland. [passage 
omitted] 
  The war has created a tragic situation for Azerbaijan's 
people. More than 1 million citizens have been living under 
difficult conditions. [passage indistinct] 
  I wish to ask our citizens, who have been forced to live 
under miserable conditions after leaving their homes and 
property, to be patient. They must rest assured that Azerbaijan 
will definitely emerge from this state of affairs and that they 
will return to their homes and places of birth. [passage on 
Aliyev's reference to the importance of women and mothers and 
Azerbaijanis living abroad omitted] 
  Azerbaijan has many important problems. However, the most 
important of all is to create the conditions required to end the 
war, maintain Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, establish 
peace and tranquillity for the people, and enable each and every 
citizen to benefit from the gains of our freedom and 
independence. We regard those objectives as an obligation that 
we have tried to fulfill and we will continue to do so. The 
most urgent task is to end the war and maintain Azerbaijan's 
independence. Our problems are common knowledge. We are trying 
to [words indistinct]. The initiatives we have made in that 
direction are common knowledge. The Armenian Armed Forces must 
withdraw from the occupied territories. They must be removed 
from Azerbaijan's territory and Azerbaijan's territorial 
integrity must be maintained. We are holding talks on the basis 
of those principles. We shall maintain the talks. The 
negotiations will be held on the basis of the maintenance of 
Azerbaijan's independence and its territorial integrity. I hope 
that something will be achieved. The work carried out by the 
international organizations and influential countries is very 
important for us. We shall try to [words indistinct]. 
  The Azerbaijan Armed Forces are [words indistinct] in the 
defense of the Republic's territory. Everyone must rest assured 
that we shall continue to work to strengthen the military forces 
to guarantee Azerbaijan's independence and territorial 
integrity. [passage indistinct] 
  If [words indistinct] fail, Azerbaijan's people and military 
forces are capable of defending the homeland and maintaining its 
territorial integrity. We shall achieve that objective. Our 
people must rest assured that the grave situation will be 
removed and Azerbaijan's occupied territories will be taken 
back. They must rest assured that independent Azerbaijan will 
[words indistinct] in the UN organization and the Republic's 
people will achieve their objectives. Nothing can obstruct this 
achievement. We shall try to resolve all the economic [words 
indistinct] problems. We urge the Republic's people to work 
together in that direction. [passage indistinct] 
  I appeal to our people and to all the political parties in 
our society to unite to save our Republic and its people from 
the difficult situation. [passage indistinct] 
  I hope that the very beautiful nature of Novruz will 
strengthen the patriotic feeling and the spirit of unity in our 
people. I also hope that our people will not spare any effort 
in trying to improve the situation in the Republic. 
  I congratulate the Republic's citizens on the occasion of 
Novruz once again. Esteemed sisters and brothers, I pray for 
the happiness of each and every one of you. May you have 
success in your life and work and may your festival be 
auspicious. I wish you health and [words indistinct]. Thank 
you.

  [Text] Vladilen Vasev, a Russian presidential envoy on the 
Transdniester conflict met in Chisinau Monday with the head of 
the CSCE mission in Moldova Richard Samuels. Before that he had 
two days of meetings with the leaders of the self-proclaimed 
Transdniester republic in its capital Tiraspol. 
  The envoy refrained from comments on the results of his 
meetings. However, in an interview with Interfax he said 
consultations would resume in a matter of days. 
  According to Vasev, a time for pragmatism is beginning: Both 
Chisinau and Tiraspol realize that there is a political solution 
is the only way to settle the problem. [sentence as received] 
He said that Russia has its own interests there, in particular 
the protection of the rights of the Russian community, which is 
why it is ready to promote in every way the settlement of the 
conflict in the Dniester River valley so that political 
stability would finally be reached in Moldova.

  [Text] Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry 
arrived in Minsk on a one-day official visit. The businesslike 
relations of military partnership between the Republic of 
Belarus and the United States began to take shape in 1992. The 
first steps on this path were taken during the visit to the 
United States by Alyaksandr Tushynski, first deputy defense 
minister of the Republic of Belarus. By then, an agreement on 
dealing with the aftermath of an emergency situation and the 
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction was signed 
between our two countries. Belarusian and U.S. military 
specialists are discussing the relative directions of military 
cooperation, including such issues as conversion, control over 
the export of radioactive materials, the training of servicemen, 
and the creation of working groups to coordinate military 
cooperation. 
  William Perry was received today by Belarusian Defense 
Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy and Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich. Later in the day, the U.S. secretary of 
defense will visit the Belarusian Supreme Soviet. 
  It is planned that the visit will result in the signing of a 
joint agreement on the principles of a Belarusian-U.S. committee 
for conversion.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, March 24 -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper 
singles out materials on growing social stratification of 
society. Referring to official data, the newspaper notes that 
"20 per cent of well-to-do population enjoys now 40 per cent of 
all cash incomes while 20 per cent of population in the low wage 
bracket has only seven per cent". 
  "The society's `elite' has formed its closed circle isolated 
from the popular masses, working for itself and serving itself," 
the newspaper writes. Noting that such a situation is fraught 
with a social explosion, the newspaper calls for stepping up 
state and public control, using economic levers. 
  The same newspaper speaks about "an emerging course for 
stabilisation" in the country in another article, where premier 
Viktor Chernomyrdin is called its main herald. According to 
ROSSIISKIE VESTI, this course should not be rescribed as a 
rollback on reforms. It means "only a departure from radicalism 
to more organic development of society". 
  The TRUD, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and other newspapers single 
out a report on the land-crash of an A-310 plane belonging to 
the Russian International Airlines Company, which flew on the 
Moscow-hong kong route. All crew members, nine stewardesses and 
63 passengers died. 
  In the opinion of the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper, an 
explosion is a possible reason for the tragedy. The newspaper 
writes that circumstances of the plane's crash are very similar 
to those of the Boeing's crash in 1986 over Scotland blasted by 
international terrorists (notorious "Lockerbie case"). 
  The TRUD newspaper carries an interview with Russian 
Minister 
for Nationalities Sergey Shakhray who explains reasons 
motivating his faction (Party of Russian Unity and Accord) in 
the lower house to vote for the much publicised amnesty. "One 
cannot be a judge at his own house," he says. "The logic of 
civil clashes knows only one way out: an attempt for civil 
reconciliation." 
  The same newspaper features an interview with acting 
Ukrainian Premier Yefim Zvyagilsky, saying that some Western 
media fan up "a conflict" between Ukraine and Russia. "These are 
ravings of a madman," he stresses. "Some people are evidently 
very eager to direct our relations according to this scenario. 
But nobody will be able to sow a discord between us." According 
to Zvyagilsky, "close and equal relations with Russia were and 
remain the top priority in politics for us". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, ROSSIISKIE VESTI and other newspapers 
print a report on consultations between Russian and German 
Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Klaus Kinkel in Moscow on 
Wednesday. Newspapers note that the sides concentrated on the 
forthcoming visit by President Boris Yeltsin to Germany this May. 
  Writing about a meeting in the United States of the 
Russian-American commission on the fate of U.S. citizens who had 
disappeared in the former Soviet Union, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA 
newspaper carries an interview with a Russian delegation member 
and legislator Dmitriy Volkogonov. He expressed conviction that 
the participation of Russians in the commission "works for the 
prestige of Russia". 
  Newspapers write about talks, which ended in Moscow on 
Wednesday, between the Russian Government and the International 
Monetary Fund to bring closer their positions on Russia's 
economic policy in 1994. 
  Konstantin Kagalovsky, member of the IMF directors board 
from 
Russia, said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA that "good 
personal relations" between Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin and IMF 
managing director Michel Camdessus were a decisive factor for 
the successful completion of the talks. According to the 
newspaper, the IMF wants the Russian side "to rationalise 
production" which means higher rates of privatisation and 
bankruptcies. 
  Continuing this topic, the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA daily 
reproduces a cartoon from the English-language MOSCOW TIMES 
newspaper where our country is depicted holding holey hat, into 
which the IMF tosses "the so-called system credit of 1.5 billion 
U.S. dollars which immediately falls through".

<F P=106> [Joint statement by Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, </F>
Latvia, and Lithuania at the conclusion of their meeting in Riga 
on 23 March, issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
Estonia] 
  [Text] The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Latvia 
and Lithuania issued the following joint statement at the 
conclusion of their meeting today in Riga: 
  The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Latvia and 
Lithuania met in Riga on 23 March, 1994 to discuss inter-Baltic 
cooperation, integration of their countries into all-European 
economic and security structures, relations with the Russian 
Federation, and ties with Ukraine. 
  The Ministers reaffirmed their governments' strong 
conviction 
that all ex-Soviet forces have to be withdrawn from the 
territories of Latvia and Estonia by 31 August, 1994. They 
called upon the international community to continue its 
vigilance that this date will be observed. 
  They expresssed the hope that the Russian Federation and 
Estonia will initial the already prepared draft agreement on the 
withdrawal of all Russian Federation forces from Estonia during 
the upcoming round of negotiations in Moscow on 5-6 April, 1994. 
  The Ministers welcomed the entry into force of the Baltic 
Free Trade Agreement on 1 April and agreed that there is further 
room for strengthening inter-Baltic ties, including the field of 
agricultural trade, where a protocol to the free trade agreement 
needs to be signed. They welcomed the initiative to convene a 
meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Visegrad states 
and Baltic countries to strengthen cooperation between them. 
  The Ministers recalled that they signed a joint letter to 
the 
European Union and the governments of the countries having 
associate memberships with the Union expressing the desire to be 
included in political consultations between associate countries 
and the Union. They reaffirmed that no lines should be drawn 
between the six associate countries, on the one hand, and the 
Baltic states and Slovenia, on the other, and that all 10 of 
these countries should have equal prospects of becoming full 
members of the European Union. They stressed the validity of 
this principle in relations with the Western European Union as 
well and welcomed, in this context, the Pact for Stability in 
Europe, which does not draw such lines. 
  They also welcomed the further developments within NATO's 
Partnership for Peace [PfP] program and reaffirmed their 
countries' commitment to participate actively in the development 
of the PfP, including through the establishement of a joint 
Baltic peace-keeping battalion. They also emphasized their 
countries' desire to eventually become full members of NATO. 
  On the issue of Ukraine, the Ministers agreed that the 
stable 
and democratic development of this country is of great 
importance to security and stability in Europe and concurred 
that it is of utmost importance that international assistance to 
this country be increased to assist its democratic development 
and to help reverse its economic decline. 
  [Signed] Juri Luik, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia 
  George Andrejevs, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Latvia 
  Povilas Gylys, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania 
  Riga, 23 March, 1994 
  The three foreign ministers also signed a "Protocol on 
Consular Representing in Consular Posts of the Republic of 
Estonia, the Republic of Latvia and the Republic of Lithuania." 
The Protocol precedes the signing of an agreement which will 
allow consular posts to provide economic, cultural and other 
information, to protect the rights and interests of the citizens 
of the three Baltic states in cases of detention, death and 
accidents, and to issue certificates of return to citizens who 
have lost their identification documents. 
  A meeting of the expert groups of the Baltic foreign 
ministers took place March 22.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel has called for giving Russia a role in establishing 
new security structures and new architecture of security in 
Europe. 
  Speaking at the inauguration ceremony at a retraining centre 
for the demobilised military in Moscow on Wednesday, Kinkel said 
that relations of strategic partnership should be established 
between Russia and NATO. He stressed that after many years of 
confrontation Russian-German relations are developing on the 
basis of principles of good-neighbourliness, friendship and 
partnership. 
  Kinkel said that the money spent by the German side to build 
the centre and establish a re-training programme for the 
military returning from Germany is a good investment in 
Russian-German friendship and partnership. 
  The German Government said it would allocate 200 million DM 
[German marks] to fund the programme and 7.800 million DM to 
finance housing construction for the military. By the end of 
the year the Russian military should receive 36,000 new 
apartments. 
  Kinkel noted that Germany wants the Russian troops to leave 
it as friends. It is also seeking to ensure the integration of 
democratic Russia into the international community, he added. 
  The German foreign minister said that Germany is looking 
forward to a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on 
August 31, 1994 when the last Russian troops will leave German 
soil.

  [Text] President Yeltsin's forthcoming visit to Germany, 
due to start on May 11, will be a disappointment to "those who 
expect a cooling of relations between Russia and its European 
partners," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in 
Moscow on Wednesday. He was speaking at the end of talks with 
his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. 
  Kozyrev said he and Kinkel held two hours of talks to 
discuss 
how to clear the ground for Yeltsin's visit as well as "over a 
score of other problems and some international issues." He 
spoke of German support to Moscow's approaches for cooperation 
with the G7 nations, the European Union and the Council of 
Europe. 
  Kinkel in turn pledged his country's commitment to getting a 
Russian-EU deal signed as soon as possible. He said Germany 
would take over the EU presidency from July 1 which would give 
it more leverage to influence the situation. "We are aware that 
Russia is in a hard position and it needs support," Kinkel said. 
He also spoke of receiving Kozyrev's assurances that Moscow 
would sign the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace deal. 
  Kinkel does not hold with widespread speculations of signs 
of 
rift between Russia and the West. "Both bilaterally and 
multilaterally, Russia remains Germany's reliable partner," he 
said. "We can say the same about Germany," Kozyrev remarked. 
  Kozyrev described Tuesday's talks between Croatia and Serb 
Kraina at the Russian embassy in Zagreb as a good sign and a 
step in the right direction. In his view, the Washington 
accords between Bosnian Muslims and Croats must be made part of 
a comprehensive settlement. Kozyrev called for compromise 
between the three warring Bosnian communities on the issue of 
the country's integrity. 
  For his part, Kinkel praised Moscow's efforts to help open 
Tuzla airport and create "a better environment in and around 
Sarajevo." 
  Kinkel also spoke of wanting to take part in the first 
session by a joint commission on the return of cultural 
treasures, an issue which would feature on the summit agenda 
though not centrally.

  [Text] A news conference was held yesterday [23 March] at 
the DPRK Embassy in Moscow. DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil 
briefed Russian reporters on the DPRK Foreign Ministry 
spokesman's statement regarding the rupture of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil pointed out that Pyongyang cannot 
but 
take countermeasures against pressure on resuming Team Spirit, 
an ROK-U.S. joint military exercise. 
  Last March, the DPRK declared its decision to withdraw from 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], but temporarily 
suspended its effectuation of such a decision last July so as to 
resume talks with the United States. He pointed out that the 
DPRK cannot but implement its decision to withdraw from the NPT 
if the U.S. Administration breaks up talks with Pyongyang and 
resumes the Team Spirit exercise to step up the nuclear threat 
against the North. He added: Continuing dialogue is also in 
the interest of the United States. We are not in any hurry as 
time is on our side.

<F P=106> [From "Today's World" program] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang's position in connection with the issue 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspection of 
its nuclear weapons is arousing apprehension throughout world. 
Station commentator (Aleksey Kondrachev) writes: 
  What is Moscow's reaction to this matter? In a news 
conference, Gregory Karasin, official spokesman of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry, said: Moscow cannot but express apprehension 
over how the agreement between the IAEA and Pyongyang is being 
carried out. First and foremost, Pyongyang must abide by the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  Regarding the DPRK statement, Gregory Karasin said there are 
doubts about whether the inspections will continue. He pointed 
out that North Korea's remark that it will withdraw from the NPT 
is indeed arousing worry and apprehension around the world. 
Russia hopes that as a member of the NPT, the DPRK will abide 
by its obligations. Also, the DPRK should completely abide by 
the agreements reached with the IAEA. 
  Moscow is calling for bilateral or multilateral talks to 
ease 
the tension surrounding the Korean peninsula. In a news 
conference with reporters, a U.S. undersecretary of state said 
Washington is also calling for a diplomatic solution to the 
issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear facilities. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher pointed out that 
stronger measures could follow, depending on what Pyongyang 
does. He warned that if there is no change in the DPRK's 
position, the UN Security Council [UNSC] may even adopt a 
resolution resulting in sanctions against the DPRK. 
  In a news conference, Takemura Mashiyoshi, director general 
of the general affairs agency, pointed out that Japan is already 
examining what concrete measures it will take if the UNSC 
proclaims sanctions against the DPRK. 
  According to a statement by the official spokesman of the 
French Foreign Ministry, France recognizes that international 
sanctions must be taken against the DPRK. 
  However, Beijing absolutely opposes such a measure. In a 
news conference, Chinese Premier Li Peng said China consistently 
believes that the issue of inspecting the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities must be resolved not through pressure but through 
dialogue and negotiations. 
  Pyongyang's position remains the same. The DPRK is rejecting 
all denunciation. In a news conference in Moscow, the DPRK 
ambassador to Russia said it is inevitable that the DPRK will 
have to take countermeasures against pressure and threats from 
the United States.

  [Text] On Wednesday Viktor Ilyukhin, Chairman of the State 
Duma Security Committee reported to the parliament that there 
exists an instruction requiring the Russian Defense Ministry to 
prepare a plan of withdrawal of forces from four South Kuril 
islands. In his words, the instruction No 53-RP was signed on 
February 4 after Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to 
Japan, however, only that part of the instruction which talks 
about re-burial of Japanese citizens whose graves are on Russian 
territory was made public. 
  In Ilyukhin's estimate, this instruction to the Defense 
Ministry testifies to the beginning of a gradual transfer of the 
Kuril islands to Japan. 
  Ilyukhin also reported that according to available 
information, one company of the ground attack air forces has 
already been withdrawn under the pretext that it was armed with 
obsolete aircraft. Ilyukhin proposed to commission the State 
Duma Committees on International Affairs and on Defense to 
verify this information. 
  Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the parliament's lower house, 
reminded that on Friday Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is 
expected to deliver a speech during the so called "government 
hour." Rybkin proposed to put corresponding questions to the 
Defense Minister. According to a protocol, the State Duma 
International and Defense Committees were commissioned to verify 
Ilyukhin's information. 
  The State Duma refused to include the issue of no-confidence 
in Russia's government into Wednesday's agenda. This proposal 
was put forward by deputy Igor Muravyev (the New Regional Policy 
group). 
  While explaining his demand, Muravyev reminded that the 
Russian government has been acting freely without any control 
since October 1993. He reproached the government for failing to 
develop an anti- crisis program until now and for not solving 
the non-payment and debt crisis in the agricultural industrial 
complex and defense enterprises. According to Muravyev, the 
government was to submit the draft budget for 1994 at the moment 
the State Duma started its work in January, not at the end of 
March. 
  As many as 81 deputies voted for Muravyev's proposal, 106 -- 
against, and 106 abstained.

<F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Camdessus To Recommend IMF </F>
Board Gives Russia Loan"] 
  [Text] The complexity of the current negotiations with the 
Russian Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin's unforeseen day-long 
absence from the capital, and, finally, the persistent desire of 
both parties to achieve a positive outcome forced Frenchman 
Michel Camdessus to somewhat bend the rules of good behavior. 
Instead of appearing as scheduled at 1800 hours, which was put 
off first until 2000 hours and then until 2100 hours, he arrived 
at the meeting with journalists only at 2300 hours on Tuesday 
[22 March]. Only the hardest of the diehards were still 
waiting. We did not wait in vain. 
  Just 20 minutes before the IMF delegation appeared in the 
hall of the Zubovskiy Boulevard Press Center, Mr. Camdessus 
revealed, he and Viktor Chernomyrdin had signed a joint 
statement. 
  The theme running through it was the idea that the Russian 
Government has decided to take additional steps to mobilize 
income for the 1994 budget. In the next few days work should be 
completed on the compilation of a joint government and Central 
Bank memorandum on the Russian leadership's economic policy for 
all of 1994. Following this, the managing director 
[Camdessus] will be prepared to recommend that the IMF Board of 
Directors ratify the decision to release to Russia the second 
tranche of the $1.5-billion Systemic Transformations 
Facility. Thus, realistically, the loan will become 
available during April, in M. Camdessus' opinion. 
  In other words, the mechanism for releasing the second 
tranche of the loan remains in principle the same as the one 
used to allocate the first tranche last June. The situation in 
the Russian economy a year ago was hardly any better than it is 
today. The composition of the government has changed. This may 
have influenced the talks. 
  The size of the budget deficit and the inflation rate at 
year's end were the stumbling blocks in the long discussions 
between the IMF chief and the prime minister and other 
government members. The lack of coordination between approaches 
and assessments initially created a sense of deadlock -- 
something which was reported by most of the Russian and foreign 
media. Yet a specific result was objectively needed by both 
partners. V. Chernomyrdin's government needed it in order to 
assert its reformist image in the eyes of the international 
community following the departure of the reformers; the IMF 
needed it so as not to face an onslaught for the umpteenth time 
from the critics of its policy toward Russia both within the 
country itself and in the West. It was this convergence of 
interests that ultimately resulted in the positive outcome. 
  "We do not have a single major problem left," Michel 
Camdessus stated following the signing of the joint statement. 
So just why did the Russian budget start looking better to the 
IMF chief at the last minute -- where did its extra revenue come 
from? 
  Necessary amendments, he explained, will be forthcoming in 
previously highlighted areas -- certain dates for the receipt of 
specific revenues will be amended, and individual tariffs and 
taxes will be reviewed. Mr. Camdessus admitted that it has 
always been difficult to collect taxes in Russia and to obtain 
other revenue for the budget. Russians will now be helped to 
remedy this state of affairs by IMF experts -- fiscal texts will 
be drawn up more exactly, and a number of additional measures to 
enhance the effectiveness of the tax system will also be 
outlined. 
  The draft Russian budget faces one further test in the next 
few days -- ratification by the Duma. Budgets generally find it 
hard going to pass through any parliament in the world, the IMF 
managing director noted. In order to get a better idea of the 
Russian budget's chances, he also met with Ivan Rybkin and 
Sergey Glazyev. In M. Camdessus' opinion, the parliamentarians 
are prepared to adopt the budget, although there will probably 
be some problems.

  [Text] Moscow and Vilnius have reached agreement to set up 
checkpoints on the border between Russia's western exclave of 
Kaliningrad and Lithuania after two days of talks in the Russian 
capital, Russian chief negotiator Viktor Isakov told Interfax on 
Wednesday. 
  He said that experts on both sides would meet in Vilnius and 
Moscow next month to draw up agreements on travelling and 
customs procedures and on the transit of Russian vehicles and 
trains via Lithuania to Kaliningrad. 
  However, no agreement on military transit is envisaged 
following Lithuania's plans to adopt a special government 
resolution or law on the transit of military or dangerous 
cargoes through the country's territory. It was agreed that 
Russian and Lithuanian experts would meet in May to discuss the 
issue. 
  Agreement was also reached that the question of payment of 
foreign cash to Lithuanians holding accounts with the former 
USSR Vneshekonombank would be discussed at the level of experts. 
  The Russian diplomat said that last November's trade and 
economic agreement easing trade barriers against Lithuania would 
be effective only after the package on Kaliningrad was signed. 
  The next round of talks will be held in Vilnius late in 
April 
or early in May.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- The singing of an agreement 
on cooperation between the chambers of commerce of the Russian 
Federation and Latvia was one of the major events of the 
Russian-Latvian business meeting in Moscow on Wednesday. 
  The document calls for assistance to business people of the 
two countries in developing and strengthening bilateral ties on 
a mutually advantageous basis. But most importantly, as 
Stanislav Smirnov and Albert Grozberg, chairmen of the Russian 
and Latvian chambers of commerce, said, is that the agreement is 
"the first concrete step in the development of bilateral 
relations since the recent initialing of Russian-Latvian accords 
which have resolved many problems."

  [Text] Last night a public meeting organized by the 
Estonian Citizens' Union took place at the Nomme people's hall. 
Speaking to a large audience were Riigikogu [parliament] 
members Juri Toomepuu [Estonian Citizens' Union chairman] and 
Peeter Lorents the press service of the Citizens' Union reported 
to ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency]. Toomepuu spoke about the 
ethical crisis, which according to him is rife in government 
circles, the ensuing waste, and state-owned companies being 
turned into private firms by illegal means and criminal 
incompetence. According to Lorents the government has so far 
still not managed to move from the economy of spending to the 
economy of revenues. A mighty flow of money and resources 
travels in Estonia without any control and taxation, he said. 
  According to the press service of the Citizens' Union, the 
public meeting at Nomme decided to appeal to the Estonian public 
and government in order to voice their dismay with the 
catastrophically declining economic and social policies. At a 
proposal from Toomepuu, it was decided to call to the Riigikogu 
and government to introduce a link between pensions and the 
average wage. Many people of Nomme demanded the government's 
resignation which met with a unanimous support from the whole 
audience.

<F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>
  [Text] The decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton, of 
Tuesday [22 March], to lift ban on the sale of arms to the 
Baltic states was a logical continuation of the developments 
that have taken place in the post-Communist states, opening all 
world's arms markets to Estonia, head of Estonian parliament's 
state defence committee Rein Helme told ETA, on Wednesday. 
  "The fact that the ban on arms sales was abolished proves 
that the policy of the Estonian government in enacting a 
demonstration breakthrough in obtaining arms from Israel was 
right," Helme said, recalling the Israeli-Estonian arms deal of 
$49 million, concluded last year. Helme stated that from now on 
it is possible that arms will be obtained from several NATO 
states, admitting, however, that there was no need for 
additional large arms deals between Estonia and foreign 
countries in the nearest future. 
  MP Trivimi Velliste told ETA that Clinton's decision was a 
"serious step in strengthening the international position of the 
Baltic states", which could be connected with the active 
participation of the Baltic states in the Partnership for Peace 
programme.

removal was applied to take Rozhok to the psychiatrist. 
According to the code on criminal procedures, a person may be 
taken for a psychiatric specialist opinion if he fails to do so 
voluntarily. The Interor Ministry's adviser, (?Kaja Tullo) told 
BNS that Rozhok has not been arrested. If psychiatrists do not 
find his condition dangerous to society, he will be freed. 
Rozhok has also a right to a lawyer and to contact the Russian 
Embassy and to demand that another psychiatric opinion be 
carried out. As is known, the security police have accused 
Rozhok of inciting inter-ethnic hatred.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- Negotiations are scheduled 
to begin on Wednesday [23 March] between Pro Patria, the senior 
party in Estonia's ruling coalition, and their fellow coalition 
members Rural Centrists, who have threatened to quit over that 
the government allegedly is defying the interests of farmers. 
  Pro Patria will be represented at the talks by the party 
Chairman Mart Laar, General Secretary Ivo Rull, deputy head of 
the parliament faction, Kalle Jurgenson, and MP Vootele Hansen. 
The delegation of Rural Centrists will include party Chairman 
Ivar Raig, chairman of the party's Central Council, Vambo Kaal, 
Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar and Minister of Reform Liia 
Hanni. 
  MP Vootele Hansen in a brief interview with BNS said the 
meeting was to discuss finding finances to credit the farm 
sector, as well as drawing up legislation for regulation of the 
market. "Of course, we don't consider it possible to give up 
free market principles," he said. 
  Rural Centrist Party's Vambo Kaal, in turn, said his party 
hoped to resolve issues such as protecting of the domestic 
market, financing and taxation of the rural economy, 
privatization, problems of cooperation within the coalition. 
  "If we fail to succeed in resolving the problems by mutual 
compromise, we cannot continue our activity as part of the 
coalition," Kaal said. 
  Pro Patria this week is also to begin talks with the Social 
Democrats, the other party beside Rural Centrists in the ruling 
coalition's Moderate bloc. Mart Laar, Ivo Rull, as well as Pro 
Patria parliament faction chairman Tiit Sinissaar and Defense 
Minister Indrek Kannik are to sit down at the negotiating table 
opposite a delegation of the Social Democrats led by the leader 
of the party, Social Affairs Minister Marju Lauristin. 
  Mihkel Parnoja, deputy chairman of the Social Democrats, has 
told BNS the key issue for his party at talks with the senior 
coalition partner is cooperation within the coalition until next 
the elections. He said cooperation within the coalition could 
be better, especially since over some issues coordination in the 
coalition tends to happen too late.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 23, BNS -- Reactivated farm exports to 
Russia have brought up demand particularly for dairy products. 
This is also adding to the rise in food prices in Estonia, 
experts say. 
  The country's agriculture minister in his comments today 
denied that growing exports could have a major impact on the 
price rise, saying the development was natural in moving closer 
to the European price level. 
  Prices of farm products on the domestic market will continue 
to rise for some time to come and the rise apparently won't stop 
before the prices reach the European level, Estonian Agriculture 
Minister Jaan Leetsar told BNS. 
  "Rise in domestic market prices is an absolutely normal 
phenomenon and I wouldn't link it with the increase in exports 
or rise in inflation," the minister said in the interview. 
  Estonia's largest manufacturers of cheese, the dairy 
processing companies in Voru and Paide, are selling about 50 
percent of their products on the domestic market, while about 
30-40 percent goes to Russia, Leetsar said. Demand is so high 
that partners from Russia come to Estonia themselves to buy 
these products, so that the Estonian producer no longer has to 
deal with the customs problems, he said. 
  Experts say the sudden price rise in Russia has increased 
exports to that country. Because of a shortage of raw products, 
especially of milk, also prices on the Estonian market are 
growing more quickly and causing higher inflation. 
  The agriculture minister dismissed the allegations, saying a 
shortage of raw products had caused the problem. This is 
because milk production has been unprofitable for a long time in 
Estonia, he said. The minister also said Estonia's supplies 
largely depended on the time of the year and on previous 
summer's weather. 
  Estonia is estimated to reach the 1990 figures in its farm 
output only by the turn of the century. Statistics reports show 
Estonia's farm sector, apart from private farmers, sold 90,500 
tons of meat to meat processing companies in 1993, which is down 
36 percent from the year before. 
  The output of milk in the state-owned and reformed 
collective 
sectors declined 25 percent to 510,100 tons in the same period. 
For eggs, the decline was 36 percent to 220 million eggs. The 
private sector's output decreased 38 percent to 81,400 tons for 
meat, and by 17 percent to 592,200 tons for milk in one year to 
1993. The figures only show the amounts bought by meat and 
dairy processing companies and fail to reflect the substantial 
role of direct sales on open markets, etc.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima 
(parliament) Human Rights Committee has completed a bill on the 
status of politically repressed persons, Dainis Vanags, head of 
a committee investigating into crimes of the totalitarian 
regime, told reporters Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Under the bill, the status can be granted not only to 
Latvian 
citizens but also to permanent residents who suffered either 
from the Communist or Nazi regimes in Latvia. 
  The bill, unlike the currently effective law, recognizes the 
two occupation regimes in Latvia, said Inese Birzniece, head of 
the Human Rights Committee. Presently, 28,000 people have 
certificates of politically repressed persons in Latvia. 
  The committee will submit the bill for Saeima consideration 
March 28.

  [Text] The Latvian government is prepared to approve a 
package of interstate treaties with Russia on the Russian troop 
withdrawal. Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told a 
briefing that the government would make an official announcement 
next Tuesday. 
  At the recent round of the bilateral talks the two sides 
initialed the drafts of three out of four documents -- the main 
treaty setting the withdrawal date of August 31, 1994; 
agreements on the social protection of servicemen during the 
troop withdrawal; and on pensioners of the Russian Defense 
Ministry living in Latvia. In the draft agreement on the status 
of the Russian radar station in Skrunda, according to which the 
strategic base may continue for 5.5 years to come, the provision 
on the lease payment remains uncoordinated. 
  At the briefing Birkavs admitted that Latvia is proposed to 
agree to a compromise under pressure of the presence of the 
Russian troops. The prime Minister noted that the signing of an 
agreement will be advantageous for Latvia. First, Russia will 
assume international commitments to withdraw troops before the 
end of summer, while representatives of international 
authoritative organizations will monitor the radar dismantling. 
  If the treaty is not signed, Latvia will be internationally 
isolated since it will acquire an image as an unreliable 
partner. No doubt, in this case the Russian troop withdrawal 
will be suspended and would be unlikely to be completed this 
year, said Birkavs. 
  He believes the documents may be signed later in April in 
Moscow at the meeting of presidents Boris Yeltsin and Guntis 
Ulmanis.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Government Information 
Agency issued an explanatory statement Wednesday [23 March] on 
the March 15 agreement between Latvian and Russian negotiators 
on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, which forsees 
temporary operation of a radar station at Skrunda. 
  Russia has completely given up the idea to use the newest 
block of the radar station, according to the statement. The 
newest part of the compound will be transferred to the Latvian 
authority as soon as the withdrawal agreement is signed. 
  The United States has pledged Latvia 10 million USD needed 
to 
start the radar's dismantling. Russia, in its turn, promised to 
supply the equipment necessary to dismantle the newest block of 
the station. 
  Currently, the Skrunda early-warning antimissile radar 
occupies 1,008 hectares. After the agreement is signed, Latvia 
starts to control more than 80 percent of the territory. Russia 
continues its actitivities on 164 hectares of the total area for 
four years. 
  The draft agreement also forsees that Russia substitutes 
part 
of the radar's military personnel with civilians. The civil 
staff may be Latvian citizens and permanent residents. 
  Under the agreement, Russia should not change the functions 
or the equipment of the radar station. The "old" radar, built 
in late 1960's, is "morally and physically outdated," Soviet 
specialists said already in 1990. 
  Russia may even decide to suspend the operation of the 
costly 
and ineffective installation in view of its complicated domestic 
situation, the Latvian Government said in the statement. 
Moreover, Russia may start to use the Baranovici radar, which 
is still under construction, before the temporary operation term 
expires.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- Latvia should adopt a law on 
the status of aliens and stateless persons before signing the 
troop withdrawal agreement with Russia, the Saeima (parliament) 
Foreign Affairs Committee said Wednesday [21 March]. 
  The United Nations Organization should be persuaded to 
recognize the fact of Latvia's occupation by Russia in 1940. 
The adoption of the country's foreign political concept is 
another urgent task, the committee said. 
  Latvia also created problems to Estonia when it promised 
Russia to guarantee the rights of retired Russian servicemen. 
Estonia has already adopted a law on aliens which does not 
forsee an option of social guarantees for Russian military 
persons, said committee head Alexander Kirsteins. The committee 
decided to send a member of the Latvian team for talks with 
Russia to Estonia in a bid to coordinate stances. 
  Commenting on the appeal to the parliaments of U.N. member 
states, committee member Indulis Berzins said that a Russian 
diplomat said officially that Russia was unlikely to recognize 
Latvia's occupation in 1940. 
  The committee concluded that its members should meet with 
the 
head of the Russian parliament Foreign Committee, Genadi Lukin, 
to discuss Russia's attitude toward Latvia's occupation.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, BNS -- The Latvian Supreme Court 
concluded proceedings Tuesday [22 March] in an unlicensed drug 
production case and sentenced the main culprits to three to 
seven years in prison, with property confiscation. 
  The former director general of the state-owned Latbiofarm 
pharmaceutical factory, Ilmars Penke, was convicted for grave 
abuse of service status and large scale keeping and trafficking 
narcotic drugs in acquisitive purposes. 
  Penke was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with 
property 
confiscation, except his summer house. The charges on Penke's 
deputy, Vyacheslav Kulikov, were the same, his sentence is seven 
and a half years imprisonment with property confiscation. The 
third accomplice, the former central laboratory chief Janis Osis 
was convicted for three and a half years with property 
confiscation. The court maintained that Penke and Kulikov were 
driven by covetousness but Osis -- by other personal motives. 
  The Criminal Police Department was commissioned to destroy 
the material evidence of 1 million pills of amphetamine group 
stimulants of the central nervous system, which were produced 
illegally under the disguise of flu medicine. The defendants' 
defense lawyers said they would appeal. 
  In total, Latbiofarm made 16 million pills of MDA 
amphetamine 
drug between July 14, 1992, and Dec. 1, 1992, against a contract 
with a Slovakian firm. 
  Fifteen million, or 4.5 tons of the drug, were sent to 
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, under the shield name of 
remantadine. The German police detected more than 3 tons of MDA 
tablets in the city airport in December, 1992. One third of the 
pills was never found, police reports. 
  The investigation proved that Penke and Kulikov received 
from 
the Slovakian Weinwurm &amp; Co. firm 198,000 Dutch guilders and 
196,500 German marks. Penke and Kulikov divided the money and 
kept it at home. At court, they testified that they would have 
used the resources to pay bonuses to workers. 
  The convicted manufacturers deny their guilt saying they did 
not know they produced a narcotic drug. The court said the 
defendants had substantially undermined the international 
prestige of Latvia as an independent country.

<F P=106> [Interview with L. Mucins, parliamentary secretary of the </F>
Latvian Interior Ministry, by A. Borovkov; place and date not 
given: "Evasive in the Meantime"] 
  [Text] [Borovkov] First of all, I would like to find out 
what are the duties of the Interior Ministry parliamentary 
secretary. 
  [Mucins] The interior minister and I are the political 
leaders of the ministry, while Colonel Staris, Interior Ministry 
state secretary, is the highest "uniformed" official in our 
department. There are three major groups of my official 
functions. First of all, I am responsible for relations with 
the legislature. There are a lot of committees in the 
parliament and Minister Kristovskis himself is working in one of 
them. Thus, at the sessions of committees, and even sometimes 
at the Council of Ministers, I have to represent the interests 
of my ministry. I sometimes speak at plenary sessions on behalf 
of the council, including the presentation of certain draft 
laws. Secondly, the parliamentary secretary takes part in the 
sessions of the Council of Ministers and its three committees. 
For example, I have recently reported on adopting a new 
progressive system of penitentiary institutions. We are 
eliminating camps and adopting the system of prisons. Finally, 
the third direction of my activity is so-called ministerial. It 
includes the drafting of documents, for example the ministry's 
charter, reorganizing our structures, and the like. Alas, 
whether someone likes it or not, sessions take up half of my 
working time. 
  [Borovkov] To what extent does the legal footing correspond 
to the current realities? 
  [Mucins] Unlike other people, I have nobody to blame for 
this. If a necessary law does not exist I am the very person who 
is supposed to draft it. However, the analysis of criminal 
activities in the Republic shows that there is a need for 
certain corrections in the legal sphere. 
  [Borovkov] What kind of corrections? 
  [Mucins] Take car thefts for example. It is easy to reach a 
conclusion about improving the procedure of trading and 
registering cars, adopting other measures. Last year, more than 
1,800 cars were stolen and only 10 percent of those thefts have 
been investigated. This is much less than in other categories of 
crime. 
  [Borovkov] Does organized crime exist in Latvia? 
  [Mucins] Of course there is organized crime, and car thefts 
are a prime example. What is organized crime? First of all, 
this is a sociological rather than legal term. We will hardly 
have an article on organized crime in our criminal code. It is 
enough to have an article envisioning responsibility for being 
an organizer of a crime. However, we have had virtually no 
cases where we could prove this crime. Frankly speaking, we 
have only been arresting small fries. On the basis of 
operational data, we can only guess that this or other person is 
an organizer of a specific robbery, murder, or case of 
racketeering. Organized crime means a precise division of 
duties. Speaking of car thefts, there are people who learn that 
a new car has been registered (this also means that information 
leaks occur), others learn where the car is being kept, still 
others steal it, drive across the border, sell it, and so on. 
  [Borovkov] What about the term "Mafia," which is so loved by 
the press? 
  [Mucins] We are using this term to denote the merging of 
organized crime with state structures. For example, the merging 
of criminal groups with the militia was noticed as far back as 
the 1970's. This trend has hardly been decreasing ever since. 
It must be at the same level, if not higher. 
  [Borovkov] However, almost the entire bureaucratic machine 
has been replaced in Latvia. 
  [Mucins] I cannot cite any facts or concrete accusations in 
this regard, but the trend remains. We keep this in mind. A 
hundred hares do not amount to a single horse; a hundred 
suspicions do not amount to a single fact. In one particular 
case, an investigator acted as a middleman between an executive 
body official and a man who wanted to privatize a facility on 
favorable terms. However, these kinds of crimes should be fought 
by special structures. Regular police methods do not work. The 
police here work like a fire brigade, rushing to those places 
that are already on fire. Thank God, we somehow manage to do 
this, but we need specialists who could work on prevention, 
analyze data, and plan in advance. 
  [Borovkov] Speaking of fighting economic crime, how are 
things going in this regard, given that the Department for 
Fighting Thefts of Socialist Property has been disbanded? 
  [Mucins] This is both good and bad. People from the 
department joined other structures, because they would not be 
able to work up to the new economic realities. On the other 
hand, we must form a structure for fighting thefts of not only 
socialist but all kinds of property, corruption, fake 
bankruptcy, and the like. However, we need new people with a new 
kind of knowledge. When we are through reorganizing the general 
structure of the ministry, we will get down to reorganizing 
individual departments.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 23, LETA -- Former chief of Russian 
secret service KGB in Latvia, Alfons Noviks, 86, who has been 
arrested last week facing charges of genocide against residents 
of Latvia, has been transferred to the hospital prison ward with 
a fit of high blood pressure, says the daily "Neatkariga Cina", 
citing Uldis Strelis, Deputy Prosecutor General of Latvia. 
  Other officers of the notorious former Soviet secret police 
are to follow Noviks and be put to prison, maintains the daily 
"Diena", indicating that a surge of arrests of other colleagues 
of Noviks and those directly involved in repressions which have 
been carried out in Latvia, is to be expected in the near 
future. Evidences are being collected and witness interrogated 
in probes of several other offices of the former KGB who are 
facing the same charges as their former chief. Up to now many 
victims of the past repressions have feared to give evidence and 
to turn in documentary evidences of criminal activities by 
Alfons Noviks and executors of his orders, said Dainis Vanags, 
chairman of the committee of totalitarian crimes investigation. 
However, during the last two months people have become more 
active in supplying the committee with numerous materials of 
help in investigating the cases.

<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Cherkasova under the general heading </F>
"Death in the Russian Skies": "Kemerovo Calling"] 
  [Text] The Novokuznetsk air traffic controllers were the 
first to get worried: At about 0100 hours local time on 23 
March, a plane traveling on the Moscow to Hong Kong route 
stopped responding to radio signals. All attempts to contact 
the crew from the ground or the air proved fruitless. The chain 
of tracking points, Yekaterinburg--Novokuznetsk--Krasnoyarsk, 
showed that the last of these points had received no signals 
from the plane. Weather conditions, by Siberian standards, were 
ideal for the time of year: With a temperature of minus 5, 
visibility was 10-12 km. 
  At 2310 hours Moscow time, an AN-12 plane and an MI-8 
helicopter took off from Mezhdurechensk. After 20 minutes the 
pilots located a burning section of taiga approximately 17 km 
south of the taiga settlement of Mayzas. This is a sector of 
dense, neglected taiga where timber cutting stopped 20-30 years 
ago. A snow cover 1.5-2 meters thick and dense growths of young 
fir, spruce, birch, and willow make the locality virtually 
inaccessible for aircraft landings. 
  Although journalists are strictly prohibited at the disaster 
site before the special commission starts work, our 
Mezhdurechensk colleague Vasiliy Gorbunov managed to get there 
with a rescue party. Here is what he said: 
  "The first impression, as you approach, is a very strong 
smell of kerosene. You look around -- and it's spooky: a heap 
of small debris. It looks like the plane literally broke into 
smithereens. The smallest fragments are scattered over the side 
of the hill in a band 100 meters wide, stretching for 
approximately half a kilometer. The biggest fragment of the 
starboard side which I saw is 3 by 4 meters. Bodies? Nearly 
everything that is left of the people is deeply embedded in the 
snow. You can see arms here, legs there, torsos there. If -- 
God forbid -- the frost deepens, the boys will have to work with 
crowbars to dig the remains out of blocks of ice. In these 
places, the worst thought is this: Why are objects more durable 
than people? Scattered all over the place are beer cans, bags, 
items of clothing, dollars.... I could not tear my eyes away 
from a brightly colored Easter egg: Someone was preparing for 
the holiday." 
  There has been a report that the plane's descent was 
directly 
observed from the ground by the driver of a timber truck who was 
stuck on the Orton to Mayzas road. He was changing a wheel, 
when there was a loud booming noise in the sky. Then he saw a 
plane trailing smoke, trying to maneuver, probably so as to make 
a landing on the hillside. A few minutes later there was an 
explosion.... 
  The prosecutor's office is carefully studying the evidence 
of 
the witness, whose name we have not yet managed to discover. 
That is not surprising: This region of the Kuzbass is 
inhabited mainly by citizens who are serving sentences for 
various kinds of crime.

getting ready to meet him in Moscow next weekend. This was 
reported today by Sergey Filatov, the leader of the 
administration of the head of state, in an interview to an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent. 
  In his words, he phoned Boris Yeltsin in Sochi today, but 
the 
president, together with his aide Lev Sukhanov were on the 
tennis court at the time. In response to a question by an 
ITAR-TASS correspondent asking why, during the vacation, Yeltsin 
does not talk to the press -- as leaders of other states do, and 
thus gives grounds for rumors about his ill health -- Filatov 
answered: There are as many characters as there are people. 
Boris Yeltsin is not Bill Clinton, and he has the right to his 
own style of behavior.

  [Text] Aleksandr Shokhin, appointed deputy prime minister 
of Russia, plans to pursue an active policy of economic 
stabilization. He said at a sitting of the government presidium 
that the policy of economic stabilization should lie in 
implementation of the most promising projects capable of bearing 
fruit in 1994-1995. The deputy prime minister believes that if 
such a policy is carried out, within a year the slump in 
industry will reach 12 percent, while the gross domestic product 
will be 80 percent of the 1993 level. If this happens, Shokhin 
predicts that the monthly rate of inflation could reach seven to 
nine percent by the end of the year. The deputy prime minister 
believes it necessary to mobilize all means of increasing the 
revenue side of the budget.

<F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report: "Special Appointment"] </F>
  [Text] Russia has a new member of the cabinet of ministers 
-- Mikhail Barsukov, head of the Russian Federation Main 
Security Directorate [MSD]. 
  Having been elevated to the level of a ministry, his agency 
continues to perform the functions of guarding the Russian 
establishment. No one, however, knows how wide its powers are 
because MSD activities are guided by a classified statute. In 
the opinion of acting Constitutional Court Chairman Nikolay 
Vitruk, at the present moment the MSD can bring pressure to bear 
on any, the most senior politicians of the country. Indeed, in 
Vitruk's words, the MSD "is in charge" not only of bodyguards 
but also of government limousines, special communications 
facilities, health centers, stores, tailoring establishments, 
and the other goodies of former special distributors. 
  Thus, on the one hand Minister Barsukov is supposed to take 
orders from the premier and his vice premiers. But on the 
other, it is on himself that all of them depend.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Shakhray by TRUD political observer </F>
Yuriy Lepskiy: "Sergey Shakhray: You Cannot Be the Judge at 
Your Own Trial"] 
  [Text] [Lepskiy] You, or rather your faction in the Duma, 
initiated the amnesty, which caused a great stir. What made you 
do it? 
  [Shakhray] Yes, we voted for the amnesty, but unfortunately 
it did not turn out to be quite so easy to explain our position 
in the mass media. Alas, in the period of the election campaign 
we encountered the concept of "democratic censorship".... So I 
am grateful to the very popular TRUD for the opportunity to 
express my view on this matter. 
  So, I believe that we voted absolutely correctly. And it was 
not a sudden decision on our part. We had been committed to it 
for quite a long time, since the founding congress of the Party 
of Russian Unity and Accord, since 17 October 1993. The essence 
of our position is that we regard the events of 3-4 October in 
Moscow as an episode of civil war. And the responsibility for 
it is borne equally by all branches of federal power. They 
failed to reach agreement, they failed to prevent the loss of 
150 lives. Civil conflicts like this cannot be assessed by 
means of juridical rulings and court verdicts. You cannot be 
the judge at your own trial. The logic of civil confrontations 
knows only one way out: the quest for civil reconciliation. 
Everyone must show repentance to the relatives of those who 
died, create humane conditions for those who survived, and try 
in future to minimize the negative consequences of the conflict. 
That is what must be done. And that is what we were guided by 
when we voted for the amnesty. But that is not all. TRUD 
readers should know that at the same time we voted for the 
memorandum on accord and for the decree on disbanding the 
parliamentary commission to investigate the events of 3-4 
October. 
  [Lepskiy] Were the possible consequences of the amnesty 
studied beforehand? 
  [Shakhray] Of course. This was a political decision, and in 
politics you have to know how to "calculate" how a situation 
will develop many moves ahead. We predicted that two main 
trends would emerge after the amnesty. First, the possibility 
of closer cooperation between the president and the State Duma. 
We were working on the basis that the majority in the Duma will 
fulfill its election promises with the help of the amnesty, and 
that the "Lefortovo" politicians will be at liberty. But at the 
same time in the Russian political theater's 1994 season they 
only have the opportunity to be spectators, since all the roles 
have already been assigned. Neither Zyuganov nor Rybkin is 
going to give up his place and his influence to Khasbulatov, 
Rutskoy, or anyone else. So, like it or not, the interests of 
the Duma leaders and the interests of the president temporarily 
coincided: The freed men are restricted in their opportunities 
to engage in effective political activity. 
  Second, we were working on the basis that the political 
climate in society is today determined by three groups (or 
elites): the Moscow, the regional, and the sector group. In 
the sector group, the leading role is played by the 
military-industrial and oil-and-gas complexes. The sector and 
regional elites have recently been cooperating actively and 
coming together as a counterweight to the Moscow elite. The 
latter, preparing for a new division of powers, has concentrated 
more than 70 percent of Russia's banking capital in its hands. 
And now the country's political climate will be determined by 
how relations develop between these groups -- peacefully or 
otherwise. These "mainsprings" and "levers" will control all 
political events of any importance in the near future. 
  Prior to the amnesty the mood was such that in April-May 
there would have been a round of acute political struggle, and 
the victim would have been Viktor Chernomyrdin's government. 
The political figures who have come out of jail have "tangled" 
the threads of these plans. Thus society has won a respite for 
a few months, and the May crisis will most likely not take 
place. Heaven knows, we should use this respite to achieve 
accord and peace. 
  [Lepskiy] When you talk about peace and accord, are you 
thinking only of the possible events in Moscow? 
  [Shakhray] Not only. Take, for instance, another 
consequence of the amnesty -- Khasbulatov's return to Chechnya. 
Things could hardly get any worse in Chechnya. And if 
Khasbulatov sees with his own eyes how people are living, what a 
disastrous situation the Chechen people are in, then I do not 
think it is impossible that he will help promote the 
negotiations process and the normalization of relations between 
Chechnya and Russia. 
  [Lepskiy] So how do things stand as regards the drafting of 
a memorandum or pact on civil accord? 
  [Shakhray] Well, strictly speaking, the Duma has already 
adopted a memorandum on accord. It is another matter that the 
president has set the problem of drafting another document -- a 
pact (let us call it that) on civil peace. I very much wish to 
hope that this will not be an alternative to the document 
already adopted by the Duma. If it is an alternative, we will 
soon find ourselves with... a war between pacts on civil peace. 
  [Lepskiy] As I understand it, the president wants this 
document to be signed by people from the "risk group" -- those 
who have come out of Lefortovo and other old hands at organizing 
dangerous May Day parades.... 
  [Shakhray] I am in favor of the document being signed by 
representatives of all the really active political forces 
without exception. Including the people who have come out of 
Lefortovo. 
  [Lepskiy] The whole question is, is such a compromise really 
possible? Does your personal experience of work in the Duma 
persuade you that compromise is possible? 
  [Shakhray] Unlike the former Supreme Soviet, the State Duma 
is quite well structured politically -- there are factions 
representing the parties. And -- a very important point -- no 
one faction has a sufficient majority of votes to push through 
its own version of a legislative decision. For a decision to be 
adopted, whether you like it or not, you have to seek a general 
consensus. So the Duma council has arisen -- something in the 
nature of a permanent conciliation commission. This is a very 
important component in the future machinery of accord. I hope 
you and I will live to see the day when this machinery will 
operate smoothly everywhere. In any case, at the moment I can 
only say that given the will and a sense of responsibility, 
social peace can be achieved.

  [Text] Stavropol March 23 TASS -- Sergey Shakhray, Russian 
minister for nasionalities said he will participate in the 
presidential campaign only as a voter. He believes he has to 
learn a great deal and accumulate experience before becoming 
ready for nomination. Sakhray said this in an exclusive 
interview to Stavropol radio. 
  A number of problems regarding the improvement of the 
economic, social and political situation in the multi-ethnic 
region on the northern Caucasus was raised in the interview. 
The settlement of the drawn-out Ingush-Ossetian conflict is 
quite realistic on a basis of agreements signed last year by 
plenipotentiary Ingush and Ossetian delegations, Shakhray 
believes. However, practical implementaion of these fundamental 
thoroughly-considered documents is yet far off. 
  The Ministries of Defence and Interior of the Russian 
Federation have not yet fulfilled the provisions of the Russian 
president's decrees and Kislovodsk agreements regarding 
disarmament of unlawful units and confiscation of arms from both 
conflicting sides. At least armoured equipment should be 
urgently withdrawn from the zone of the conflict, Shakhray said. 
  Sakhray also toughed upon Chechen problem. He said the 
experience on the development and signing of a treaty between 
Moscow and Tatarstan should be used for this.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Vice President Aleksandr </F>
Rutskoy by Roberto Livi in Moscow; date not given: "Rutskoy: I 
Will Be the One To Challenge Yeltsin"] 
  [Excerpt] Moscow -- [passage omitted] This question was 
necessary: What did Rutskoy think of the rumors about the coup? 
And also about the accusations addressed to him? Rutskoy gets 
off to a flying start: "It has all been invented in order to 
take attention away from the serious crisis that the people in 
the country are experiencing. The men in the regime are looking 
for a scapegoat. This is what happened in 1991 when the 
Communist Party was destroyed because it was becoming too much 
of a nuisance. Then the same thing happened again the following 
year in 1992. The target was the Supreme Soviet. In October 
1993 they shelled Parliament. Now once again they want to 
eliminate those who are a nuisance. Nobody planned a coup 
because there has already been one." 
  [Livi] In practice, are you saying that the president's men 
were the ones that spread the rumors about the coup? 
  [Rutskoy] I do not know who spread the rumors. What I can 
say 
is that it is all an act. I am sure that it is a farce. 
  [Livi] The alarm, the threat of destabilization: Everything 
points to a degenerating situation. What are your forecasts for 
the future? 
  [Rutskoy] Forecasts? The term sounds excessive. But this 
instability, this making the boat rock from one side to the 
other, the underhanded political games: These usually have a 
bad ending. 
  [Livi] Do you think that there could be a repetition of what 
happened last October, i.e., a hard and bloody confrontation? 
  [Rutskoy] Everything seems possible today. God save us, 
however, I would not want to experience those events again. I 
have had enough time to think over what happened and to draw my 
conclusions. 
  [Livi] Which? 
  [Rutskoy] That the current situation in Russia is a 
difficult 
one. But we must not dramatize. A remedy can be found. As 
long as we act on basic territory, the economy. As long as the 
people do not have enough to eat, as long as they do not have 
houses, medicine, and the security of stable laws, there is no 
talk of this. The state must regain control of and manage the 
economy. The reforms, incentives for production, and respect 
for the law must be redefined. Policy today must be based on 
these priorities if we want stabilization in the country. 
  [Livi] Is this a presidential program? Will you present 
yourself at the presidential elections? 
  [Rutskoy] Keep calm. Perhaps those elections have already 
been announced without my knowing anything? First, we must get 
to the elections. And then it will be necessary for somebody to 
propose my candidature. In that case we will see. I am ready, 
I have stated clearly what my positions are. 
  [Livi] The new center-left "Agreement for Russia" opposition 
front is not looking at you as a candidate, then? 
  [Rutskoy] According to me, all the political and social 
movements that are developing in the capital do not have a great 
deal of influence on the current situation. As I said before, 
the stability of Russian society depends only on the solution of 
vital problems: i.e., economic ones. 
  [Livi] How do you feel? Already president; vice president, 
as you were before last October, or former vice president? 
  [Rutskoy] It depends on how one judges the events of last 
fall. If the coup (by President Yeltsin -- IL MESSAGGERO 
editor's note) is considered legitimate, then I am the former 
vice president. But if it was against the law -- and is to be 
considered such according to the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation -- then I remain vice president. However, according 
to the law I am a Russian citizen, with all the rights that 
derive from this. [Rutskoy ends] 
  There is no use insisting. The bodyguards form an 
impenetrable ring. The cameramen who try to break through are 
pushed back, somebody in the crowd falls roughly on the ground. 
Rutskoy has said what he wanted to. That he is not the 
candidate of a party, but of a vast popular protest front. That 
he is the anti-Yeltsin for the people who cannot make ends meet 
today and who want to put an end to the "new rich" and the 
mafia. The czar of the ultranationalists, Zhirinovskiy, will 
have a tough nut to crack. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Andrey Streletskiy report under the "Special Services" </F>
rubric: "Federal Counterintelligence Service Knew About the 
Coup `Version' and Informed Russian Leaders About it in Advance"] 
  [Text] The Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service 
[FCS] had the text of the scandalous document at its disposal 
several days before the so-called "Version No. 1," with the 
details of an alleged coup d'etat being prepared in the country, 
was published in the press. More than that, the text procured 
by FCS officers had been immediately forwarded to "the top" -- 
to the Russian president's staff. The authorities, therefore, 
did know about the planned publication, but preferred to take no 
preemptive measures thus unwittingly helping the noisy scandal 
erupt. 
  In the FCS Public Relations Center, they would not tell your 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent in detail about precisely how 
the chekists had managed to obtain "Version No. 1." FCS 
officers are currently going ahead with operation-technical 
measures with experienced specialists taking part whose task is 
to locate the author of the text. According to Aleksandr 
Mikhaylov, head of the FCS Public Relations Center, "it is 
extremely difficult to determine the circle of politically 
interested persons because `Version No. 1' contains far too much 
downright gibberish." It is the document's gibberish quality, 
as well as the fact that it was promptly sent over to the 
president's staff, that made FCS officers believe there would be 
no scandal. Nevertheless their prognosis was not justified. 
This probably did not surprise professional chekists much. 
Many of them have long been complaining of the fact that the 
country's leadership often either ignores "hot" information 
coming from the security organs, or having taken the information 
to consideration it takes absolutely inadequate measures. "This 
happens every time -- we suggest one thing but they do something 
totally different," chekists complain. 
  In the FCS they predict that the bad example set by the 
authors of "Version No. 1" would be emulated by numerous 
"graphomaniacs with a political itch." Thus more "versions" may 
surface in the near future. The counterintelligence service 
vows to monitor closely the circumstances in which they come to 
see the light of day.

Financial-Industrial Groups Gets Moving"] 
  [Text] A session of the interdepartmental commission on 
the formation of financial-industrial groups chaired by First 
Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets has taken place in Moscow. One of 
the men behind the idea of the formation of financial-industrial 
groups in our country back in 1991 was Andrey Kokoshin, today's 
Russian Federation deputy defense minister. In a commentary for 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Andrey Kokoshin pointed out that given 
today's budget and financial crunch it is extremely important to 
create financial-industrial groups. They may ease the pressure 
on the federal budget. The establishment of 
financial-industrial groups is one of the necessary conditions 
for progress in capital investments in industry, for getting 
industry circulating capital from budget funds. The formation 
of financial-industrial groups as components of a market-based 
economy depends in the first place upon the enterprises of the 
defense complex which are becoming diversified. The most 
probable potentially powerful financial-industrial groups, in 
experts' assessment, are the Ilyushin Design Bureau and Voronezh 
Aviation Plant.

<F P=106> [INTERFAX report: "'The Fate of Such Documents Is Well </F>
Known'"] 
  [Text] According to Boris Nemtsov, governor of Nizhniy 
Novgorod (Volga Region), "it is naive to put one's trust in a 
memorandum of civil accord in Russia." 
  Commenting on Monday in an INTERFAX interview on the Russian 
leaders' statement on the need to prepare a memorandum, the 
Nizhniy Novgorod governor said in particular: "Maybe I am not 
on the right wavelength, but it seems to me it is a pointless 
exercise." 
  "We have had similar memorandums before," B. Nemtsov went 
on. 
"Many roundtables were held in the President Hotel (in Moscow) 
in Khasbulatov's time and a memorandum of accord between the 
Supreme Soviet and the government was adopted, but, 
unfortunately, the political fate of these documents is well 
known." According to the governor, the historical value of 
these documents is "nugatory, because they possess neither 
legal, nor any other status making them binding."

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin </F>
by Arkadiy Melkonyan at the airport in Sochi "prior to leaving" 
on 22 March -- from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Melkonyan] Tell us: You 
discussed the budget; what is the ruble's fate, this year at 
least? 
  [Chernomyrdin] I must tell you that we are not supporters of 
holding the ruble exchange rate, it -- I mean the dollar rate -- 
it must be realistic so that we do not crush our exporters. 
This we will not do. So, with regard to the budget, we have 
just submitted it. 
  [Melkonyan] But this year... 
  [Chernomyrdin, interrupting] We have submitted it to the 
Duma. We agreed it and worked on it before this. The talks 
today and yesterday were, I think my sixth set of talks with the 
president during which we stipulated everything: what is in the 
budget, what should be given the main emphasis, what we should 
not omit, where our main priorities lie. And so we finished 
such a budget today, submitted it, and I think that we will work 
with this Duma, with this Federation Assembly. We will work and 
not just wait for someone to do something or other. We will 
work.

  [Excerpt] The journalists accompanying Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin [during his visit to Maloyaroslavets] could not 
refrain from asking about both tomorrow's government sitting and 
yesterday's talks with the IMF. Chernomyrdin gave his forecast 
on the dollar exchange rate. In his view, the dollar will reach 
3,000 rubles by the end of the year. Moreover, Chernomyrdin 
said that the government does not intend to take, as he put it, 
uncivilized measures or to artificially curb the rise in the 
dollar exchange rate any more. Chernomyrdin stressed that there 
will be no further mass interventions. We will proceed in a 
normal and civilized manner. 
  Regarding the IMF talks, Chernomyrdin believes that the IMF 
has now supported the government's present policy and that there 
are no disagreements on the main parameters of the budget after 
yesterday's talks -- which, to remind you, ended late last 
night, after 2300. The agreed parameters are as follows: A 
monthly inflation rate of about seven percent by the end of the 
year; a federal budget deficit of about nine percent of the 
gross domestic product. 
  Lastly, replying to a question from journalists about 
tomorrow's government sitting, Chernomyrdin said that no changes 
would be made to the draft budget submitted to the Russian State 
Duma following the talks with the IMF. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina report on interview </F>
with Aleksandr Livshits, head of the Russian Federation 
president's group of experts, especially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; 
date, place not given: "What Is Needed Today Is Not New 
Superprograms but Political Will To Implement Our Own Decisions"] 
  [Text] The present economic situation is not unequivocally 
bad, although it is alarming, Aleksandr Livshits, head of the 
Russian president's group of experts, believes. "Despite the 
fact that a fall in production was predicted during the 
transition to the market, today it does not have any clearly 
expressed signs of a structure whereby individual sectors 
develop rapidly, while others wind down because they are no 
longer needed," the doctor of economic sciences noted in an 
interview with your ITAR-TASS observer. Nevertheless, he 
believes, the government is in a position to work efficiently 
without introducing any kind of emergency measures in the 
economy. 
  Responding to criticism from opponents, who see nothing new 
in the presidential message or the government program based on 
it, Aleksandr Livshits stressed: "I am convinced that it is not 
superprograms that are required of the government, but the 
implementation of commitments and its own decisions that have 
already been adopted." "Everyone who is now trying to propose a 
new program of action to the government is actually not wishing 
it well," the expert believes, "because what we need at the 
moment is not alternative ideas, but political will to perform 
the tasks facing us." 
  As for the presidential message, then, from what Aleksandr 
Livshits said, the publication of this document has made it 
possible to offer society a considered strategy of action, whose 
absence has been sharply felt since the beginning of the 
transition to the market. According to the expert, this is the 
basic innovation of the course. Second, the "innovation of the 
message, as an initiative proceeding from the president, lies in 
the fact that it proposes to plan a policy to track the price of 
reforms. This means that the period of ramming methods of 
reform is over and the period of considered actions is 
beginning," the leader of the group of experts noted. 
  Third, he went on, the economic section of the message has 
been met with "a moderately approbatory reaction by all 
political forces apart from those who want to privatize the 
entire economy within a month, or to reestablish the State 
Planning Committee and the State Committee for Material and 
Technical Supply in the same month." Thus, my interlocutor 
summed up, the president's message meets the expectations of the 
majority of society.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- "Russia has no plans to cut 
oil exports to foreign countries. No such plans have been made 
in the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy for the next few 
years either," Russian Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy 
Shafranik said. 
  In an interview with BUSINESS-TASS on Wednesday, Shafranik 
said that "the results from oil sales should cover the expenses. 
This is what the ministry has been guided by while holding 
consultations with its partners and OPEC and assessing the 
European Market." 
  OPEC, Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans 
to 
discuss at its session in Geneva on March 25 the possibility of 
a five-per cent cut in export quotas for member countries. If 
approved, Russia will be offered to cut its oil export by five 
per cent. 
  "The European market is saturated, but we will fight for 
it," 
Shafranik said. 
  Russia cannot transport all the oil extracted by joint 
ventures. Additionally, the ministry has many requests from 
Western partners for additional oil supplies. With this in 
mind, the ministry plans to suggest establishing a Baltic oil 
consortium in the Timano- Pechora region in order to penetrate 
the Baltic and Finnish oil markets. 
  The Russian oil industry also plans to expand operations to 
tap new oil deposits in the Irkutsk region, Kazakhstan, 
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Nigeria and boost 
activity in Vietnam where Russia extracts about 20 million 
tonnes of oil annually.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent A. Pishchayev, including </F>
recorded comment by Yuriy Shafranik, Russian minister for fuel 
and power engineering; from the "Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Shafranik] We think that in the actual fuel and 
energy crisis...[pauses] in the fuel complex, there is no crisis 
and never was. 
  [Pishchayev] That is how Yuriy Shafranik described the 
situation in the fuel and energy complex at a news conference at 
Government House. Incidentally, he pointed out that there was, 
nevertheless, a slump in production, but it was caused by a 
fall-off in demand. There was a general downturn in production 
in the country's industry in 1993 of up to 16 percent, but in 
the fuel and energy complex it was no higher than seven, 
although in other sectors of the national economy the slump was 
considerably higher. 
  In the minister's view, the main reason for the difficulty 
lay in the crisis of the financial system and in the insolvency 
of consumers. They owed the fuel and energy complex a total of 
some 16 trillion rubles. As in other sectors of the national 
economy, the way out of the situation is seen as being through 
the consumer's initiating direct ties with the producer and, in 
the actual fuel and energy complex, through assigning priority 
to payments for fuel and energy resources and strict sanctions 
against nonpayers. If the question of nonpayment were settled, 
Yuriy Shafranik remarked, the lowering of fuel prices would be 
guaranteed. 
  Trying to persuade journalists that everything was well in 
the fuel and energy complex, the minister announced that checks 
had been made into the financial activities of organizations, 
including Rosugol [Russia Coal], that make up the fuel and 
energy complex. No serious irregularities were found there.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry has compiled the state budget, 
which has been approved by the government, Sergey Dubinin, head 
of the ministry, has said. The budget will be submitted for 
consideration by the State Duma. Speaking about the situation 
in the financial sphere, the minister noted a slackening of the 
pace of inflation. In December, inflation amounted to 12 
percent a month, whereas in February, it was down to 10, and, in 
the first half of March, to four percent. According to Dubinin, 
since December, the country has been living in the conditions of 
positive interest rates, in accordance with the discount rate of 
the Central Bank and other credit institutions. Despite the 
deepening of the economic crisis, the first two months of the 
year were marked by some stabilization, the minister declared. 
  [Begin Dubinin recording] The financial stabilization which 
has been so much talked about is starting to turn into something 
real. [end recording] 
  On the subject of joint work with Michel Camdessus, managing 
director of the International Monetary Fund, Dubinin declared 
that it was the work of two highly professional teams, and the 
result was the provision of credit amounting to 1.5 billion 
dollars to balance the finances during the structural 
reorganization of the Russian economy. 
  [Begin Dubinin recording] Now we are already planning to use 
this credit as part of the cover for the federal budget deficit.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- The programme of voucher 
privatisation is the only Russian state programme which has been 
successfully implemented and which will be completed as 
scheduled," said Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the Russian 
Committee for State Property, at a news conference held to 
highlight the end of voucher privatisation scheduled in 100 days 
from now. 
  During the 100 days left before June 30, an officially 
declared deadline for voucher privatisation, around 200 major 
enterprises are expected to put their shares on sale at 
all-Russia voucher auctions. Another 4,500 auction sales will be 
held in regional auction centre. Chubays said that a few days 
ago the Russian Committee for State Property reached an 
agreement in principle with managers of the "Norilsk Nickel 
Concern" to put on sale a large package of shares belonging to 
this enterprise. 
  Chubays believes that by 1 July, 70 percent of Russian 
enterprises would have been privatised. Around 20 per cent of 
enterprises might be privatised according to a new scheme 
developed by the Russian State Property Committee. The concept 
of monetary privatisation will be submitted for a discussion to 
the State Duma on April 5. 
  Chubays said that after July 1, the State Property Committee 
will continue to control the activities of voucher investment 
foundations and protect the interests of their shareholders.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in 
Russian at 1725 GMT on 23 March carries in its "Details" program 
an interview with Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State 
Property Committee, by Nikolay Svanidze. Chubays explains the 
second stage of the privatization process, which is due to begin 
in 100 days. He says the main point of the process is that cash 
will take the place of vouchers. 
  Svanidze suggests to Chubays that he has many opponents and 
asks him who his supporters are. The main ones, Chubays says, 
are the president and the prime minister. In 1993, the volume 
of revenue from privatization amounted to 480,000 million 
rubles. Svanidze challenges Chubays on his popularity in 
parliament over the privatization process and queries the 
chances of his vision of privatization being endorsed by the 
Duma. Chubays says he is clear of one thing: If the Duma tries 
to derail this process, it will rebound on it. Finally, Chubays 
warns people to be on guard against swindlers making capital out 
of vouchers they have obtained by fraud.

<F P=106> [News conference by Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister </F>
and chairman of the State Committee for Management of State 
Property, on results of the voucher privatization in Moscow on 
23 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Chubays] As of today, under the privatization 
program, 15,000 large and very large industrial enterprises in 
Russia and more than 80,000 small enterprises comprising 70 
percent of the total number of small enterprises in Russia have 
been turned into joint-stock companies. 
  I can say that at present, more than half of the gross 
national product in Russia is produced outside the state sector. 
In the remaining 100 days, we will implement the unprecedented 
efforts that are already under way to put up into auction in the 
final stage of the voucher privatization of super-efficient and 
super-profitable Russian enterprises. According to our plan, 
the 12 million people in Russia who have not yet used their 
privatization vouchers will receive new opportunities to do this 
in the period before 30 June. 
  We plan to hold more than 4,500 regional voucher auctions in 
all Russian regions, with no exception. More than 200 
enterprises will be put into all-Russian voucher auctions before 
the end of June this year. 
  Moreover, and this is particularly important for us, we are 
talking here about unique enterprises well-known not only in 
Russia but also around the world. Among them are unique 
enterprises of the fuel and energy complex -- for example, a 
large program for privatization of oil enterprises. Whole 
groups of Lukoil enterprises will be put into voucher auctions 
in the next few months. And Lukoil is the largest oil producer 
in Russia, the fourth largest enterprise in Russia. [Word 
indistinct] Neftegaz, the Gazprom association, and the Berezka 
association will be put into voucher auctions before the end of 
the year. Large and efficient motor vehicle works, as well as 
many enterprises of the military-industrial complex, will be put 
into voucher auctions. 
  All this has become a reality today. And all this has been 
reflected in official documents, inter alia in documents, 
according to which, as many as 50 efficient enterprises will be 
put into voucher auctions in Moscow alone in the next one and a 
half or two months. I have signed an instruction that approves 
the schedule for holding these voucher auctions in the very near 
future. 
  There is yet another enterprise that will be sold at voucher 
auctions and that I simply must mention here. This is the 
largest Russian enterprise, the Norilsk Nickel concern. We have 
reached an understanding with the concern management that in the 
framework of the voucher privatization the major block of shares 
of Norilsk Nickel will be for sale in the open market for all 
citizens. I think there is no need to elaborate on Norilsk 
Nickel. Suffice it to say that in 1993 the volume of hard 
currency proceeds of this enterprise alone amounted to $1 
billion. Until very recently there has been nothing of the kind 
in the framework of the Russian privatization program. All this 
gives us grounds to say unequivocally and confidently that 
privatization has entered the home stretch and will be fully 
completed before 30 June. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reportby Valeriy Konovalov: "Food Suppliers Jack Up </F>
Prices. Cities Refuse Expensive Goods"] 
  [Text] The domestic food market has already reacted to the 
recent increase in import tariffs. In fact, there is no demand 
at the moment for the supply of food that is now much dearer and 
no one is in a hurry to conclude contracts on new terms. 
  At the Moscow government food resources department I was 
shown tenders for the supply of food from a number of Russian 
regions. The suppliers instantly assessed the situation that 
arose after the Russian Government introduced higher import 
tariffs and they immediately jacked up the prices of the 
products they supply. Above all we are talking about livestock 
products. For instance, Smolensk is prepared to supply the 
capital with 100 tonnes of butter at 3,700 rubles [R] per 
kilogram, and then another 50 tonnes, but this time at R4,200; 
Vologda named more or less the same prices, while Voronezh 
raised butter prices to R5,000. 
  The asking price of poultry has shot even higher -- 30 
percent above the average world level. And this depite the fact 
that unlike imported chickens, which have been drawn and wrapped 
in cellophane, our suppliers can only provide partly drawn 
chickens, which will not keep for long. 
  IZVESTIYA's own correspondents report that you find a 
similar 
situation in other Russian regions, with suppliers asking 
similar prices. But just as in Moscow, purchasing agents 
everywhere are in no hurry to buy food at those prices. 
Conclusion of contracts has been suspended everywhere. We can 
see why. 
  In the first place, as the city authorities told our 
correspondents, at these prices the structure of supply and 
demand is bound to change, since the population's ability to pay 
is limited, so there have to be major adjustments in purchasing 
levels. Second, there are substantial stocks of food everywhere 
-- in inflationary conditions purchasing agents try to make 
these stocks as secure as possible, so now there is no need to 
rush into new contracts. Finally, everyone is very confident 
that the president will cancel or at any rate amend the decree 
-- its adverse consequences for Russian consumers are too 
obvious.

submarines of the Northern Fleet collided on Wednesday in the 
Barents Sea while training joint manoeuvres and the press 
service of the Russian Navy qualified the incident as "a 
contact" of the U-boats. Nobody was injured, the armaments and 
equipment of the submarines is in proper order and the 
radioactive situation is normal, the press service said on 
Thursday adding that the subs returned to their base themselves. 
It was earlier reported that the "contact" resulted in 
inconsiderable damages which pose no danger to personnel and

  [Text] Today, the administration of Maritime Kray released 
a statement in which it said that dismantling and scrapping of 
atomic submarines is to be halted at the Zvezda yard at the 
settlement of Bolshoy Kamen. Discharge of liquid radioactive 
waste stored aboard the tanker DMT-5 into the Sea of Japan is 
also planned. The tanker is now in a dangerous condition. The 
radioactive waste poses a real threat to Vladivostok and a 
number of areas of Maritime Kray. That was a report from 
POSTFACTUM agency.

  [Text] The Russian armed forces have very great problems, 
being short of both staff and equipment, according to a 
so-called analysis of the surrounding world which the Swedish 
military intelligence and security service presented today. 
Exercises in the Russian armed forces have come to an almost 
total halt, says Colonel Erik Rosander. 
  [Begin recording] [Rosander] There is a very low degree of 
exercises in the units, a very small time set aside for pilots 
to fly, a low exercise capacity among naval units, but a high 
degree of exercises for the highest leadership organizations. 
Thus, the staff service is well trained but the units receive 
no training. 
  [Reporter] Can one talk about a tendency toward 
disintegration in the armed forces? 
  [Rosander] No, I don't think one should do that. But one 
could speak of a state of weakness owing to the lack of money 
and lack of personnel. 
  [Reporter] How long a period of armament do you reckon is 
necessary before Russian units can be deployed against a 
potential enemy outside the former USSR? 
  [Rosander] If they have the economic distribution which 
prevails at present, with 6-7 percent of GNP allocated to 
military defense, I would think that it will take a considerable 
time, and by that I mean in the 10-15-year perspective. But if 
there is reprioritization and, above all, if the economy can be 
put into shape, it may be quicker, of course. But the Swedish 
defense will always have very good advance warning before there 
may be any possible Russian threats. That is our assessment 
now. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] Last year, the Russian armed forces commanded 
more 
than 1.2 million men. That meant that they were 1 million 
soldiers short. Many units had no conscripts at all and in 
addition there was a shortage of young officers. The exception 
is the airborne troops who are still functioning as elite units. 
The report also notes that a militarily weakened Russia, which 
no longer has the capacity to counter external threats with 
conventioned armed forces, relies to a greater extent than 
before on strategic nuclear arms. 
  The current openness displayed by Russia makes it easier 
than 
before to gain reliable intelligence, says Erik Rosander. 
  [Begin recording] [Rosander] You can travel freely, you can 
move freely, you can visit ports, naval bases, even naval yards. 
As I have said before, you can even make a tourist trip to the 
Murmansk region which was unthinkable before the coup, or before 
the collapse. 
  [Reporter] Do you judge the information now available from 
open sources as credible? 
  [Rosander] On the whole, we think so. It corresponds well 
with the basic data we had before. One can draw analyses from 
the changes and try to assess the information. It is largely 
consistent. [end recording]

<F P=106> [SEGODNYA report under the "Army" rubric: "Andrey Kokoshin </F>
Criticizes Draft Budget"] 
  [Text] The results of financing the Defense Ministry in 
the first quarter, Andrey Kokoshin, Russian Federation first 
deputy defense minister, has said in an interview for SEGODNYA, 
show that the situation regarding budget revenues is getting 
steadily worse. Payments to the Defense Ministry are constantly 
being delayed. The government's debts to the suppliers of 
defense production and the military are growing all the time. 
At present, they stand at 3 trillion rubles. In 
February-March, 70 percent of servicemen did not receive their 
money allowances. If the current pattern of financing the 
industry, including defense enterprises, remains unchanged, 
there will be no hope to receive the revenues that are planned 
in the draft budget. 
  Approving the second-quarter budget in accordance with the 
estimates presented by the Finance Ministry, Mr. Kokoshin 
believes, would only exacerbate the critical situation regarding 
budget revenues; as a result, not only the Defense Ministry and 
the defense industry, but the entire budget sector of the 
Russian economy will disintegrate. 
  The Defense Ministry stands first of all for purposeful, 
joint efforts by the executive and legislative branches aimed at 
increasing the budget revenues. The government and the State 
Duma need to approve a list of emergency measures to lend 
substance to the budget's revenue part in a realistic fashion. 
In that regard Mr. Kokoshin thinks it necessary: to resolve 
the problems of enterprises' mutual debts by using commodities 
and financial bills of exchange; to make a one-time investment 
of money in the industry to restart the industries that have 
suspended production; and to pass legislation tightening 
punishment for tax evasion. 
  If these measures are taken everyone will be better off, 
including the Defense Ministry, Andrey Kokoshin said. If the 
current situation with regard to budget revenues is preserved, 
social turmoil and an irreparable collapse of the domestic 
industry are inevitable.

  [Text] Moscow March 24 ITAR-TASS -- "For the past twenty 
years our enterprise has specialized in manufacturing 
psychotronic devices for arms systems and control systems for 
intercontinental missiles and space vehicles," deputy director 
of a Russian defence enterprise told the Moscow News weekly. 
  Deputy director Martynov also said that his enterprise and 
another company, whose name he did not disclose, has began to 
produce a physical amplifier (metathrone) Miranda, developed on 
the basis of fundamental achievements in the field of 
psychotronics. 
  The weekly conducted an independent research, which revealed 
that work indeed had been done at the plant to produce 
metathrones, which are regarded as a side branch of psychotronic 
weapons. Such devices have long been used in the American 
industry to locate and establish the causes of any systemic 
failures. 
  The weekly cites specialists as saying that "on September 
24, 
1990 an agreement was signed between the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) of the United States and the KGB of the USSR on 
joint research in the field of psychotronics". 
  The weekly said however that cooperation in this field has 
not developed.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 23 -- Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime 
minister, today denied information that has appeared in the 
media that Russia has started the construction of a new 
cosmodrome in the Far East. "The matter was not discussed in 
the government," he said. "We are unable to ensure the normal 
functioning of the available launch pads, not to mention 
building a new one." 
  Yuriy Semenov, general designer of the "Energiya" 
scientific-industrial association, supported the position of the 
first deputy prime minister. He deeply believes that Russia, if 
it aspires to the status of a space power, will not be able to 
do without the Baykonur cosmodrome. In this connection, he 
described the current situation at Baykonur as catastrophic. 
The social sphere has not been provided, heating is not 
working, and people have not been paid wages for the previous 
month. Practically, he said, the whole thing runs entirely on 
people's enthusiasm. At the same time, one should be reminded 
of the fact that the cosmodrome that took 30 years to build is 
worth an estimated 13 trillion rubles, including worn out assets 
[at 1991 prices]. 
  If we do not start restoration work before April, we will 
soon lose Baykonur, he said. 
  Oleg Soskovets expressed confidence that at the upcoming 
meeting between Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev in Moscow 
they will adopt a political decision on the status and 
functioning of the Baykonur cosmodrome.

  [Text] Minsk March 23 TASS -- U.S. Defence Minister William 
Perry [title as received], who arrived in Belarus on a one-day 
official visit, met with the Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich on Wednesday [23 March].

we can resolve different problems and, primarily, the problem of 
disarmament," Kebich said during the talks with the U.S. defence 
minister. 
  For his part, Perry pointed out that the U.S. singled out

and without any preliminary conditions disposed of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The talks between Kebich and Perry were held behind closed 
doors. During the talks the sides discussed three main problems, 
including the U.S. Partnership for Peace initiative, the U.S.

  [Text] Minsk March 23 TASS -- U.S. Defense Minister [title 
as received] William Perry is taking with himself as a souvenir 
from Minsk a laser pointer which is capable of showing any spot 
at a considerable distance. William Perry received this present 
from a representative of the Belarussian Optical Mechanical 
Association (BELOMO) which is now mastering peace-time 
production. 
  The BELOMO together with the "Integral" association and the 
Association of Computing machinery, will cooperate with American 
firms in the field of conversion of the defense industry to 
peace-time production. 
  According to William Perry, the United States is prepared to 
earmark 10 million U.S. dollars to Belarus for the 
implementation of the conversion program. A special tender was 
carried out in the United States whose winners will cooperate 
with the three Belarussian production associations. 
  Now the United States is getting down to business, the U.S. 
defense minister said commenting on the signing of the 
conversion documents and the establishment of the joint 
American-Belarussian committee which will control conversion 
issues. 
  "We have been coming to this for almost two years," Defense 
Minister of Belarus Pavel Kozlovskiy noted. 
  The process of conversion will include three stages: The 
delivery of the latest equipment to Belarussian enterprises, the 
organization of production of modern products and the creation 
of an export market," representatives of the U.S. Defense 
Ministry told BELINFORM. 
  The fact that the United States have set aside 30 million 
U.S. dollars to Belarus, confirmed the words by Pavel Kozlovskiy 
that the "geographic remoteness and a different level of the 
economic development are not an obstacle to cooperation." 
  According to information received from high ranking 
officials 
of the Belarussian Defense Ministry, 10 million U.S. dollars 
will be spent on conversion, another 10 millions U.S. dollars -- 
on construction of houses for servicemen, 5 million U.S. dollars 
-- on the destruction of conventional weapons and the remaining 
5 million U.S. dollars -- on re-training of officer cadres of 
the Belarussian Army.

  [Text] Today in Minsk, Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel 
Kazlowski and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry signed the 
declaration: "On Principles of the Joint Committee for 
Conversion of the Enterprises of Defense Industries." The 
document is a result of the efforts undertaken by the Joint 
Committee for Conversion that held its session today, as well as 
of the cooperation between the two states in the military sphere 
over the last two years. The U.S. defense secretary announced 
the results of the bid for the best conversion project whose 
total cost will be $10 million. U.S. "Kras Corporation," 
"Raytheon Corporation," and "Byelocorp Scientific Incorporated" 
received the right to sign contracts with the Belarusian 
production amalgamations "Integral" and "Beloma." It was also 
pointed out that Belarus is the first CIS member whose relations 
with the United States in the field of conversion have brought 
about the signing of concrete contracts. It was announced that 
the U.S. Government had resolved to earmark $25 million for 
conversion in the Republic, for housing construction for 
Belarusian servicemen and for their retraining.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikhail Rutkowski] </F>
  [Excerpt] Businesslike friendly relations between the 
Republic of Belarus and the United States in the military sphere 
have been developing since 1992. Military specialists from the 
Belarusian and U.S. sides are discussing the primary directions 
of military cooperation, including such problems as conversion, 
control over exporting radioactive materials, training of 
servicemen, and creation of working groups for coordinating 
military cooperation. Today, the honored U.S. visitor [Defense 
Secretary Perry] was received by Belarusian Defense Minister 
Pavel Kazlowski and Council of Ministers Chairman Vyacheslav 
Kebich. In the afternoon, the defense secretary visited the 
Belarusian Supreme Soviet. During William Perry's visit, U.S. 
experts and managers of the largest industrial enterprises in 
Belarus worked on the issues of conversion. First Deputy 
Defense Minister Alyaksandr Tyshynski, leader of the working 
group's Belarusian team announced the results of the joint 
activities. 
  [Begin recording] [Tyshynski, in Russian] Esteemed U.S. 
Minister [as heard] Perry, esteemed Pavel Pavlavych [Kazlowski]! 
At today's meeting, we exchanged opinions on many aspects of 
cooperation. We heard detailed reports by Mr. Barry Carter and 
Mr. Pugachev, who is chief of the Defense Ministry 
Scientific-Technical Committee. To many questions asked by the 
representatives of industries.... [pauses] Today, one-third of 
the largest enterprises are present here, those at which 
conversion is beginning. Those are the Belarusian optics and 
mechanical amalgamation Belomo headed by General Manager Hurski, 
the production amalgamation of computing equipment headed by 
General Manager Kharlap, and the production amalgamation 
Integral headed by its Chief Engineer Kaloshin. We heard short 
reports and answers to many questions asked by [words 
indistinct] enterprises. It was interesting for the Belarusian 
side to hear about the possibilities for expanding cooperation 
in many other directions (?including) the Nunn-Lugar direction. 
It would now be very important and appropriate to form a 
committee for the conversion of defense industries that would 
accelerate the implementation of those projects that have been 
set up almost two years ago and will enable expansion of 
conversion of [word indistinct] enterprises. Let me give the 
floor to Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Pavlavych Kazlowski. 
  [Kazlowski, in Russian] Esteemed defense minister, 
gentlemen. I am happy to realize that between the Republic of 
Belarus and the United States, between our armies and nations 
stable businesslike relations are developing. The declaration 
which we are going to sign on the principles of the Joint 
Committee for Conversion of the Enterprises of Defense 
Industries confirms the mutual [word indistinct] striving of the 
sides for peace, and orienting the defense complex toward the 
needs of a civilian society. The problems of conversion are 
just one of the components of the developing cooperation, and 
today, we talked about many elements of this cooperation. This 
is a demonstration of peaceful trends inherent in our state. 
The rather high activity of meetings and negotiations at 
different levels between the Ministries of Defense is a 
demonstration of mutual interest, necessity, and the long-range 
nature of our relations. In its domestic policy, Belarus has 
chosen the path of social peace and accord, and the development 
of human rights and freedoms. Their priority character has been 
certified by our Republic's legal acts. Belarus has proclaimed 
its non-nuclear status, its striving to become a neutral state, 
and is continuously and unconditionally observing its 
commitments. We are grateful to you, Mr. Minister for your 
understanding of the problems of the Belarusian people, your 
readiness to cooperate and assistance in [words indistinct]. I 
would like you to pass our best wishes of wealth, happiness, and 
prosperity to the people and the President of the United States. 
[end recording] 
  The ceremony of signing the agreement on principles of the 
joint committee for conversion has started. The floor was then 
given to U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. [passage omitted]

headed by Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the council's committee 
for budget matters; finance, currency, and credit regulations; 
currency emissions, tax policy, and custom regulations. The

Soviet, on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems. 
  At a news conference, which was held immediately after the 
talks at the Councils of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet, it 
was emphasized that mutual understanding of both sides was 
achieved in every aspect. There all grounds to believe that the 
important document will be signed soon. By the way, this 
document should be discussed by the deputies of the Russian 
State Duma tomorrow. At this very moment, the Russian 
delegation is meeting with people's deputies of the Belarusian 
Supreme Soviet.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Glod and Larisa </F>
Lazar: "Belarus: Who Will Be First President"] 
  [Text] After the Belarus Supreme Soviet approved the 
decision of the comptroller's commission on the results of the 
deputies' vote on the section of the new draft constitution 
providing for the introduction of the institution of the 
presidency, no one doubts any longer the fact of the replacement 
of the republic's state structure. It is true that the draft of 
the new constitution as a whole still has to be adopted. But 
everyone understands very well that this is only a formality. 
  Moreover, it is already known when it will be feasible to 
hold nationwide elections of the first president. The deputies 
cite the very earliest date -- 26 July this year. The first 
president will have great powers. He is the head of state and 
of executive power. 
  Already there are disputes in full swing in the 
parliamentary 
corridors over the figure of the future president. By law a 
candidate president can be nominated only by at least 70 
people's deputies or at least 100,000 voters through the 
collection of signatures. Political parties and associations do 
not have this right. But the most influential political forces 
will find the opportunity to use either the former or the latter 
option. 
  The disposition of political forces in Belarus is now as 
follows. At one extreme is the People's Movement of Belarus 
[PMB] and at the other the Belarusian National Front [BNF]. And 
between them is the "Spring-94" association. So far there is 
only total clarity about the BNF. This organization is gambling 
on its undisputed leader Zenon Poznyak. The PMB -- the most 
mass-based movement -- has still not found its bearings. 
Perhaps it will support the present premier, Vyacheslav Kebich, 
perhaps Aleksandr Lukashenko, who made a name for himself in the 
post of chairman of the Supreme Soviet anticorruption commission. 
  The scenario whereby the Belarus Party of Communists, which 
is a collective member of the PMB, will nominate its own 
candidate, Viktor Chikin. As for the democratic-centrist 
"Spring-94" bloc, it could launch an election campaign in favor 
either of Stanislav Shushkevich or Gennadiy Karpenko. 
  The Belarus Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology has 
already conducted the first poll of rural inhabitants. Of those 
polled 20.8 percent stated they would vote for Aleksandr 
Lukashenko. So far he is the obvious leader in the countryside. 
This deputy's rating rose sharply after his speeches in the 
Supreme Soviet exposing corruption. By creating the image of a 
fighter against the mafia, Aleksandr Lukashenko has been a 
crowd-pleaser, as they say, stating that the mafia and its 
patrons are to blame for everything. 
  It is true that so far the only result of his commission's 
work has been the dismissal of Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav 
Shushkevich, toward whom Lukashenko had a personal antipathy 
which he did not hide. But the fighter against the mafia, as he 
himself has stated, has a file on two dozen top officials from 
the Council of Ministers and structures directly subordinate to 
the government. Naturally, having made these facts public 
Aleksandr Lukashenko will undoubtedly gain additional points in 
the fight for the president's seat. 
  Stanislav Shushkevich and Vyacheslav Kebich are almost 
equally popular among rural inhabitants. Today 9.3 percent of 
those polled are prepared to vote for the former and 8.1 percent 
for the latter. It is true that the head of government has gone 
for broke, gambling on the unification of the monetary systems 
of Belarus and Russia. If the union of this two slav countries 
succeed, the moderate politician will of course be riding high. 
If not then perhaps only a miracle will save the premier. 
  Zenon Poznyak was ranked fourth with 6.1 percent by the 
Belarusian peasants in their unique popularity rating. But the 
BNF leader's recent political actions -- his statements about 
wanting Belarus to withdraw from the CIS, his charges of 
imperialism against the Russians, and the ban on professions -- 
will hardly give him any chance of success. Gennadiy Karpenko, 
the leader of the Party of National Accord, which is something 
like the Russian "Civic Union," and Viktor Chikin close the list 
of contenders, with scarcely more than 1 percent of those polled 
supporting them. 
  Of course, these are only the first reports and they will 
change with time. It is not ruled out that other contenders 
could join in the struggle for the president's seat on the crest 
of the wave of general dissatisfaction and lack of confidence in 
the authorities. But the overwhelming majority of political 
scientists today believe that the real struggle will develop 
only between three candidates: Vyacheslav Kebich, Aleksandr 
Lukashenko, and Stanislav Shushkevich. 
<H5>  Meanwhile.... </H5>
  Zenon Poznyak, the leader of the parliamentary opposition, 
stated that the introduction of the post of president in Belarus 
is one stage in establishing an authoritarian regime and 
restoring in full the previous power and previous relations. 
"The draft law on the election of the Belarus president is 
compiled in such a way that only one candidate could be 
nominated -- Kebich. In practice not a single candidate can be 
nominated at the Supreme Soviet and not a single one can be 
nominated from the people -- according to the draft law. 
Because at the Supreme Soviet to nominate a candidate you must 
collect 70 signatures (it is virtually ruled out that any deputy 
other than Kebich would collect as many). As for signatures 
from the people, it is proposed that 100,000 should be collected 
in only two weeks. Considering the procedure which is proposed 
it is in practice impossible to collect signatures in that time." 
  Nonetheless the BNF council has examined the question of the 
development of the political situation and the prospects of 
elections in Belarus. BNF leaders believe that their 
organization has real chances of success but only under 
conditions where voters are faced with a tough choice: either a 
representative of the opposition or a representative of the old 
nomenklatura. In their opinion a third candidate and third way 
are a threat. Zenon Poznyak said that Stanislav Shushkevich 
specifically presents a threat to the BNF's prospects. "There 
cannot be a third way," Poznyak said, "either for independence 
or against it." The front will no longer support Shushkevich 
and it is highly likely it will campaign against it.

  [Text] According to BELAPAN, the coordinating committee of 
the Democratic Forces Association Spring-94 has passed a 
resolution on granting support to candidates in the upcoming 
presidential elections in Belarus. It has also been decided to 
form an organizing committee to collect the necessary signatures 
to nominate Stanislav Shushkevich as candidate for Belarusian 
president. The forming of the committee is expected to be 
completed by the end of this week. Not a single member of 
Spring-94 attending the session of the organizing committee, 
opposed Stanislav Shushkevich's candidacy. As of 22 March, the 
Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the United Democratic 
Party, the Confederation of Labor, and the Independent Trade 
Union have pledged support for Shushkevich. The National 
Movement for Territorial Self-Rule and the Belarusian 
Entrepreneurs' Association are ready to support Stanislav 
Shushkevich, along with other democratic candidates. 
  Viktar Ivashkevich, secretary of the Belarusian Popular 
Front 
Headquarters, who was a guest at the session, spoke in favor of 
civilized cooperation within the framework of the democratic 
movement, and for correct behavior during the collection of 
signatures and the election campaign. Coordinating committee 
members agreed that these conditions should characterize the 
election campaigns of democratic organizations.

Plant?"] 
  [Text] The agreement between Belarus and Russia on an 
integrated ruble zone may be signed as soon as this month. This 
is what Belarusian Prime Minister V. Kebich stated in 
Baranovichi at his meeting with representatives of local 
authorities from Brest and Minsk Oblasts. 
  According to the prime minister, Belarus and Russia have 
also 
reached an agreement on gas prices. Fuel delivered to Belarus 
as of 1 January 1994 has become almost 40 percent cheaper. This 
has enabled Belarus to repay a large part of its gas debt to 
Russia. 
  At the same time, V. Kebich admitted that Belarus would have 
to remember nuclear energy, because it had no other alternative 
in the visible future. Currently, work on the selection of a 
site for a future nuclear power plant is under way, in line with 
international norms.

<F P=106> [Cristian Nita dispatch from Chisinau] </F>
  [Text] According to Dniester Radio, in Tiraspol, by a 
decree issued by [Dniester President] Igor Smirnov, the 
Committee for the Republic's Security was set up of the 
presidency of the [self-styled] Dniester Moldovan Republic. As 
a justification for the re-establishment of that coercing body, 
the decree says: The Committee was set up in order to stabilize 
the crime situation; the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry 
of Security will be subordinated to it. 
  Former Security Minister Shevtsov [name as heard] was 
appointed head of the new body. The interior minister of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Moldovan Republic, as well as his 
deputy, were relieved of their offices and are now standing at 
the disposal of the republic's president. 
  The decree became effective immediately after it was signed, 
that is, last night, and it orders the new body to elaborate, by 
1 May, a plan to fight organized crime. 
  A commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova assesses that such 
reshuffles made by Igor Smirnov are merely further attempts to 
save the discredited authority of the Dniester leaders and as a 
method to eliminate the persons they find disagreeable and to 
mislead public opinion making it believe that decisive measures 
are being taken to fight crime. In reality the latest 
reorganization is the implementation of the directions given to 
them by the Russian opposition forces, which use the Dniester 
Region for trying their hand at the reestablishment of the 
Stalinist and Brezhnevist regimes, an attempt made to liquidate 
the opposition, and a concerted effort to deal a blow at their 
opponent, General [Aleksandr] Lebed [commander of the 14th 
Russian Army stationed in the Dniester Region], concludes the 
commentary broadcast by Radio Moldova.

  [Text] Dear listeners, we now report on the latest 
incidents on the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] front line and 
on the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
  The latest reports from the NKR confirm that Azerbaijan is 
not interested in the effort to resolve the confrontation 
through peaceful talks. Several observers are convinced that 
Azerbaijan's leaders have used the relatively peaceful situation 
to prepare for new and large-scale attacks. The NKR Defense 
Headquarters has revealed that Azerbaijan's military command is 
massing large units and armored vehicles in areas near the front 
line to reinforce its positions. Not satisfied with that, 
Azerbaijan's military forces have continued to systematically 
fire on NKR positions with various kinds of arms and to launch 
attacks to establish whether the Armenians have strengthened 
their defense lines. But they have been confronted with 
counterattacks and forced to retreat after suffering many 
casualties and losing military equipment. 
  Azerbaijan's military forces in Fizulinskiy Rayon attacked 
the NKR defense positions in the east of the rayon center at 
0745 yesterday. A wave of rocket and artillery fire preceded 
the attack. The advancing units were supported by 10 tanks and 
three infantry combat vehicles. There were casualties on both 
sides. 
  The NKR defense forces obstructed the onslaught but also 
counterattacked in the afternoon. The defense forces succeeded 
in occupying four heights near Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon at 
about 1630. The fighting is continuing in that area. 
Azerbaijan has used its Air Force units again. 
  The NKR Defense Army Information Service has reported that 
the Armenian freedom fighters recaptured two important heights 
in the Omar Pass last night. The heights were occupied by the 
enemy forces several days ago. The Armenian fighters have 
placed the Omar Pass under their control. 
  No change has occurred elsewhere on the NKR's front line. 
The confrontation is mainly in the form of positional fighting. 
The Artsakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] people are trying to silence 
Azerbaijan's positions, which are firing on them with various 
types of arms. 
  The Armenian Defense Ministry Information Service has 
revealed that the relatively peaceful situation on the border 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan has been disrupted. One of 
Azerbaijan's T-72 tanks has fired on the defense positions in 
Tavushskiy Rayon. The Armenian border guards launched 
retaliatory operations. No other incident occurred anywhere 
else in the border area last night or this morning. But the 
situation is tense.

  [Text] Yerevan March 23 TASS -- "According to preliminary 
data, the Iranian C-130 military transportation plane had no 
technical malfunction. It strayed off course and exploded in 
mid-air last Saturday due to unknown causes," Adbat Aminian, 
head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's legal department, told 
ITAR-TASS here. 
  Mr. Aminian leads an official Iranian commission taking part 
in the investigation of the circumstances of the crash of the 
Iranian in Nagorno-Karabakh. [sentence as received] 
  Iranian civil aviation and air force experts are now at the 
site of the crash near Stepanakert. Conclusions are to be drawn 
after they return from there and analyse the collected data, the 
diplomat said. 
  "The flight was not of reconnaissance nature and the C-130 
plane had no photographic equipment," the Iranian spokesman 
emphasised. "The plane carried members of the families of 
Iranian diplomats who work in Moscow and several Iranian 
students. Regular flights from Moscow to Tehran are made once a 
week. Therefore they decided to take the plane to fly home for 
lunar new year's holidays." 
  According to the diplomat, the authorities of Russia, 
Georgia, and Armenia were notified in advance about the flight, 
and issued appropriate permissions. 
  "We requested the Armenian authorities to provide the 
recording of radio traffic between the Yerevan air traffic 
controllers and the Russian airliner on a flight from Sharja to 
Mineralnyye Vody, via which contact was maintained with the 
Iranian plane in question," the Iranian spokesman said. 
  "We hope that the Armenian side will comply with regulations 
provided for by international law and investigate all the 
circumstances of the tragedy," the Iranian diplomat said.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- The Armenian party will pay 
costs of putting the republic's nuclear power plant back into 
action in full, said Nikolay Yegorov, Russian deputy minister of 
nuclear power industry. 
  Armenia would like to finish the recovery by the end of 
1994, 
but it is premature to talk about deadlines at present, because 
the experts have yet to estimate the work to be done and 
determine what additional equipment should be brought to the 
plant. According to the deputy minister, it is impossible at the 
moment to estimate how much it will cost to resume operations at 
the plant in accordance with the relevant Russo-Armenian 
agreement, which Oleg Soskovets, Russian first vice-premier, and 
Grant Bagratyan, Armenian prime minister, signed on March 17.

  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- The Iranian plane which 
exploded over Nagorno-Karabakh in mid-air several days ago, was 
downed by an Osa-type homing missile, claims a reporter of the 
Moscow-based TRUD newspaper in Baku, referring to Azeri sources. 
The article printed on Thursday says that materials connected 
with the crash were handed over by Azerbaijan to the Iranian 
side. 
  Commenting on this allegation at TRUD's request, the head of 
the Armenian mission in Moscow said that the Azeri statement 
"can be explained only by political aims". Iranian, Russian and 
Armenian commissions are working at the place of the crash, and 
they have not drawn any conclusion concerning reasons for the 
crash.

  [Text] Units of the Azeri national army, on March 23, 
following the night's lull, resumed attacks on the Karabakh 
positions to the east of the Azeri center of Fizuli, Interfax 
was told by a spokesman of the defense army of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  The spokesman said that the Azeris are trying to return the 
heights near the Alkhanly settlement they lost during the 
hostilities on Tuesday. According to the information at midday, 
Karabakh fighters are retaining their positions inflicting 
tangible casualties on the enemy. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Azeri Defense Ministry, 
reported that Armenian forces which had launched an offensive 
near the Alkhanly Village were forced later in the day to 
retreat to their initial positions. The spokesman said that 
during the fighting Armenians lost about 10 soldiers and two 
artillery units. Several servicemen were wounded on the Azeri 
side. 
  A reliable source in the Azeri Defense Ministry told 
Interfax 
that in the morning of March 23 Karabakh forces launched an 
offensive against the strategic railroad station Goradiz 
situated not far from the Azeri-Iranian border. The source said 
over the past two days the Armenians lost in that direction over 
one hundred fighters, two tanks, three armored personnel 
carriers and two trucks. 
  Baku said that in the early hours of March 23 that guns 
situated in the military bases in the Berdskiy District in 
Armenia fired at border villages of the Tauzskiy District of 
Azerbaijan. 
  A spokesman for the Armenian Defense Ministry told Interfax 
that following several days of lull at the Armenian-Azeri border 
Azeri troops again shelled the area of the Armenian border. For 
example, near 22:00 on March 22 an Azeri tank T-72 fired at the 
Armenian positions near the Chinari Village of Armenia. No 
casualties were reported. Armenian forces did not open return 
fire.

  [Text] Baku (March 22) TURAN -- Today the talks between 
State Oil Company of Azerbaijan [SOCAR] and the consortium of 
Western oil companies on development of Caspian oil-fields 
resumed. The talks were broken in December, 1993 when SOCAR 
rejected the draft of the agreement prepared by Manafov's group 
of independent experts. 
  The same month the Consortium rejected the variant of the 
draft of SOCAR due to unfavourable conditions. The Western 
companies were surprised that Azerbaijan rejected Manafov's 
draft since he is official representative of Azeri government. 
On February 4 President Aliyev ordered SOCAR to work out a new 
variant. 
  Last week President of Russian Oil Company Lukoil, Vahid 
Alekperov, signed the agreement in Baku. Under the agreement 
his Company will get the share of 10 per cent. Lukoil will get 
one third of Azeri oil which amounts to 80 per cent of the whole 
extracted oil. As is known, total reserves of oil in Chirag and 
Azeri fields amount to 450 million tons. 
  According to experts, since world prices for oil decreased, 
the consortium will try to achieve advantageous conditions in 
the contract. Western companies intend to change the world 
price for oil which presently totals $18 for 1 barrel. In the 
nearest future Azerbaijan will have to pay a great volume of oil 
for Western investments. It means that the share of the 
Consortium will change from 20 to 23 per cent and the share of 
Azerbaijan in the contract will decrease.

the Russian People!'"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] Will the referendum be held? 
  [Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March. 
  [KURIER] But President Kravchuk has vetoed it.... 
  [Meshkov] We are aware of that. 
  [KURIER] What would happen if Kravchuk were to impose a 
state of emergency after the vote? 
  [Meshkov] Then I would have to feel sorry for the work of 
his unprofessional advisers. I abide by the Crimean 
constitution and what goes beyond it -- namely the desire of the 
citizens. 
  [KURIER] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy? 
  [Meshkov] Zhirinovskiy is a highly talented man. He is much 
more serious than one would gather from his behavior toward the 
press. He is the only person in the Duma who expresses the 
needs of this huge people. 
  [KURIER] What help do you expect from Russia? 
  [Meshkov] No state can survive without outside help. We 
want to overcome isolation. If this is the only way out then we 
will opt for it. Russia has never tried to avoid supporting us 
-- which used to be normal, while now this support has been 
artificially restricted. 
  [KURIER] Why do you want to integrate the Crimea into the 
ruble zone? 
  [Meshkov] It is my duty to do the best for the Crimea. It 
is not the fault of the Ukrainian laws that we have been 
maneuvered into this disastrous situation. We must protect 
ourselves against Ukrainian inflation destroying the economy of 
the Crimea. 
  [KURIER] Will there be war in the Crimea as in the former 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Meshkov] You cannot compare them. Here there are no 
nationality or religious conflicts. We have always been part of 
the Russian people -- and we are part of it today.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Bachun, Viktor Demidenko </F>
for TASS] 
  [Text] Lvov March 23 TASS -- "We are learning not to fight, 
but to defend ourselves. The Ukrainian Armed Forces will never 
be the first to take a step which might lead to a conflict," 
said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at a new conference 
held on the Javor military training grounds of the Carpathians 
Military District on Wednesday [23 March]. 
  Kravchuk pointed out that Ukraine would not grudge funds for 
the Ukrainian Army and will do its best to strengthen it defence 
might, create a modern material and technical base and train 
highly-qualified personnel. [sentence as received] Special 
attention will be paid to the welfare of the Ukrainian 
servicemen and their families, the Ukrainian president said. 
At present, the Ukrainian Army is being provided with 
equipment predominantly produced in Ukraine. "At the same time, 
we are disposing of lethal weapons - nuclear rockets," the 
Ukrainian president said. 
  In this connection, he highly assessed the results of a 
recent visit to Ukraine by the U.S. Defence Secretary William 
Perry. It was announced that the U.S. had allocated additional 
funds for the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 
  Speaking about relations between Ukraine and the Crimea, 
Kravchuk said that the Ukrainian state was pursuing a policy in 
accordance with its constitution and other legislative acts. 
The Crimea can have neither army of its own, nor any other 
military formations, the president said the Crimean Peninsula, 
as any other territory of the country, shall be defended by the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces, the added. 
  Touching upon the upcoming elections to the Ukrainian 
parliament, Kravchuk pointed our that the elections would be 
held in any case and that there is no other alternative. The 
problem is that it might take more time than scheduled. The 
country must not be left without the legislative power. It is 
the new parliament which will have to adopt laws on power 
structures, including local bodies of power. Ukraine will not 
be able to continue its development as an independent and 
economically strong state without these fundamental documents, 
and it is with these documents that the Ukrainian president 
connects his participation in the early presidential elections.

for the debts it owes for oil and gas deliveries. This was 
stated in an interview with foreign journalists by Volodymyr

the document signed by the two presidents in Massandra last 
September is not an agreement, merely a protocol of intent. 
According to V. Bezkorovaynyy, this issue was studied but was 
rejected. Both sides have agreed to set up a commission to take 
an inventory of the ships and other Black Sea Fleet property 
with a view to dividing it up.

<F P=106> [Ye. Degtyarev report on meeting with electorate of </F>
Kiyevskiy Rayon by acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Ye.L. 
Zvyahilskyy; date not given: "The Business of Both Prime 
Minister and Deputy"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday, acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Ye.L. 
Zvyahilskyy reported to the electorate of Kiyevskiy Rayon in 
Donetsk on his deputy activity in the Supreme Council. 
  The deputy counts to his credit dozens of problems resolved 
with his assistance in the rayon and the city--from deliveries 
of crushed stone for road repair to the construction of housing, 
new trolley buses, and the beginning of actual construction on 
the metro. 
  Zvyahilskyy considers one of the main results of his 
activity 
in the position of acting prime minister to be surmounting the 
energy crisis in Ukraine. The preconditions have been 
established for price stabilization of products. "This averted 
a new price hike in January. For this they call me a suppressor 
of reforms." Inflation in January and February ran at 20 
percent. In March it is expected to reach 30 percent. 
Zvyahilskyy stated that not a single state has managed without 
administrative measures. He points out the establishment of 
relations with CIS countries as one of his achievements of 
merit. A number of positive shifts are seen as a consequence of 
this--from the opening in Moscow of the Ukraine bank to the 
production of drugs and medicines. Ukraine will have its own 
insulin. Anticancer medicinal preparations will be produced in 
Lugansk Oblast. 
  After presenting a half-hour report, Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy 
responded to questions from Donetsk citizens. 
  [Question] Will there be new price increases? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Today the government is undertaking all 
measures to see to it that prices not only do not increase but 
actually begin to be systematically reduced. The Zaporozhye 
"Tavriya" is incredibly priced. If "trade mark-up of up to 50 
percent" appears in writing, they establish it at exactly 50 
percent. Now there will be a trade mark-up of up to 10 percent. 
The plant will decide this. The government will lower excise 
taxes in response. 
  [Question] How do you assess the way banks are operating? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Almost all Ukrainian banks are commercial 
banks, with the exception of one established for hard currency 
transactions. A few days ago I signed a document according to 
which all plants will conduct hard currency transactions through 
this bank. There will be a scandal, of course. Commercial 
banks have destroyed the financial system. It was recently 
discovered that the salaries of certain bank managers comes to 
187-185 million a month. A resolution was adopted to make 
salaries over 6 million subject to tax at 90 percent. The 
Ministry of Internal Affairs is now monitoring time frames for 
payment processing. 
  [Question] How do you view commercial drugstores? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] That is not business--selling drugs and 
medicines to the populace for currency. Investments in medical 
industrial equipment and joint enterprises for the production of 
medicines was one of the first questions to be discussed in 
meetings with the ambassadors of foreign states. In 1995-1996 
we will have a complete industrial base. But it is impossible 
to shut down the drug stores right now since there is no market 
saturation with respect to medicines. 
  [Question] Will the hryvnya be introduced, and when? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] A plant has already been built in Ukraine for 
producing money. On Friday (i.e., today--Ye.D.) I will attend 
the ribbon-cutting ceremony along with Kravchuk and Plyushch. I 
have seen the new hryvnya. The hryvnya we have is better than 
the one from Canada. Its security features are even better. 
When? Let us say, this will happen Thursday, but in what... 
  [Question] The salaries of medical personnel and teachers 
are low. There is no money for pay or meals in the military 
units. 
  [Zvyahilskyy] Some 1.5 trillion [rubles] has already gone 
into pension payments for military pensioners. Five hundred 
billion--to grants for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 100 
billion--to border troops. When the economy gets adjusted a bit 
more, the question of salaries for medical personnel and 
teachers will be examined in the Supreme Council. Their 
salaries should be on the level of the average in industry. 
Today for mine workers at mines that are meeting quotas it is 4 
million, for metallurgists--3 million, energy industry 
workers--3.5 million karbovantsy. This is not very much, of 
course. The state does not have such salaries for doctors and 
teachers. There is simply nowhere to get the money. 
  [Question] How do you assess Kravchuk's purchase of a 
"bungalow" in Switzerland when our people are impoverished? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I have not been to Switzerland and have not 
seen this "bungalow." But I do know Kravchuk. I talk with him. 
He is a versatile politician. 
  [Question] What do you have to say about corruption in the 
upper echelons of power, including in your government? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I have not noticed any violations at present 
on the part of deputy prime ministers or ministers. Also, my 
personal signature alone does not suffice for any document. The 
endorsements of all deputy prime ministers and legal counsel 
must appear. I do not permit deputy prime ministers to go 
abroad. There is a great deal to do at home. 
  [Question] Why do we see the highest prices for products in 
Donetsk and in the oblast? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] We must get involved in prices and price 
formation. I was in Kirovskiy on 8 March (in connection with a 
mine accident). I made a special trip to the store and found 
that butter was being sold there for 83,000. I asked--where did 
they come up with such a price? It turns out they got the 
butter through the canteen, with a mark-up. But butter is just 
sitting at the warehouses today--tens of thousands of tonnes, 
because people will not take it at that price. Lower the 
price--I said. The price of butter should be 50,000-55,000. I 
talked with V.V. Rybak by phone and asked him how things were 
going. He said he had just returned from the oblast executive 
committee where they decided to raise the price of bread 
one-and-a-half times. So I asked Minister of Agriculture 
Demyanov to see me. We looked into it and took this question 
off the agenda. 
  [Question] How do you view a federative land structuring of 
Ukraine? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I support independence. I am in favor of a 
bilingual system. There need not be any coercion over language. 
  [Question] Will there be a liberalization of prices? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] All the problems of the economy in Ukraine 
stem from three factors. Liberalization of prices, oil 
products, and the export of metals--which is taking place 
outside state control. I am therefore today an opponent of 
price liberalization. 
  [Question] When will children's footwear appear in the 
stores? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] We will have children's footwear. We have a 
mighty shoe industry, with new equipment. But 16 million hides 
were exported out of Ukraine last year. What do you use to make 
shoes? The Donetsk shoe factory must produce children's footwear. 
  [Question] What is your income and how well off is your 
family? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] I have been working all my life, 37 years. I 
spent 26 of these years as top manager in the mines. That must 
mean something. Today my income is on the order of 4 million a 
month. My wife is on pension. Our children live independently. 
I am a rich man, for your information. 
  [Question] Will there be indexation of deposits of the 
population? 
  [Zvyahilskyy] There is no money for this. Ukraine needs 70 
trillion in order to fully implement indexation. We can do this 
in phases, by age: 85-80, then 80-75, and so on down to 60. 
That will do it. I had a conversation with Kravchuk on this 
topic. We hope the United States Congress will provide--in 
addition to that $700 million you are aware of--more credits for 
1994-1996, for 10 years. Perhaps we will allot a portion of that 
for indexation.

<F P=106> [Interview with M.G. Pabat by S. Gurova; place and date not </F>
given: "Oblast Budget Adopted. Can We Breathe Easier?"] 
  [Text] On 15 March a Session of the Oblast Soviet 
Voted for One of the Year's Main Issues 
  Budget questions are questions of our life. Much 
depends on the figures for which the deputies vote: whether we 
can receive treatment and be taught at the level of the 
individual of the end of the 20th century, ride urban mass 
transit, and move, as needed, into new residential 
neighborhoods. At the oblast soviet session on 22 February the 
deputies rejected the draft budget. And now a new attempt. This 
time the decision was adopted. Our correspondent's questions are 
answered by M.G. Pabat, chief of the oblast state administration 
financial department. 
  [Gurova] Mikhail Grigoryevich, the second version of the 
budget is better? 
  [Pabat] Substantially. The amount--10.3 trillion 
karbovantsy--that the deputies rejected on the last occasion 
would hardly have been sufficient to cater to half our 
requirements. In order to fully cover the requirements of 
housing and public utilities and for there to be sufficient 
funds for the purchase of prescription drugs, for transport 
subsidies, and for other needs, the deputies proposed an 
increase in the amount by a factor of 1.7. Which also will not 
be enough for everything, of course, but we will not have to 
accustom ourselves to shortages. 
  [Gurova] From where, for all that, has the increase in funds 
come? 
  [Pabat] From a reduction in tax payments to the state 
coffers. Having transferred them to the local budget, the 
deputies thereby ran counter to current legislation. But they 
had no choice. When there is not enough to maintain the 
hospitals and schools, to maintain electric transportation in at 
least some kind of shape, not to mention replacing it, or to 
prevent the poor from dying of starvation and to provide them 
with a roof over their heads, under these circumstances one does 
not point to the strict pressure of the law. After all, on the 
other side there is the abyss into which poverty is pushing us. 
  [Gurova] Will these percentages which were withheld from the 
state budget help us to breathe easier? 
  [Pabat] Alas! The budget is composed of taxes, and where are 
they to come from if the plants and factories come to a halt? In 
January the oblast produced 34 percent less than in the same 
month last year. In February the minus increased to 41 percent. 
In March it is expected that this figure will be even higher. We 
will breathe more easily only when an upturn in production 
begins. 
  [Gurova] What was the subject most discussed when the budget 
was being adopted? 
  [Pabat] The talk was mostly about social protection, about 
the pay of employees of the publicly funded sphere. Whatever 
matter was raised--whether there was a reserve fund, the 
construction of housing, or the Afghan veterans--the talk 
continually came back to the calamitous position of the 
hospitals, schools, and higher educational institutions and, 
consequently, the doctors, teachers, and lecturers--those on 
whom the health, intellect, and spiritual condition of the 
people depend. Despite the fact that the payments to them come 
not from the local but the state budget, the session still had 
to decide questions on an increase in pay from general 
appropriations until the corresponding decrees are adopted at 
the state level.

Morozov and Admiral Kozhyn"] 
  [Text] Former Defense Minister Colonel General Kostyantyn 
Morozov and former commander of Naval Forces Vice Admiral Borys 
Kozhyn are well known in Sevastopol, as they were the ones who 
started the building of the Ukrainian Fleet. At present, both 
K. Morozov and B. Kozyn are candidates for deputies of Ukraine's 
Supreme Council. A few days ago, the Coordination Council of 
the Congress of Sevastopol Ukrainians appealed to residents of 
Kiev and Rozhnyativ who had nominated these military figures, 
and called upon them to give support to K. Morozov and B. Kozhyn 
at the elections. In particular, the Sevastopol Ukrainians' 
appeal reads that it is precisely Kostyantyn Morozov who "did 
everything he could not to allow the conclusion of the 
scandalous agreement on leasing out Sevastopol for 99 years or 
selling the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. 
General Morozov has been and continues to be an authoritative 
and well-respected person not only in the Army." That is why 
the Coordination Council of the Congress of Sevastopol 
Ukrainians called upon the voters of Kiev Constituency No. 1 to 
vote for the former defense minister of Ukraine. Sevastopol 
Ukrainians turned with an identical appeal to residents of the 
town of Rozhnyativ in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast where former 
commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces is registered as a candidate 
for Ukraine's people's deputy. The elections will show whether 
the electorate has heeded the appeal by the Coordination Council 
of Sevastopol Ukrainians.

<F P=106> [Olena Hubina report: "I Don't Trust You by 96 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] The Ukrainian population's confidence in all 
branches of power on the eve of parliamentary elections is so 
low that it is even difficult to determine whose victory is to 
be preferred. In February and March 1994, the "Democratic 
Initiatives" center conducted an opinion poll, which involved 
1,799 respondents. It revealed that just 2 percent of the 
respondents have full confidence in the government, 4 percent -- 
in the president, 2 percent -- in the Supreme Council chairman, 
and 2 percent -- in the leadership of local power structures. 
The level of confidence in Vyacheslav Chornovil, the opposition 
leader, is not much higher -- just 4 percent of the respondents 
were fully in his favor. Somewhat higher is the prestige of the 
militia (6 percent), and 20 percent of the respondents trust the 
Army. 
  Furthermore, 13.6 percent of the respondents stated their 
unwillingness to participate in the elections; 63 percent said 
that they would not like to vote for the same candidate as in 
the previous elections; and just 13 percent have not changed 
their preferences. The decision to vote for a particular 
candidate may be positively influenced mainly by the fact that 
the candidate is... in favor of a union between Ukraine and 
Russia. This was pointed out by 48 percent of the respondents. 
Negative attitude was expressed by 27 percent and yet another 
25 percent showed indifference. Some of the respondents 
considered the candidates' sex as one of their "virtues": 36 
percent of them are ready to vote for a female deputy. 
Thirty-one percent of the respondents like candidates who are 
in favor of a capitalist economic development, 30 percent -- if 
they have support of entrepreneurs, 25 percent -- if they are 
not members of any party. Nineteen percent of the respondents 
prefer those candidates who assert that authoritarian rule (the 
"iron" order) is the best road toward democracy. Physical 
attractiveness of the candidate encourages just 2 percent of the 
voters. 
  Among the respondents, 54 percent believe that Ukraine will 
most likely maintain its integrity and independence in the 
future, 22 percent do not believe in that, 42 percent assume 
that our country will unite with Russia and Belarus within a 
Slavic Union, 31 percent believe that it will become a 
constituent part of a single CIS state (a renewed union), and 28 
percent find it plausible that Ukraine will become a part of 
Russia. 
  At the same time, just 8 percent of respondents positively 
assessed Russian President Boris Yeltsin. It is of interest 
that even CPSU General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev got a higher 
rating -- 16 percent.

  [Text] Kiev, 22 March -- UNIAR has been informed by highly 
reliable sources that the Ukrainian president has issued edict 
No. 64/94 dated 24 February on "Urgent measures to develop 
atomic power engineering and creating a nuclear fuel cycle in 
Ukraine." 
  The document establishes that the State Committee of Ukraine 
for the Use of Nuclear Energy (DerzhKomAtom) is the main 
organization that implements administrative leadership over 
nuclear power stations and other sector enterprises and also 
creates a nuclear fuel cycle in Ukraine, from the mining of 
uranium ore to the processing of radioactive waste. 
  The edict instructs the Cabinet of Ministers: - together 
with 
Ukraine's Academy of Sciences and the Nikolayev Oblast state 
administration to resolve by 1 June 1992 the problem of the 
feasibility of constructing a fourth bloc at the South Ukrainian 
nuclear power station; - to ensure that tariffs for electricity 
are determined early in order to formulate funds and resources 
to ensure the safe exploitation of nuclear power station, to 
create production processes for the reprocessing of nuclear 
waste and to ensure a scientific study of the problems of 
nuclear power engineering; - to review proposals of the 
DerzhKomAtom and the Ministry of Chernobyl with regard to the 
problems of radioactive waste; - to create a medical and 
sanitary directorate within the composition of the DerzhKomAtom; 
to review DerzhKomAtom's proposals for exporting electric power. 
  The State Committee of Ukraine for the Use of Atomic Energy 
is instructed: - to prepare proposals for the program of 
increasing safety of reactor plants; - to envisage the 
commissioning of generating sets with a high degree of 
preparedness: 
  - the sixth bloc of the Zaporozhye nuclear power station in 
1994. 
  - the second bloc of the Chernobyl nuclear power station 
in 1995 
  - the second bloc of Khmelnitskiy nuclear power station in 
1995. 
  - the fourth bloc of the Rovno nuclear power station in 
1996. 
  - the third bloc of the Khmelnitskiy nuclear power station 
in 1998. 
  To create, together with Ukraine's Academy of Sciences, a 
scientific and technical center which would concentrate its 
efforts at the main problem of the sector.

<F P=106> [Petr Zhuravlev report under the "Hearings" rubric: "Border </F>
Guards Have Not Left the Kurils Yet. Russia Intends To Guard 
'All That Coincides With ex-USSR Borders'"] 
  [Text] The Russian Armed Forces General Staff has received 
no presidential directive to prepare a plan for the withdrawal 
of border troops from four islands in the Kuril chain. This was 
announced by Lieutenant General Leontiy Shevtsov, deputy chief 
of the General Staff operations directorate, in parliamentary 
hearings on the problems of the Russian Federation state border 
yesterday. Answering a question from Duma security committee 
head Viktor Ilyukhin on such a directive, Gen. Shevtsov said 
that had it existed it is the General Staff operations 
directorate that "would be responsible for preparations for and 
the very pullout of troops, but there has not been even any talk 
on this topic." The directorate deputy head is also sure that 
had there been a directive, the General Staff's and Defense 
Ministry's reaction to it would have undoubtedly been negative. 
"I doubt the president could have issued such a directive 
without having agreed on it with the General Staff; it is too 
presumptuous to do such a thing without having consulted 
specialists," Mr. Shevtsov underscored. 
  Major General Aleksey Shcherbakov, deputy border troops 
commander, who presented a report at the hearings, stated: 
"Everything coinciding with the borders of the former USSR 
should be guarded." In his words, "It is important to produce a 
series of measures to implement the law on the state border 
passed last April and, in particular, to step up work on giving 
the border validity under international law, on delimitation of 
waters with contiguous countries -- primarily with Japan, the 
United States, and the newly formed states." The border with 
Mongolia should be strengthened, as well as in the "Arctic 
region." Mr. Shcherbakov is convinced that the border with the 
Baltic countries "should be equipped like the one with the 'far 
abroad.'" Besides, he stated, it is necessary to resolve the 
existing territorial problems with Norway, the Baltic countries, 
Mongolia, China, and Japan, and to preclude possible problems 
with Finland, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. 
  Speaking about a concept of organizational development of 
the 
border troops in 1994, Gen. Shcherbakov intimated that, in the 
view of their commanders, the principle of forming the units 
sent, for example, to Tajikistan or Georgia, from volunteers 
should be dropped. "The border is the face of the state," he 
stated, adding that the volunteer service had entailed a decline 
in the general level of literacy, training, and health of the 
soldiers. Alongside this, Mr. Shcherbakov said, there is a 
discussion that it may be wise to alter the call-up age to 19 or 
even 21 years. 
  The resolution summing up yesterday's parliamentary hearings 
notes that "in the wake of the USSR's disintegration... an 
effectively functioning system of measures protecting the 
Russian Federation state border only exists where it coincides 
with the border of the former USSR." It is recognized as 
necessary to prepare by June a draft of amendments to the law on 
the state border so as to bring it in line with the new 
Constitution. The Foreign Ministry was asked, in the interests 
of implementing the law, to resolve, as soon as possible, the 
questions of giving validity under international law to the 
"borders with CIS-member states, as well as the question of 
border rules depending on Russia's individual relations with 
each of these states."

  [Text] On Wednesday the Russian State Duma approved a law 
on federal budget spending in the second quarter of 1994. 
Voting results: 228 - for, 21 against and 19 abstained. 
  The government is to proceed from approved budget plans for 
1994 in financing federal budget spending. The Central Bank 
should offer a 10.6 trillion ruble credit to the government to 
cover the budget deficit. The credit is for 10 years with 
repayment in equal installments beginning with 1998 at 10 
interest. 
  The following limits on current spending on federal 
government bodies were set to restrict expenditures: the office 
of the president - 82,000 Mn, the Council of the Federation - 
11,303 Mn, the State Duma - 27,754 Mn, the government - 15,180 
Mn. By the 30th of May, June and July the government is to 
submit a monthly report on federal budget spending in the 
previous month . 
  According to speaker Ivan Rybkin, the law approved by the 
Duma is going to be submitted to the upper house of parliament 
on Wednesday. He hoped that the Council of the Federation would 
hold a session on Thursday and pass the law so that "the 
president would have it on his table on Monday".

  [Text] Moscow March 22 TASS -- The decision of Kalmyk 
President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov to abolish the republican 
constitution and conclude a "common treaty with the Russian 
Federation" may contradict the Russian constitution, according 
to the spokesman of the Russian president. 
  "It can be understood from the proposal of Ilyumzhinov that 
the talk is about a change in the status of the Republic of 
Kalmykia", the spokesman said in a statement on Monday, 
explaining that such a change was possible under the 
constitution only upon mutual consent of the subject of the 
federation and the federation itself. 
  "If (Ilyumzhinov) proposes to preserve the republican 
status, 
then, according to the Russian Constitution, Kalmykia should 
have its own constitution", the spokesman said. 
  "The Kalmyk president's aspiration to preserve Russia's 
territorial integrity may be only applauded. However, any 
political action, however noble its motivation could be, should 
be brought in line with the principles and norms of the Russian 
Constitution. Any other approach is fraught with substitution 
of the idea of expediency for the idea of law. Such an approach 
will have nothing in common with the challenge of building a 
law-governed state", the spokesman emphasised.

Choice Will Be Almost Random"] 
  [Text] The City Assembly will be adopting the City Charter 
and regional laws that will be mandatory. Therefore, the City 
Assembly will have a very important role in our life, Sergey 
Tsiplyayev emphasized in yesterday's conversation with 
journalists in St. Petersburg. 
  The president's representative is concerned about the 
outcome 
of the election campaign mainly because it was not properly 
covered in the mass media. There is no question, remarked 
Tsiplyayev, that if each of the more than 700 candidates were 
given 20 minutes of air time, we could only pity our voters. 
Television debates between blocs and coalitions, however, would 
have helped voters make a choice. 
  As it stands, said Sergey Tsiplyayev, name recognition is 
about the only factor that can affect the choice; if there is no 
recognized name on the candidate list, the choice will be almost 
random. This was exacerbated, on top of everything else, by 
shortcomings in the preliminary screening mechanism, which 
allowed 10-15 candidates per one seat to remain on the ballot. 
  Political capital is not earned overnight on the eve of 
elections; in order to avoid the current difficulties next time, 
a city political elite should form. A considerable role in this 
may belong to the mass media, noted Tsiplyayev.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Elections: Were They Held or </F>
Not?"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg residents have never before shown 
such striking passivity as they did regarding the elections to 
the City Assembly held last Sunday. In this respect our 
"politicized" compatriots surpassed even the traditionally 
politically inert regions of the Russian hinterland. Barely 
one-fifth of the registered voters of St. Petersburg went to the 
precincts to vote the day before yesterday. 
  Yet, according to the statute on elections to the City 
Assembly of St. Petersburg, they can be considered to have taken 
place only if 25 percent of the potential voters (plus one 
person) have participated in them. 
  Sunday evening, when it became clear that the necessary 
quorum of voters would not appear, the city's mayor, A.S. 
Sobchak, issued an urgent directive "On Changing the Procedure 
for Voting in Elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly." 
  "Taking into account the appeal of the Central Electoral 
Commission, the sociopolitical blocs, the parties, and 
associations," it says in this document, "the time period for 
voting in elections to the St. Petersburg City Assembly shall be 
extended, the operation of the electoral commissions being 
resumed on 21 March 1994 from 0800 through 2200." 
  According to this same directive, the right to participate 
in 
the voting has been granted to citizens who went to school or 
served on active military duty in St. Petersburg. 
  Thus the city voted yesterday for the second day in a row 
and 
today we will find out whether, as a result of this 
unprecedented measure, it succeeded in passing the 25 percent 
mark for voter turnout. 
  Incidentally, even if this happens, most likely the subject 
of whether or not the elections to the City Assembly of St. 
Petersburg really took place will be discussed for a long time 
to come at the most diverse echelons, including the Central 
Electoral Commission and the courts. Because no matter what you 
say, a change in the voting procedure during the course of the 
voting itself is, we repeat, something unprecedented. And, 
naturally, even yesterday this and also other details of the 
election were at the center of the attention of the public and 
the voter associations of the city.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Levashev: "March Bankruptcy"] </F>
  [Text] Regardless of what the final percentage of the 
citizens who turned out for the elections may have been, one 
thing is now clear: The elections failed. The St. Petersburg 
voter expressed his attitude toward the unprecedented farce and 
direct insult to elementary moral sensibilities which bore the 
name "Elections-94." 
  Not one of the possible deputies to the City Assembly could 
work normally. The ballot boxes, which in many precincts were 
left for the night unsealed and without protection, raise doubts 
about the legitimacy of any of them and make inevitable the 
litigation they will be involved in with their rivals who were 
undeservedly defeated. 
  The only way official authority, which is bankrupt in the 
eyes of the people themselves, can be saved would be to 
immediately cancel all the results of the voting on 20 March as 
not expressing the position of the voters. That is if you 
consider it in terms of jurisprudence. And as for real life... 
  Let this endless reading on the radio of endless lists of 
names of candidates remain only as a nightmare in our memories. 
  Let us have nothing but a memory of the 15 (!) electoral 
blocs made up of such mutually exclusive individuals that you 
automatically grab your head and ask outloud: "When were we 
deceived? Throughout the four years before these elections or 
just during the past two months of the election campaign?" 
  How can a bloc which bears the proud name of "Democratic 
Unity of St. Petersburg" and claims to represent democracy "on 
behalf of and on instructions from" all St. Petersburg, appeal 
to the mayor and request, beg from him, two or three more hours 
of voting, another 2-3 percent of the vote? 
  Has our voter really been denied his rights once again and 
been unable to see anyone but people who think about only one 
thing--about power--and aspire to only one thing--to power? How 
was it possible to conduct such an election campaign--without 
once appearing before the voter, without communicating with him 
even once? Which psychologists and other specialists in waging 
election campaigns advised the candidates to do this? 
  It is up to us to make sure that such a thing never happens 
again. We must make sure that the billions of rubles and 
hundreds of thousands of dollars thrown at this phantasmagoric 
spectacle will find a better use. For now we must live with the 
powers we have. "Do not count your chickens before they 
hatch"--even we will not manage to put the cart before the horse. 
  And another useful thing to remember. All discussion to the 
effect that some local authority we have elected in St. 
Petersburg will independently solve all of our problems is a 
fiction. As long as the present topsy-turvyness continues in 
Russia, local authorities will be needed for only one thing--to 
come another step or half step closer to the big Moscow trough 
that feeds all the cities, villages, and field camps of the 
boundless Rus with the ruble as it loses its value. 
  Perhaps our voter has understood this as well.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Kondratenko] </F>
  [Text] St. Petersburg, 24 Mar -- The elections to the St. 
Petersburg city assembly, which took place on 20 and 21 March, 
are not legally valid, the city's Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak 
announced late on Wednesday evening, live on St. Petersburg 
television and radio. 
  Analysis of their results is a task for the future, but one 
thing is clear now -- we got something we did not expect, he 
said. There was a definite negative attitude among voters to 
the elections, in Sobchak's opinion. As a result, the elections 
were recognized in only 25 out of 50 constituencies and even in 
these no candidate got the required 50 percent of votes. 
Therefore, in accordance with the law, there will be a second 
round of voting in these constituencies on 3 April in which the 
candidates who got the most votes will take part, the mayor 
said. Elections will be held in the other constituencies in the 
fall, when structures of public self government will be set up. 
  For the transition period it is planned to set up a public 
council of elected deputies and of representatives of political 
parties and blocs under the mayor's office, Sobchak said. This 
is necessary to ensure that, while there is still no assembly, 
the public may take part in examining all important issues in 
the city. 
  This is a forced measure, Sobchak noted, but, as the saying 
goes, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good. This will 
allow time to test the deputies to see what they are capable of 
and then, perhaps in the fall, the citizens will make the right 
choice. 
  Sobchak said it was a very dangerous situation when people 
were being disappointed by democratic forms of state affairs. 
The very fact of the elections that had taken place, he pointed 
out, forces one to think seriously about the reasons for the 
passivity of St. Petersburg's citizens. This is an abnormal 
situation, the mayor said, and it confirms how deeply resented 
the previous members of the city council were, whose deputies 
were competing with one another to see who would cancel the most 
decisions by the mayor, and effectively failed to tackle the 
city's problems. In Sobchak's opinion, the reasons are also 
that the present candidates did not have their own 
individuality, they were unable to convince the electors, and 
the latter naturally refused to give them their confidence. 
  The mayor believes the negative result is also a reflection 
of the elections to the State Duma, but in the present situation 
the city cannot be left without its own legislative assembly. 
Therefore, Sobchak again appealed to the citizens to assume 
responsibility and carry out their civic duty in the second 
round of voting.

<F P=106> [Report by Tatyana Roshchina: "Saturday Rally: Not the First </F>
and Probably Not the Last"] 
  [Text] Saturday's rally in defense of human rights at 
Vladivostok's central square attracted several thousand people. 
It went under the banners "Down With OMON [Special Missions 
Militia Detachment] Terror," "Shame on Provocateurs," and 
"Defend the People's Mayor." 
  The main theme in the speeches of the former city 
administrator V. Gilgenberg and a number of other former city 
administration functionaries, as well as figures from the Voters 
Association and city residents sympathetic to them, was that V. 
Cherepkov became the victim of a crude provocation organized and 
sanctioned by kray authorities and local court and low 
enforcement bodies. As usual, however, not a shred of proof was 
presented. Those who decidedly did not share this viewpoint--and 
there were more than enough of them-- were not given the floor, 
naturally. 
  Former Mayor V. Cherepkov's address to the citizens was 
greeted with applause. 
  In conclusion, rally participants adopted an appeal to the 
Russian Federation bodies of state power (the State Duma, the 
Federation Council, the General Procuracy, and others), also 
addressed to all Russian Federation citizens. 
  In addition, the Voters Association issued a statement that 
in the event elections are not held on the original date of 27 
March, it will hold another rally in Vladivostok at 1400 next 
Saturday. 
  From the Editors: Monday morning the kray electoral 
commission consultant G. Popov confirmed that, judging from the 
speech yesterday by kray head Nazdratenko on local radio and 
television (Channel 3), elections to the Kray Duma and local 
self-rule bodies have indeed been moved, to 23 October of this 
year.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Petrova and N. Manzhurin: "And No Loose Ends"] </F>
  [Text] Our correspondent asked Senior Counselor of Justice 
V.N. Chichayev, a senior assistant to the Maritime Kray 
procurator, for comments on everything that took place in the 
mayoralty: 
  "On 15 March a decision was made to initiate criminal 
proceedings against City of Vladivostok Mayor V.I. Cherepkov. 
And since he is a candidate for a deputy to the kray duma, in 
keeping with the Temporary Statute on the Elections to the 
Maritime Kray Duma, he cannot be the subject of criminal 
proceedings or subjected to administrative punitive measures 
imposed by the court, without a concurrence of the kray 
procurator. A measure to secure the appearance of the accused 
and other criminal process measures may be applied to a 
candidate only by the ruling of the kray court; therefore, the 
kray procurator did grant his consent. There is also a kray 
court ruling." 
  This is the process basis. The requirements of the law 
formally have been observed in this case. 
  "But was it necessary to do it all so crudely, with the help 
of the OMON [Special Designation Militia Detachments]?" 
  "Having received the procuracy investigator's decision, the 
kray administration had all the grounds to carry it out. In what 
form to conduct this action is no longer the issue of a legal 
process, but a purely administrative one. If the law has been 
violated in the process of carrying out this decision, then the 
procuracy will look into it. Meanwhile, one side is standing 
there with posters, while the other guards the mayoralty; we do 
not have any problems with either. Problems will come up when 
unlawful actions are committed on one or the other side. So far 
we have not received such information. 
  "This is all I can say regarding the events around the 
mayoralty." 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  To the question whether it would be possible to review the 
kray procurator's decision--which, by the way, had been read 
over kray radio--Veniamin Chichayev replied that he does not 
have this document in his possession and does not even know its 
registration number. 
  Just as fruitless was the search for a copy of the decision 
by A.I. Vysotskiy, a deputy procurator and an investigator of 
the Frunzenskiy Rayon Procuracy. Like kray procurator V.V. 
Vasilenko, he also took sick and was not in the office. As to 
Aleksandr Ivanovich's colleagues, they said that they do not 
have any documents relevant to this case. 
  No documents in which we were interested were at the kray 
administration's press service. Neither were we able to meet 
with deputy head of the kray administration I.P. Lebedinets, who 
had signed the decree on I.V. Cherepkov's dismissal and directed 
the operation on the seizure of the "Gray House." We were told 
that he probably had gone on a trip to Ussuriysk. 
  An interesting kind of glasnost. For the chosen only. 
<H6>  * * * * </H6>
  We telephoned the kray court chairman, N.S. Vinogradova, and 
asked her to comment on the events that had taken place on the 
night from 16 to 17 March in Vladivostok. 
  "No comment; all questions should be directed to the kray 
procuracy," said Nina Sergeyevna. And confirmed at the same time 
that the court is aware of the happenings and has given its 
permission for such measures, based on some local-level 
documents.... 
  Nina Sergeyevna refused to show the newspaper any official 
court document on the subject.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Grachev: "`People </F>
Sighed With Relief,' Maintains New Vladivostok Administration 
Head Konstantin Tolstoshein"] 
  [Text] He reported that during the first planning meeting 
he told mayoralty staff: "Those who do not agree to work with us 
may quit." "So far, not too many people have expressed such a 
desire," remarked Tolstoshein. He and his aides began at their 
desks early Saturday morning. 
  "We are restoring contacts with the kray administration, the 
rift with which has brought nothing but harm to the city," the 
head of the new administration told us about his first actions. 
"First and foremost, we intend to take care of low-income city 
residents, open stores for war veterans and disabled Afghan war 
veterans, and take care of the elderly and children." 
  "For over nine months the former head of the administration, 
Viktor Cherepkov, and his team seriously ran down the city 
facilities, including the building from which they managed the 
city," remarked Konstantin Tolstoshein. "Not to mention the 
documentation, which the procuracy will sort out--that is how 
much everything is messed up there. There were no books kept on 
revenue and expenditures; no proper record keeping. As a result, 
finances were expended irrationally." 
  Tolstoshein contends the newspaper BOLSHOY VLADIVOSTOK 
"expressed Cherepkov's interests and received at his personal 
directive several hundred million rubles. And this at a time of 
catastrophic shortage of money for social needs, and the city's 
municipal services are run down. Looking at their wasteful 
masters, lower-rank officials also did not treat taxpayers' 
money with respect." 
  "When I was asked to assume the job of head of city 
administration, I thought hard about it," Konstantin Tolstoshein 
said. "I knew it would be difficult: City residents have been 
deceived by Cherepkov's populist slogans and his promises. I am 
a native Maritime Kray resident. I began as a construction site 
foreman, became head of rayon administration, and then headed 
the kray administration's defense industry committee. I am used 
to tackling difficult tasks."

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Viktor Zelenkin, by </F>
VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Marina Loboda; place and date not 
given: "State Duma Commissions Began To Frequent Vladivostok"] 
  [Text] Another (the third by now) State Duma commission 
investigating the political situation in Maritime Kray's central 
city arrived in Vladivostok on Sunday. Viktor Zelenkin, a State 
Duma deputy and member of the Russia's Choice faction, explained 
the commission's tasks to VLADIVOSTOK correspondent. 
  [Zelenkin] Events in Vladivostok have attracted quite 
serious 
attention in the Duma. Information we received in the form of 
communications from citizens, public organizations, and the city 
mayoralty, warrant concern. It was impossible to come to any 
conclusions on the basis of press reports--they are too 
contradictory. So the only solution was to form a commission and 
sort things out right here; the commission includes four persons 
representing the Russia's Choice and Communists of Russia 
factions, as well as Travkin's and Zhirinovskiy's factions. 
  [Loboda] How do you plan to proceed? 
  [Zelenkin] I want to emphasize from the outset that we are 
not interested in the charges brought against a number of 
mayoralty officials by competent organs--the investigation will 
sort it out. We are interested first and foremost in the 
political and moral underpinning of the events. According to 
information in our possession, the kray administration's actions 
appear improper to us. But this has been in the works for some 
time: I was in Vladivostok as a member of the previous 
commission, and during a personal conversation the vice 
governor, Mr. Lebedinets, admitted that they were already 
preparing documents to remove your mayor--the obstacle was the 
kray procuracy. 
  [Loboda] Have you formed some opinion on the conflict of 
authorities in Vladivostok on the basis of results of previous 
commission's inquiry? 
  [Zelenkin] I think that the current confrontation between 
the 
kray and city authorities is just the very tip of the iceberg. 
The roots are much deeper, and most likely these roots are of a 
criminal nature. But this is only a guess; the important part 
right now is to study the situation. We plan a number of 
meetings with representatives of local authorities, law 
enforcement organs, and Vladivostok residents. 
  [Loboda] What will your commission produce? 
  [Zelenkin] A detailed report that will be submitted to the 
State Duma and the president. 
  [Loboda] I have to confess that today we were expecting not 
so much the arrival of the Duma commission as that of Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy, as promised by the mass media. 
  [Zelenkin] We guessed it as soon as we arrived at the 
airport: The group of journalists waiting by the aircraft ladder 
were clearly disappointed. It is quite alarming that some city 
residents pin their hopes on Zhirinovskiy to solve their 
problems: Just wait, he will come and settle everything. Believe 
me, he will not. He will only make political points for himself 
in your complex political situation. He will simply use you, as 
he always does. 
  [Loboda] How long are you planning to stay in Vladivostok? 
  [Zelenkin] As long as needed. We will certainly hold a press 
conference for the mass media on the results.

"Elections Moved to the Fall. At Workers' Request, Naturally"] 
  [Text] At the briefing for journalists Sunday morning, 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, the head of the kray administration, and 
the Vladimir Ignatenko, the president's Maritime Kray 
representative, announced that the date for elections to the 
Maritime Kray Duma and local self-rule bodies has been changed. 
  Yevgeniy Nazdratenko said that on 19 March he signed Decree 
No. 116, which moves the date of elections from 27 March 1994 to 
23 October 1994. Point 3 of this decree instructs the kray 
administration's financial services to redirect the money 
appropriated in the kray budget for conducting elections to 
Maritime Kray cities and rayons to be used for social protection 
of low- income citizens. 
  Nazdratenko said the cost of these elections to the Maritime 
Kray budget amounts to R3 billion. The Central Electoral 
Commission allocated only R600 million. "We absolutely cannot 
take R2.4 billion out of the local budget on the threshold of 
spring sowing," said Nazdratenko and, in reply to journalists' 
questions, added: "If there is no money for elections in the 
fall, we will have to move them again." 
  In addition, Nazdratenko reminded the gathering that a 
succession of court actions by a number of Maritime Kray 
political parties against the kray administration had been 
caused precisely because the parties considered it necessary to 
move up the elections. The kray court rejected the claims, but 
the parties which did not agree with the outcome appealed to the 
Supreme Court. "Therefore," said Nazdratenko, "we accommodated 
the wish of these people." 
  It was especially emphasized at the briefing that Decree No. 
116 had the concurrence of the Central Electoral Commission. 
  At the same time, in the opinion of Ye. Nazdratenko and V. 
Ignatenko, the rights of already-nominated candidates for 
deputies are not violated in any way. In the fall they will have 
the same legal status as now, but in addition will be able to 
familiarize the voters much better with their views and 
programs. "This time will allow us to avoid the element of 
chance that was present in the short State Duma election 
campaign," said Nazdratenko. 
  In short, the election campaign continues. 
  As was announced at the briefing, Maritime Kray is not alone 
in its decision to move up the elections--17 Russian oblasts 
already have done so. 
  Presidential representative Vladimir Ignatenko said that 
postponement of elections was to a considerable extent also 
prompted by forecasts of lower political activity of the 
population, which already had manifested itself during the 12 
December elections. 
  Ignatenko particularly emphasized that the decision to move 
the elections is not linked in any way to official charges the 
kray procuracy had brought against some officials in the 
Vladivostok administration and their suspension from their job 
for the time of inquiry. Moreover, in Ignatenko's opinion, those 
who are registered as candidates for deputy seats now get an 
excellent opportunity to explain in detail their political views 
and programs.

<F P=106> [From the "Pacific Ocean" Program] </F>
  [Text] Vladimir Kravtsov, State Duma deputy and deputy 
general procurator of the Russian Federation, announced last 
Friday that criminal proceedings against Viktor Cherepkov, mayor 
of Vladivostok, have been temporarily suspended. He emphasized 
that the matter has been suspended only until Konstantin Mavrin, 
general procuracy investigator for particularly important 
matters, arrives in Vladivostok. 
  Kravtsov's Duma statement resulted in the chamber's decision 
to hear the General Procuracy of the Russian Federation's 
representative on the Vladivostok events, regarding the 
instigation of criminal proceedings against the city's mayor on 
bribery charges. Kravtsov also said the matter against Cherepkov 
was instigated on 10 February this year. The size of the bribe 
was quoted to be 3 million rubles. A portion of the money, 
which incidentally was marked by the bribe-giver, was found in 
the mayor's office. According to the deputy general procurator, 
the bribe-giver is someone without fixed abode or employment. 
According to Kravtsov, the hand over of the bribe, notification 
by the bribe-giver that the money had been handed over, and 
instigation of proceedings against Cherepkov, all occurred on 10 
February.

<F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kholenko: "Spring Cleanup for City </F>
Trash"] 
  [Text] The theme of spring trash cleanup in Vladivostok 
continued Thursday, following the cleanup from the city 
administration of its previous leaders. A conference was held 
in the mayor's office on the emergency situation in the city 
with respect to medical-sanitary conditions. 
  "By 9 May the city of Vladivostok must be 'licked 
clean'"--stated new head of administration, Konstantin 
Tolstoshein, at the outset of the conference. Everyone present 
agreed with him. 
  Attending the conference were the heads of reinstituted 
rayon 
administrations, militia representatives, medical-sanitation 
inspection personnel, and housing department officials. They 
reported on the situation and proposed measures for bringing 
sanitation order to the city. 
  The following measures are contemplated. As soon as the 
weather brings positive temperatures, work will begin on the 
repair and asphalting of city roads in disrepair. Commercial 
stalls and sidewalk vendors--the main "suppliers" of trash in 
densely populated areas--will be administratively punished for 
refusal to clean up their vicinity, up to and including removal 
of business licenses and cancellation of contracts for lease of 
the land their stalls occupy. It will also be proposed that 
enterprises of all forms of ownership conduct trash cleanup of 
their surrounding areas. 
  A problem arises regarding the cleanup of housing unit 
areas, 
insofar as residential building maintenance services simply lack 
the resources to accomplish this. Konstantin Tolstoshein 
proposed reinstitution of the fine old tradition of subbotniki 
[days of voluntary unpaid labor], so that tenants--to put it 
bluntly-- collect the trash around their homes for the city 
services to haul away to the dumps. 
  As far as the financing of road repair and city cleanup is 
concerned, according to Tolstoshein, Maritime Kray Governor 
Yevgeniy Nazdratenko has promised to assist Vladivostok in this 
effort. 
  Konstantin Tolstoshein expressed certain considerations of 
principle at the conference with respect to the future structure 
of the city's government. "It is not we who must work for the 
structure. The structure must work to benefit the people of 
Vladivostok," he stated. Tolstoshein is an "advocate of a city 
with functionally capable rayons, rayons with a high level of 
independence." In this regard, there will be a restoration in 
the rayon administrations of departments for enterprise 
registration, departments for registration and distribution of 
housing, and other subdivisions. A definitively new structure 
of city government will apparently be approved by the end of 
next week. 
  In this regard, the new administration is compelled to 
engage 
in another kind of cleanup. Efforts are presently underway in 
the mayor's office to repeal certain decrees of the previous 
administration not conducive to the effective operation of city 
structures. Numerous legal proceedings initiated against 
various authorities on behalf of the mayor's office are being 
revoked. 
  At the same time, the new head of city administration, 
Konstantin Tolstoshein, has refused to repeal free travel on 
public transportation in Vladivostok.

"Japanese Lobby in the Maritime Territory Administration? High 
Policy Around Radioactive Contamination"] 
  [Text] Vladivostok--The political leaders of Tokyo, 
Moscow, Vladivostok, and even Stockholm are unanimous: Only 
Japanese decontamination plants can save the Sea of Japan from 
radioactive wastes... 
  As VLADIVOSTOK correspondents have learned from unofficial 
but completely reliable sources, the meeting that took place 
last week between Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Kozyrev 
and American Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in addition 
to the resolution of high policy, also had a specific result for 
the Maritime Territory, which, it appears, could have not 
entirely favorable consequences for the territory. 
Specifically: A transfer of documentation on a project for 
utilization of liquid radioactive wastes in the Maritime 
Territory proposed by the Marubeni Corporation took place in a 
lobby of the summit with a view to its coordination in our 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of allocating $40 
million to this corporation... 
  In the meantime, as VLADIVOSTOK has already reported, 
scientists of the Far Eastern Department of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences came to the conclusion that the Japanese technology 
is obsolete, energy-intensive, and expensive to operate 
(VLADIVOSTOK, 16 March). But the technology created in the 
Maritime Territory was not even considered in the territorial 
administration, and it can be assumed that nothing is known 
about it in the Russian Government. 
  At the same time, the problem of utilizing liquid 
radioactive 
wastes in the Maritime Territory is one of the most important 
categories on the agenda of the official visit to Moscow of 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan Tsutomu Hata. Hata's visit 
to Russia starts Saturday. 
  A week earlier, Prime Minister of Japan Morikiro Hosokawa 
talked about this in a conversation with Kirsti Krondall, 
chairperson of the parliament of Norway, who was visiting Tokyo. 
Krondall told the Japanese prime minister that the problem with 
disposal by the Russian Navy is common for both Japan and 
Norway, and her country intends to find an opportunity to render 
Russia technical and financial support for the construction of 
enterprises in the area of Murmansk for processing liquid 
radioactive wastes (ZhRO). 
  The same--and only--variant of a resolution of the problem 
of 
utilization of liquid radioactive wastes in the Maritime 
Territory will also be discussed by the minister of foreign 
affairs of Japan during his visit to Moscow. 
  The day before yesterday, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, head of 
administration of the Maritime Territory, reported in an 
interview on the television program "Vostok-TV" that the 
Japanese Government had decided to deliver equipment and finance 
the construction of two installations for processing liquid 
radioactive wastes in Bolshoy Kamen and at a facility of the 
Pacific Ocean Fleet. According to Nazdratenko, the total value 
of the resources being allocated by Japan under this project 
amounts to $12 million. 
  Nazdratenko said that Japanese representatives (he did not 
know exactly who) are disturbed by the problem of effective and 
speedy implementation of construction and also want guarantees 
that not one dollar of the proposed sum will be expended for 
purposes that are not directly connected with the project. The 
governor of the Maritime Territory sees such guarantees in the 
mechanism of the resources being transferred directly from Tokyo 
to Vladivostok. Nazdratenko said in the television interview 
that a document concerning such a mechanism was actually turned 
over to Kozyrev. However, any investment operation presumes the 
presence of some kind of accounts (what is the money to be paid 
for?), and it is perfectly clear that the Japanese project 
specifically will be discussed during Hata's negotiations with 
representatives of the Russian Government. 
  This, in general, is logical: If the Japanese Government 
intends to build a plant (it is unimportant whether in Japan, 
the United States, or Bolshoy Kamen), then it is Japanese and 
not American or Bolshoy Kamen companies that should get the 
profit and the work positions... 
  However, the total disregard of the territorial 
administration's incomparably more effective technology for 
decontaminating radioactive waste proposed by Vladivostok 
scientists was also confirmed by the fact that literally two 
days before the Kozyrev-Christopher meeting, Governor of the 
territory Ye. Nazdratenko promised to receive V. Sergiyenko, 
chairman of the Far Eastern Department of Russian Academy of 
Sciences, regarding this question, but the meeting did not 
occur. As his reception room invariably reported: "The 
governor is very busy with preparations for the "summit 
meeting"... The result of this "preparation" is now clear: 
Nazdratenko personally handed over to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs the documentation of Marubeni lobbying. As a result of 
this, there can no longer be any doubt regarding persistent 
pushing to the detriment of our interests by officials of the 
territorial organization of what they know to be an obsolete and 
extremely expensive Japanese project. 
  Meanwhile, literally the other day scientists of the Far 
Eastern Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences received a 
new multicomposite sorbent from local materials which in its 
characteristics already surpasses those that are available. 
Laboratory tests for the purpose of decontaminating liquid 
radioactive wastes of the Zvezda plant produced simply brilliant 
results. This sorbent "cleaned" these wastes to such an extent 
that as a result not even highly sensitive special apparatus 
could record the content of such a highly active radioactive 
element as strontium... In order to bring the technology of 
utilization of liquid radioactive wastes from the stage of 
laboratory tests to the creation of an industrial test 
installation using the given sorbent, our scientists are asking 
for a little more than 1 billion rubles all told, which, of 
course, is not comparable to the $40 million for which the 
Japanese corporation is selling its 30-year-old technology. 
  One way or another, VLADIVOSTOK intends to follow the 
development of events around this scandalous deal, although it 
is possible that we still will not be able to give the numbers 
of bank accounts in Japan regarding the transfer of unspecified 
hard currency sums on behalf of some of our officials and 
persons from middleman firms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "In Four Years, Rents May Exceed </F>
Wages"] 
  [Text] The introduction of a new system of paying for 
housing and public utilities in the kray is under way. The 
procedure for effecting transition to this system is prescribed 
in Decree of the Russian Federation Government No. 935, dated 22 
September 1993. 
  A week ago, kray Governor Yevgeniy Nazdratenko adapted the 
government's decision to Maritime Kray, signing a decree with a 
similar title--"On the Transition to the New System of Payment 
for Housing and Public Utilities and on the Procedure for 
Affording Citizens Compensation (Grants) in Effecting Payment 
for Housing and Public Utilities." 
  In accordance with these documents, by 1998 an apartment 
owner will pay 100 percent of the expenses for residential 
upkeep and repair (except capital repair), as well as for public 
utilities. Each year, beginning this year, the proportion of 
money paid by citizens to compensate for these expenses will be 
increased by 20 percent. 
  The social housing norm has been established in the kray at 
20 meters per individual, and maximum norms for public utility 
consumption (for example, 120 kilowatt-hours per family member 
per month) became effective 1 March, within the framework of 
which rents must not exceed 10 percent of a family's aggregate 
income. The state is providing compensation and grants for this 
purpose. Housing grant departments must be established in 
administrations at all levels prior to 1 April. 
  Beginning 1 March, the proprietors of residences of all 
forms 
of ownership, including dormitories, will pay 20 percent of the 
prime cost of housing and public utilities. According to 
Mikhail Savchenko, chairman of the kray administration Committee 
on Housing and Municipal Services, the average three-person 
family in Vladivostok will pay 19,200 rubles [R] per month over 
the course of this year for an average (two-room) apartment. In 
general, citizens' expenses for the use of living quarters will 
increase 17-fold.

Cooperatives"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast -- Several more land 
auctions will be held in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast with the help 
of specialists from an international financial corporation. 
They will be held prior to the start of spring field work. 
Such auctions were previously held at the "Pravdinskaya" 
Association and the "60th Anniversary of October" Kolkhoz, about 
which IZVESTIYA has written. 
  It is envisaged that soft loans will be granted to newly 
formed agricultural enterprises -- partnerships, cooperatives, 
and private farms -- under a directive by Nizhniy Novgorod 
Oblast Governor B. Nemtsov. These loans will be granted on the 
basis of an average of 200,000 rubles per hectare for the land 
acquired by the new owners at auction. These resources are to 
be allocated out of the oblast budget. The loans are granted 
for a three-year term at a very low rate of interest. 
  According to the oblast administration's Department of 
Agriculture and Land Reform, such targeted financial support for 
newly set up agricultural enterprises and private farmers will 
help them to confidently take their first steps and, in 
particular, to carry out the upcoming field work. It is 
interesting that around four dozen applications to hold land 
auctions have already been received by the department from 
former kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which will enable the peasants 
to own land and property in reality rather than just on paper.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Grigorenko: "An Unexpected Finale"] </F>
  [Text] A press conference took place yesterday in Kazan, 
at which five recent candidates for deputy of the State Duma 
took part. The candidates came from two electoral 
districts--Moscow District No. 24 and Volga District No. 27. 
  Yuriy Voronin spoke first at the press conference, telling 
of 
crafty maneuvers that affected the outcome of the election in 
the Moscow district. In the first place, the number of ballots 
arriving at the polling stations did not coincide with the 
number issued to the voters and canceled--there was a difference 
of about 7,000. Secondly, ballots from portable ballot boxes 
were often dumped into the common "kettle" without drawing up 
separate official documentation. Thirdly, hardly any of the 
authorized candidates for deputy were present for the tallying 
of the vote. Fourthly, only following intervention on the part 
of the Central Electoral Committee did the district commission 
permit the former contenders for a deputy seat to familiarize 
themselves with the control documents. 
  Each of the press conference participants added his own 
contribution to the overall picture of the election just held. 
Vladimir Belyayev, for example, reported that according to 
information from observers from the Accord movement, from 40 to 
80 percent of city-precinct voters voted for him, but the 
official statistics show somewhere around one-third. Mars 
Rameyev shared his impressions from meetings with rural 
residents, who were given a "directive" to show preference to 
Oleg Morozov. 
  Volga District No. 27 was no different in this respect, 
judging from the comments of its two candidates. As Aleksandr 
Sapiy related, data from the district commission and 18 precinct 
commissions did not coincide, and a mysterious "juggling" 
occurred at eight precincts, as a result of which 500 votes were 
"pulled away" from the candidacy of the leader of Tatarstan's 
Communist Party. But perhaps most categorical of all was the 
assessment of Munavir Murtazin (who is, incidentally, senior 
assistant to the procurator for military matters), who stated 
that the procuracy must institute criminal proceedings with 
respect to the facts uncovered in accordance with Article 133 of 
the Russian Federation Criminal Code, which envisages serious 
punishment for those who participate in the forgery of election 
documents. 
  The candidates for deputy participating in the press 
conference believe it would be advisable to establish a 
commission that would carefully examine all the "delicate" 
aspects of the present election campaign and subsequently 
publish the results. In addition, the intention to apply to the 
procuracy was also clearly stated.

<F P=106> [Tamara Levina report: "An Agreement That Stabilizes Life"] </F>
  [Text] An agreement among the Cabinet of Ministers of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, the republic Council of Trade Unions, 
and the Association of State-Owned Enterprises of Tatarstan for 
1994 was ceremonially signed in Kazan yesterday. The document 
was sealed by the signatures of Mukhammat Sabirov, prime 
minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, Farida Gaynullina, 
chairman of the republic Council of Trade Unions, and Yuner 
Yemaletdinov, president of the Association of State-Owned 
Enterprises. 
  This is the fourth agreement among the government, the 
unions, and the employers on joint participation and guarantees 
in the solution of labor and socioeconomic questions based on 
current legislation and the implementation of additional 
measures. The previous ones helped create in Tatarstan a 
well-oiled system of targeted social protection, curb the growth 
of unemployment, preserve the system of preschools, and decide a 
number of other questions. 
  The present year does not promise to be easy, and the new 
agreement provides for the creation of conditions for 
stabilization of the economy, social protection for the working 
people and public, jobs for the population and development of 
the labor market, pay and occupational and environmental safety 
guarantees, and development of the social sphere in rural 
localities. The commitments of each of the parties are clearly 
drawn. For example, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of 
Tatarstan will retain state regulation of the maximum levels of 
profitability and fixed prices on products of the monopoly 
sectors and enterprises, energy, and socially significant groups 
of commodities (individual foods, prescription drugs and 
medication, children's items, and so forth) and also on vitally 
important services, the public service of passenger transport, 
individual types of communications services, and public 
utilities, public gas, electric, and heating tariffs, and the 
charge for housing, having entered the corresponding resources 
in the republic budget. The Association of State-Owned 
Enterprises of the Republic of Tatarstan will organize work on 
placing orders at the enterprises for the manufacture of 
machinery, mechanisms, equipment, instruments, and spares for 
the needs of the national economy of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  In addition, from the resources of state social insurance 
the 
parties plan to send to sanatoriums and recreation centers 
43,000 workers (including 2,700 children); to preventive health- 
sanatoriums, 80,000 persons (10,000 children); and to 
health-and-fitness camps, 135,000 children. 
  The agreement took effect the moment it was signed.

  [Text] Madrid March 24 TASS -- The very first day of 
President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev's official visit to 
Spain proved to be fruitful. A number of important bilateral 
documents aimed at developing cooperation between the two 
countries were signed on Wednesday evening. 
  At a solemn ceremony in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariga and Vice-Prime 
Minister Syzdyk Abishev and Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan 
Tuleutay Suleymanov signed a declaration on the principles of 
mutual relations between Kazakhstan and Spain, a treaty on 
mutual encouragement and protection of investments and an 
agreement on cooperation in the spheres of economy and 
production. 
  The declaration emphasised that political, economic and 
social changes taking place within the international relation 
framework should be accompanied by more closer cooperation 
between the two states in the interests of ensuring peace, 
stability, progress and social well-being of their people. The 
document reflects aspirations of the two countries to develop 
international cooperation in the spheres of education, culture, 
protection of the environment and fight against drug trafficking. 
  Addressing a press conference, Solana and Abishev emphasised 
that the signed documents open new prospects for mutual 
cooperation in many spheres. Notwithstanding the interest 
displayed by both sides in the development of trade and economic 
ties, the turnover between Spain and Kazakhstan was worth only 
181.5 thousand U.S. dollars in 1993. This entire sum was spent 
on imports of foodstuffs from Spain. Only two Spanish-Kazakh 
joint ventures out of a total 2,000 registered in the republic 
have been set up. These figures cited by Abishev also had their 
impact on journalists.

  [Text] Republic of Kazakhstan -- In Kazakhstan a republic 
Communist Party has been registered at the fourth attempt. 
  The audience stood to applaud as L. Korolkov, chairman of 
the 
Communist Party Coordinating Council, received the registration 
certificate. Kazakhstan's communists, whose persistence cannot 
be denied, (they fought every day for two-and-a-half years to 
achieve registration) intend to make their presence felt in 
parliament and in public life. Another 13 social and religious 
organizations received their registration documents along with 
the Communist Party. 
  L. Korolkov, the leader of the Communist Party, told 
journalists that he sincerely believes in the building of 
communism. However, the methods of achieving this goal are 
somewhat different from those of 1917. "There will be no 
repetition of the armed uprising, I guarantee you that," he 
declared.

  [Text] Dushanbe March 23 TASS -- "The law on the status of 
Russia's peacemaking forces may be adopted by legislators 
already in April this year," Pavel Grachev, Russian defense 
minister, said today at a meeting with servicemen of the 
Tajikistan-stationed 201st Motorized Infantry Division forming a 
part of the collective peacemaking forces in Tajikistan. 
  The Russian defense minister is currently in this central 
Asian republic in connection with conducting exercises of the 
collective peacemaking forces in the south of Tajikistan. 
  The adoption of the law on the status of the Russian 
peacemaking forces will allow to resolve many problems including 
the one concerning social benefits to servicemen and members of 
their families located outside Russia, Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev stressed. 
  The fate of the Russian troops in Tajikistan whose term of 
stay expires on December 31 this year "will depend on the 
political solution to the problems of this region", the minister 
told ITAR- TASS in an exclusive interview. 
  At the same time, he noted, the "strategic interests of 
Russia and other Commonwealth countries make Russia to station 
its troops in the republic and on the Tajik-Afghan border". 
  Speaking on the exercises being carried out in the south of 
the republic, the defense minister emphasised that this was not 
the "demonstration of force" but a planned event within the 
framework of collective security of the Commonwealth countries. 
  According to Pavel Grachev, one of the aims of his visit is 
to discuss principles and terms of a political settlement of the 
region's problems with the leadership of the republic and the 
command of the peacemaking forces. 
  "Negotiations are the main way to the peaceful settlement of 
the conflict," Pavel Grachev stressed. The variant of handing 
over the peacemaking forces from the Defense Ministry to any 
other department is unacceptable as other departments "have no 
experience of handling troops", the Russian defense minister 
pointed out. 
  On Thursday morning Pavel Grachev is due to visit the area 
of 
the exercises of the peacemaking forces.

  [Text] Saidmorod Fattoyev, an aide to parliament Chairman 
Emomali Rakhmonov, denied the rumors of the government dragging 
its feet on the start of talks with the opposition in Moscow. 
  He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax that a state 
commission had been set up last year under the chairmanship of 
first Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Abdulmajid Dostiyev 
which had initiated contacts and negotiated with all political 
groups on civic accord and return of refugees. This commission, 
jointly with other organizations, in particular the UN, had 
succeeded in having 800,000 refugees, notably displaced persons, 
returning to Tajikistan. By official accounts, he said, there 
are no more than 30,000 Tajik refugees in Afghanistan and the 
commission was doing its best for their return. IF Note: The 
UN High Commissioner's Office on Refugees resumed repatriation 
of Tajik refugees from Afghanistan via Uzbekistan Wednesday. A 
large group of Tajik refugees is expected to arrive in the 
southern town of Termez in the afternoon of March 23 to be moved 
into Tajikistan by bus. Last year 8000 Tajik refugees had 
returned via Termez from the Sakhi camp outside the Afghan town 
of Mazar-e Sharif. 
  Fattoyev thought that the armed opposition wanted the 
refugees to be kept abroad "as hostages or a card in the power 
game." 
  He said that the overriding goals of the talks with the 
opposition was securing the return of the remaining refugees, a 
civic accord, cessation of armed struggle by the opposition and 
easing the tension on the Tajik-Afghan border. 
  "Our willingness to start talks is no sign of our weakness. 
The opposite is true, the government holds the situation in the 
country under control but is prepared to hear its political 
opponents. This is a goodwill gesture." 
  Fattoyev also thought that it would not be proper to say 
that 
the talks were put off because the date of their start had not 
been negotiated. IF Note: A senior official in the Russian 
Foreign Ministry told Interfax that the talks between the Tajik 
government and the armed opposition were to start in Moscow but 
no exact date had been specified. He thought that the date had 
been changed from mid-April to some time later because "much 
time is consumed in sending the invitations and other 
organizational matters." 
  In Fattoyev's view, the talks were not the overriding issue 
because the government had more urgent matters to handle. In 
particular, "we have to stop the production decline at least in 
the agriculture, have the sowing done, move enough foodstuffs, 
diesel fuel and gasoline in and restart the basic economic 
mechanisms." 
  Fattoyev strongly denied rumors that Dushanbe was under 
significant pressure from Tashkent as far as relations with the 
opposition were concerned. "Uzbekistan is our closest neighbor 
which has its interests in Tajikistan but its wishes and advice 
are made known in the way this is done throughout the civilized 
world," Fattoyev emphasized. In his words, Tajikistan is a 
sovereign state "and any pressure or dictation or interference, 
in particular into relations with the opposition, is out of the 
question." 
  He was convinced that talks with the opposition will take 
place. He thought that the government had to talk with those 
opposition leaders who had an influence with the armed groups. 
IF Note: An informed source close to the Tajik government said 
that the government did not want to talk to those who 
represented only themselves. The source told Interfax that "any 
field commander has greater influence in the republic than 
former kazikalon (spiritual authority) Akbar Turajonzoda (now 
staying in Iran) or Atakhon Latifi, chairman of the Coordinating 
Center of Tajikistan's Democratic Forces. "These men act as 
minor mediating figures. We should talk with those who command 
armed opposition," he emphasized. This was, in his view, the 
reason why the talks could not start. 
  Fattoyev felt that it was the opposition leaders who were 
dragging their feet. He believed that "there was no consensus 
in the opposition" whereas the Tajik government knew what it 
could offer. 
  Local observers thought that the talks would hardly bear 
fruit immediately and improve the situation for the sole reason 
that the opposition is divided but the government would meet the 
opposition halfway for the sake of accord.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Dushanbe, 24 Mar -- Official Dushanbe is ready to 
start the process of negotiations with the opposition, 
Abdulmadjid Samadov, the head of the Tajik Government stated to 
journalists today. In his words, intensive preparations for the 
forthcoming dialogue are under way in the republic, and a 
delegation has already been practically formed. It will be 
headed by Shukurjon Zuhurov, the republic's labor minister. 
  The prime minister stressed that there is no alternative to 
a 
peaceful political settlement of the Tajik conflict, but he 
refrained from stating a preliminary date for the beginning of 
the dialogue and the names of the representatives of the 
opposition forces with whom the authorities of Tajikistan are 
ready to sit down at the negotiating table. 
  Incidentally, the latter circumstance is very important. 
Local observers believe that, and Colonel-General Boris 
Pyankov, the commander of the collective peacekeeping forces in 
Tajikistan stated on several occasions that the real force is 
represented by that part of the opposition which, figuratively 
speaking, is controlling weapons. It is this part of the 
opposition, which declared itself as the irreconcilable 
opposition to the present regime in Tajikistan, and which set up 
the so-called government in exile in Afghanistan, that has, of 
late, also announced its readiness for a political dialogue with 
Dushanbe. 
  Local observers, however, are quite skeptical about the 
feasibility of the dialogue, referring, in particular, to the 
recent statement made by the press center of the republican 
procurator general, which demands that practically all the 
leaders of the armed opposition be detained and taken to court, 
including Khodzhiakbar Turadzhonzoda, former spiritual leader of 
the Tajik Muslims; Shodmon Yusuf, chairman of the Democratic 
Party; Davlat Ousman, deputy chairman of the Islamic Rebirth 
Party, and Tohir Abudujabar, chairman of the Rastokhez movement. 
Criminal proceedings against them, the Tajik procurator 
general's statement says, were instituted in absentia as early 
as spring 1993. They are accused of a number of crimes against 
the republic's constitutional system. Davlat Khudonazarov, one 
of the opposition leaders, is on a black list too, although 
criminal proceedings against him have not been officially 
started.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Peacekeeping Forces' Training </F>
Battles"] 
  [Text] Tajikistan -- Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, arrived in Dushanbe. With the defense 
ministers of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan he will observe the 
course of the tactical exercise by the collective peacekeeping 
forces and Russian Border Troops in the Republic of Tajikistan. 
  As we know, the main aim of the exercises is to improve the 
system of management of the collective peacekeeping forces and 
also to rehearse combat teamwork training and collaboration with 
the Russian Border Troops units. The first stage -- putting the 
units in a state of heightened combat readiness, advancing into 
the region of the exercises, and field fortification -- has been 
completed. As Colonel General Grigoriy Bessmertnyy, chief of 
staff of the collective peacekeeping forces, stressed in an 
exclusive interview with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, all troops taking part 
in the exercise have taken up their positions and are prepared 
to research defense operations. It is planned later in 
conjunction with the border guards as the tactical training 
situation proceeds to switch from defensive operations to a 
counterattack -- to "restore the situation along the Republic of 
Tajikistan state border." 
  Grigoriy Bessmertnyy stressed that the exercise which is 
being conducted is not connected with the complication of the 
situation on the Tajik-Afghan border and is a planned one. The 
joint command had given advance notification of the start of the 
exercise and had invited numerous observers, including through 
UN channels, and the ambassadors of Russia and the United States 
to the Republic of Tajikistan. He also denied rumors which had 
appeared in various mass media that the troops' actions could 
cause serious harm to the natural resources of the "Tigrovaya 
balka" state nature reserve. The collective peacekeeping forces 
chief of staff stated that the region of the exercise had been 
agreed in advance with the leadership of the Republic of 
Tajikistan and with environmental specialists. The rumors which 
have appeared are all the more unfounded in that the area where 
the exercise is being conducted is in the Northern regions of 
"Tigrovaya balka" and more than 15 km from the borders of the 
state nature reserve. 
  Touching on the progress of the exercise, Colonel General 
Grigoriy Bessmertnyy noted that it had entered its most active 
stage 23 March. 
  Our correspondent visited the Russian border guards on the 
eve of the study, and in particular the tragically famous 12th 
border post, which now bears the name of 25 heroes. According 
to Lieutenant Aleksandr Orlov, acting chief of the post, the 
situation here remains complex. On 20 March Tajik gunmen and 
mojahedin had yet again shelled the mobile observation point. 
The border guards put an end to the act of provocation with 
return mortar fire. There were no casualties among the border 
guards. Here, at the 12th border post, Russian servicemen of 
the 201st motorized rifle division are serving -- tank crews 
under the command of Senior Lieutenant Yuriy Nekrasov.

"Tajikistan"] 
  [Text] It has transpired that the Tajikistan authorities 
are preparing to try four Tajik journalists who have spent 14 
months in a Dushanbe prison on charges of "calling for the 
overthrow of Soviet power." Mirbobo Mirrakhimov, former 
chairman of the State Committee for Television and Radio and a 
candidate of historical sciences, was arrested on 8 January in 
Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]; Akhmadsho Komilov, former Dushanbe 
television studio director, and television analysts Khurshed 
Nazarov and Khayriddin Kosimov were arrested at the same time in 
the Kyrgyz city of Osh. Eduard Sagalayev, chairman of the 
International Confederation of Journalists Unions, and Aleksey 
Simonov, chairman of the Fund for the Protection of Glasnost, 
have signed an appeal to the CIS heads of state, pointing to the 
dubious criminal charges being pressed against the journalists. 
  A few weeks ago, head of government Abdudzhalil Samadov 
promised that he would see to it that the arbitrary action would 
be stopped, but the promise has gone unfulfilled. The appeal 
calls on the CIS heads of state to help alleviate the 
journalists' predicament and to hold open court hearings as soon 
as possible to be attended by international observers.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- A draft statute on 
transportation of military and dangerous cargos through 
Lithuanian territory will be submitted to the government for 
consideration by April 1. According to an April 22 government 
resolution, the document will be drafted by the Ministries of 
Defense and Transportation, as well as other state institutions 
concerned. 
  The government decided that until the statute comes into 
effect, military and dangerous cargos will be transported in 
accordance with the Lithuanian-Russian documents signed last 
November, namely the agreement on transit of Russian troops 
withdrawing from Germany and the protocol on transit regulations. 
  The government also appointed commissioners who will deal 
with the transportation of military and dangerous cargos through 
Lithuania. Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius was named to be 
the chief commissioner. He will be assisted by the chief 
inspector of the Lithuanian Dangerous Cargo Transportation 
Inspection, Algirdas Jurkevicius.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Gromak: "Lithuanians Promise To Continue </F>
Housing Construction in Kaliningrad"] 
  [Text] A meeting has been held in Vilnius between 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius and Admiral 
Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Yuriy 
Matochkin, chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration. 
  The sides examined a question of extreme important both for 
the Baltic Fleet command and for the Kaliningrad Oblast 
administration: the construction by the Lithuanian "Selma" 
association of housing for the units which are being withdrawn 
from the Baltic states. As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already 
described, after the Lithuanian special services had arrested 
"Selma" President Vladas Laurinavicius, to whom the Russian 
Federation defense minister was to have presented, during a trip 
to Kaliningrad, the Russian Government's directive stipulating 
the terms for extinguishing our debt to the firm, the 
construction has been threatened with disruption. 
  On the day we arrived in Vilnius the Lithuanian newspapers 
published a series of articles about the scandal involving the 
"Selma" president's arrest. RESPUBLIKA, for instance, published 
a photograph of Laurinavicius with the following caption: 
"Search among military and their business partners." LIETUVOS 
RYTAS had "Russian Generals Make Strategic Withdrawals," and so 
forth. 
  "The Lithuanian side's position is unequivocal," Prime 
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius stated repeatedly at the talks. 
"We shall continue the construction." As for the arrest of 
"Selma's" general director, Lithuania's general prosecutor, 
Arturas Paulauskas, gave the following explanation: "When 
Laurinavicius' apartment was searched TNT was discovered. He 
was arrested. I saw the TNT, there are little holes in which a 
charge can be inserted...." Actually this explanation from the 
general prosecutor made even Jonas Gyachas, deputy minister of 
national defense, smile.... 
  At the meeting Yuriy Semenovich Matochkin raised a question 
which is a painful one for the oblast today -- the question of 
the transit of freight transport across Lithuania. These and 
other questions will be discussed in Kaliningrad 24 March when a 
working group headed by Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Domarkas will arrive here. 
  And here is the official assessment of the meeting. 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius: 
  "`Selma' is carrying out a very large program of 
construction 
in Kaliningrad. The first contract concluded between the 
Russian Armed Forces leadership and the Lithuanian Government 
has already been fulfilled. Now a commercial contract is being 
fulfilled with the `Selma' association. The arrest of `Selma's' 
president worried Minister Mr. Grachev and the Kaliningrad 
Oblast and Baltic Fleet leadership. That is why today's meeting 
was necessary. We confirmed that the Lithuanian Government will 
make every effort to ensure that the construction of residential 
regions in Kaliningrad does not cease." 
  Yuriy Matochkin, head of the Kaliningrad Oblast 
administration: 
  "The aim of our trip is to convince ourselves that the 
incident involving the arrest of the `Selma' president should in 
no way influence working relations between Kaliningrad Oblast 
and the Lithuanian Republic, that the construction of the 
residential region in which the inhabitants of the oblast and 
the Lithuanians working on the construction site are both 
interested should not stop. I note with satisfaction that here 
we have encountered the understanding of Mr. prime minister." 
  Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, commander of the Baltic Fleet: 
  "`Selma' is constructing for us on credit. The fleet's debts 
to the association are about 3 billion rubles. For us it is 
important to retain the pace of construction and increase it in 
the future. And we are very distressed that this incident 
involving `Selma' President Vladas Laurinavicius has 
occurred...."

Algirdas Brazauskas on Wednesday [23 March] received Israel's 
Ambassador to Lithuania Ms. Tova Herzl. Herzl, who resides in 
Riga, also represents Israel in Latvia and Estonia. The two 
widely discussed newspaper articles, especially in the American 
press, such as "Lithuania's List" in THE WASHINGTON POST last 
week, accusing Lithuania of rehabilitating persons involved in 
genocide against Jews. 
  Justas Paleckis, the Lithuanian president's foreign policy 
adviser, said Brazauskas emphasized that several hundred people 
were denied rehabilitation. He added that a number of Nazi war 
criminals were put on trial in post-war years when it was quite 
difficult to "slip past." The Lithuanian leader said Lithuania 
is prepared to help investigate genocide against Jews, 
Lithuanians and other nations. Herzl said she is satisfied that 
persons convicted in post-war years are not rehabilitated 
automatically. 
  The president and the ambassador also discussed bilateral 
relations between their countries. Brazauskas said Tel Aviv is 
always at the top of the list when creation of new Lithuanian 
Embassies is discussed. Paleckis quoted Herzl as saying that a 
top-ranking Lithuanian official is expected to visit Israel this 
year.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Nikolay Obertyshev, 
Russia's ambassador to Lithuania, proposed a toast to "future 
NATO members" Lithuania and Russia during an official ceremony 
at the Lithuanian Defense Ministry Wednesday [21 March]. 
Colonel Nikolay Pivovarchuk, Russia's military attache, was 
introduced to Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. The 
ceremony was attended by General Jonas Andriskevicius, 
Lithuanian defense forces commander in chief, and some other 
Defense Ministry officials. 
  For three years Colonel Pivovarchuk served as the assistant 
head of the Soviet military mission in Europe and later headed a 
department of the Russian Armed Forces staff. Before his 
present appointment, Pivovarchuk was a military and political 
adviser to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. 
  The Russian military attache said his primary task in 
Lithuania will be "to develop friendship, cooperation and mutual 
understanding." In his opinion, work in this direction will not 
be affected by the recent arrest of a Lithuanian businessman 
whose company builds housing for the Russian military in the 
Kaliningrad region. Pivovarchuk said he is certain that more 
Russian military attaches will soon come to work in Lithuania 
because of its "specific character" -- many Russian citizens and 
former servicemen. 
  The Russian colonel will reside in Vilnius. He is the 16th 
foreign military attache accredited in Lithuania.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Ex-Lithuanian Defense 
Minister Audrius Butkevicius supposes that the recent search in 
his apartment, as well as the arrest of Vladas Laurinavicius, 
president of the Kaunas-based Selma association, are part of a 
defamation campaign which is already coming to light. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Tuesday, Butkevicius said 
the campaign was initiated by certain politicians who want 
deterioration of Lithuanian-Russian relations and seek to strike 
a blow to Russia's democratic forces, President Boris Yeltsin 
and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The former minister said 
businessmen who are annoyed by Selma's activities are also 
involved in the affair. Butkevicius said other motives are even 
more pragmatic. He noted that in order to complete the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuanian territory in time 
it was necessary to prove to the Russian military that every 
family would be given an apartment. But neither Lithuania nor 
Russia had money to build housing. 
  The ex-minister said an agreement was reached that the money 
paid by Lithuania for Russian weapons would be used for the 
purpose. Lithuania purchased 5,000 Russian-made automatic rifles 
and two PT boats. Russia chose Selma to build apartments by way 
of contest and agreed to transfer the money to its account. 
  Butkevicius noted that the sum paid for the weapons was 
enough to carry out only part of the housing project. In his 
words, Russia decided to find other ways of financing the 
project and agreed with Selma to barter oil for apartments. The 
former minister said a barter contract was supposed to be signed 
in Kaliningrad March 18, but the association's president was 
arrested. 
  Butkevicius said actions of the Lithuanian prosecutor's 
office clearly show that the whole case is fabricated. The 
ex-minister said everybody, including himself, found out 10 days 
in advance that searches would be carried out in apartments of 
former and present Defense Ministry employees. There were 
constant leaks of information and "even if anybody had anything, 
nothing was kept at home," he said. 
  In Butkevicius' opinion, an attempt is made to create 
tension 
in Lithuanian-Russian relations. "Everybody knows that an army, 
whose concentration in the Kaliningrad region is the biggest in 
Europe, can be involved in politics only through social 
problems." 
  The ex-minister sharply criticized activities of Prosecutor 
General Arturas Paulauskas, MP Vytautas Petkevicius, who heads 
the parliament's National Security Committee, and MP Vytautas 
Juskus, who is the head of the parliamentary economic crimes 
commission. Butkevicius said he met with Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius Monday and agreed to participate, if necessary, in 
the premier's meeting with the military and administrative 
leadership of the Kaliningrad region. "But when I found out that 
such experts as Paulauskas, Petkevicius and Juskus would take 
part -- I decided to hold aloof." 
  Butkevicius categorically denied reports that the actual 
weapon prices considerably differed from the ones indicated in 
contracts. The ex-minister said he expected a scandal and has 
documents and contracts to deny all accusations.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Ex-Lithuanian Defense 
Minister Audrius Butkevicius has publicly accused the Prosecutor 
General's Office of illegal actions against him. In a written 
statement presented to Prosecutor General Arturas Paulauskas, 
the former minister said he will use "all legal measures, 
including extreme ones" to defend himself against the 
"self-will" of the prosecutor's office. 
  In order to avoid conflicts, Butkevicius demands to stop the 
official investigation of the alleged financial violations in 
the purchase of weapons for Lithuania's defense forces in 
1992-93 and to stop legal proceedings against him. The former 
minister also demands to return the property that was seized 
during a search in his apartment. 
  Last week, over 40 searches were carried out in apartments 
of 
former and present Defense Ministry employees, including 
Butkevicius. 
  In his March 21 statement, published by the RESPUBLIKA 
newspaper Wednesday, Butkevicius said he did not commit any 
crimes during his service as defense minister. Butkevicius said 
he is prepared to explain how the weapons were bought, however 
"not as criminal, but as a former Lithuanian defense minister."

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 22, BNS -- The litas reliability law 
that was adopted last Thursday [17 March] caused quite a stir 
on the Lithuanian hard currency market. 
  The law provides for pegging the Lithuanian litas to one 
specific hard currency. According to the new law, which comes 
into effect April 1, all lits released into circulation will be 
fully backed by hard currency and gold reserves of the central 
bank. 
  On Monday, Lithuanian commercial banks virtually stopped 
selling hard currency and only some banks sold the U.S. dollar 
for 4.10 lits instead of the earlier 3.93. The exchange rate of 
other hard currencies went up by 0.02-0.05 litas. The official 
U.S. dollar rate did not change so sharply. It edged up by 
0.01 litas on Monday and by another 0.05 litas on Tuesday. 
  Trading became more active at the Lithuanian Interbank 
Currency Exchange. The volume of trade last week ran at 1-1.5 
million U.S. dollars but increased to nearly 5 million on Monday 
and topped 2.5 million on Tuesday. 
  Julius Niedvaras, president of the Lithuanian Commercial 
Banks Association, told Lithuanian TV that commercial banks are 
waiting and do not quite know how to act. In Niedvaras' 
opinion, if the litas rate against a chosen hard currency will 
be set in Lithuania, it is possible that the exchange rate will 
be around 4 lits to the U.S. dollar, but if the decision is 
made in Washington, for example, the rate may set at 3.5 lits to 
the dollar.

  [Text] Zagreb March 23 TASS -- The talks between Croats and 
Serbs that ended last night at the Russian embassy in Zagreb 
failed to bring the sides to sign an agreement on ceasefire and 
withdrawal of troops from the front line. 
  The talks will resume next week. They will be mediated by 
Russian troubleshooter Vitaliy Churkin, U.S. Ambassador to 
Croatia Peter Galbraith and EU and UN representatives. 
  In an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, 
Churkin praised the activity of the mediators whose efforts have 
helped the sides pull through the hardest stages of the talks. 
Although no formal decision was adopted, progress is obvious, 
he added. 
  Churkin said that "previously, such meetings focused only on 
local truces on the line of engagement. Now we are seeking full 
disengagement of troops to rule out aimed fire along the front 
that stretches for several hundred kilometers." 
  "The terrain where the disengagement line should run is very 
difficult, while the situation, from the military and 
psychological point of view, bears the burden of two-year 
hostilities. Considering the three-month break in the 
negotiation process, it was impossible to reach the pace 
allowing us to finish the meeting in just one day," the Russian 
diplomat said. 
  With a week to go before the next round of talks, the sides 
will iron out technical details and think over their arguments 
and position once again. 
  "Today's meeting has helped speed up the whole process of 
settlement in former Yugoslavia and I hope that this week we 
will be able to reach more progress in two directions -- the 
Bosnian issue and Serb-Croat relations," Churkin said. 
  "The discussion was rather concrete and to the point. I 
think we will be able to maintain this approach at the second 
round of talks scheduled for March 29," he concluded.

  [Text] Barnaul March 24 TASS -- "There were no apparent 
reasons for the air crash near Mezhdurechensk," ITAR-TASS was 
told by Sergey Shoigu, Russian minister for civil defence, 
emergency situations and natural calamities, who is now in 
Barnaul. According to Shoigu, the plane did not transmit any 
S.O.S. signals and did not report on any faulty equipment. 
  "We have been to the crash area," the minister said, "and, 
judging by the trace left by the plane, it fell without gliding, 
right down. A commission is now working on the spot. Our 
central mobile rescue team, a special company and regiment, some 
cross-country vehicles and helicopters, have already arrived 
there. According to last minute information, two flight 
recorders were found today at 6 hours 40 minutes moscow time. 
Both are deformed. Remains of the crew were found at 7 hours 45 
minutes. Fifteen bodies were taken away from the crash area. 
Most of them can be identified.

  [Excerpts] Moscow, 23 Mar -- Rescue teams are carrying out 
an on-the-spot investigation of the burnt-out debris of the 
Aeroflot Airbus A-310-300 which crashed last night near 
Mezhdurechensk in Kuzbass and measures are being taken to find 
out what caused the airliner, regarded as one of the world's 
safest planes, to crash. [passage omitted] 
  Representatives of the Russian airlines' ground services 
state that no technical malfunction was registered on board the 
airliner prior to its flight. This is the reason why foreign 
news agencies speak of an act of subversion on board the plane. 
Some local residents, who saw and heard a mid-air explosion, 
are also of the same view. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS 21/3/1994 -- President Mircea 
Snegur today announced a decree "on several measures for the 
improvement of the state of things in industry." The decree is 
issued "in order to improve the financial situation and create 
favourable conditions for the development of industry." It 
provides that "industrial enterprises and organizations can put 
on the market at free (negotiable) prices raw materials, 
additional compounds and, with the consent of the respective 
organ of the major state administration and of the State 
Property Fund, equipment and transport means not engaged in the 
technological process, taking into account their real value. 
Means obtained from their sale will be added to the circulating 
means." Article 2 of the decree stipulates that "industrial 
enterprises and organizations not subjected to privatization, as 
well as those proposed for partial privatization through the 
vouchers of their employees, are allowed to market unfinished 
non-productive objects, with the consent of the State Property 
Fund." Profits collected from their sale will be used "to 
restore the financial resources for building such objects." 
Article 3 says that "goods delivered under barter and in 
cooperation with CIS states and Romania are exported without 
license." It also stipulates that "until June 1st 1994 excises 
for Moldovan production are levied at the level of 50 percent of 
the established rates." Enterprises and organizations should pay 
salaries to their employees according to the situation on March 
1st. The Moldovan National Bank, "together with the 
government," should elaborate and present proposals on the 
manner of reciprocal compensation of debts between Moldovan 
enterprises and organizations; this should include the mechanism 
of their amortization through the promissory note system. The 
National Bank must also decide within one week whether to leave 
the industrial enterprises and organizations part of the 
financial dividends from the sale of production or rendering of 
services. According to the decree, the government will present 
the parliament proposals on the introduction of amendments into 
legislative acts regarding taxes that would establish 
differentiated value added tax on products manufactured in 
prioritized branches of the economy. The government should 
provide fiscal privileges to stimulate producers to increase the 
volume of production. In five days, the government is to cancel 
its normative acts regarding the levying of taxes without the 
consent of the taxpayer.

  [Text] Baku March 24 TASS -- Chairman of the Supreme Soviet 
of the Azeri Republic Rasul Guliyev, who addressed a session of 
the National Assembly (Parliament) here today, described the 
situation in Azerbaijan as very grave. He said this was 
explained by the war that is continuing on the territory of 
Azerbaijan, by the crisis in the national economy, which is on 
the verge of bankruptcy, and also by actions of various 
political groupings, trying to destabilise the internal 
political situation. 
  In order to pull the republic out of the crisis, Guliyev 
believes, it is necessary to take urgent measures in two 
directions: To urgently end the war in a way that would fully 
guarantee the national interests of Azerbaijan, and to get down 
to economic reforms. He stressed that the republic's leadership 
remained dedicated to the peaceful settlement of the 
Armenian-Azeri conflict. Guliyev expressed the hope that the 
talks between the conflicting sides, currently under way in 
Moscow with the mediation of Russia and the CSCE, would yield 
concrete results. Guliyev also informed the parliament on the 
intention of the Azeri leadership to take resolute steps to 
strengthen law and order in Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: by Nikolay </F>
Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] The head of the Russian presidential administration 
Sergey Filatov has told Interfax that his meeting late on Monday 
with the Chechen State Secretary Aslanbek Akbulatov helped to 
finalize the stand of Groznyy that is suggesting its own version 
of the friendship and cooperation treaty with Russia. 
  Filatov thinks Moscow should not hurry with the meeting of 
the presidents of the two sides before the package of documents 
Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev are to discuss is fully 
ready. IF Note: Earlier a high-ranking source in the 
administration of the Russian president claimed that serious 
talks with Chechnya would be held, if the leadership of the 
republic in the Northern Caucasus fulfilled two conditions put 
forward by Moscow: stopped accusing Russia of imperial 
ambitions and used the treaty signed with Tataria [Tatar 
Republic] on the separation of powers as the basis for the 
Moscow meeting. 
  Filatov said he informed Akbulatov about the results of the 
consultations between the speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin 
and the Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey 
Shakhray based on the assumption that relations with Chechnya 
will become a subject of parliamentary hearings. 
  Earlier the chairman of the Council of the Federation 
Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that the upper house would discuss 
the issue no matter whether the lower house deals with it or not. 
  "The council should represent all members of the Federation. 
It is impossible to say that Chechnya is not a member of the 
Russian Federation because there have been no laws on its 
separation", Shumeyko said. 
  The only expression of the attitude of the federal 
authorities to Chechnya, according to him, is a resolution 
passed by the Supreme Soviet or the Congress of People's 
Deputies invalidating the results of presidential elections in 
Chechnya. The council can discuss the resolution and raise the 
question of abolishing it and recognizing the election results, 
Shumeyko said. 
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Chechen parliament Akhyad 
Idigov has said in an interview with Interfax in Groznyy that 
the summit is necessary for stabilizing bilateral relations. 
  Commenting on the Moscow visit by the Chechen state 
secretary 
Idigov said that the talks between Russia and Chechnya are a 
continuation of the constructive work in which both sides are 
interested. "Chechnya has not stopped active efforts to 
continue the process of negotiations with the Russian leadership 
because we are interested in normalizing both political and 
economic ties with Russia", Idigov said. 
  On the political situation in Chechnya Idigov said it is 
relatively stable even considering the relations between 
different political forces. He claimed that the economic 
situation has improved considerably. "All the rest will depend 
on what our relations with Russia are going to be like", Idigov 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Arkadiy Kramarev, chief of the City Internal </F>
Affairs Administration, by Andrey Potapenko under the rubric 
"First Hand"; place and date not given: "I Leave Without 
Disgrace"] 
  [Text] [Potapenko] Arkadiy Grigoryevich, a couple of days 
ago you returned from Moscow where you met with Internal Affairs 
Minister V.F. Yerin. What did you discuss? 
  [Kramarev] The minister announced his decision to send me 
into retirement. I will not discuss this and I do not intend to 
do anything to oppose this intention in any way. 
  [Potapenko] What reasons did the minister give for retiring 
you? 
  [Kramarev] The discussion was mainly about the high level of 
crime in St. Petersburg and the fact that the measures taken by 
the GUVD [City Administration of Internal Affairs] were 
inadequate. A number of other complaints were made as well. 
For example, we discussed a letter sent by the city's mayor, A. 
Sobchak, to the president in which he insisted on my retirement 
and referred to the exceptionally grave crime situation in the 
city. In passing, the minister mentioned that I had had 
difficult relations with the mayor's office. And he thinks that 
these relations sometimes do harm to the cause. 
  [Potapenko] Expressing his complaints, the mayor recently 
spoke also of the notion that the GUVD chief was too politicized. 
  [Kramarev] Yes, and as an example he referred to the fact 
that I was nominated by three electoral blocs in the elections 
to the City Assembly. But they did not coordinate this with me. 
Moreover, after the well known directive from Sobchak I 
rejected these proposals. Nor was the mayor pleased by the fact 
that a number of individuals who are friends of our high-ranking 
bureaucrats were arrested recently. But, obviously, if we 
arrest someone, we do not think about whose friend they are but 
about whether there is serious evidence of their guilt. 
Moreover, if Kharchenko, Aleksandrov, or Kisilev were on the 
mayor's team, that cannot be said, for example, about Bondarenko. 
  [Potapenko] At the meeting with the minister, did you 
discuss 
your future? 
  [Kramarev] Viktor Fedorovich behaved like a gentleman. In 
the first place, he promised me that the documentation on my 
retirement would not mention any failures in my work. So I am 
leaving without disgrace. 
  Second, I was offered a chance to remain in the ministry and 
do teaching work. He mentioned the Higher School of the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Legal Institute. 
Incidentally, I have had other offers as well. For example, to 
be in charge of a Cossack squadron. So maybe I will be a 
squadron leader. But, seriously, I have not thought about the 
future yet--it is difficult to shift gears so quickly. 
  [Potapenko] There has been a lot of discussion about your 
possible successor. 
  [Kramarev] One of the candidates mentioned to me was Yuriy 
Nikolayevich Loskutov, the chief of the fire safety school. I 
do not know him well enough. At one time he was in the main 
administration in charge of the work of the state automotive 
inspection, and then he left us. I think he would have a 
difficult time in this post since here every day it is necessary 
to resolve a multitude of problems related to operational 
investigative work, and he has no experience in that. I do not 
know why he in particular was mentioned as a possible candidate, 
and I do not want to guess. 
  [Potapenko] A couple of days ago on the program "Fakt" we 
heard that the citywide operation "Signal" is nothing but show 
for the purpose of making General Kramarev look good. 
  [Kramarev] It was a planned measure for which we prepared 
for 
several months. The Good Will Games will begin soon and we will 
be gradually increasing our efforts to make sure that everything 
is peaceful on the streets of St. Petersburg. And the fact that 
about 1,000 people have been assigned to us from other 
regions--this is an absolutely normal phenomenon. When similar 
measures were conducted in Vorkuta or Syktyvkar, we sent people 
there. So there is nothing showy here. [end Kramarev] 
  P.S. Another brief commentary on Arkadiy Kramarev's 
retirement was given to the NEVSKOYE VREMYA correspondent by the 
deputy minister of internal affairs of Russia, Colonel General 
A.N. Kulikov, who is in St. Petersburg in connection with the 
"Signal" operation: 
  "It is difficult to give a direct evaluation to the work of 
General Kramarev. He has more than 20,000 people under him and 
he is responsible for the peace and quiet of an immense 
megalopolis. And it happens that the leader is responsible for 
shortcomings in the subdivisions. I have normal business 
relations with Arkadiy Grigoryevich, but we have the minister 
over us, and in this case the mayor as well. And there is 
nothing that can be done here.

  [Text] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev believes that 
the situation in Tajikistan can be settled only by political 
means. Upon his arrival Wednesday, he expressed hope that with 
the mediation of Russia the talks between the authorities of 
Tajikistan and the opposition leaders will lead to accord and 
peace in this Central Asian republic. 
  Answering the questions put by Interfax, Grachev backed 
further protection of the Tajik-Afghan border by collective 
efforts of CIS peacekeepers. 
  He said though that he expressed the view of a military man 
since the solution of the problem is solely within the 
competence of political leaders of the CIS states. 
  The term of the Russian troops in the republic expires on 
December 31, 1994, in line with the understanding between 
Dushanbe and Moscow. 
  Grachev believes that the protection of the Tajik-Afghan 
border meets the interests of Russia's security, as well as of 
the 200,000-strong Russian-speaking population. 
  Grachev said that during his meetings in Dushanbe with the 
Tajik leadership he intends to discuss the military-political 
situation in the republic. 
  Grachev arrived in Tajikistan to take part in the military 
exercises which are being held near the Tajik-Afghan border. 
Taking part are units of the 201st Russian Infantry division, 
Russian border guards, military units of Tajikistan and Uzbek 
peacekeepers. 
  Grachev said that taking part in the exercises are about 50 
warplanes, 300 units of various military technology, 100 
artillery pieces and mortars, 60 air defence weapons and about 
2000 servicemen.

  [Text] A news conference was organized in the Seimas today 
by Ambassador Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the group for 
negotiations with the CIS countries, and financial and economic 
expert members of the group. 
  Assessing the meeting of the Lithuanian and Russian 
negotiators in Moscow, Bulovas mentioned that the stand of the 
Russian delegation has become tougher than before. As already 
reported, an inter-state agreement on the border crossing points 
was prepared for initialling. The Lithuanian delegation 
submitted to the Russian delegation a list of debts to 
Lithuanian enterprises and organizations by Russian military 
units. 
  It was agreed in Moscow that experts of both countries will 
continue negotiations in April on transit by road and rail. The 
Lithuanian and Russian customs experts will also meet in April. 
  Virgilijus Bulovas said that, when discussing the problem of 
military transit, it was explained to the Russian delegation 
that the regulations and status of such transit, as applied in 
Lithuania, are the same for all countries. They will be 
endorsed by the Seimas and will have the power of law. 
  Members of the Russian delegation stated that there is no 
intention to return archives removed from Lithuania. According 
to Virgilijus Bulovas, the Lithuanian group will try to ensure 
that the discussion on this issue continues. The next meeting 
of the Lithuanian and Russian delegations is scheduled for early 
May.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Russia's positions have 
become firmer, Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the Lithuanian 
working group for talks with the CIS, said on his return from a 
two-day round of talks in Moscow. 
  During their meeting in the Russian capital Monday [21 
March] 
and Tuesday, Lithuanian and Russian negotiation teams 
initialled a bilateral agreement on border crossings. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday, Bulovas said the 
Lithuanian group paid primary attention to the implementation of 
the Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed last November and the 
fate of Lithuanian savings kept in the former Vneshekonombank 
and the Soviet Savings Bank. 
  The Lithuanian negotiator said the Russian delegation 
focused 
on problems related to the Kaliningrad region. In Bulovas' 
words, his Russian counterpart Viktor Isakov complained of a 
number of problems as if encountered by the region, but when a 
separate group discussed Kaliningrad matters, only two problems 
remained -- customs duties and Russian transit through Lithuania 
by rail and by road. Both issues should be discussed in April, 
the Lithuanian diplomat said. 
  Russia also raised the problem of military transit. The 
Lithuanian group said there are no intentions to sign a military 
transit agreement, but there will be transit regulations 
instead. The Russian side said it would like experts to hold 
consultations on military transit in May. This request was 
registered in the meeting's protocol but Lithuania did not 
promise anything, Bulovas said. 
  Lithuanian negotiator Raimondas Barcevicius, who deals with 
commercial and economic matters, said presidents may have to 
intervene to achieve enforcement of economic and commercial 
treaties. Barcevicius said the agreement on the most favored 
nation trade status does not function because it has not been 
ratified by Russia. Moreover, he said, export to Russia became 
even more difficult in March when Russia changed its customs 
regulations. In Barcevicius' opinion, it becomes useless for 
Lithuania to renew its agreement with the Moscow city 
administration. 
  The negotiator said Russia uses its new parliament as a 
cover 
to link the ratification of the most favored nation trade status 
agreement with a number of other problems. 
  Barcevicius said similar problems are encountered in dealing 
with the return of lost savings. Ricardas Seidelis, also a 
member of the Lithuanian group, said Russia tries to link the 
return of savings with the problem of covering internal debts of 
the former Soviet Union. 
  Seidelis said Russia's reaction was stormy when Lithuanian 
negotiators noted the matter might be referred to international 
arbitration. In his words, the Russian delegation immediately 
assured that the problem can be solved without any international 
interference.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Vice-Premier Irina Sarishvili, </F>
leading member of the National-Democratic Party (NDP), 
Parliament Deputy Speaker Vakhtang Rcheulishvili by Tinatin 
Gviniashvili; place and date not given: "Will International 
Experts Be Summoned?"] 
  [Text]At one of the recent sessions of the Georgian 
Parliament, Irina Sarishvili, a deputy from the NDP, stated that 
the ratification of the agreement on Georgia joining the CIS was 
illegal. The view was also expressed that it was necessary to 
summon international experts in order to establish the legality 
of this act. 
  We met with Irina Sarishvili and Parliament Deputy Speaker 
Vakhtang Rcheulishvili and asked them to comment on the 
situation that has taken shape. 
  [Sarishvili] Yes, we delivered our statement on the 
illegality of the ratification of the agreement on Georgia 
joining the CIS. 
  As for inviting international experts, this has been 
insisted 
upon by the representatives of both the majority and the 
minority in Parliament. However, I know that, even if the 
conclusions of the experts are in our favor, this will 
essentially not change anything. I hope that our statement will 
serve the future when Georgia will once more be given the chance 
to acquire independence. In its time, in 1921, the Georgian 
Government, which we often curse, did not sign the treaty on 
Georgia joining Russia, which is now identical to joining the 
CIS. Therefore, for a long time, Georgia was not a legal part 
of the USSR. If there had been no ratification on 1 March, this 
fact would have given us the chance to acquire a status similar 
to that held by the Baltic republics. 
  What is most surprising is not so much that the agreement on 
Georgia joining the CIS was ratified but that this step was 
proclaimed as the only means by which Georgia can emerge from 
the serious situation in which it finds itself today, the sole 
reason for which, so it is claimed, is the complication of 
relations with Russia. However, we are inclined to believe that 
80 percent of all the misfortunes have been conditioned by 
internal state policy. 
  [Rcheulishvili] I consider it wholly legitimate to call upon 
international experts to act as arbitrators. The arrival of 
international experts will benefit both the opposition and those 
not in opposition. The more frequently we have contacts with 
professionals, the better this will be for our Parliament in 
general.... 
  As regards the possible results of their work, they will not 
be able to change the decision that has been adopted. 
  It is a great pity that Parliament lacks the institution of 
the constitutional court to whom parliamentarians who are 
dissatisfied with something could appeal. I hope that this 
fact, which is necessary for the normal work of Parliament, will 
be taken into account in the new constitution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 22 March; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [The interview follows a news item on Butrus Ghali's 
report submitted to the UN Security Council on the inexpediency 
of sending peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia] 
  [Announcer] In this connection Eduard Shevardnadze yesterday 
gave an interview to Georgian television. Here is the recording. 
  [Shevardnadze] I do not think that we are talking about the 
Security Council here, I mean the document that was circulated 
by the secretary general in the Security Council. As for the 
Security Council, it has not convened and has not discussed the 
report. 
  Now, about the document itself. I read it this evening [22 
March], and to be absolutely honest, I did not want to comment 
in detail because the forecast is such that...[Shevardnadze 
pauses]...there are some clauses and regulations that do not 
quite inspire hope but there are some promising ones too. 
Therefore, I am for studying every possibility and weighing up 
every word and only then should we assess this document. Thus, 
we must not be guided by the first impression. This document is 
more profound than it seems to be, although, as I said, it is 
not hope inspiring. 
  [Correspondent] Did parliament's recent decision on Abkhazia 
influence this document? Why do you think this document was 
drawn up at all? 
  [Shevardnadze] I would say that there was no immediate 
influence but the fact remains that the Abkhaz side used this 
instance for wrecking negotiations. Adopting a decision 
according to clause 6 at the Security Council, there must be, 
first, consent from both sides, and second, some progress during 
negotiations. The delegations were about to reach this point, 
and if not in New York, then at the next round, some progress 
would probably be reached either in connection with the return 
of refugees or any other issue. But they [the Abkhaz side] used 
it [parliament's decision] and it had a considerable influence 
[on wrecking negotiations]. 
  I said after my arrival from New York that a U.S. 
representative in the Security Council told me that this 
decision was wrong. According to the contents, everything is 
correct, but when the negotiations were being held and the issue 
was being discussed in the Security Council, it played a serious 
and negative role. 
  [Correspondent] Lastly, do you think that after [words 
indistinct] time come to refuse a peaceful settlement of this 
conflict, to be more accurate, has it turned out that the course 
for a peaceful settlement of the conflict is fruitless? 
  [Shevardnadze] It is a very difficult question. The answer 
will probably be the following: In order to come to the 
conclusion that the course -- with the interference of the 
United Nations, the United Nation's participation, and Russia's 
mediation to settle the conflict in a political manner -- turned 
out to be unsuccessful and failed, it is premature and hasty to 
draw such a conclusion. Neither does this report give grounds 
for drawing such a conclusion. All the more so, it is good that 
we recorded it [the UN Security Council session] and television 
viewers could see and listen to every speech by the members of 
the Security Council; there was total unanimity for the 
viewpoint that Georgia needs help and that the peacekeeping 
forces must be sent in. Therefore, we must wait for the 
Security Council session before we jump to serious conclusions. 
Maybe one session will not be enough. 
  Those who know the principle of how the UN works, they will 
agree with me that it fails to adopt operational decisions -- 
that the United Nations finds it difficult. I think that 
Georgia did everything it could, that is, using ways for a 
peaceful settlement in every possible way and every channel. I 
said in my Monday interview that there are three ways of sending 
in peacekeeping troops; classical ways; [words indistinct] the 
second variant is the Russian contingent under the UN banner, 
which is a bit doubtful although Yeltsin and I agree on this 
variant in principle. Another variant is [word indistinct] and 
Russian contingent on the basis of a bilateral agreement. These 
are the variants and probably it will take some time. I stress 
that UN participation and Russian mediation -- this course has 
not yet been fully exhausted.

Georgia and Abkhazia along the River Inguri near the village of 
Otobaya. 
  Georgian military activity was also reported in the upper 
reaches of the River Inguri. The Abkhazian armed forces are 
rebuffing the attacks.

was ready to resume its dialogue with Georgia, but not before 
the latter repealed its March 10 decision to disband Abkhazia's 
legislature and government. 
  "The resumption of war in Abkhazia will hardly be possible 
if 
the Georgian leadership takes a reasonable path," Ardzinba told 
Interfax and Abkhazian television on Wednesday. He reiterated 
the Abkhazian leadership's demand that a U.N. peacekeeping force 
be deployed only along the Inguri River, marking the border 
between Abkhazia and Georgia. 
  Ardzinba said the leaders of the republics and regions of 
southern Russia and Abkhazia would be meeting in the Russian 
city of Krasnodar early next month. He expressed gratitude to 
the city's administration for organizing the meeting, which he 
expected to focus, among other things, on the problem of the 
border between Abkhazia and Russia.

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Flame of New Conflict Smoldering </F>
in Georgia"] 
  [Text] Baku -- Georgian-Azerbaijani relations may 
deteriorate drastically owing to the situation that has 
developed in areas densely populated by Azerbaijanis. There is 
no end to attacks by armed gangs demanding large ransoms for 
hostages taken from among the civilian population. Schools and 
apartment blocks are being set on fire. There have been plenty 
of killings. Muggings alternate with car thefts. The armed 
formations looting and pillaging in South Ossetia and Abkhazia 
seem to now be exploring new territory -- parts of Georgia that 
have been settled since time immemorial by the 500,000-strong 
Azerbaijani community. 
  In the past Zviad Gamsakhurdia was keen on Georgianizing 
this 
area, freeing the hands of the "bandit formations" who began 
getting rich by looting and pillaging. The Azerbaijanis 
suffered least during the Georgian wars of the last few years 
and were partially able to retain their possessions. But, in 
the past year alone, 65 Azerbaijanis from Dmanisi, Marneuli, and 
Bolnisi have been abducted. 
  The fight against the armed gangs has been stepped up 
following intervention by the Azerbaijani leadership and 
vigorous measures by Georgian Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze. 
However, Georgia's Azerbaijani communities think that one-shot 
actions cannot solve these problems since it is not only radical 
nationalists, but also outside forces trying to complicate the 
situation in Georgia with "another Karabakh" that have an 
interest in the confrontation. 
  The situation in the region has had a palpable impact 
primarily on the Georgian economy. Azerbaijanis cannot 
cultivate the land under the barrel of a gun and the fields have 
not been sown. The market has lost an appreciable amount of 
food. Gangs are active on the highways linking the 
"Azerbaijani" regions with Tbilisi and Baku, and the Georgian 
militia itself is not averse to exacting dues from the peasants 
and confiscating produce. 
  Observers think it extremely dubious that the Georgian 
authorities are capable of imposing order in the region given 
the chaos reigning in the country. The Azerbaijanis are asking 
Heydar Aliyev to help and vigorously defend his compatriots. 
The situation has not improved even after Eduard Shevardnadze 
received a group of Azerbaijani elders. Leaders of Azerbaijan's 
political parties are voicing fears that the situation itself 
will force the Azerbaijanis to take up arms in order to defend 
their families.

<F P=106> [Article by Maia Gogoladze: "Centrist Forces Have No </F>
Alternative But To Unite...."; passages between slantlines 
published in boldface] 
  [Excerpts] Nodar Natadze [chairman of the Georgian 
Popular Front]: "A centrist position does not mean standing 
between those on the right and those on the left, between one 
extreme and the other. A centrist position is one that views 
the central question of the construction of the state." 
  Irakli Shengelaia [leader of the Christian-Democratic Party 
(CDP]): "The chief characteristic feature of a centrist force, 
apart from political tactics, is political language. A centrist 
never operates using such concepts as `traitor to the nation,' 
`agent,' and `turncoat.'" 
  Davit Berdzenishvili [leading member of the Republican 
Party]: "The democratic center is creating more problems today 
for Georgia's leadership than the radically-minded wing." 
  Tedo Paatashvili [leader of "Charter-91"]: "In a war 
situation, the country's political center cannot be viewed as 
the center according to the traditional meaning of this word. 
The situation that has taken shape in the country is definitely 
pushing it toward radicalis. [Passage omitted] 
  As can be seen, new elections are not far off. Probably, the 
most well-defined centrist forces are the Republican Party and 
the Popular Front that will again contest the elections 
together. Realistically speaking, however, there are four 
forces amongst whom seats will be distributed at Georgia's 
future elections. These forces are: The Union of Georgia's 
Citizens [led by Shevardnadze], the Liberal-Conservative 
coalition, the Republican Party, and the National-Democratic 
Party [NDP]. 
  The Republican Party is today creating serious problems for 
Shevardnadze's government. It is opposing the latter more 
fiercely than the radically-minded wing. Davit Berdzenishvili, 
one of the leaders of the Republican Party, explains the 
mechanism that has come to power today as follows: "After 9 
April [1989, when Soviet soldiers forcibly dispersed a peaceful 
demonstration killing some 20 civilians], opposition to the 
communist regime was conducted in the name of Gamsakhurdia. The 
communist regime in those republics of the former Soviet Union 
where it was impossible for the Communist Party to remain in 
power gave way to such forces that were unable to govern the 
country and, following their collapse, a transformed communist 
nomenklatura assumed the reins of power. It was not possible 
for such a scenario to be played out in the Baltic states, but 
it was implemented with great success in Georgia. Therefore, 
the fresh victory for Brazauskas does not signify the 
strengthening of the pro-Russian orientation in Lithuania. 
However, Shevardnadze's arrival in power in Georgia means 
precisely this. Moreover, he has confirmed this by his own 
actions." 
It could not happen in Lithuania because of the strength 
of the democratic centrist wing and the existence of social 
strata supporting it. Reform really got started there and the 
principles of a market economy were put into action. The 
country gradually distanced itself from Russia and integrated 
itself with the West. Therefore, both the success of Brazauskas 
in Lithuania and the success of leftist forces based on the 
former Communist Party in Poland in no way create a threat to 
the sovereignty of these countries. As regards their foreign 
policy and relations with Russia, they are as principled as, 
say, Walesa and Landsbergis were. 
  Events in Georgia have developed differently. Centrist 
forces and the social strata supporting them are in the process 
of being formed. The political spectrum is now being cleansed 
and extended. From this point of view, the creation of the Union 
of Georgia's Citizens has fulfilled a certain positive role. 
The Republican Party assesses this event as a normal political 
process. 
  Davit Berdzenishvili: "The creation of a political 
organization around the figure of the head of state will 
contribute to the cleansing of the political spectrum. 
Belonging to such a political organization, which, to all 
intents and purposes, is leading the country, determining cadres 
policy, has a monopoly on the mass media, and has brought the 
youth movement under its influence, places certain 
responsibilities upon its members. If the Shevardnadze factor 
were to lose its appeal tomorrow, a certain number of his 
supporters would follow him. Such is the logic of the political 
process. It is only unfortunate that a large number of the 
leaders of our (?student) movement [word indistinct] nourished 
in both the material and political sense of this word. It is 
some consolation that this does not apply to everyone." 
  The creation of the Liberal-Conservative coalition has also 
contributed to the tidying-up of the political spectrum. The 
coalition views itself as a centrist formation, although it is 
difficult to say how centrist the Merab Kostava Society is, 
which is part of the coalition. The Republican Party does not 
view the coalition as belonging to the center although it 
recognizes that the organizations within it -- the Ilia 
Chavchavadze Society and "Charter-91" -- clearly manifest 
centrist tendencies. The Union of Traditionalists, however, 
will not oppose the center. The view exists that the 
"coalition" will form itself as the right wing. It is not 
excluded that this political union will split into two. 
  As always, the political steps taken by the NDP are 
interesting and original. The National-Democrats expressed the 
wish that the NDP declare itself as a centrist organization. 
They have said several times that the NDP occupies the center 
of the political spectrum. It is clear to everyone that the 
NDP, given the mentality, tactics, and political language and 
skills that characterize it, will never attach itself to the 
center. This party's situation will be quite complex at the 
next elections. The NDP is not detached from the Shevardnadze 
factor. Naturally, the NDP will try to appear as an independent 
political force and it will try, during the election campaign, 
to use those steps that the party took to disassociate itself 
clearly from Shevardnadze's policy. During the last few months, 
the National-Democrats have been less active in Parliament and 
Giorgi Chanturia himself appears as the party's leader. 
[sentence as published] This is probably a tactical step. As 
can be seen, the National-Democrats want to preserve their 
equilibrium before the new elections. They will try to ensure 
that the NDP is not perceived as the alternative to Shevardnadze 
so as not to inflict a major blow upon themselves. However, at 
the same time, it is not in their interests to appear once more 
in the role of the young friends of the central figure, Eduard 
Shevardnadze. 
  If a change of positions and partners is not alien to the 
National-Democrats, they could propose the next metamorphosis to 
their own electorate after the new elections. In general, as my 
respected colleague would have said, the NDP and its leader (we 
will not specify which) are amazingly principled and aggressive 
in their lack of principle. Therefore, it will be quite 
difficult for the electorate to trust this party and its leaders. 
  The CDP was formed as a centrist force. It is centrist both 
in its mentality and tactics and in its attitude toward key 
questions concerning the construction of the state. It is 
another question how effective this force is. There is no doubt 
that the efficiency of centrist forces would have doubled, if 
they had united in a form acceptable to each one of them. The 
CDP leader Irakli Shengelaia does not deny that a weakness of 
these forces is their fragmentation. There is almost no 
question on which the CDP and the Republican Party would not be 
able to reach a consensus. Batoni Irakli Shengelaia says that 
they have to move toward one another. It would be better if 
these steps were taken right now. 
  The attitude of the Union of Traditionalists toward centrism 
is very interesting. It is difficult for us to deny that this 
political force is not centrist in its origins. However, it is 
also difficult to deny that the Traditionalists' wing is, 
according to its tactics, almost moderate policies, and 
constructivism, satisfying a whole number of serious demands of 
the center. 
  "Charter-91" is clearly perceived by the Georgian political 
spectrum as a centrist-oriented political organization. This 
organization has more than once been given the chance to affirm 
its centrist reputation. However, Tedo Paatashvili, the leader 
of "Charter-91," believes that, in a war situation, the 
country's political center is permitted to manifest a certain 
radicalism. 
The fragmentation of centrist forces in Georgia has its 
internal logic and is due not only to subjective reasons. The 
self-declared center is more radical than forces that are 
recognized as being radical and is creating far more problems 
for the authorities than the latter. Certain right-wing forces 
are displaying moderation and the desire to cooperate of which 
the center is envious. The centrist forces differ according to 
their political origins, mentality, and world outlook; they also 
differ according to their attitude toward a whole number of 
questions concerning the construction of the state. In spite of 
everything, there is probably no alternative to the unification 
of centrist forces. The future of the country depends on these 
forces as there are no other reformist-minded forces in Georgia. 
There centrist reformist forces have a single social base, more 
precisely, the embryo of a social base -- business circles that, 
no matter by what means they have collected their capital, are 
in need of assistance and protection as far as their own 
financial and economic activities are concerned. 
  As regards the elections, it is very difficult to make 
any forecasts concerning the Georgian population. However, one 
thing can be said without difficulty: The centrist forces will 
have a future provided they realistically propose something to 
the electorate and show that their own activities hold some 
prospects.

  [Text] The British specialists are willing to contribute 
to the forming of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Defence 
Minister Indrek Kannik announced yesterday after meeting the 
British military attache to the Baltic states Janis Kazocins. A 
group of British experts is to arrive on 18 April to hold a 
seminar on relations between military and civilian authorities. 
A joint delegation of British and Nordic military lawyers will 
arrive on 25 April to make recommendations on the legal basis 
for the Baltic battalion. Kannik stressed the importance of the 
legal aid since Estonia has no specialists of its own in that 
field.

  [Text] The first exercises of collective peacekeeping 
forces in the history of the CIS took place in a bend of the 
rivers Vakhsh and Pyandzh near the Tajik-Afghan border. Taking 
part in them were units of the 201st Russian divisions, subunits 
of the Armed Forces of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and the Russian 
border troops, a total of about 2,000 personnel. 
  Under the overall leadership of Russia's Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, the troops repelled attacks made by a designated 
opponent towards the town of Kurgan-Tyube then went over onto 
the attack and expelled the opponent from Tajik territory. 
  The head of the Russian military department gave a high 
assessment of the combat training and the coordination of the 
actions of the various units of the peace-keeping forces and 
specially emphasized that these were planned exercises and not 
in any way a demonstration of strength or anything similar. 
  Fortunately war, even in training, ends sooner or later and 
the soldiers who were tired by the temperature of 28 degrees 
could relax a little. Those who had proved most worthy were 
presented with orders and medals and the songs introduced 
pleasant variety into service life. 
  In the afternoon the Defense Minister went to Farkhar 
[Parkhar], a rayon center in Khatlon Oblast where he was made an 
honorary citizen yesterday. Pavel Grachev made an unofficial 
approach towards this a year ago when he ordered an aircraft to 
be sent there with medicines and doctors in order to halt an 
epidemic of a very severe form of hepatitis which affected 
almost half the town's inhabitants. There were gifts this time, 
too. The local hospital was given 5,000 disposable syringes. 
  Summing up the results of his trip, Pavel Grachev said that 
the exercises showed that the treaty on the collective security 
of CIS countries was already operating, although not to the 
desired extent. He said that this was because the Armies of the 
majority of the states which had signed this document in 
Tashkent were still in the stage of being set up. Touching on 
the stay of Russian troops in Tajikistan, a subject which many 
find painful, the Defense Minister said that it was better to 
ensure the country's security on distant frontiers and the most 
important thing was that Russia did not have the moral right to 
abandon the 200,000 ethnic Russians living there to their fate.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 25 March (TASS) -- ROSSIISKIYE VESTI on the 
discussion of draft federal budget by the State Duma: 
  "The Duma has made a really fabulous present to the cabinet 
of Viktor Chernomyrdin by allowing to grant a credit of 
10,600,000 million roubles to the government in the second 
quarter of this year on a 10-year instalment plan, beginning 
from 1998, at ten percent at annum, to offset the federal budget 
deficit". 
  The newspaper's opinion is that the draft budget plan is 
subject to an endorsement procedure which, according to expert 
estimates, may continue for several months. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) carries an 
interview with Latvian Deputy Defence Minister Dainis Turlais, 
who particiates in the Russo-Latvian inter-state talks. 
  Turlais visualises cooperation between Latvia and Russia 
only 
within the framework of civilised state relations. He pointed 
out as follows: 
  "Some people both in Russia and Latvia try to substitute 
power politics for a normal relationship" or "try to play on 
national feelings. One should not rake up old grievances or 
look for some scheming in each other's policies. 
  "At this difficult time, errors are inevitable on one and 
the 
other side. One must realise that we -- two neighbouring states 
-- can do a lot of useful things for each other." 
  The Latvian deputy defence minister spoke about the 
development of national defence forces, military cooperation 
among the three Baltic countries, and the republic's 
participation in the partnership-for-peace programme. 
  In NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Konstantin Zatulin, a member of the 
State Duma and chairman of the committee for CIS affairs and 
relations with compatriots, recognises it necessary "now that 
the country is experiencing a hard political and economic 
crisis, to get agreement on politicial struggle conditions which 
the main political forces would agree not to break," and, for 
the sake of achieving national concord "to forget what divided 
these forces in the past." 
  Zatulin sees a way out of the economic crisis first of all 
in 
changing the taxation system. The point is, without reducing 
the already dramatically slashed expenditure on social needs, to 
move from draconian taxes and a narrow taxation basis to sparing 
taxes and, accordingly, a broad basis of their application." 
  "It is essential to reduce budget deficit through the 
placement of securities and to hold out until funds start to 
come in as a result of the expansion of the taxation basis and 
the tightening of tax discipline" 
  In IZVESTIYA, prominent eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fedorov, who 
organised a highly profitable eye microsurgery joint-stock 
company, sees a way out of the current critical situation in the 
Russian economy primarily in the establishment of closed-type 
joint-stock companies where shares are distributed among 
producers depending on seniority and salary, and with a transfer 
of all means of production to the work collectives. 
  Fedorov also points out the need to abolish a profit tax, 
freeze the export of raw materials and sell them to domestic 
producers at frozen prices lower than world ones, and exempt 
investments from taxes for several years until the producer 
becomes independent and repays the debts. 
  IZVESTIYA on a "Coup Scenario No.2" anonymous message with a 
false fax number: 
  "A `Coup Scenario No.2' Anonymous Message With a False Fax 
Number of Sender is Out and Reaches High Places" is the headline 
of an article by Vladimir Ivanidze, who comments on the second 
anonymous message the text of which reached the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA 
(COMMON NEWSPAPER) last Friday. 
  Ivanidze is of the opinion that "the anonymous message 
writers not so much blew up the political situation in the 
country as added distinctiveness to the aberration afflicting 
our society". 
  RABOSHAYA TRIBUNA runs a statement by Petr Romanov, member 
of 
the federation council. 
  "Under conditions when the present constitutional justices 
are virtually jobless and do not engage in judicial activities, 
they could, impelled by civic motives, participate in the quest 
for national concord in society, and advise executive and 
legislative power bodies, without a reward in addition to the 
state-provided salary which they receive for inaction", the 
statement said. 
  PRAVDA on non-application of amnesty to former Security 
Minister Viktor Barannikov. 
  The newspaper asserts that the office of the Russian 
Federation prosecutor-general did not apply the amnesty to 
former Security Minister Viktor Barannikov, who remains under 
investigation. His defence lawyer D. Shteinberg believes that 
this can hardly be explained by arguments that "the person 
staying in hospital has been forgotten in the struggle which A. 
Kazannik waged with the presidential entourage, seeking to 
release Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov and their 
associates as soon as possible." 
  The defence lawyer is convinced that Barannikov "has not 
been 
forgotten or pardoned." A certain role in this is played by the 
fact that the former minister "knows very much about Kremlin 
secrets."

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris </F>
Krivoshey] 
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Mar -- The situation surrounding the 
problem of the DPRK's participation in the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty (NPT) is prompting growing anxiety and 
alarm. Acting on the basis of its firm, consistent adherence to 
the NPT and its determination to prevent a center of tension -- 
especially nuclear -- emerging on its borders, Russia is in 
favor of a comprehensive settlement to the situation, says a 
Russian Foreign Ministry statement, with which Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of the Information and Press Department of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acquainted journalists at a 
briefing today. 
  Russia is prepared, the document observes, to support the 
resolution now under discussion in the UN Security Council 
appealing to the DPRK to meet its commitments to the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] under the NPT. 
  Taking account of the fact that the talks have not been 
crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to tackle 
the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose using a 
multilateral approach, which could be centered on an 
international conference attended by Russia, China, the United 
States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN 
secretary general and the IAEA director general, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry statement says. 
  We are certain, the Russian foreign policy department 
stresses, that only such an approach will enable us to find 
mutually acceptable, balanced solutions, which will ensure that 
the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and 
simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into 
confrontation. 
  The Russian Federation Foreign Affairs Ministry today issued 
a statement, which says: 
  "The situation surrounding the problem of the DPRK's 
participation in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] is 
prompting growing anxiety and alarm. Acting on the basis of its 
firm, consistent adherence to the NPT and its determination to 
prevent a center of tension -- especially nuclear -- emerging on 
its borders, Russia is in favor of a comprehensive settlement to 
the situation. 
  "First: We are prepared to support the resolution now under 
discussion in the UN Security Council appealing to the DPRK to 
meet its commitments to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] under the NPT. We will also seek decisive action by the 
Security Council in all other instances where threats of nuclear 
proliferation emerge, without double standards. 
  "Second: Taking account of the fact that the talks have not 
been crowned with success, we regard as inadequate attempts to 
tackle the problem within a bilateral framework. We propose 
using a multilateral approach, which could be centered on an 
international conference attended by Russia, China, the United 
States, Japan, the DPRK, the ROK, and representatives of the UN 
secretary general and the IAEA director general. This format 
for the conference is the most logical, because the 
aforementioned countries are located on the Korean Peninsula or 
in the immediate vicinity, and have a realistic ability to play 
a special part in a settlement. 
  "The agenda for the conference must make it possible to 
reach 
comprehensive solutions that take account of the legitimate 
interests of all the parties involved. In particular, subjects 
for discussion and agreement could be security guarantees for 
the DPRK and the ROK, assistance for the process of 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with international 
guarantees of its nonnuclear status, including appropriate 
international verification [kontrol], and guarantees of 
noninterference in the internal affairs of the DPRK and ROK. 
  "We are certain that only such an approach will enable us to 
find mutually acceptable, balanced solutions that will ensure 
that the nuclear nonproliferation regime is strengthened and 
simultaneously prevent the situation from slipping into 
confrontation."

  [Text] The situation in connection with the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] nuclear inspection in the 
DPRK was aggravated yet again this week. The United States 
insists that the DPRK opposes full control. In this connection, 
the regular round of the Korean-American talks was disrupted and 
it is not ruled out that the "Team Spirit" exercises might be 
resumed, which is causing great concern in North Korea. The 
DPRK Foreign Ministry made a statement in this connection which 
describes the United States' actions as perfidious. 
  I have spoken to the DPRK ambassador Son Sung-pil. I asked 
him what importance in this connection North Korea was attaching 
to the Soviet-Korean friendship treaty, since Russia was the 
legal successor to such treaties, and under this treaty our 
state was supposed to support the DPRK in the event of an armed 
conflict. The ambassador replied: 
  [Begin Son recording, in Korean fading into Russian 
translation] Russia is the legal successor to all international 
treaties, and therefore in this sense Russia also inherited this 
treaty. The only problem is how each side will fulfill its 
obligations under the treaty. 
  Since there is as yet no military conflict, it is difficult 
to predict, and one should not predict what Russia is going to 
do in this case. When concrete actions or circumstances have 
taken place then, perhaps, Russia will demonstrate its position 
on the treaty. We can only wish that the Russian Government 
should understand correctly the essence and truth of this 
nuclear problem and should not create any obstacles on the way 
of a fair solution to the problem, and, on the contrary, should 
assist in resolving the problem objectively and fairly. [end 
recording] 
  It seems to me that for the time being the Russian position 
with regard to this incident is very restrained.

  [Text] Moscow 24 Mar -- The issue of a possible reduction 
in the number of Russian troops on the South Kuril islands and 
their modernization has nothing to do with the problem of the 
peace treaty between Russia and Japan, Grigoriy Karasin, the 
director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and information 
department said at a briefing today. 
  He said that during talks at different levels between Russia 
and Japan, Japan had more than once posed the question of the 
withdrawal of Russian Armed Forces from the South Kuril islands. 
In answer to this we have always made it quite clear that the 
issue of the stationing of Russia's Armed Forces on Russian 
territory is our country's internal affair only and cannot be a 
subject for discussion at the talks with Japan, Karasin stressed.

Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and others from the 
"Diplomatic Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] An additional 100-strong Russian peacekeeping 
contingent will go to Sarajevo from Ryazan on 26 March, the 
Russian president's special envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference Thursday. 
  He said there would be Russian Orthodox and Muslim members 
in 
it, which reflected Russia's objective position. Russia rejects 
accusations of having a pro-Serb or any other position, he added. 
  He said that relations between the leaders of Croatia and 
the 
self-proclaimed Republic of Serb Krajina must be normalized. 
"There are ebbs and flows in relations between Zagreb and Knin, 
fraught with the danger of violence that may bury peaceful 
settlement in former Yugoslavia," he said. 
  He said that talks on a cease-fire were held in the Russian 
embassy in Zagreb on Tuesday. "The world community unanimously 
believes that cease-fire is the first thing to be achieved. 
Then economic relations must be normalized and then the 
political status of Croatia's Serb regions must be defined," 
said Churkin. 
  He pointed out that the talks in Zagreb were held in an 
absolutely new context. They involved representatives of the 
U.S., the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia, 
the EU, the UN and Russia. "Unfortunately, no agreement on a 
cease-fire was signed, and individual details are still to be 
specified. We hope, however, that during the next few days 
representatives of the UN and of the UN protection force in 
former Yugoslavia will take charge of this. We also hope that 
the talks will be continued in the Russian embassy in Zagreb on 
29 March," said Churkin. 
  He emphasized that the agreement between Zagreb and Knin was 
not simply a cease-fire agreement, but a complicated 
military-technical document envisaging the disengagement of the 
conflicting parties and a number of security measures. 
  Croat tourist companies have been actively inviting Russian 
tourists to visit Croatia lately, Churkin went on to say. 
"Before the Croats and Krajina Serbs reach a cease-fire 
agreement I would not recommend that Russian citizens spend 
their holidays in Croatia," he said.

  [Text] Moscow 25 March, TASS -- One hundred and twenty 
Russian paratroopers are flying from the military aerodrome 
"Dyagilova" (Ryazan) today to former Yugoslavia to reinforce the 
Russian battalion under the U.N. peacekeeping force command, the 
newspaper "SEGODNYA" (TODAY) writes. 
  Quoting Russian airborne troops commander Colonel-General 
Yevgeniy Podkolzin, the paper said that there are 1,200 Russian 
paratroopers in former Yugoslavia. A month ago from the Klis 
airport in Serb Krajina, where then 900 Russian paratroopers 
were stationed, 400 men were moved to Sarajevo, who, contrary to 
normal regulations marched some 500 km in 24 hours. 
  The Russian battalion in former Yugoslavia, popularly called 
"Rusbat," has been divided, Yevgeniy Podkolzin said. Now there 
are two Russian battalions in Yugoslavia. The first one, which 
left in Klis, is commanded by Colonel Sergey Voznesenski, and 
the second one in Sarajevo -- by Colonel Viktor Vorobyov. 
  The federal assembly has decided to despatch another 300 
paratroopers and an echelon with armoured vehicles. According 
to U.N. peacekeeping force regulations, any military equipment 
arriving at the places, where U.N. missions are being carried 
out, is paid for according to international prices. In the 
given case the United Nations will purchase armoured personnel 
carriers from Russia, the paper writes.

Sevryukov] 
  [Text] Moscow 24 March, TASS -- "No international efforts 
or mediators' trick will be able to lead to the settlement of 
the Yugoslav conflict unless the sides involved realise the need 
for resolving the conflict," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vitaliy Churkin said. 
  Speaking at a news briefing in Moscow on Thursday, Churkin 
expressed regret that the sides could not reach an agreement on 
cease-fire and the withdrawal of troops from the front line due 
to objective reasons. At the same time, he said that the 
meeting has confirmed the existence of an entirely new "format 
of mediatory activity." Russian, U.S., EU and UN mediators who 
took part in the talks acted jointly. This allowed them to 
influence the sides' behaviour in a constructive way and help 
the sides find common positions at the most critical stages of 
the negotiation process. 
  The Zagreb talks have confirmed the correctness of the 
chosen 
priorities in reaching a final settlement of the Yugoslav 
conflict. Mediators believe that ceasefire agreements are a top 
priority. The next step would be normalisation of economic ties 
between Croatia and "districts with the capital in Knin." This 
will create favourable conditions for determining the political 
status of these districts, he said. 
  Disagreements in relations between Zagreb and the "Serb 
capital in Knin" are fraught with a situation in which "any 
prospects of settlement in the former Yugoslavia will be 
buried," the diplomat said. He said the mediators will use the 
remaining time before the next round of talks scheduled for 29 
March to try to bring the warring sides to the realisation of 
the need to find constructive approaches, he said.

  [Text] Dushanbe 24 March, TASS -- CIS joint peacekeeping 
forces, with air and artillery units from Russia, Tajikistan and 
Uzbekistan attached to them, demonstrated high combat skills in 
well-coordinated actions within the framework of military 
exercises held in southern Tajikistan on Thursday. 
  Taking part in the manoeuvres were some 2,000 servicemen, 
backed by dozens of armoured vehicles and gun mounts, combat 
planes and helicopters of the latest models. The exercises were 
supervised by Russian Defence minister Pavel Grachev. Also 
present at the command post were Tajik Prime Minister 
Abdudzhalil Samadov, Tajik Defence Minister Aleksandr 
Shishlyannikov and Uzbek Defence Minister Rustam Akhmedov. 
  The manoeuvres simulated a situation at the Tajik-Afghan 
border, commander of peacekeeping troops in Tajikistan Boris 
Pyankov, who headed the exercises, told TASS. Their plot was as 
follows: A simulated enemy suddenly breaks through the CIS 
external border on the segment guarded by the Pyandzh border 
unit and tries to penetrate deep into Tajik territory, which 
makes CIS joint peacekeeping forces and units attached to them 
to enter a fierce battle. The simulated enemy is subjected to 
mass artillery shelling and air strikes, then motorized infantry 
units and tanks join the battle. The enemy is thrown back, and 
the state border is restored. 
  The manoeuvre commander and the Russian defence minister 
especially praised well-coordinated joint actions by the 
Russian, Tajik and Uzbek battalions. 
  After the manoeuvres, Grachev noted that the exercise site 
had been well organized from the engineering point of view. He 
also stressed that all troops participating in the manoeuvres 
had successfully coped with the task set before them. 
  According to the Russian defence minister, the main specific 
feature about this large-scale action was that it simulated a 
real situation. 
  All in all, CIS joint peacekeeping forces are scheduled to 
hold 12 military exercises this year.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Aleksandr Trushin] </F>
  [Text] Santiago, 24 Mar -- Retired General David Shoval, 
director of a directorate in Israel's Defense Ministry, is for 
close contacts between Israel and Russia in the 
military-industrial sphere. In an interview with ITAR-TASS on 
Wednesday [23 March], he said that there are good prospects for 
such cooperation, especially for joint modernization of old 
military equipment. 
  We should look for ways of cooperating in the 
military-industrial field. It would have been difficult to 
imagine this cooperation five years ago, but today it is quite 
possible. We made our first contacts at aerospace salons in 
Singapore and Paris and we should also use the [current] 
FIDAE-94 [expansion unknown] [exhibition]. We still do not know 
each other well. In the military-industrial sphere, we could 
start by exchanging information, David Shoval said. 
  All of Israel's state, private, and mixed enterprises 
producing arms and military equipment are subordinated to the 
directorate headed by Retired General D. Shoval, which controls 
all of Israel's military exports. 
  Retired General Shoval is in Santiago as one of the heads of 
the Israeli delegation at the international FIDAE-94 aerospace 
exhibition. On show from Israel's military industry are 
military trucks and service trucks, electronic arms, land, air 
and sea firing systems, and small arms weapons. According to 
the [retired] general, the most promising developments are in 
the field of infrared apparatus, [examples of which are] on show 
at the exhibition. 
  Currently, nearly 80 percent of Israel's military production 
is exported, some going to South America, said David Shoval. 
During the exhibition, a deal was struck with Chile for the 
delivery of service vehicles for the Carbineers Corps. At the 
same time, military budgets are being reduced in practically all 
countries of the world and Israel is no exception. As a result, 
some of our enterprises have started to modernize old equipment 
and weapons and are cooperating with a number of foreign firms 
in this. We could begin such cooperation with Russia, in 
particular, by renovating the close-range MIG-21 fighters. "You 
have high technology, while we could install modern electronic 
equipment in old planes. Currently, thousands of old MIG's are 
out of use. If we brighten them up, it could be a mutually 
profitable business," David Shoval said.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikita Yermakov] </F>
  [Text] Paris 24 March, TASS -- Russia's foreign policy 
passed several stages in the last two years, Vladimir Shumeyko, 
head of the Federation Council, the upper house of the new 
parliament, said. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Thursday, Shumeyko 
said that Russia had been forming its foreign policy since it 
had declared sovereignty in June 1990. The process was hampered 
by political complications within the country, which distracted 
attention from foreign policy. 
  But Russia has now approached the stage when it should build 
genuine democracy and a free civil society. The adoption of the 
Constitution and parliamentary elections have started the 
process of strengthening Russian statehood. Russia is a 
powerful, strong and sovereign state which remains open for 
cooperation, Shumeyko said. 
  Speaking about Russia's accession to the Council of Europe, 
Shumeyko noted that previously Russia asked for allowing it to 
join the council on special terms. But now the situation is 
different. "At the talks in Strasbourg with the Council of 
Europe leaders several days ago we did not ask for any 
exceptions for Russia. All admission procedures will be 
observed and the question of Russia's admittance to the Council 
of Europe will be included in the agenda by the end of the 
summer," he said. 
  Much will change in the Council of Europe after Russia joins 
it, Shumeyko continued. "Without our country it is impossible 
to solve European problems. It is impossible to do without 
taking into account Russia's opinion. This particularly 
concerns changes in Eastern Europe, including the states that 
have emerged in the former Soviet Union. There are laws by 
which empires emerge, but there are no laws by which they would 
disintegrate. Therefore, there are many problems to be 
discussed at the Council of Europe," Shumeyko said. 
  Asked about President Boris Yeltsin's health, Shumeyko 
replied that he is in good health, adding that some politicians 
are trying to destabilise the political situation in the country 
which has become more stable than a year ago. 
  Commenting on the results of the recent elections to local 
bodies of power in Russia, Shumeyko said that people did not 
show up at polling stations because they are tired of politics. 
However, he stressed that it is not the voters who are to be 
blamed but politicians who do not offer positive programmes.

  [Text] The Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev has 
spoken out against the surrender of Russian peace-keeping forces 
to the Ministry for Emergencies. At a Wednesday meeting with 
the press he said that everywhere peace-keepers are subordinate 
directly to the national Armed Forces. 
  He stressed that the new ministry does not have any combat 
weapons at its disposal. "Even when it carries out its missions 
it rents ships, aviation and armored vehicles from the Armed 
Forces and pays for their use", he said. 
  In Grachev's opinion the Ministry for Emergencies has no 
experience in commanding peace-keeping forces. He said that the 
purpose of the ministry is to resolve domestic problems: deal 
with the consequences of air crashes, accidents on railways or 
power stations etc. 
  "Peace-keeping tasks lie beyond the territory of the Russian 
Federation", he stressed. 
  At a news conference on March 17 the Minister for 
Emergencies 
Sergey Shoygu spoke in favor of subordinating the Russian 
peace-keeping force to his ministry. 
  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev expressed the opinion that 
the 
Federal Assembly will pass a law on the peace-keeping force 
after the April 20th. He told journalists that the status of 
units of the Russian Armed Forces performing peace-keeping 
functions has not been defined yet. 
  Answering a question from Interfax Grachev expressed the 
hope 
that the defense budget would be increased in 1994. He stressed 
that legislators are also responsible for the security of the 
state. According to Grachev, the budget proposed by the cabinet 
will not allow his ministry to continue reforming the Army. He 
said the money will not be enough to purchase the necessary 
weapons and machinery. 
  "With such a budget I will not be able to build strong Armed 
Forces," Pavel Grachev said.

<F P=106> [Report by diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and other from the "Diplomatic 
Panorama" feature] 
  [Text] Next summer's summit of the G-7 group in Naples will 
see another important step towards Russia's involvement in the 
activities of the G-7, notably in the political sphere, British 
ambassador to Russia Brian Fall said in response to an INTERFAX 
question. 
  He said that this decision could only be made jointly by all 
members of the group, and that he was fairly certain that this 
step would be taken. 
  He said, however, that the contribution Russia was making to 
the world economy was much below that of most advanced 
countries. He was confident, however, that once the dust 
settles and the reforms were complete, Russia would start 
getting rich. Its wealth was in its highly educated and skilled 
workforce. 
  Fall did not think that Western aid could solve all Russian 
problems. The West is sometimes criticized for helping Russia 
too little too late. There are reasons for that, however. 
Numerous entrepreneurs think that Russia is not predictable or 
stable enough and demand safety guarantees for their capital, he 
said. Russia has to create a more favorable environment for 
western private investments. He said that numerous Russian 
businessmen preferred to keep their capital in foreign banks. 
If Russian money flees Russia, why should the West invest in 
it, he asked. 
  Fall emphasized that the West continued to support President 
Boris Yeltsin, not as an individual but as the leader of Russian 
reforms. Meanwhile the West understood that Russia had come 
across numerous internal problems. This was probably the reason 
of the "painful reaction" to contacts between foreign political 
figures and the Russian opposition. British Premier John Major 
had recently visited the U.S. where he had meetings with 
representatives of various political movements. Nobody asked 
him why he had spent so much time with George Bush or Ross 
Perrot or accused him of pursuing a wrong line, Fall said. 
  He emphasized that a fully-fledged European security system 
was out of the question without Russia. He thought that the 
geostrategic environment was favorable for a system which 
sidelined neither Russia nor East European countries. A 
security system must be set up as soon and as broadly as 
possible.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valentin Pavlov] </F>
  [Text] Barnaul 24 March, TASS -- Several people were killed 
after a soldier opened fire in one of the Russian ICBM units in 
southwestern Siberia. 
  The accident occurred during a guard mounting ceremony when 
one of the soldiers armed with a sub-machine gun suddenly opened 
fire, killing his commander and several fellow soldiers. The 
guards on duty did not retaliate, fearing that bullets may hit 
fuel tanks of nuclear missiles deployed at the site. In that 
case a catastrophe would have been inevitable. 
  The local newspaper ALTAYSKAYA PRAVDA said that the guards 
are prohibited from firing in the direction of the missiles even 
in the event of an attack by a subversive group. 
  It took the commander of the unit three hours to persuade 
the 
soldier to surrender. During all this time the soldier, 
resident of Daghestan, did not leave a combat vehicle he had 
seized earlier. 
  The newspaper said that the "critical" accident that 
happened 
on March 10 was not reported to local counterintelligence 
officials, which explains why there was no order to send 
paratroopers to the site. 
  The newspaper did not speculate about possible motives of 
the 
accident.

  [Text] The chief Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman has 
expressed concern over progressive restrictions on the use of 
the Russian language in Moldova. 
  In a republic with an ethnic Russian population of more than 
half a million, "the diminishing number of Russian groups and 
classes in kindergartens and educational institutions is bound 
to cause concern in the Russian Federation," Grigory Karasin 
said at a news briefing in Moscow on Tuesday. 
  He said this state of affairs "is on conflict with the 
agreement on cooperation between the Ministry on the Affairs of 
Nationalities and Regional Policy of the Russian Federation and 
the State Department of Ethnic Relations of Moldova, signed in 
Kishinyov [Chisinau] in November 1993." 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry has been receiving "numerous 
appeals" from Russian-speaking citizens of Moldova and their 
organizations, "expressing deep anxiety about the possibility 
that, as a result of the forthcoming exams (in Moldova's 
official Romanian language to be held as of April 2 by decision 
of the government), non-ethnic Moldovans will be fired from 
their jobs on a mass scale merely because they have not yet 
mastered the Romanian language," Karasin said. 
  He said the Russian Foreign Ministry hoped that Moldova's 
leadership would take a "well-considered decision conforming to 
international standards of human rights and taking full account 
of the demographic, cultural and linguistic factors that have 
taken shape in the republic in the course of history."

  [Text] State Duma's CIS Affairs and Links with Fellow 
Countrymen and Economic Policy Committees held hearings on 
Russo-Belarusian relations Wednesday [23 March]. 
  German Kuznetsov, deputy minister of cooperation with CIS 
member states and head of the Russian delegation in talks on the 
merger of monetary systems, told MPs about the differences that 
the Russian and Belarusian officials had not managed to 
overcome, such as the rate at which the Belarusian cash should 
be exchanged for Russian money. 
  While the Russian experts insisted on using the same rate 
for 
exchange of cash and monetary assets and promissory notes, 
material and other assets, the Belarusian experts believed that 
the exchange rate had to recognize the actual buying abilities 
of the Belarusian and Russian rubles. 
  The two sided had not agreed on leveling the prices for 
deliveries of products between Russian and Belarusian businesses 
or on the merger of budgets. The Russian experts believed that 
the two countries had to adopt legislation in 1994 that would 
enable the merger of the budgetary systems in 1995, extension of 
Russian financial and budgetary legislation to Belarus and 
restriction of the ability of Belarusian authorities to make 
decisions on these issues because the would have to abide by the 
Russian legislation. 
  The Belarusian experts propose laying the groundwork in 1994 
for gradual consolidation of the budgets by adopting numerous 
legislative acts in this field. They also propose leaving out 
the formula that the two budgets should merge in 1995. 
  The main stumbling block is the status of the National Bank 
of Belarus. The Russian negotiators wanted the Bank to be 
reorganized no later than December 31, 1995 into a subsidiary of 
the Central Bank of Russia which would take over all its assets 
and liabilities and proposed extending to Belarus the Russian 
legislation on banks and banking activities and currency 
regulation and control. The Belarusian experts wanted the 
National Bank to retain the right to manage the merged monetary 
system within Belarus, without turning it into a subsidiary of 
the CBR [Central Bank of Russia]. 
  Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia Dmitriy Tulin 
thought that "the viability and stability of the monetary system 
being created" would not be assured unless the National Bank of 
Belarus became a subsidiary of the CBR. He emphasized that even 
though any kind of responsibility can be incorporated into the 
agreement, in real life "the extent to which treaties are 
observed in not impressive." 
  Tulin said before the process of merging the monetary 
systems 
of Russia and Belarus was complete, "the scope of the treaty 
could not be expanded." 
  Deputy Economy Minister Sergey Ignatyev emphasized that "the 
treaty cannot be essentially equal" and that "one currency must 
have one manager." The treaty should specify that Belarus 
sacrificed some of its sovereignty in the monetary and crediting 
sphere and had to comply with the demands made by the Russian 
authorities. 
  Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Georgiy Gaboniya said that his 
ministry supported the merger of the two monetary systems but 
believed that there were no guarantees that the agreements would 
be implemented as long as there was no political alliance. The 
merger should, he thought, culminate in "building a common fence 
against the rest of the world" such as common import and export 
duties, a common list of goods on which quotas would be imposed 
and common rules of trade with third countries."

<F P=106> [Interview with Petr Filippov, chief of the Russian </F>
President Administration Analytical Center for Socioeconomic 
Policy, by Vladimir Samoylov; place and date not given: "Do Not 
Count on Privileges But Speed Up Your Reforms..."] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Samoylov] What is your 
opinion on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian 
monetary systems? 
  [Filippov] In my analytical report, I wrote that the 
unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is 
inadmissible in the form it is currently being envisioned. 
  [Samoylov] The saddest thing is that, in Belarus, nobody, 
aside from a narrow circle of people, knows all details of the 
upcoming agreement, despite numerous reports. Discussions on 
this issue generally concern the very idea of unification and 
its intentions.... As everybody knows, however, the road to 
hell is paved with good intentions.... 
  [Filippov] We knew about all the shortcomings of this 
agreement. It would be an economic absurdity if banks that 
issue money united, and the Central Bank of Russia became the 
main bank, but their budgets and the bodies that draft them did 
not unite. 
  [Samoylov] What threat is associated with this? 
  [Filippov] Russia would lose several trillion rubles. 
Belarus would be threatened with upheavals connected with the 
fact that its macroeconomic indexes, such as the level of wages, 
are different. This would inevitably lead to tension. Certain 
Belarusian products would not be competitive on the Russian 
market. 
  [Samoylov] They are already uncompetitive. The government 
claims that this is due to expensive energy resources and high 
customs duties. 
  [Filippov] This could be resolved by signing a civilized 
agreement on free trade and customs union. If we abolish 
customs duties, internal and external prices will be equalized. 
  [Samoylov] Many Belarusians have the same opinion. We are 
being told, however, that there is no sense in arguing, since 
everything has already been arranged, and [Russian Prime 
Minister] Chernomyrdin will soon arrive to sign the documents.... 
  [Filippov] My opinion is one, Chernomyrdin's is another.... 
  [Samoylov] What is the opinion of [Russian President] 
Yeltsin? Can the president interfere once the agreement is 
already signed? 
  [Filippov] Yes, he can. He stated in his annual address 
that "any unifications and unions are possible, however, without 
damaging Russia." I will repeat: If the monetary systems are 
unified, this will become a millstone around Russia's neck. 
  [Samoylov] This is very likely to happen however. Certain 
doubts are raised here. For example, your miners are not paid 
for months, and entire regions are left without money. Is there 
a threat that Belarus will end up in the same situation 
following the unification of the two monetary systems? 
  [Filippov] The problem does not lie here. It does not 
require much effort to ceaselessly print "zaychiks" [Belarusian 
currency] -- as your government does -- to cover budget 
shortages, which triggers inflation and price hikes. 
  The Russian Government endeavors to prevent the unnecessary 
issuing of money. Sometimes this even leads to undesired 
results. for instance, Finance Minister Fedorov did not print 
additional money, and he did not pay peasants for grain ordered 
by the state. He did not pay the defense industry for tanks and 
missiles either. The defense industry was not able to pay the 
metallurgical branch, which was not able to pay miners. 
Nevertheless, the government can be blamed only partially for 
this. 
  The delays in payments are also connected with the fact that 
commercial structures do not pay one another either. They spent 
their money, for example, on privatization, or simply 
transferred the money abroad. The strike in Nadyma erupted when 
the oil industry refused to exchange their hard currency for 
rubles and pay construction workers. 
  Such phenomena are regulated by the law in the West. In 
Russia, as well as in Belarus, there is a gap in the law. 
  Our principle is that money should be earned, and we will 
stick to this. 
  [Samoylov] Many people here fear that the merger will be 
followed by a rapid influx of Russian shadow capital, which will 
"prikhvatize" [coined from the word "privatize" and the Russian 
word for "appropriate" -- "prikhvatit"] our economy 
immediately.... 
  [Filippov] Russia's current commercial structures have some 
$17 million in foreign bank accounts. Do you think that it is 
impossible to transfer at least part of this money to your 
republic right now, and eat Belarus up, lock, stock, and barrel? 
Even Switzerland can be eaten up. 
  [Samoylov] I think that Switzerland is beyond your capacity. 
It is a powerful state with clever laws.... 
  [Filippov] Capital flows to those countries which have 
better working conditions and legal guarantees. That is why it 
comes from Russia. I am convinced that its outflow from 
Belarus, rather than its influx to this country, will be even 
greater. 
  [Samoylov] It is this that is happening. By hook or by 
crook, all enterprises leave their profits in Russian or other 
banks. 
  [Filippov] This is natural. Nevertheless, our reform has 
gone much farther. Our inflation rate is lower. The key thing 
is that there is the hope in Russia that reform will be 
completed. While in your country.... It is enough to take the 
draft law on fixed prices alone.... 
  I suppose that the first country to fall into the abyss of 
the terrible economic crisis will be Ukraine. Belarus will 
follow suit, while Russia will pull out of the crisis.... 
  [Samoylov] What would you advise us in this situation? 
  [Filippov] Not to count on privileges that the merger of the 
currency systems is supposed to bring, but to speed up reform 
and implement a tough financial policy.

  [Excerpts] Russia and Belarus are moving toward monetary 
union. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] In Stanislaw Shushkevich's opinion: 
  [Shushkevich, interviewed at home] If monetary union is a 
payment for Russia agreeing to a customs union, I am for a union 
of this kind. If it is yet another game, and we have monetary 
union but there will be no customs union, I am categorically 
opposed to it. 
  [Correspondent] It is true that the political games behind 
this agreement are quite convoluted. It is interesting that 
Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich even agrees that the rumors of 
a political plot in Moscow may be connected with an attempt to 
disrupt the agreement on monetary union between the two 
countries. 
  [Kebich, interviewed standing in corridor] It could be, yes. 
Unfortunately I cannot exclude that. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Mecheslaw </F>
Hryb, by Uladzimir Hoytan, place and date not given: "Without a 
Real State Structure There Can Be No Real Power"] 
  [Excerpt] [Hoytan] What is being done today to prevent a 
further economic slump? 
  [Hryb] Unfortunately, so far, there have been no concrete 
changes for the better. To some extent, this is because we 
announced the formation of an economic union with Russia and a 
single ruble zone a long time ago. This somehow restrained 
people and prevented them from taking active measures to develop 
production. Enterprise, kolkhoz and sovkhoz managers, as well as 
ordinary people were waiting for the unification to occur. 
Special hopes were pinned to an exchange rate of 1:1. Many 
people thought: Why invest Belarusian payment bills in anything, 
when tomorrow I may receive valuable Russian rubles for them. 
Mutual payments between enterprises and even states were 
stopped, because everyone was thinking: When? I do not know 
who is to blame for prolonging unification; everybody acted in 
good faith. However, not everything depended on us -- there was 
the Russian side, too. There are advocates and opponents of 
this "marriage" both in our Republic and in Russia. The entire 
affair has been dragging on for too long. That is why we, the 
Supreme Soviet, had to discuss the issue of a credit-monetary 
system. The question was asked squarely: Until the issue of an 
economic union with Russia is finally resolved, payment bills 
should be granted the status of full-fledged money. We should 
decide and explain to the people what we do next -- form a 
unified monetary system or make our payment bill the only legal 
tender on our territory. 
  We are very concerned with other economic problems, too. In 
particular, these are our old ailments: A need to liquidate 
customs barriers and grant our products wider access to the 
Russian market, because our industries have always been oriented 
toward the latter. Without this, we will hardly resolve our 
other problems. 
  [Hoytan] Once there was a suggestion to unilaterally 
liquidate customs posts on the border with Russia. How do 
things look in reality? 
  [Hryb] Such declarations were voiced, all right. However, 
this has not led to anything. We do not have a customs union 
with Russia thus far. If we managed to liquidate customs posts, 
the cost of our products would be some 40 percent lower, 
regardless of the high prices for power resources. I believe 
that the issue of an economic union with Russia has not been 
removed from the agenda yet. However, this unification may last 
longer and be carried out step- by-step. 
  [Hoytan] What measures are envisioned for a structural 
reshaping of production? For instance, for a couple of years 
now we have been speaking about producing Belarusian cars. What 
for? Are we seriously planning to catch up with Japan, South 
Korea, the United States, Germany, and France in the motor 
industry? 
  [Hryb] In my opinion, priority should primarily be given to 
high-tech industries in which we have an appropriate material 
base and a qualified staff. However, it will take time to 
introduce these structural changes. In general, we do not aim 
to catch up with anybody. We should develop those industries in 
which we have certain experience and with which we can easily 
enter the world market. Nobody in the West would sell us 
designs yielding huge profits; most probably they will try to 
palm off today's or even yesterday's technologies. With regard 
to the conversion of our defense industries, we have a certain 
plan which will soon be discussed by the Supreme Soviet. 
  We are planning to form a nonstaff economic council 
subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. The council will 
be comprised of 25 leading economists. We are also going to 
form a nonstaff committee for legal issues made up of leading 
lawyers. The main authors of the Constitution will become 
members of the committee. 
  [Hoytan] A couple of weeks ago, the Russian Gazprom almost 
brought the Republic to her knees by announcing a dramatic 
reduction of gas shipments. What is being done to improve the 
situation and avoid these kinds of cataclysms in the future? 
  [Hryb] We have managed to resolve this issue. Besides, the 
Russian side brought the price down from $80 to $50 per cubic 
meter. A governmental delegation headed by Deputy Council of 
Ministers Chairman Stanislaw Bryl visited Moscow to discuss this 
issue. Moreover, we have reached an agreement to recalculate gas 
payments as of January 1994. 
  [Hoytan] Let us now address the topic which is more familiar 
to you, that of fighting crime. What measures does the Supreme 
Soviet and the government take to normalize the criminous 
situation? 
  [Hryb] The increase in crime is an acute problem in both 
Belarus and other CIS states, where the criminous situation is 
no better. While the disruption of the single economic space 
brought about most negative economic consequences, the 
disruption of the single legal space had an even more dramatic 
effect on the increase in crime. Besides, for a long time there 
were no state structures in the Republic; in fact state power 
was absent altogether. In other words, without a real state 
structure there can be no real power. 
  That was why the Supreme Soviet has recently directed all 
its 
efforts to adopt a constitution. The Constitution has been 
passed and it precisely distinguishes between legislative, 
executive, and judicial powers. Our Republic is going to be 
presidential. All this will add prestige to the executive power 
and will make it possible to step up the fight against crime and 
corruption. At the same time, we have drafted a special program 
on fighting organized crime. The program will have been 
discussed by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and the government by 
1 April. Incidentally, we have never had a similar program 
before. The issue of fighting crime is being treated at the 
state level for the first time ever. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy from the </F>
"Presidential Bulletin"] 
  [Text] During their talks in Minsk, the Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich and the Chairman of the Committee of the 
Russian Parliament's Upper House on Budget and Finances Nikolay 
Gonchar agreed to integrate their countries monetary systems on 
the principles laid down in a statement jointly issued by the 
Prime Ministers of Belarusia [Belarus] and Russia. 
  Belarusian Premier's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin told this 
to Interfax and said that the sides had decided to fix single 
fuel prices, exchange their currencies on a one to one basis, 
and recognize the National Bank of Belarusia as the chief bank 
of this sovereign state. 
  Each of the two countries will have a budget of its own; 
however, some joint programs, including those on military 
matters and efforts to eliminate the effects of the Chernobyl 
disaster, will be funded "from a joint treasury", Zametalin 
stressed. 
  He also noted that "unjustified delay regarding monetary 
integration accords has elevated this problem to a 
parliamentarian level." 
  Meanwhile speakers at the hearings on the problems and 
prospects of relations with Russia held in the parliament's 
lower house by the committees for CIS affairs, contacts with 
compatriots, and economic policy noted that Moscow and Minsk 
still differed on monetary integration. 
  For one thing, they have not agreed on what rate the 
Belarusian ruble be exchanged to the Russian ruble. Nor is 
there unanimity on levelling up the prices of Belarusian and 
Russian commodities and on combining budgets. 
  The basic difference, as was pointed out at the hearings, is 
that on the status of the Belarusian National Bank. The Russian 
side suggests that by 31 December 1994 the Belarusian National 
Bank be transformed into a branch of Russia's bank with the 
transfer of all assets and liabilities to it. It also proposes 
that Russian laws be applied to banking and currency exchange on 
the territory of Belarusia. However, Belarusian experts deem it 
necessary to retain the national bank's right to control a 
combined monetary system in Belarusia and disapprove efforts to 
subordinate the Belarusian bank to the bank of Russia. 
  The Vice-Chairman of Russia's Central Bank Dmitriy Tulin 
believes that "the monetary system now being created will lack 
vitality and stability, if Belarusia's bank does not become a 
branch of Russia's bank." He stressed that although in theory 
any degree of responsibility could be agreed, such agreement 
would hardly prove workable. 
  Tulin doubted that the number of participants in a new 
monetary union should be extended before Russia and Belarusia 
combine their monetary systems. 
  The Deputy Economics Minister Sergey Ignatiyev, for his 
part, 
emphasized that "a treaty cannot be equal in principle," and "a 
single currency must have one master." The document, in his 
view, should stipulate that the Belarusian side sacrifices part 
of its sovereignty on fiscal matters and has to give in to 
Russia's demands. 
  The Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister of Russia 
Georgiy Gabonya declared that his department favoured monetary 
integration; however, without political unity there is no 
sufficient guarantee that the accords will be implemented. A 
monetary integration accord, in his opinion, will lead to "the 
creation of a common fence to the rest of the world", which will 
necessitate single import-export duties and quotas, and single

  [Text] The presidential press service reported to INTERFAX 
that as before Moldova will give priority to friendly relations 
and cooperation with Romania and other neighboring states. 
Snegur declared this at a meeting with Romania's state 
secretary Florentin Popa, head of the army equipping department, 
and Romania's State adviser Ioan Roshka. 
  According to the presidential press service, the parties 
discussed a draft treaty on cooperation between the armed forces 
of the two countries and pointed to the significance of Romania 
and Moldova joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program. 
During the meeting Snegur received a letter from Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu in which the latter expresses hope that 
the relations between the two states will develop fruitfully and 
will assist in overcoming any difficulties related to the 
transfer to a market economy.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeli] </F>
  [Text] Chisinau 24 March, TASS -- The eighth round of 
Russian-Moldovan talks on the status and deadline for the 
withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova is due to get 
under way in Chisinau on 5 April, an official of the Russian 
Embassy in Moldova told TASS. 
  Moldova continues to press for unconditional pullout of 
Russian troops from the Republic by 1 July 1994. As for the 
Russian side, it links the withdrawal shcedule to Moldova's 
granting a special status to its breakaway Dniester region. 
Russia has recently stepped up considerably its activities 
aiming to settle the Dniester conflict. At the moment, the 
Russian president's special envoy Vladilen Vasev is staying in 
the region as a mediator between Moldovan authorities and the 
self-proclaimed Dniester Republic. The Russian diplomat has 
already met with moldovan President Mircea Snegur, parliament 
speaker Petru Lucinski and Dniester leader Igor Smirnov. He 
informed them about Russia's proposals, which could form the 
basis for resolving the protracted Dniester crisis. 
  Moldovan and Romanian newspapers are still exaggerating 
rumours that the 14th Russian army may be turned into a Russian 
military base in this region. The Moldovan head of state flatly 
dismissed the rumours. But other republican leaders and 
Russia's official representatives in Chisinau decline to give 
any comments. 
  The CSCE mission in Moldova has recently declared again for 
unqualified withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldovan territory 
and expressed grave concern over the lack of progress in 
settling the problems of the Republic's eastern regions.

  [Text] The Transdniestrian administration is getting ready 
to resume its dialogue with Official Kishenev [Chisinau] to 
determine the political status of the Dniester's Left Bank 
regions. A source in the Foreign Ministry of the 
self-proclaimed Transdniestrian republic reported to INTERFAX 
that "the proposals of the CSCE permanent mission in Moldova and 
proposals of the Russian Federation are to become the starting 
point for these negotiations." 
  According to the sources, the new stage of the negotiations 
may start in the near future, immediately after the new Moldovan 
parliament starts its work. This coincides with the proposals 
of the CSCE mission which pressed for resumption of negotiations 
after the parliamentary elections early this year. The source 
pointed out that at present an official envoy of the Russian 
president Vladlen Vasev takes the same position. The same source 
reported that in accordance with Russia's proposals "working 
groups will be formed at the new stage of negotiations, in 
addition, plenipotentiary representatives of Moldova's and 
Transdniestria's presidents will be appointed to coordinate the 
negotiating process along with President Yeltsin's envoy." The 
final decision on the time of the resumption of bilateral 
consultations to be held under the mediation of Russia and the 
CSCE mission is expected to be adopted this week after the 
conclusion of Vasev's visit to Kishenev and Tiraspol.

  [Text] Deputy head of Russian forces for nuclear, chemical 
and biological defences General Yuriy Tarasevich speaking in 
parliament put the country's stockpile of chemical weapons 
subject to destruction under an international convention at 
40,000 tons. These are deployed at seven different sites and 
must be destroyed within a period of ten years. 
  He said that chemical weapons causing a blistering effect 
were among the first to be destroyed at two sites-in the 
villages of Kamarka (Udmurtia) and Gorny (Saratov Region). 
Tarasevich said the operation would cost Rbl [rubles] 500 Bn 
[billion] at last year's prices. The total spending for the 
destruction of all chemical weapons runs at Rbl 2.5 Tn 
[trillion]. However, Tarasevich declined to say whether Russia 
was engaged in the development of new-generation chemical 
weapons on the grounds that this should be "the subject of a 
special session." 
  Head of the Foreign Ministry's arms control department Oleg 
Sokolov said it would be in Russia's interests to become one of 
the first of 65 signatories to ratify the convention on the 
destruction of chemical weapons. He said "negative implications 
from Russia's failure to do so are obvious." 
  For his part, chemical scientist Vil Mirzayanov who was also 
involved in the hearings told reporters that Russia had offered 
to destroy 40,000 tons of chemical weapons though it had 
produced more than 400,000 tons. In his view, the remainder was 
destroyed in a barbarous way without any elementary 
precautionary measures being taken, which in itself "is just as 
dangerous as the use of the weapon itself." To begin with, an 
international commission of experts must be set up to find where 
and how those weapons were buried, he said. Mirzayanov called 
for extending the destruction period from 25 to 30 years given 
the enormous spending involved.

  [Excerpt] Moscow March 24 TASS -- [passage omitted] 
ITAR-TASS was told by Major-General Yuriy Tarasevich, assistant 
commander of radiation, chemical and biological defence forces 
of the Russian Federation, who took part in the deliberations, 
that a concept has already been drawn up for scrapping combat 
toxic substances, but this required special financing. Shortage 
of money for the development of special technologies, 
construction of various installations and other jobs, envisaged 
by the complex programme, retards the implementation of the 
already adopted decisions. 
  General Tarasevich believes that this year will be decisive 
for preparations to begin the planned destruction of chemical 
weapons. He denied rumours and publications on the alleged 
"incineration of chemical shells". "All the ammunition is being 
reliably guarded and poses no threat to the environment," 
Tarasevich said. He believes they could remain stored for 
several more years. "It would be wrong to shift the difficult 
job of destroying them to the next generation. There is every 
opportunity to do it now, relying on international agreements," 
Tarasevich noted.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondents Gennadiy Kulagin </F>
and Vladimir Shekhovtsov] 
  [Text] Madrid, 24 March -- Kazakhstani President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, who is here on an official visit, held talks today 
with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. At a joint press 
conference after the meeting, both leaders stressed that it was 
constructive and frank and voiced the hope that the first 
official visit to Spain by the president of Kazakhstan and the 
documents signed in Madrid will promote the development of ties 
between the two states in a wide variety of spheres. 
  Replying to journalists' questions, Felipe Gonzalez noted 
the 
great potential for mutually beneficial cooperation with 
Kazakhstan in political, economic, cultural, and other spheres 
and also within the framework of international forums and 
organizations. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev spoke at the press conference about the 
economic reforms being implemented in the republic, the 
strengthening of democratic processes, and the activity of the 
CIS. Because of the forthcoming official visit by the president 
of Kazakhstan to Moscow, he had to answer many questions from 
journalists regarding present and future relations with Russia. 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev said that Kazakhstan has had common 
bonds with the Russian people for over 200 years. Our policy is 
aimed at ensuring the very best relations with our large 
northern neighbor. We have a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, 
and Mutual Assistance that is the basis of stable relations 
between two neighboring friendly states. 
  What is happening in Russia now, the president went on, is 
happening throughout the CIS. So it is the desire of the 
presidents of the countries of the Commonwealth for the 
transition from one condition to another and the reforms being 
implemented to be evolutionary and to prevent major interstate 
or other conflicts. The main thing now is to tackle the economy. 
Right from the start I have called for integration because I am 
well aware how a single economy functioned in the state that was 
the USSR, when some were suppliers of raw materials and others 
were consumers. This market remains the main market for us 
today. 
  The euphoria of the initial years after independence is 
already passing. However, I said back in 1991 that sovereignty 
alone would not fill stomachs. But everyone thought that they 
would start selling their goods to the West. However the 
Western market was already full and only we needed those goods. 
So, the president said, Kazakhstan drew up the plan for the 
economic union and it was adopted in September. Unfortunately, 
the different approaches of different states is so far 
preventing this plan from being implemented in practice. 
  If the economic union is to work, we will have to conclude a 
monetary union and a customs union and coordinate foreign 
economic policy at least on the export of raw materials, as well 
as create a common parliament to bring our legislation into 
line. In other words, we need to do what Western Europe has 
been doing for 30 years. Bearing in mind our considerable 
experience of living together, we could reach this more rapidly. 
  Like all of us, Russia is now experiencing a difficult time 
in its history. The hopes of Kazakhstan and the hopes of the 
West should be linked primarily with the continuation of the 
process of democratization and socioeconomic reforms. All 
Russia's neighbors will benefit from the continuation of this 
path. I am confident, the president of Kazakhstan concluded, 
that no one will succeed in turning back the common trend 
towards progress.

  [Text] [No dateline as received] Almaty -- Olzhas 
Suleymenov, the leading public and state figure and poet, 
decisively rejected accusations by a group of the radically 
minded writers who enjoy popularity with Kazakhs of ignoring 
national interests. In response to an address, which has been 
published by the local official press "to realize his special 
responsibility to the Kazakh nation and correct his mistaken 
opinion," he made a statement in the regular issue of the 
newspaper `People's Congress,' which is the voice of the 
People's Congress of Kazakhstan party. 
  The poet, the party leader, and the deputy of the Supreme 
Kenges says, in particular: I am experienced enough to 
understand that this publication of a writer's appeal in the 
official Kazakh newspapers has been fired against me and 
inspired by my permanent opponents, who as before prefer to 
remain in shadow. I used to believe, and I still believe, that 
national radicalism was and is the manifestation of political 
ignorance. Therefore, for several years I am trying to restrain 
the so-called patriots. 
  I and like-minded people in my party believe that "the 
course 
of history will lead us eventually to the creation of the 
confederation of Euroasian sovereign states, with the union 
between Russia and Kazakhstan being the nucleus of this 
economic-defense union. You write to me "we don't understand 
your suggestion. There is no nation in the world which doesn't 
strive to be independent. How can your speak about 
confederation, when our independence is only two to three years 
old?" 
  I want to explain this: confederation is the union of 
politically independent countries with their own presidents, 
governments, budgets, currencies, armies, parliaments, and 
constitutions. These countries are not subordinate to each 
other, they have a common economic and defense space, regulated 
by agreements which they sign. Borderlines between them are 
conventional. The states create the most-favored nation regime 
in trade and economy for each other. 
  President Nazarbayev has been working for this all these 
years -- he simply doesn't use the word "confederation." 
Presumably this is because of his attitude to political terms. 
  Further on, Olzhas Suleymenov went on to note that those who 
have made accusations do not know history. "You are saying that 
up until recently Russia acted as an empire while Kazakhstan was 
a colony." These definitions might have been correct before 
1917. Later on, both Russia and Kazakhstan became dependent on 
the bureacratic center. 
  I studied issues of colonialism and national-liberation 
movements over a period of thirty years. I travelled to Asiatic 
and African countries, former British, Portuguese, and French 
colonies. Can you imagine unskilled Englishman working, for 
example, in India and any Indian supervising his work? Or can 
you imagine Frenchman cultivating land in Africa, with his boss 
being from Senegal? Who is the slave and who is the colonizer? 
  Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan are difficult, says 
Olzhas Suleymenov. Therefore, now when Kazakhstan is facing a 
dilemma we have to be honest and objective in remembering the 
main landmarks of our history. These are: in the 18th century 
it was Russia who saved Kazakhstan from extermination; in the 
19th century Kazakhstan became Russia's colony; in the 20th 
century we together with the Russian people fought and won. It 
was the Russian Federation who has given us our independence. 
This must be remembered. Independence. 
  The conclusion is: Kazakhstan can live without the Russian 
empire and Russia can develop successfully without Kazakhstan as 
its colony, but in the very near future they wouldn't be able to 
exist without each other as equal and sovereign states, since 
their histories are so interconnected. The current economic and 
other problems of the two countries is the proof of this. 
  "There is no future for our country if we won't understand 
this," summarises Suleymenov. "Kazakhstan and Russia have been 
united by our wise ancestors, let's not allow ignorance to 
divide us."

  [Text] Dushanbe, 25 March (TASS) -- One of prominent field 
commanders of the Tajik armed opposition has been detained by 
Tajikistan security personnel in the Panj border district, a 
spokesman in the republican Security Ministry told ITAR-TASS on 
Friday. 
  The spokesman declined to give the name of the detained, 
pleading "the investigation interests and the safety of his 
family." 
  The first testimony given by the detainee are undoubtedly of 
interest and concern the whereabouts of an armed opposition 
group on the Afghan bank of the Panj River and its immediate 
plans in the efforts to destabilise the situation in that sector 
of the Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] Tajik Security Minister Saydamir Zukhurov said in an 
interview with INTERFAX Thursday that the Tajik Armed Forces 
were capable of defending the Republic's independence and its 
people. 
  According to Zukhurov, the domestic opposition in Tajikistan 
represents no serious threat to the state. He pointed out that 
the opposition consisted of separate bandit formations in the 
mountain regions. He stressed that these opposition formations 
were only capable of committing terrorist acts and sabotage in 
distant populated centers. 
  Zukhurov supported the idea of political settlement in the 
Republic. He announced that negotiations between the official 
authorities and the opposition were being prepared. 
  Zukhurov also spoke for the further presence of CIS joint 
peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan. He said the peacekeeping 
forces must remain in the region until a final settlement of the 
situation in the Republic.

<F P=106> [Third and last installment of an interview with 'Abdollah </F>
Nuri, a leader of Tajikistan's Islamic Movement Party, with an 
unidentified JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the West's 
stances on and the role of Russia in Tajikistan's civil war? 
  [Nuri] Tajikistan's problem is not an ethnic, regional, or 
national one. It is not related to Tajikistan alone; it is a 
world problem. In other words, the war in Tajikistan does not 
involve only the Kulabs and the Khojands. The center of this 
war was all the Eastern and Western powers. When the first 
gathering was held [not further specified], more than 70 world 
correspondents came to Tajikistan and talked with them. They 
told all the Islamists that despite communist pressures they had 
preserved their religion and that if the expansion of Islam is 
not prevented in Tajikistan, the victory of the Muslims would be 
definite. Therefore, this was a plot that was hatched by the 
superpowers of the world. This was a plot that was engineered 
by the Zionists, executed by the United States, and implemented 
by Russia. Islam Karimov told the British that if Russia and 
Uzbekistan did not interfere in the Tajikistan war, an Islamic 
rule would be established. In other words, he proudly said: 
Since I, too, am someone who opposes Islamic regimes in the 
region, I am striving to annihilate Islamic fundamentalism. 
Thus, the Tajikistan problem is a world problem and the 
superpowers do not want an Islamic rule to be established. I 
have repeatedly said that Tajikistan is the door to Islam and 
the base of infidels. If the door to Islam is opened all the 
area that was formerly Muslim will turn to Islam and it will 
spread to all countries, but the infidels do not want this door 
to be opened. Thus, they have formed a barricade here from 
which they can attack regional areas; namely Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, and Iran, as well as other countries. 
  The extremely weak economic situation in Tajikistan has made 
the communist leaders sell the country's independence. 
Abdullodzhanov, chairman of the Council of Ministers, said that 
we even want to adhere to Russia. Some 70 percent of 
Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia. That country wants 
to take this area to revive the former Soviet Union. Also, 
there is a threat against the United States here because some 
days ago Russia signed a military pact with Kuwait for the sale 
of arms and thus paved the way for its presence there. The 
creation of a small Russia in northern Afghanistan is not only a 
threat to the people in this country but to the West as well. 
The United States thinks that Russia is under its control 
today. But Russia is doing what it wants, such as selling arms 
to other countries. By taking Tajikistan, Russia wants to 
continue its plans and gain access to warm water ports, either 
through Afghanistan or Tajikistan. In this case, the world will 
be placed under Russia's control. What Russia is now doing is 
against U.S. policies as well. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] In view of the fact that the peace talks 
have reached an impasse, what plans does the Islamic Movement 
have? Does it consider talks with Russia and with the Tajik 
Government to be in its best interest? 
  [Nuri] The Islamic Movement and all its officials will not 
refrain from any type of talks. In other words, they want 
talks. But these talks should not be a political game. They 
should be genuine talks that will benefit the nation. The 
Islamic Movement wants to hold talks with Russia. Before 
talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan, we want to 
hold talks with Russia because it has been the cause of many 
adversities in our country and the entire world knows that 70 
percent of Tajikistan's budget is supplied by Russia. 
Therefore, talking with the communist leaders of Tajikistan is 
meaningless. We have held more than 16 rounds of talks during 
the civil war since we knew that this war was not in the 
interest of the nation and it would not benefit either Islam or 
the people. We tried our best to make the people understand the 
truth. But it was obvious that several power-hungry people were 
bent on destroying everything. The person who was responsible 
for the failure of the talks was Rakhmanov, who is the leader of 
Tajikistan today. When parliament was formed in Khodzhand, 
Rakhmanov tried to sweet-talk the people and called for peace. 
He gathered all the commanders together and made peace among 
them. We decided to end the bloodshed and to let peace be 
established. We had a plan that Rakhmanov did not accept. 
  The mujahidin commanders had told Rakhmanov that if he came 
to Dushanbe he would be welcomed with flowers, but he preferred 
to come with bloodshed. With his arrival in Dushanbe, murder 
and plunder started. House searches began and people were 
massacred. This happened because these people do not do their 
own thinking. Everything depends on Russia. This is why we want 
to hold talks with Russia so that we can understand its leaders' 
thoughts and stances and so that they will understand us, too. 
  We fully believe in divine promise. We are fully confident 
of the spirit of the mujahidin. Even if this war continues for 
years, we will win. The communists are condemned to defeat by 
the mujahidin because the communists have never been on the 
front lines of the war. They bring the Muslims and the children 
of Muslims to fight. It does not make any difference to them. 
We have been told that the Jews are teaching their women and 
children English so that they will be ready when the time comes 
to flee and go to America or other places. Their children are 
not sent to war so that they will not be killed. It is the 
children of the people of Tajikistan--90 percent of the Tajiks 
are Muslim--who go to war. There may be communist forces in 
some places, but it is mainly the children of the Muslims who 
are involved in the war. This is a world plot based on letting 
Muslims be killed by Muslims. Nevertheless, we believe that we 
can hold talks and solve problems through political means. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What percent of the Tajik people are in 
the Islamic Movement and what role do Tajikistan's national and 
democratic forces play in the movement? 
  [Nuri] When the Islamic Movement was an official party known 
as the "Islamic Movement Party," it had its special members and 
cadres. But when we emigrated, this movement became a general 
movement of Tajikistan. In 1975 the Islamic Movement adopted an 
organizational form, while before that there were dispersed 
movements. When communist rule came to Tajikistan, the elders 
and the 'ulema continued this movement clandestinely. 
  In 1975, we gathered all the people's views into one place 
and prepared them for a struggle and for the expansion of Islam 
and of Islamic rights. Today, we can say that all the Muslims 
who are living for Islam at home or abroad are members of the 
movement. 
  The role of the national and democratic forces in the 
Islamic 
Movement, and especially in northern Afghanistan, is very good. 
In other words, the democratic and national forces and all the 
expert forces who were employed in communist establishments and 
factories are all under the umbrella of the Islamic Movement 
today and are working with us. They also shoulder important 
responsibilities in the movement. They believe that in 
Tajikistan only Islam can solve the political, economic, and 
social problems of the people and that no other group or 
organization can do anything. Other organizations also support 
us. Through many efforts and struggles by the Islamic Movement 
in Afghanistan, which has given all it could, we have been able 
to establish a coordination center in Moscow. In short, I 
should say that in our current struggles all the ethnic groups, 
parties, and organizations support us. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion of the human 
rights groups and their lack of support for the just demands of 
the Islamic Movement of Tajikistan and of the Muslims? 
  [Nuri] The behavior of human rights organizations toward us 
is surprising. There is a UN High Commission, which should help 
refugees and should not be dependent on any world policy. It 
should not differentiate among refugees, whether they are 
Tajiks, Uzbeks, communists, or Muslims. The UN Charter states 
that a calamity-stricken refugee should receive unconditional 
support. 
  But, unfortunately there are 40,000 refugees in Tanduz 
[place 
name as received]. Only 8,000 of them were assisted by the 
United Nations. This assistance was stopped later on. For 
example, there are refugees in Mazar-e Sharif who are under 
Dostam's control. They have been assisted. But the refugees in 
Emam Saheb and Tash Kurgan [place name as received], who were 
helped up to a point, were taken to Bandar-e Shirkhan on the 
Tajik-Afghan border to make them return to Tajikistan. They 
were told that anyone who wanted assistance should go to 
Bandar-e Shirkhan. Some refugees went there and were placed 
under UN control. They then encouraged them to return to 
Tajikistan, but without promising them security. You, too, 
heard that many people who were repatriated were executed. The 
Medecins Sans Frontieres Organization announced that Muslim 
Tajiks in Tuz who did not give in to communism were massacred. 
They were the ones who reported on the dire and restless 
situation in the area. But they are still encouraging the 
people to return. We cannot say that it is the UN employees who 
are to blame because others are also not pursuing UN laws, but 
there are between 40,000 and 41,000 refugees in Tanduz who are 
not receiving any assistance. 
  It is as though this organization does not officially 
recognize the refugees. Among their rights, which are not 
recognized, are education, health, and the protection of 
children. In their opinion, a needy person is someone who is 
not a Muslim and someone who professes Islam is not a human 
being. If a girl shoots at Husni Mubarak, the United Nations 
and the correspondents of the world will report on this 
extensively. But when children, women, and men are killed in 
wars and when young and old die of malaria or of other diseases, 
no one says anything. We have sent a letter to the UN offices 
in Mazar-e Sharif and in Pakistan and to Mr. Butrus-Ghali 
calling for humanitarian assistance for the refugees, but we 
have not received any reply yet. 
  With the help of UN personnel, the water of a reservoir in 
Mazar-e Sharif, which was used by refugees, was poisoned and in 
one day 32 children and 200 others died. Everyone knew about 
this, but nothing was done. Only the head of the refugees there 
was deceived. Thus, the behavior of human rights organizations 
toward the Tajik refugees has not been good until now. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What are you asking from regional 
Islamic 
countries? 
  [Nuri] As I have stated, the Tajikistan problem is not a 
problem in our country alone. It is a problem that is linked to 
all the Muslim countries. We should not ignore this. For 
example, it has been a year since Tajiks began living under dire 
conditions in Tajikistan and northern Afghanistan. There are 
about 100,000 refugees in Afghanistan, some of whom do not have 
shelter. These refugees have not been officially recognized by 
the Afghan Government until now, and politically they are not 
even considered full refugees. No Islamic country in the world 
has recognized them as refugees. No reports are heard on radio 
and television on these people and their problems. Let them not 
help because we know that the world is under pressure by the 
superpowers. Also, the Islamic countries too are being 
pressured by superpowers. They cannot overtly help the jihad in 
Tajikistan today.

  [Text] Moscow March 24 TASS -- Ingush President Ruslan 
Aushev called upon the residents of the republic to remain calm 
and restraint. The appeal followed a series of recent incidents 
which have increased tension in the zone of the state of 
emergency, the press service of the Ingush embassy in Moscow 
said on Thursday. 
  The press service said that in one such incident a Russian 
Interior Ministry senior officer, identified only as Colonel 
Sibirtsev, received heavy bodily injuries after the convoy of 
trucks he was accompanying was attacked by residents of the 
village of Chermen in the Prigorod district. They used sticks, 
rods and stones to attack the trucks which carried Ingush 
refugees. As a result, seven people, including women and 
children, received injuries of various degrees [no punctuation 
as received] 
  The press service also cited cases of mortar shelling of 
Ingush homes in Chermen on Wednesday [23 March] and last night. 
No casualties were reported. 
  "These planned and directed provocations aim at pushing the 
Ingush people for a new bloodshed," Aushev said.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz March 24 TASS -- At its session today, 
the North Ossetian republican parliament paid attention to the 
extension of the state of emergency on part of the republic's 
territory. Due to the prolonged tense situation along its 
border with Ingushetia and incessant attacks on factories, 
plants, military units and police posts by armed bandit gangs, 
the parliament resolved to request the president of the Russian 
Federation and the Federal Assembly to extend the emergency 
situation in the Mozdo, Pravoberezhnoy and Prigorodnoy districts 
and part of the settlements near the city of Vladikavkaz. 
  Addressing the session, North Ossetian President Akhsarbek 
Galazov, said that in particular, Russia has already spent over 
100 billion roubles to support the emergency situation. But the 
situation in the zone of conflict is complicated, there are 
conditions which lead to its further aggravation, the refugee 
and hostage problems remain unresolved and the local population 
in the region possesses a lot of arms. Currently Russian 
peacekeeping forces are the guarantor of security in the zone of 
conflict. 
  Akhsarbek Galazov reaffirmed his initiative to hold a 
meeting 
with Ingusetian President Ruslan Aushev aimed at discussing a 
settlement between their two republics. But this meeting must 
be well-prepared, he emphasised.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Drawing the Lines" </F>
rubric: "Regions Demand Division of Powers"] 
  [Text] In Tambov, representatives of the regional 
associations "Black Earth Region," "Siberian Accord," "Central 
Region," "Northwest," "Northern Caucasus," and "The Urals" 
signed yesterday a general agreement, compiled by themselves, 
between the government and the above regional groups. 
  The document in the form of yet another petition is expected 
to reach Viktor Chernomyrdin's desk soon. Should the Russian 
premier add his signature to it, the regions would finally 
secure a clear delimitation of powers of the Federation 
components and the Federal government in the budget, taxation, 
and foreign policy spheres. 
  The conference participants announced that the agreement 
would replace the separate treaties each Federation component 
has with the center. Sergey Shakhray, who attended the 
conference and who is regarded, according to some information, 
as the mastermind of the agreement, stated that the ideal option 
would be for the oblast and local budgets to absorb up to 75 
percent of the public revenues. 
  A draft agreement lobby was created in the form of a 
coordination council which will "have its representatives in the 
central organs of power and directly transfer to the regions the 
powers they are going to procure." It is known from recent 
history, however, that it is not going to be easy for the 
regions to get the powers -- even despite the fact that Sergey 
Shakhray is prepared to sacrifice for the agreement the 
government careers of four ministers, members of the Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord.

  [Text] Moscow March 23 TASS -- Kalmykian President Kirsan 
Ilyumzhinov's decision to abrogate the republic's constitution 
and to recognise that only Russia's Constitution operates in the 
republic's territory is undemocratical and is far from 
consolidating the federation, believes Leonid Smirnyagin, member 
of the Presidential Council. 
  Smirnyagin, a permanent expert on regional policies, told 
ITAR-TASS that under the Russian Constitution subjects of the 
federation have no right to alter a region's status 
unilaterally. Moreover, such acts by republics' politicians 
destroy the federation. 
  If such a step were taken, this would mean violation of the 
principles of state structure of Russian Federaion, Smirnyagin 
said. He said he is amazed at Ilyumzhinov's intention to 
implement his idea without discussing it with Kalmykia's 
population and without holding a referendum. 
  Commenting on possible political motives of the Kalmykian 
leader, the member of the Presidential Council recalled 
Ilyumzhinov's unsavoury role in the autumn in last year when he 
virtually backed those who unleashed bloody events in Moscow. 
"Probably the Kalmykian leader by his awkward initiative now 
tries to please Moscow and get absolved of his sin," Smirnyagin 
notes.

<F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Yegor Trubnikov: </F>
"Zhirinovskiy Did Not Come, But Rally Was Held"] 
  [Text] A rally was held on Sunday at Vladivostok's central 
square under the traditional banner "In Defense of Human 
Rights," with (by approximate count) about 1,000 persons 
participating. 
  The information that in connection with certain political 
events Vladimir Volfovich himself was planning to be in 
Vladivostok and take part in the rally came early Sunday morning 
from the Russian radio, which could not fail to increase city 
residents' interest in the planned event. It would be unfair to 
say, however, that people came ONLY to see Zhirinovskiy--those 
who gathered here were sincere, convinced supporters of Viktor 
Cherepkov and the former masters of the Vladivostok mayoralty. 
  The absence of the promised LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party 
of 
Russia] leader at the rally did not disappoint those present: 
The famous extravagant and original thinking of the latter was 
more than compensated for by the speakers, whose expressions far 
from always could be defined as parliamentary language. Which in 
turn may prompt another series of court hearings on cases "in 
defense of honor and dignity" of a number of high-ranking 
persons in the kray administration. After two hours of debates, 
a resolution was adopted, expressing the resolve to continue 
fighting for human rights in Vladivostok. 
  The rally ended without incidents.

illegal, is calling for their expulsion.

<F P=106> [Valeriy Orlov report under the "Conflict" rubric: </F>
"Maritime Syndrome in Nizhniy Novgorod"] 
  [Text] Nizhniy Novgorod -- Conflicts are currently in 
vogue. The slanging match between the two administrations in 
Vladivostok has not yet died down, and now here is another one 
-- between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and city 
administration head Dmitriy Bednyakov. To try to extinguish the 
smoldering flame before it takes hold was the aim of a one-day 
visit to the Volga city by Petr Filippov, chief of the 
Presidential Administration Administration for Information 
Support. 
  "I have come to study the situation on the ground on the eve 
of the elections," he told ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent. 
"You see, the Presidential Administration is concerned that in 
a number of oblasts and regions elections have been 
unsuccessful. Nor are we unaware of the preelection conflict 
between Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov and Mayor 
Dmitriy Bednyakov..." 
  In order to get to the bottom of the situation, Petr 
Filippov 
visited the city administration, talked with the governor, met 
local entrepreneurs, exchanged opinions with citizens, and spoke 
with journalists. I inquired as to his impressions. They are 
on the whole positive. Concerning the elections for the oblast 
legislative assembly, the city duma, and the mayor of Nizhniy 
Novgorod due on 27 March Petr Filippov expressed himself 
optimistically. In his opinion they will be successful, and he 
foresees a fairly high percentage turnout. 
  [Orlov] "Why?" 
  [Filippov] "Conflicts always attract attention and intrigue 
people...." 
  What is the essence of the preelection clashes in Nizhniy 
Novgorod? Initially they centered around the privatization of 
the motor car plant. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written about this 
several times. Then the adoption of the Nizhniy Novgorod 
charter became the bone of contention. Dmitriy Bednyakov, the 
current acting mayor, decreed that a referendum should be held 
27 March on the local self-government charter. But Governor 
Boris Nemtsov, relying on the law and an interpretation from the 
Russian Federation president's state-legal administration, 
deemed the city mayor's actions a contravention of legislation 
and revoked his referendum decree. Bednyakov, in turn, does not 
agree with Nemtsov's conclusions. And so on and so forth. 
  P. Filippov did not give his assessment at the press 
conference of the preelection squabbles in the upper echelons of 
power in Nizhniy Novgorod. This circumspection can only be 
welcomed. The situation will be reported to the president 
personally, he said. At the same time the visitor from Moscow 
expressed regret over the marked split in the ranks of local 
reformers.

  [Text] According to preliminary reports, the elections to 
the St. Petersburg Assembly have been recognized as valid in 25 
out of 50 St. Petersburg constituencies. All of these 
constituencies will hold a second round of the elections, since 
none of the candidates canvassed the required number of votes. 
  Among 50 candidates, there are 20 representatives of the 
bloc 
St. Petersburg Democratic Unity, which support Russia's Choice. 
The bloc is headed by the former chairman of Petrosoviet, 
deputy of the Federation Council, Aleksandr Belyayev. 
  St. Petersburg Democratic Unity is followed by another bloc 
called All St. Petersburg which claims to encompass the city's 
bankers, businessmen and intellectuals and is headed by a deputy 
chairman of Goskomimuschestvo (committee for managing state 
property), Sergey Belyayev. The third place is occupied by a 
centrist bloc, The City We Love, headed by Vice Mayor Vyacheslav 
Scherbakov. 
  The bloc Business St. Petersburg formed by directors of 
state-owned enterprises nominated the former head of the Baltic 
steamship line who is now accused of forgery and embezzlement of 
state property and remains under investigation. 
  None of the candidates nominated by Communist, nationalist, 
patriotic and liberal democratic parties managed to enter the 
second round of the elections. 
  After another nomination of candidates, the other 25 
constituencies will hold the first round of the elections once 
again. On March 20-21, the proportion of those who voted in the 
city reached a mere 25.6 percent. Some experts and observers 
are skeptical about the procedure for the vote count, since St. 
Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak lifted the restriction barring 
soldiers and students from voting on the election day in 
accordance with a court decision. Therefore, these categories 
of electors were not included in the main election lists 
beforehand. Instead, they were introduced into additional lists 
as they showed up at the ballot stations. If they had been 
included in the main lists beforehand, the percentage of voters 
could have been even lower and would never have reached the 
25-percent mark required to make the elections valid.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Ivanov report from St. Petersburg under the </F>
"Money" rubric: "St. Petersburg's Budget Approved Without City 
Assembly. City Treasury's Expenditures To Exceed Revenues for 
the First Time"] 
  [Text] The St. Petersburg government has hastily approved 
the city's budget for 1994. It is planned that the city 
budget's annual revenues will be 2,116,772,000,000 rubles [R] 
and expenditures will amount to R3,607,993,000,000 in 1 February 
1994 prices. Hence, city hall has envisioned for 1994 a budget 
deficit of nearly R1.5 trillion. 
  It is expected that social spending will account for 40 
percent of budget expenditures, nearly the same share as the 
maintenance of the municipal infrastructure. The maintenance of 
government authorities will require 1.5 percent of the entire 
budget expenditures. Another 14 percent of St. Petersburg's 
budget appropriations will be channeled to finance investment 
projects. The share of expenditures on the municipal 
infrastructure will rise 1.5 percent, that of social and 
cultural spending will be up 0.5 percent. According to city 
hall, the maintenance of government authorities will be less 
costly for the city's taxpayers -- specialists from the 
financial committee managed to reduce the share of expenditures 
on the maintenance of bureaucrats by 0.1 percent. 
  According to assessments by city hall's financial committee 
specialists, implementing the budget approved by the city 
government will be a hard task. By comparison with other 
Russian Federation components, St. Petersburg's overly 
cumbersome economy, prone to inertia, is impeding the city's 
transfer to new principles of budget formation, but city hall 
expects to cope with the problem.

<F P=106> [Boris Toumanov report on interview with Armenian Foreign </F>
Minister Papazyan in Brussels; date not given: "Mr. Papazyan 
Pessimistic About Karabakh"] 
  [Text] Visiting Belgium this week to meet with officials 
from the European structures, Foreign Minister Papazyan of 
Armenia -- a former Soviet republic -- said Wednesday to LA 
LIBRE BELGIQUE that his country could quite soon join the 
Partnership for Peace program put forward by NATO. "In this 
connection I felt that the talk I had in Brussels with NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner was very useful. His 
conceptual clarifications convinced me that it would be 
appropriate for us to cooperate with the Atlantic Alliance," he 
indicated. According to the Armenian minister, a NATO expert 
group will visit Armenia shortly to study the details of his 
country's possible membership in the Partnership for Peace 
program. The Armenian foreign minister, who feels that, 
generally speaking, the initiative is positive, would 
nevertheless like it to lead to the creation of precise 
mechanisms capable of ensuring stability in the CSCE's 
geopolitical area of responsibility, including of course the 
area of the former USSR. 
  Mr. Papazyan said that Armenia's position on this issue was 
quite close to Russia's. He also said that he has recently been 
holding a permanent dialogue with his Russian counterpart, Mr. 
Kozyrev, so that they can "coordinate" their respective 
positions on this matter. According to the Armenian minister, 
Armenia feels that the question of concrete security mechanisms 
within the framework of the CSCE is crucially important in so 
far as the efforts of the "Minsk Group" to resolve the problem 
of Karabakh have so far failed to bear fruit, precisely because 
of the absence of an instrument likely to achieve these efforts 
on the ground. 
  The Armenian foreign minister, who deplored the 
international 
community's detachment from the problems in the trans-Caucasus 
region, noted that the Russian Army represented the only 
potential guarantor of stability in that region, in so far as 
the West is clearly not prepared to send its intervention forces 
into the trans- Caucasus. At the same time he also made it 
clearly understood that the presence of international observers 
in this region would be essential to ensure not only stability 
but also to supervise Russian troops activity. 
  Speaking about the situation in Karabakh, Mr. Papazyan said 
that the negotiations currently continuing in Moscow between the 
representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Karabakh -- with the 
mediation of Russia and the CSCE -- have encouraged the truce 
that has recently emerged in the field. Nevertheless, he said 
he was rather pessimistic as to the possibility of seeing these 
negotiations lead to a feasible political solution to the 
conflict, "because it is highly probable that Azerbaijan once 
again views them [the negotiations] as an opportunity to regroup 
its forces in order to relaunch the offensive against the 
Armenians in Karabakh." According to Mr. Papazyan, "this war has 
already gone too far." The Armenian minister thinks that this 
tragic evolution of the conflict, which he feels, by the way, to 
be strictly Azerbaijan's internal problem, is primarily due to 
the fact that the Azeri leaders have never truly renounced their 
attempts to resolve the problem by military means. However, 
according to the Armenian foreign minister, any persistence by 
Baku in this direction is likely to force Armenia to intervene 
"for good" in this conflict, which risks taking on an especially 
dangerous international dimension.

  [Text] The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service reports 
that calm prevails on the borders. Let me remind those who 
missed our previous newscasts that the Azerbaijani Army shelled 
Armenia's northeast border last night. Fire was opened on the 
defensive positions around Berdavan in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon. 
There are wounded. Our border guards did not retaliate. 
  Active military operations are continuing in the southeast 
of 
the Karabakh war front. Fierce battles continued in the 
direction of Fizuli yesterday for the control of hills 
overlooking Alkhanly. The Karabakh military units maintained 
all their positions in that sector. Some 40 enemy soldiers were 
killed and one tank and one artillery piece were destroyed. Two 
fighters were killed and 11 were wounded on the Karabakh side. 
  The Azerbaijani Air Force planes bombed the Karabakh 
positions around Fizuli this morning. We have received no 
reports on the consequences. 
  No substantial changes have taken place on the other fronts.

  [Text] The proposal that Nagorno-Karabakh remains within 
the composition of Azerbaijan on the basis of a federal system 
is unacceptable, Secretary of the Armenian Parliamentary 
Commission on Nagorno-Karabakh, Suren Zolyan, told Interfax. 
  The proposal was put forward by Armenian permanent 
representative in Moscow, Felix Mamikonyan. He said it was 
naive to expect that the 170,000 Nagorno-Karabakh people would 
win over the 7 Mn Azerbaijani nation. 
  Zolyan repeated that a resolution was adopted by the 
Armenian 
Supreme Soviet on July 8, 1992, in accordance with which Armenia 
would recognize no document in which Nagorno-Karabakh is 
mentioned as an integral part of Azerbaijan. 
  Zolyan stressed that the will of the Nagorno-Karabakh people 
must be the decisive point when settling this issue. He pointed 
out that the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic had 
been proclaimed through a nation-wide referendum. 
  Baku refuses to recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. 
  Zolyan spoke for the continuation of negotiations between 
the 
Azerbaijani and Karabakh leadership to search for a political 
settlement in the region.

<F P=106> [Gevorg Nazaryan report on Council of Ministers Presidium </F>
extraordinary session at the nuclear power plant on 24 March] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Grant Bagraytan and ministers took 
part in the extraordinary session. The visit by the Presidium 
members to the plant was proof that the plant is at the center 
of the leadership's attention. 
  Inspecting the work being carried out there, we were 
convinced that much time and effort is needed to cool and 
reoperate the reactor. Suren Azatyan, director of the Armenian 
nuclear plant, gave detailed information to the officials on the 
situation at the plant and on the progress of the work. 
  The presence of the Republic's President Levon Ter-Petrosyan 
lent extra importance to the extraordinary session. The 
president chaired the meeting. Armenian Deputy Prime Minister 
Vigen Chitechyan delivered a report on the progress of the work 
to reoperate the nuclear plant. 
  The session established the bylaws of the Metsamor Nuclear 
Power Station Special State Enterprise attached to the Armenian 
Ministry of Energy and Fuel. Economy Minister Armen Yegiazaryan 
delivered a report on the system of payments and social security 
for the employees involved in the work to reopen the plant. 
Energy and Fuel Minister Miron Shishmanyan also spoke at the 
meeting.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from Armenian </F>
nuclear power station by Vladimir Nazaryan] 
  [Text] [Nazaryan] A year ago, when it became obvious that 
the energy crisis in Armenia was insurmountable and that the 
situation was deteriorating with every passing winter, the 
republic government adopted the decision to de-mothball the 
nuclear power station at Metsamor. Eighteen months were set 
aside for reactivating one of the two 400 MW power units. 
However, soon it became clear that it was impossible to master 
this task single-handed, and that the station was not likely to 
resume production by the following spring. 
  The signing of a Russian-Armenian agreement has brought new 
hope. According to this document, all restoration work 
including recommissioning will now be carried out jointly. The 
Russian side will be responsible for all engineering and 
technical operations necessary to start up the station again, as 
well as for the delivery of nuclear fuel and all help required 
in training specialists. The Armenian side will be in charge of 
the safety and physical protection of the nuclear power station. 
Furthermore, Armenia guarantees that it will not make use of 
nuclear and other special materials needed at the nuclear power 
plant for the production of nuclear weapons or the achievement 
of any other military aims.

  [Text] The Defense Ministry Press Service has reported that 
following their unsuccessful attacks on 23 March, the Armenian 
units have regrouped their forces and are trying to break 
through our Army's defensive line. 
  Supported by six tanks and three armored cars, an enemy 
infantry battalion launched an attack from occupied (Gorgan) 
against our positions in Fizulinskiy Rayon on the afternoon of 
23 March. Following fierce battles, which lasted until midnight, 
the Armenians were forced to withdraw after losing four tanks 
and an armored car. Some 300 soldiers were killed or wounded. 
  One of our armored cars was damaged and eight of our 
soldiers 
were killed and 22 wounded during the fighting. 
  Only positional fighting is continuing on the Agdamskiy, 
Terterskiy, and Kelbadzharskiy fronts. An enemy armored car was 
hit in Agdamskiy Rayon. Our troops have gained better strategic 
positions in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon.

  [Text] Baku, 24 Mar (AZERTAC) -- The Azerbaijani Supreme 
Soviet intends to ask the Russian Duma to return the former 
leaders of the Republic who are now living in Moscow, namely 
Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov and Ayaz Mutalibov. 
  This was stated by Azerbaijani Parliament Chairman Rasul 
Guliyev at today's session of the Republic's National Assembly 
(Parliament). The session continued to discuss the tragic 
incidents in Baku in January 1990. 
  According to the parliament chairman, the involvement of 
these two former high-ranking officials in the Baku massacre has 
been proven. The archives that came to light show that on the 
night of 20 January 1990 Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, the first 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist 
Party, was in the headquarters of the Army unit stationed in 
Baku and, together with the former Soviet Defense Minister 
Dmitriy Yazov and the former Soviet Interior Minister Vadim 
Bakatin, directed the deployment of the special purpose 
detachments in the Azerbaijani capital. 
  The investigation has also revealed that Ayaz Mutalibov 
asked 
the former Soviet leadership to urgently send an additional 
contingent to Baku. The dispatch of this contingent resulted in 
a greater tragedy. Mutalibov exploited the situation to take 
power. 
  Claims to the effect that the Republic's leadership was 
unaware of the introduction of a state of emergency and the 
deployment of troops in Baku were also exposed as lies. The 
documents and witnesses attest that they knew of these 
developments a day before the tragedy.

  [Text] According to available information, the Armenian 
Republic has appealed to the Russian Federation over reopening 
the nuclear power station shut down following the Spitak 
earthquake in 1988. This report caused serious concern in 
Azerbaijan and in all the neighboring countries located in an 
unstable seismic zone. 
  The Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences and the Ecology and 
Environmental Protection Committee held a joint meeting today to 
discuss this issue in depth. It was announced that such nuclear 
stations, which are not up to international radiation safety 
standards and pose a serious threat to the surrounding region, 
cannot reoperate. 
  In view of this and to draw the international community's 
attention to the problem, the Azerbaijani scientists and 
specialists have appealed to the United Nations, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Ministries of 
Ecology in Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Georgia to seek their help 
in ensuring radiation safety for the region.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 24 Mar -- According to the Iberia news 
agency, the Georgian head of state, Eduard Shevardnadze, met a 
NATO delegation today. During the meeting, the head of state 
spoke of his striving towards friendship between NATO and 
Russia, Georgia, and the CIS states. He said that the 
restoration of Cold War would stir up reactionary forces, and 
this could be tragical in effect for many small countries. 
Today, when even the United Nations fails to render a real help 
to this or that country in the settlement of a conflict, NATO's 
role as that of a guarantor of stability has further increased, 
Shevardnadze said. 
  The head of the NATO delegation, an official representative 
of the Republic of Turkey in NATO, Tugay Ozceni, welcomed 
Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace initiative. He said 
NATO intended to extend the cooperation with Georgia including 
the military sphere.

  [Text] After heavy fighting on Friday morning, Abkhazian 
units have seized the village of Nizhnya Lata in the republic's 
mountainous region of Gulripsha where Georgian forces entrenched 
themselves after being driven out of Sukhumi last fall, 
Abkhazian military officials told Interfax. 
  Regional fighting renewed on Thursday after two Georgian 
battalions supported by armor had tried to break through tunnels 
in Kodor Pass. 
  A deputy Abkhazian defence minister described the attack as 
well- prepared but Abkhazian troops stepped in quickly to 
suppress it. 
  Two Georgian tanks were destroyed as well as one artillery 
piece and one rocket launcher. Several Abkhazian soldiers were 
injured. 
  The Abkhazian defence ministry fears a possible attack on 
Abkhazian positions amid reports of Georgian troop concentration 
along the Ingur river separating the two sides. 
  In the meantime, head of Abkhazia's pro-Georgian government 
Zurab Erkvania told our correspondent in Tbilisi that the 
Abkhazians burnt down the village of Nabakevi in the Gal region.

away from Sukhumi) since September 1993, started on Thursday 
morning and continued throughout the day. The Abkhazian Defense 
Ministry told Interfax that the Abkhazian army had taken the 
initiative and forced the Georgian formations to retreat to the 
canyon. According to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry, the 
Georgian side suffered casualties. The Georgian troops also lost 
two tanks, a Shilka anti-aircraft mounting and several artillery 
weapons. 
  Non-official sources maintain that there are up to 1,500 
people in the Georgian formations and a large amount of military 
equipment. Abkhazian military experts believe that if the 
Georgian formations break the blockade they will secure an 
advantageous position for sabotage and other military 
operations, including in Sukhumi (the Abkhazian capital). 
  The Abkhazian Defense Ministry told Interfax that a 
significant number of Georgian servicemen and military armored 
equipment had been gathered on the Georgian-Abkhazian border 
lying on the Inguri River. 
  Most Georgian servicemen were gathered near the populated 
center of Jvari which is quite close to the Inguri Hydro 
Electric Power Station, Abkhazian intelligence reported.

<F P=106> [Video report by unidentified correspondent, including </F>
recorded comment by Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze] 
  [Excerpt] [Correspondent] Media information today on combat 
activities in the Kodor Canyon of Abkhazia between a local Svan 
population group and Vladislav Ardzinba's armed formations was 
also confirmed by the Georgian head of state, who also holds the 
post of defense minister. Eduard Shevardnadze said the 
initiator of the combat activities was the Abkhazian side, 
attempting for the third time to dislodge the Svan population 
from Kodor Canyon. As a result of previous attacks, the 
Abkhazians had succeeded in advancing and occupying the 
so-called [words indistinct]. The Georgian Defense Ministry 
told us today that the Abkhazian side opened artillery fire this 
morning on villages in Kodor Canyon, leading to casualties among 
the civilian population. Regarding the armament of the Georgian 
population, Shevardnadze said: 
  [Shevardnadze] The equipment there is not in fact in working 
order. It is the equipment that was withdrawn following the 
evacuation of Sukhumi. It is not capable of carrying out combat 
tasks. If something is being done there, it is only 
self-defense, nothing more. 
  [Correspondent] Eduard Shevardnadze called the beginning of 
combat operations an attempt to disrupt the political settlement 
of the Abkhazian conflict. 
  [Shevardnadze] The question of beginning a new round of 
talks 
is now under discussion. The UN secretary general, his personal 
representative, is calling for it. I think this is the latest 
act [designed] to disrupt [the talks]. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba said Abkhazia 
was ready to resume its dialogue with Georgia, but not before 
the latter repealed its March 10 decision to disband Abkhazia's 
legislature and government. 
  "The resumption of war in Abkhazia will hardly be possible 
if 
the Georgian leadership takes a reasonable path," Ardzinba told 
Interfax and Abkhazian television on Wednesday. 
  He reiterated the Abkhazian leadership's demand that a U.N. 
peacekeeping force be deployed only along the Inguri River, 
marking the border between Abkhazia and Georgia. 
  Ardzinba said the leaders of the republics and regions of 
southern Russia and Abkhazia would be meeting in the Russian 
city of Krasnodar early next month. He expressed gratitude to 
the city's administration for organizing the meeting, which he 
expected to focus, among other things, on the problem of the 
border between Abkhazia and Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Republic </F>
of Abkhazia Supreme Soviet, by Svetlana Shipunova; place and 
date not given: "Between Peace and War"] 
  [Text] I last met with Vladislav Ardzinba at the end of 
August 1993, in Gudauta. At the time combat operations had not 
yet ceased on the territory of Abkhazia, but everything already 
pointed to the fact that Georgia had lost this war, and everyone 
was living in expectation of imminent victory and long-awaited 
peace. I talked with the Abkhaz leader about his vision of his 
republic's future after the war. 
  The war ended 30 September. Over the six months since then 
Abkhazia has not had time to heal its wounds and to restore 
normal life, particularly as Russia has maintained an economic 
blockade of the republic throughout the winter. And yet it has 
survived! A bread-baking plant, a tobacco factory, and even 
enterprises such as Sukhumpribor (the only plant in the former 
Union to produce ballpoint pen refills) have been restored and 
have started working. Public transport is functioning, and old 
people on pensions are provided with three free meals a day in 
enterprise cafeterias. In Sukhumi the seafront, public gardens, 
and parks have been cleared of obstructions and traces of 
fighting, and coffee shops and small stores have started 
opening. Of course things are difficult, there is no fuel or 
raw materials for enterprises, there is a food shortage, people 
live mainly on what they themselves grow, and there is a 
catastrophic shortage of money, since Abkhazia has been cut off 
financially from both Georgia and Russia. 
  It is difficult to organize a normal life for people -- as 
much as 40 percent of the housing is in an unfit state, blocks 
have been destroyed, and apartments looted. A special housing 
commission, which includes old people, representatives of the 
intelligentsia, and participants in the war, is now working 
under the Sukhumi Administration. Housing authorizations 
(temporary ones) are issued primarily to families of deceased 
persons, to people whose homes have been burned down, and to 
invalids from last year's war. Refugees are returning little by 
little to Abkhazia -- Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Georgians 
(but only those who did not participate in combat operations 
against it). 
  The agonizingly difficult process of restoring a peaceful 
life is exacerbated by the fact that there has been no political 
settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz problem, and Abkhazia's status 
has not been defined. 
  With the onset of spring people have suddenly started 
speaking once again of war and the possible resumption of combat 
operations on Abkhazian territory. The situation in this region 
has again started to exacerbate, and tension is increasing day 
by day. I talked about this with Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Abkhazia. He had just 
returned from a big foreign tour -- he had been to Switzerland, 
New York, and Moscow, where he met with officials and gave news 
conferences. 
  "Surely not war again?" I asked him. "How do you rate the 
likelihood of such a development of events?" 
  [Ardzinba] There are at least two circumstances that are 
intensifying aggressive sentiment in the Georgian leadership and 
prompting it to attempt to take revenge. These are, first, the 
signing of the treaty with Russia and, second, the support which 
Shevardnadze has once again received in the West, particularly 
during his recent U.S. trip. I must remind you that, when the 
war was still being waged in our country, the Russian leadership 
made repeated statements to the effect that no treaty would be 
signed with Georgia until the situation in Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia had been settled in full. But, despite its own 
statements and despite the fact that there has been no 
settlement and, what is more, there is still a threat that 
combat operations will be resumed, Russia signed the treaty. At 
the same time it recognized Georgia's territorial integrity. 
What does this mean from a legal viewpoint? Only that Russia 
has no territorial claims on Georgia. But the Georgian 
leadership interprets this as recognizing that Abkhazia is part 
of Georgia, although that is another matter -- a matter of our 
internal relations. 
  [Shipunova] Vladislav Grigoryevich, what danger do you see 
in the treaty concluded by Russia and Georgia? 
  [Ardzinba] The fact that it contains articles on the 
handover of arms to Georgia and on assistance for it in 
reorganizing the army. Thus, this is a repeat of the situation 
which existed in 1992, when Georgia obtained arms under the 
Tashkent Agreement -- after which it at once unleashed 
aggression. Today, by undertaking to arm Georgia, Russia is 
again giving it carte blanche to wage war. Shevardnadze's 
repeated statements, notably at a UN Security Council session, 
that the situation could get out of control have certainly not 
been accidental. Later he will most likely use them to justify 
renewing combat operations, particularly as there have already 
been several armed raids by Georgia in Galskiy Rayon, on the 
border. 
  [Shipunova] And yet the treaty has not yet been ratified, 
has it? 
  [Ardzinba] That is of no great importance, since a number of 
agreements have been signed in addition to the treaty, including 
agreements on the status of the border troops, on the status of 
the Russian Armed Forces on the territory of Georgia, etc., and 
these agreements include the same articles on military questions 
as the treaty itself. So these agreements have already started 
to be implemented, without any ratification. For example, 
Georgian youths will now be drafted into the border troops and 
will receive weapons; this work is already being developed. 
  [Shipunova] Did you make any attempt to prevent the signing 
of the treaty, and did you have contacts in this regard with 
anyone in the Russian leadership? 
  [Ardzinba] Unfortunately we are unable to have normal 
contacts with the leadership of Russia. All our appeals and 
warnings of the possible dangerous development of events have 
gone unheeded. Yet not only we but also many political forces 
in Russia itself have spoken out against the treaty! There was 
the appeal by all factions in the State Duma on the eve of 
President Yeltsin's trip to Tbilisi; all the North Caucasus 
leaders, who also had a negative attitude to the upcoming 
signing, gathered at the Foreign Ministry; there was the appeal 
by a whole series of Federation Council members.... To our 
great sorrow, all these opinions were also disregarded. 
  I would like to emphasize that, in the event of Georgia's 
commencing combat operations, the responsibility for this will 
also lie with those who secured the signing of the 
Russian-Georgian treaty. 
  [Shipunova] What forces are they, do you believe, and who in 
Russia could benefit by this? 
  [Ardzinba] Certain circles in Russia take a strange stand on 
their own country's security and pursue a policy in the 
interests of the West rather than of Russia itself. But the 
West has no need either of a strong Georgia or of a strong 
Russia; it is simply using the present situation in our country 
to increase its own influence and even presence in this region. 
  [Shipunova] Do you have in mind the plans to send UN 
peacemaking forces into Abkhazia? 
  [Ardzinba] Shevardnadze does not conceal the reason why he 
wants the peacemaking forces. In order to disarm the Abkhaz 
army, abolish Abhazia's state power bodies, and set up some 
directorate to run our state. Thus, it is a question of 
Abkhazia's occupation by UN forces and of those forces' 
resolving the problems which Shevardnadze was unable to resolve 
with his tanks last year. He evidently received assurances of 
support in the United States. Shevardnadze's report to the 
Security Council spoke bluntly about creating a precedent for 
the use of "blue helmets" in hot spots in the former Union. As 
we know, there are many such spots on USSR territory of the 
USSR, and once it starts.... 
  [Shipunova] You disagree with this version of a 
"settlement." What, then, are your proposals? 
  [Ardzinba] The point is that our proposals and the Abkhaz 
side's position in this conflict in general are hushed up and 
distorted in every possible way both in Russia and in the West. 
I saw this for myself during my trip abroad and my meetings 
with representatives of international organizations. The 
Georgian side portrays the matter as though Abkhazia is also 
agreeable to the sending in of peacemaking troops throughout the 
territory from the Ingur [Inguri] river to the Psou river. This 
is not so, in actual fact. Whereas such troops really could 
fulfill a disengaging role along the Ingur, which forms the 
actual border between Abkhazia and Georgia, I cannot understand 
against whom they will guard us on the Psou, which forms the 
border between Abkhazia and Russia. Against attack from the 
Russian Federation? Or is it that someone would like to station 
his troops along Russia's borders? 
  Our version of a settlement is that the opposing sides 
should pull back their troops a certain distance (3-5 km) on the 
border along the Ingur and that peacemaking forces should enter 
the corridor so formed. At the same time we have always said 
that Russian, not UN, troops should be used as peacemaking 
troops. International forces would be present here only as 
observers. If the chief aim is to be viewed as preventing the 
resumption of combat operations, this option is more than 
adequate. But the trouble is that Georgia's aim is quite 
different, because it does not seek a peace settlement and is 
not abandoning its plans to crush and subjugate Abkhazia, 
depriving it of its own statehood, i.e. it prefers the 
strong-arm option for resolving the problem. 
  From November 1993 we held talks with the Georgian side in 
Geneva and New York, and a memorandum and a communique were 
prepared which said that the sides would no longer use force. 
There were several opportunities to sign these documents, but 
their signing was thwarted, the decisive role in this being 
played by Shevardnadze's U.S. trip and by the U.S. 
Administration's support for his plans. In the United States 
Shevardnadze signed a joint statement with the Americans on 
military cooperation, according to which the United States will 
assist Georgia in reorganizing and arming the army, and a 
document was also signed on the creation of a joint security 
program (?!). 
  One gets the impression that UN membership gives a state the 
right to carry out both aggression and genocide against another 
people with impunity. Georgia started the war in Abkhazia two 
weeks after its admission to the United Nations. It was 
admitted contrary to the organization's Charter, being at that 
time a country without a legally elected leadership since its 
leaders had come in as the result of a coup d'etat. The 
decision itself was adopted by means of a poll [oprosnym putem], 
so it could be said that it was not Georgia that was admitted to 
the United Nations but Shevardnadze, evidently for his past 
"services." These violations also formed the basis of the 
Georgian leader's further unpunished conduct in respect of other 
peoples, moreover human rights are also being grossly violated 
in his own country, where what is virtually an authoritarian 
regime has been established and all dissidence is crushed. 
  [Shipunova] Shevardnadze called the Georgian parliament's 
decision to dissolve the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet "hasty," thus 
apparently dissociating himself from it. What do you think 
about this? 
  [Ardzinba] This is his usual subterfuge, an attempt to 
mislead. The decision adopted in Tbilisi stems directly from 
Shevardnadze's UN speech, and these are all links in the same 
chain. The Georgian parliament's decision is an unlawful 
document, it is.... 
  You know, it is a work of literature, running to many pages. 
It contains such "pearls" as this, for example: "The 
Abkhazians seized part of sovereign Georgia -- Abkhazia...." It 
is illegal even from the viewpoint of their own constitution, 
which does not feature any Abkhaz ASSR [Autonomous Soviet 
Socialist Republic] or any autonomous entities at all. It was 
by adopting such a constitution that they initiated the conflict 
in the first place. Relations between Georgia and Abkhazia 
ceased de facto two years ago. From a legal viewpoint Georgia 
and Abkhazia are in no way linked today. There has long been no 
Abkhaz ASSR. There is the Republic of Abkhazia with its own 
constitution and its own legally elected organs of power. 
Therefore it is possible to talk about one thing only -- the 
restoration of interstate relations between the two republics by 
concluding a treaty. We have been moving toward this, but such 
a development of events does not suit Georgia's leaders. So the 
Geneva talks are frustrated, the treaty with Russia is signed 
regardless of our positions and interests, then comes the appeal 
to the United Nations for military aid, and finally the totally 
illegal decision of the Georgian parliament is adopted on the 
dissolution of our republic's organs of power and even...on the 
institution of criminal proceedings against Abkhaz deputies! 
  By all these actions the Georgian side unilaterally put an 
end to the process of a peaceful political settlement. 
  [Shipunova] What do you intend to do in the present 
situation? 
  [Ardzinba] My trip abroad had the purpose of conveying our 
position to the world community and opening eyes to the actual 
state of affairs, since Georgia misleads everyone about 
Abkhazia's statehood and about our historical and present 
relations. The concepts of "separatism" and "violation of 
territorial integrity" do not apply to our situation. I met 
with UN Security Council President Merimee, with UN Under 
Secretary General Goulding, with the ambassadors of a number of 
countries, and with representatives of the UN peacemaking forces 
command and also of the U.S. Department of State. I believe 
that the meetings were mutually useful, since Abkhazia's true 
position on all questions of our conflict was explained, and the 
Abkhaz leadership's official appeals to the Security Council 
were handed over. A great deal came as a revelation to my 
interlocutors, because hitherto they had listened to and heard 
just one side here -- the Georgian side. 
  [Shipunova] It is known that you have also proposed to the 
leaders of the Federation components in the North Caucasus the 
holding of a meeting in Sukhumi.... 
  [Ardzinba] Yes, and I received their agreement in principle 
to such a meeting. We have not yet decided finally on the 
venue, and the crux of the matter is not whether it is held in 
Sukhumi or in one of the North Caucasus capitals. The chief 
thing is that we are seeking support not abroad but from our own 
compatriots and brothers. We intend, in particular, to invite 
representatives of the peoples of the North Caucasus as 
permanent observers in Abkhazia. 
  [Shipunova] Does all this mean that you are preparing for 
war? Will a possible decision to send UN troops onto the 
territory of Abkhazia mean the start of a new war? 
  [Ardzinba] I must declare most definitely that we will 
perceive any decision to which the Abkhaz side does not agree as 
an attempt at occupation, with all the ensuing consequences. It 
is not hard to surmise what the result of this will be not only 
in Abkhazia but also throughout the Caucasus region. Today we 
have been forced to strengthen our defenses, but we are not 
abandoning hopes and efforts aimed at resuming the talks 
process. If the Georgian parliament repeals its illegal 
decision, that will open the way to continuing the peace talks. 
We do not want war, and we will do everything to prevent a new 
armed clash. This also applies to the question of refugees. 
Yes, we oppose the return to Abkhazia of persons who 
participated in combat operations with weapon in hand and who 
continue to pose a threat to Abkhazia's security. They cannot 
return until there has been a full settlement of the conflict. 
This insistence of ours is natural. The situation in Abkhazia 
today is peaceful and calm. We are endeavoring to maintain it. 
But, I repeat, much will depend on the stand that Russia takes 
this time. [Ardzinba ends] 
  I was completing the preparation of this material for 
publication when I learned of a statement made by UN Secretary 
General Butrus Ghali. In it he admits that the necessary 
conditions do not exist in Abkhazia at present for sending in UN 
peacemaking forces. This statement inspires hope that common 
sense and political realism will, after all, triumph in the 
world community's attitude to the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. But 
Russia, nonetheless, will have the last say. It is still not 
too late to prevent new bloodshed.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Koretskiy: "Enrollment for Abkhaz </F>
`Fifth Column' Has been Announced. Overthrow of Ardzinba Being 
Prepared"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Aleksandr Chikvadze, head of the 
Georgian Foreign Ministry, signed in Brussels an agreement on 
Georgia's joining the Partnership for Peace program. This is 
the first time that a country in a state of civil war intends to 
join it. Besides, the joining of the NATO program takes on a 
special meaning with the emergence in Abkhazia of a pro-Georgia 
secret organization. 
  The probability of the countries in conflict reaching an 
agreement is small despite the recent statements by Eduard 
Shevardnadze and Vladislav Ardzinba for the continuation of 
dialogue. Now the conflict may flare up in Abkhazia itself, 
where a secret organization "For a Peaceful Abkhazia" (its 
membership and national composition are unknown) has announced 
about existence. An appeal to Butros-Ghali, Boris Yeltsin, and 
Eduard Shevardnadze, circulated yesterday in Tbilisi by members 
of the underground organization points to their intention "to 
come out weapons in hand against the Ardzinba regime" if the 
latter fails to agree with Georgia. Besides, unless the United 
Nations urgently steps into the conflict, "a genocide of the 
Georgian population in Abkhazia may lead to irreparable 
consequences." The way out, in the underground organization 
members' view, is to bring Russian troops and Georgian police 
into Abkhazia. 
  In Shevardnadze's opinion, the organization consists of 
Abkhaz people and is in no way connected with Tbilisi. 
Information received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY from informed sources 
put in doubt the existence of this organization (most people in 
Abkhazia are more anti-Georgia than anti-Ardzinba) and gives 
grounds to believe that the creation of the "For a Peaceful 
Abkhazia" movement was not done without Tbilisi, which in the 
standoff in Sukhumi is using the old "fifth column" principle. 
A conflagration in the autonomous entity would undoubtedly 
spark a reaction in the world. And in this event, NATO may 
think it right for it to interfere ahead of the UN "blue 
helmets" unless the underground appeal first draws a reaction 
from Moscow, which has repeatedly stated that it is not going to 
ask for UN permission for peacekeeping every time.

<F P=106> [Speech by Georgian State Council Chairman Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze at the First Congress of the Union of Georgia's 
Citizens in Tbilisi on 20 March -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] My speech is rather long. Every problem 
requires at least a little attention. I have to speak of things 
that are of significant importance for the Union [of Georgia's 
Citizens] as well as the whole country. If we can, let us 
endure. 
  Citizens -- I do want this word to become customary for 
addressing. The first congress of the Union of Georgia's 
Citizens is a real occasion. A new mass political movement has 
been established, which aims to create a democratic, civic 
society and an independent, sovereign, and lawful state with a 
new market economy, new culture, new internal and foreign policy. 
  The Union of Citizens is, first and foremost, a party of 
cardinal reforms and a movement of reformers. The outlines of 
economic, political, and social reforms of the Union of Citizens 
will be based on the program and regulation principles that we 
have already approved. 
  Our activity will be based not on -isms and speculations on 
the hardships of the people but on real and effective policy. A 
citizen with his family, a free individual with his interests, 
honors, duties, and responsibilities is a cornerstone and a 
concern of the Union, a source of its power and existence. 
[passage omitted]. 
  Documents drafted by the Union of Georgia's Citizens have 
received the approval of the International Monetary Fund, the 
World Bank, the Eurobank, the European Union, and a number of 
other international organizations. [passage omitted] 
  Conflicts supported by outside forces are taking place in 
Georgia at present. The political, economic, financial, social, 
and spiritual crisis is being aggravated further. There are a 
few internal and external factors contributing to the 
aggravation of the crisis, and they require consideration. 
  The old totalitarian system has fallen, but a new democratic 
system has not been built yet. [passage omitted] 
  A transitional period, which began in the 80s and still 
continues, implies the replacement of one social structure with 
another and consequently a complex and contradictory process. 
  A program to help Georgia escape the crisis stipulates that 
the scientifically forecasted first stage of a transitional 
period will last approximately three years and that the second 
stage will last five years, until the year 2000. My forecast 
made during my election campaign at the Academy of Sciences does 
not really conform with this new forecast because the situation 
has changed in the country and some of our plans have been 
ruined. 
  From 1995, political, economic, and social stabilization 
will 
begin. Although an acute critical situation will still be felt 
until 1996. Then, a new steady stage of stabilization will 
come, and this will last until the end of the century. Our 
strategic target is to establish a new Georgian state based on 
law with a new market economy and a new civic society. To 
achieve this target, it is necessary to adopt a new 
constutution, the basic law of the state. 
  Several words about the Constitution. As you know, the 
Constitution of 1921 is currently in force. It was revived in 
February 1992 by the military council. The constitutional law 
on power adopted on 6 November 1992 by parliament was a correct 
decision. 
  It is necessary to make amendments to the 1921 Constitution, 
thus creating a new constitution. To this end, the 
constitutional commission has been set up and is chaired by the 
head of state; the commission is completing work on the draft. 
  What will the realistic revival of the 1921 Constitution and 
its revision give us? First, the authority of Georgia as a 
state having a long constitutional history will grow; second, 
the truly democratic norms and principles of the 1921 
Constitution will be implemented, which will help to overcome 
the crisis, consolidate society, and neutralize those forces 
that are resorting to political speculation over the issues of 
the 1921 Constitution to exacerbate the crisis and destabllize 
society. [passage omitted] 
  The new edition of the constitution must be based on the 
following firm principles of the national constitution and world 
constitutional tradition: 
  1. The source of state power in Georgia lies in the people 
of Georgia; power is wielded by the people for the people. 
People ensure their sovereignty by means of their immediate and 
representative bodies. 
  2. The constitution recognizes the superiority of 
international law. 
  3. The constitution is an executive enactment. 
  4. Strong state power is based on the principle of 
division of power to preclude the sole control of any of its 
constituent circles and the infringement on people's human 
rights. 
  5. A strong state acts within the maximum framework of 
democracy. [passage omitted] 
  These are some guarantees with the help of which the danger 
should not emerge again in Georgia and the plague, as I once 
called it, should not occur. 
  Acknowledgement by the state of basic human rights and the 
possibility of securing them in court [passage indistinct] 
according to which voters give a mandate to the head of state, 
parliament, self-governing bodies, and officials. 
  The referendum -- a general popular voting -- will decide 
the 
country's most crucial issues, including the powerful and 
independent authority of the court, which will have power to 
withstand any kind of violence and injustice, and will resolve 
the issues connected with ethnic minorities, according to 
European and world standards. On the one hand, a man must be 
protected from state pressure by the constitution, law, and 
natural rights; on the other hand, a realistic constitutional 
defense will secure a democratic country from the danger of 
totalitarianizm, dictatorship, anarchy, and [word indistinct]. 
  The constitution must make the historical process of 
establishing democracy irreversible -- such is the stance of the 
Union of Citizens of Georgia. [passage omitted] 
  The new revised version of the 1921 Constitution, in my 
opinion, must consider the following executive bodies: a 
not-too- large parliament with two chambers, the president of 
the republic, the cabinet of ministers, and a constitutional and 
executive court. The Union of Citizens of Georgia believes that 
state power should be divided into legislative, executive, and 
judicial powers based on world experience. 
  The new law-abiding and democratic state must be a 
pluralistic and free state with a new type of democracy, which 
would be a guarantor [words indistinct]. 
  One of the main strategic aims of the activities of the 
Union 
of Citizens of Georgia is representation in parliament and a 
business- like cooperation with parliament. [passage omitted] 
  The legislative situation in Georgia is very complex now. 
The Soviet legislation is in force -- please, pay attention to 
this -- as is the legislation adopted in 1991, decrees and 
resolutions adopted by the military and [word indistinct] 
councils, the legislation adopted since November 1992, and the 
Georgian Constitution of 1921. It is difficult to speak of a 
system when we have to deal with such instances. Proceding from 
the above, we think that the available legislation must be 
looked through thoroughly. We must define which enforceable 
enactment could be used today and which should be immediately 
changed. Along with preparing a new draft constitution, the 
state program envisages adopting new laws. In particular, I 
shall point out some of those laws that are of a fundamental 
importance for our society from the point of view of building a 
law-based state and getting the economy out of the crisis: the 
adoption and discussion of draft laws that have already been 
prepared must be sped up; the draft law on the industrial 
society, bills, lease, and land-ownership -- especially on 
land-ownership. The process of adopting the law on land- 
ownership has been dragging on. In the meantime, a draft law on 
regulating and monitoring foreign currency, as well as on other 
issues must be prepared. It is impossible to imagine the normal 
functioning of the economic and financial credit system without 
having the above-mentioned laws. The packet of laws on tax must 
include taxes on transactions of valuable papers, transport, 
utilization of natural resources, and other normative documents. 
In the meantime, not only must we pass new laws and documents, 
but we must also improve and perfect the previously-adopted 
documents. They already need perfecting, and a number of 
amendments must be made to them. 
  [Excerpts] I would like you to pay attention to the 
following: it is of a particular importance to perfect economic 
legislation to attract foreign capital and establish a favorable 
atmosphere. Mainly, I mean the law on investments and foreign 
investments. The first question we were asked by businessmen 
in the United States was about our legislation concerning 
foreign investments. If this legislation aims to stimulate 
foreign investment, then they will move toward Georgia, as we 
have a unique geographic and geopolitical situation. [passage 
omitted] 
  Winning in the future parliamentary elections must mean 
establishing stability in parliament and the country as a whole. 
The revision of the constitution must secure a high status for 
parliament, the structure of a pliable body, and envisage the 
demands of a modern parliament and its specific features. This 
is how I see it: parliament must have two chambers, the lower 
chamber -- the council of the republic -- and the upper chamber 
-- the council of representatives; it will be discussed in 
detail in the draft constitution. Parliament will have 
legislative and monitoring functions and will have the right to 
pass a vote of no confidence in the government and dismiss it. 
  The new parliament must be able, as is accepted in developed 
countries, to dismiss the republic's president or the comparable 
official. The new parliament must be able to hold new 
presidential elections; the president will have the right to 
dismiss parliament and hold elections to a new parliament. This 
is also important. Anyway, this is our stance. [passage omitted] 
  It would be expedient if parliament is granted the right to 
carry out only executive parliamentary control over the 
government's activities, which would rule out parliament's 
interference into a sphere of purely governmental activity. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia believes that the 
reorganization of parliament and the establishment of a new 
parliament are key to overcoming the crisis and stabilizing the 
political, social, and economic situation. 
  Several words about the executive power. 
  The head of state today is at the same time the chairman of 
parliament. It reflects the peculiarities of a transitional 
historical stage and combining the two jobs was temporary. In 
the opinion of the union -- well, it is my own opinion anyway, 
and probably my organization will share my point of view -- the 
introduction of the presidential post must be envisaged in the 
new constitution as of the year 1995. It is necessary for 
overcoming the crisis of authority and for economic and social 
stability. 
  Georgia must have a strong parliamentary and presidential 
power. It is in Georgia's national interests. The republic's 
president in the future must have wide constitutional rights, as 
is accepted worldwide. The republic's president must be a 
guarantor for the country's independence, territorial integrity, 
and the normal constitutional functioning of the state's 
governing bodies. 
  The president must, of course, be elected by the people. 
  In the opinion of the Union of Citizens of Georgia, 
establishing strong presidential power in Georgia will help 
overcome the political, economic, and social crisis in our 
country. 
  This is how I see the cabinet of ministers. As is known, 
the cabinet of ministers, ministries, departments, corporations, 
and other establishments have been reorganized. The cabinet of 
ministers has worked out a serious anti-crisis program, which we 
shall talk about later. In the meantime, the activities of the 
cabinet of ministers, ministries, and departments deserve 
serious criticism in carrying out reforms and generally 
overcoming the crisis. To reinforce the executive power and 
perfect its activity, it is necessary to make constructive 
amendments to the law on the cabinet of ministers and radically 
reform the structure of the cabinet of ministers, forms of work 
and methods. The cabinet of ministers, ministries and 
departments are failing in carrying out radical reforms. 
  In this connection, I would like to say that I cannot agree 
with those who think that it is necessary to dismiss the cabinet 
of ministers now and create a new government, and so on. I must 
say upfront that it is not difficult to do; we can adopt a 
resolution today on the dismissal of the government, but I have 
no authority to do so and neither is it possible for me to 
present a worthy new cabinet. Specific ministers and ministries 
must be replaced: those who are corrupt. And if we have 
evidence of corruption, then the ministers should leave the 
government and be made accountable. But the nucleus of the 
cabinet of ministers must be retained. We have no choice at 
this stage. When the Union of Citizens completely comes to 
power, then you will see [passage indistinct] [passage omitted] 
  The government will be subordinated to the president, 
parliament, and partially to the constitutional law, which will 
define the terms of operation of government documents and 
[passage indistinct]. Ministries must be, first of all, 
political institutions and not industrial ones, but at the 
moment, they [passage indistinct]. 
  Parliamentarians are right in saying that the 
voter-parliament-parliament structures-government 
inter-responsibility must be put into action. Parliament must 
work out a long-term program for building a law-based state; the 
cabinet of ministers must work out a program for carrying out 
economic and social reforms and overcoming the crisis. I must 
say that parliament has no such program and the program of the 
cabinet of ministers is not effective. [passage omitted] 
These reforms, on the one hand, will facilitate the 
establishment of a new state order, overcome the general crisis, 
and reinforce order, and, on the other hand, they will speed up 
the process of building a democratic state and bringing into 
effect the constitution and laws. This is in brief how the 
Union of Citizens of Georgia sees the reforms in the 
legislative, executive, and juridical bodies; first the highest 
echelons and parliament, amd them the cabinet of ministers, high 
court, and the constitutional court. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia welcomes Georgia's entry 
into the CIS, the ratification by the Georgian parliament of the 
relevant documents on Georgia's joining the CIS, and the 
granting to Georgia of the status of a developing country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Great changes should take place not only in the executive 
bodies of power but in [word indistinct] of autonomous 
formations [pormireba]. Changes should take place in the 
autonomous republic of Abkhazia after the settlement of the 
conflict, and I think that the conflict will be resolved after 
[passage indistinct]. Constitutional rights must be restored. A 
status secured to an autonomous formation by modern world 
standards is guaranteed to Abkhazia. 
  The conflict must be resolved on the basis of the bilateral 
Russo-Georgian, trilateral Russo-Georgian-Abkhazian, and the 
Geneva agreements. The United Nations, the Security Council, 
the CSCE, and other international organizations must help 
resolve the Abkhaz issue. The Abkhaz issue was addressed with 
gravity in the United Nations, the White House, the Congress, 
Washington, and New York during the recent visit there by the 
Georgian delegation. The Union of Citizens of Georgia supports 
and approves of the activities of the Georgian delegation in 
Moscow, Geneva, Washington, and New York and demands that the 
Abkhaz issue be resolved in a political and peaceful manner. 
Such is our will -- resolving the Abkhaz issue by political and 
peaceful means. Another option, that is, another war will be an 
imposition. Let nobody force us to follow this way. Let nobody 
forget that [passage indistinct] 
  More support should be shown to the Abkhaz salvation 
committee, the Abkhaz council of ministers, the relevant 
commissions of the Georgian parliament, the Georgian deputy 
prime minister for Abkhaz issues, ministries, departments, 
radio, television -- I am talking about Abkhazia -- the press. 
More attention, of course, much more attention, care, warmth, 
and love should be shown to the refugees from Abkhazia and 
Samachablo. These people are our flesh and blood, and they must 
feel it everywhere, at every step they take. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that the 
constitutional status of the autonomous republic of Ajara needs 
to be perfected. We must work actively together with the Ajar 
leader to create a perfect model. 
  Ossetians will live in the Tskhinvali zone after the 
conflict 
is resolved. Please, take this into consideration. Like other 
ethnic minorities, a relevant status should be granted to 
Ossetia; this issue will be resolved through negotiations. 
  I am not going to talk about which of our decisions were 
wrong. I do not want to talk about it -- the redeployment of 
troops in Abkhazia, entering Tskhinvali in such a way, and so on 
and so forth. There will come a time when we will talk about 
these issues. Now, we must seek solutions to these issues, 
therefore, my address is less polemic and is mostly directed 
toward finding solutions and practical measures. 
  Corresponding amendments must be made to the new version of 
the constitution. We must comprehend that conflicts in Abkhazia 
and the Tskhinvali zone are not so much of an ethnic but mostly 
of a political and social nature and are the results of 
interference from a third, foreign force. [passage omitted] 
  It is necessary to carry out reforms in the local and 
municipal authorities, and they must be implemented in 1994-95. 
[passage omitted] 
  The service of the regional management has been set up at 
the 
office of the head of state's staff. This service, although it 
needs to be perfected, is still [passage indistinct]. New 
structures of state management have been established -- the 
mayor's offices in Kutaisi, Poti, Rustavi, Tbilisi, and other 
towns. But these changes are not enough. Thorough reforms are 
needed. Municipal elections should be held and local government 
bodies created; central and local authorities should be 
constitutionally separated. 
  We think that a regional administration -- a qualititively 
new institute of government -- must be established. We still 
need to think about the final model for it. It is an issue for 
discussion. The law will separate the functions of local 
government bodies and the regional administration. Dictatorship 
and [word indistinct] are ruled out. In the opinion of the 
Union of Citizens of Georgia, taking into consideration world 
experience, the system of local government must consist of two 
levels. The first level would include self-government of 
villages, populated areas, and town governments under rayon 
subordination; the second level would include self-governing 
bodies of the republic's towns and rayons. The principle of 
kray-arrangement is not ruled out. Let us think about it 
seriously; it has its pros and cons and optimistic prospects. A 
special two-level system of self-government must also be 
established in Tbilisi. The first level would include Tbilisi 
rayon's municipalities, and the second level would include the 
mayor's office of Tbilisi, the council, and so on. [passage 
omitted] 
  If we want to have armed forces, we must cooperate with the 
Russian Army and the Russian servicemen. There is no other way. 
We have been everywhere, visited every place, and have come to 
the conclusion that this is the only solution for speeding up 
this process. 
  We have wonderful relations with our neighbor, Turkey. Mr. 
Demirel says that we are brothers, and we really are, as rel 
brotherly relations are being established; but could this border 
be opened proceeding either from our interests or the interests 
of Turkey? It would be inadmissible. The narcotics business 
alone will sweep Georgia away and bring calamity to the country. 
Therefore, for the time being, we must preserve the existing 
system of guarding the borders and simultaneously, spend several 
years on training our own border troops. I hope it is a serious 
and stately attitude to the issue. [passage omitted] 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that it is necessary 
to analyze the causes of failure of the Georgian army in 
Abkhazia, draw conclusions, and map out a program for action. 
We must work out a plan for utilization of the potential of the 
modern Georgian military and industrial installations. This 
potential, by the way, is huge. [passage omitted] 
  Every military formation and department on the territory of 
the Republic of Georgia must -- in reality not formally -- be 
submitted to the head of the Georgian state, commander-in-chief 
of armed forces. It is necessary not because I need extra 
powers [Shevardnadze is commander-in-chief of Georgian armed 
forces as well as head of state and chairman of parliament], but 
because in every normal, democratic country this system must be 
established and indeed has been established. 
  It is necessary to disband unlawful armed formations, 
prohibit unlawful carrying of firearms, eradicate the instances 
of plunder and marauding the population by some members of the 
armed forces, reinforce the activities of the military 
procurator's office and the judicial bodies, reinforce 
lawfulness, and establish a single armed forces. Such is our 
aim. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia considers it necessary to 
work out a reliable program for the right strategy and tactics 
to resolve ethnic and social conflicts and consensus between 
nations. We must not lose tolerance, which has been our trait 
for centuries and which has become our national feature. 
Georgia and our future generations must not lose this trait. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that priority should 
be given to the political and peaceful settlement of ethnic and 
social issues and not to the military settlement. We have 
gained a bitter experience in this respect. Theory and 
practical measures must be worked out for overcoming social, 
political, and economic conflicts as well as ethnic conflicts, 
and reaching a consensus between nations. Georgia can make its 
contribution in this respect in the world and cooperate with 
many centers worldwide. 
  You know that the Georgian delegation has recently submitted 
a plan for settling the Abkhaz conflict to the UN Security 
Council. I would like to remind you of some of its points. 
This plan envisages, of course, the safe and honorable return 
of the refugees, holding elections under international 
surveillance, and, on this basis, electing new bodies of power, 
establishing the international directorate with the 
participation of [words indistinct], the Russian Federation, the 
group of Georgia's friends, and other member states of the 
United Nations before holding elections. 
  To carry out the functions of the executive power, a joint 
provisional administration of Abkhazia, which will act under the 
supervision of the international directorate, must be 
established. 
  An international body especially set up under the auspices 
of 
the United Nations, with the help of the Russian Federation and 
with the participation of the CSCE, will function. This body 
together with the directorate and the Georgian Government will 
work out and implement a program for Abkhazia's economic revival. 
  There are three options in deploying peacekeeping forces in 
Abkhazia. I shall give you three options and maybe we should 
choose one of them -- maybe it will not be the best one: 
  1. sending in multinational peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia 
under the auspices of the United Nations; in principle, nearly 
every member of the Security Council has agreed on this. 
  2. sending in Russian troops to the zone of conflict 
under the UN banner. Granting a UN banner is a bit problematic 
and not every country may agree on it. 
  3. deployment of Russian troops on the basis of bilateral 
negotiations and under UN supervision. 
  These are the three options. In two or three weeks time, we 
shall see which option we will have to deal with. The choosing 
will be up to the Security Council. [passage omitted] 
  The role of Georgians and Abkhazians in resolving the Abkhaz 
conflict should grow. We must care for the refugees and those 
forcibly displaced and protect their human rights and alleviate 
their hardship. 
  It is necessary to curb the activities of the mercenaries of 
the mountain people of the Transcaucasus. They ae forming an 
alliance with the richest fundamentalists, reactionary 
fundamentalists, [word indistinct] fascism, and others. It is 
necessary to have constructive relations with Russia's new 
parliament. Such relations have started, and the first steps 
have already been taken. It is necessary that we work out 
rational, cautious but effective tactics and strategy for action 
in this direction. 
  Historical lessons on resolving conflicts, Russo-Georgian 
relations against this background, and their positive and 
negative results give us grounds for a serious discussion and 
for seeking a way out of the crisis. 
  I think that the resolution of the Georgian-Ossetian 
conflict 
is entering a new, more advantageous phase, and it is necessary 
to intensify this process. 
  A deep analysis must be made of the situation in the area 
chiefly populated by the Azeris in Georgia's regions. 
  We must not ignore any corner and any nationality or ethnic 
minority. The situation must be critically assessed and 
realistic measures carried out to make up for previous mistakes. 
Very serious mistakes have been made in these regions. Go and 
see, listen and you will realize how barbaric the methods 
carried out by Georgian authorities sometimes used to be. It is 
inadmissible in a normal and civilized country. 
  The situation in the regions of Georgia mainly populated by 
Armenians and Greeks must be studied in detail. Measures must 
be taken for strengthening friendship between peoples. We must 
reinforce the representation of ethnic minorities in the 
authorities. It is necessary. 
  The Georgian state gives a full guarantee to the Russians, 
Ukrainians, Azeris, Armenians, Greeks, Abkhazians, Ossetians, 
Jews, Kurds, Assyrians, and all other nationalities living in 
Georgia that their national interests will be constitutionally 
secured, and it is one of the basic principles and regulations 
of the Union of Citizens of Georgia. 
  Radical changes must be carried out in the activities of 
law- 
enforcement bodies. The constitution and laws must facilitate 
the perfection of the system of law-enforcement bodies. First 
of all, the independence of law-enforcement bodies is necessary. 
They must be subjected only to the constitution and law, and on 
this basis, the legitimate authorities. 
  Radical reforms must take place in the Interior Ministry, 
in the procurator's office, and in court. The battle against 
the political-economic-social mafia, corruption, 
black-marketeering, narcotics, racketeering, bribery, and 
extortion must be stepped up. 
  Investigatory bodies must be separated from all departments 
and a separate investigatory committee subject to the government 
must be established. This will happen at a later stage. 
Reforms must be carried out in the system of serving sentences. 
This is also a serious issue. 
  The role of the Bar should be raised. On the basis of 
reinforcing the public order, an advantageous legal space must 
be created for businesses and investments and for creating a 
free economic zone on the territory of all-Georgia. [passage 
omitted: legal business must be supported; the rule of law is 
necessary for setting up businesses in Georgia; police and 
judicial staff should be trained abroad; the union will actively 
participate in restoring law and order] 
  A few words about the mass media. Reforms in the mass media 
are necessary. Georgia must become integrated in the world 
information and communication network. The law on the press 
must be put into effect even more effectively. The 
professionalism of the press, and of radio and television staff 
must be raised. [passage omitted: freedom of the press is a 
reflection of the level of society's culture; the union thinks 
the state must facilitate development of the press and 
television] 
  As long as the state subsidizes the press, radio, 
television, 
or a news agency, it has the right to demand of them that they 
report objectively on state policy and when commissioning 
programs. Cooperation between the press and the authorities must 
be constructive. We must also facilitate setting up an 
opposition press. We must help that press as well. We must 
embrace this culture. And then we shall overcome the malady of 
slander which we find in some papers which put all of us off 
because they are unqualified and unprofessional. The union of 
citizens of Georgia must take care of the opposition and of the 
opposition press as well. [passage omitted: it is necessary to 
sell competitive information in the world information market; 
defend interests of the Georgian people; the coordinating bureau 
set up at the office of head of state has a serious mission to 
carry out; carrying out economic and social programs are 
important for implementing political programs] 
  Once again, I would like to tell you that the main ideas for 
political, economic, and social reform were voiced in our 
previous electoral platform, in the report which was read out at 
the Academy of Sciences. [passage omitted: Shevardnadze says he 
is often wrongly reprimanded for not having a program and says 
that opponents should read the papers; the ideas of these 
reforms were approved of by people] 
  Some ideas about the reforms in the social and economic 
sphere: 90 percent of the population of Georgia is living below 
the poverty line; the vast majority of the population is 
starving; there have been instances of death through starvation; 
there is a catastrophic disparity between living standards, 
prices, and wages. [passage omitted: inflation is rocketing up; 
the number of forcibly displaced people is growing; the coupon 
is falling; measures taken by the cabinet of ministers have 
yielded no results so far; the union aims to take Georgia out of 
the deep economic crisis and improve the standard of living] 
  An anticrisis program has been submitted to the Georgian 
parliament. Main provisions of the program have been discussed 
by the union of citizens of Georgia at different levels. It will 
be desirable if every member of the union and every citizen of 
Georgia knows what these documents say. These documents must be 
dispatched to rayons and towns. These documents constitute 
quite a serious basis for a constructive dialogue with every 
party and with the population in general. 
  Both main trends in the long-term strategic development and 
immediate measures that need to be taken have been discussed in 
these state and government documents. The Republic of Georgia's 
anticrisis program consists of three main aspects: conceptual, 
forecasting, and regulatory measures for the economy; and about 
100 state programs. In view of the present critical situation, 
the program will be renewed quarterly. 
  In accordance with these two main documents, on the 
instruction of the head of state, and on the basis of a decree 
by the cabinet of minsters, an anticrisis program will be 
prepared by every ministry and administration of every region. 
Please, see that this work is carried out. 
  I will touch only on some of the key issues of the national 
program and the aims of the union of citizens of Georgia. 
  Analysis shows that the current crisis in Georgia is of a 
structural and systematic nature and is embracing every circle 
and part of the economy. The crisis has exacerbated Georgia's 
socio-economic backwardness. The union of citizens of Georgia 
considers that the shortest and the most effective way of 
extricating Georgia from the crisis is to restore and develop 
economic links with the CIS countries. Those who voted against 
Georgia joining the CIS do not comprehend the reality of 
Georgia's present predicament and misunderstand those people 
living in dire poverty, whose feelings they are going to 
manipulate and whom they are trying to force into the streets. 
It will not work. [passage omitted about the importance of 
retaining the CIS market] 
  The main existing funds must be renewed and modernized, 
otherwise they will become physically extinct. We cannot carry 
out renewal and modernization without links with these CIS 
countries. In the immediate four or five years we have no other 
options. 
  It is inadmissible to transfer to a free economy without 
management. It is necessary to manage and regulate the economy 
according to market principles. 
  The main priorities for Georgia's social and economic 
development in the short and medium-term are: to overcome the 
crisis and rebuild the destroyed economy as quickly as possible; 
to speed up the transfer to a market economy; to carry out the 
necessary structural changes by means of speeding up the 
development of medium and big business; to supply vital spheres 
of the economy with power by economizing in consumption and 
increasing domestic power production; [words indistinct]. 
[passage omitted: the program for Georgia's power development 
must be discussed separately by the newly elected council; 
people should know where we stand and what the solutions for 
emerging from this crisis are; the transport system must be 
developed; the export network must grow] 
  We can manufacture products for export if factories start to 
work and people get down to work. Goods for export can be 
produced and foreign currency reserves can be created. 
  A market economy is the first mechanism for overcoming the 
crisis and for the formation of an independent economy. In the 
meantime, we must take into consideration the fact that reforms 
must be carried out systematically and not in segments. 
  By the year 2000 we must go through three stages of 
development. The main aim in the social sphere is to keep the 
population alive and avoid a social explosion. At the second 
stage, we must gradually restore a precrisis standard of 
consumption by the population. At the third stage, we must 
achieve the standard of living of a developed country and 
establish a socially oriented market economy. [passage omitted: 
Shevardnadze thinks a program which envisages the maximum 
development of the economy is best] 
  We will restore the partnership with the CIS countries. I do 
not doubt it. Therefore, we will orientate toward the second 
variant of the program which means that by 1994, that is in the 
current year, there must be a 50 percent growth in the products 
produced inside the country compared with 1993. In 1995 the 
figure must be above 100 percent. These are realistic aims. It 
is not a lot but it will help us get our breath back. 
  I know that I shall be told that Shevardnadze addressed the 
congress of the Union of Citizens of Georgia like a secretary of 
the Communist Party -- like he used to address old congresses. 
I am telling you that no union and party is going to be viable 
without it. The union and a political movement must be wherever 
a man's fate is decided. 
  The expected growth of industry will create advantageous 
circumstances for achieving micro-economic stabilization, but 
the monetary and credit situation still remains complex due to 
the high prices of the imported raw materials. 
  Georgia's foreign debts are growing fast. We have not felt 
it yet, but in two or three years it will become a serious issue 
for Georgia. Now we are rejoicing at the European Union's 
granting us 70 million Ecu [European currency units] in the 
beginning, and then 40 million Ecu, and now it promises to allot 
20 million Ecu and so on -- all this has to be paid back. These 
debts will grow. Many of these debts will be forgiven, 
probably. Some skeptics are saying that the Union will not be 
able to take what we shall not have, but it will stop giving us 
loans as it will have no incentive [passage indistinct]. 
  A major migration of people in search for work abroad is to 
be expected. We must study this process seriously and regulate 
this process, as is done in other countries. [passage omitted: 
Shevardnadze talks about the growth of privatization; he says 
privatization will grow in 1994-95; joint-stock societies and 
investment funds will be established] 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia is proud that among its 
members are industrialists, businessmen, bankers, financiers, 
managers and thousands of representatives of a new social 
strata. The Union of Citizens of Georgia in the meantime is a 
political party and a political movement for representatives of 
big, medium, and small businesses. Establishing the market 
economy is one of its aims. [passage omitted -- Shevardnadze 
says the market economy will help overcome poverty] 
  It is necessary to resolve the issue of legalizing the 
hidden 
privatization wherever possible. We must not pass a vote of no 
confidence in the corps of managers, heads, and specialists, 
provided they can secure high standard of production and improve 
the living conditions of workers. They must participate in the 
process of privatization and become owners. Then, they will 
care more about high standards of production. In the meantime, 
the Union of Citizens of Georgia is also a party and a political 
movement for agrarian reforms. It is good that this issue was 
thoroughly discussed in the commission. The anti-crisis 
program envisions a 50 percent growth in agricultural products 
in 1994; it is problematic but we must achieve it. [passage 
omitted -- Shevardnadze says private sector will grow] 
  As of 1994, major structural changes are to be envisioned in 
agricultural industry through developing the potato, beetroot, 
and cattle industries. Positive moves in agriculture are 
connected with the further development of the food and 
processing industry. This branch has been plundered. In the 
immediate future you shall have a chance to look at figures as 
to what has been smuggled out of Georgia over the last four to 
five years. Anything that could be smuggled from these branches 
has been smuggled, but nothing has been imported in return. This 
is the lawlessness and anarchy that reigned there. We must put 
an end to it and take care of these branches. [passage omitted 
-- those who are making most noise now are the culprits of 
these] It is envisioned that in 1994, the industries of tinned 
food, wine products, tea, mineral waters, meat products, and 
milk will develop quickly; as a result of the privatization and 
floatation of the food industry, enterprises and the private 
sector in this branch will grow up to 30 to 35 percent by 1995. 
  Work is finishing on programs, which are to be called land, 
bread and foodstuffs, in accordance with different branches. 
The Union of Citizens of Georgia unites peasants, farmers, 
members of agriculture and the processing industry, and 
representatives of the agricultural business; therefore, the aim 
of the union is to work out and implement the fundamental 
programs of the agrarian and industrial complex. [passage 
omitted -- Shevardnadze says building organizations must be 
privatized; gives a list of enterprises which have to be 
privatized] The committee for building and architecture has 
worked out programs which in principle meet our demands. 
Despite the acute financial crisis, it has been envisioned 
that the communications network will develop, and first of all, 
those networks that have been damaged as a result of terrorist 
acts or natural forces will be restored. There are good 
prospects in cooperation in this field with foreign countries. 
Siemens is coming to Georgia. An appropriate tender has taken 
place here, and influential businessmen who undertook the 
development of the communications network are coming to Georgia. 
This cooperation will be based on the principle of partnership. 
The development of every kind of transport has been 
envisioned. Especially important are the plans worked out by the 
railway, naval, air, and automobile transport departments. 
Railway transport deserves a particular attention. We must 
restore railways, put it in order; as well as underground and 
other means of communications. 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia pays a great deal of 
attention to the issues of ecology, and the national and world 
movements of the Greens. The Ministry of the Environment has 
created a program for avoiding the ecological catastrophe. 
Please, I appeal to all parties, our colleagues and, of course, 
the Union of Citizens of Georgia, while there still is time, 
while our nature and climate still exists, let us take care of 
it. Forests have been extinguished. However hungry we may be, 
we must take care of the forest and nature, as generations will 
not be able to restore what we shall destroy today. Let us turn 
to these issues. 
  We must also take an active part in carrying out such 
programs as trade and supplies, as well as others. It is 
expected that prices will start to become relatively stable as 
of the second half of 1994; it is expected. A realistic 
demand-supply market mechanism and raising [words indistinct] 
will facilitate it. The Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that 
stepping up of management of economy is of a particularly great 
importance. It means an organic merging of state and market 
mechanisms. The following emergency measures must be carried 
out. 
  Somebody has written me a note, let me see what it says. 
They are the questions. I shall answer them in the end. I 
thought that they wrote to me to stop talking [laughter]. The 
Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that stepping up of managing 
economy is of a particularly great importance today. In this 
connection, here are some principles: 
  -- Carrying out the emergency economic situation on the 
whole 
of the Georgian territory; 
  -- Reaching an agreement between the existing parties. I 
appeal to our partners, other parties, their leaders and members 
to achieve an agreement on a political moratorium. [passage 
omitted -- Shevardnadze says that destabilization must not be 
allowed and that reforms must be carried out under normal 
political and economic conditions] 
  -- Reinforcing the state and executive discipline in all 
spheres of economy; 
  -- Selling the products made in state enterprises at freed 
prices in state trade network. I think that this process about 
which I have talked for a long time must be restored - free 
prices and a simultaneous pay rise. We cannot avoid it. 
Considering the current situation, we cannot come out of the 
crisis; therefore, I am asking relevant departments to study 
this issue in detail. [passage omitted -- union thinks the 
unprotected layers of society must be personally helped] 
  -- Improvement of state subsidies for transport, 
education, health, science and culture. The contractual system 
must become the basis for carrying out a state program involving 
the state and agriculture. The market mechanism which would 
give an incentive to an agriculture worker, must be set up. 
  -- The production of grain, stock-raising and combined 
fodder must become a priority; we must use every means and every 
possibility. The Introduction of barter trade as part of a 
contractual system can be allowed. 
  One of the main aims for the union is to overcome the 
hyperinflation, and the currency must be stabilized. The main 
constituent elements of the state's anti-inflation program are: 
  -- Measures for financial stabilization; 
  -- The maximum cut of the budget deficit; 
  -- Overcoming structural disproportions; 
  -- Supplying the commodities market with the basics; 
  -- Reorganizing the import-export structure and 
establishing order in this field. 
  The most significant issue which the economy is facing is 
the 
issue of the national currency. It is a sensitive issue for 
every family. [passage omitted -- the coupon must prepare 
economic conditions for transition to a monetary unit] 
  Before the economy is revived, strict selection money and 
credit policy must be carried out. The coupon's full-scale 
circulation must be secured. The volume of production must 
grow. The mechanisms of payment by check must be put in action. 
Cash and non- cash payments must develop. [passage omitted -- 
Shevardnadze talks about the measures needed for creation of the 
basis for the Georgian national currency; says everything will 
be done to get credits from abroad which would help strengthen 
the national currency] 
  The Union of Citizens of Georgia thinks that Georgia's entry 
in the ruble zone needs serious studying. Let us not hurry 
about it. It needs serious -- very serious -- studying. 
Conclusions made in haste will be no good to us. We must judge 
taking into consideration our own possibilities and foreign 
relations. A state program -- Georgia's Economy and the Ruble 
and the Dollar Zone -- must be worked out; as well as its 
prospects. Everything must be published and all our population 
must discuss these issues. [passage omitted -- Shevardnadze says 
the state system of regulating the economy must be set up; to 
this end state programs must be used; about 100 programs exist 
and 12 such programs have been tested in the United States and 
were approved there, and as a result partners have appeared] 
  An end must be put to the simplistic attitude towards 
comprehending the market economy. It was a wide-spread belief 
before that the market economy must develop spontaneously. It 
shall never happen. The regulating role of the state in the 
countries with market economies is secured and guaranteed, and 
the state always has whatever it needs for keeping the 
population alive, for its welfare, etcetera. 
  The economic emergency situation means operational and 
perfect implementation of economic measures of regulation, and 
in particular, the head of state and the cabinet of ministers 
must retain the right to adopt decrees without the preliminary 
publication and discussion in parliament of drafts and other 
legislative documents and resolutions. 
  The head of state must be granted the right to temporarily 
stop legislative acts in the economic field -- temporarily. It 
is necessary to save the economy and people from catastrophe, 
and is in accordance with national interests. 
  These measures are necessary for saving democracy and the 
market economy from chaos and anarchy. [passage omitted -- 
economic reforms and privatization must be speeded up] 
  1994 must become the decisive year for our fight against the 
crisis, anarchy, chaos and destabilization. 
  With the aim of overcoming the crisis, temporary emergency 
measures must be carried out operationally in 1994; among them 
are: 
  -- State credits in the first half of 1994 must be given 
only 
for importing foodstuffs, fuel and medicine; 
  -- A strict economic and legislative responsibility must 
be set up for the effective use of means; 
  -- Bread, sugar, and other foodstuffs must be secured for 
the population; 
  -- A centralized and fixed distribution of 
fuel and energy resources to the population must be established. 
[passage omitted -- contracts must be drawn with peasants and 
agricultural enterprises] 
  It is expedient to contract the state capital investments 
only for vitally important commodities -- foodstuffs, power, and 
engineering. Those enterprises which are not competitive and 
produce no raw materials and which cannot be privatized and 
cannot be put on flotation, must be given free to foreign firms 
should they want it. Do not let it frighten us. Georgia will 
not be sold or impoverished by it. [passage omitted -- monetary 
reforms are necessary; the coupon must be reinforced and foreign 
currency temporarily used] 
  It is of a major importance that the Finance Ministry and 
the 
national bank of Georgia in time finish work on programs of the 
bank and finance reforms. We are lagging behind, terribly 
lagging behind, and it is impossible to revive the economy 
without the improved bank and finance systems. [passage omitted 
-- interest on bank deposits must grow; a permanent state 
commission for working out and implementing monetary and credit 
policy must be established] 
  There are arguments here alleging that we were interfering 
with the independence of the national bank. I still think that 
that independence cost us very dear. There must exist a strong 
state formation which would control credits; because it is 
impossible to stop giving credits and stop life from flowing. 
It is impossible for parliament to control each sum given out 
by the national bank. That is why such a commission must be 
established. 
  A state program for reinforcing the coupon and the national 
currency must be established. 
  It is expedient to perfect the mechanisms for the social 
protection of the population living under the conditions of 
growing prices and tariffs, and use granted credits with a 
concrete aim. [passage omitted -- the unemployed, refugees and 
the forcibly removed must be helped; order must be established 
in distributing humanitarian aid; more aid is to come; if 
Western allies see that the aid is going to wrong places, then 
these channels will be blocked off] 
  It is necessary to speed up working out and implementing 
the price model -- which is characteristic for the market 
economy countries -- and creating the agricultural raw materials 
and products in the republic. A scientific center which would 
study prices and the economic situation must be set up. 
  The speed of carrying out the strategic and tactical aims, 
suggested by the economic and social development and their 
scale, will depend on using Georgia's internal potential, as 
well as on the nature of the international political and 
economic situation in which Georgia's economy will have to 
function in the immediate future. There are such possibilities. 
[passage omitted -- Georgia has a potential to produce 
competitive products for the world market; Georgia's 
geo-political situation can help Georgia's economy; Georgia may 
become a crossroad from Europe to Asia; Georgia get a foothold 
into the Russian market; Georgian national products must take 
root in the Russian market before others do and withstand the 
competition; Georgia is rich in waters] 
  Many people say that in five, six, or seven years the 
drinking water may cost more than petrol. We have these water 
resources, let alone mineral water. 
  True, Georgia today has no useful ores, which, according to 
the world market would be especially large, but Georgia can make 
its contribution in economic development for utilization and 
recovery of manganite, arsenic, ferrous metals [words 
indistinct] and other existing deposits using modern technology. 
[passage omitted: Georgia is rich in hydro resources] 
  If we take into consideration how many hydro resources are 
available per square kilometer, Georgia comes first in the 
world. Our country has these resources. We can be talking here 
about big and small hydro-electric stations. In two or three 
years we can achieve great results together with Western firms 
which are showing a big interest in it. 
  Simultaneously, oil deposits must be discovered. Without 
fail, Georgia has oil. I am sure that there is oil and gas in 
Georgia. One of the pieces of advice from James Baker was that 
he gave us names of two more companies besides the ones he was 
here with; we can trust these companies and they will give us a 
guarantee that in the immediate future we may discover oil 
deposits. [passage omitted -- talks about Iceland which exists 
on thermal energy; Georgia also has inexhaustible thermal 
deposits which are not used] 
  The main factor in the development of Georgia's economy are 
working resources and working forces which, more or less, know 
the modern technology of industry and have a knack to learn the 
most complex technological processes. 
  Georgia's gradual political and economic integration with 
the 
democratic world is a factor for Georgia's economic development, 
as well as the humanitarian and economic aid of the developed 
Western countries, and the realization of the programs of the 
IMF, the World Bank, and other international economic 
organizations. 
  As I have said, our meetings in Washington are 
hope-inspiring. Not only did we get the support of the World 
Bank and the IMF, but also the promise of support from those 
countries which have a decisive voice in the world's financial 
organizations, and, in particular, the United States and other 
countries. 
  In order to realize these reserves we must envision general 
tendencies for the social and economic development.
