  [Text] The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission expects 
to hold the second round of parliamentary elections on 9 and 10 
April. This was reported to the press by the commission chairman 
Ivan Yemets. 
  However, "several district commissions suggest holding the 
second round already this week, on 2 April." In these 
circumstances the Central Commission is not going to insist on 
its opinion, Yemets said. Moreover, district commissions will 
have a chance to hold elections at a time suitable for them. 
  "They will be free to organize voting this weekend or the 
next, but 10 April is the latest possible date under the law," 
the official said. 
  According to preliminary reports from district commissions, 
47 out of 450 members of the new parliament were elected in the 
first round. Thus, a second round of voting will be held in 403 
electoral districts. 
  Fourteen of the elected members of parliament are Socialists 
and Communists. They were elected mostly in Donetsk, Lugansk 
and other eastern regions. 
  Thirteen members from Western Ukraine belong to 
national-democratic organizations. 
  There are also two members of the radical Ukrainian National 
Assembly.

  [Text] The leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement 
Rukh, Vyacheslav Chernovil, described the results of the first 
round of parliamentary elections in Ukraine as a success for 
democratic forces. At a news conference in Kiev Monday, he 
pointed out that candidates of Rukh and the democratic bloc had 
been either elected or passed on to the second round of the 
elections in most constituencies of the Republic. 
  "There is hope that the new Supreme Soviet will be better 
and 
it will be possible to structure it by creating factions and 
blocs," Chernovil said. He pointed out that these elections 
were more free and democratic than before. However, numerous 
violations which influenced the electors' choice in favor of the 
ruling party had been revealed, according to Chernovil. 
  "Rukh will react calmly to any change in the timing of 
Ukrainian presidential elections," Chernovil was quoted as 
saying. He added that it was ridiculous to elect the head of 
the state without defining his legislative powers beforehand. 
However, Rukh insists that the election day must be set exactly 
so that either the old, or the new parliament could pass the 
necessary laws. At the same time, Chernovil spoke against 
granting the Ukrainian president extra powers. 
  The Rukh leader believes that the results of the opinion 
polls in the Donets Basin and the Crimea will have no legal 
force. "If the leaders of the state hold firm and stick to the 
law, everything will take its course as it should in a 
democratic country," he said.

  [Text] Simferopol -- According to preliminary information, 
the greatest number of deputies' seats at the elections to the 
Crimean Supreme Council held 27 March were won by the "Rossiya" 
bloc of parties. The Communist Party of Crimea was in second 
place, and the Party for the Economic Revival of Crimea came 
third. Around 59 percent of the 1.8 million voters took part in 
the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Musiyenko: "Crimea: `Russia' Bloc in </F>
Lead"] 
  [Text] Elections of deputies of the parliament of Crimea 
were validly held in this peninsular Republic on Sunday. I was 
told at the Central Electoral Commission that 1,873,805 people 
-- 58.83 percent of those included on the lists -- participated 
in the voting. According to preliminary data, candidates for the 
"Russia" bloc are leading in single-seat districts. The bloc's 
nominee, incidentally, is Yuriy Meshkov, Crimea's current 
president. Representatives of the Crimean Communist Party are in 
second place. 
  Regarding the elections to the Ukrainian Supreme Council, 
also announced for 27 March, it is too soon to speak even of 
their preliminary results. As of 1600 on that day, voting 
papers had been issued to 52 percent of Crimea's citizens. This 
certainly does not mean, however, that they all ended up inside 
the ballot boxes: On the eve of the elections many Crimean 
parties and movements were actively encouraging their supporters 
to obtain voting papers but not to take them away rather than 
casting them. 
  On Yuriy Meshkov's initiative a poll of Crimeans on their 
attitude toward a treaty basis in relations between the Republic 
of Crimea and Ukraine, dual citizenship, and imparting the force 
of law to a number of Crimean presidential edicts was held 
simultaneously with the parliamentary elections. As is known, 
the idea of such a poll elicited a highly negative reaction from 
the Kiev authorities, being deemed by them to run counter to the 
Ukrainian Constitution. Therefore, the Crimean Central Electoral 
Commission was not involved in organizing the poll. Nor is it 
involved in counting the votes -- presidential power structures 
have taken on the fulfillment of this task. I have learned that 
the majority of those who came to vote replied in the 
affirmative to the questions put to them, thereby voicing 
confidence in the president's program for extricating the 
Republic from the crisis.

IZVESTIYA: "Elections to Ukrainian Parliament Successful. Main 
Contenders for Presidential Post Have Become Deputies"] 
  [Text] Kiev -- Ukraine has made its choice. The elections 
were invalid in only three electoral districts out of 450. 
There was a record result -- a 92-percent turnout -- in 
Ivano-Frankovsk Oblast, and there was a 70-percent turnout in 
the western oblasts in general. Over 60 percent of voters 
turned up at the polling places in Donetsk, Kharkov, Zaporozhye, 
and Odessa Oblasts. 
  From what Peter Emery, head of a CSCE delegation, who had 
been on duty at one of Kiev's polling places, said, "the 
elections were sufficiently honest and democratic." 
  As for the second round -- and, according to predictions, no 
more than 70 candidates will get into parliament at the first 
attempt -- Ivan Plyushch, head of the current Supreme Council, 
promised that this will be held no later than 10 April, and that 
the Central Electoral Commission may possibly schedule a repeat 
vote for next Sunday. 
  Incidentally, according to an INTERFAX report, Plyushch 
himself has already become a deputy, having collected over 60 
percent of the votes in his district. Rukh leader Vyacheslav 
Chornovil had the same lead. Among the candidates [former 
Ukrainian Premier] Leonid Kuchma obtained the greatest number of 
votes -- over 91 percent of those who voted (there was a 
96-percent turnout in Novgorod-Severskiy district). I. 
Yukhnovskiy, V. Pinzenik, S. Khmara, L. Tanyuk, and V. Lanovoy 
became deputies at the first attempt. For their part, Acting 
Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy, Supreme Council Deputy Chairman 
V. Durdinets, and Socialist Party Head A. Moroz will continue 
their fight in the second round. 
  According to Chornovil, none of the political forces will 
win 
the current elections -- the nonparty nomenklatura will make its 
presence felt. "I am beginning to believe in the existence of 
Kravchuk's legendary list," the Rukh leader said. "In 
practically every district there are representatives of the 
party in power: All the vice prime ministers, many ministers, 
presidential representatives, and heads of local administrations 
have been running in the elections, and even the democrats 
`affiliated to power' are fighting the opposition democrats in 
the districts."

  [Text] Kiev 29 Mar, TASS -- The final results of elections 
to the Ukrainian parliament will be announced at a news 
conference of the Central Electoral Committee on Tuesday. 
  The elections held last Sunday have been found valid in all 
the 450 one-seat districts, although in the run-up to the 
elections, many politicians, including President Kravchuk, have 
not been sure of sufficient voter turnout. 
  Some 75 per cent of voters on an everage have cast their 
ballots, according to preliminary returns. Voter turnout in 
Kiev was considerably less, approximately 56 per cent of the 
eligible voters. There was the highest voter turnout in Western 
regions, where, as expected, candidates from nationalist forces 
won. 
  There is a different picture in eastern Ukraine. In the 
Donetsk and the Lugansk regions, out of the 14 deputies who won 
in the first round, eleven will represent the Communist Party of 
Ukraine in the Supreme Soviet. First secretary of the Centarl 
Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Petr Simonenko was 
also elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet. 
  Only a small part of the future deputies corps, some 70 
people have been elected to the Supreme Soviet on the first 
round, according to preliminary results. The date for the 
second round has not yet been fixed. Informed sources say, 
however, that it will be held not later than 10 April. 
  Most of those who have been elected to parliament in the 
first round are prominent politicians. Former premier Leonid 
Kutchma who favours stronger ties with Russia earned the biggest 
number of votes. Ninety-one per cent of voters in the district 
where he ran cast their ballots for him. The voter turnout in 
the Novgorod- Severskiy district where he ran was 96 per cent. 
Among those who have been elected to parlaiment are the present 
parliamentary speaker Ivan Plyushch, former deputy prime 
minister Viktor Pizenik, leader of extreme nationalists Stepan 
Khmara and other politicians prominent in Ukraine. 
  Foreign observers who monitored the election believe there 
have been no serious violations of democratic procedure.

  [Text] The democratic and well-organized nature of the 
elections to Ukraine's Supreme Council was emphasized by the 
delegation of observers from the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly 
during the news conference held in Kiev yesterday. Our 
correspondent Ihor Bak reports: 
  [Begin Bak recording] Members of this delegation which 
arrived in Ukraine on 24 March -- including well-known 
politicians from a number of European countries -- have had the 
opportunity to obtain information, so to speak, first hand, in 
particular from the head of the Supreme Council, the head of the 
Central Electoral Commission, representatives of political 
parties, etc. Members of the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly 
delegation visited Zhytomir, Lvov, Donetsk, and a number of 
other oblasts, in addition to Kiev. 
  On 27 March, that is, on the day of elections, the 
parliamentarians of foreign countries observed the progress of 
the elections in 80 constituencies, including those located in 
military units. Thus, having informed Ukrainian and foreign 
journalists of their conclusions, the foreign observers 
emphasized that the elections in Ukraine were held in accordance 
with Ukraine's law on the elections of Ukraine's people's 
deputies and with a high rate of citizen participation. They 
were gratified to note that the elections were held on an 
alternative basis [alternatyvna osnova]. However, at the same 
time, they stated that a great number of candidates for deputy 
seats in many constituencies caused serious troubles in the 
process of voting. Because of this, electors made mistakes 
during the voting, and a significant number of election ballots 
was found invalid. In spite of this, Peter Emery, head of the 
CSCE Parliamentary Assembly delegation, said during the news 
conference that we can state that the Ukrainian elections were 
democratic and successful. [end recording]

do their military service in the Crimea only. The acting prime 
minister of the Crimea, Anatoliy Franchuk, and Military 
Commissioner Oleksandr Volkov were authorized to implement the 
edict. In this connection, Volkov told our correspondent that 
he had received the edict in the evening of 23 March. Just like 
Ukraine's Defense Minister Radetskyy, with whom O. Volkov 
discussed the subject, he considers the edict absolutely 
unlawful. "We will act in conformity with Ukraine's 
legislation," stressed Volkov. "As before, 80 percent of the 
conscripts will serve outside the Crimea and 20 percent (those 
found unfit for health reasons and the Crimean Tatars) will 
serve in the Crimea."

  [Text] Talking to newsmen in Kiev on Saturday [26 March], 
Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan said the Defense 
Ministry instructed the Crimea's Military Commissar to reject 
the recent order on army drafts by Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov. Meshkov ruled that Crimean conscripts serve only on 
Crimean territory. 
  On Friday, Bizhan visited Sebastopol to meet with the 
command 
of the Ukrainian Navy and the Crimea's Military Commissar. 
  He denied the Crimean authorities the right to make 
decisions 
on drafts to the Ukrainian armed forces. But he said the order, 
by which the Ukrainian Defense Minister allowed up to 20 percent 
of the Crimean draftees to serve on the peninsula, remained in 
force and those who could motivate their desire to stay to serve 
in their home region, would be allowed to stay. 
  Also on Friday in Sebastopol Bizhan met with the Russian 
Navy's chief-of-staff Admiral Selivanov. According to Bizhan, 
several senior officers of the Russian Navy arrived in 
Sebastopol without coordinating that move with the Ukrainian 
leaders. 
  Addressing the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, Bizhan said 
his Ministry wanted to take stock of the Fleet's property and 
study all the angles of that problem before preparing an 
agreement on the transfer of the Fleet under Russian command in 
payment for the fuel debt Ukraine was running with Russia. 
Preparatory work could show, said Bizhan, it would make no 
sense for Ukraine to sign that kind of an agreement with Russia. 
On the other hand, Moscow saw the problem as practically 
settled and was willing to discuss in detail the transfer of the 
Black Sea Fleet under its command. 
  In Bizhan's view, Moscow was violating a number of earlier 
agreements. Russian symbols were used by the Fleet and the 
decision was disregarded that the Fleet's vessels be manned in 
equal proportion by Russian and Ukrainian sailors. 
  According to Bizhan, 810th Marine brigade, with base in 
Sebastopol, was manned exclusively by Russian citizens. If it 
was recognized as all-Russian, the brigade would have to be 
removed, without delay, from Ukrainian territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan </F>
Bizhan by unidentified reporter; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Reporter] Ivan Vasilyevych, you have just 
returned from the Crimea. The most acute problem facing your 
branch is the order issued by President of the Crimean Autonomy 
[as heard] Meshkov regarding the military service of Crimean 
residents on Crimean territory. What are your impressions and 
assessments of this development? 
  [Bizhan] Your question is right. Really, it is very 
important that such a question has been raised. This is why the 
[defense] minister resolved so forcefully and quickly to send a 
group to the Crimea headed by the deputy defense minister to 
immediately, so to say, examine the situation on the spot. 
  My impressions are the following. I am very glad that our 
military structures -- including the Crimea's military 
commissar, the military commissar of Sevastopol, the command of 
our Navy and Air Force, and the 32d Corps Command -- understand 
it in such a way as they should understand: This order is 
unlawful, has no underlaying legal basis, and is not subject to 
being obeyed. They will not obey it. That is to say, it is not 
necessary today to conduct work with this commanding structure 
to elucidate the position of the defense minister. Therefore, 
after my return, I was glad to report to the defense minister 
that we have conscious and aware people there -- they are 
Ukrainian citizens, real and true, and they will comply to 
Ukraine's laws and the instructions of our supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces and the defense minister. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Russian Gas Supplies Offset 80 Percent of Turkmenistan's </F>
Discontinued Gas Export to Ukraine" -- UKRINFORM headline; From 
the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 13, 21-27 Mar 94] 
  [Text] According to Ukrgazprom's sources, Russia's natural 
gas supplies to Ukraine during the 11-24 March period of 1994 
continued to exceed the amount, which was earlier agreed by the 
two parties. 
  Thus, factual natural gas supplies over the above period 
amounted to 2,445.2 million cu. m. [cubic meters] versus the 
expected figure of 1,606.8 million cu. m. 
  Turkmenistan's natural gas exports to Ukraine, which were 
stopped on February 22, have not been resumed, the negotiation 
process underway notwithstanding. Turkmenistan is reported as 
adamant in its decision not to resume its natural gas supplies 
to Ukraine before Ukraine has repaid its debt for Turkmen 
natural gas supplies in 1993. 
  Under the thus repudiated agreement the Central Asian nation 
was to supply 1,087.1 million cu. m. of natural gas to 
Ukrgazprom during the 11-24 March period. 
  As a result of an agreement, which the Ukrainian [word 
indistinct] reached with Russia's Gazprom joint-stock society on 
10 March, the Russian party undertook to supply additional 
natural gas to Ukraine in amounts sufficient to temporarily 
offset about 80 per cent of what Turkmenistan would have 
supplied to Ukraine, had it not discontinued natural gas exports 
to Ukraine. 
  The agreement will remain effective until 10 April, when 
Russia and Ukraine are supposed to hold talks about their 
account settling. Gazprom is reported to have laid down its 
terms, which the two [word indistinct] have refused to make 
public, though. It has been tipped off, however, that the 
Ukrainian party has been discussing not only a compromise 
decision, but also its likely having to accept the Russian 
party's terms, if the former variant proves impossible. 
  According to Ukrgazprom, the Russian party has been sticking 
to its temporary commitment almost fully and unswervingly having 
supplied additional 837.4 million cu. m. of natural gas 
between 11 and 24 March, which is about 77.2 per cent of the 
amount Ukraine was supposed to be supplied by Turkmenistan. 
  Ukraine's natural gas consumption over the same period was 
4,096.8 million cu. m. versus the expected figure 4,747.4 
million cu. m., according to Ukrgazprom, due both to the warmer 
weather conditions and more stringent fuel- and power saving 
moves by the government along with some enterprises having 
transferred to alternative fuels. 
  As spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for oil 
and 
gas maintain, despite these temporarily stabilized natural gas 
supplies to Ukraine, the overall situation remains rather 
precarious because of Ukraine's faulty and inefficient fuel 
clearance system and the fuel consumers' formidable domestic 
indebtedness. Moreover so, that the outcome of the 10 April 
talks with Russia is too hard to predict.

  [Text] Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Rybkin said that 
cooperation between the Russian and Kazakh parliaments should 
contribute to preservation of a single economic space. "We can 
encourage this process by lessening legislative differences," he 
told journalists on Monday after a meeting with Kazakh President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev in the Kremlin residence. 
  "We parliamentarians should prevent the legislations of our 
two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, from getting too different 
from each other, so that it would be difficult to unify them 
later," Rybkin pointed out. He expressed the opinion that 
"political approaches to closer cooperation, to cooperation on 
the basis of equal rights and mutual respect for the sovereignty 
of the two countries are not far away. But, let me repeat, the 
path to that lies through cooperation in the sphere of economy." 
This was the main issue of the conversation with Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, Rybkin said.

<F P=106> [Report by Igor Petrov and Sergey Karkhanin: "The Russian </F>
President Devoted His First Working Day After Returning From 
Vacation to Talks with the Kazakhstan Leader. Boris Yeltsin and 
Nursultan Nazarbayev Show the CIS Leaders How To Restore 
Economic Ties on a New Basis"] 
  [Text] The Russian-Kazakhstan talks in the Kremlin began 
with a one-on-one conversation between Boris Yeltsin and 
Nursultan Nazarbayev. The presidents were then joined by the 
two countries' state delegations, which include Premiers Viktor 
Chernomyrdin and Sergey Tereschenko. A large package of 
Russian-Kazakhstani agreements are expected to be signed as a 
result of the talks. 
  It is planned that Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev 
will sign a Treaty on Military Cooperation, a Treaty on the 
Further Deepening of Economic Cooperation and Integration 
Between Kazakhstan and Russia, a Treaty on the Basic Principles 
for Resolving Questions Linked with the Civil and Legal Status 
of Citizens of Kazakhstan Permanently Resident on Russian 
Territory and of Citizens of Russia Permanently Resident on 
Kazakhstan Territory, and an agreement between the two countries 
on the basic principles and conditions governing the utilization 
of the Baykonur space center. Around a score of documents 
relating to military and technical cooperation, the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energy, and cooperation in the fields of 
the economy, science, culture, and legal relations are expected 
to be signed at head of government level. A total of 22 
documents are scheduled to be signed as a result of the talks. 
  "The basis of our mutual relations is the treaty concluded 
in 
May 1992," Tair Mansurov, Kazakhstan ambassador extraordinary 
and plenipotentiary to Russia, said in a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
interview. "We are confident that our president's visit to 
Moscow will make it possible to add yet another fine page to the 
history of our peoples' friendship. Our common border is very 
nearly 6,000 km long, and 12 Russian and 6 Kazakhstani regions 
are located along it." 
  The ambassador recalled Nursultan Nazarbayev's remark that 
"the entire population of Kazakhstan is Russian-speaking," 
adding that the Kazakhstan leader regards relations with Russia 
as a priority. As for the Baykonur problem, about which there 
has been much argument recently, Tair Mansurov's view is that 
the space center must be preserved as an enormous achievement of 
scientific and technical thinking and it must operate in the 
interests of Russia and Kazakhstan alike. 
  Economic cooperation, which must be developed and deepened, 
remains the foundation of cooperation between the two countries. 
As the ambassador said, one of the documents prepared for the 
presidents' meeting relates precisely to economic relations. 
  On what basis can enterprises which used to be part of a 
unified technological chain but, by a whim of fate, have found 
themselves on adjacent territories, restore their severed ties? 
  Russian Government First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets is 
absolutely confident that transnational financial and industrial 
groups can and must become the new basis for this. In these 
groups the interests of allied enterprises are not national or 
-- even more so -- political but purely economic, since they are 
all "interlinked" through common finances to the production of 
the same finished output. The financial health of each 
individual enterprise will be totally dependent on the 
successful activity of the entire financial and industrial group 
as a whole. 
  The formation of the first Russian-Kazakhstan transnational 
financial and industrial group based on the "Omsknefteorgsintez" 
production association and 14 allied enterprises is currently on 
the agenda. It is typical that Kazakhstan's leaders were the 
first to realize the necessity and expediency of such a step and 
officially put a proposal to this effect to President Yeltsin. 
It is perfectly possible that one of the practical results of 
N. Nazarbayev's visit to Moscow will be precisely the signing of 
a special intergovernmental agreement on this. 
  However, the concentration of enterprises from the two 
countries around "Omsknefteorgsintez" is by no means the sole 
opportunity for building mutually advantageous cooperation. In 
O. Soskovets' view, joint work to modernize the Magnitogorsk 
Metallurgical Combine could be particularly promising and 
mutually advantageous. 
  This combine, which smelted around 20 percent of all Russian 
steel and exported 3 million tonnes a year, was traditionally 
geared to obtaining raw material from Kazakhstan. "What is the 
point of us bringing in pellets from the Lebedinskiy Mining and 
Enrichment Combine and spending 14,000-15,000 rubles [R] on 
shipping something priced at R12,000 a tonne of when we have 
appropriate Kazakh enterprises with empty order books right next 
door? Such cooperation could benefit everybody," the first vice 
premier believes. 
  Life itself is inexorably pushing our countries toward 
cooperation. And if the leaders of Russia and Kazakhstan manage 
to lay the political foundation for joint work, financial and 
industrial groups could indeed become the locomotive which will 
pull the two countries' economies out of crisis.

<F P=106> [Oleg Falichev article: "Russia-Kazakhstan: Military </F>
Cooperation Acquires Treaty Basis"] 
  [Text] The mass media have been devoting considerable 
attention to the subject of Russian-Kazakhstan relations and the 
talks process between the two republics. And now this process 
has reached summit level. Kazakhstan Republic President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev has arrived in Moscow on an official visit. 
What can we expect from his meeting with the Russian president? 
What interstate agreements do we hope will be signed? 
  One of the main points of the talks is linked with the fate 
of the Baykonur space center, which has very recently become a 
bone of contention between Russia and Kazakhstan. As is known, 
the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry 
attempted to "close" the matter through talks at their level. 
And a great deal was done during the preparatory period. But a 
definitive solution to the question was only found when the 
presidents met. Why? 
  It has turned out that recently relations between the two 
republics have not been developing in the best of ways. Or 
rather, not in the way people would like. Let us recall the 
differences of view over a unified ruble zone; the future 
operation of the Russian missile early warning station at 
Balkhash; Baykonur, which we have already mentioned.... On the 
one hand these contradictions are explicable. Kazakhstan is 
seeking to play a role in the world arena which is more 
autonomous and independent of Russia. And it has declared 
everything located on its territory to be its own property. But 
in terms of the Baykonur space center, let us recall that its 
status was defined by an intergovernmental agreement of 2 
October 1992. At that time Russia, in the shape of the Defense 
Ministry and the Russian Space Agency, committed itself to 
provide 94 percent of the funding of Baykonur and Leninsk. In 
1993 the Russian Federation spent 47 billion rubles on keeping 
these two facilities going. At a time when the Kazakhstan side 
was unable to ensure full and prompt payment of the other 6 
percent. 
  Today it is thanks to the Russian Military-Space Forces that 
the social sphere operates and spacecraft are launched. The 
world famous space facility is financially maintained by Russia. 
But do you want to know something interesting? While Russia 
was maintaining Baykonur, Kazakhstan was holding talks on how 
either the United States or Ukraine might be enticed to lease 
it. It was no coincidence that Alma-Ata [Almaty] started by 
saying that the 1992 agreement did not match Kazakhstan's 
interests. And then came the idea of creating a Baykonur-based 
international consortium in which no provision was made for 
advantages for Russia not only vis-a-vis the former republics of 
the USSR but even in terms of other space powers headed by the 
United States. Furthermore, according to an ITAR-TASS report, 
some kind of agreement on the joint use of Baykonur was signed 
during Nazarbayev's visit to the United States. Although the 
details are not being made public, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry's recent visit to Alma-Ata and Baykonur indirectly 
confirmed the two sides' definite joint interest. 
  As for Russia, it -- and others -- was eventually offered a 
lease on the space center, but on what were in fact unacceptable 
terms. In terms of both cost -- billions of dollars -- and the 
length of the lease. And although the positions of the sides 
changed several times in the course of the preliminary talks, a 
compromise on the main issue was not found until the last 
moment. Nevertheless Russia, as we were told at the press center 
of the Russian Federation Military-Space Forces, whose 
representatives have participated in the talks process at 
various times, is still ready to lease the Baykonur space 
center. But not on just any terms. 
  It is no surprise that as a result of the uncertainty which 
has been generated this unique ground complex with a developed 
infrastructure has found itself without an owner and is now in a 
sorry state. Some of the launch equipment is unusable, some 
things have simply been stolen. Lower-story apartment windows 
gape blindly.... 
  Nevertheless there has recently been perceptible movement in 
the Russian and Kazakhstani positions, facilitated by an active 
process of negotiation -- visits by a Russian Federation 
delegation to Kazakhstan and by a Kazakhstan delegation to 
Moscow. Nor is it possible to disregard the fact that the 
Baykonur problem comes into the context of the 
military-political and military cooperation treaty between 
Russia and Kazakhstan which is being prepared for signing. In 
the course of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to 
Kazakhstan mutual understanding was reached on Russia's 
utilization of some Baykonur facilities to implement 
defense-space programs taking account of Kazakhstan's interests. 
Including long-term programs, some of which are tied in to 
Russian accords with foreign countries and are geared to the 
utilization of precisely Baykonur. 
  The mid-march return visit to Moscow by a Kazakhstan state 
delegation headed by Premier Sergey Tereshchenko was also 
devoted to seeking compromise. On this occasion talks were held 
with members of Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's cabinet. 
The discussions covered military and military-technical 
cooperation. the utilization of the Baykonur space center, the 
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, and the deepening of 
relations in the field of the economy, science, culture, and 
law. That is, the precise questions which are scheduled for 
signing [as published] by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan 
Nazarbayev and which figure on the agenda for the planned 
meeting. 
  As for nuclear energy problems, the technological situation 
at the Mangistauskiy power plant in Kazakhstan is now extremely 
unfavorable: Nuclear scientists consider that keeping the 
BN-350 reactor at a safe level is problematical. Repair work 
and preventive maintenance have been cut back at this, 
Kazakhstan's only nuclear power station. And the republic 
cannot manage without Russia's help here, or in the future 
operation of Baykonur, or in the building of a Kazakhstan 
petroleum pipeline to the port of Novorossiysk, or on the 
implementation of many other projects. So Kazakhstan and Russia 
have a mutual interest in considered and mutually advantageous 
solutions in these areas. And likewise, incidentally, in the 
matter of creating a unified customs area, a free trade zone, an 
interstate bank.... And ultimately, maybe, in creating an 
economic union. 
  As this edition of the newspaper was being signed to press 
the final results of the meeting between the Russian and 
Kazakhstani presidents were still not known. It will take time 
to study and analyze the documents that have been signed.

Orenburg and Volga regions entitled "U.S Troops Have No Business 
on Our Soil," published under "Letter to People's Newspaper" 
rubric: "Totskiy Range Again"] 
  [Text] As reported in the press, Brigadier General Leonard 
Holder Jnr., commander of the U.S. 3d Infantry Division, has 
visited Totskiy Range in Orenburg Oblast to reconnoiter the 
tactical exercise scheduled for July 1994 involving U.S. and 
Russian Federation servicemen. General P. Grachev, Russian 
Federation defense minister, had also visited Volga Military 
District units a little earlier. 
  The following question arises: What kind of "peacekeeping" 
missions do the U.S. 3d Infantry and Russian 27th Divisions 
intend to solve jointly? 
  Bloody conflicts began on many republics' territories 
following the Soviet Union's disbandment. The Russian economy 
and the economies of other states formed on USSR territory ended 
up in a catastrophic situation. It is also alarming that the 
country's defense potential, created by the Soviet people's 
intensive labor, has been lost to a considerable extent. 
Meanwhile NATO countries headed by the United States are 
cynically flexing their military muscles. They launched missile 
and bomb attacks on the Iraqi people, they are issuing 
ultimatums to Cuba, the DPRK, and our fraternal Serbian people, 
they are shooting down aircraft in the Bosnian skies, and they 
are threatening to bomb Serb positions. 
  It is painful for working people of the Orenburg and Volga 
regions, like all Russians, to see the country's military and 
economic might and political authority declining in the course 
of reforms directed against the people. The increasing 
peremptoriness with which Western powers are openly interfering 
in Russia's internal affairs is a cause of anger and indignation 
to us. 
  The Orenburg region is turning into a kind of communal yard 
and a dumping ground for Western enterprises' harmful waste. 
Israeli, French, and Dutch enterprises have sent around 20 cars 
to the oblast loaded with industrial waste which is dangerous to 
people's health. While the authorities can reconcile themselves 
to such shameful phenomena, we have no intention of doing so. 
Sociopolitical organizations in the Orenburg and Volga regions 
strongly protest against the attempt to hold military exercises 
involving the U.S. Army in a strategically important region of 
Russia where the defense industry is densely concentrated and 
which is the people's breadbasket. We demand that the Russian 
Federation president and Government cancel the Defense 
Ministry's plans to hold exercises on southern Urals territory. 
We call on the State Duma to protect working people's 
fundamental interests and our oblasts' peaceful life. We call 
on all honest patriots in the Urals and Volga region republics 
and oblasts to raise their voices in defense of our country's 
sovereignty. U.S troops have no business on our soil!

the Russian Federation; Orenburg Oblast Committee of the Russian 
Communist Workers' Party; Orenburg Oblast organization of the 
Agrarian Party of Russia; Orenburg Oblast Council of Veterans;

  [Text] The American Congress has adopted an amendment to 
the draft budget for next year. It states that the USA will 
resist attempts by the Russian Federation to intimidate, to use 
military force, or economic pressure to create a sphere of 
influence in the former republics of the USSR and also in the 
countries of central and Eastern Europe. The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and the Ministry of Defense of Russia responded urgently 
to this decision today, by issuing a joint statement. It says 
that Russia is not setting its efforts against anyone at all and 
is not demanding special status or an exclusive role for itself.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Vanichkin] </F>
  [Text] Washington March 29 TASS -- The Russo-American 
relations are resting on a solid foundation, but their 
"honeymoon" is over. This is how some White House officials, who 
preferred to remain anonymous, have described the present state 
of relations between the two countries. They held a briefing 
for a group of Russian journalists on Monday. 
  The officials stressed that normal relations, and this is 
how, in their opinion, the current level of the 
Washington-Moscow dialogue can be described, do not exclude 
difficulties and problems. Moverover, the number of such 
problems and difficulties has lately increased. 
  Asked by ITAR-TASS about the reasons behind these 
difficulties, one of the White House officials said that he 
could only repeat what was already said in Moscow and Washington 
-- the "honeymoon" in American-Russian relations is over. This 
"honeymoon" began after the end of the "cold war", he stated, 
and America's assessments of Russia then differed sharply from 
its assessments of the Soviet Union. In his opinion America had 
then established excessively close relations with Russia which 
could not be kept up. Speaking about the end of the 
"honeymoon", the official said he was not referring to any 
crisis. Normal relations envisage differences too, he said. In 
solving its domestic political problems Russia is again 
beginning to play an active role on the world arena -- in Europe 
and the beyond its bounds. He said he believed some differences 
between the two countries were quite normal in these conditions. 
  It is an open secret that the results of the parliamentary 
elections in Russia were a surprise for the United States, 
another White House official said. The administration had 
closely followed the developments in Russia, but it did not 
foresee such an outcome, he added. The resignation of two main 
architects of the Russian reforms -- Yegor Gaydar and Boris 
Fedorov -- were a shock not only for many officials of the 
administration, but also for the congress, the press, and the 
American public at large. The official said that this shock was 
explained by the fact that America had cultivated its relations 
with Russia largely relying on the presence of reformers in the 
Russian Government. Analysing the latest events, the American 
side has arrived at the conclusion that strong American-Russian 
relations should be developed irrespective of personalities, on 
the basis of the mutual understanding of bilateral interests. 
The results of the parliamentary elections and of several events 
that have occurred lately on the international arena have, 
without doubt, increased differences in America's and Russia's 
approaches, but have not unsettled their bilateral relations.

  [Text] In the present political and military-strategic 
situation in the world Russia could refrain from joining the 
NATO program Partnership for Peace. However, Moscow would then 
sacrifice its partnership with NATO countries, lose initiative 
in military cooperation and remain an outsider to European 
processes. A high ranking official from the Russian Defence 
Ministry expressed this opinion to Interfax Monday. 
  He said the Russian leadership views the program as an 
intermediate stage in forming a new collective security system 
in Europe. He stressed that at the moment NATO is changing its 
policy of deterrence through intimidation towards Russia to 
deterrence through cooperation. 
  The official said that if Moscow joins the program it is 
going to press for a status in line with its significance in the 
world. The fact that Russia is a Eurasian nation should also be 
taken into account, making the CIS collective security treaty 
the most important matter. 
  He also named the main purposes of Russian participation in 
the program: 
  1. Active involvement in the formation of the new European 
collective security system based on equal rights and 
responsibilities of members. 
  2. The formation of an effective mechanism for preventing 
wars and conflicts that could serve as a prototype for the 
military structure of future European security. 
  3. The official recognition by NATO partners of the special 
responsibility of Russia for maintaining peace in the CIS. 
  4. The spreading of confidence-building measures to the 
military-technical sphere with the purpose of halting any new 
spirals of the arms race, a well-considered strategy of 
conversion. 
  The official told Interfax that none of the political or 
military leaders are thinking of Russian integration in NATO 
military structures. "We believe in the need for cooperation and 
interaction with the alliance in the interests of peace and the 
security of Europe and Russia", he said.

  [Text] Max van der Stoel, high commissioner for national 
minorities of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE), on Monday had a meeting in Moscow with Georgiy 
Satarov, aide to the Russian president. 
  A source in Satarov's office told Interfax the meeting had 
focused on the position of ethnic Russians in various former 
Soviet republics, such as the Baltic states, Ukraine and 
Kazakhstan. 
  Satarov said that, despite some obstacles, conditions had 
taken shape for solving these problems, because "the potential 
of political stability in the life of society has increased and 
good mutual understanding has been established between the 
Federal Assembly and the president, including on that problem." 
  During his three-day visit to Russia, van der Stoel, who 
arrived in Moscow on Monday, also plans to meet Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev, Minister of the Affairs of Nationalities and 
Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray, and the chairmen of the 
parliamentary commissions on human rights and international 
affairs, Sergey Kovalev and Vladimir Lukin.

  [Text] The first six of 35 maps of troops separation were 
signed in Zagreb by negotiators representing Croatia and the 
self-proclaimed republic of Serb Krajina in their second round 
of talks that started Tuesday. The Russian diplomat who broke 
this news to INTERFAX said, however, that "the talks are 
difficult and there is no telling when the remaining documents 
will be signed." 
  The talks which are underway in the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb 
center on a cease-fire and troops separation. Special envoys of 
the Russian and U.S. Presidents Vitaliy Churkin and Charles 
Redman are attending them as mediators as are officials of the 
UN and the International Peace Conference on Former Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpt] Rabat, 29 Mar -- The Algerian security forces 
have killed four armed men suspected of killing Konstantin 
Kukukshin, a driver employed at the Russian Federation Embassy. 
According to diplomatic sources, these men were also involved 
in the killing of high-ranking Algerian diplomat Belkacem Touati. 
  The details of the killing of the Russian representative are 
as yet unknown. The competent Algerian bodies are continuing 
their investigation of the circumstances of this act of 
terrorism. Local newspapers report that the Russian Embassy in 
Algiers has already received a number of threats from local 
Islamists belonging, it is suggested, to the underground "Armed 
Islamic Group." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Russia's Defense Minister Pavel Grachev started his 
official visit to Romania on Monday. He disclosed in an 
exclusive interview with Interfax at a Moscow airport before his 
departure that during the trip he would sign an agreement for 
military and technical cooperation between Russia and Romania 
covering a five year period. 
  In his words, this "framework" accord provides for exchanges 
of defense delegations, information and other types of contacts. 
  He reported plans to meet with Romania's president, premier, 
foreign and defence ministers. In his talks with Romanian 
politicians Grachev intends to discuss "the military and 
political aspects of bilateral cooperation and ways to ensure 
security in Europe." 
  He did not rule out that the situation in Moldova and 
Russia's military presence in Transdniestria would be looked at 
during the talks with the Romanian leadership. 
  On Russo-Kazakh military and technical contacts, Grachev 
revealed that "final touches are being put to the documents 
agreed to by the two presidents" and voiced hope that the 
accords would be signed by the two leaders in Moscow at 18:30 on 
Friday. 
  In his words, the most complex issue at the negotiations 
with 
the Kazakh leadership in Moscow is that of the use of the space 
center at Baykonur. "So far the issue has not been resolved in 
full," he remarked. 
  However, he noted that the issue on Kazakhstan's strategic 
nuclear forces had been settled once and for all. In his words, 
according to understandings on this matter, a time-table is to 
be drawn up within a month for moving nuclear ammunition out of 
Kazakhstan to Russia and for partial compensation to be paid by 
Moscow for the nuclear fuel. 
  Nor has there been any problem to withdraw nuclear warheads 
from Ukraine to Russia. As Grachev put it, "there have only 
been a few minor points of disagreement."

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Sergey Zheleznyak, including </F>
recorded comment by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev; from 
the "Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Zheleznyak] A guard of honor welcomed the Russian 
defence minister in Bucharest today. Pavel Grachev's visit is 
evoking special interest here. I will recall that it was 
postponed twice, the last time because of the broad anti-Russian 
campaign started by the opposition last December. The 
cancellation of the visit obviously disappointed the official 
authorities at the time. For more than two years our countries 
did not have any agreements on military cooperation. Bucharest 
does not hide the fact that it sees its security only under 
NATO's roof. Romania was the first to sign the Partnership for 
Peace Treaty with it. At the same time, despite all kinds of 
statements on its striving toward military cooperation with the 
West, Romania understands perfectly well that it cannot do 
without an accord on military cooperation with its most powerful 
neighbor in the east. Today, Pavel Grachev and Romanian Defense 
Minister Gheorghe Tinca discussed and signed such a document. 
  [Grachev] It is a comprehensive treaty that presupposes a 
resumption of the most normal relations with the sovereign state 
of Romania. 
  [Zheleznyak] Technical cooperation is of special interest to 
Romania. Its Army is equipped with artillery, tanks, aircraft, 
and other Soviet-made hardware. The country has no money to 
replace it, but spares and ammunition are needed to keep the 
military hardware in operational condition. The Russian defense 
minister plans to attend military exercises and meet the 
president and prime minister of Romania.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Aleksandr Krylovich] 
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- The Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs has advanced a new proposal aimed at achieving the 
earliest possible settlement of the situation on the Korean 
peninsula. Speaking at a news conference today, Russian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov announced that Russia is 
prepared, and regards it as expedient, to conduct "informal 
consultations" to prepare an international conference on this 
problem. The Russian Foreign Ministry last week put forward an 
initiative to hold such a conference with the participation of 
Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the DPRK, and the ROK, 
as well as representatives of the UN secretary general and the 
director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Aleksandr Panov noted that Russia's proposal is currently being 
closely studied by all interested parties, and none of them has 
so far responded to it negatively. 
  According to the Russian diplomat, consultations on 
preparations for an international conference could begin in 
Moscow in the near future. It is expected that each side could 
put forward its stand at these consultations. 
  A. Panov stressed that the Russian side starts from the 
premise that the conference, if it is held, should be thoroughly 
prepared. Issues for discussion must be drawn up taking account 
of the interests of both sides. In the view of the Russian 
diplomat, the problem of "how to ensure the nonnuclear status of 
the Korean peninsula" should be one of the foremost issues. The 
issue of confirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
both Korean states, maintaining noninterference in their 
internal affairs, and ensuring their freedom of choice of paths 
of social development should also be discussed. The Russian 
diplomat believes that a way out of the present situation can be 
found within the framework of such a multifaceted approach, 
which supplements steps that are already being taken. 
  A. Panov stressed that the Russian initiative has already 
played a positive part. In his view, "the furore over this 
problem has recently abated somewhat," and "an alternative that 
can be worked on" has emerged. 
  Touching on the issue of the venue for an international 
conference on the problem of the Korean peninsula, the Russian 
diplomat said that so far proposals have come in for it to begin 
work in Geneva, and then subsequently to be held by turns in 
Pyongyang and Seoul.

  [Text] The Russian Association of Koreans "Bomminren" has 
made a statement in connection with recent events concerning the 
Korean peninsula which, due to the United States, have assumed a 
dangerous character. 
  Just recently, the statement says, the public greeted with 
satisfaction the news of an agreement being reached on a 
comprehensive solution for the so-called Korean nuclear 
question. Then suddenly the alarming news broke that the 
American side, using its dominant position in the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, had broken off all these agreements and 
made blunt threats against the DPRK which were accompanied by a 
stream of lies and slander aimed at North Korea. By so doing 
the United States and its allies revealed their true plans: 
Using the situation which had developed, they planned to 
slander and strangle the socialist state on Korean soil and 
prevent Korea's peaceful unification. 
  The Russian association "Bomminren" resolutely condemns the 
Americans' plans. On behalf of the many thousands of Koreans 
living in various countries outside of Korea it demands that the 
row and provocation connected with the so-called nuclear 
question on the Korean peninsula be stopped.

<F P=106> [Andrey Krushinskiy report under "Asian Crossroads" rubric: </F>
"Third Front in the Pacific?"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- Until recently the political barometer 
of the Pacific region, unlike in mother Europe with its "NATO 
umbrella," indicated "fine." But then the atmosphere here too 
clouded over thanks to the Washington leaders of the "civilized 
society," who contrived to start a quarrel with both China and 
Japan at once. Now Clinton's "third front" in the Pacific is 
becoming apparent -- the DPRK. 
  It is a small state in terms of its potential and cannot, of 
course, be compared with the two aforementioned very influential 
Asian and world powers but, on the other hand, the acuteness of 
the conflict here is far greater: Whereas in the first two 
cases we are talking of an economic war, in the third the 
rattling of sabers can be heard. 
  On 21 March IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
Director General Blix declared that his agency was not demanding 
sanctions against the DPRK and that it did not possess any proof 
that North Korea had violated an international regulation in the 
sphere of nuclear technologies. But Clinton, as though wishing 
at all costs to outdo everyone, including both the IAEA and the 
United Nations, hastened to accounce that very day that he had 
already made the decision to station Patriot missile systems in 
South Korea. 
  But what, in fact, started it all? The Korean "nuclear 
crisis" seemed to have been settled three weeks ago. A kind of 
diplomatic deal had been concluded between official 
representatives of the DPRK and the United States under whose 
terms the DPRK was to admit IAEA inspectors to its nuclear 
installations in "exchange" for the U.S. abandonment of the Team 
Spirit maneuvers in South Korea and of the stationing of its 
missiles there and, in addition, for consent to hold top-level 
talks between Washington and Pyongyang in Geneva. 
  As for the DPRK, a group of international experts received 
the appropriate visas and inspected all seven of North Korea's 
stipulated nuclear installations 1 through 15 March. The 
inspectors discovered nothing untoward attesting to the military 
thrust of research. A slight argument with recriminations did, 
however, occur: The North Korean side reckoned that the IAEA 
experts had committed a number of violations of their previously 
stipulated inspection methods. But the experts reckoned for 
their part that they had not been granted sufficient 
opportunities to take samples at one of the seven installations 
-- the radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon. 
  Who is more right here? Let us assume it is the IAEA 
inspectors. This would mean that the DPRK fulfilled its pledges 
in the deal with the United States not 100 percent but only 99 
percent. Or maybe even just 85 or 75 percent. But what of the 
United States? It did not fulfill its pledges. It canceled the 
talks in Geneva, Team Spirit will very soon make the Korean 
Peninsula resound with the clank of caterpillar tracks and the 
explosion of shells, and they are threatening to deploy the 
Patriots even in April. And Russia signs nuclear disarmament 
agreements with such a partner? 
  It is totally absurd that the world press at once, as though 
on a command, began demonizing not the United States but the 
DPRK, portraying it as a rogue and disturber of the peace. Not, 
alas, without the complicity of the Russian mass media. 
  China's position is characterized by soundness, clarity, and 
prudence. As a state which has signed the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, State Council Premier Li 
Peng declared at a news conference in Beijing 22 March, the PRC 
does not support or encourage their proliferation. China 
constantly advocates resolving the question of a nuclear 
inspection in the DPRK by means of talks and does not approve of 
the use of pressure. Because not only will this not help to 
resolve the question, it will merely complicate and exacerbate 
the situation on the Korean Peninsula. 
  The positions of Russia and Japan are not clear. Will the 
former venture to demonstrate independence, as happened recently 
in respect of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Is the latter 
aware that, if the transoceanic "cowboy" is permitted to make 
such a commotion in Korea, his "lasso" will tighten itself 
primarily around Japan's own body?

  [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS--In response to the appeal of 
the Russian Government to resume talks between Abkhazia and 
Georgia on a peaceful settlement of the conflict, the Abkhazian 
side reiterated its readiness for talks. The Abkhazian 
leadership has always favoured a political settlement of 
controversial problems, the press service of the Abkhazian 
mission in Russia reported today. 
  The Georgian side also expressed readiness to resume talks. 
According to the Abkhazian press service, consultations at the 
Russian Foreign Ministry will probably begin this week. From 
the Abkhazian side they will be attended by Anri Dzhergenia, 
personal representative of the chairman of the Abkhazian Supreme 
Soviet, and Igor Abkha, official representative of the Republic 
of Abkhazia in Russia.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian President B. Yeltsin's </F>
wife Naina Yeltsina in Sochi by Gennadiy Bochkarev; date not 
given: "Conversation With President's Wife in Ready-to-Wear 
Store"] 
  [Text] My telephone rang, and although the caller was not 
phoning long-distance, the operator for some reason asked: "Is 
that...." "Yes," I replied. "Naina Iosifovna will talk to you 
now." 
  A few days ago I sent a letter to the Russian president's 
dacha in Sochi asking Naina Yeltsina to give KOMSOMOLSKAYA 
PRAVDA an interview. Who but his wife knows more about the 
president's health than any television news broadcasts? Who if 
not the closest person to the president is most concerned about 
his health? 
  We spoke on the telephone in "purely human terms." I did not 
ask her the routine questions about Boris Nikolayevich's 
weaknesses, but simply listened to a woman who has grown tired 
of gossip and seems to have gotten confused. 
  She sighed: "Boris Nikolayevich is very patient with all 
these false commentaries. He says: They'll get over it; pay no 
attention. But how can you help paying attention when someone 
is constantly poking their nose into your home? There is no 
defense against gossip, and sometimes I want to go out onto the 
street and scream: `Think again. Why is that so hard to do!'" 
  We met with Naina Iosifovna in a Sochi fashion house's 
store. 
The president's wife was buying gifts for her daughters and 
grandchildren. She is very fond of Sochi knitwear. As she met 
me Naina Yeltsina smiled and said: "Go ahead, ask your 
questions." 
  [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, excuse me, but I cannot wait to 
ask you this: Is it true that the Yeltsin family's favorite 
singer is Filipp Kirkorov? I read that somewhere. 
  [Yeltsina] I don't know who wrote that. Boris Nikolayevich 
has hardly heard Filipp Kirkorov at all, although I know some of 
his songs. But you would do better to ask us before talking 
about the Yeltsin family's taste in music. I like modern music, 
but there is no accounting for taste. Not everyone in our 
family likes Filipp Kirkorov's songs. 
  [Bochkarev] The president's family recently held a 
housewarming. How are things at the new home? 
  [Yeltsina] We have not moved in yet, but there is a host of 
varied rumors about our coming move. Actually, we are changing 
accommodations for security reasons. Our next-door neighbors in 
our old block sold their apartment and I don't even know who 
bought it. It seems to be some commercial organization. 
  [Bochkarev] Is it that easy to buy an apartment next door to 
the president? 
  [Yeltsina] There seems to be no difficulty in doing so. 
  [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, do you personally support the 
president's policy? 
  [Yeltsina] Tell me, has your life personally changed for the 
worse? 
  [Bochkarev] I suppose not. 
  [Yeltsina] You know that we talk to our friends. Believe 
me, they are not top-ranking officials; they are ordinary 
people, and none of them is complaining. I was in Sverdlovsk, 
now Yekaterinburg, and I cannot say that life has deteriorated 
there. Some people have it hard, some people have a difficult 
life. But things are no worse! In my opinion, people have 
received the most important thing -- freedom. No one harasses 
you now and you have an opportunity to earn as much money as you 
are capable of earning. And you can buy everything you want. 
Look back over the decades: When did we have such plentiful 
supplies in the stores? People still say that 80 percent of 
Russians are below the poverty line. Do the other 20 percent 
really buy up everything? Who believes that the businessmen in 
our vast country have directed their attention to only 20 
percent of the population? 
  [Bochkarev] Are you speaking as the president's wife? 
  [Yeltsina] Why are we here? When you read the newspapers 
you get the impression that Boris Nikolayevich does not want 
people to lead a better, easier life. How can this be 
accomplished for everyone at once? Who is going to find a magic 
way of making millions of people millionaires at a stroke? 
Regrettably, programs of that kind are not on offer. 
Regrettably, no one mentions the fact that the situation in 
Russia is more favorable than it is in the other republics of 
the former Union. That does not fit in with the opposition's 
scenario. The president would probably be far more successful 
if there were not the constant confrontation in society. 
  [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, do you feel like Russia's first 
lady? 
  [Yeltsina] I am the president's wife. I am by his side, and 
naturally we discuss some problems at home, but I never try to 
influence his decisionmaking. 
  [Bochkarev] As a rule presidents' wives are involved in 
charity foundations. 
  [Yeltsina] I don't head any foundations. I think that 
people have simply gotten themselves well fixed up in some of 
them.... 
  I am very worried about the lamentable state of children's 
health care. If equipment for a children's hospital is offered 
as a gift, for instance, during official visits abroad, it is a 
sin to refuse. 
  [Bochkarev] Don't you think that, when these protocol gifts 
are handed over, the children comed to look like an honor guard 
at official meetings? We came, we gave, we forgot.... 
  [Yeltsina] Following what you call these protocol gifts, I 
know that in at least one specific hospital a doctor can save a 
child's life. What difference does it make how this equipment 
got there -- by protocol or otherwise? 
  [Bochkarev] Tell me, do you call your husband Boris 
Nikolayevich at home? 
  [Yeltsina] Are you joking? I just call him Borya. 
  [Bochkarev] Does the president ask his family for the latest 
news "from the people"? 
  [Yeltsina] Naturally, our children work in normal 
collectives where they discuss politics and the economy with 
their colleagues, but none of us has managed to tell Boris 
Nikolayevich a piece of news that he did not know. 
  [Bochkarev] Naina Iosifovna, now we come to the last and 
perhaps most sensitive question: How is your husband feeling? 
  [Yeltsina] No country in the world speculates as much as we 
do about the president's health. He is indeed healthy! He came 
to Sochi, he has had a change of scene [smenil obstanovku], and 
that is as good as a vacation. He has played tennis and swum in 
the sea. Is that really a basis for gossip to spread around the 
world? What ailments haven't they devised for the president. 
If he gets the flu, that means he is seriously ill; if he's 
working at home, he's ill again. Boris Nikolayevich is not the 
enemy of his own health, and if he were seriously ill he would 
long since have quit his job. All this talk of illness is dirty 
politics. Why have they suddenly caused this sensation? 
Because 1996 is approaching and they have to somehow prove that 
Boris Nikolayevich is a sick man. But, believe me, any gossip 
is easier to bear than lies about his health....

  [Text] The work on the draft agreement on civic peace in 
Russia was completed last Saturday and the document will soon be 
submitted to President Boris Yeltsin. This was disclosed to 
Interfax on Monday by a member of the drafting team. 
  The source said that the document suggests renouncing early 
elections, potentially destabilizing constitutional amendments 
and the politically charged comments on the events of October 
1993. 
  The draft reportedly includes the formation of a public body 
to ensure all sides observe the agreement. It should be signed 
by federal government bodies, federation members, parliamentary 
groups, political movements, public organizations and trade 
unions. 
  If the terms are violated by any party, they will be asked 
to 
leave the political arena. 
  At the initiative of the president the document was drafted 
by five working groups on the following spheres: politics, 
economy, regional and ethnic matters, culture, security. 
  Earlier on Monday a well-informed source close to the 
president told Interfax that the final text of the draft 
agreement will be handed to Yeltsin within the next few hours.

<F P=106> [Report by Valentin Razboynikov: "Ulyanovsk Democrats' Plea </F>
Granted: Elections Are Postponed"] 
  [Text] Ulyanovsk -- The incident is unprecedented for 
Russia: In response to a complaint from the regional center of 
the democratic reform movement, certain provisions on the 
elections that had already been ratified by the local 
administration have been ruled juridically null and void by the 
Ulyanovsk Oblast Court in open session. 
  Many grievances were set out in the suit, but perhaps the 
most important was that the electoral districts had been 
incorrectly apportioned. "In the administrative-territorial 
districts the number of voters fluctuates between 10,335 and 
173,665," the plea runs. "This contradicts the basic 
provisions...." In the democrats' opinion, this would lead to 
"more than 60 percent of deputies being elected to the 
legislative assembly from a rural population which constitutes 
47 percent of the oblast's inhabitants, while the 53 percent of 
voters who live in the cities will elect only 37 percent of the 
deputies." 
  The court hearing lasted several days. Meanwhile, in the 
local press, the idea was hammered home -- whether for the 
benefit of the court or that of the voters -- that the basic 
provisions on the elections confirmed by the president were 
purely recommendatory in character. As a component of the 
Federation the oblast has the right to make its own amendments 
to the statute. This argument was also heard in the hall of 
sessions. In response Oleg Timofeyev, presiding over the court, 
said clearly: "In the event of a contradiction between federal 
law and another act, the federal law applies." 
  Claims that the president's basic provisions on elections 
are 
recommendatory in character were also ruled unfounded. The 
large disproportions in the numbers of voters apparent in the 
division of the districts were ruled "not in conformity with the 
law." 
  The court's ruling was made public, but it has not yet been 
issued either to the plaintiff or to the defendant. I have 
quoted this document from a tape recording. It has yet to be 
edited and printed, as is the custom in these cases.... 
Meanwhile, only two days remain before the elections. 
  In the evening, people seeking seats in the local duma vied 
with one another in eloquence on local television as if nothing 
had happened. The Ulyanovsk press appeals: "We hope that the 
citizens of Ulyanovsk will not allow the elections to be 
disrupted, and will confirm this with a high turnout...." 
  On 25 March Yuriy Goryachev, head of the oblast 
administration, ordered the elections postponed to a later date. 
He also adopted an appeal to the oblast's voters. This says 
that everything was ready for the elections, but that a group of 
political intriguers under the banner of democratic forces had 
managed to torpedo the elections. The oblast court, in Yu. 
Goryachev's opinion, was also under their thumb.

  [Text] Representatives of the Ukrainian public and 
political organizations in Crimea and the Crimean-Tatar National 
Movement Organization have issued a joint statement. The 
statement points out gross violations of the law in Crimea 
during the course of the election campaign and during the 
election itself. These include campaigning on the eve of 
election, the issue of several ballot papers to one person, the 
issue of ballot papers to people without identification, and 
pressure on the electoral commissions and voters exerted by 
representatives of the Rossiya bloc. The worst violation, the 
statement says, was the propaganda speech by president of 
Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, on local television last Friday. 
  The authors of the statement are convinced that the 
situation 
in Crimea will continue to deteriorate if Yuriy Meshkov, his 
administration and the newly elected Supreme Council fail to 
work constructively to preserve peace and stability on the 
peninsula. Proceeding from this, the statement says, cooperation 
between Ukrainian and Crimean-Tatar organizations has acquired 
special significance. The Ukrainian organizations will be even 
more uncompromising in defending the interests of the Crimean 
Tatars through their central offices in Kiev and their deputies 
in Ukraine's Supreme Council. The Crimean-Tatar National 
Movement Organization will support Ukrainian organizations on 
the issues of preserving Ukraine's territorial integrity and 
consolidating Ukrainian statehood on the territory of Crimea.

  [Text] After the ceremony of signing Russo-Kazakh 
documents, Russian President Boris Yeltsin told Interfax that no 
political issues had been aroused around Russia's leasing the 
cosmodrome in Baykonur. 
  "The talks focused on problems concerning the maintenance of 
a city in the steppe where the cosmodrome's workers live. We 
have solved this issue. I am confident that our children and 
grandchildren will use Baykonur in the 21st century in the 
interests of both Russia and Kazakhstan," Yeltsin was quoted as 
saying. 
  For his part, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put a 
special emphasis on Russia's important role in the development 
of Kazakhstan's scientific, technological and cultural 
potential. No speculation about Kazakhstan's alleged cooling 
towards Russia have any grounds, he added. 
  The two presidents signed four main documents out of 23 
bilateral accords adopted as a result of the summit, including 
treaties on the further enhancement of economic cooperation and 
integration, on the strategic nuclear forces temporarily 
stationed in Kazakhstan, on military cooperation and a 
memorandum on the basic principles for the resolution of issues 
related to the citizenship and the legal status of Russian and 
Kazakh citizens residing on the territory of the other state. 
  Yeltsin received letters of ratification on Kazakhstan's 
joining the non-proliferation treaty from his Kazakh counterpart.

  [Text] Moscow March 28 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin praised the results of Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev's first official visit to Russia as "very successful." 
  Meeting journalists after the ceremony of signing 
Russian-Kazakh bilateral agreements in the Kremlin on Monday, 
Yeltsin described the visit as "the first and very important 
official visit by the head of the Republic of Kazakhstan to 
Russia." 
  Yeltsin said Russia and Kazakhstan signed a record number of 
bilateral agreements. The prime ministers of the two countries 
and Russian and Kazakh governmental delegations signed a total 
of 23 bilateral agreements, including on political, economic and 
military cooperation. 
  "Russia and Kazakhstan already have the basis of bilateral 
relations, namely the bilateral treaty of friendship and 
cooperation," he continued. "But this document needs to be 
developed and expanded." The Russian leader said that all the 
documents had been prepared thoroughly and long. The agreement 
on the Baykonur cosmodrome had been ironed out for nearly a year. 
  Nazarbayev stressed that his visit "sweeps away all talks 
and 
rumours about Russia's imperial activity." Both sides had 
"overcome all difficulties," he added. 
  Commenting on the agreement on Baykonur, Nazarbayev replied 
that the Kazakh side "understands how important Baykonur is for 
Russia now," added that "Kazakhstan did not want to keep it in 
its pocket." 
  Yeltsin noted that the "difficulties which emerged in this 
issue were connected not with the political aspect, but mostly 
with the technical and economic one." 
  The president explained that the latter concerned primarily 
technical and economic support for the people living in the city 
of Leninsk and servicing the cosmodrome. 
  Under the agreement, Kazakhstan will lease the cosmodrome to 
Russia for 20 years with further prolongation of the term for 
another ten years. Russia will pay 115 million U.S. dollars to 
Kazakhstan annually in lease payments. The agreement also 
considers Baykonur Russian territory for the duration of the 
lease period where all Russian laws will have equal force as in 
the rest of Russia. 
  The two presidents also signed an agreement on the 
development of economic cooperation and integration, a 
memorandum of the basic principles of resolving issues 
concerning the civil and legal status of citizens of Kazakhstan 
living in Russia and Russian citizens residing in Kazakhstan, an 
agreement on military cooperation and an agreement on strategic 
nuclear forces temporarily stationed in Kazakhstan.

  [Text] President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev told 
the staff of Moscow University that politicians were lagging 
behind their people's wish to unite. 
  To quote Nazarbayev, a new state entity -- the Eurasian 
union 
with supra-national bodies for coordinating economic and 
military policies -- might be created. 
  Such a union should have a single parliament, council of 
defense ministers and defense complex, and an inter-state 
secretariat appointed by the heads of state. 
  Nazarbayev also said that such a union might pursue a single 
economic policy, have common borders, and use a supra-national 
currency retaining the member-states' national currencies. 
  The member-states would maintain good-neighborly relations 
with other former Soviet republics. 
  Nazarbayev announced that this problem had been discussed in 
Moscow with President Yeltsin. 
  Speaking about the talks, Nazarbayev emphasized that the end 
must be put to the tendency of accusing Russia of all mortal 
sins. He also said that the well-being of his republic was 
inextricably linked with Russia. 
  He pointed out that the Russian-Kazakh summit marked a new 
stage in the two countries' economic unification and represented 
an example to be followed by the other CIS countries. The 
agreements signed in Moscow provide for setting up financial and 
industrial groups and joint ventures. They also envisage 
measures to facilitate the movement of capital and labor between 
Russia and Kazakhstan, said Nazarbayev. 
  To quote the Kazakh president, the Russian and Kazakh 
defense 
ministries would conclude an agreement on joint planning and 
interaction. "In fact, a single defense system is being 
created," he said. 
  The Russian and Kazakh governments have been instructed to 
conclude an agreement on the utilization of military testing 
grounds located in Russia and Kazakhstan, said Nazarbayev.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F>
Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- "Thanks to the presence in 
`trouble spots' of Russian peacemaking forces, far more numerous 
civilian casualties have been prevented." Thus reads a joint 
statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of 
Defense of the Russian Federation [RF] with which Grigoriy 
Karasin, director of the Information and Press Department of the 
RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs, acquainted journalists at 
today's briefing. 
  "The document states that claims have been made recently in 
remarks by certain politicians and foreign media publications 
about the `ambiguousness' of Russia's peacemaking mission on the 
territories of several countries within the CIS." Furthermore, 
"not only have facts been arbitrarily interpreted but also 
freely or unintentionally distorted." 
  As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry 
of Defense of the Russian Federation stated that "Russia's 
actions are aimed only at halting armed clashes in a number of 
newly independent states, at stabilizing the situation there, 
and at creating the conditions for long-term and stable 
settlements." Over the past ten months alone, Russia has spent 
about 26 billion rubles [R] on peacemaking. There are over 
15,000 Russian servicemen in `trouble spots' on the territory of 
the CIS states. 
  Peacemaking in Commonwealth countries is not "something 
Russia does on its own initiative," the document stresses. In 
all cases without exception, Russia's actions have been 
undertaken at the request and with the consent of the states 
concerned and of the sides involved in the conflicts. This is 
also fully in line with the provisions of the UN Charter, which 
not only allows for, but also welcomes the possibility of 
settling the questions of maintaining peace on the basis of 
agreements between the interested states. Russia has 
consistently advocated the broadest participation of the UN and 
the CSCE in settling the conflicts in CIS countries, the 
statement says. 
  "Firmly pursuing the course towards ensuring peace and 
stability around its borders and towards abiding by its 
commitments under agreements with the countries concerned within 
the framework of the CIS, Russia is not setting its efforts 
against anyone. We are not demanding a special place or an 
exceptional role, but neither are we evading our responsibility 
for the situation in this key region for Russia," says the joint 
statement from Russia's foreign and defense ministries.

Consolidates its Positions. Ministry Gets Government Support"] 
  [Text] Officially circulated yesterday was a Russian 
Federation Government decree, "Questions of the Russian 
Federation Ministry on Cooperation with Member States of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States." The Ministry on 
Cooperation with the CIS Member States has received a stable 
material base in the shape of personnel, financial support, and 
buildings. Besides, until provisions on the Ministry of 
Cooperation with the CIS Member States have been approved, the 
government decree will provide the legal basis for the 
ministry's operation. 
  The Russian Federation State Committee on Economic 
Cooperation with Member States of the Commonwealth 
(Goskomsotrudnichestvo) was formed in late 1991. One of the 
committee's prerogatives, as it was steadily gaining in 
influence, was defending Russia's interests in matters of 
cooperation with former Union republics. As of last fall, the 
committee took up the problems of restoring Russia's trade and 
economic links with countries of the former Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance for which purpose a special directorate was 
created inside its apparatus. There was a valid reason for it: 
before the CMEA's dissolution, the share of its participants in 
Russia's foreign trade was 50 percent, and as little as 20 
percent in 1993. 
  In forming an economic union of CIS countries (whose 
founding 
documents were signed in Moscow on 24 September 1993), the 
Russian Committee on Economic Cooperation with Member States of 
the Commonwealth was also virtually the only 
coordination-consultative and expert organ having what in fact 
were intergovernmental prerogatives because similar government 
structures were not in place yet in the other CIS member 
countries. Besides, one should take account of the fact that 
the currently functioning Commonwealth organizational structure, 
which includes councils of the heads of states and governments, 
a coordination-consultative committee, and an executive 
secretariat, has no bodies so far that regularly check up on the 
observance of decisions made by the executive organs of the 
economic union. The question of setting up an Interstate 
Economic Council is only to be considered at the upcoming summit 
in late April. 
  The committee's broader functions increased its status, with 
the result that it was turned into a ministry early in 1994. At 
the same time, its activities have not undergone appreciable 
changes: the ministry remains a test ground (proceeding from the 
priority of Russian interests) for various projects of 
development of economic integration with a special stress on the 
credit and finance sphere.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 29, BNS -- Russia's official policy 
with regard to ethnic Russians residing in Latvia and Estonia 
will target the restoration of their status as citizens, states 
the citizenship commission under the Russian president in the 
proposals for a concept of Russia's policy toward compatriots 
abroad it approved Tuesday [29 March]. 
  "Russia adheres to the principle of dual citizenship, which 
in recent years has become a reality," the commission's 
proposals read. "To have it legally fixed, relevant bilateral 
agreements must be concluded." 
  The commission claims that "dual citizenship doesn't 
preclude 
the formation of new states or violate their sovereignty," and 
emphasizes that the proposed measures "are not aimed at 
interference in the domestic affairs" of the Baltic states. The 
Baltic states' legislation, however, does not provide for dual 
citizenship. 
  According to the commission's proposals, Russia must also 
strive for the preservation of Russian as "the language of 
inter-ethnic communication" in the entire information space of 
the former Soviet Union. 
  The commission said its proposals are due to the fact that 
"hundreds of thousands of people in Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia have been deprived of citizenship, which causes 
infringement of their right to vote and the right to ownership, 
and even puts in question their right to live in those 
countries." The commission expressed concern that "disregard of 
human rights may give rise to social and political conflicts." 
  "In recognizing the newly independent states formed on the 
basis of former Soviet republics, Russia expected the 
legislation of those countries to meet international legal 
standards," the commission stated. 
  The Baltic states' policies stem from a different principle. 
Having restored their independence after the 50-year occupation, 
Latvia and Estonia reinstituted also the principle of hereditary 
citizenship. Lithuania, whose territory underwent considerable 
changes in the course of World War II, chose the so-called zero 
option of citizenship, under which all persons residing in the 
country are eligible for its citizenship.

  [Text] Moscow, Mar 29, BNS -- The Baltic states didn't 
join the Soviet Union in 1940 of their own free will, but it 
cannot be regarded as annexation, either, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated in an interview to BNS today. 
  "Despite everything, Russia condemns the Molotov-Ribbentrop 
pact and the Stalinist oppression," Kozyrev said in the 
interview. 
  The Russian foreign minister met today with the Conference 
on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe High Commissioner for 
National Minorities Max van der Stoel to discuss the problems of 
ethnic minorities in Estonia and Latvia. 
  Stoel voiced the opinion that there are many problems in the 
framework of the ethnic issue which are waiting to be solved. 
"On the one hand, the preservation of those states' national 
character needs to be safeguarded; on the other, the future of 
the Russians living there must be secured on an equal footing," 
the CSCE high commissioner maintained. 
  Speaking about the alleged human rights violations in 
Estonia 
and Latvia, Stoel admitted that "neither torturing nor 
deportation of members of ethnic minorities occurs there." 
  Yet, he said, both countries have serious problems 
pertaining 
to the legal status of the Russian-speaking population. "I 
drafted numerous recommendations to remedy the matter and I hope 
they will be accepted," Stoel said. 
  Kozyrev said Russia expects the Baltic Sea countries to 
establish the post of a regional national minorities 
commissioner. 
  The Russian foreign minister said that the troop withdrawal 
negotiations with Estonia and Latvia have reached the final 
stage. All issues, including that of social protection for 
Russian military pensioners, have been resolved, he claimed. 
"The package of agreements will be signed after discussion in 
the Estonian and the Latvian parliaments and approval by those 
countries' heads of state," was Kozyrev's opinion. 
  Kozyrev emphasized that Russia managed to coordinate the 
troop withdrawal with Lithuania and Latvia "in a civilized 
manner, on a contractual basis." The signing of a similar 
agreement with Estonia now depends on that Baltic nation, he 
said. In Kozyrev's view, this will help "Russia's friends in 
the West" to focus attention on the protection of human rights 
in Estonia and Latvia. 
  Russia withdrew its troops from Lithuania by September 1993. 
To date, also a troop pullout agreement with Latvia has been 
initialed. The problem of the status of Russian military 
pensioners remains the stumbling-block at the Estonian-Russian 
talks.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on the 
continuing rise in the cost of living in Russia. 
  New tariffs for electric power for public utility needs will 
double in April, the newspaper points out, recalling at the same 
time that the average tariffs for electric power in Russia are 
lower than the world ones by a factor of three to four while the 
prices of metal, pipes, power equipment and spares "have already 
attained the world level". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI also reports the signing of 20 documents 
on 
Russia-Kazakhstan cooperation during Kazakhstan President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to moscow, the long-awaited 
agreement on Baykonur cosmodrome, in particular. 
  TRUD and other newspapers also dwell on the baikonur topic. 
TRUD carries an article headlined "Baykonur ceases to be an 
'apple of discord', Russia leases the cosmodrome for 20 years". 
  ROSSIYA newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy Sliva, 
chairman of the State Duma committee on local self-government 
matters. 
  "Local self-government in Russia is in a unique position 
now: 
the rights of local power bodies have been formulated and 
stipulated in the constitution at the level of the highest world 
standards, whereas the current legislation, decrees, various 
decisions, and subordinate legislation obviously contradict the 
constitution," Sliva said. 
  ROSSIYA runs an interview with Russian Liberal-Democratic 
Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who does not rule out, in 
particular, the emergence of some new self-proclaimed 
state-of-emergency committee in the country. "Something is 
certain to happen in a period from April to November -- either 
an emergency committee or developments similar to the October of 
1993 or some other version of events", he maintains. 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) carries an article dedicated to 
the birth anniversary of legendary aircraft designer Sergey 
Ilyushin. 
  "Even in the present-day difficult economic situation, 
Russia 
has got to find strength and wisdom to maintain the research and 
production potential which in future will enable it to remain 
among the world's leading aircraft makers", the newspaper 
emphasises. 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on a rising suicide rate in Russia: 
  "This always happens during election campaigns: a great 
number of people from among the socially most vulnerable 
sections of the population -- tramps, unemployed, students and 
pensioners -- commit suicides upon becoming convinced of the 
unrealistic nature of political parties' election-campaign 
promises". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the problems of the Crimea: 
  "Following the elections to the Crimean parliament and an 
opinion poll, president Yuriy Meshkov's slogan 'my goal is to 
secure the reunification of the Crimea with Russia', due to 
which he scored an electoral win, "acquires increasingly 
distinct contours". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Russian State 
Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin. 
  "We should not allow a recurrence of the October 4, 1993, 
events which signified our overall defeat", Rybkin stated, 
voicing confidence in the success of reforms being effected in 
the country. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reprints an interview of Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk with the newspaper KRYMSKIE VESTI 
(Crimean News) under a headline quoting his as saying: "I stand 
on this: Ukraine should be side-by-side with Russia, not under 
Russia." 
  PRAVDA runs an interview with writer Yuriy Vlasov, a member 
of the State Duma. 
  "It would be the greatest sin if all upright people fail to 
rely on the sense of patriotism in resisting the tough struggle, 
a struggle of expermination [as received], which is now under 
way in Russia and against Russia", the newspaper quotes Vlasov 
as saying.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 29 March; from the 
"Vesti" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How do you assess those questions 
that are still to be solved in Russian-Kazakh relations? We 
have signed about two dozen various agreements and treaties. 
What still lies ahead? There are bottlenecks, complicated 
areas, etc., but there are prospects, there are things where 
further efforts -- very serious ones -- need to be undertaken. 
What spheres and areas do you see in this direction? 
  [Nazarbayev] Since our big treaty, as it is being called, 
the 
Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid signed between 
Kazakhstan and Russia in 1992, where everything that we have 
accomplished today was written, it may be considered that this 
is the concrete development of the big agreement that was 
ratified by both parliaments. Therefore, these 24 documents -- 
23 documents -- which we signed, they give concrete expression 
to it. I am particularly pleased, for example, that Boris 
Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I agreed to set up a joint economic 
commission that will be headed, from both our and the Russian 
side, by deputy prime ministers who will in turn take the chair 
every half-year, first in Moscow and then in Alma-Ata [Almaty]. 
They will be obliged, every quarter and every half-year, to 
report to the governments and presidents on how these accords 
are being fulfilled. 
  An exhaustive number of documents were signed; for example, 
[the document] on defense cooperation does not require further 
development; on Baykonur, we came to a final decision on this 
question; on deepening economic cooperation, we still have to 
solve questions of customs space and on duty quotas between our 
states, setting up joint industrial-finance groups; on joint 
enterprises, the shares of Kazakh enterprises may be acquired by 
Russian enterprises, and vice-versa. Well, on these things the 
government has been given a period of one month in which 
specific agreements must be signed. But life being what it is, 
an agreement must be put into operation, the mechanism must be 
applied; certain problems may arise that we will tackle. 
  Other matters were left to one side and that is why I 
invited 
Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin to Alma-Ata. He 
accepted my invitation and I think that it [the meeting] will 
take place in the summer, and we will develop these relations 
still further. 
  [Correspondent] Nursultan Abishevich, a very important 
dimension, not only in bilateral relations, but also for every 
state, is the human dimension. The priority of the individual, 
the priority of the rights of the individual, and freedoms -- 
this is indisputable. Today, we are striving to push forward to 
this, although it is complicated both for Russia and for 
Kazakhstan, indeed for any country. It has its problems. How 
did you see interaction in this direction -- not only in terms 
of bilateral efforts but also within the CIS framework, and 
perhaps to move more widely, after all our country [Russia] and 
Kazakhstan are in many ways linked with the CSCE, and in many 
ways we belong both to Europe and to Asia, and this sense of two 
continents, how can this, let us say, take shape in terms of 
forms, of tools of interaction in human terms? 
  [Nazarbayev] I understand what you mean. There used to be 
one state -- the Soviet Union. It split up into what are now 15 
states, whose people used to live in one homeland, one country, 
and have found themselves the citizens of 15 states. But it 
would not be correct to say that the people do not have 
problems, because people are concerned, people are worried. 
Previously, there was no problem about where one's son lived, 
where one's father lived, where one was coming and going. Now 
all these problems have arisen. We really are faced with 
problems of the Russian people living in all of the Republics. 
And questions have arisen of the 1 million Kazakhs living in 
Russia. So, if you are speaking of our human relations, I 
believe that this is one of our main questions. And in the 
memorandum on citizenship that we signed -- and I would like to 
answer the first part of your question and then move on to the 
other part -- we said that there should be special 
interrelations between Kazakhstan and Russia, as I have always 
said. We did not make these up, they developed through history, 
and to pass on these relations which we have had to our children 
and grandchildren is a task for the politicians -- for us. 
  Therefore, we said that if someone in Kazakhstan moves to 
Russia, he should be able to obtain citizenship there without 
question, without any delays. If he comes back to Kazakhstan, 
or a Russian decides to move to Kazakhstan permanently, he must 
be able to obtain citizenship straightaway. In other words, an 
individual must have freedom of choice as to where he wishes to 
live. At the same time, there should be no obstacles in the way 
of how he sells his house, takes away the property he has 
acquired, and so on, during the period of the move. I think 
that this worries people, and the most important thing is to 
alleviate this concern. 
  Secondly, you correctly said that we are situated at the 
meeting point of Europe and Asia, especially in Kazakhstan, in 
the very center of Asia. Therefore, our sense of multipolarity 
in our economic relations is clear because Kazakhs have, as we 
know, have always belonged to the Islamic culture, although I do 
not think we have such a strong sense of religion, so to speak. 
Now, as in Russia, where there are about 20 million Turkic 
Muslims, and 50 million Turkic Muslims live in Central Asia -- 
the Asian part -- therefore, it is also necessary for them to be 
identified with and to seek out their historic culture and roots 
in these states. Therefore, situated between China and Russia, 
in the south of the Muslim world, we are trying to be 
multipolar. I think -- this is my opinion -- and Russia's, too, 
that to have equally effective relations, both with Europe and 
Asia, this is, it seems to me, a correct policy that we are 
pursuing. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F>
Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky] 
  [Text] At a meeting with the Turkmenian Foreign Ministry's 
staff President Saparmurad Niyazov pointed out that "Turkmenia 
has its own ways of development and its own model of democracy. 
We are building an open society in which all human rights will 
be respected. Each citizen can voice his/her opinion, but when 
a majority takes a decision, a minority should follow." 
  Niyazov expressed regret that until now Western countries 
continue to accuse Turkmenia of violating human rights and the 
lack of democracy. "I am convinced that there is no more 
democratic state than ours nowadays," he stated. 
  According to the president, there is not a single political 
prisoner in the republic, anybody can organize a party, "if its 
has regulations, program, supporters and if it acts within the 
framework of the constitution and the law." 
  Speaking about priorities in the foreign policy, Niyazov 
again stressed that Turkmenia will cooperate with Russia on an 
equal basis "whatever the power in Moscow." In the president's 
opinion, "it is necessary to choose five-six states for having 
close relations with them." Among these Niyazov named all 
countries neighboring Turkmenistan. "The break-off in relations 
with them will lead to damage for each side." 
  Niyazov also said that every CIS meeting passes "hard" for 
him and that he feels "pressing." Particularly, when proposals 
come in on Turkmenia's more active role in the Tajik and Abkhaz 
issues and on the entry in military or economic unions. In his 
opinion, today many states on the territory of the former Soviet 
Union facing problems after gaining independence cannot cope and 
start to support the ideas of creating some coordinating centers 
and structures. "Turkmenia will pursue its policy without 
entering any alliances," Niyazov pointed out. 
  The president urged diplomats to clearly see the goals of 
the 
state and to trust the government policy and be able to explain 
to representatives of other countries. 
  In conclusion, Niyazov approved a resolution on the ministry 
and its top officials. In the resolution he excluded only 
articles "on the organizational and methodical control by the 
Foreign Ministry over foreign economic activites of ministries 
and departments" and "on the obligatory implementation of 
Foreign Ministry's resolutions on foreign policy by ministries 
and departments."

  [Text] A reorganization of Turkmenistan's Armed Forces is 
soon to start in the Republic. The basic principles of the 
reorganization were set out at an expanded session of the 
country's Defense Council by President Saparmurad Niyazov. It 
provides for the establishment of the Defense Council and a 
National Security Council, a General Staff and Headquarters of 
the Armed Forces and rear services. The numerical strength of 
the country's Armed Forces is to be cut in line with the 
principle of essential defense sufficiency. Niyazov stressed 
the particular role of Russian officers in forming the Turkmen 
Army and noted the coincidence of the strategic interests of 
Turkmenistan and Russia.

  [Text] The Supreme Soviet session is currently being held 
behind closed doors. As our correspondent has learned, deputies 
have focused their attention on the monetary-credit policy. 
Probably, we will be able to tell you about the adopted 
decisions, however, only approximately, because this issue, 
according to the parliament speaker, is secret. 
  This day can be considered, to certain degree, momentous in 
the work of the 13th session of the Supreme Soviet. Deputies 
have finally scheduled the presidential elections -- this event 
has been scheduled for 23 June 1994, for a regular working 
weekday. However, it used to be a regular working day -- it 
will be proclaimed a holiday, and we will have to make our 
choice. 
  At today's session, deputies also discussed legislation on 
the Belarusian Constitutional Court and adopted a resolution on 
implementing it.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Starikevich: "Kebich Praises Russian </F>
Parliament, While Belorusian Communists Are Already 
Collaborating Closely With Duma"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The problem of the unification of the 
monetary systems has moved definitively from an economic plane 
onto a political one in Belorusia [Belarus]. 
  Parliament has finally decided to turn the "hare" 
[Belarusian 
currency unit] into a lion, in other words to designate the 
Belorusian ruble as the only means of payment on the Republic's 
territory until the actual unification of the monetary systems. 
But Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich upset the applecart the day 
before by initialing a draft decree establishing new status for 
the settlement notes [raschetnyy bilet] of the National Bank of 
Belorusia. Journalists were asked to leave the Supreme Soviet 
hall before the latest decisive speech by the head of the 
government. Nevertheless, IZVESTIYA has acquired a transcript 
of Vyacheslav Kebich's speech. 
  The prime minister started by saying that he had accused 
Kovalin, deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, and 
Kazmin, Russian deputy minister of finance, of attempting to 
wreck the unification. According to Kebich, they have made 
amendments to the documents which had been coordinated by 
experts and distorted their meaning. As a result, fundamental 
differences have appeared in the sides' positions on the 
following questions: the rate of exchange of Belorusian cash 
rubles for Russian rubles, the equalization of the price of 
deliveries of output between subjects of economic activity, the 
unification of the budgets, and the status of the National Bank 
of Belorusia. According to the head of the Belorusian 
Government, the first two differences can be resolved easily, 
but the political aspects (that is specifically how the 
proposals on the single budget and the abolition of the National 
Bank of Belorusia are viewed) are unacceptable to the Republic. 
Despite this, Kebich stated with characteristic optimism that 
the monetary union would be signed in the near future, by 1 
April to be precise. 
  It is interesting that the Russian parliament provides the 
main hopes for the Belorusian supporters of the unification. 
The prime minister, who spoke very warmly about it, literally 
stated the following: "Sittings of all factions of the State 
Duma are being held now, at this very moment, about immediately 
signing this treaty." And he went on to say: "The unification 
must be signed and a president elected, otherwise the people 
will simply not understand what we are doing." The reference to 
popular opinion sounds fairly amusing from the lips of the prime 
minister, since nowadays it is no secret to anyone that he has a 
personal interest in this game. Kebich is calculating that the 
first positive results of the unification will enable him to 
occupy the presidential post. And if he is not making a show of 
this in public, then he expressed himself fairly definitely at 
the closed sitting. 
  While the prime minister was persuading Belorusian 
parliamentarians that the monetary systems should be unified, 
the Russians were being persuaded by a delegation of the 
procommunist People's Movement of Belorusia. The actual fact of 
its trip to Moscow cannot fail to cause surprise: On what 
grounds is a sociopolitical organization conducting talks with 
the supreme legislative organ of another country? Inasmuch as 
no one has officially authorized the Belorusian Communists to 
carry out this action, it is logical to assume that the trip 
took place thanks to close ties at party level. 
  The results of this visit, as well as the arrival of 
Nikolay Gonchar, chairman of the Federation Council Finance 
Committee, and the unequivocal support he expressed for the 
agreement on the unification of the monetary systems has 
strengthened the Belorusian Government, which had been on the 
point of becoming dispirited. 
  Meanwhile, another view of the problem exists outside of the 
government. Leonid Kozik, chairman of the Belorusian Supreme 
Soviet Commission for Economic Reform, told journalists that the 
unification process will be drawn out over a fairly long period 
of time. National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich 
expressed himself even more definitely, calling on the 
population to "stop waiting," because "this business would just 
fizzle out." 
  Nevertheless, the Belorusian Government has the chance to 
sign the agreement; but at what price? The answer to this 
question was provided in the agreement on the amalgamation of 
"Beltransgaz," the state enterprise for the transportation and 
deliveries of gas, with Russia's "Gazprom" Joint-Stock 
Association, which was submitted to the Supreme Soviet for 
ratification. Under the agreement, the value of the property of 
the Belorusian enterprise has been estimated at 1,000,217,000 
rubles (that is approximately how much it now costs to build one 
multiapartment housing block). According to independent experts' 
estimates, "Beltransgaz" is worth at least $5 billion. Thus, 
one of the political groupings intends to pay for its prosperity 
with a state asset. Not only that, the government press is 
already very actively discussing the idea of giving up 
sovereignty. 
  One way or another, it is already clear that the stories 
about the unification of the monetary systems, like the ones 
about the friendly union of fraternal peoples which will give 
rise to a land of milk and honey, are not well founded. The 
reality is that it is each man for himself today, and if the 
unification does nevertheless take place, there is no point in 
expecting gifts from Russia. And the question of whether an 
entrance fee proves its worth remains a big one.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/3/1994 -- President Snegur 
met today with a group of experts from the World Bank (WB), says 
a Presidential Press Service communique. Moldova has sufficient 
credibility in the eyes of the World Bank's Coordinating Council 
and due to this it has granted Moldova $300 million credit so 
far. Teodor Stolojan, World Bank's expert in privatization 
problems, said that a group of experts representing the 
executive power and the parliamentary commissions should be 
organized during the formation of new government. This group 
will discuss the privatization program for 1994-95. In 
Stolojan's opinion, "it is very important to take decisions at 
already solved in other countries," says the communique. Leonid 
Talmaci, Moldovan National Bank Governor, pointed out that the 
WB had reduced the interest rate for its credits due to a 
decrease of inflation to 10 percent in early March. President 
Snegur said that in his speech to the new parliament he will 
emphasize specifically the promotion of economic reforms in pace 
with a program for the social assistance of vulnerable groups. 
Snegur noted that it is difficult to attain these objectives and 
this is due to the conservatism of certain enterprises' managers 
and oppositionist speculations. He said the opposition 
manipulates the population in a difficult moment with a 
well-defined aim to gain political capital, says the communique.

  [Text] Moldovan President Mircea Snegur has said that the 
main goal of the new parliament and the whole nation should be 
strengthening the Republic's statehood. Speaking before the 
newly elected parliament Tuesday, he said society expected the 
new legislature to ensure further development and strengthening 
of the state in the interests of all its citizens, regardless of 
their origin or faith. 
  Snegur pointed out that various political forces had 
appeared 
on Moldova's political scene after the collapse of totalitarian 
rule. At the moment, they are divided into supporters of 
strengthening Moldova's statehood and independence, supporters 
of the unification with Romania and supporters of the republic's 
return to a reborn empire. 
  In the meantime, the Moldovan people firmly supported 
Moldova's development as an independent democratic state at the 
sociological poll on 6 March, Snegur said. The outcomes of the 
poll must be law for everyone, he said pointing out that "a 
state cannot be built on the basis of an idea which splits and 
polarizes society." 
  Snegur pointed to the top priority of such goals as the 
adoption of a new constitution, preservation of Moldova's 
territorial integrity, resolution of the issues of Transdniester 
and Gagauz-populated areas, democratization of society and 
enhancing economic reforms. 
  Snegur also proposed a special law be adopted against 
insulting Moldova as a state.

  [Text] Tiraspol (Dniester Province) 29 Mar, TASS -- The 
command of the 14th Russian Army deployed in Moldova's 
self-style Dniester Province, has warned Dniester leaders 
against what it called "political provocations." 
  The military command issued a statement on Tuesday [29 
March] 
retaliating a recent amendment to the Dniester laws which 
declared all Army weapons, equipment and other hardware 
belonging to Tiraspol. 
  "Tiraspol actually provokes seizure of the 14th Army's 
weapons and equipment," the statement said and qualified the 
actions of Dniester leaders as "demonstrating extreme disrespect 
towards the Russian Federation and its peace-keeping efforts in 
the region." 
  The Army command demanded the annulment of the "provocative" 
amendment.

  [Text] Kishinev 29 Mar, TASS -- Petr Luchinskiy, a leader 
of the Agrarian Democratic Party that won the preterm 
parliamentary elections in February, was elected speaker of the 
Moldovan parliament on Tuesday. He was elected by a secret 
ballot, earning 57 votes. There were 43 votes against, and two 
ballots were found invalid. 
  Luchinsky is 54 years old. In perestroika years he was first 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Moldovan Communist 
Party, secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet 
Communist Party, CPSU. He was elected speaker of the previous 
Moldovan parliament after an acute parliamentary crisis last 
year. The parliament, torn by contradictions, had to be 
dissolved. 
  It is the first time that a Moldovan parliament has been 
formed on a multiparty basis. It will include 104 deputies. 
The Agrarian Democratic Party will have parliamentary majority, 
56 deputies. 
  Agrarians believe that the legislative body should above all 
adopt a new constitution, create a legislative base for economic 
reform, and resolve the Dniester and Gagauz problems through 
granting special legal status to these territories.

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 28/3/1994 -- Today, the 
Central Electoral Commission [CEC] distributed to the new 
deputies their mandates certifying their legal election to the 
Parliament. Tomorrow, after presenting its report in Parliament, 
the CEC will finish the activity, stated its president Nicolae 
Timofte. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM [Democratic Agrarian Party of 
Moldova] leader, told BASAPRESS that the first Parliamentary 
session will probably be opened by the most senior member, 
Artiom Lazarev (the Block of the Socialist Party and 
"Unitate-Edinstvo" Movement). First of all, the new 
Parliamentary Speaker, the Vice-Speakers and the permanent 
commissions will be titled; after that, the Parliamentary 
guidelines will be announced, said Motpan. Projects of the 
Constitution and of the special juridical status for the Eastern 
and Southern regions will be debated, along with economic 
questions. The PDAM will propose ex-speaker Petru Lucinschi for 
Speaker and for Premier, Andrei Sangheli, the present premier, 
said Motpan. Valeriu Senic, leader of the Socialist Party, 
declared to BASAPRESS that his faction has already proposed for 
the first session a draft decision for suspending the 
Governmental decision on the linguistic attestation. In Senic's 
view, priority will be given to the ratification of the CIS 
Economic Union document and to regional problems in Eastern and 
Southern Moldova. Alexandru Mosanu, leader of the Block of 
Peasants and Intellectuals, told BASAPRESS that his faction will 
insist on the adoption of a new agenda of the session reflecting 
the crucial priorities; such problems as the granting of a 
special status to Dniestr cannot be solved until after the 
ratification of the new Constitution. The concept proposed for 
the forming of the new parliament with the specification "13th 
since the first Supreme Soviet of Moldova" is inadmissible in 
principle, as the Parliament elected on Friday 27th is not a 
constitution of the Moldovan Socialist Soviet Republic Supreme 
Soviet. A basic task of the opposition will be the defense of 
democracy and liberties which have been established and the 
promotion of radical reforms, already being slowed now by forces 
that form the Parliamentary majority, said Mosanu. Lurie Rosca, 
leader of the Christian Democratic Popular Front, declared that 
his faction will demand from the very first session efficient 
actions for the release of deputy Ilie Ilascu. Rosca asserted 
that the Parliamentary and Governmental leadership will be 
"monochrome," and the opposition factions will be marginalized.

  [Text] Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan today received the 
U.S. Ambassador to Armenia Harry Gilmore, with whom he discussed 
economic issues. The improvement in the taxation system and 
American experts' assistance in this direction, the American 
contribution to spring agricultural work, and other problems 
were discussed. They also touched upon ways to find a political 
settlement to the Karabakh conflict. The CSCE Minsk Group and 
Russia's important efforts in this regard were stressed. 
  The prime minister also referred to the reoperation of the 
Armenian nuclear plant and to the position of the U.S. official 
organs. 
  The ambassador noted that those Americans opposing the 
reopening of the Armenian nuclear plant are not informed about 
the power situation in Armenia. They are worried that the 
safety of the nuclear plant is not up to the desired level 
therefore they will not assist with its reopening. 
  Gilmore handed Bagratyan a letter from the president of the 
International Organization of Science and Technology inviting 
Armenia to join the international organization.

  [Excerpts] The Armenian Defense Ministry press service 
informed us that they have no new information to add to the 
report issued this morning. According to this morning's report, 
the Azerbaijani Army fiercely bombarded Choratan, Artsvaberd, 
Movses, and Aygepar in Tavushskiy Rayon and the defensive 
positions around these villages with Grad rockets, tanks, and 
howitzers between 1650-1720 yesterday. The shelling caused 
destruction, deaths, and injuries. 
  The situation remained tense on the borders of Idzhevanskiy 
and Noyemberyanskiy rayons between 1830-2315. The Azerbaijani 
border troops fired towards Diran, Voskepar, and (?Sosi) using 
tanks, artillery, and infantry fighting vehicles. The shelling 
caused some injuries in Noyemberyanskiy. 
  This periodic aggression proves that, as a rule, Azerbaijan 
uses the relative calm on the Armenian borders to prepare for 
new border violations. 
  The Armenian Army's fighters had no choice but to retaliate 
in kind in all directions yesterday evening to force the 
Azerbaijanis stop the shelling. 
  The situation was calm on Armenia's borders during the night 
and this morning. [passage omitted] 
  Situation in Karabakh: After having suffered a major defeat 
in the direction of Agdam on eastern front yesterday, the 
Azerbaijani Army carried out a massive rocket and artillery 
bombardment of Karabakh positions in that sector this morning. 
The artillery shelling was still continuing at 0900. 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters press 
service reported that the Karabakh formations are taking 
countermeasures. 
  The situation was relatively calm on the remainder of the 
front.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin denied US media claims that Russian-US relations are 
"cooling down" and told US Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown on 
Wednesday that the relations are steadily developing along the 
course of partnership, cooperation and friendship. 
  The Russian leader noted that an important role in the issue 
is played by President Bill Clinton and personal contacts 
between the leaders of the two countries. 
  Yeltsin stressed that Russia and the United States have 
reached "good results" at the initial stage of trade and 
economic cooperation and called to further boost relations. 
  The Russian leader said Russia will actively participate in 
international labour division on a mutually beneficial basis.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F>
correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy 
Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] In keeping with the treaty between the USSR and the 
People's Democratic Republic of Korea Russia will help North 
Korea in the event of an unprovoked aggression, but will make 
the decision only on the basis of its own analysis of the 
situation. This was reported at a Tuesday briefing in Moscow by 
the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. 
  He described the current situation in the Korean peninsula 
as 
balancing on the brink of war. 
  In his opinion the recent Russian initiative to convene a 
conference of six interested countries (China, the USA, Japan, 
Russia and the two Koreas) and the United Nations and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency promotes a settlement in that 
part of the world. 
  The deputy minister stressed that Russia by no means 
questions the efforts of the UN Security Council or the IAEA. 
"However, the steps of the two organizations to normalize the 
situation in the Korean peninsula do not always produce the 
desired results", he remarked. 
  Panov announced that the Russian initiative is closely 
studied by all interested sides. "So far there have been no 
negative answers", he said. 
  In the opinion of the diplomat the conference should 
concentrate on making the peninsula a nuclear-free zone. He 
stressed that Russia and the USA agree that the conference 
should be well-prepared and discuss the membership of North 
Korea in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the observation 
of all safety regulations and a joint declaration of the two 
Koreas on a nuclear-free zone. 
  According to Panov, the conference could begin in Geneva and 
continue in Pyongyang and Seoul interchangeably. 
  The diplomat said that in the framework of organizing the 
conference it would be useful to hold preliminary unofficial 
consultations of all interested sides in Moscow. "It is 
absolutely unnecessary for everyone to sit at the same table. 
We understand that some participants would find it hard to 
communicate directly therefore we do not rule out the 
possibility of mediators", Panov said. 
  He added that a conference of six countries, representatives 
of the UN Secretary General and the General Director of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency is not the final format and 
the list of participants could be extended.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skosyrev report: "Beijing and Seoul Ignore </F>
Kozyrev Initiative"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who 
is ending his trip to China, will be going home empty-handed. 
At least as regards the DPRK's nuclear program, nothing came of 
the Sino-South Korean talks. 
  All Kim Yong-sam's attempts to persuade PRC President Jiang 
Zemin and the other Chinese leaders to exert pressure on 
Pyongyang came to nothing. 
  In response President Jiang reiterated the previous Chinese 
formula, which states that there is no point in transferring the 
issue of inspections of all North Korean nuclear installations 
to the UN Security Council, much less in taking sanctions 
against Pyongyang. 
  Moreover, referring to the U.S. intention to site Patriot 
missiles in the southern part of the peninsula and to resume the 
"Team Spirit" military maneuvers, the PRC leader said that such 
measures could only exacerbate tension still further. Jiang 
took the same tone on this issue as the DPRK Foreign Ministry, 
which has described the reinforcement of U.S. and South Korean 
forces as a step toward war. 
  While they found no common ground on the key subject of 
finding a way to resolve the present crisis, Beijing and Seoul 
were unanimous in ignoring Russia's proposal to convene an 
international conference on removing nuclear weapons from the 
peninsula. Neither side even mentioned the suggestion in their 
exchange of opinions. 
  The PRC president considered it necessary to stress that the 
nuclear problem should be resolved not at a conference but 
within the framework of quadrilateral talks between North and 
South Korea, the United States, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency.

  [Text] Seoul March 30 TASS -- South Korea has refused to 
accept the terms for a deferment of the repayment of Russia's 
debts on credits which the Seoul government had promised and 
partially provided for the former Soviet Union. Such is the 
outcome of Russian-South Korean talks which ended here on 
Wednesday. 
  At the same time, Mikhail Fradkov, Russian first deputy 
minister for foreign economic relations, who leads the Russian 
delegation at the talks, told ITAR-TASS that "the normal 
negotiating process is underway, and the negotiations will be 
continued". 
  Upon signing an agreement with the "Paris Club" of creditor 
countries in April last year on a rescheduling of the repayment 
of debts to the club member-states, Russia found itself in a 
situation in which it cannot settle with individual creditor 
countries, even non-members of club, including the Republic of 
Korea, on terms that would differ from those set by the Paris 
Club. 
  The Russian side tried to convince the Seoul government of 
the need to accept a debt repayment schedule comparable with the 
Paris Club terms but South Korean financial agencies have not 
agreed to that so far. 
  South Korea provided the Soviet Union with credits amounting 
to 1,470 million U.S. dollars of the promised 3,000 million 
dollars. Russia upon having confirmed the assumption of the 
former Soviet Union's international obligations, paid interest 
in cash and partially through the deliveries of aluminium ingots. 
  However, following the Paris Club's debt rescheduling 
decision, the repayment of Russia's debts to South Korea was 
suspended. The amount of overdue payments as of the end of 
February was about 449 million U.S. dollars.

<F P=106> [Boris Reznik report: "Top Secret Korean Facilities in </F>
Russian Taiga"] 
  [Text] Khabarovsk/Chegdomyn -- Rumors of slave labor and 
of DPRK citizens living in the Russian Far East without any 
rights have been doing the rounds for a long time now. It is 
hard to establish to what extent they are true and to what 
extent they are false: The heads of the Korean mission and the 
Korean security services (the latter are very active in the 
Siberian wastes on an entirely official basis) establish their 
own procedures there. For example, two women journalists from 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL and a South Korean television crew 
looking into the problem were snubbed as "emissaries of 
imperialism." Others were taken around "showcase facilities" 
which had been seen many times and had to listen to prepared 
texts about the happy citizens of their brilliant land being the 
freest people on earth. 
  Nonetheless, your IZVESTIYA correspondent managed to peep 
behind the scenes of the customary theater presentation. 
<H5>  How It All Began </H5>
  The first intergovernmental agreement between the USSR and 
the DPRK on joint timber logging on the territory of the Russian 
Far East was signed exactly 27 years ago, in March 1967. There 
was a great deal of politics in that agreement, but very little 
economics. 
  And although it was pure ideology, we turned a blind eye to 
the fact that the Korean comrades often behaved in a manner that 
was far from fraternal. Timber industry supervisors suddenly 
discovered that Korean workers were secretly chopping down 
trees, obtaining the resin, and sending it home. There were no 
agreements sanctioning this kind of activity. Local people and 
hunting inspectors were increasingly encountering blatant 
poaching by Korean loggers. They were using barbaric methods to 
kill musk deer, Manchurian elk, and sable and they were laying 
waste the celebrated mountain cranberries of Verkhnebureinskiy 
Rayon... 
  For the entire 27-year period the forest protection service 
has been keeping records of gross breaches of the forest 
management rules by Korean loggers. They fail to clear felling 
areas of leftover wood, they destroy new growth, and on only one 
occasion in all these years have they planted a small area with 
young trees.... 
  One wonders why in heaven's name we concluded the treaty in 
the first place. 
  North Koreans As Saviors of the Industry [subhead] 
  Strange as it may seem, the most zealous advocates of the 
extension of the intergovernmental agreement on joint DPRK and 
Russian timber logging in the Far East are the leaders of 
Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, where this predatory logging goes on. 
Their main argument is that, if the Koreans leave, the rayon's 
timber industry will soon die out because there is no one to 
take the place of the foreign state's citizens in this difficult 
taiga work. So I was told by rayon administration chief Petr 
Titkov, who was himself a timber worker in the recent past and 
worked for some years alongside Koreans in the "Urgalles" 
association, which represents the Russian side in joint activity 
under the intergovernmental agreement. 
  What economic foundation would Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon lose 
with the departure of the Koreans from the taiga forest lots? 
Last year the "Urgalles" association, through which all 
economic arrangements are made with the "Gastarbeiter" from 
North Korea, paid 1.5 billion rubles [R] in taxes into the 
federal, kray, and rayon budgets. Some R446 million remained in 
the rayon, which is one-tenth of all budget appropriations. A 
trifling amount of money these days. But clearly we cannot 
expect even that amount this year. This sad conclusion can be 
drawn from the results of the work of native loggers since the 
beginning of the year. 
  Their daily round wood production schedule is 4,548 cubic 
meters. But they are producing only 1,400-1,500 cubic meters 
per day. That is the amount being produced, for example, by the 
De-Kastrinskiy timber logging operation. It employs around 600 
Russian loggers, whereas the North Korean timber logging 
association employs over 6,000. 
  This answers the question why the rayon bosses are in favor 
of a treaty which places the country in bondage: A mass of 
problems far removed from the practice of joint timber logging 
is being resolved in Chegdomyn, Urgal, and Novyy Urgal by the 
almost free workforce from the DPRK. For example, Korean 
workers are constructing the Urgal railroach branch 
administration building, and local people hire them to dig truck 
gardens, repair apartments, erect garages, dachas, and barns... 
  "Our workers will fleece you real bad," a rather drunk 
"native" of Chegdomyn told us candidly, "whereas this bunch -- 
give them a bowl of soup each or a bottle of moonshine and, boy, 
will they work!" 
  Denial of Rights and the Rights of the Korean Individual 
[subhead] 
  ...It is a common sight in these parts: Emaciated people in 
short jackets and Kim Il-song caps, with "great leader" badges 
on their chests, roaming the streets of the settlements, 
tormented by the continual fear of starvation. Their silent 
suffering does not concern the local Russian officials one bit. 
The latter have no concept of the fact that it is a grave sin 
to exploit people who are dependent on you, taking cynical 
advantage of their dependence. If they have to explain 
themselves to their own or foreign journalists they have a pat 
formula: What we are doing is building relations with the North 
Koreans on a purely economic basis. As for delicate matters 
such as human rights, they are the Foreign Ministry's concern. 
  With the connivance of the kray and rayon authorities, North 
Korea has long since constructed its own strongholds, like 
states within a state, living in accordance with their own 
totalitarian laws. Remember 18 months ago, when photographs of 
prison cells erected behind the high fences of North Korean 
encampments were all over the Russian and foreign press? 
Runaway timber loggers told journalists about the sophisticated 
torture that went on there, about the severe punishments meted 
out for the slightest offense. 
  The North Korean security service is not only operating in 
Chegdomyn and Verkhnebureinskiy Rayon, but is rampaging all over 
Russia with impunity. For example, its officers carried out a 
search of a Russian woman's apartment in Khabarovsk, suspecting 
her of hiding a Korean who had run away from timber logging. 
  These patently illegal actions take place with the consent 
of 
our law-enforcement organs. Their DPRK colleagues evidently 
have some kind of agreement, the text of which is secret. All 
we do know is that our militia is helping the North Korean 
security service to catch runaways, who are increasing in 
numbers with each passing year. When caught they are 
immediately handed over to Korean "comrades," and what happens 
then is shrouded in mystery. There are currently more than 50 
people on the run. 
  There is one very worrying element: There has been a sharp 
fall in the amount of timber cut, while the Korean side is 
ordering more and more galvanized iron from "Urgalles" to make 
coffins for people killed in "accidents." Formerly any incident 
of this kind would have been carefully investigated by our 
technical experts and the findings of a forensic medical expert 
on the cause of death would have been required. Now the 
procedure has been "simplified": No examinations are carried 
out, the bodies are kept in a refrigerator, and they are then 
taken home in a special freightcar. 
  We made a considerable effort to arrange a visit to the 
North 
Korean hospital where loggers are treated, but our way was 
barred as if it were a top-secret strategic facility. V. 
Cherepanov, a surgeon from Chegdomyn hospital, who has access to 
the hospital, said that conditions in the "hospital" were 
squalid, to put it mildly: Water has to be brought in, the 
toilets are outside, the premises are primitive, are there are 
hardly any medicines.... 
  It should be borne in mind what kind of diet the citizens of 
the "brilliant land" have. A senior party official from the 
DPRK timber logging mission recited a long list of all the 
things their workers allegedly receive: Every month around five 
kg of meat, nearly 30 kg of rice and fresh vegetables each, 
fish.... Knowing that in Khabarovsk a kilogram of fresh 
cucumbers currently costs more than R5,000 and tomatoes around 
R10,000 and that in Chegdomyn the price is nearly twice as high 
as that, we wanted to know where the Korean comrades got the 
vegetables from. 
  "We have our own wonderful hothouses, which provide 
abundant crops," came the reply. 
  In Chegdomyn we learned that nothing had been grown in 
hothouses for two years and the Korean workers were not even 
getting their national dish -- "kimchi," highly seasoned cabbage 
-- and their diet consisted of rice alone.... 
  ...The intergovernmental agreement on joint timber logging 
in 
the Russian Far East between our country and the DPRK expired on 
31 December. So far a new one has not been signed. But if it 
is considered economically expedient to continue thos 
cooperation, our country, which loudly proclaims itself 
democratic, is simply obliged to stop foreigners doing whatever 
they like on our fatherland's territory.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan is convinced that successful 
development of the peoples inhabiting the former Soviet Union is 
possible only through their uniting into a new alliance. 
  Nazarbayev, who met Russian media chiefs on Wednesday 
morning, emphasised that he had long been nurturing the idea and 
that Boris Yeltsin was the first to hear his considerations. "It 
is just impossible for us to make progress without such an 
alliance," Nazarbayev said. 
  "I have always been an advocate of a close union. The 
economies of ex-Soviet republics are closely inter-connected. 
The euphoria of sovereignties is over, and ex-soviet states are 
coming to realise that we all need one another", the president 
of Kazakhstan said. 
  Nazarbayev gave the following particular example: Russia's 
submarine fleet is catered for by about 40 enterprises from 
"landlocked" Kazakhstan. Inter-dependence is great whatever the 
branch of industry, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Nazarbayev said, unnecessary customs barriers are 
being installed. Russia has set up 65 customs points at the 
border with Kazakhstan at a time when Kazakhstan does not 
consider it necessary to take similar measures. 
  The president of Kazakhstan believes that much will change 
for the better following his visit to Moscow and his talks with 
Boris Yeltsin. "The strategic policy of partnership has been 
sealed. Abiding by it, we shall enter the 21st Century," he 
stated. 
  Media chiefs wondered why Nazarbayev came forward with the 
Euro-Asian Union (EAU) idea without being content with the 
existence of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  "The CIS is in existence but we get farther and farther away 
from one another," he said. Four hundred documents have been 
signed but they all do not work, he added. 
  The president of Kazakhstan believes that supranational 
bodies are essential for integration to really [be] effective. 
He was confirmed in this belief once again during his recent 
trip to Western Europe. 
  It is necessary to have a supernational [as received] 
parliament and such bodies as a defence ministers' council, a 
foreign ministers' council, an inter-state secretariat, which 
would see to it that the accords reached are implemented. It 
would be also useful to set up a council for education and 
culture and a common information agency. 
  Nazarbayev visualises a Euro-Asian union as a voluntary 
association of states, with a supranational currency, an 
inter-state investment fund, and a common programme for economic 
reforms. The language of inter-nation intercourse in the 
contemplated EAU must be Russian. And "there should be no 
associated members", the president added. 
  Asked about the future of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test 
site, Nazarbayev said no tests would be conducted there any 
longer. Five hundred nuclear detonations over a span of forty 
years turned the land there into a scorched desert, he remarked. 
  As far as the Baykonur Cosmodrome is concerned, the 
president 
recalled that appropriate Russian-Kazakshtan accords had been 
reached. "The main thing is to keep the cosmodrome for joint 
use. As far as money is concerned, we reached agreement on 
acceptable terms," he said. 
  In response to complaints by Russian newspaper editors that 
their publications encounter distribution difficulties in 
Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev promised that the arisen problems would 
be settled. "We are interested in the existence of Russian 
newspapers in Kazakhstan," he assured.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASs -- Russian Federation Council 
speaker Vladimir Shumeyko, during a meeting with journalists, 
supported the proposal made by Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev to establish a Euro-Asian union. Shumeyko considers 
it possible to establish such a union on a new basis, not just 
recreate the former Soviet Union. 
  Shumeyko's opinion is that it is possible to create a new 
union on the basis of the already existing CIS institutions: 
The Council of the Heads of State, the Council of the Heads of 
Government, and the Interparliamentary Assembly. 
  He also believes that it is essential gradually to establish 
"supranational institutions which would administer such a 
union." One can speak about the creation of common armed forces, 
a common monetary system and that there is no need for borders, 
Shumeyko remarked, being of the opinion that it is time to moot 
these ideas in society. 
  Speaking about his recent visit to France, the Federation 
Council speaker pointed out that he had been particularly 
gratified by the trip to Strasbourg and the decision on Russia's 
accession to the Council of Europe. 
  Shumeyko announced that a peace-making group of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly, led by Kyrgyzstan parliament chief 
Medetkan Sherimkulov, leaves Moscow for the Transcaucasus on 
Thursday. The delegation will include representatives from a 
number of CIS countries and the Russian Federation Council 
committees.

  [Text] The chairman of the Russian Community of North 
Kazakhstan has strongly criticized Kazakhstan's policy towards 
its Russian-speaking population. 
  Boris Suprugin, addressing the Russian president's 
commission 
on citizenship on Tuesday, urged Moscow to take action against 
what he qualified as discrimination against Russian speakers and 
to link Russia's economic assistance to Kazakhstan to this 
problem. 
  He also insisted that the Russian government press for dual 
citizenship for North Kazakhstan's Russian-speaking community, 
which accounts for about 80 percent of the region's population, 
and for Russian speakers throughout Kazakhstan. Since the 
Kazakh government refused to allow Russia to open its consulates 
in Kazakhstan, Suprugin asked the Russian Foreign Ministry to 
set up consulates in Russian regions bordering on the Central 
Asian republic to make it easier for its ethnic Russians to 
receive Russian citizenship. 
  Suprugin demanded an official status for Kazakhstan's 
Cossack 
community to make it "a state structure that would make it 
possible to keep on tenterhooks states which violate the rights 
of their Russian population." 
  He said Russia should not have signed with Kazakhstan an 
agreement to lease from it the Baykonur spacecraft-launching 
complex for $115 Mn, for the complex had been built at Russia's 
expense. He expressed the apprehension that a similar agreement 
would be made on the 200-km section of the Trans-Siberian 
Railway running through Kazakhstan.

<F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko article: "Problem of Baykonur Declared </F>
Solved. Will It Be Able To Survive?"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 28 March, when a reception was 
held for Kazakhstani President N. Nazarbayev in the Kremlin with 
all the honors befitting the leader of a sovereign state, one 
could hardly have expected a significant breakthrough in 
Russian-Kazakhstani relations, which have over the last few 
months noticeably cooled, primarily owing to the acute 
disagreements over the future of the Baykonur Cosmodrome. 
  However, that very same evening, even before the package of 
around two dozen documents had been signed, it became clear that 
B. Yeltsin and N. Nazarbayev had succeeded in eliminating the 
mutual bones of contention -- of which there had been plenty 
during the lengthy talks between experts and the leaders of the 
Ministry of the Economy and the Foreign Ministry -- and adopted 
a determined decision which promises to prolong the life of the 
unique space rocket complex. 
  What happened during the eight-hour talks in Moscow? Why did 
Nazarbayev so rapidly abandon the excessive claims that Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] had put forward during the negotiating marathon? There 
is every indication that the solution should be sought in a 
practice that has become traditional for experienced 
politicians: Ask for as much as possible and get as much as you 
can. 
  By the time the Kazakhstani delegation arrived in Moscow the 
set of documents prepared by the various departments looked like 
this. The heads of state were to discuss and sign treaties on 
military cooperation, on deepening economic integration between 
the two countries, and on the basic principles for resolving 
matters of granting dual citizenship, as well as, of course, the 
agreement on the basic principles for the use of the Baykonur 
Cosmodrome. 
  The heads of government were to settle questions of 
collaboration in the field of military-technical cooperation and 
the servicing and maintenance of the strategic nuclear forces, 
and also to finally make joint efforts to remove a nuclear 
device left in a silo at the Semipalatinsk test site following 
its closure. According to one participant in the talks, these 
and other draft documents did not give rise to particular 
dispute. The Baykonur draft, which was submitted to the 
presidents in a very "raw" form, remained the thorn in the 
flesh. And not because the experts were unable to reach 
agreement. They had been given mutually exclusive paramaters 
for the cost of leasing the cosmodrome. Moreover, the 
cosmodrome is doomed without the city of Leninsk, without the 
Russian specialists living there. But Russian citizens cannot 
live and work normally in this city, which is under Kazakhstan's 
jurisdiction, unless the legal status of Russian specialists in 
this country is defined. 
  The situation at the talks changed dramatically straight 
after the two presidents had a one-on-one conversation lasting 
roughly an hour. In his introductory address to the delegations 
Yeltsin said: "There were some questions over the documents, 
but we have settled them...." Soon many participants in the 
talks on both sides began leaving the Kremlin. It turned out 
that they were going off to the Finance Ministry and the 
Ministry of the Economy since the presidents had given them 
strict instructions: Coordinate your positions within six hours 
so that the Russian side's leasing of Baykonur becomes a reality. 
  Economy Minister A. Shokhin described the gist of the draft 
during a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent. The 
term of the cosmodrome lease is to run for 20 years. The amount 
of rent proposed by the Russian side must not exceed $82 
million, which has already been enshrined in this year's budget. 
(Yu. Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency, 
cited a figure of $105-150 million). As for the city of 
Leninsk, Russia cannot fund it with the present number of 
inhabitants -- around 150,000 people. We may be talking about 
40,000 specialists and members of their families. The 
Kazakhstani authorities are also to participate in funding the 
city. Needless to say, all these problems cannot be settled in 
six hours. Therefore some of them will be postponed until 
Yeltsin's visit to Alma-Ata, which will most likely take place 
this May. He received an invitation to that effect from 
Nazarbayev. 
  After the joint document signing ceremony the presidents 
told 
journalists in unison that Baykonur will survive. "We had no 
political disagreements. There were just technical 
difficulties," Yeltsin said. Foreign Minister A. Kozyrev 
described the latter in an interview with your IZVESTIYA 
correspondent. The idea that has been around for some time of 
dividing up the cosmodrome and handing it over to an 
international company (the information "leak" about the creation 
of a Kazakhstani-Ukrainian company was most likely arranged with 
this in mind -- author's note) rapidly collapsed. And there is 
no need to look for intrigues on the part of the military here. 
Everyone who has studied the problem realizes that the 
cosmodrome is unviable without Russia. It must remain a unified 
complex. 
  "In other words, Nazarbayev had no other options?" I asked. 
  "I would say this: Kazakhstan is not the loser here," the 
minister replied. "Preserving the cosmodrome boosts that 
state's status. What is more, we will be paying to use it. And 
there is no one else to pay. U.S. launch technology, for 
instance, simply cannot be reconciled with ours." 
  The saga of the rescue of Baykonur has been declared over, 
but it is too early to draw a line under it. Remember that it 
was decided in Massandra to buy out the Ukrainian part of the 
Black Sea Fleet. But nothing has budged an inch.

  [Text] The Russian president's commission on citizenship 
has drawn up proposals for Russia's policy on ethnic Russians 
living in other former Soviet republics. 
  The commission suggests that guarantees of the rights of 
Russians permanently resident in countries of the former Soviet 
Union be formalized in accords between Russia and each such 
state. The same policy, the commission suggests, should be used 
to ensure the rights of people from such states who live in 
Russia. The commission will recommend that the president issue 
a decree to that effect, Abdulakh Mikitayev, head of the 
commission, said at its meeting on Tuesday. 
  Mikitayev said the Soviet Union's disintegration had left 
about 50 Mn people, including 30 Mn Russians, outside their 
historic homelands. He said many of them wished to go back and 
that there were increasing numbers of refugees. 
  The commission says, in a document containing its proposals, 
that ethnic Russians' basic rights were being violated in some 
of the former Soviet republics. Latvia and Estonia, for 
instance, do not give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of 
their residents, thereby restricting their voting and property 
rights and making their actual right to live in those countries 
problematic. 
  The commission suggests dual citizenship for such people, 
something the Russian law makes provision for, Mikitayev said. 
He said Turkmenistan is so far the only state with which Russia 
has a dual citizenship agreement. The commission also proposes 
that Russian continue to be used in contacts between different 
ex-Soviet states. Russia needs a special economic policy to put 
those proposals into practice, the commission believes. 
  Federal Migration Service (FMS) chief Tatyana Regent said 
Moscow should provide stronger protection for ethnic Russians' 
economic interests in order not to "receive them impoverished" 
if they choose to return to Russia. 
  She said one serious problem was illegal migration, which 
was 
the target of a presidential decree of December 16, 1993. To 
carry out the decree, the FMS was setting up an immigration 
control service, Regent said.

  [Text] Over the past years 356,000 ethnic Russians have 
emigrated from Central Asian republics to the Russian 
Federation. In particular, 120,000 left Kazakhstan, 106,000 -- 
Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan], 90,000 -- Uzbekistan. Russian Minister 
of Nationalities and Regional Policy Sergey Shakhray gave these 
figures during his meeting in Moscow on Tuesday with CSCE 
Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minorities Max van der Stoel. 
  After the meeting Shakhray told Interfax that he had 
informed 
the guest about the reasons for the migration of ethnic Russians 
from Central Asian countries. Thus, statistical data show that 
28 percent explained the return to their historical homeland 
with "the real threat of violence or persecution," and 19 
percent with "insult and humililation of national dignity." 
  In the minister's opinion, if the situation for ethnic 
Russians does not impove in this region, within the next two or 
three years the migration of 3 million people can be expected 
from the Central Asian republics to the Russian Federation. 
  The situation with 11 million ethnic Russians living in 
Ukraine is also complicated. According to Shakhray, the main 
problems there are "the exclusion of the Russian language from 
the daily life and business, "the Ukrainization" of education in 
high schools, the obligatory knowledge of the Ukrainian language 
for getting a profession." Shakhray noted that in Ukraine, like 
in other republics of the former Soviet Union, the share of 
unemployed ethnic Russians is "inadmissibly large." 
  Regarding the situation of the Russian-speaking population 
in 
the Baltic states, Shakhray said that after the parliaments of 
these states adopted corresponding laws, 300,000 ethnic Russians 
living in Estonia were deprived of citizenship. In Latvia 
700,000 Russians lost citizenship, of them 160,000 have no legal 
status at all, including the right to work. 
  Shakhray stated that Russia as a legal successor of the 
Soviet Union has taken all responsibility for those people who 
"hold only the USSR passport." 
  The minister believes that a multilateral convention within 
the framework of the CIS should be signed to assure the rights 
of ethnic minorities and that on the basis of this document 
bilateral treaties must be concluded. In his opinion, apart 
from that it would also be necessary to establish efficient 
control over the observance of these documents. 
  Shakhray said that at the meeting with Max van der Stoel it 
was agreed to expand cooperation in the protection of interests 
of ethnic minorities and in the more efficient use of 
international mechanisms on this issue.

  [Text] Bucharest March 29 TASS -- All European states must 
help ensure European security, there should not be masters to 
control their servants in future, Russian Defence Minister 
General of Army Pavel Grachev told correspondents upon the 
completion of his meeting with Romanian President Ion Iliescu. 
  In his words, the sides discussed aspects of foreign policy 
and partnership with Western Europe and the United States, and 
revealed similarity and peculiarities in their approaches to 
partnership with other states. They agreed that partnership 
should have an equal mutually beneficial basis and include 
neither tutors nor pupils. 
  The sides agreed that Russian and Romanian development has 
much in common. The Romanian state head said he favors closer 
cooperation with Russia, is looking forward to a meeting with 
Boris Yeltsin and hopes the meeting will be held this year. 
  Russia is also striving to consolidate comprehensive 
relations with Romania which, unfortunately, have been somewhat 
suspended, said Grachev. 
  Today's meeting of the Russian defence minister and Romanian 
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu stressed the importance for 
boosted bilateral relations. The resumption and expansion of 
bilateral relations and the use of years-long experience under 
new conditions corresponds to the interests of both states, said 
the Romanian premier. 
  In his turn, Grachev voiced the need for boosted relations 
in 
all spheres and praised the signed agreement on military 
cooperation, which provides for Russian training of Romanian 
officers, joint military exercises and exchange of specialists. 
The planned interaction in the defence industry, especially 
conversion, is of much interest as well. 
  The Russian delegation has left for the area of Ploiesti to 
attend tactical drill of a mechanized armed unit and visit the 
Peles King palace in the Carpathian town of Sinaia.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Morozov] </F>
  [Text] Bucharest March 30 TASS -- "In principle Romania 
has reconsidered its attitude towards Russia and is seeking to 
develop cooperation with it in all spheres," Russian Defence 
Minister Pavel Grachev said upon the completion of his three-day 
visit to Romania. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Grachev said 
that the trip had been postponed twice. "When I was flying here 
I expected to see restraint and hear traditional phrases instead 
of words about closer contacts," he said. "However pretty soon, 
mostly on the initiative of the Romanian side, there were no 
doubts about the need for my visit left, all our neighbours 
stressed that despite the long stagnation in bilateral relations 
Romania is ready to develop equal and mutually beneficial ties 
with Russia," the minister said. 
  Relations between the armed forces of the two countries 
broke 
up after the conflict in the Dniester Republic, Grachev 
continued. Now Romanian partners have shown that they have 
changed their views. "During the talks none of our partners 
tried to raise the question about the situation in Moldova. 
This is a real turn -- not to connect our bilateral relations 
with the situation in a third country. The situation in Moldova 
is the internal affair of that independent state and its leaders 
will settle it on their own," he said. 
  The key question of Russian-Romanian military relations is 
cooperation in the military and technical sphere. The 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact has severed traditional ties 
between the two countries. The bulk of machinery and equipment 
now used by the Romanian Army was made in the Soviet Union. 
Some spare parts could be produced in Romania, but the majority 
of them have to be supplied from Russia. Now that Romanian and 
Russian defence departments signed an agreement on cooperation, 
Romanian plants which have been making spare parts for obsolete 
military equipment will switch to civilian production, others 
will be modernised with Russia's assistance. 
  Romania was the first to have joined the Partnership for 
Peace programme and made no secret of its intention to 
eventually join NATO, Grachev noted. "President (Ion) Iliescu 
told me that Romania calls for integration into NATO with all 
other countries simultaneously, including Russia. The head of 
the Romanian state foresees the transformation of that 
military-political alliance into a military-peace-making union. 
Moreover, the president of Romania prioritises partnership not 
so much in the military as in the economic sphere," he added. 
  Many former Warsaw Pact countries consider the Partnership 
for Peace programme as a stage towards full integration with 
NATO. This is a very long process which will go gradually. Now 
these countries are not ready to enter NATO and this 
transitional period may last eight to ten years, according to 
various estimates. 
  "As for Russia, we will not integrate into the structures of 
the North Atlantic Alliance. One of the reasons is that it is 
impossible to adjust Russian nuclear missiles to NATO standards. 
Russia is a great power and it has a great Army with powerful 
modern weapons. That's why we stand for close cooperation, but 
the Partnership for Peace programme is not a transitional stage 
for us," Grachev said. 
  "Fears that this programme may hamper the establishment of 
new military structures within the CIS are groundless," the 
minister continued. "There are certain circles in Russia which 
have never stopped considering Western countries, let alone 
NATO, as an enemy. It is they who claim that Russia is allegedly 
being involved in NATO structures and that NATO will soon govern 
Russia. This will never happen. We can exist on our own and 
resist any bloc, including NATO, if the need arises. It is time 
to stop frightening our people with American and NATO threat," 
he said. 
  In a separate statement made at a news conference in 
Bucharest, Grachev said that Russian troops will act as 
peace-keeping forces in the former Soviet Union, pending a 
respective resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Russian 
troops will be deployed in a republic only with consent of its 
leaders and will act in conjunction with the troops of that 
republic to prevent bloodsheds. 
  At present, 15,000 Russian troops are engaged in 
peace-keeping operations. The issue is expected to be discussed 
during U.N. Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali's upcoming 
visit to Moscow in April.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Maryukha report: "`Pomor-94': `War' From </F>
Briefing to Briefing. Joint Exercises by Forces From Five 
Navies Have Been Completed in North Atlantic; Cooperation Is 
Continuing"] 
  [Text] Nowadays few would be surprised by Russia's 
military cooperation with powers which it once opposed. 
Something else would surprise a number of people: Despite all 
the difficulties it is experiencing, the Russian Navy is by no 
means playing second fiddle in this embryonic partnership. 
  The colors of the participants' flags in the "Pomor-94" 
exercises were identical -- red, white, and blue. But the 
interests of the countries which have now sent their ships to 
the North Atlantic used to be as different as the design of 
their flags. Today they have more and more interests in common 
and increasing grounds for cooperation. The fact that the 
world's oceans are becoming safer in advance of other regions 
was confirmed by the "Pomor-94" exercises, which took place 
without a shot being fired. 
  During this exercise six ships -- two from Norway and one 
each from the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, and the 
Russian escort ship Legkiy from the Northern Fleet -- practiced 
tasks involving joint maneuvers, search and rescue of those in 
distress, coordination of operations with patrol aircraft back 
at base, and coastal blockades with the aim of preventing 
smuggling. The phrase "for the first time" may be applied to 
these exercises in many ways, not least because this is the 
first time such maneuvers have ever been held. It is also 
remarkable that for the first time a Russian military journalist 
traveled on board a Norwegian ship during exercises on this 
scale. And the fact that Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy 
commander in chief of the Navy, participated in the exercises 
made them important enough for the Norwegian defense minister to 
attend as well. 
  The "Pomor-94" exercises started and finished with news 
conferences by leaders and organizers of this new round of 
marine cooperation. The Norwegian Admiral Ove Sten Olsen, who 
was in charge of the exercise campaign headquarters, spoke 
highly of the Russian sailors and noted that cooperation of this 
sort would also be planned in future. In reply, Admiral Igor 
Kasatonov announced that the Russian Navy is this year planning 
to participate in a number of other similar joint exercises, 
including the landing of a Russian-U.S. assault force near 
Vladivostok. Next year the Russian Northern Fleet plans to host 
the "Pomor" exercises combined squadron.

<F P=106> [Maksim Yusin article: "Ukrainian Elections Reveal </F>
Dangerous Trend: Regions Are Pulling Different Ways"] 
  [Text] The Ukrainian parliamentary elections and a poll in 
Crimea which was conducted despite being banned by Kiev 
confirmed the worst fears regarding the Ukraine of the future. 
  Although most electoral districts still face a second round 
and the names of the new Supreme Council deputies will at best 
be known 10 April, two conclusions can be drawn now. 
  The first is that today the republic is to all intents and 
purposes split. On the one hand, the western oblasts are the 
bastion of Ukrainian "independence," where most voters voted for 
Rukh and other "patriotic" movements. On the other hand, you 
have the east, which leans toward Russia and where candidates 
advocating rapprochement with Moscow celebrated their success. 
The results of a poll conducted in Donetsk Oblast showed the 
mood of inhabitants of the eastern regions today. According to 
preliminary figures, 87 percent of the oblast's residents were 
in favor of Russian being recognized as the second official 
language and 85 percent were in favor of Ukraine fully entering 
into an economic union with Russia. 
  Both these demands are unacceptable to the 
"national-democratic" parties which won a decisive victory in 
the west of the republic. There is a real threat that the future 
parliament, torn between two irreconcilable political forces, 
will be unviable. Rukh leader Vyacheslav Chornovil stated 
unequivocally that he will be unable to find a common language 
with former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who is "entirely 
Russia-oriented." However, it is Kuchma who is deemed the 
favorite in the coming presidential elections. He confirmed his 
popularity 27 March: In Chernigov Oblast, which borders Russia, 
Kuchma's candidacy won the support of over 90 percent of the 
voters. 
  The second conclusion concerns Crimea. Eighty percent of the 
peninsula's inhabitants who took part in the poll of the 
population answered "yes" to two questions that Leonid Kravchuk 
has declared unconstitutional. As Kiev feared, the people of 
Crimea voted in favor of dual citizenship (Ukrainian and Russia) 
and greater autonomy from Ukraine. 
  The outcome of the ballot not only threatens a fresh crisis 
between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities but may well 
affect relations between Moscow and Kiev. [Crimean] President 
Yuriy Meshkov is making no secret of his plans: Based on the 
will of the people he will demand that the Crimean parliament 
adopt the appropriate laws. Aware that Kiev takes an extremely 
adverse view of this, the Crimean president is deliberately 
heading for a conflict, relying "on himself, on his 
administration, and the help of the Black Sea Fleet." 
  For their part Ukrainian radicals are urging Kravchuk to use 
force to impose order on the peninsula. And although the 
Ukrainian president will hardly take their advice, the threat of 
armed confrontation is looming large. Especially if the Black 
Sea Fleet responds to Meshkov's appeals and backs him in 
violation of the Russo-Ukrainian accords. It is no coincidence 
that in a recent television interview Kravchuk spoke of the 
possibility of another Karabakh. 
  Russian diplomats are giving assurances that Moscow's plans 
do not include exacerbating the situation in the Crimea. Russia 
is primarily interested in Kiev's nuclear disarmament, which may 
be suspended if a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity 
arises. On the eve of the Crimean poll the Russian authorities 
took an emphatically neutral stance, reluctant to interfere in 
the sovereign state's domestic affairs. Nevertheless events are 
largely developing contrary to Kiev's wishes. No matter how 
Yeltsin and Kozyrev urge restraint on Meshkov, the Crimean 
president is considerably closer in spirit to other Russian 
politicians. It is no coincidence, according to REUTER, that in 
one of his interviews he spoke of his enthusiastic view of 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  If the crisis in Ukraine worsens while relative stability at 
least is preserved in Russia, separatist aspirations will 
receive a fresh boost -- and not just in Crimea. In that case 
Moscow may find itself involved against its own wishes in the 
maelstrom of events in the neighboring country. And even if 
Yeltsin takes a moderate stance, it is unlikely that the Duma, 
dominated by communists and nationalists, will resist the 
temptation to play the Crimean card and, in the future, the 
Donetsk, Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk cards.... 
  A foreign diplomat accredited in Moscow admitted that during 
private conversations Russian officials have already begun 
testing the water in an endeavor to find out how the West would 
regard the dismemberment of Ukraine. At the moment these 
hypotheses are no more than that. At any rate Yeltsin's 
entourage has no intention of forcing the process. Annexing the 
Crimea would not improve the economic situation in Russia and 
would hardly strengthen its international position. The Russian 
Federation itself has enough trouble spots, is it worth adding 
another? 
  The Kremlin has opted for wait-and-see tactics with regard 
to 
Ukraine, weighing up all the "pros" and "cons" and leaving the 
Kiev authorities themselves to unravel knots that are growing 
tighter by the day.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, 30 Mar -- The two-year military 
confrontation between the Croats and the Serbs from Krajina has 
come to an end. At 0430, following 17 hours of difficult talks 
in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, an agreement was signed 
envisaging a cease-fire and the withdrawal of weapons and troops 
from the demarcation line in the areas of Croatia under UN 
control. In accordance with the document, which comes into 
effect on 0900 on 4 April, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn 20 
km, light weapons 10 km, and troops 1,000 meters away from the 
300-km long demarcation line. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vitaliy 
Churkin, representative of the Russian Federation president, 
stressed the high degree of coordination of the actions of the 
key members of the international community taking part in the 
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis -- Russia, the United States, 
the European Union, and the United Nations. At key moments in 
the talks, representatives of these countries and organizations 
acted from united positions, making it possible to nudge the 
sides in the direction of accords. This was an extremely 
important experience of Russo-American interaction in tackling 
complex critical problems. It could be said that the preparation 
of the Serb-Croat agreement would be a good model for continuing 
work on other aspects of the Yugoslav settlement, Vitaliy 
Churkin stressed. 
  The Zagreb agreement is of very great significance for the 
normalization of Serb-Croat relations. We expect that in two 
weeks' time there should follow a similar Serb-Croat meeting on 
economic questions, connected with vital supplies for the 
regions under UN control and adjacent territories. Then it will 
be possible to gradually go over to tackling the most difficult 
questions concerning their political status, Vitaliy Churkin 
said. 
  The high-ranking Russian diplomat recalled that the UN 
Security Council resolution extending the mandate of 
peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia stipulates the 
possibility of air support for the "blue helmets" in case of 
attacks. Since the UN troops are stationed on territories 
controlled by the Serbs, who have repeatedly been attacked by 
the Croatian side, this provision serves as a certain guarantee 
that incidents of this sort will be avoided in the future. 
Russia has its own interests here, since its peacekeeping 
battalion is deployed in one of these areas, and we want the 
interests of its safety to be met, V. Churkin noted. 
  The Russian Federation president's special envoy did not 
rule 
out the possibility that the next round of Serb-Croat talks on 
economic issues will also be held in the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Svartsevich report under the "Peacekeeping" </F>
rubric: "Reinforcement for Russian Battalion. Russian Blue 
Helmets Off to the Balkans"] 
  [Text] A send-off ceremony for a peacekeeping contingent 
of the Russian Armed Forces leaving for Yugoslavia was held at a 
military airfield in Ryazan. One-hundred strong, young 
volunteer servicemen comprising a staff company are to reinforce 
the 629th infantry battalion. Among them are men of 10 
nationalities and religious faiths. 
  The volunteer airborne troops servicemen, according to the 
edict of the president and government of Russia, will be 
carrying out a peacekeeping mission in a world hotspot. 
  As Major General Nikolay Staskov, deputy commander of the MP 
[expansion unknown] of the airborne troops noted, the staff 
company includes a platoon of Muslim servicemen. This is being 
done at the request of the Russian Foreign Ministry in order to 
increase trust in our mission. In April, 200 more Russian 
peacekeepers will be sent to the East sector. Thus, the 
strength of our peacekeeping forces will be brought to 1,000 men. 
  As the airborne troops commanders have stated, Russian 
peacekeeping servicemen are paid $800 to $1,000 as before. The 
government of Russia will soon make a decision on raising the 
allowance. First of all it envisions the payment of a second 
allowance in rubles in Russia and a number of other benefits, 
especially in social protection. For example, one year of 
service in Yugoslavia or in hotspots around the CIS will go on 
record as three years.

  [Text] Iraq should take more energetic steps to carry out 
the unimplemented demands of the international community. Only 
this will open up prospects for breaking the international 
isolation of Baghdad. The statement was made at a Tuesday 
briefing in Moscow by the official spokesman for the Russian 
Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. 
  According to him, Moscow has taken notice of the report of 
the UN Security Council Commission for the Disarmament of Iraq 
saying that the destruction of the Iraqi arsenal of chemical 
weapons is entering the final stage. The Commission Chairman 
Ralph Ekeus said that by now the bulk of chemical weapons has 
been scrapped and the necessary barriers have been built for the 
prevention of their production in the future. 
  "On the whole, this can be considered as additional 
confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with the United 
Nations in implementing Security Council resolutions on the 
Persian Gulf. Such changes in the Iraqi approach should be 
encouraged. The call was made by the Russian ambassador to the 
United Nations during a recent Security Council debate on 
anti-Iraqi sanctions," Karasin said. 
  In his opinion, to prevent the possibility of the 
reconstruction of the Iraqi military potential, the mechanism of 
long-term monitoring should be launched as soon as possible and 
a trial period declared to check its efficiency.

  [Excerpts] Simferopol, Ukraine, 29 March (AFP) -- Ukraine 
must give Crimea a large degree of economic autonomy if it wants 
to avoid a conflict with its autonomous Republic on the Black 
Sea, a Russian official said here. 
  "To put pressure on Crimea could cause an explosion. For 
Ukraine, there is only one outcome, that is to offer Crimea the 
widest possible scope in the economic domain," Konstantin 
Zatulin told a press conference here. [passage omitted] 
  Zatulin is chairman of the committee in charge of relations 
with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Duma 
(lower house of parliament). 
  Zatulin insisted that "Russia has never played and never 
will 
play the Crimean card," but "it is impossible not to take into 
account Russia's special interests in Crimea." [passage omitted] 
  "We are working from the principle of Ukraine's 
(territorial) 
integrity, but Crimea and certain Ukrainian regions are de facto 
very close to Russia," Zatulin said. 
  On the thorny question of the Black Sea fleet, which has 
poisoned relations between Kiev and Moscow for the past two 
years, Zatulin said to share the fleet was "an absurd idea." 
  "After talking to the sailors, I know that no decision on 
sharing the fleet would be implemented by the military," he 
said. "We must carry on working on the basis of the treaty of 
Massandra." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 29 Mar, TASS -- Last Sunday, the Crimeans 
were taking part not only in the Ukrainian and their own 
parliamentary elections, but also in an opinion poll on some 
important political issues of the peninsula. 
  It is necessary to point out that on the eve of the 
elections 
some political parties and movements called on the Crimeans to 
stay away from the Ukrainian parliamentary elections or, to be 
more exact, not to drop the ballots into the ballot-boxes, but 
take them away. 
  It is not known yet whether the voters paid their attention 
to this call or not, but it was already stated that the Crimean 
parliamentary elections are recognized valid because more than 
60 percent of the electorate took part in the elections (the 
needed number is 50 percent). 
  In accordance with the preliminary data, the "Russia" 
election bloc, which nominated Yuriy Meshkov for the presidency, 
and representatives of the Communist Party are in the lead. 
  The opinion poll, which was conducted on the initiative of 
President Meshkov, known for his pro-Russian sentiments, 
consisted of three questions: Should the Crimea establish its 
relations with Ukraine on the basis of agreements, whether the 
people support the idea of the dual citizenship and whether they 
agree to attach force of law to some decrees by the Crimean 
president. 
  The poll's idea caused a negative reaction in Kiev and the 
Crimean Central Electoral Commission did not participate in its 
organizing. The poll, which is considered a sociological study, 
was conducted by the presidential structures of the peninsula. 
  A group of international observers at the Ukrainian and 
Crimean parliamentary elections held a press-conference on 
Monday. "We did not register any violations of the Crimean 
election legislation or the international election law," Sergey 
Stankevich, Russia's State Duma deputy, told journalists.

  [Text] Sevastopol [no date as received] -- Rear Admiral 
Oleksiy Ryzhenko, chief of staff and deputy commander of 
Ukraine's Navy, said in an interview with UNIAN on 28 March that 
"statements about the Black Sea Fleet's power are nothing but a 
myth and deception of the people." According to him, the Black 
Sea Fleet is equipped with outdated rocket weaponry of the 
former USSR, some of which is no longer produced by the 
industry. In the past seven to 10 years, scheduled maintenance 
of the rocket artillery weapons has not been performed, and only 
emergency repairs and renovations have been conducted. The 
average age of the ships is 15-20 years, and no money has been 
allocated lately for their servicing. No new ships have been 
added to the Black Sea Fleet in the past few years, while 
modernization and reequipment of the existing ships, considering 
their old age, does not look justifiable. According to Oleksiy 
Ryzhenko, [words indistinct] five submarines, 20 auxiliary 
vessels, and five special task ships of the Black Sea Fleet are 
currently being repaired at Ukraine's shipyards. Another 77 
ships and vessels are due to be sent for repair. 
  The rear admiral said that the intensity and quality of 
combat training has suffered a drop for a number of reasons, 
while "the occasional appearance of 20-25 ships does not prove 
the power or combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet. One 
cannot seriously say that this fleet is a guarantor of CIS 
security," Oleksiy Ryzhenko believes.

  [Text] Sevastopol 29 Mar, TASS -- The command of the 
Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet has demanded that the Ukrainian 
Army pay its debts for electric power supplies and construction 
works provided by the fleet. 
  A message sent Tuesday to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy mentioned that the Ukrainian Army debts to the fleet 
amounted to 20 billion karbovanets (about 0.6 million dollars). 
  In case the debts are not settled before 10 April, the 
command will consider abandoning all construction works at the 
Ukrainian military sites and cutting off power supplies for the 
units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the message said.

  [Text] Today, Yuriy Serhyeyev, head of the [Foreign 
Ministry] Information Directorate, reported at a Defense 
Ministry briefing that the Foreign Affairs Ministry is once 
again asserting that Ukraine does not need the mediation of a 
CIS representative to represent its interests at the United 
Nations. Ukraine's positions, which Volodymyr Handohiy 
[Ukraine's acting permanent representative at the United 
Nations] related at a plenary session of the UN General Assembly 
-- that a CIS representative can only represent the interests of 
those states that have signed the CIS Charter -- remain 
unchanged. As Ukraine has not done this, and also does not 
consider the CIS to be a subject of international law, but only 
a regional organization, Ukrainian diplomacy is in favor of 
direct and not mediated relations with the United Nations.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs </F>
by correspondent Zaiga Grinberga in Riga; for the "Pusdiena" 
program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Grinberga] [passage omitted] I think that, 
nevertheless, today the agreements initialled between Latvia and 
Russia on the withdrawal of the Russian Army must also be 
touched upon because you will examine these agreements at 
today's Cabinet of Ministers meeting. The Cabinet of Ministers 
must then confirm them. 
  I think there still are, however, some ambiguities. Other 
countries--some of them that have even congratulated Latvia on 
such an outcome to the talks and are satisfied--at the same 
time, are they satisfied? [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Birkavs, are these other countries, after all, aware of 
how many troops will remain here and of what this process will 
be like? 
  [Birkavs] Mrs. Grinberga, you immediately grab the bull by 
the horns very strongly. [passage omitted] I would very much 
like everyone to feel secure and stable about the future during 
this heated time. Precisely during the present day, however, 
our state's boat or our state's ship is being rocked quite 
heavily in connection with the agreement between Russia and 
Latvia. Moreover, it is being rocked in such a way that all the 
values that we possess and that we have achieved and for which 
we are striving may collapse. 
  We, of course, are very thoroughly evaluating each sentence 
in the agreement. The agreement is the result of two years of 
difficult talks, in which a compromise in one place gave an 
opportunity to move forward at another place. The heart was 
heavy before signing this agreement, but the agreement is a 
guarantee. It is a guarantee for our future: that the troops 
will definitely leave, that Skrunda will definitely be 
eliminated, and that military pensioners will definitely be 
controlled in our state. This is because one of the component 
parts of the agreement are the lists of pensioners, of the 
militarists; 22,000--that is a big number--but we will know them 
all. At the present moment, we do not even know them all. 
  We will know exactly who those 599 military persons will be 
who are to be located at the Skrunda facility. When we know all 
those persons--in the near future we are forming an immigration 
policy--then we will find much more easily the superfluous ones. 
We will much more easily isolate them and much more easily 
extradite them from the state. Therefore, we must very 
thoroughly weigh in, but the movement toward signing the 
agreement is absolutely necessary. I think that the attitude of 
the world toward signing of the agreement is comparatively 
unequivocal in principle; it is positive, because the world sees 
that we are using a civilized method. [passage omitted] 
  [Grinberga] Is it, after all, really ethical to lay down in 
such detail those social guarantees for the military people who 
will be considered pensioners and will be considered retired. 
These minute concerns that have been laid down in one of the 
agreements, why is it necessary to do so in that much detail, to 
do so very thoroughly? 
  [Birkavs] You see, in one of the agreements all the minute 
concerns have been laid down that are being implemented until 31 
August. After 31 August, both these minute and major concerns 
will end for us because the troops, and their family members, 
and the military persons who retired after this agreement was 
concluded are being guaranteed definite rights until they leave. 
That is those who retired after 28 January 1992; in fact, it is 
from the moment when Yeltsin recognized the former USSR troops 
as their troops. Until that moment that all the complex of 
military persons leaves, they are being guaranteed definite 
rights--comparatively minute, yes, but so it is. This is until 
the agreement's ... [pauses] until the troops leave. 
  Another agreement relates to the stay in Latvia of military 
persons, of retired military persons. Of course, if we would be 
able to get rid of these retired military persons easily without 
an agreement--and they would leave with the troops--this would 
be an ideal version. I would be the most glad of all. This is 
not possible, however; therefore, it is laid down in the 
agreement that they cannot and never will obtain Latvian 
citizenship under any conditions and that they must subjugate 
themselves to the laws of Latvia. 
  They have those minute concerns for themselves, as you said, 
to be allowed medical services, to visit the dentist, on general 
grounds. So that their apartments will be warm--although the 
apartments of Latvians, as they usually are, are cold--this has 
been laid down in the agreement. So, neither more nor less is 
given to them than to others, but these were the demands by the 
Russian side. This is what they insisted on, as a result of 
which we have arrived at the agreement that will rid us of them 
after all. 
  [Grinberga] So, would you also please tell us with what 
means 
will the Skrunda radar station be dismantled--those 
buildings--with what money? 
  [Birkavs] I think that--although hatred and anger against 
Skrunda is so great that the radar station might collapse by 
that alone--nevertheless, the U.S. Senate will decide on 15 
April on allocating 10 million dollars in order to make use of 
technical means for dismantling the Skrunda radar station. 
Dismantling can begin, dismantling of the new radar station can 
begin at the moment the agreement is signed. I have already 
spoken with people about whether they would be ready to drive 
there with tractors, although a tractor will not suffice. 
Actually, the Skrunda radar station, the new one, must be 
levelled to the ground. Also, the foundations must be blown up. 
No kind of a temptation must remain there for Russia. If 
foundations were to remain, then building the top--that big 
one--could be done very quickly. Therefore, at that moment 
when there will be nothing--neither the foundations nor the 
top--we will be fully convinced that Russia will not make any 
kind of investments for building a new radar station. They 
will, evidently, invest that in Belarus, at Baranovichi.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 29, BNS -- Latvia is sending Russia a 
note of protest in view of a recent incident between Russian 
military persons and Latvian Homeguards, during which a series 
of illegalities were detected in the conduct of Russian 
servicemen. 
  The incident occured March 16 in the Riga district Stopini 
firing ground situated outside the territory of a nearby 
Russian military base. 
  The Russian servicemen had staged field excercise on the 
firing ground without a permit from the local authority, neither 
had they movement permits from the bureau monitoring the troop 
withdrawal. The incident was settled peacefully and the detained 
servicemen returned to their unit. 
  According to the note, Latvia hopes that similar incidents, 
which may have serious consequences, will be averted in the 
future. 
  Latvian Foreign Ministry's Aivars Vovers invited Russian 
diplomat Valeri Nesterushkin Tuesday [29 March] to receive the 
note.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 29, BNS -- A crowd of 200 gathered in 
front of the Cabinet building in Riga Tuesday [29 March] to 
protest the Latvian-Russian tentative agreement on troop 
withdrawal. 
  The meeting was organized by the Tevzeme (Fatherland) 
national association which dislikes the initialed agreement 
because it stipulates temporary functioning of a 
Russian-operated radar facility and guarantees rights of Russian 
war pensioners in the Baltic country. 
  The picket held slogans "The Oppressors Should Not Stay on 
the Land of the Oppressed," "Latvia No Resort for Russian 
Officers," chanting "Down with Government that Sells the Latvian 
Nation" and "Occupants -- Get Out." 
  The demonstrators demanded Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs or 
Special Tasks Minister Edvins Inkens to come out and speak on 
their record in front of the rally. But the officials did not 
appear. 
  Latvian National Independence Movement leader Aristids 
Lembergs was present in the meeting. Lembergs said that the 
agreements have not been ratified in the Saeima (parliament) yet 
and they bear no signature of the Latvian president. 
Consequently, the picket may help to form the opinion of 
deputies, he added. 
  The Cabinet is discussing the withdrawal agreement today.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 29, BNS -- Practically all offensive 
weapons have been removed from the Tallinn-based Russian 144th 
motorized rifle division, a high-ranking official from the 
Estonian Defense Ministry told BNS on condition of anonymity. 
  The Defense Ministry has information that a troop train with 
the last remaining armored equipment of the 144th division 
leaves Estonia at the beginning of April. The number of means 
of transport and men in the division is not known. 
  The Russian division has to date turned over to Estonia the

  [Excerpt] Juri Tikk, the government's special 
representative in Paldiski, said today that the dismantling of 
the nuclear reactors at Paldiski and the accompanying 
introduction of a special regime is due to begin in the second 
half of April. He added that the special regime will be 
introduced for the whole of Pakri Peninsula. First there will 
be the familiar system of permits, but when the reactor's lid is 
lifted, so to speak, the peninsula will be closed completely. 
The special regime will be abolished after the nuclear fuel has 
been removed -- by the end of June or beginning of July. 
  The Russian side will not allow anyone close [words 
indistinct] because several devices on site are alleged to be 
secret, and thus will be assuming total responsibility. Later, 
during the second stage of the removal process, the Russian 
military are willing to allow both Estonian and international 
observers to witness the dismantling process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] As in the northwestern town of Paldiski, a former 
location of a Russian nuclear submarine training base, where the 
registration of inhabitants was carried out last week, 
registration of population should be carried out in all spots 
where Russian military are or were located, Estonian Minister of 
Population Peeter Olesk told a press conference on Tuesday [29 
March]. 
  He named such former Russian military bases as Loksa, 
Keila-Joa, Klooga and Tapa as being the first where similar 
activities should be conducted. 
  Olesk said that besides the need to guarantee security and 
order in Paldiski during the dismantling work of the nuclear 
reactors of the training base, the registry was a good 
experience for the authorities to test the new methods of 
registering. Olesk added that after the census of 1989 the 
number and structure of population in Estonia has changed 
greatly, with no new census being in view before 2000. 
  According to the preliminary results of registering of 
inhabitants in Paldiski, over six thousand people live there, 
Olesk told ETA on Monday. In the course of registration that 
lasted from March 22 to 25, 3,684 registration questionnaires 
were fulfilled. In addition, a list of 892 Russian military and 
their families from the submarine training centre and 69 
military from Tallinn fleet headquarters is in the possession of 
Estonian Government. Children up to 16 years were inscribed in 
the questionnaires of their parents and their exact amount, 
estimated at about one thousand, will be clear next week. 
Another thousand people did not appear at the registration 
mainly for being on a business trip. 
  Olesk added that people that did not register themselves 
will 
have difficulties in moving in the town when the dismantling 
work of the nuclear reactor at the former military base will 
start and people that do not have a registering inscription in 
their documents or do not possess a special permission to be in 
the town, will be detained until their identification is 
determined. 
  Up to now the exact number and composition of population in 
Paldiski, largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and 
Russian military, was not known, for the former town 
authorities, subject to Russian military authorities and 
dissolved by a law adopted by Estonian Riigikogu [parliament] on 
March 9, refused to hand over data on the subject. 
  Government's special representative in Paldiski Juri Tikk 
told a press conference, on Tuesday, that the dismantling work 
of the nuclear reactor, which will bring about a special order 
to be enforced in the town, will start in the second decade of 
April and last till the nuclear fuel is deported from Estonia at 
the end of June or beginning of July. 
  Tikk said that at the first stage of dismantling, the 
Russian 
side will not allow anybody but "his own men" to observe the 
process, for several allegedly secret mechanisms are situated at 
the object. Later Estonian and international observers are 
allowed to observe the liquidation process. 
  Tikk added that the possibility of a "black scenario", which 
would mean a radioactive contamination of the environment, is 
about zero but should not be excluded. In an emergency 
situation Russian side intends to bring 200 chemical specialists 
from Kaliningrad in an hour. In case there is a need to 
evacuate local population, the Estonian side will pay the costs, 
he added.

<F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 61/94] </F>
  [Text] The Russian Committee of Customs has introduced new 
higher customs tariffs on trade with the Baltic states. The new 
tariffs are twice as high as those on other states and are 
likely to result in a sharp decrease of the eastern trade of the 
Baltic states. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar was of the opinion that Russia 
attempted to exert pressure on the Baltic states, but harmed 
itself to an equal degree. This decision proves the correctness 
of the decision of the Estonian Government to reorient its 
economy towards the West. "Estonia is not dependent on Russia 
and we have nothing to fear," he said. 
  Chairman of the Riigikogu [parliament] economic commission 
Ivar Raig described the move as a discrimination against the 
Baltic states. It may result in a growing pressure on the 
kroon, an increased inflation and unemployment, he warned, 
recommending to appeal to the Western powers to link the most 
favoured status in trade with the abolition of discriminatory 
customs tariffs towards the Baltic states. 
  Academician Endel Lippmaa was also convinced that "it is a 
clearly repressive measure which also violates the 
Estonian-Russian agreement." Lippmaa was concerned with the 
influence on Latvia and Lithuania and recommended to impose 
similar high tariffs on the Russian transit trade in order to 
have something to bargain with later. 
  Foreign Ministry advisor Urve Ndu commented the Russian move 
as a violation of the European trading traditions, adding that 
restrictions may be introduced only because of threat to public 
health or environment, according to the GATT requirements. 
  Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar was the most 
pessimistic. The introduction of the new tariffs may have the 
same effect on the export of agricultural products as the 
monetary reform of 1992 -- impossibility of export resulting in 
a stockpiling of products. This further caused a chain of 
indebtedness between the producers and food processing firms. 
The customs tariffs on potatoes reach 50 percent, on meat, milk 
and butter to 30 percent, which make export to Russia 
impossible. There are two alternatives -- to find a new market 
or to further reduce the livestock, Leetsar said. But he added 
that the ministry had foreseen the Russian move and had also 
prepared corresponding recommendations for the protection of the 
Estonian market. 
  Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn pointed out that the 
move may have been caused by Russia's domestic factors. "The 
shops are filled with goods but only 5-15 percent of the 
population can afford them, since the prices are twice as high 
as in Finland," the Ambassador said. He also linked the move 
with the success of the agrarian party at the recent elections.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 29 -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Republic of Estonia informed ETA, on Tuesday [29 
March], of its position regarding the continuing refusal of 
North Korea to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
experts adequately to inspect its nuclear sites. 
  The Ministry, in its statement, supports all peaceful 
initiatives to solve the problems on the Korean peninsula and 
considers the solution of the North Korean nuclear inspection 
question to be an important step toward the unification of the 
Korean people. 
  The Ministry supports the international demand as stated in 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 825 (1993) according 
to which North Korea must allow international experts access to 
all its nuclear sites. 
  The Ministry shares the concerns expressed in the IAEA 
resolution of March 21, 1994 about North Korean violations on 
March 13 and 14 of the agreement which had been reached on 
February 15, 1994. 
  The Ministry finds North Korea's behavior in connection with 
the inspection of its nuclear sites to be non-constructive and 
serving to escalate tensions. 
  The Ministry supports the resolution of the resulting crisis 
via negotiations, including if necessary other nations in that 
region into this process.

  [Excerpt] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup is 
currently on a two-day visit to Estonia. Priit Ennet attended a 
news conference he gave at the airport. 
  [Ennet] Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup intends to 
sign an Estonian-Danish defense cooperation agreement tomorrow. 
Denmark has already concluded similar agreements with Latvia 
and Lithuania. They envisage the holding of consultations in 
order to resolve defense and security issues and dialogue on 
strategic planning. Hans Haekkerup said on arrival at Tallinn 
airport that state defense greements with all Baltic states on 
state defense cooperation are basically very similar. 
  [Begin Haekkerup recording, in English fading to Estonian 
translation] It is important to us that the Baltic states should 
not be set to trail behind other central and eastern European 
countries. We wish to ensure that the Baltic states are part of 
Europe and have access to our security structures, with the help 
of bilateral and multipartite cooperation. We are much 
interested in cooperation with the Baltic peacekeeping 
battalion. The Nordic countries, in conjunction with other 
countries, have been aiming to draft a program of assistance to 
the Baltic battalion. We aim to help to design the battalion's 
structure and cooperate in training. I hope we will be able to 
supply some of the equipment. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 28, BNS -- Estonia is making 
preparations to start the production of hand grenades, Defense 
Ministry Deputy Chancellor Tarmo Molder told BNS. 
  Molder said a state-owned enterprise, a company with state 
participation and a private firm are involved in the project. 
  As next step, Estonia hopes to launch production of shells. 
  Manufacture of domestic cartridges was put off because of 
the 
high cost price. 
  Lithuania is at present the only Baltic nation to produce 
its 
own ammunition -- cartridges and hand grenades. The country 
plans soon to begin making 60 mm and 80 mm cannon and shells for 
them. The Latvian Defense Ministry has invited tenders for the 
manufacture of cartridges.

  [Text] Tallinn, March 28 -- Board of RAS Rahva Haal that 
publishes the second-biggest Estonian daily RAHVA HAAL decided, 
on Monday [28 March], to end the labour contract with the 
editor-in-chief of the daily TOOMAS LEITO and stop publishing 
the daily starting Tuesday. 
  Managing editor of the paper Tiit Lehiste told ETA that as 
soon as publishing the daily will be stopped, AS RH, a 
joint-stock company, founded by the staff of the paper last year 
to participate at the privatization of the paper, was ready to 
start issuing a new Estonian daily with the same contents. 
  Turmoil over the daily started already in May last year when 
Estonian Privatization Agency decided to privatize the 
state-owned newspaper. Head of the Privatization Agency Liia 
Hanni has admitted later that in the course of the 
privatization, the result of which is that two applicants to the 
daily gave the matter to the court, the Agency acted in 
disagreement with existing laws. At present the matter has 
reached the Supreme Court and the privatization of the daily has 
been stopped. 
  In October last year the board of the daily was changed with 
majority given to representatives of the government coalition. 
On March 18 the board adopted a decision to change the statutes 
of the company, abolishing the institution of editor-in-chief 
and create a new institution of publisher-in-chief. On Monday 
majority of the staff of the paper, in protest to the decision, 
resigned and decided to join RH. On Tuesday, the 
editor-in-chief was sacked, a decision which was later, in the 
course of week-long talks between the board of RAS Rahva Haal, 
AS RH and Ministry of Culture and Education, abolished. 
Editor-in-chief of Rahva Haal Toomas Leito told ETA that the 
decisions of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been of "purely 
political" nature. 
  The decisions of the board were followed by a series of 
statements by Journalists and Newspapers Unions and well-known 
public figures, denouncing the decisions of the board, saying 
they aimed at creating censorship in Estonia. 
  RAHVA HAAL is the biggest daily distributed all over Estonia 
that belongs to the state. Its circulation is 47.6 thousand at 
week-days and 50 thousand at Saturdays. 
  On Monday, East and Central-European Newspaper Publishers 
Forum protested against the Estonian government's "attempts to 
put ideological pressure on the newspaper". In its letter to 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar the Forum demands quickening 
of privatization of newspapers in Estonia in the way the 
government has promised to do it. "During privatization debates 
there should be no ideological control over RAHVA HAAL or any 
other newspaper", the participants of the Forum Bucharest 
meeting stress in their statement. 
  The Forum calls stopping privatization of press in Estonia 
as 
"causing extreme concern", recalling the government's promise to 
privatize also the state news agency ETA and a state radio 
channel, which have also come to a deadlock. "It is already the 
third time during the last half year that international press 
organisations have had to protest against the media policy of 
Estonian government," editor-in-chief of the BALTIC INDEPENDENT 
weekly and deputy chairman of the board of the Estonian 
Newspapers Union Tarmu Tammerk told ETA, recalling government's 
attempts to establish an 18 per cent turnover tax to all press 
publications in Estonia and government's first attempt to 
privatize RAHVA HAAL.

  [Text] Baku (March 29) TURAN -- In the near future Russia 
will present a new plan on settlement of the conflict, said 
special envoy of Russian President, Vladimir Kazimirov. He said 
that the consultations of the experts of warring parties were 
conducted constructively. Kazimirov mentioned that the first 
and the foremost condition is complete cease-fire and then 
liberation of occupied territories. Then Kazimirov said that 
they could not find agreements on several points of the 
agreement since they can be settled by the top echelons of power. 
  Kazimirov said that "the parties can achieve peace using 
only 
stage-by-stage settlement plan". At the same time Kazimirov 
said that "unfortunately, both parties do not refuse to settle 
the matter using military way".

  [Text] Despite enemy's frequent change of positions along 
the entire front in recent days, their firing positions are 
being silenced with effective return fire. 
  Based on the daily reports of the republic's Defense 
Ministry, we can say that the enemy offensives last week ended 
in failure. The tension first arose on our borders with Armenia 
and around Fizuli. But the enemy's hasty offensive did not 
achieve its objective. Fizuli and Alikhanly were the targets of 
this attack. The enemy was forced to retreat with losses. At 
least 20 Armenian soldiers were killed near our positions around 
Ashagi-Seyidakhmedly. The operations around Goradiz were also 
successful. Our artillery destroyed two enemy vehicles full of 
troops. 
  But all these events have not deterred the ferocious enemy 
from pursuing its objective; only the zone of confrontation is 
changing. The enemy is concentrating its real force and military 
equipment on our northwestern borders. The settlements in 
Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy rayons have been coming under intensive 
shelling for the last three days. The occupation army's acts 
were not left unanswered. Despite shifts in the locus of its 
attacks, the enemy is unable to resist our army's 
counterattacks. As a result, Shirvanly and Garagashly in 
Agdamskiy Rayon were liberated. Many other cities are awaiting 
similar liberation and many cities still suffer the enemy's 
occupation. But every inch of these lands is waiting and 
relying on your effort and skill, O Azerbaijani soldier.

  [Text] Baku (March 29) TURAN -- This morning the meeting of 
Milli Majlis [National Assembly] resumed. There is an 
acceptance of the resolution about the events of January 20, 
1990 on the agenda. As it was announced that last week Milli 
Majlis discussed the question for three days, but failed to 
adopt a final decision. 
  During today's discussion the Speaker Rasul Guliyev and his 
deputy Afiaddin Dzhalilov closely support the draft of the 
document, however the oppositional and independent deputies are 
against the document. 
  As it was earlier informed, the aim of the document is to 
accuse the Popular [People's] Front of Azerbaijan [PFA] as well 
as the former leadership of Azerbaijan (Mutalibov and Vezirov) 
in the bloody events of January 1990. However, the number of 
the deputies supporting the former leadership and the Popular 
Front of Azerbaijan in today's meeting is considerable. 
  As TURAN NEWS AGENCY was informed by one of the Milli Majlis 
members "though President Aliyev and his supporters try to make 
decisions in favour of their ideas, they will fail".

  [Text] The parliament of Azerbaijan qualified the 
introduction of Soviet troops in Baku on January 20, 1990 as a 
reprisal and a grave and unprecedentedly cruel crime against the 
Azerbaijani people. 
  The parliament resolution, adopted on March 29, says that 
the 
blame for this crime rests entirely with the Soviet authorities, 
led by Mikhail Gorbachev, and on the Azerbaijani leadership of 
that time, above all Abdurakhman Vizirov and Viktor Polyanichko, 
then first and second secretaries of the Azerbaijani Communist 
Party; Ayaz Mutalibov, the chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers, 
Elmira Gafarova, the chairperson of the parliament's presidium, 
and Vagif Gusseynov, the chairman of Azerbaijan's KGB. Legal 
action has been initiated against these figures and also against 
former head of the Azerbaijani KGB's 4th department Nikolay 
Starchenkov, and Mark Shmotkin, the commander of the Baku Higher 
Military School, who organized an explosion in the Azerbaijani 
TV center. 
  The document also says that legal action against Polyanichko 
and Gafarova were stopped because of the said figures' death. 
  Meanwhile, some of the deputies insisted that the list of 
those guilty of the tragedy shall be supplemented with the names 
of Yevgeny Primakov, Dmitriy Yazov, Nikolay Kryuchkov and Vadim 
Bakatin. 
  Most of the deputies agreed with President Gaydar Aliyev, 
who 
said that the blame for the tragedy rests with the former Soviet 
state. 
  A leader of the parliamentary opposition Etibar Mamedov 
believes that the final assessment of the events in Baku in 
January 1990, may only be given by a new parliament, not the 
current one, elected during the rule of communists.

<F P=106> [Weekly interview with President Eduard Shevardnadze by </F>
correspondent Nato Oniani--recorded] 
  [Text] [Nato Oniani] Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, last week 
the situation grew tense again in Abkhazia. Villages in 
Abkhazian Svaneti [northeastern Abkhazia] were attacked, and 
villages in Zugdidi Rayon were shelled. People have been 
wounded and killed. How would you assess the aggravation of the 
situation in the wake of ideas expressed in the UN secretary 
general's report? Do you think it is an attempt by Abkhaz 
leaders to make a permanent border along the Enguri River? What 
will Russia's position be if the situation is aggravated? Will 
that big treaty with Russia be useful for us as a defense 
mechanism, considering that one of the paragraphs of the treaty 
prohibits training and sending combat units from the territory 
of one undersigned country to the other? 
  [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The aggravation of 
the situation in Abkhazia: We have to take any possible 
measures, and certain measures have already been taken, to 
protect the villages. Definite stabilization of the situation 
was observed yesterday. Some civilians, including the wounded, 
were led out. In connection with the aggravation of the 
situation, I appealed to the Russian president, as you know. 
This was followed by the Russian Government's statement. I am 
not able say what influence this statement has had or will have 
on Abkhazs or what practical action the Russian Government will 
take, but we can infer that the Abkhazian side has planned a 
fairly large-scale operation. The very near future will show 
whether this can be stopped and a state of stability can be 
restored. At least, the Russian Government's statement says 
that the sides should immediately stop any activities leading to 
further aggravation and new confrontation in Abkhazia. 
  Now, what is my assessment of these events? We are facing an 
event that cannot be defined in words other than the following: 
Gudauta leaders are openly and publicly slighting both the 
United Nations and Russia because the appeal by Russia--the 
Russian Government's appeal--is not the first. If these appeals 
are sincere and if their mediation also has sincere aims, I mean 
aims for peace, this action carried out by those in Gudauta can 
be regarded as nothing but a slighting of both the United 
Nations and Russia. I believe this should considered at the UN 
Security Council and in Russia. 
  In this connection, I must say that I do not understand what 
mission the UN observers are carrying out in Abkhazia. Back in 
Sukhumi [just before the city fell to Abkhaz forces in autumn 
1993], I was also puzzled. I still do not understand the aim of 
their stay here. Expenses are rather high. Indeed, we favored 
the idea of their intervening from the very beginning. But as a 
new stage of the confrontation is beginning, and we are already 
facing this, and the observers do not utter a word or even make 
a statement, this should make us feel concerned. The United 
Nations and its leadership should think about it. Let them at 
least blame us. Most of all I cannot understand their silence 
when preliminary agreements to cease fire and not to aggravate 
the situation are openly violated. I am still convinced that 
the dialogue should be renewed, because the failure of a peace 
mission meets the interest of neither the United Nations nor 
Russia. We have been positive about the necessity of the 
peaceful settlement since the very beginning of the Abkhazian 
conflict. We still confirm our readiness for the renewal of 
negotiations. However, as I have already said, we also have to 
be ready for different measures. 
  [Shevardnadze continues] Joint actions by the United 
Nations, Russia, and countries friendly to Georgia can grow into 
an extremely interesting precedent that can be used as a model 
or as an interesting example of the settlement of conflicts 
after the Soviet Union has disintegrated. This is a really 
unprecedented case when an international organization--the UN 
Security Council; one of its members--Russia; and four other 
countries, including members of the Security Council, are 
cooperating with the aim of settling a conflict. It is 
significant that this concerns one of the republics, one of the 
countries of the former Soviet Union. When all of this ends, it 
will be of the utmost significance for the future because the 
occurrence of similar conflicts cannot be ruled out in other 
countries. 
  As for the significance of the treaty with Russia, I have 
talked about it repeatedly. I would like to reconfirm that we 
will not be able to reach any sort of peace in Abkhazia unless 
we have Russia's backing in our striving to establish peace. 
  A few words about the commitments of the two sides. We, 
Georgia, are already implementing our commitments stipulated by 
the treaty and abide by every paragraph, every statement, every 
word. It is of great importance that we have signed an 
agreement on protecting state borders jointly. I believe that 
the Russian leadership aspires to the same thing, or something 
similar, in order to implement the whole package of agreements 
Mr. Yeltsin and I signed in Tbilisi and to implement it the way 
our peoples expect. 
  You have mentioned a renewed conflict, the aggravation of 
the 
situation in the Zugdidi area. My representatives are there, 
and as far as I know they have gotten in touch with Gudauta. 
There is an impression that the incidents that occurred there 
and which had serious effects have been provoked by the lack of 
control. I have been told that by their observations the 
incidents were initiated by the militants deployed in the area. 
This can be regarded as proof that the Gudauta leadership 
cannot control the situation in all regions. This is my answer. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. Last week, Georgia joined NATO's 
Partnership for Peace program, and a NATO delegation arrived in 
Tbilisi. You appealed to them for active support and the 
strengthening of peace. Do you think that NATO can be more 
active-- I mean active involvement--as of a political 
organization, in order to prevent current events from becoming a 
source of new confrontation and new turmoil in Turkey, as a NATO 
country, or in Russia, which will apparently join the NATO 
initiative. These are the countries you have mentioned, as well 
as Iran. 
  [Shevardnadze] The principal subject I discussed with the 
NATO delegation pertained to principles of cooperation between 
NATO and CIS, and NATO and Russia. You might ask me why the 
cooperation between NATO and Georgia did not attract principal 
attention. It did indeed attract attention, but I want to 
reiterate that NATO is not able to go far in its cooperation 
with us. A confrontation between NATO and Russia would lead the 
world to a situation in which relatively small countries would 
be harmed--and Georgia would be harmed first. Cooperation with 
NATO is undoubtedly promising in the long run. It seems very 
interesting. I, as well as the leaders of Russia and other 
countries, have given a positive assessment of the Partnership 
for Peace initiative, and it will be efficient if we are not led 
into a new wave of confrontation. I am still referring to 
relations between CIS and NATO and Russia and NATO. I believe 
that this very issue is central today. If these relations are 
normal, Georgia will gain a lot from this: As I once said, a 
commonwealth of commonwealths. 
  [Oniani] One of the most important events of the past week 
was the parliament's endorsement of the Cabinet of Ministers. So 
far, one candidate for vice premier has been approved and 
another has not been approved. Do you believe that the Cabinet 
you have presented will receive support? 
  [Shevardnadze] I will tell you the state of affairs. The 
Cabinet is working because the prime minister and one vice 
premier have been approved, although all this has taken a lot of 
time. I am going to meet the parliamentary majority today for 
additional consultations. I have had a contact, a dialogue, 
with the minority, and I would like to say that the dialogue was 
constructive. We must come to an agreement in the parliament as 
well as in the whole community that a policy of defiance will do 
no one good today. If the endorsement of the Cabinet drags out 
and grows complicated, the crisis will be aggravated because the 
country will be even more unmanageable. That is why I believe 
the endorsement of the Cabinet should be done quickly. This is 
in our common interests. 
  Quite a few issues about the ways to conduct our work are to 
be considered during the meetings with both the majority and the 
minority. I would like to appeal to the parliament to work more 
intensely--on Tuesday and probably on Wednesday and 
Thursday--and we would be able to finish this task in three or 
four days. We should approve those whom we consider necessary. 
The ministers should be sure that their mission continues. If 
someone is not trusted, this is an issue that should be handled 
promptly. I cannot rule out that I will use my right to 
repeatedly present a candidate that the parliament has not 
approved. 
  [Oniani] Here is the final question. Your visit to the 
United States, as well as the Ukrainian and Kazakh leaders' 
visits, has caused a complex reaction in certain circles in 
Russia. I would say it caused a remarkable irritation. I would 
not say that our opposition has reacted to this positively 
either. There emerged an idea that this visit was premature and 
could have affected certain processes negatively. 
  [Shevardnadze] No, it was by no means premature. It was a 
little overdue for various reasons. 
  Now, about our tasks in connection with this visit. I made 
explicit statements about it during my TV interview and 
addresses on the radio. The task of primary importance was to 
convey a message of the truth from a height like the Security 
Council, and I was able to stand on a high rostrum many times 
during the visit. I am referring to conversations with 
President Clinton and his associates, conversations in the 
Congress, and so on. I believe that a very useful and necessary 
job has been done. 
  The second task was to secure the continuation of Georgia's 
relations with the West by making it more concrete and 
permanent. I regard this as a concern for Georgia's future, and 
my visit served to reinforce the basis of the relations. 
  Apart from all of this, I had to go to the United States of 
America just to express gratitude for the assistance they 
rendered along with other Western countries. If we are still 
alive, we are alive because of assistance from the European 
Union. And you know the contribution France, England, and 
other countries render through the European Union. We have been 
getting constant assistance from the United States. This had to 
be said, and the gratitude of the Georgian people had to be 
expressed. 
  I have announced that President Clinton promised aid of up 
to 
$70 million. Amplification is being done now, new programs are 
being added and I was informed the day before yesterday that the 
sum had increased to $80-85 million. 
  [Shevardnadze] This will increase if we meet our 
commitments on securing stability in the country. Above all, 
these commitments are in our interests. 
  I saw immense prospects for American business, and foreign 
businesses including Russia and other countries in general, to 
flow into Georgia. Georgia will only gain from this. 
  Now a few words about that irritation you have mentioned. 
This visit was extremely interesting and useful in the context 
of relations between Russia and the United States and East-West 
relations in general. I do not think that Georgia and its 
leader are entitled to a distinguished mission as regards 
East-West relations, but every country including Georgia is 
capable of contributing to this. 
  I believe that preventing a new wave of confrontation 
between 
East and West, between Russia and the United States, should be 
the main concern of all countries, big as well as small. I 
believe that normal relations between these two countries are of 
special interest for small countries, including Georgia. Any 
kind of confrontation would harm our national interests. 
  Another thing: An independent state should not be worried if 
it acts in the interest of universal peace. Any kind of 
negative reaction to actions not contradicting the interest of 
universal peace can be considered as survival of imperialist 
thinking. Everyone has to get used to the idea that yesterday is 
over, and we have to deal with new countries, independent 
countries, who plan visits themselves. Incidentally, I would 
like to tell you that when the date of President Yeltsin's visit 
coincided with my visit to France... [Oniani interrupts] 
  [Oniani] He postponed his visit... 
  [Shevardnadze] This has proved again that the president is 
well aware that old times and the old system have passed, and he 
has postponed his visit for 10 days so that our planned visit to 
Paris, France, will not fail. So nothing terrible is happening. 
There will be negative opinions, too, but in general the visit 
has played its role and accomplished its positive mission for 
Georgia and not only for Georgia. 
  [Oniani] Thank you. You have been listening to Mr. Eduard 
Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian parliament and head of 
state.

  [Text] The latest session of the Georgian parliament was 
held today, 29 March, and was addressed by the head of state, 
Eduard Shevardnadze. In his address, he commented on the 
Security Council's last resolution on the situation in Abkhazia, 
in which, the head of state stressed, "the stance of the 
Republic of Georgia" is confirmed. The head of state said that 
the resolution of the Security Council was a balanced document 
in which the legal status of Abkhazia was defined clearly within 
the framework of single, indivisible Georgia. It allows the 
hope that the question will be resolved by exclusively political 
means. 
  The head of the Georgian state especially singled out the 
formulation of the Security Council's resolution concerning the 
refugees who, according to Paragraph 3 of the resolution, must, 
without any limits, return to their homes in all rayons of 
Abkhazia. 
  Shevardnadze once again confirmed the readiness of the 
Georgian side to negotiate with the representatives of Abkhazia, 
despite the resumption of war by the separatists in the Kodori 
gorge. 
  The chairman of the republic's parliament announced with 
responsibility, before parliament and the state, that Georgia 
had not initiated the current escalation of tension in the 
Abkhazian Svaneti and the rayons adjacent to the Inguri River 
and that Georgia would not betray its course of "peaceful and 
political settlement of the conflict, about which the United 
Nations, the Security Council, and Russia must be informed".

<F P=106> [Interview with Zurab Gagnidze, leader of the National </F>
Ideology Party, by Nana Pitskhelauri; place and date not given: 
"I Have Been Called the Georgian Zhirinovskiy...." -- all 
questions published in boldface] 
  [Excerpts] Zurab Gagnidze is the leader of the National 
Ideology Party [NIP] and a philosopher and political scientist. 
He was born and brought up in Tbilisi. He graduated from the 
philosophy faculty of Tbilisi State University. He continued 
his studies as a postgraduate. He is a candidate of 
philosophical sciences. He has worked as a teacher in higher 
educational establishments in Tbilisi. At the request of our 
readers, as we promised, we propose to you an interview with 
this person. We leave you to supply any commentary. 
  [Pitskhelauri]Your, as they say, alliance with 
Zhirinovskiy [leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia 
(LDPR]) has alarmed the Georgian public. What we mean are the 
letters you sent to him. 
  [Gagnidze] I did indeed send these letters to Zhirinovskiy. 
We stated that our party is the true opposition in Georgia today 
(as opposed to those "pseudo-oppositionists" who are motivated 
by personal interests and ambitions) and I addressed the LDPR 
leader as one opposition [leader] to another. Moreover, the 
welfare of Georgia and Russia forms the basis for all this. 
  [Pitskhelauri]Until now, you have been known by a large 
part of society as an active comrade-in-arms of Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia.... 
  [Gagnidze] I got involved in the national movement in 
1989-90. I became an ally of Zviad Gamsakhurdia. At that time, 
I was getting my own articles published. Zviad told me in 
public: "You know how to write and you should use this to serve 
the national movement." The first articles that I had published 
were on political science; they concerned national will and 
national freedom. 
  Later on, there was disagreement between myself and the 
president about cadres selection. The National Ideology 
Association was formed on 12 September 1991 and was transformed 
into a party exactly one year later. 
  We are struggling for the restoration of national ideology. 
Our variant of state organization is national 
self-administration. This is quite separate from a presidential 
or parliamentary form of government and constitutional monarchy. 
National ideology is the only path toward the salvation of 
Georgia, and not only Georgia. After all, the idea of humanity 
forms the basis of our ideology. 
  Following the overthrow of Zviad's government, national 
ideas 
were being cursed along with the president, which was a moral 
blow for us. I said then, and repeat now, that the government 
should have been replaced without recourse to bloodshed and 
barbaric methods. 
  Second, we are, philosophically speaking, idealists. We have 
also developed the question of a national religion. Religion 
should express the natural qualities and potentialities of each 
nation and its soul. It will get rid of confrontation and unite 
all Georgians. 
  [Pitskhelauri]If it is not a secret, what were your 
letters to Zhirinovskiy about? 
  [Gagnidze] The first one expressed our attitude to the 
elections. We believe that Zhirinovskiy expressed the will of 
the Russian people and hence was victorious. Therefore, we 
decided to welcome this fact. I sent the first letter to Volf 
dze [son of Volf -- Zhirinovskiy] on 12 December. It turned out 
that, after the Russian elections, opposition parties in Georgia 
condemned the results. Some were forgetting that Zhirinovskiy 
had been elected by his own people and that we have no right to 
interfere in their choice. 
  This led to my sending a personal letter of congratulations. 
The reason for the second letter concerned Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
Our party believed that the ex-president could, under no 
circumstances, be buried in Groznyy. We decided to appeal to 
Zhirinovskiy, Butrus-Ghali, and Ilia II [Georgian patriarch], to 
intervene in some way, in accordance with the principles 
underlying the protection of human rights, so that the president 
could be buried in Mtatsminda [burial place in Tbilisi for 
eminent Georgians] or in the courtyard of the Kolkhuri tower. 
  The next letter concerned the treaty signed between Georgia 
and Russia. The Russian Duma refused to ratify it. We appealed 
to Russia's national forces not to oppose the signing of this 
treaty. 
  I don't know who should take the credit for this but this 
process was stopped. 
  Another point of contact with Zhirinovskiy was the political 
amnesty. We welcomed the fact that the political prisoners 
Khasbulatov and Rutskoy had been released from Lefortovo prison. 
  That was all. So, there is nothing to fear and condemn 
regarding what we did. [passage omitted] 
  [Pitskhelauri]Zbigniew Brzezhinski also pointed out 
that chauvinism could grow into fascism and this was easier to 
envisage following Zhirinovskiy's appearance on the political 
arena. 
  [Gagnidze] I believe that it is only Zhirinovskiy who 
expresses the will of the Russian nation today. He is a fairly 
complex phenomenon. It has become a common event to curse and 
hurl all kinds of slander at a new leader as soon as he appears 
on the political scene. We also have experienced such facts. 
  Zhirinovskiy stated in his first speech during the election 
campaign that, if he alone was criticizing the current 
authorities, it was because they were interfering in the 
administration of other republics, specifically Georgia. 
  Well, isn't Yeltsin aiming to create a powerful state? Like 
Volf dze and unlike Yeltsin, we also support democracy that is 
not limited, but on a large scale and believe that Yeltsin's 
heyday is over and Zhirinovskiy's is imminent. 
  I forgot to mention that we stated in the concluding part of 
the letter to Zhirinovskiy: "Your victory in the elections will 
have a beneficial influence on strengthening Georgia's national 
independence and protecting its territorial integrity." 
  We should make use of this person. 
  [Pitskhelauri] You were recently christened on television 
as the Georgian Zhirinovskiy. 
  [Gagnidze] That's right. If I'm not mistaken, it was on 
"Ibervizia" that I was called the Georgian Zhirinovskiy. They 
probably saw that the similarity between us lay in what he wants 
for Russia and what I want for Georgia, that is to say, 
territorial integrity. 
  The difference between us lies in the fact that Zhirinovskiy 
is a Jew by nationality whereas "there is not a drop of my blood 
that is not Georgian." 
  I would also like to point out that we Georgians have the 
habit of comparing anyone dynamic who appears on the scene with 
foreigners. It would be my wish not to be known as the Georgian 
Zhirinovskiy, but for Zhirinovskiy to be called the Georgian [as 
published] Gagnidze. [passage omitted] 
  [Pitskhelauri] In conclusion, let us turn to the current 
problems facing Georgia. How do you assess parliament's 
ratification of the document on Georgia joining the CIS? 
  [Gagnidze] Frankly speaking, I have a strong antipathy 
toward the Georgian parliament. There is no doubt that it has 
to be dissolved. During one year, this parliament has not been 
able to issue a single law. To put it crudely, it reminds me of 
a cow that is well looked after, but cannot produce any milk. 
It is no better than the former parliament; if anything, it is 
worse. 
  I agree with Batoni [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi 
Shevardnadze when he said that there should first be order not 
among the people but in parliament. As regards the CIS, this is 
an ephemeral association that contains aspects of security. I 
believe that the association should be based on free will. The 
question of ratification should be put to a referendum and the 
Georgian people should decide whether Georgia joins the CIS or 
not; it should not be decided by parliament, which does not have 
the moral right or the power to decide the country's fate. 
  The question of dissolving parliament and holding new 
elections in which we would like to take part should be put on 
the agenda in the near future. 
  [Pitskhelauri]What would be the most desirable outcome 
of the elections for you? 
  [Gagnidze] I have already told you -- national 
self-administration.

  [Text] Preliminary reports show that 702000060100f members of the 
new parliament were elected in the Saturday elections in South 
Ossetia, the self-proclaimed republic within Georgia. This was 
reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the South Ossetian leader 
Ludvig Chibirov who pointed to the high turnout. A total of 80 
of registered voters cast their ballots. 
  The second round of voting is scheduled for April 10. 
Chibirov will also run the second time because there are five 
more candidates in his electoral district. 
  Meanwhile, an aide of the leader of Georgia, that does not 
recognize the republic, has described the elections as illegal. 
In an interview Vazha Khachapuridze said they were aimed at the 
separation of South Ossetia from Georgia. He said the step 
contradicts the trilateral Dagomys agreements and could 
aggravate the situation. "International experts will pass their 
verdict on the lawfulness of the elections", the aide said.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Pavshentsev report: "Everything Changes. Even a </F>
Name"] 
  [Text] Tbilisi -- The Transcaucasus Border District has 
changed its name. It is now called the Caucasus Special Border 
District. The change of name reflects the need to pursue a 
unified border policy in the Caucasus as a whole. The 
district's troop directorate has been relocated from Tbilisi to 
Stavropol. 
  "The directorate of the `Gruziya' troop group of Russian 
border troops will function in Tbilisi," Colonel V. Chistousov, 
chief of the troop group, said. "None of the units has left the 
territory of Georgia, and each of them is continuing to guard 
the border in the same structure. I hope that attacks on border 
subunits, the taking of motor vehicles, and hostage taking are a 
thing of the past and that the attitude toward those who defend 
Georgia's interests on the border will change." 
  During last year alone approximately 100 intruders were 
detained by Russian border guards on the Georgian-Turkish 
border. But there are no grounds for complacency. Georgian 
Security Minister I. Georgadze declared in an interview with the 
newspaper SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA that all the preconditions exist 
for the republic to be able to become a major transshipment 
point for the transit of drugs to Europe and America from Asian 
countries. 
  Tasks of guarding the border are resolved jointly with the 
Georgian Border Troops Department. An agreement has been signed 
on the procedure for manning the Russian Federation border 
troops and for the performance of military service on a 
voluntary basis by citizens of Georgia on the republic's 
territory. It is planned to draft up to 600 people in the fall. 
  In the opinion of the chief of the "Gruziya" troop group, 
the 
agreement will create a favorable basis for forming Georgia's 
own border troops.

  [Text] The Seimas ratified an agreement today between the 
Republic of Lithuania and the European Economic Community on the 
development of fishing. 
  This agreement was signed in Brussels on 17 December 1993. 
The sides agreed to cooperate closer in the preservation and 
rational use of the stock of fish in the areas under the 
jurisdiction of both sides and the neighboring areas. The EEC 
promises to contribute to the improvement of the knowledge of 
the Lithuanian fishing industry workers and allocate financial 
assistance for their training. The agreement envisages that the 
sides will encourage the establishment of joint fishing industry 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yuriy Stroganov: "What Kind of </F>
City Karaljaucius Is; How Lithuania Understands Kaliningrad 
Oblast's Status"] 
  [Text] Vilnius -- A statement by the philosopher Romualdas 
Ozolas, the influential Lithuanian politician and Sejm member, 
about Kaliningrad forces us to return to the subject of 
Lithuania's mutual relations with that region. R. Ozolas' 
diplomatic and legal discovery is that the agreement on the 
status of Kaliningrad Oblast was reached immediately after the 
war by the participants in the Potsdam conference, one of which 
has "died." The philosopher has in mind the USSR. Thus, he 
concludes, the CSCE still has to decide whether to allow the 
USSR's heir, Russia, to continue to control this oblast. 
  This politician's statement could be dismissed and ignored: 
What does it matter what someone says in the heat of polemics. 
But two considerations prevent this. First, it would be 
interesting to know how the independent states which have 
appeared on the map of the former USSR would react if Russia 
were to allow itself to address to them a small proportion of 
such statements connected with the disputed nature of particular 
territories. I do not mention the fact that Russia's immediate 
neighbors often choose brief segments of history which suit them 
and lustfully state their right to a particular region, playing 
conjuring tricks with all kinds of international documents. 
  Second, Lithuania's official figures in contrast to R. 
Ozolas 
(actually, let us not forget he is a member of parliament) do 
not allow themselves such speeches and nonetheless the subject 
of Kaliningrad Oblast is increasingly present in their 
statements "against" Russia. Before, Foreign Minister Povilas 
Gylys said that the numerical strength of the servicemen in the 
oblast is far smaller than some mass media claim. But in his 
January letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher he 
was already voicing great concern at the Russian Army 
concentration in Kaliningrad Oblast and drew attention to the 
need to demilitarize the region. 
  It is not hard to notice that the change in his position is 
in the mainstream of the opinions of opposition forces and 
right-wing movements. Back when he was chairman of the 
Lithuanian Supreme Soviet, Vytautas Landsbergis frequently 
expressed himself in the same spirit on the subject of 
Kaliningrad Oblast. Members of right-wing movements, even if 
they are not speaking directly of the need to transfer this 
region to Lithuania, are hinting it. And on this plane R. 
Ozolas' arguments are no great surprise. 
  The right-wing newspaper LETUVOS AYDAS states that 
Karaljaucius (that is what it calls Kaliningrad) should be 
demilitarized and its fate should be decided by an agreement 
between Russia, Lithuania, and Germany. "At Potsdam Lesser 
Lithuania was handed over to the control of the USSR proceeding 
from extensive scientific material which argued that this 
territory is ancient Lithuanian land," the newspaper asserts. 
"The Kremlin leaders initially planned to hand it over to 
Lithuania but later had second thoughts and by an edict of 7 
April 1946 Lesser Lithuania was joined to the Russian Soviet 
Federated Socialist Republic and called Kaliningrad Oblast." 
  This oversimplified assessment of a very complex historical 
moment issued in many thousands of copies can indeed give rise 
to quite specific feelings among some Lithuanian citizens. What 
about the fact that at that time Koenigsberg had been German for 
700 years? That the Prussian tribe subjugated by the Teutons in 
the 13th century was a Baltic tribe -- related to the 
Lithuanians but not Lithuanian? In my view the numerous 
indications that elements of Lithuanian culture are present in 
the region are also unproductive. So what? What if the Slavs 
were to search for traces of their own culture in other regions 
of the former USSR and not on Russian territory?

  [Text] The Lithuanian Government has approved a proposal by 
the Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Europe [as heard 
-- EBRD] to carry out in Lithuania a program aimed at improving 
the financial and economic state of Lithuania's industrial 
enterprises. The program provides for the appropriation of up to 
2 million dollars to five state companies to make them 
competitive. 
  The Lithuanian Economics Ministry says the program has come 
too late and should have been put into effect about a year and a 
half ago. The main reason for this is the lack of medium-sized 
and still opportune enterprises, because the Reconstruction Bank 
does not want to finance very large companies.

  [Text] The government has announced a draft to the active 
national defense service. Under the 18 March resolution, up to 
3,500 young men born in 1975, who have already turned 19, as 
well as other senior citizens of the Republic of Lithuania, who 
must perform their active national defense service, will be 
conscripted in April and May. At the same time, servicemen who 
have served their full term will be transferred to the reserve. 
  Conscripts will be trained and armed in accordance with the 
rules set by the National Defense Ministry [KAM] and the 
Interior Ministry, and will perform their service in Interior 
Ministry units or other places designated by the KAM. The 
resolution reads that the KAM and the Health Ministry must 
ensure that medical commissions in cities and regions carry out 
thorough examinations. The Interior Ministry is authorized to 
assist territorial headquarters of the KAM Volunteer National 
Defense Service in regions and districts in executing the draft 
to the active national defense service.

  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 29, BNS -- The Socialist Party of 
Lithuania, "a resolute political party of the working people," 
was founded in Vilnius Saturday [27 March] by a unanimous vote 
of 68 delegates. 
  Albinas Visockas, chairman of the new party, said its 
creation is "an expression of people's despair." In his words, 
the Socialist Party is "inseparable from the scientific theory 
of Karl Marx." 
  The socialists condemn anti-communism as "a means to destroy 
ideological opponents politically and morally. In our view, to 
compare communism with brutal fascism is nothing but criminal 
populism and incitement of low instincts of a crowd." 
  The congress adopted a resolution, under the headline 
"Anti-communism-a source of confusion and global instability," 
which will reportedly be sent to the United Nations and the Pope. 
  According to the resolution, time has come to evaluate 
"objectively and honestly" the doctrine of communism on an 
international level. The socialists regret that the word 
"communist" has become a synonym of "evildoer and criminal," and 
anti-communism has turned into a state policy in Lithuania. 
  In another resolution, the socialists said the ban imposed 
on 
activities of the communist party in Lithuania was an 
"antidemocratic act" and a "general political amnesty" should be 
declared. 
  The communist party was outlawed in Lithuania after a failed 
Soviet coup attempt in January 1991. 
  Visockas, a Vilnius bakery worker, intends to run for a 
vacant seat in the parliament, which appeared after Algirdas 
Brazauskas, former leader of the ruling Lithuanian Democratic 
Labor Party [LDDP], was elected as president. 
  Representatives of the LDDP, the reorganized Lithuanian 
communist party, welcomed the appearance of a new party calling 
the socialists "dear comrades." The socialists held their 
congress at the LDDP headquarters in Vilnius. 
  People aged between 30 and 50 with secondary education made 
up a greater part of the delegates, who reportedly represented 
429 party members. Workers make up the nucleus of the new 
party, which also has several farmers and jobless people among 
its members.

<F P=106> [Article by Virginijus Gaivenis: "The Lost Millions"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Under the 18 May 1992 resolution of the 
Government of the Republic of Lithuania, the former Supreme 
Council Security Department received $870,000 to supply the 
Volunteer National Defense Service with defense and 
technological facilities not produced in Lithuania. After the 
Prosecutor General's Office had expressed interest in the 
utilization of this sum, officials from the State Inspection 
Department carried out an inspection and submitted their 
conclusions in late January. Thus, it turned out that the 
government headed by G. Vagnorius had allocated $870,000 to the 
Security Department, while the acquired special purpose 
facilities (arms, ammunition, bulletproof jackets, and so on) 
were worth only $393,705. Inspectors failed to establish where 
the remaining $476,295 had gone, because they did not find any 
documents in the former Security Department and banks justifying 
the utilization of the residual sum. 
  The Lithuanian Bank Department of Hard Currency Operations 
transferred the entire $870,000 to the account of the 
London-based firm "Ligistics [as published] Development Inc" in 
the Bank Hapoalim back on 26 May 1992. The current Lithuanian 
Bank leadership also confirms this fact. However, none of the 
leaders of this bank or the Security Department dared provide 
information about the size of the remaining sum in the firm's 
account, because the very contract for the purchase of all these 
special facilities is missing. According to state inspectors, 
the current government must establish the total of the unused 
residue allocated to the Supreme Council Security Department and 
retrieve it. This opinion is also shared by the Lithuanian 
Prosecutor General's Office which sent a letter to the prime 
minister immediately after receiving the conclusions of the 
State Inspection Department, requesting him to render assistance 
and authorize the Lithuanian Bank to examine the actual 
situation. Recently, the Prosecutor General's Office received a 
reply from Prime Minister A. Slezevicius which reads that 
"executing the government decision of 3 February 1994, the 
Lithuanian Bank reports that it failed to acquire any additional 
information concerning the utilization of the $870,000 which the 
Government of Lithuania allocated to the Supreme Council 
Security Department and later transferred to the account of the 
London-based firm "Ligistics Development Inc." in the Bank 
Hapoalim, and the residue money. A. Slezevicius maintains that 
due to the negligence of the requirements for accounts of 
material assets, book-keeping, and balance accounts, the 
Republic of Lithuania incurred a $476,295 loss. [passage 
omitted] 
  Some sources maintain that A. Skucas, former chief of the 
Supreme Council Security Department, recently paid a visit to 
the Prosecutor General's Office and tried to persuade it that 
the total of $870,000 had been spent to buy special facilities 
in the United States. However, the U.S. State Department and 
special services banned the shipment of arms to Lithuania 
because the country allegedly did not want to impair its 
relations with Russia....

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mass Media and Politics"] </F>
  [Text] On Monday [21 March], members of the Association of 
Independent Radio and Television Stations met with 
representatives of opposition parties in the Seimas 
[parliament]. Association President G. Babravicius explained 
his claims to the government and requested the lawmakers' 
intercession. Leaders of radio and television stations are not 
content with the fact that the Seimas has deprived the 
electronic mass media of the right to privatize the facilities 
they have leased thus far. They also stated that the government 
resolution on licensing telecommunication activities runs 
counter to the law on enterprises. "The government's actions 
violate the Constitution which states that the mass media cannot 
be monopolized," said Radio Center leader R. Pleikys. 
Independent radio and television stations are also dissatisfied 
with the ban on air commercials on holidays and memorial days -- 
such a flaw is incorporated in the draft law on the mass media. 
  "The conflict between independent radio and television 
stations and the government is almost free of a political 
tinge," claimed Association President G. Babravicius. However, 
the representatives of the opposition firmly diverted the 
conversation to political issues. According to G. Vagnorius, 
chairman of the Homeland Union Executive Council, "one must 
often look for political motives behind economic difficulties as 
well." Seimas deputies proposed that a decision should be 
adopted on whether to apply political or technical measures. 
Journalists maintained, however, that the press, which is 
seeking the status of a fourth power, will never find a common 
language with the first two. "We have no illusions that a 
change in the parties in power will entail a change in their 
attitude toward the mass media. First of all, we need a 
compilation of rules," stated the representatives of radio and 
television looking for an intercession.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- During their regular 
meetings, the leaders of the houses of the Russian Parliament 
and the president "look for approaches to basic decisions which 
are subsequently elaborated," Federation Council Speaker 
Vladimir Shumeyko told journalists at a roundtable meeting here 
on Wednesday. 
  In response to an ITAR-TASS question about his meeting with 
Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday, Shumeyko remarked that such meetings 
are held periodically when the president needs to discuss some 
matters with law-makers. 
  The Federation Council speaker is confident that the houses 
of parliament "should not be used as an instrument of the 
struggle for power." There is no sense in parliament's 
decision-making "for decision's sake". 
  Decisions made at the state level should be complied with, 
Shumeyko stressed, adding that it is easier to coordinate 
matters at the very first level of the decision making process. 
"Boris Yeltsin did not make any recommendations to the 
Federation Council," Shumeyko specified. 
  Touching upon the notorious coup scenarios, Shumeyko 
described them as an "attempt to undermine the situation in the 
country in order to catch fish in troubled waters." He believes 
that the situation in Russia is now stable enough, and that 
attempts to upset it by such methods look ridiculous and won't 
pan out.

"Into Europe by the Front Door"] 
  [Text] Paris -- Last week a Russian parliamentary 
delegation headed by Federation Council Chairman Viktor Shumeyko 
visited France at the Interparliamentary Union's invitation. At 
a press conference devoted to the visit's results the chairman 
reported that he had met with Catherine Lalumiere, secretary 
general of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg. 
  "Past Russian parliamentarians," Shumeyko said, "have 
insisted that Russia must become a Council member because it is 
so big and great and must therefore have an exception made for 
it. We structured the discussion differently. If Russia meets 
the necessary criteria for admission, we will be glad to be 
accepted into the Council." The Council president replied that 
this question would most probably be decided after the 
parliament's summer recess. 
  Shumeyko said in response to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA 
correspondent's question about Boris Nikolayevich's health that 
certain circles needed a campaign to discredit the president in 
order to destabilize the situation. According to him the 
president is a real "workaholic." He can get up at 0200 and 
work.

principles laid in the agreement". Concrete issues are to be 
elaborated at round-table discussions and by ad-hoc work groups, 
the speaker told reporters on Wednesday. 
  Shumeyko stressed that the agreement should be implemented 
only in full compliance with the Russian Constitution and laws. 
The Conciliation Commission will be empowered to examine and 
make public cases of agreement violations by any side, and even 
to demand that the given side be excluded from the signatories. 
  The upper house speaker views the agreement on civil accord 
in Russia as a document of paramount political and social 
importance. But he warned against regarding this document as "a 
substition of the existing Constitution". 
  Shumeyko told reporters that the agreement had been put on 
the agenda of the Federation Council's session scheduled to open 
next week. He called to speed up work on the text, because "if 
we try to bring it to perfection, it may never see the light of 
the day", the speaker emphasised. He believes that the text of 
the draft agreement should be distributed among upper house 
deputies. If they agree to it, they may instruct the Federation 
Council speaker to take part in its filalizing in coordination 
with other structures. A similar procedure should take place in 
the parliament's lower house, as well as in all parties and 
movements, Shumeyko said.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1545 GMT on 29 March carries the 
"At First Hand" program featuring a nine-minute recorded 
interview with head of the presidential administration Sergey 
Filatov by an unidentified correspondent. The date and location 
of the interview is not given. 
  Asked about the poor turnout at the local elections, Filatov 
attributes it to the current hardship, antipathy, and 
disorientation of voters after Zhirinovskiy's success in the 
last elections and also to the apolitical mood in the cities and 
oblast capitals where the representative bodies of power tend to 
consist of representatives from the more politically active 
rural localities. Filatov points out the need for the president 
to define more precisely the powers of the bodies of local 
self-government, which are established in the constitution as 
separate from bodies of state power. He says that there were 
many meetings with city mayors regarding the local elections, 
and that "Yeltsin met halfway the numerous requests not to be 
rigid in fixing the dates for holding these elections, as was 
the case earlier in the spring of this year, to give the 
opportunity -- as the ground work is done, as the awareness is 
awakened as to what kind of power the local level want to have 
-- to complete this in the autumn. This is what he has done 
with this edict." 
  Filatov states that they have set themselves an April 
deadline to draw up the legislation and May for submitting to 
the State Duma the fundamentals for structuring local 
self-government. 
  Asked about the rumors of early presidential elections and 
the grounds for the rumors, Filatov says, "I can only see one 
reason: Many different candidates have appeared who very much 
want to try their strength and be elected president. There is 
absolutely no juridical basis for that." Filatov then goes on 
to list the various clauses of the constitution that support the 
president remaining in office for his full term. 
  Filatov then goes on to the presidential edict of 21 March 
appointing Yuriy Yarov as the coordinator of the Russian 
tripartite commission for regulating socio-economic relations. 
He stresses the importance of the commission's functions as a 
general mediator. 
  Asked about Yeltsin's intentions, Filatov says he is working 
intensively on agreements, preparing for his trip to Spain, and 
is set to deal with current problems. He adds that the 
president is in a good mood.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F>
Federation Government Apparatus and Federal Minister, by unnamed 
correspondent; date and place of interview not stated: "The 
State and Its Apparatus"] 
  [Text] At a recent government Presidium session, Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, speaking of ways of reducing the expenditure part 
of the budget, noted that the state management apparatus has 
become unjustifiably swollen. Where has the state apparatus 
become "swollen?" What today is the position of state 
employees? Can the struggle for sectorial and departmental 
interests be shifted into the channel of civilized lobbying? At 
a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent's request Federal Minister 
Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government 
apparatus, considers these questions. 
  As for the reorganization of the Government apparatus, its 
reduction, the merging of departments, and the creation of new 
ones, it is still early to speak of the results of this work. 
Work is in full swing. If we are speaking of the state 
management apparatus, which has indeed over recent years come 
close to the million mark, then such an enormous increase 
occurred through the increase in the regions -- in Russia's 
krays, oblasts, and rayons. After all, there are about 350,000 
officials at rayon management level alone, as was mentioned by 
government head Viktor Chernomyrdin. And the federal organs' 
apparatus has not grown for several years and numbers about 
35,000. 
  Thus the state apparatus has been "swollen" because of the 
regions, which under the Federation Treaty are independent in 
their decisions. The federal organs exercise less and less 
control over them and it remains for us only to "collate the 
statistics." 
  It s known that the main task of the government apparatus is 
to prepare its decisions and the second, no less important, is 
to monitor the fulfillment of these decisions. But naturally it 
is impossible to monitor all government instructions. After all 
last year alone there were nearly 48,000 of them. But the most 
important, on which the state of affairs in the national economy 
and other spheres depends, are monitored, and quite toughly. 
  As for lobbying, perhaps I shall say something almost 
criminal, but I myself have been lobbied. But... in a civilized 
manner. For our country the concept of lobbying and lobbying 
itself is something new. Lobbying is only emerging and has not 
yet assumed the form of legislative acts. perhaps it is for 
that reason that Russian lobbying is of an uncivilized nature. 
On the other hand, for instance, a deputy elected from some 
region to the State Duma has undoubtedly been lobbied. And that 
is understandable, even in purely human terms. Why was he 
elected if he not only will not represent his region's interest 
but will not "promote" them? 
  But when it is a case of "promoting" some document to the 
government to make it make an important decision and the 
document itself is raw and unfinished as they say, then that 
kind of lobbying is blatantly uncivilized and is based mainly on 
amicable relations with someone from the government leadership. 
  And in this connection we can dwell on work with ministries 
and departments. Demands on the preparation of documents 
submitted for the government's examination have now been made 
sufficiently tough. Incidentally, according to existing norms 
all documents which are to be examined by the government are 
unfailingly agreed on in advance with the ministry and 
department. Actually, under the existing situation, only an 
agreed document is examined in the government, and the role and 
task of the government apparatus is merely to legalize it and 
report it. But unfortunately a situation often takes shape in 
which an attempt is made by hook or by crook to "promote" an 
unfinished or, as we say, a "raw" document. At that moment 
people do not think of the problems which will unfailingly arise 
and could have various and sometimes grave consequences. 
  That is why the apparatus has now considerably toughened 
demands on documents of this nature. Unfinished documents are 
simply sent back, which of itself is already a serious warning. 
  Now about state employees. It is no secret that there is 
always a problem with good and well qualified cadres, especially 
now when there is a temptation to get more money by working in 
commercial structures. But the president has signed the edict 
on introducing the statute on state service and the necessary 
normative documents are being elaborated to implement this 
statute. These are the fundamental legal documents giving a 
state employee certain guarantees for the entire period of his 
work in state service. And when they begin to operate the 
attitude toward the state employee will change fundamentally. 
  Has the government apparatus work style changed? Undoubtedly 
it has, for life does not stand still, everything is changing 
rapidly. Of course, work in the apparatus is complex and takes 
up almost all one's time. But if you succeed then you feel 
great satisfaction. Probably this can be said by anyone of his 
work to which a man actually devotes almost all his life.

"Everyone Is a Wimp But Me"] 
  [Text] "It is decisive people, not wimps [khlyupiki], who 
should run the country," Lev Ubozhko, leader of the Conservative 
Party, has said. On 27 March the party's third congress 
nominated the well known dissident as candidate for president. 
  At the initiative of Lev Grigoryevich himself, the congress 
demanded without too much talk that the results of the 
"antidemocratic and rigged" elections for the Federal Assembly 
be annulled and the amnestied coup plotters be put back behind 
bars. Most important, the "communist" Chernomyrdin government 
should resign and presidential elections should be called to 
elect a new head of state. 
  It turned out that Boris Yeltsin is "soft as wax" and that 
he 
"has been continuing Gorbachev's line toward appeasing the 
reactionary forces and has struck a secret deal with the 
criminal Rutskoy and the fascist Zhirinovskiy." According to 
Ubozhko, "Messrs. Yeltsin and Zhirinovskiy go to the baths 
together once a month, and after taking a steam bath they would 
not mind playing a game of checkers." As a result, it turned 
out that "the king does not have anything on," and what he does 
is to sacrifice his allies, apparently confusing checkers with 
give-away. 
  Any "infection," Lev Grigoryevich thinks, should be nipped 
in 
the bud by introducing presidential rule. He promises to mark 
his coming to power by the immediate firing or even exiling of 
all members of the old party nomenklatura who sabotage reform. 
As for racketeers, he promised to get rid of them within a 
month by arming all entrepreneurs to a man.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- "The party, now being formed 
on the basis of the Democratic Russia movement, will be closer 
to the centre of the political scale than the party that is now 
being set up by Yegor Gaydar on the basis of the `Russia's 
Choice' movement, which will sooner be liberal-conservative," 
co-chairman of the Democratic Russia movement Lev Ponomarev told 
ITAR-TASS. 
  In Ponomarev's opinion, efforts to guarantee the social 
protection of the population will be the main distinction of the 
Democratic Russia party. The Democratic Russia movement has 
still not officially announced its reorganisation into a party. 
However, the decision of the latest plenary meeting of its 
council of representatives to draw up lists of movement members 
should be regarded as a step in this direction. The question of 
whether to set up a party or not will be decided by the 
movement's congress. It was decided to leave unchanged the 
principle of collective membership and the status of supporters, 
not wishing to be registered as official members, until the 
convocation of the congress. The regional organisations of the 
Democratic Russia movement will independently decide on the 
extent of their participation in the formation of local party 
cells. 
  Ponomarev makes no bones of the fact that this decision was 
prompted by Gaydar's initiative to set up a party. The 
movement, set up about three years ago, has for a long time 
provided massive backing to the Russian reforms. It campaigned 
in one bloc with the "Russia's Choice" during the recent 
elections. Nevertheless, Democratic Russia has still not been 
offered to become part and parcel of Gaydar's party, which, in 
Ponomarev's opinion, would have been quite natural. 
  "We have given altruistic support to the Gaydar government 
for a very long time and have even backed his shock therapy 
idea. However, both they and the leadership of Russia as a whole 
have failed to do the main thing -- explain to the nation the 
essence of the ongoing reforms. They also forgot to guarantee 
the social protection of the Russian citizens," Ponomarev said, 
assessing the looming split between the two previously main 
allies of the democratic camp. However, he stressed that 
members of the Democratic Russia movement still wished to rally 
all the democrats, including the "Russia's Choice", 
"Yavlinskiy-Boldarev-Lukin", "December 12", and the Democratic 
Russia parliamentary factions. 
  Time will show whether these former allies will become 
rivals 
or not, and how effective the movement will be in its new form. 
In the meantime, only about one thousand people have signed up 
as members of the Democratic Russia movement during the few days 
of registration in ten municipal constituencies. According to 
Ponomarev's assessment at least 40-50 thousand Russians may join 
the new party.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleg Savelyev, VTSIOM sociologist: "Yeltsin Is </F>
in the Lead Again"] 
  [Text] In an express MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS-commissioned 
poll of approximately 1,300 residents of the capital, conducted 
by the Moscow branch of the All-Russian Center for Public 
Opinion Research [VTSIOM], the answers to one of the questions 
in the survey -- "Who would you like to see as president of 
Russia?" -- were distributed as follows (in percentages): 
  B. Yeltsin -- 14 
  V. Zhirinovskiy -- 5 
  G. Yavlinskiy -- 5 
  Ye. Gaydar -- 4 
  A. Sobchak -- 3 
  A. Rutskoy -- 3 
  M. Gorbachev -- 3 
  V. Chernomyrdin -- 1 
  Other -- 17 
  Not sure -- 45 
  B. Yeltsin as Russia's president is more often the choice of 
people in the arts, pensioners and women in general, persons 
over 55 with incomplete higher and higher education, and those 
who were active in the 12 December 1993 elections and voted on 
party slates for Russia's Choice and the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord. 
  V. Zhirinovskiy as president is relatively more often the 
choice of the military and police, managers at various levels, 
workers in commercial structures, men in general (twice more 
often than women), persons under 40 with secondary education, 
and those who were very active in the elections and voted 
predominantly for Zhirinovskiy's and Travkin's parties. 
  G. Yavlinskiy as president is more often the preference of 
the military and police and people between age 25 and 40 in 
general, with higher education, who took part in the elections 
at the average Moscow level and voted for Yabloko. 
  Ye. Gaydar as president would be preferred more often by 
students, employees in commercial structures, arts and non-arts 
specialists, persons under age 55 with incomplete or complete 
higher education who were active in the elections and cast the 
most votes against the political associations offered in party 
slates and for Russia's Choice. 
  The other "presidential candidates" had an insignificant 
number of supporters in this poll, which does not allow analysis 
of their socio-demographic makeup.

<F P=106> [Report by Salam Musafir in Moscow] </F>
  [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the information 
policy and media committee [title as published] at the Russian 
parliament, says the growing audacity of pro-Zionist and 
pro-Israel circles in Russia is such that they are pursuing a 
systematic campaign against the Russian people that could 
conceivably culminate in horrible massacres. 
  A close political aide to President Boris Yeltsin, Mr. 
Poltoranin said in an interview with AL-RA'Y: I fear the 
Russian people may lose their patience with this filthy effort. 
While the Russian people have the capacity to endure hunger, 
misery, and deprivation, they will not remain silent for long 
when Zionists trample their national pride underfoot through the 
news media they are seeking to control. 
  In a a recent television appearance, Poltoranin recalled, he 
said that by speaking the language of the Jewish concentration 
camps, the Zionists are fueling so-called anti-Semitism in 
Russia. By temperament, the Russian people, he emphasized, do 
not discriminate against others on ethnic, racial, or religious 
grounds. These circles, however, are trying our people's 
patience. If a massacre should take place, the Zionist lobby 
active in the media must take the blame in full. The Zionist 
circles have gone too far in insulting the Russian national 
dignity, he added. 
  Poltoranin disclosed that the salary of the Russian 
television Hebrew correspondent is paid by the Israeli 
Government and so it was not surprising that his reports have an 
anti-Arab and pro-Israel slant. When I intimated to the Russian 
television's director my surprise that the cash-strapped station 
had no correspondents in the country's provinces, while it 
maintained one in Israel, he revealed to me that the latter gets 
his pay from Israel. 
  This affair, which as a Russian parliamentary committee 
chairman I will not condone, is legally and politically 
insulting to Russia's national dignity and prestige, Mr. 
Poltoranin said. 
  He would keep the fight against these circles, which he 
regretted are seeking to isolate President Yeltsin after they 
secured influential positions within his entourage. 
  I am confident that Mr. Yeltsin will soon heed the danger 
this represents, and will come to recognize that a halt must be 
called to the Zionist-inspired defamation campaign against 
Russian national pride. 
  He indicated that by April, the Russian parliament will pass 
a law regulating the activities of the media organs, 
particularly the competing radio and television stations, which, 
he said have turned into tools manipulated by the Zionist lobby. 
The parliament, he added, will decree the formation of a 
federal, central consultative council to administer radio and 
television. 
  There is a consensus in parliament and an initial acceptance 
by Mr. Yeltsin that I take charge of this council. We will then 
put things in order and ban this feverish activity, because 
Russia will not countenance becoming an occupied country. 
  At the parliament's initiative, a committee was formed to 
look into where the money came from to fund anti-Arab and 
anti-Russian television programs, Mr. Poltoranin disclosed. Let 
me tell you that we will not have our media channels turn into 
mouthpieces for cheap Zionist propaganda, he added. 
  I asked him about Yeltsin's feelings toward what is 
happening 
in Russia. Poltoranin said that by virtue of many complex -- 
both objective and subjective -- factors, President Yeltsin is 
suffering from symptoms of a lack of concentration, more 
precisely drift, because the situation is far removed from the 
way he had hoped would turn out two years ago when he launched 
his economic reform program. 
  Two years ago, Poltoranin continued, I put forward to Mr. 
Yeltsin a moderate, sober, gradualist reform plan to lead up to 
a full- fledged market economy. Gaydar, on the other hand, 
proposed a shortcut, which Yeltsin, for purely personal reasons, 
adopted and, which, in the end proved a failure and produced 
serious political and social eruptions that the president is now 
seeking to contain lest there be a total collapse. Yeltsin's 
awakening came rather too late, which, has, for the past months, 
put him in a depressed state of mind that I have watched at 
close range. It has affected his health considerably. 
  Poltoranin said the president's illness is not a secret. He 
has been suffering from an acute infection of the brain vessels 
for several years. He has always complained of this. 
Naturally, his case is exacerbating with age. He added: 
Still, I do not think it is a hopeless case, although it 
affects his vigor and activity in one way or another. He added: 
Until recently, we have been practicing tennis with the 
president, his favorite hobby. I think he needs more rest. 
Poltoranin said what is more serious in the president's latest 
conduct is that he listened to tendentious advisers and shut 
himself off from the people because his entourage does not 
provide him with correct information on what is taking place in 
the country. 
  Russia will see large-scale labor strikes after the 
formation 
of regional and federal committees all over the country. These 
committees will first demand early presidential elections, or 
more accurately, the dismissal of Yeltsin. Actually, these 
strikes are legal because the workers have not received their 
salaries for months. The commercial establishments, like Moost 
[name as transliterated], which finances several Zionist 
television programs, confiscates the state budget funds and uses 
them in commercial deals. After making huge profits, it pays a 
small part of the wages and salaries which, in turn, lose their 
purchasing power due to inflation. Thus, these establishments 
play a major destructive role, protected and supported by 
ministers in the government and by Ilyushin, the president's 
close aide who represents the interests of the ruling 
establishment. 
  Regrettably, the president, due to the objective and 
personal 
factors I have mentioned, does not have an accurate or clear 
idea about what is going on around him. But when the street 
factor simmers and popular anger bursts out as a result of these 
policies, it will be too late to do anything. He added: 
Popular pressure may lead to early elections and this is 
something the president is not giving due consideration right 
now. 
  Poltoranin said Gaydar's parliamentary bloc, Russia First, 
is 
a political movement with no future. Elaborating, he said: The 
bloc is suffering from a major split that will surface within 
the next few weeks. This bloc includes opportunists seeking 
senior positions. It also includes sincere deputies who blame 
it for its inactivity and unclear political and economic 
programs. Those deputies will form their own parliamentary 
bloc. Once they have done so, I expect them to dismiss Gaydar 
and the small group supporting him. 
  The Russian national factor also plays a role in the 
collapse 
of Russia First because Gaydar refuses to deal with sincere 
Russians. He prefers to deal with educated Moscovites. These 
include many representatives of the lobby to which I have 
referred. He said he personally does not desire a split in 
Russia First, but reality is stronger than wishes. 
  In his interview with AL-RA'Y, Poltoranin strongly condemned 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron and said: The bestial 
action perpetrated by an occupation settler was not a transient 
incident. The regime that sanctioned the horrible massacre 
should be taken to account because Israeli policy, which is 
hostile to the rights of the Arabs of Palestine, is fertile soil 
for acts of repression, terrorism, and the killing of innocent 
people. He indicated he will ask the Russian parliament to 
discuss the situation in the Middle East and draw up a sound 
policy for fruitful cooperation with the Arab states. 
  He added: I said on more than one occasion that the Russian 
Foreign Ministry policy in the region is limping along on 
Western legs and that Russia should adopt an independent policy 
based on its national interests in the region, which is an area 
of important strategic geopolitical interests for our country. 
Russia has relinquished its interests in the Middle East to 
accommodate the aims of those forces that harbor evil to Russia 
and the Arabs. 
  He said: The West, led by the United States, offered Russia 
nothing but bad advise. It is occupying positions Russia has 
abandoned one after another. Russia has only one option, 
namely, alliance with the Arab states and the Pacific Ocean 
states so an effective political and economic alliance can be 
established to end to the imbalance in world power and to 
confront the U.S. hegemony and the chauvinist expansionist U.S. 
policy in the world. 
  Concluding, Poltoranin said Russia should toll the alarm in 
the Security Council vis-a-vis Israel's possession of nuclear 
weapons because the Israeli nuclear factor threatens the 
national security of Russia as well as that of the Arabs. He 
said: Using double standards in dealing with states' possession 
of weapons of mass destruction should be terminated.

<F P=106> [Lidiya Lukyanova report: "We Are Threatened With a </F>
`Typist's Option'"] 
  [Text] The Secretariat of the Russian Journalists Union 
has decided periodically to hold journalistic hearings: As of 
now it will thus discuss draft government laws and resolutions 
which regulate the life and activity of the press, as well as 
conflicts related to the privatization or corporatization of 
media outlets. Hearing organizers intend to enforce the presence 
of both sides concerned: authors of the documents and those who 
will have to live by them, as well as experts. 
  Russian Journalists Union Chairman Vsevolod Bogdanov thus 
substantiated the need for joint discussions: 
  "When it concerns ourselves, the journalists are known to 
swing their fists after a fight, that is to say, when a draft 
has already become law or a resolution been passed. It is 
always more difficult to remedy or change anything than to 
prevent in good time a mistake from occurring." 
  The first hearing took place at the Journalists' House on 25 
March. It discussed propositions for creating a Russian federal 
TV and radio broadcasting service. In the expression of Aleksey 
Simonov, who presided over the discussion, this document seems 
to be roaming, moving about the government and Duma offices, but 
all attempts to find and invite its authors for the debate have 
proved futile. The authors prefer to remain anonymous. Thus, 
two Ostankino TV and Radio Company chiefs, Valentin Lazutkin and 
Aleksandr Yakovlev, have denied its paternity. Speakers cited 
abundantly the absent Aleksandr Nikolayevich Yakovlev, who had 
assured them that he had not endorsed any such draft or 
presented it to the State Duma or the government. Yakovlev 
described this draft as a typist's option. 
  It needs to be made clear: a very highly placed typist and 
moreover very ambitious, to the point of diktat which was 
established over TV during the rule of the CPSU Central 
Committee. In other words, again censorship, monopoly of 
information and all the rest of it. If the proposed draft is 
approved, something like the Vremya program will reappear on TV, 
excluding from the air waves any other news programs. And not 
even a trace of competition. Enough!... 
  The participants in the discussion made this conclusion: It 
is necessary for the journalists to work out and propose to the 
lawmaker a mechanism for preparing all documents bearing on 
press activity. Without the participation of the sides 
concerned and behind the backs of TV and radio journalists, it 
is impossible to elaborate draft laws regimenting their work 
conditions in a rule-of- law state. 
  The Russian Journalists Union leadership has been tasked to 
make this point of view known to the two branches.

  [Text] At the Information and Press Department of the 
Russian Defense Ministry it has been said that the SUNDAY TIMES 
report referring to anonymous intelligence sources on the 
creation in Russia of a new biological weapon does not 
correspond to the facts. 
  Lieutenant General Valentin Yevstigneyev, deputy commander 
of 
troops for radiation shielding and chemical and biological 
warfare defense, stated that in accordance with the Russian 
president's Edict No. 390, dated 11 April 1992, all work running 
counter to the requirements of the 1972 convention banning 
biological weapons has been halted.

  [Text] Deputy head of Russian troops for chemical and 
biological defenses General Valentin Yevstigneyev has described 
as groundless any suspicion about Moscow's violation of the 
international ban on the development, production or storage of 
biological weapons. 
  He was commenting on a Sunday Times publication which 
alleged, referring to intelligence sources and three Russian 
"defectors," that the Russian Defence Ministry was engaged in 
the development of biological weapons behind Yeltsin's back. 
  Yevstigneyev does not consider the paper's report unusual 
given the background of continued Western accusations against 
Russia concerning the developing of such weapons. He said that 
in the past, such campaigns were timed to coincide with major 
international talks on banning biological or chemical weapons in 
an effort to divert attention from the West's own programs which 
were in violation of the 1972 convention. 
  The general said the Sunday Times publication had emerged in 
the run up to a session by a preparatory committee intended to 
clear the ground for a special conference for measures to verify 
the compliance with the 1972 convention. Moscow is expected to 
continue work on possible verification measures at that session, 
Yevstigneyev said.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Lieutenant General of Medical Services Valentin </F>
Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian Federation 
Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection 
Forces, "at the request of the Russian Defense Ministry 
Information and Press Directorate": "The Military Do Not 
Deceive Their Commander in Chief"] 
  [Text] The UK newspaper THE SUNDAY TIMES published an 
article the other day which asserts, citing anonymous 
intelligence sources and the testimony of three "defectors," 
that the Russian Defense Ministry is carrying out work on a 
program for the creation of biological weapons without the 
knowledge of the country's president. 
  At the request of the Russian Defense Ministry Information 
and Press Directorate, Lieutenant General of Medical Services 
Valentin Ivanovich Yevstigneyev, deputy chief of the Russian 
Federation Defense Ministry Radiation, Chemical, and Biological 
Protection Forces, comments on these assertions. 
  [Yevstigneyev] First of all I wish to note that the 
continuing campaign in the West to accuse Russia of carrying out 
work on the creation of biological weapons is patently intended 
to divert public attention from their own programs which 
contravene the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of Biological 
and Toxin Weapons. 
  As is well known, Russia advocates the setting up of a 
large-scale mechanism for verification of compliance with this 
convention. But such a mechanism is evidently not in the 
interests of those who are continuing to improve a scientific, 
technical, and industrial potential which could be used for the 
production of biological weapons. 
  We have observed that peaks in the activeness of this 
campaign coincide, as a rule, with major international talks 
concerning the 1972 Convention. The present press item is no 
exception. It came out on the eve of a session of the 
preparatory committee for a special conference to examine 
possible measures for verification of compliance with the 1972 
Convention, at which the Russian side intends to continue work 
aimed at setting up a mechanism for verification of compliance 
with the said treaty. 
  As for the accusations against the Russian Defense Ministry, 
I wish to remind the author of the SUNDAY TIMES item that in 
accordance with Edict No. 390 of the President of the Russian 
Federation, 11 April 1992, all work contrary to the requirements 
of the 1972 Convention was stopped. Verification of the 
fulfillment of the said edict on Russian territory is carried 
out by the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and 
Biological Weapons under the President of the Russian Federation. 
  In 1993 amendments were made to legislation, making 
provision 
for criminal accountability for the development, production, 
acquisition, or storage of biological weapons. 
  Every year our country submits to the United Nations an 
exhaustive report on its biological facilities and activity 
associated with protection against biological weapons. Russia's 
biological facilities, including those belonging to the Defense 
Ministry, have repeatedly been visited by representatives of the 
mass media and the local authorities and by foreign experts. 
  Back in November 1992 an independent commission of leading 
Russian scientists and foreign experts visited the Institute of 
Ultrapure Biological Products, at which the United States and 
Britain suspected that work was being carried out on the 
"superplague" mentioned in the article. The commission found 
the institute's activity to be fully in accordance with the 
requirements of the 1972 Convention. Immediately following the 
completion of the commission's work, the U.S. and British 
representatives also voiced no complaints about the work being 
carried out at the Institute. 
  So any suspicions concerning violations by Russia of the ban 
on the development, production, or storage of biological weapons 
are completely unfounded.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krylovich </F>
and Vladimir Taranov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- Reports in British mass media 
about continued work on the development of biological weapons in 
Russia are to say the least surprising. Grigoriy Karasin, 
director of Foreign Ministry information and press department, 
stated this at today's briefing at the Foreign Ministry press 
center. 
  He said that in September 1992 the governments of three 
countries (Russia, the United States, and the UK) adopted a 
joint statement envisaging a complex of measures to allay the 
parties' concern over abidance by the 1972 convention banning 
biological weapons. As part of the implementation of these 
accords, U.S. and British experts have visited four nonmilitary 
biological facilities in Russia. The experts' conclusions by no 
means correspond with the claims made in the British press, 
Grigoriy Karasin noted. 
  It is regrettable that "information" of this kind is 
appearing at a time when Russia, the United States, and the UK, 
who are the depositories of the convention banning biological 
weapons, are making joint efforts to call a special convention 
on possible verification measures as early as this year, 
Grigoriy Karasin noted.

  [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- Biological arms rumors 
initiated by foreign mass media have political coloring, Russian 
academician Valentin Fedorov told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  According to the academician, recent open hearings at the 
State Duma on chemical disarmament excluded a possibility of 
speculations on this issue. He said that specialists disclosed 
all secrets of the "classified arms". 
  A refutation was also published by the Russian Defence 
Ministry, which clearly said that Russia does not develop or 
produce biological arms. 
  Academician Fedorov and other experts wonder why 
"sensations" 
casting aspersions on the Russian reputation appear at a time of 
Russian stabilization. Ecological problems are most often used 
in these "exposures". Rumors claiming alleged Russian holding 
of ecologically-dangerous weapons were spread under the pretext 
of environmental protection. According to well-informed 
sources, another attack to use consequences of Russian nuclear 
programs is being prepared. 
  In the opinion of specialists, chemical disarmament problems 
are concentrated around technologies for elimination of combat 
poison gases. They have an economic competition basis, and 
biological arms problems have a clear political coloring.

<F P=106> [Vladislav Kozyakov commentary] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for Russia's Defense Ministry flatly 
refused on Monday [28 March] the reports of Western media on the 
Russian military allegedly going ahead with the development of 
biological weapons. Our observer Vladislav Kozyakov has some 
details on this subject: 
  A spokesman for the information and press department made a 
statement from the Defense Ministry. He told ITAR-TASS that 
Russia is neither developing nor producing biological weapons. 
The statement was causing a sensation but absolutely groundless 
reports were made these days by some Western newspapers. For 
example, the SUNDAY TIMES published by the London-based TIMES 
produced a horrible picture alleging Russia has at its disposal 
some super plague powder which can destroy half a million people 
if 440 (?tonnes) of it were air dropped. What is more, the 
newspaper reported that the West has no antidote for this agent. 
It goes without saying that the report provided no evidence to 
prove this sensation. It couldn't be otherwise, since there is 
no such agent whatsoever. The author of the article, sent from 
Washington, Mr. James Adams, refers to the testimonies which had 
allegedly been made by three Russian defectors. One of them 
gave some information to the CIA, the other two did so to the 
British secret service. The names of these persons remain of 
course unidentified -- as a result nobody can verify whether 
these people really exist. 
  The developments remind one of the practices utilized by 
special services during the Cold War period, when the East and 
the West were competing for who is better at darkening its 
potential enemy. It was just at that time when the fabrications 
were spread all over the world about the AIDS virus having been 
released from the Pentagon laboratories to spread around the 
globe. 
  One can only wonder why even now the mass media is giving 
reports with misleading information capable of sowing distrust 
in international relations, the more so that the current pattern 
of relations between Russia, the United States, and Britain 
allows these countries to resolve their own problems -- 
especially those involved in mass destruction weapons -- 
proceeding from mutual frankness. It was a tripartite 
Russian-American-British agreement to achieve this concluded as 
early as 1992. [sentence as heard] The document of the agreement 
clearly stipulates all the sides concerned can inspect the 
facilities which had been used for the production of biological 
weapons. 
  The main question is: Why did this hoax about Russian 
biological weapons come into being just now? One of the 
possible answers to it can be found in the SUNDAY TIMES itself. 
This is evidence that some people are trying to create 
suspicion among Russian leadership. Could it be for this very 
reason that the conclusion can be drawn some Defense Ministry 
officials could ostensibly be deceiving the president in this 
respect? 
  However, another possibility is also quite plausible. In 
Washington and London there appear again some groups which would 
like to damage the prestige of Russia as a great democratic and 
peace-loving power. At the same time they are eager to put a 
fly into the ointment of the current process when constructive 
partnership among Washington, Moscow, and London is now gaining 
strength.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksey Vorotnikov: "Chemists' Needs Not </F>
Understood"] 
  [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Scientists at the State Institute 
of Organic Synthesis Technology, which is in the settlement of 
Shikhany in Saratov Oblast, have discovered an interesting 
method of destroying chemical weapons. They have proposed using 
toxic agents as raw materials for the production of materials 
needed by the national economy. In particular, the Volga 
scientists plan to obtain arsenic from lewisite. They have 
managed to organize the production of medicines and household 
chemical products here. 
  However, the funding of research work in the destruction of 
lethal weapons is proceeding poorly. Last year, just 17 million 
rubles were allocated for this purpose. The chemical workers 
are bewildered. How can this be? 
  For several months now staffers at the institute have not 
received their wages and the enormous collective has been forced 
to take administrative leave without pay. How can there be any 
talk of getting rid of weapons when there is no money to pay for 
their destruction?

  [Text] The head of the Russian state-owned Rosvooruzheniye 
company Victor Samoylov believes that this year the country can 
sell armaments and military hardware worth $20 Bn. Last year 
the figure was around $2 Bn. 
  In a Tuesday interview with Interfax Samoylov said that 
Russia did not lose the arms markets of the former Soviet Union 
and is ready to expand cooperation in this sphere with 
traditional partners: Arab countries, India, China, African and 
East European nations. 
  According to Samoylov, the volume of sales has been falling 
due to the form of payments. Since 1991 Russia has been 
demanding immediate payment and has stopped giving credits to 
countries for importing its armaments. 
  He said that last year the U.S. sold approximately the same 
amount of weapons at the same terms as Russia. "The $30 Bn 
volume of trade the Americans speak of is credited," he said. 
  Samoylov added that the USSR offered credits for 7 to 40 
years for the purchase of its weaponry. He also said that 
Russia lost between 10 and 15 billion dollars because of UN 
sanctions against its old partners: Libya and Iraq. He said 
Western states received compensation from the United Nations and 
the IMF for breaking off economic ties with the two countries. 
According to the head of Rosvooruzhenie, only Russia was left 
without compensation.

<F P=106> [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA-INFORM report under the "Border" </F>
rubric: "Kurils Apparently Shoot Their Bolt"] 
  [Text] The report from Viktor Ilyukhin, chief of the State 
Duma Security Committee, about Yeltsin's directive to prepare a 
schedule for the withdrawal of Border Guard Troops from the 
territory of the South Kuril Islands has turned into a sensation 
through the military's efforts. The issue was clouded by the 
Russian General Staff Operations Directorate and Border Guard 
Troops High Command, which flatly denied the existence of such a 
directive, although the Far East Military District commander 
confirmed the report in a confidential conversation. 
  Our sources in the Defense Ministry did not deny the 
existence of the directive, but stressed that it is not a 
question of withdrawing Border Guard Troops but of preparing a 
schedule for withdrawing troops in the event of "unforeseen 
circumstances." The question of whether the decision to hand 
over the islands to Japan can be classed as "unforeseen 
circumstances" remained unanswered. It was approximately in this 
form that the "sensation" started making the rounds in the pages 
of the Western press. 
  Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the State Duma Defense 
Committee, has now officially confirmed Ilyukhin's report. 
Since Cold War times a machinegun-artillery division has been 
stationed on the South Kurils, and it is this to which the 
president's directive evidently refers. A scandalous 
interpretation could have been avoided had the directive been 
immediately followed by explanations. Although one can 
understand the Defense Ministry -- it is too "hot" a topic. The 
only deep-water strait which is a nuclear-powered submarine 
channel is located in the area of the South Kurils.

<F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F>
Ministry] 
  [Text] An announcement by General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, that a special defense region will be created 
in Kaliningrad Oblast has provoked a wave of insinuations. This 
purely military issue, which is solely a matter of strengthening 
Russia's national security, is being whipped up by the European 
media. 
  In this connection, Yuriy Matochkin, head of administration 
in Kaliningrad Oblast, said the military in the amber region, 
together with their families, amounted to 10 percent of the 
population. After the defense region has been set up, the 
grouping of troops will number 26,000 people. This is 
considerably lower than allowed by the treaty on conventional 
arms in Europe.

  [Text] Barnaul -- An incident on a world scale occurred at 
a troop unit stationed in the vicinity of Barnaul. Private P., 
a native of Dagestan, shot a guard and seized a combat vehicle 
guarding missiles carrying nuclear warheads. You can imagine 
what the terrorist might have done had he reached the positions 
where the intercontinental ballistic missiles are held. 
  The regiment commander had difficulty persuading the soldier 
to surrender. Criminal proceedings have been instigated. But 
the conclusion is self-evident. Evidently, our valiant 
missilemen are having problems in obtaining fresh troops since 
unsuitable people are being admitted to secret installations.

salaries. INTERFAX learned from sources close to the Russian 
Defense Ministry that the Finance Ministry had set aside only 30 
percent of the amount needed. Therefore, about 70 percent of 
officers and warrant officers were left without their pay for 
March. Many of them had not received their salaries for 
February either.

  [Text] Russian First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin told Interfax that the country's military doctrine made 
no sense unless cash was made available to buy military 
hardware. "In order to cut the funds for defense factories, the 
government-approved state defense contracts would have to be 
revised," he said. 
  Kokoshin said that the Defense Ministry needed nearly Rbs 28 
trillion for purchases of military hardware in 1994 while the 
Finance Ministry was prepared to allocate one fifth of that 
amount. 
  He said that the Defense Ministry would press for its needs, 
in particular through the State Duma. He added that the 
ministry "had appropriate instructions on this score from the 
president and the prime minister." 
  Kokoshin listed numerous reasons for the shortage of funds 
in 
his ministry, notably slow restructuring of Russian industry, 
the need for it to maintain a large social role for its 
employees and low demand for the civilian production of 
converted defense factories. He said that defense production 
proper accounted for as little as 20 percent of the defense 
industry's output and there were no customers for the remaining 
80 percent. "For this reason aircraft, ships, locomotives so 
needed by the railroad ministry and tank-trucks are 
stockpiling," he emphasized.

  [Text] Training flights have been considerably reduced at 
several air-defense units in the Far East, because of a shortage 
of fuel. The air-defense army headquarters told Interfax that 
unless fuel supplies are sorted out, fighter-interceptors will 
soon only be able to take off on an occasional basis and 
training plans will have to be cancelled altogether.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General S.I. Syedin, professor and </F>
doctor of psychology, by unidentified correspondent; date and 
place not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Sergey Ivanovich, you have devoted 
your entire life to the armed forces, in particular to military 
psychology. In recent years you headed the military psychology 
faculty at the Humanitarian Academy of the Armed Forces. What 
prospects do you see for military psychology in particular, and 
the use of psychology in the armed forces in general, while 
major reforms are being carried out in the army? 
  [Syedin] You cannot include military psychology among those 
sciences that make up the armed forces' methodological basis of 
construction. At the same time, we note that the armed forces 
cannot be built without military psychology. The historical 
experience of the Russian Army's development prior to 1917 
indicates great attention was always paid to the mental state of 
servicemen. There was even a society of devotees of military 
affairs which published a magazine centered mainly on military 
psychology. 
  Presently, every unit has a psychologist, as do formations 
and groups. However, in my opinion the problem of creating a 
social and psychological service, and of the psychological 
system as a whole, has not been completely solved. 
  [Correspondent] Do the people who have been appointed as 
unit and formation psychologists fulfill the requirements in 
terms of their professional training? What is your opinion? 
  [Syedin] In answering this question and discussing this 
issue, I would like to relate what the purely official 
understanding of a psychologist is. In my opinion, a military 
psychologist is an officer who occupies the position and who has 
a state-approved diploma as a psychologist. As it turns out, 
presently the positions of psychologists are occupied by people 
who do not fully meet these requirements. 
  Personally, I have always supported the idea that any job 
should be done by a professional. The professional should know 
the results of his actions and work, and should predict its 
outcome. Much is presently being said and written about 
psychotropic weapons and making zombies out of people 
[zombirovaniye]. But these are still unresearched 
manifestations. I do not want to dispute it, but at the same 
time I would not like to see those who are professionally 
untrained dabbling in it. 
  [Correspondent] Presently, a large number of young men, 
former servicemen or active duty servicemen who have experienced 
extreme situations or participated in combat, have accumulated 
in our armed forces and state in general. Could military 
psychologists organize some form of assistance, some form of 
psychotherapeutic rehabilitation, for them? Can something be 
done for them along these lines today? 
  [Syedin] Our department has studied the experience of 
psychological rehabilitation abroad. The U.S. armed forces have 
a wealth of experience in this area. We know about the problems 
of Vietnam war veterans, and that there are 196 centers in the 
United States for the psychological rehabilitation of war 
veterans and their families. 
  In our armed forces, and in associated public services such 
as various committees for the social defense of servicemen and 
members of their families, this kind of purpose-oriented work is 
not carried out. At the same time, practical work by the staff 
and teachers of our department shows that to a great extent 
military psychology, particularly the psychology of a 
humanitarian, is capable of doing achieving this.

  [Excerpts] [Video shows Zhirinovskiy at news conference] 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I am starting to go sour. I need an enemy, 
somebody to fight with. The Communists and the Democratic 
Russians are lying down -- who can I fight with? I cannot kick 
a man when he is down, understand? There is nobody to fight. 
  [Correspondent] That is how the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia] leader assessed the political power of his 
party today. [passage omitted] The first task of the LDPR now is 
the struggle for the rights of Russians in the former Soviet 
Union, and, says Zhirinovskiy, this struggle will be merciless. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will use all the most effective means to 
defend our population, so that they will always [words 
indistinct] to touch citizens of the Russian state, always. 
There will only be a scorched desert left. There will be 
nothing left. 
  [Correspondent] Apart from that, the leader of the LDPR once 
more made a firm prediction for the geopolitical future of the 
former republics of the Soviet Baltic. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] You will get a governor general of the Baltic 
guberniya, a Russian, in the capital, in Riga, you will get a 
small town of Tallinn choking without light or heat, where 
Estonians will catch fish and eat them cold because there will 
be no electricity, and the town of Kaunas, the capital of the 
little Lithuanian state. You will definitely get that. A weak 
little national banner will flap in the wind over those two 
territories, Kaunas and Tallinn. [passage omitted]

given by LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in the State Duma on 
29 March; from the "Vesti" newscast; Zhirinovskiy remarks 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Video shows Zhirinovskiy holding news conference] 
[Dubnov] In the State Duma building today a news conference by 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader took place 
which was devoted to the 5th Congress of the Liberal Democrats 
opening on 2 April. After declaring categorically that this 
would be the congress of the party whose line was no less than 
the whole of our people had chosen, Mr. Zhirinovskiy went on to 
boast about the two main victories of his party. The first was 
the amnesty: 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We were the main instrument for passing the 
amnesty. The political amnesty in the first place. The 
initiative for a criminal amnesty did not come from us. 
  [Dubnov, over Zhirinovskiy's voice] There is now someone we 
can thank for the greatest event in the history of the Russian 
parliament of the end of the 20th century, as Vladimir Volfovich 
put it. Although we will note that any criminal can now claim 
that he committed a crime at that moment for political reasons 
-- both the sniper who fired into the crowd and the marauder who 
robbed a savings bank. The second mighty victory of the LDPR 
lies in the fact that, in the words of its leader, the party has 
averted war in Serbia by announcing to those countries whose 
pilots were getting ready to bomb Serbian troops that return 
bomb strikes would be carried out against their capitals. 
Getting more and more worked up, Mr. Zhirinovskiy once again 
confirmed his readiness to defend the rights of Russians in the 
Near Abroad using highly unambiguous methods. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] We will respond with such a terrible blow 
that 
these peoples will forget what civilization means. There will 
be a scorched desert there. 
  [Dubnov] We can now put a question to the law enforcement 
agencies -- does this outburst come under the article on appeals 
to war and arousing interethnic strife?

Council: Law on Elections Needed"] 
  [Text] Draw up a draft law on elections to regional 
representative organs of power and local self-government of the 
Russian Federation, the State Duma Council has issued that 
instruction to a number of parliamentary committees. 
  The decision was prompted by a letter to the chamber from 
the 
coordinating council of the "Democratic Russia" movement, citing 
numerous instances of violation of the Constitution and flouting 
of citizens' electoral rights in the course of the preparation 
and holding of the present elections in Russia's regions. 
  The opinion of the members of the chamber's council was 
unanimous: This "election sickness" can only be cured on the 
basis of a reliable legal foundation, which does not at present 
exist.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Karkhanin: "Federation Council Urges </F>
Peace on Ossetians and Ingushetians"] 
  [Text] The Federation Council will continue to examine the 
situation obtaining in the state of emergency zone in North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia. This was reported by Vladimir Shumeyko, 
the chamber's chairman. According to him, "the question of the 
conflict between the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia 
is very acute in nature and violates that supreme human right -- 
the right to life." 
  Deputies instructed the Federation Council chairman to set 
up 
a special commission under the leadership of Ramazan Abdulatipov 
for further study and consideration of this issue. After this 
has been done, the commission is to submit its own proposals to 
the president. Deputies intend to hold an enlarged session of 
the Security Council with the special commission's participation 
in order to make a final decision at the chamber's next session. 
  Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that many decisions had been made 
before but none of them had been carried out. Therefore, he 
stressed, it is "essential that all three branches of power -- 
the Federation Council, the president, and the government -- 
discuss this question and make a common decision." 
  The deputies present at the closed session adopted an appeal 
to the peoples of Ingushetia and North Ossetia. The document 
stresses the need for them to "lay down their arms and solve the 
problems built up over many years by peaceful means." 
  Thus, three days of debate in the upper chamber of 
parliament 
on how to settle the conflict have essentially failed to yield a 
constructive result. It has become clear to the participants in 
the session of the upper chamber of parliament that to think 
that the explosive situation in the North Caucasus will 
stabilize of its own accord would be like trying to fall asleep 
on a powder keg.

<F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin by Nikolay </F>
Rafayenko and Oleg Rubnikovich; place and date not given: "Ivan 
Rybkin: `I Do Not Want To Be the Special Services' Advocate.' 
However, They Should Not Be Reformed Indefinitely Either, the 
State Duma Chairman Thinks"] 
  [Excerpts] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each country has its own 
national security concept on the basis of which it organizes the 
activity of its special services. Given that the Russian state 
security agencies are being reformed for the sixth time in the 
past two years, can one say that our national security concept 
has changed six times? 
  [Rybkin] As for Russia, we do have a concept. Reform is 
under way in the special services. Sometimes it is very 
painful, unfortunately. They say correctly that there is 
nothing more wasteful than reorganization. Special service 
staffers are probably realizing that. This sphere is very 
sensitive, so there is no need to go into particular detail 
regarding this subject. Russia must be securely covered from 
this flank regardless of political changes. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Each year our country is rocked by 
conflicts between the branches of power. Not long ago, the mass 
media carried reports about yet another coup allegedly designed 
to remove President Boris Yeltsin from power. There have been 
reports that this "version" was advantageous for some people in 
the government. What can you say in that respect? 
  [Rybkin] What I have is information required for my work as 
chairman of the State Duma. My main work today is the budget. 
The country is living without a budget for 1994. That won't do 
at all. 
  As for emergency scenarios. I think all of us have enough 
powers to act within the framework of the law, and effectively 
so, even in conditions of an all-encompassing crisis suffered by 
the economy. But this is possible only when there is civil peace 
in society. We must not let what happened on 4 October 1993 
recur; 4 October was our common defeat. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] How realistic is the recurrence of 
that situation? 
  [Rybkin] I think that given the collaboration between the 
authorities that has currently been emerging, its chances are 
nil. If, of course, the collaboration holds out. The president, 
the chairman of the government, the chairmen of the State Duma 
and the Federation Council, leaders of all prominent parties 
that have been chosen by the voters, representatives of various 
confessions and trade union leaders will sign an agreement on 
civil peace. This is a condition for our moving ahead, for our 
reform. [passage omitted] 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Let us recall the not so distant past. 
Formidable KGB units were operating against a handful of 
dissidents; now, when attempts to shake the Constitution loose 
are being made all the time, this area of the special services' 
work is being scaled down. Maybe it would make sense to give 
the functions of protecting the Constitution back to the special 
services? 
  [Rybkin] I would probably agree with you. Even what we have 
does not work. The Constitutional Court at least operated in a 
normal fashion... 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So what is to be done? The 
Constitutional Court is no longer in operation; the militia 
combats terrorism, it has no time for other things. Who is 
protecting us then? 
  [Rybkin] I do not want to be the special services' or the 
militia's advocate. The protection of the constitutional order 
is a multifaceted process, it must come to the attention of both 
the special services and the Constitutional Court. Now we are 
ready to pass the law on the Constitutional Court. It has 
already been drawn up. All tensions between the Main Legal 
Administration and the Constitutional Court have been 
eliminated. The next meeting will consider these matters. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] You claim that the tensions have been 
eliminated. This is a questionable statement. At a recent 
press conference, Nikolay Vitruk, Constitutional Court member, 
had complaints to make against the Main Legal Administration, 
the Main Security Administration, and the Federal Agency of 
Government Communications and Information. For instance, he 
said that Mikhail Barsukov (Main Security Administration chief 
-- editorial board) allegedly tapped all his telephones and that 
no one could do anything about it. 
  [Rybkin] I approach this matter rather philosophically. 
When I dealt with the economy, a man was sitting above my 
office who was in charge of my communications, and he was 
probably able to listen to my telephone conversations at any 
moment. At present, this also accompanies me. He who installs 
telephones can tap them, too. It is another matter that this 
should be done in accordance with the law. I cannot bring such 
charges against Barsukov, Ivanov, or Petrov. If someone is 
tapping somebody, he must be doing so if state interests are at 
stake, but such actions should be regulated by law. He who does 
so without legitimate reasons is a criminal. But until I can 
prove that he is a criminal, I do not have the right to accuse 
him. [passage omitted] 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] As of today we have effectively no 
special services. They have been "victimized." Professionals 
have been abandoning them for commercial businesses. The only 
real effective law-enforcement agency we have been left with is 
the Internal Affairs Ministry. Do you agree? 
  [Rybkin] No, I do not. My view is not so pessimistic. It 
is very regrettable that some professionals in the prime of 
their career have found themselves out on the street. But you 
should agree that the special services cannot be stretched 
indefinitely. Presently we are parting with the past, the 
differentiation of people is under way -- this is, naturally, 
painful -- but necessary. 
  The sphere of the special services' activity is very 
sensitive. The intelligence services of Great Britain, the 
United States, France, Israel, and other countries are operating 
both against us and against each other. But at the same time 
they cooperate. We should forge a partnership, but carefully 
so. I have Yevgeniy Primakov's (Foreign Intelligence Service 
director -- editorial board) proposal sitting on my desk saying 
that we should keep as much as to make our relations 
"transparent," so that we will trust each other. What is 
redundant may be cut. [passage omitted] 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But it is our own authorities that are 
beginning to slice and cut the special services, trying to fit 
them into some models; as a result the new does not emerge, but 
the old stops working... 
  [Rybkin] This is not an easy time. Everything is undergoing 
reform, but reforms should be carried out so as to make them 
less painful. People ought to find application for their 
knowledge and talents. 
  [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Or, maybe, reform in the structures of 
authorities should be temporarily suspended until we get back on 
our feet economically? 
  [Rybkin] I think we should take into account the so-called 
Parkinson's Law. The country has shrunk to one-half its former 
size. But the number of bureaucrats has doubled. How should we 
combat this trend? There are plenty of prescriptions: both 
American experience and the experience of other countries. In 
Russia, however, drawing on foreign experience is often 
counterproductive. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kiev -- A news conference on the results of the 
elections of people's deputies to the Supreme Council of Ukraine 
was held on 29 March. Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central 
Electoral Commission, confirmed that the elections had taken 
place in all 450 constituencies. Forty-nine deputies were 
elected in the first round, of whom 11 are engineers, 13 
education workers, three lawyers and economists. With regard to 
party affiliation, the deputies have been divided in the 
following manner: 12 are members of the Communist Party of 
Ukraine; four are Rukh members; two each from the Ukrainian 
Republican Party, Peasants Party of Ukraine, [SelPU] Congress of 
Ukrainian Nationalists [KUN] and the Socialist Party of Ukraine; 
one from the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party -- party 
leader Stepan Khmara, and 24 have no party affiliation. 
  In the words of Ivan Yemets, the overwhelming majority of 
parties are maintaining their positions in the second round. In 
the first instance this concerns the communists, socialists and 
the national-democrats. Ivan Yemets expressed confidence that 
the "second round would give Ukraine a new parliament." 
Replying to a question about how many deputies would be 
required in order for the new parliament to start working, Ivan 
Yemets said: "There are some discrepancies with the current 
legislation in relation to this question, therefore it will be 
ascertained later how many deputies, 226 or 301, will be 
required". 
  Speaking about the poll in Crimea, Ivan Yemets said that the 
Central Electoral Commission had nothing whatsoever to do with 
this process. It was a matter purely for the president of 
Crimea. It was reported that the majority of district electoral 
commissions had scheduled the second round of elections for 10 
April. On this matter, Ivan Yemets called on representatives of 
the press to make every effort to explain to the population the 
necessity of electing a new parliament.

  [Text] The complexity of the elections for the Crimean 
Supreme Soviet which took place on Sunday [27 March] 
considerably slowed down the vote-counting process. [Word 
indistinct] results of the election will probably not be made 
public until Wednesday, the general outcome is known. Our 
correspondent reported that (?so far) 12 deputies to the Crimean 
parliament were elected in single-seat districts. The Russia 
bloc, supported by 77 percent of the electorate, became the 
unquestioned leader in multiseat districts, where the elections 
were based on party preference. (?Most of) the 14 legislative 
seats earmarked for parties were won by this bloc. The 
Communists can count on only one or two seats in the Crimean 
parliament; as little as 11 percent of the electorate voted for 
them. In the Crimean Tatar national electoral districts, most 
of the seats were garnered by candidates proposed by the 
kurultay [congress of all Tatars], who won the support of 89 
percent of the constituency. Representatives of the displaced 
Crimean people are allocated 14 out of a total 98 seats in the 
Crimean Supreme Soviet.

declared null and void would be set after the second round of 
the elections. 
  Commenting on the Crimean election results, Leonid Grach, 
Communist Party of Crimea first secretary, said: "The elections 
have demonstrated that a certain part of Crimea's population 
does support Communists. Of course, we did not expect a total 
victory. As a result we have a patriotic leftist parliament, 
and the main task of Crimean parliamentarians is to search for a 
formula of unity." 
  Asked by an UNIAN correspondent about possible cooperation 
with representatives of the Kurultay of the Crimean Tartar 
People in parliament, Leonid Grach said: "We are ready to 
cooperate with everybody for the sake of Crimea's future."

  [Text] Donetsk -- A news conference by Petro Symonenko, 
first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of Ukraine [CPU], and Heorhiy Buyko and Volodymyr Kocherha 
[names as transliterated], secretaries of the CPU Donetsk Oblast 
committee, took place on 29 March. It was devoted to the 
results of the first stage of voting in elections to Ukraine's 
Supreme Council. Petro Symonenko stated that in Ukraine "great 
interest in the leftist forces is noticeable right now. The 
stance of our candidates made an impression on our voters." 
Petro Symonenko is certain that the Communists will come out as 
victors in the second round of voting too. 
  Answering the question of a UNIAN correspondent about how 
the 
CPU is planning to deal with party property that has not been 
returned to them, the party secretary replied: "Commercial 
structures have been given 60 percent of party property. 
Primarily, we would like to ask on what grounds the property 
was handed over to them and not to the ownership of the people. 
If these structures are speculative ones, then let them return 
the property, which belongs to the party, and then the party 
will decide where to direct the funds." 
  Petro Symonenko reported that should the Communists obtain a 
party majority in the Supreme Council, they will be raising the 
issue of calling off presidential elections in Ukraine. As far 
as work in the new Supreme Council is concerned, the secretary 
of the CPU Central Committee stated: "We need to find a 
compromise with the opposing forces that will be in the future 
Supreme Council so as not to conduct a political struggle over a 
certain period of time. In the first place we need to resolve 
the economic problems, and only then the political ones."

  [Text] Commenting on the results of the Crimean elections 
and the opinion poll, Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of 
the Crimean Government, told POSTFACTUM that the question of 
treaty-based relations between Crimea and Kiev would only ease 
tension, but by no means lead to the breakdown of Ukraine. In 
his words, both the elections and the poll actually recorded the 
existing situation. The deputy prime minister also stressed that 
Crimea had no intention of breaking away from Ukraine if a 
sensible economic policy is implemented and if the work of the 
Crimean leadership is not disrupted. However, it was clear that 
this was unrealistic in the near future, Saburov said. 
  Therefore, Crimea is going to raise the question of special 
relations, first and foremost in the economic sphere, and it 
will go as far as concluding international treaties.

  [Text] The situation in Crimea will deteriorate further. 
Yuriy Meshkov and his administration and the newly-elected 
Supreme Council will not be able to work constructively at 
maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula, says a 
statement by the Ukrainian sociopolitical organizations of 
Crimea and the Crimean Tatar National Rukh. This document is 
devoted to the outcome of the elections of 27 March in Ukraine. 
  The organization of the Crimean Tatar National Rukh will 
support the Ukrainian organizations in questions of maintenance 
of territorial integrity and affirmation of Ukrainian power on 
the territory of Crimea, the statement says. The authors of the 
document cite cases of a crude breach of legislation on the 
peninsula in the course of the election campaign and the 
elections themselves, but the greatest breach noted in the 
statement was the canvassing speech by the president on the eve 
of the elections on local TV.

  [Text] Donetsk 30 Mar, TASS -- Contrary to numerous 
forecasts, Ukrainian parliamentary elections on 27 March turned 
out to be valid, with an almost 75 percent turnout of voters. 
  More than 25 million people went to the polls, with the 
highest voter turnout recorded in Lvov, Ternopol, 
Ivano-Frankovsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Poltava, Khmelnitsky and 
Kharkov regions. The turnout of voters in the Republic of 
Crimea was 71 per cent. In Kiev, slightly more than a half of 
the electorate cast their votes. 
  Only 49 out of the prospective 450-member parliament were 
elected in the first round of polling (25 had been nominated by 
parties and 24 are nonparty people). 
  Run-offs are to be held in 401 districts before 10 April. 
However, Central Electoral Commission Chief Ivan Yemets believes 
that in the majority of districts run-offs may be held this 
coming weekend, with only two candidates in each district to 
contest seats in parliament.

<F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kravchuk by N. Gavrileva, in Kiev and </F>
Simferopol; date not given: "I See Three Moves Ahead...."] 
  [Text] Kiev-Simferopol -- The president of Ukraine has not 
paid an official visit to the Republic of Crimea for quite some 
time, and it is not often that Crimean journalists are in Kiev, 
and it is even less often that they are received by the top 
leader of the state. Half an hour had been allotted for the 
interview with KRYMSKIYE IZVESTIYA, and not a minute more, but 
the conversation with the president lasted 45 minutes and was 
broken off on account of his tight schedule. We regard this as a 
sign of the Ukrainian leadership's special attention to Crimean 
problems. 
  [Gavrileva] Several years ago Ukraine opted for the path of 
the building of its own statehood based on the national idea. 
But nationalism has always led either to war or to 
destitution--there is no other way. Ukraine has managed to take 
the less painful second path. But it is time to extricate 
ourselves from the destitution also.... 
  [Kravchuk] It is an illusion that things are going badly for 
Ukraine because it is pursuing some national policy: Things are 
going badly for everyone, and this is natural; I would like this 
understood. There has been no instance in history of the 
collapse of one system and the building of another occurring 
simultaneously with an increase in production and economic 
prosperity. 
  It is not a question of Kravchuk's national policy here, but 
of the difficulty of this transition. I put down to our 
credit--not that of myself, but of all of us--the fact that with 
such difficulties, such a structure, and such a character of our 
state, we are tackling all questions in peace. We must all 
extricate ourselves from the destitution, this including Russia, 
which is the point of yearning for Crimea, where the illusion 
has been created that, should it become a part of Russia, things 
would immediately be easier for everyone. 
  But we watch Ostankino (even if doctored): Production there 
is coming to a halt, wages have not been paid for three months, 
and in the heartland there is simply nothing other than 
potatoes--what, then, is the issue? Russia is a most wealthy 
state selling timber, oil, and gas, and we purchase these! So 
the judgments and the speculation on this basis should not be so 
superficial. 
  I understand Crimea's gravitation toward Russia, but it is 
not all of Crimea that aspires to this, which the voting showed, 
incidentally. Some 1.8 million Russians--it was they, by and 
large, who voted for such a policy. But others also live in 
Crimea: 600,000 Ukrainians, 250,000 Crimean Tatars; God willing, 
this will come to nearly 1 million. Crimea cannot be perceived 
as uniform and as supporting only the policy that has been 
proposed by its present leadership. 
  Russia has its interests in Crimea, and it will not renounce 
them, but let us see how to adjust and mate these interests. If 
some politicians from Crimea believe that it is possible to 
cross over to Russia immediately by having learned the opinion 
of part of the population, this is a profound delusion. This is 
a subject for discussion by the whole Ukrainian people: When a 
divorce is under way, it is not only the wishes of one party in 
a family that are taken into consideration. Somebody holding 
someone back is not the issue here. Go ahead! The husband, if he 
is noble, leaves the refrigerator, the bed, the land, the house, 
and walks away. We do not object. 
  What kind of policy is Russia pursuing today? We in the 
upper echelons of power, they say, will not interfere but will 
with the middle strata (the deputies and such) inflame the 
situation, and then Crimea will itself by the revolutionary 
path, creating tension within, gradually, given certain 
political circumstances, come over to Russia. 
  Ukraine's strategy: We say that we will not consent to any 
negotiations concerning borders, territorial integrity, or 
sovereignty. And the world is backing us at this time--I say 
this without exaggeration. The UN Security Council's response to 
Russia's Sevastopol decision is a clear example of this. In 
addition, Yeltsin and I signed the corresponding agreement. The 
Europeans do not understand what is happening here. Surely we 
understand that it is impossible today to carve up borders--the 
holy of holies, the pillars of European security! This is why we 
say: It cannot be done! 
  But considering the special status, history, and population 
of Crimea, we agree to grant it economic independence just as 
far as this is possible--but with the political status quo! 
These are not just words. Yu. Meshkov was sitting next to me, 
and we reached an agreement: The budget--let us do as you wish, 
let us balance its revenue and expenditure sides. Everything 
will now depend on actual work. If Crimea takes care of its 
revenue side itself, it will look after all its expenditures; 
we, on the other hand, will help the Crimean Tatar population.... 
  [Gavrileva] In what way? 
  [Kravchuk] We will allocate additional money from the 
Ukrainian budget. You will have complete economic freedom, 
complete independence. 
  [Gavrileva] We have a new deputy prime minister.... What is 
being decided, incidentally, on the question of his citizenship? 
  [Kravchuk] It will be resolved, this is not a problem.... 
  [Gavrileva] What do you think, what that is new will Ye. 
Saburov bring to the development of Crimea's economy and the 
relations of Kiev and Simferopol? 
  [Kravchuk] From what I have heard and read, I understand 
that 
he is a rational person capable of seeing the goal. He is 
capable of a great deal and probably understands that he can do 
nothing without Ukraine. 
  One simple thing needs to be understood: There is in the 
world one state--Ukraine--and no one knows of such a state as 
Crimea. Neither the president nor the prime minister of any 
European state will ever meet either with Meshkov or with 
Saburov. If problems are to be resolved with the aid of the 
attraction of foreign capital (and they will not otherwise be 
resolved today), this can be done only via Ukraine, of which 
Crimea is a part, and we are prepared for this, and I will do 
everything to ensure that this be done. 
  But on one condition: Let us get down to business. If there 
are to be referenda, slogans--to whom does Crimea belong--it 
will be difficult for us. I do not wish to discuss political 
questions in respect to Crimea today, therefore, I wish to 
discuss only economic matters--and here I will even go above and 
beyond the limit. 
  [Gavrileva] The following question is appropriate here: What 
is your attitude toward a possible ruble zone in Crimea? 
  [Kravchuk] Only a person who (excuse me, I do not wish to 
give offense) who has not on these matters made a thorough study 
of everything or who has been misinformed could talk about this. 
There cannot be two currency zones in one state. Note the 
independent state of Belarus (and the leadership of Crimea 
favors Crimea as an independent state--this is, I believe, the 
main goal? Drift toward Russia is the second stage). 
  I am an economist by education, and for this reason I say 
that unless it has its own currency, no state can exist 
independently, this is precluded. Belarus is moving into the 
ruble zone, but Russia has set the condition of conversion of 
the Belorusian bank into a branch of the Russian bank, and we 
know under whose jurisdiction a branch comes! So why deceive the 
Crimeans? 
  Very well, let us assume that there is to be the ruble in 
Crimea. But who will supply it? Russia? The ruble is a material 
value. How many rubles would Crimea need, add it up? Would 
Russia supply them? 
  Very well, let us assume even this: Crimea has the ruble. 
But 
it is an open border, and the ruble is of greater value than the 
karbovanets, and tomorrow these rubles would be in Kherson and 
Nikolayev and would reach Kiev--in any event, they would be 
laundered from Crimea like lightning. And would Russia agree to 
Ukraine pumping rubles via Crimea? Would Ukraine here want to 
convert its state bank into a branch of the Russian bank and to 
have all political and economic problems decided in Moscow, not 
in Kiev and Simferopol? 
  People are unaware of these details. It is said that people 
would come on vacation here and spend rubles. But would there be 
that many of these rubles? People would immediately come to 
Crimea from all the adjacent oblasts and sell the vacationers 
products that are not available in Crimea and would take away 
these rubles, and Crimea would get nothing. These are elementary 
axioms. How much is a health center pass? 
  [Gavrileva] A lot. Millions. 
  [Kravchuk] And who would come? Working people? Crimea would 
become a Mecca for the rich. And what kind of price list would 
there be in the stores, what kind of exchange rate? This is all 
based on childish naivete. 
  [Gavrileva] Leonid Makarovich, do you have a strategy for 
the 
development of the economy in Ukraine? The title "open economy 
regime" has at least crystallized out in Crimea (it is not 
entirely clear what this means, it is true), but Ukraine does 
not have even this.... 
  [Kravchuk] Stop at the stores on Kreshchatik, look at the 
choice of items. A year ago, when Mr. Kuchma was in charge, so 
to speak, the stores were absolutely bare. Now they are full--no 
money. 
  [Gavrileva] This is abnormal also! 
  [Kravchuk] But this is easier: If there is no money, it has 
to be earned. 
  [Gavrileva] Excuse me, but we would not get very far: The 
journalist here and the journalist in the United States receive 
totally different pay for their work.... 
  [Kravchuk] I would respond that 80 percent of the newspapers 
in the United States are private. It is the founder who should 
pay the wages you deserve. 
  [Gavrileva] All right, score one to you. Nonetheless, is 
there a strategy for development of the Ukrainian economy? 
  [Kravchuk] There is only one path--the path of reforms. 
  [Gavrileva] What is needed for their implementation? 
  [Kravchuk] Work to be done locally. I was talking just 
yesterday with five oblasts: Why is privatization with you not 
progressing? They replied: We are thinking, we are 
considering.... You understand, if I (the state) can supply an 
enterprise with raw material and wages, I keep it. If I cannot, 
I let it go. Who today in Crimea, for example, is impeding 
privatization? Myself? 
  [Gavrileva] We are speaking of the local authorities, hence, 
it is time to speak about the local councils.... 
  [Kravchuk] ....and the representatives of the president. 
  [Gavrileva] This institution will be abolished in Ukraine 
following the elections, incidentally, and the Supreme Council 
of Ukraine has begun to speak once again of its introduction in 
Crimea.... 
  [Kravchuk] It is not a question of a representative of the 
president, but of representation of Ukraine in Crimea. This is 
what the law says! Crimea has its representation in Kiev--and we 
should have ours in Crimea, and this is all being cranked up 
specially. 
  [Gavrileva] And N. Bagrov had to explain the situation even 
in this connection in our newspaper.... And how did you 
personally evaluate the decision of the Supreme Council of 
Crimea on the undesirability of elections to the local councils 
in the summer? 
Perhaps Crimea has shown all of Ukraine the right way? 
  [Moroz] Are you satisfied with your "team"? How do you 
select your people? 
  [Meshkov] According to the principle of professionalism and 
ability to function in an extreme environment. 
  [Moroz] But does not your enlistment of Saburov, an 
individual "from outside," someone from another country no 
less--does this not imply that you are experiencing a severe 
personnel shortage? 
  [Meshkov] No, it does not. Saburov is not "from outside." 
He is 100 percent Crimean, born in Yalta. But I am not even 
referring to that. I am not talking about the space defined by 
the borders of Crimea, but rather the space defined by the 
borders of Russia. We do not perceive borders as a norm or as a 
natural condition. Everything not in conformance with objective 
economic laws, everything that contradicts common sense--is 
nonviable. On the contrary, we could follow Hegel: Everything 
rational is real. Everything is standardized and fit into a 
norm. As far as a shortage of personnel is concerned, the 
Ukrainian Government might well wish it could boast of 
specialists in the class, on the level and with the 
qualifications of Mr. Saburov. 
  [Moroz] Some people see a certain external resemblance 
between the two of you... 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) In any case, it was not based on any 
resemblance to me that I invited him to assume the post of 
deputy prime minister. That is a fact. 
  [Moroz] What are the main tasks you have set for him? 
  [Meshkov] To do everything that can be done at this time and 
in this place to improve the economic situation. 
  [Moroz] How do you assess this situation? 
  [Meshkov] It is a catastrophe. A catastrophe colored yellow 
and blue. 
  [Moroz] (A small illustration of the president's words with 
respect to the catastrophic situation in the economy. A 
cleaning lady in a Simferopol hotel, at which a "CIS-er" 
[Commonwealth of Independent States] is fleeced to the tune of 
R40,000 per day for an average room, receives less than R9,000 a 
month. A civil aviation pilot who retires gets R18,000 in 
pension. The Crimean president himself, I was told by one of 
his aides, receives a salary of 1,900,000 karbovantsy. Despite 
the large number of zeros, this comes to just R82,610 as of the 
moment of my departure from Crimea last Saturday. Today it is 
reduced still more, since the coupon/ruble rate keeps falling 
and falling...--O.M.) You have stated that you intend to return 
Crimea to the ruble zone. 
  [Meshkov] I intend to. For us the ruble is a more 
acceptable means of payment, since our main flow of 
tourists--people who spend money in Crimea--are citizens of 
Russia. To provide them normal services, if you will, is one of 
the most important tasks of our oblast economy, and we will 
accomplish this task. 
  [Moroz] But there is no border between Crimea and Ukraine. 
It would be practically impossible to introduce a currency here 
different from that used in Ukraine... 
  [Meshkov] What is going on right now is impossible. Our 
reality of today is impossible. We are striving to return to a 
normal condition. 
  [Moroz] The way I understand it, to do this you would have 
to violate the laws of Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] The laws of Ukraine constitute one of the factors 
leading to the current economic situation. The results are 
before you, as they say. 
  [Moroz] What do you see as the primary cause of the 
catastrophic situation that has arisen in Ukraine and rushed 
towards you in a wave? 
  [Meshkov] The situation is even more desperate than you 
think. But the primary cause is encroachment, the way they 
perceive it, upon the sense of national dignity of some 
nationalists of Western Ukraine, which has led to a general 
economic collapse of the gigantic European state Ukraine 
comprises. This is the price that was paid for the realization 
of nationalist slogans. And it was effected with the full 
composure, indifference, and silent encouragement of Europe and 
the United States. The United States became alarmed only when 
the nationalists put their finger on the nuclear button. While 
it was clear from the very beginning that this would happen, but 
now they are saying a Russian nationalist has come to power in 
Crimea. From where does such delusion come? The dignified 
magazine ECONOMIST (Paris) publishes an article entitled "The 
Second Crimean War." 
  [Moroz] A month and a half has elapsed now since you were 
elected president. What has this time brought you as leader of 
the Republic of Crimea? Have there been any unexpected 
revelations? 
  [Meshkov] Yes. First of all, the attitude of previous state 
officials; this is open sabotage. It is nothing obscure or 
secretive, but rather open and defiant. 
  [Moroz] You were hoping for something different? 
  [Meshkov] No, I was not hoping for their assistance, but 
neither did I expect defiance. I did not expect that it would 
be so aggressive, clearly antipeople, irrational... and 
criminal, in the final analysis. That is one thing I did not 
expect. A second thing was the revelation as to what extent our 
law enforcement organs are infected with the disease called 
corruption. 
  [Moroz] Incidentally, you were forced to leave your position 
as procuracy investigator for attempting to bring charges 
against members of the party and administration nomenklatura 
caught in embezzlement. Do you still have this motivating drive 
to fight for justice? 
  [Meshkov] I still have the drive, and my capacities have 
grown immeasurably. 
  [Moroz] How do you intend to fight crime? Do you have a 
specific, precisely defined program? 
  [Meshkov] Implementation of the program to fight crime 
runs headlong into a personnel problem, unfortunately. There 
are insufficient personnel capable of carrying on this fight. 
  [Moroz] During your time in office have you managed to 
establish any personal contacts with the leaders of Ukraine and 
Russia? 
  [Meshkov] With the leaders of Ukraine--no. Only on the 
official level. The situation with respect to Russia is 
directly the reverse. 
  [Moroz] What do you consider yourself--a Russian or a 
Ukrainian (your father being Russian and your mother Ukrainian)? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) I consider myself a Don Cossack. 
  [Moroz] Do you know Ukrainian? 
  [Meshkov] Yes, I understand it. 
  [Moroz] Do you read with a dictionary? 
  [Meshkov] No, I do not need a dictionary. My reading is 
fluent. But my speaking... I am not about to assert that I 
speak correct literary language. I speak on the everyday, 
colloquial level. 
  [Moroz] What place in your plans of presidential activity is 
occupied by facilitating resolution of the Black Sea Fleet 
problem? We know that Russia and Ukraine are resolving it. They 
are trying to resolve it. However, except for the seamen 
themselves, it is Crimeans who suffer more than anyone else from 
a failure to resolve this issue. 
  [Meshkov] This problem is essentially resolved. The only 
question is to what extent conditions of the agreement will be 
conscientiously observed. A readiness to do so is manifest on 
Russia's part, as far as I am aware. This is not true with 
respect to Ukraine. The Black Sea Fleet is a Russian fleet. 
This is natural. It is economically feasible. All the rest 
will depend on the rational or irrational actions of the other 
side. For us, the presence of the Black Sea Fleet is a benefit 
of which it would be a sin not to take advantage. 
  [Moroz] How is your intention to take Ukrainian armed 
formations out of Crimea being executed? 
  [Meshkov] I requested the Ukrainian leadership to remove 
first of all those troops that were introduced in violation of 
agreement and the existing order (troops may be introduced only 
with the consent of the Supreme Council of Crimea). The 
presence of these forces does not contribute toward 
normalization of relations between Crimea and Ukraine. In 
addition, they are occupying a fairly large amount of territory 
which could be used for economic purposes. Finally, they 
represent a certain threat to the ecology. 
  [Moroz] What is the numerical strength of these troops? 
  [Meshkov] They are fairly large units, unfortunately. 
  [Moroz] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported about 60,000. 
  [Meshkov] KRASNAYA ZVEZDA rarely errs in these matters. 
They have reliable sources. 
  [Moroz] It is apparent that Crimean Tatars followed the 
appeals of their leaders and voted against you. Many of them do 
not recognize you as president. Do you hope to be able to 
shatter their negative attitude toward you? 
  [Meshkov] It is incorrect to assert that the Crimean Tatars 
do not recognize the president. It would be more accurate to 
state that the leadership of one wing of the national movement 
of Crimean Tatars entered into alliance with my political 
opponent and supported him, and when he lost, they declared they 
did not agree with the one who won. This is not politics. This 
is not on the political level. It is on the mundane level. It 
is simply undignified to resolve political problems on the 
mundane level. As far as support from ordinary citizens of the 
Republic of Crimea is concerned, a million or more of their 
votes is more than sufficient to be able to calmly sit down in 
this chair. And among that million are a great many citizens of 
Crimean Tatar nationality. 
  [Moroz] Do you intend to repeal the quota of 14 seats for 
Crimean Tatars in the parliament, as you promised? 
  [Meshkov] I did not say I intended to repeal the quota. I 
said that I do not accept the principle of endowment of 
political rights according to nationality. I opposed this as a 
deputy and as candidate for president. And I now oppose it as 
president. It is a flagrant violation of international law and 
universal standards, but I have no intention of repealing what 
has already come about. 
  [Moroz] Do you sense any action on the part of the special 
services? Are they watching you? 
  [Meshkov] (Laughing) Well, beginning from a certain time 
and at a certain level of political and state activity, this is 
inevitable. 
  [Moroz] How do you evaluate Khrushchev's unforgettable 
decision to transfer Crimea to Ukraine? 
  [Meshkov] One in a series of delirious inventions and 
decisions. It has nothing to do with common sense or with man's 
treatment of his fellow man. But from the legal and judicial 
point of view, the issue is decided. The acts of 1954 were 
declared invalid as of the moment of their adoption. Thus, 
everything is normal in this aspect. The only thing that 
remains is to return to common sense and universal concepts.

  [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk held talks in Kiev today 
with Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov. After the 
talks finished, Saburov gave an exclusive interview to a 
correspondent of the Ostankino radio and television company. 
  [Begin Saburov recording] We spoke about specific things 
connected with the need to begin economic reforms in Crimea. 
The situation is extremely difficult, extremely difficult. So 
we will hasten to take the measures to enable us to adopt a law 
on the division of powers between Ukraine and Crimea. We will 
act within the framework of Ukraine's law. Of course, not all 
of Ukraine's legislation facilitates reforms. Let us state this 
frankly. This is obvious from the standard of living both in 
Kiev and Crimea -- it needs to be improved. If the reforms in 
Russia are sometimes cursed for having reduced the standard of 
living there, I would advise the critics to come to Ukraine and 
see what happens when reforms are not carried out. It is a 
terrible situation. On the whole, the president's attitude 
toward our proposals was one of complete understanding, and 
since he is the upholder of the law, all of our activities 
carried out within the framework of the law will naturally be 
supported by him. [end recording]

  [Text] The Russian economist recently appointed deputy 
prime minister of Ukraine's Autonomous Republic of Crimea 
expressed satisfaction with a meeting he had with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  Yevgeniy Saburov told INTERFAX-Ukraine that the meeting, 
held 
on Tuesday, focused on "general aspects of the relations between 
Ukraine and Crimea." At the same time, "a fairly concrete 
matter was (also) given consideration, the beginning of economic 
reform in Crimea." "Since that matter doesn't contradict the 
law on the sharing of powers between Ukraine and Crimea, there 
couldn't have been much friction," Saburov said. 
  Asked whether the relationship between Ukraine and its 
autonomous republic could be based on a treaty, he said, "this 
would eliminate the problem of (Crimea's) secession (from 
Ukraine)." 
  As for the possibility of using the Russian ruble in Crimea, 
Saburov said, "cash rubles are in circulation in Crimea anyway, 
as they are in Kiev, for that matter." He said the Crimean 
government planned to shortly open ruble bank accounts for the 
autonomous republic's enterprises. "As for the idea that 
Russian Central Bank rubles could be poured into the economy of 
Crimea, who will give them to us?" Saburov said. 
  He said granting him Ukrainian citizenship was "under 
consideration." Saburov, who is a Russian citizen but needs 
Ukrainian citizenship to carry out his duties as deputy premier, 
said he favored dual citizenship for Crimea's population.

<F P=106> [Interview with Anatoliy Lupynis, head of the political </F>
department of the Ukrainian National Assembly, by Lyubomyra 
Blazhko; place and date not given: "If Only They Were Held..."] 
  [Excerpts] Our interlocutor is Anatoliy Lupynis, poet from 
Kiev. Some time ago, for his nationalist convictions, he had 
the good fortune to be imprisoned by our democratic authorities; 
he was also subject to repression by the communists. Today, he 
is head of the political department of the Ukrainian National 
Assembly [UNA]. He has never put forward his candidacy for a 
people's deputy seat, because he thinks the soviets are still 
soviets. 
  [Blazhko] Mr. Lupynis, how can you explain the present 
government's repressions against the Ukrainian National 
Assembly-Ukrainian National Self-Defense [UNA-UNSO]? 
  [Lupynis] It happened due to the fact that Ukraine has 
already lost 99 percent of its gains in the referendum held on 1 
December 1992. 
  The attack on UNA develops at the time when nuclear weapons 
are being transferred, our territory is being given up, and our 
highest state leadership has testified to its full incapability 
of opposing pressure from world imperial circles. In such a 
situation, all political organizations involved in ruling 
structures are participating in the process of Ukraine's 
surrender. All of them are engaged in sucking Ukraine's blood; 
during the past two years, a significant part of our national 
wealth has been transferred abroad, while not a cent has been 
received in return. Under such circumstances, the only force 
capable of resisting this is the UNA-UNSO. It is the only 
organization which has a mechanism for combating profiteering, 
firmly opposes the surrendering of our state, and is ready to 
stand to the last to prevent such developments. 
  I say "the only organization" not because of my alignment to 
it. Today, power is exercised jointly by traitors and thieves; 
today's power is an association of these two categories of 
criminals. 
  The UNA, which emerged as a nationalist organization and 
adheres to the principles of Ukrainian revolutionary 
nationalism, has come to the conclusion that, given the current 
circumstances, it would have been wrong to neglect social 
problems and break away with real processes in Ukraine. 
Therefore, UNA works for both forming national forces and 
uniting all social groups which are interested in true nation 
building, production, and the creation of normal living 
conditions for our people. 
  Today, Ukrainian society is divided into two groups uneven 
in 
both number and profit. The former is a group in power, which 
knows that its time will soon be over; therefore, it tries to 
sell abroad everything and reap as much as possible, 
transferring profits to accounts abroad. If a catastrophe were 
to happen in Ukraine, they would be cozily reading Ukrainian 
news somewhere in Miami. The latter includes all those who are 
interested in producing goods, establishing order, and building 
a real state. The Assembly aims at uniting all forces that are 
interested in producing goods, building the state, and creating 
a real defensive capacity, that is, at uniting all productive 
forces to abolish the power of profiteers. [passage omitted] 
  [Blazhko] The people do not believe anybody by now. Can you 
guarantee that the UNA will not betray the people? 
  [Lupynis] The UNA will not betray the people, because we are 
not democrats -- we are not playing this hypocritical game. We 
assess reality soberly and adequately. We are not going to fool 
the people with any law-governed states. I think that only an 
infantile man or a deliberate political charlatan can discuss 
democracy in this Mongolian and Bolshevik country. By all 
appearances, it will take several generations to install 
democracy here. Nobody has ever built a democratic society and 
law-governed state. Democracy is a state of society, which is 
attained as a result of the long-term establishment of moral, 
religious, ethical, and legal norms. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sevastopol -- Rear-Admiral Mykola Kostrov, deputy 
commander of Ukraine's Navy, who was at one time appointed by 
the Ukrainian Defense Ministry as chairman of the ministry's 
commission for inventory of the Black Sea Fleet assets, gave 
UNIAN his opinion about why such a commission was not set up by 
the Russian Defense Ministry. In his view, Russia is 
purposefully delaying the setting up of the commission, as well 
as the launch of the joint fleet review. One of the main 
reasons, the rear-admiral believes, is that "someone stands to 
lose from disclosing the facts of illegal use of property and 
funds, which unfortunately does happen in the Black Sea Fleet, 
and therefore, does not think it desirable." Mykola Kostrov 
recalled that the Black Sea Fleet command recently did all it 
could to prevent the commission, which arrived from Kiev and 
Moscow, from starting an inspection of one of the Black Sea 
Fleet fuel bases. Despite the commission's wide powers, the 
fleet command explained their actions saying that they were 
subordinate only to the two presidents, of Russia and Ukraine. 
They do, though, as a rule, obey orders, directives, and 
instructions coming from Russia's Defense Ministry and Navy 
headquarters. 
  Meanwhile, the rear admiral stressed, the delay of the 
commissions' work only tightens the knot of the Black Sea Fleet 
problems.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Gorshkov: "Candidate Deputies File </F>
Charges"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Conflicts </H5>
  As of yesterday the collegium on civil affairs of the St. 
Petersburg City Court had received about 10 complaints from 
candidate deputies to the City Assembly and election 
associations concerning the way the elections were conducted. 
  As deputy chairman of the city court, Nella Volzhenkina, 
reported, the range of complaints is very broad--from specific 
violations in the polling stations to demands to declare the 
results of the elections as a whole invalid. 
  Among the others was a complaint from the former City 
Council 
deputy Aleksey Kovalev about the actions of the mayor of St. 
Petersburg with respect to exercising the authority of the 
legislative organ of power. The plaintiff asks that the legal 
acts of the mayor's office published in violation of the 
Constitution be declared invalid. 
  Kovalev points out that since 22 December of last year, 
Anatoliy Sobchak has been performing the functions of an organ 
of representative power of a subject of the Russian Federation 
and local self-government on the territory of St. Petersburg. 
  At the same time Article 10 of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation says: "State power in the Russian Federation 
shall be exercised on the basis of separation into legislative, 
executive, and judicial. Organs of legislative, executive, and 
judicial power shall be independent." 
  In keeping with the Constitution, nobody may appropriate 
power in the Russian Federation. Seizure of power or 
appropriation of authority shall be persecuted according to 
federal law" [quotation marks as published]. 
  Thus, certain provisions of Edict of the President of the 
Russian Federation No. 2252, according to which the mayor 
actually concentrated the representative power in his own hands, 
contradicts the Constitution. Thus "laws and other legal acts 
in effect on the territory of the Russian Federation until the 
present Constitution takes effect shall be applied as long as 
they do not contradict the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation." 
  From this it follows that in his actions to exercise the 
authority of the legislative organ beginning 25 December 1993, 
the mayor of St. Petersburg proceeded from provisions that were 
not to be applied and violated the provisions of the 
Constitution. In Kovalev's opinion, these actions cause 
significant harm to the economic interests of the residents of 
the city. 
  The court has taken the applications under advisement. 
  On 24 March the Procuracy of St. Petersburg sent a protest 
to 
the City Court regarding the mayor's directive of 20 March 
concerning changing the procedure for voting in elections to the 
City Assembly, according to which the voting was continued for 
one more day. 
  Previously, Anatoliy Sobchak had rejected the protest sent 
to 
him from the Procuracy on 21 March regarding a similar matter. 
The mayor thinks that, in keeping with Edict of the President 
of the Russian Federation of 21 December 1993, Number 2252, "On 
Reform of Organs of State Power of St. Petersburg," he was 
instructed to the Statute on Elections to the City Assembly and 
schedule a date for conducting them.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Roshchina: "State Duma Deputies on the </F>
Situation in the Kray"] 
  [Text] Despite the bad weather, State Duma deputies (V. 
Nesterenko, V. Zelenkin, and I. Bespalov) held a news conference 
on 23 March in the former House of Political Enlightenment. 
Their visit to the kray was the result of an exacerbation of 
the conflict between the municipal and kray authorities, which 
ended with the events that are known to everyone. 
  For the sake of objectivity, the deputies first listened to 
the aggrieved side, and afterwards a series of meetings was held 
with the leadership of the kray, the kray UVD [Office of 
Internal Affairs], and the city and kray procuracies. In a long 
conversation with the governor, according to V. Zelenkin, the 
governor was forced to admit that the kray organs "went too far" 
in recent events. A conversation with K. Tolstoshein, the 
acting head of the city, did not transpire: He met the Moscow 
guests in such a way that, in the words of the same Zelenkin, 
"we were compelled to get up and leave." 
  The deputies were very restrained in their comments on the 
situation in the kray, declaring that they were not authorized 
to give a legal evaluation of the events. At the same time, 
they unanimously admitted that "the methods for changing the 
city leadership were absolutely improper, exceeding that which 
is authorized." V. Zelenkin also noted that despite the need to 
resolve local problems through local courts, he does not see any 
possibility of resolving them (the problems) without the 
intervention of the center and the General Procuracy, two of 
whose representatives were already in the country. Moreover, a 
representative of the Russian Human Rights Committee is also 
here today. 
  To the question as to whether the deputies were in the kray 
court and saw the court's decree on dismissing V. Cherepkov from 
his position, I. Bespalov answered that "we were not shown such 
a decree, and we saw only the decree of the procurator stating 
that it concurs with the kray court." 
  Regarding the appointment of Tolstoshein, the deputies 
remarked that according to the law, the head of the kray in the 
given circumstances can appoint anyone he wants, although now, 
incidentally, the Duma committee on local self-government, 
headed by V. Zelenkin, is considering a law that envisions an 
election procedure for electing the head of a local government. 
  Concerning mass discharges in the Grey House, the deputies 
could report only that they had not yet seen the pertinent 
documents, having received only an oral explanation of the 
reorganization of the managerial structure of the city that has 
taken place. In particular, as he told them, no one "dismissed" 
Gilgenberg--it was simply that the new structure did not provide 
for the position of city manager. 
  The result of the deputy trip will be a note addressed to 
the 
president, the State Duma, and the General Procuracy. They 
promised that they will try once again in the next few days to 
raise the "Vladivostok question" at a Duma meeting. The events 
in Vladivostok are so out of the ordinary, the deputies said, 
that they reverberate throughout Russia. 
  The opinion of the deputies on the postponement of the date 
of the kray elections is interesting: V. Zelenkin thinks that 
in this decision the governor of the kray violated an edict of 
the president that established the date for the conduct of 
elections at the end of March. However, in a telephone 
conversation with the chairman of the Central Election 
Commission, the latter affirmed that the postponement of the 
elections to a later date was authorized. 
  In the opinion of the deputies, rumblings in a number of 
regions where elections have been disrupted for one reason or 
another (mainly because of the passivity of the voters) should 
not delay the dates of elections to local representative organs.

<F P=106> [Reports by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova </F>
and by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] 
  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- "Another round of local 
elections in Russia confirmed once again that the popular 
feelings are sharply turning left," leader of the Communist 
Party of the Russian federation Gennadiy Zyuganov told ITAR-TASS. 
  In his opinion, the electors voted for "people with socially 
oriented thinking, and the alliance between patriots and 
supporters of a strong state is gaining in strength." Aman 
Tuleyev's victory in Kuzbass, which was "the stronghold of 
radical democrats quite recently", is convincing proof of it, 
Zyuganov believes. In his opinion, the same trend became 
prominent in Ukraine, which follows from the "convincing victory 
of the left-wing forces in eastern Ukraine and a strong support 
for state-oriented forces in the Crimea." Everywhere, with the 
exception of western Ukraine, "the opposition is being 
consolidated. Actually, it is the opposition to shock therapy 
and the breaking of ages-long ties between the three great 
Slavonic nations", Zyuganov continued. 
  Commenting on the situation in the Crimea, he pointed out 
that although the public opinion poll, held there, has no legal 
force, it does reflect people's feelings, and "both Moscow and 
Kiev will have to take it into account." 
  The Russian Communist leader said that the Communist party 
of 
the Russian Federation favoured the closest possible 
rapprochement of Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol, and not their 
drifting apart. "We shall hold a well-considered stand, aimed 
at improving relations between the Crimea, Ukraine and Russia... 
Nobody is encroaching upon anybody else's sovereignty, but 
there can be no real sovereignty, if economic relations are 
disintegrating," Zyuganov said. 
  Moscow March 30 TASS -- Thirty four members of the Communist 
Party of the Russian Federation were elected to representative 
bodies in subjects of the Federation at the local elections last 
Sunday. A total of 216 Communist candidates took part in the 
elections, a spokesman for the department for work with the 
territories at the president's administration told ITAR-TASS. 
  The activity of Communist candidates was rather high, but no 
more than 16 per cent of them won the elections. Thus, only two 
out of 27 Communist candidates got the needed number of votes in 
the Voronezh region, and as many in the Rostov region, where 31 
Communists were standing for election. One out of 20 Communist 
candidates was elected in the Kursk region.

  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- According to the specified, 
but still preliminary information, 38 per cent of the electorate 
took part in the Sunday elections to the representative bodies 
of power in subjects of the federation, a spokesman for the 
department for work with the territories at the president's 
administration told ITAR-TASS. Elections can be regarded as 
valid, if 25 per cent of electors took part in them, but still 
the activity of the population can hardly be described as high, 
although it is a little higher than during the previous stages 
of the electoral campaign. 
  In eight regions the voter turnout was more than 40 per 
cent. 
The figure was 63 per cent in the Ust-Ordynsky Autonomous 
District of Buryatia, which was the peak of activity. The 
population of two other autonomous districts also showed high 
activity: The representative bodies of power were fully formed 
in the Taymyr Peninsula and in the Evenk Autonomous District. 
  Activity was the lowest in the Samara and Magadan regions -- 
23 and 27 per cent respectively. Local dumas were not formed 
there.

  [Text] Chechen State Secretary Aslanbek Akbulatov has 
accused Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional Policies 
Sergey Shakhray of manipulating the Chechen problem for the sake 
of bolstering his political image. "It is outrageous to be 
trying to influence the developments in Chechnya from Moscow, 
not knowing the actual situation and alignment of political 
forces here," he told Interfax. 
  He said he was referring to Shakhray's recommendation 
concerning the Russian leadership's contacts with forces 
opposing President Dudayev. 
  "The Chechen leaders' attitude to such recommendations is 
far 
from positive. They believe that such a position may jeopardize 
the recently established dialogue," he added. 
  "I wouldn't like to think that all this is being done 
deliberately. I can say, however, that there is very much in 
common between the demands of individual Chechen opposition 
leaders and the recommendations of the Russian minister," 
Akbulatov said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Valeriy Vedernikov: "President's </F>
Representative Calls for Orenburg Oblast Elections To Be Deemed 
Invalid"] 
  [Text] Orenburg -- A scandal has erupted in Orenburg 
Oblast in connection with the results of the recent elections to 
the local representative organs of power. Were they valid or 
not? According to the oblast electoral commission this question 
can be answered in the affirmative. Of the 47 seats in the 
oblast legislative assembly 36 have acquired incumbents. And 
that enables the assembly to function on a legal basis even in 
this truncated form. In the remaining 11 districts the elections 
were deemed invalid because of the low turnout. 
  Vladislav Shapovalenko, the president's representative in 
Orenburg Oblast, broke the calm. He spoke on local television, 
accusing oblast electoral commission chairman Yu. Andreyev of 
arbitrariness and juggling with the election results. And he 
urged the oblast prosecutor to deem the elections in eight 
districts invalid. If his protest is satisfied the elections in 
the oblast as a whole will be deemed invalid. 
  In V. Shapovalenko's opinion the statute on the elections 
according to which the participation of 20 percent of the 
electorate is necessary for them to be deemed valid has been 
broken. But in the past the Central Electoral Commission has 
sent a specification to the localities according to which the 
percentage of turnout must be determined from the number of 
valid ballot slips. But in practice there is always a large 
difference between the number of voters and the number of ballot 
slips deemed valid. And that difference could be fatal for the 
eight districts. In terms of turnout they reached the necessary 
level. But some were tens of a percent and others hundreds of a 
percent short of the number of valid ballot slips required. 
  It should be noted that Yu. Andreyev was not acting alone. 
On election day he telephoned the Central Electoral Commission 
in Moscow several times and sought advice. As a result he was 
given the go-ahead to deem the elections in these disputed 
districts valid. The oblast legislative assembly thus become 
fully empowered, reaching the necessary two thirds of its makeup. 
  It will soon become clear how the conflict will end. But 
some people see in the position of the president's 
representative a morbid reaction to the crushing defeat of 
"Russia's Choice" and "Democratic Russia." Not one of their 
representatives got into the oblast legislative assembly. 
Actually, the bloc "against poverty, unemployment, and 
corruption," which included Communists, agrarian experts, and 
commodity producers and some others, did not win special laurels 
either. The head of the local Communists and the chairman of 
the oblast's union of commodity producers became deputies. It 
is true that the list of those elected contains many former 
party functionaries who were able to keep afloat. Despite the 
appeal from V. Yelagin, head of the oblast administration, to 
the leaders of rayon administrations not to submit their 
candidacies, the latter did not heed him. As a result 11 have 
become deputies. Even more seats were obtained by the directors 
of industrial enterprises and chairmen of former collective 
farms -- 19. The director of a commercial bank, the director of 
a commercial firm, and two journalists successfully passed 
through the sieve of the election campaign. 
  Elections to the Orenburg City Duma were invalid. Of 13 
deputies' seats only four were filled. Elections were invalid 
in a number of districts of other cities in the oblast. The 
election campaign cost 2.5 billion rubles. If the question of 
the contested districts is reviewed they may be considered to 
have been thrown to the wind.

  [Text] The Russian Federation Central Electoral Commission 
has confirmed the results of the elections to the Federation 
Council in Tatarstan. Farit Mukhametshin, chairman of the 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet, and Tatarstan President Mintimer 
Shaymiyev have officially been named deputies of the upper 
chamber of parliament. 
  The official results of elections to the State Duma in five 
electoral districts on Tatarstan territory have also been summed 
up. Gennadiy Yegorov, member of the republic "Unity for 
Progress" party, has been elected for Almetyevskiy electoral 
district no. 23; journalist Oleg Morozov has been elected for 
Moskovskiy electoral district no. 24; Vladimir Altukhov, 
director of a private enterprise, has been elected for 
Naberezhno-chelnininskiy electoral district no. 25; Gabdulvakhit 
Bagautdinov, director of a children's home, has been elected for 
Nizhnekamskiy electoral district no. 26; and Valentin Mikhaylov, 
Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet deputy, has been elected 
for Privolzhskiy electoral district no. 27. 
  Thus only deputies from the Chechen Republic and Chelyabinsk 
Oblast have not been elected to the Russian Federation Federal 
Assembly.

  [Text] Tiraspol, 29 Mar -- The 14th Army Military Council 
describes as a political provocation an amendment made on 15 
February to the unrecognised Dniester republic's law on the 
status of Russian troops stationed within the republic. 
According to the document, Russian troops' weapons, fighting 
equipment and other military property are declared the property 
of Tiraspol. 
  A statement by the Army Military Council issued today says 
that the Dniester authorities have demonstrated utter contempt 
of the Russian Federation and its efforts to uphold peace in the 
region. 
  Announcing that Tiraspol "is at state level encouraging the 
seizure of the 14th Army's sites, armaments and hardware," the 
military council of the Russian amalgamation of guards has 
lodged a strong protest with the Dniester authorities and demand 
that the law in question be repealed.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Ponomarev: "When There Is No Bread, </F>
Voters Have No Time For Manifestos"] 
  [Text] Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk -- The local legislative organ 
elections in the Far East were valid only on Sakhalin. But even 
on the island, where 51 candidates were running for the 16 seats 
in the oblast duma, the results were very different from what 
the organizers had expected. In two multiseat districts -- 
Korsakovskiy and Kholmskiy, which unite the central and southern 
parts of the oblast as well as the Kuril Islands -- only 
slightly more than 25 percent of registered voters turned out. 
The turnout in Tymovskiy District in northern Sakhalin was 
slightly higher at around 32 percent. But the most discouraging 
poll result was the fact that the elections were almost wholly 
ignored by the population of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk -- only 18 
percent of voters turned out. 
  It is possible that the weather played a mean trick on the 
election organizers -- as a result of heavy snow falls many 
residents of the south of the island had no water for several 
days, power supplies were intermittent, and no bread was 
delivered to the stores. 
  Nonetheless, the main cause of the Sakhalin people's 
political apathy, it seems to me, lies elsewhere. As one of 
Russia's most "expensive" regions, the island is drifting from 
one economic disaster to another. The lack of diversification 
in the old economy, geared mainly to fishing and timber 
procurement and enriching a narrow group of merchants and former 
members of the party nomenklatura, has left most of the 
population on its uppers, and there are only a few projects (of 
dubious worth from the islanders' viewpoint) as evidence of the 
widely trumpeted promises to "Taiwanize" Sakhalin and turn it 
into a kind of oil and gas El Dorado.

<F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Pisarev: "Administration Orders </F>
Stabilization"] 
  [Text] A state of emergency has been declared in Voronezh 
Oblast in order to stabilize finances in the social sphere, 
industry, and transport. In this connection Aleksandr Kovalev, 
head of the oblast administration, has signed several decrees 
instructing the financial administration to regulate the rayon 
and city budgets and thus, it is planned, even out the oblast 
budget deficit. 
  During the state of emergency period health care, education, 
social security, culture, and managerial structures will be on 
starvation rations -- they will be given the minimum funds 
needed to survive. Proposals aimed at cutting spending in these 
spheres are being given all kinds of backing. 
  The state tax inspectorate and the tax police have been 
given 
total carte-blanche. They have been ordered to step up checks 
to ensure that the oblast and local budgets receive full and 
timely revenue payments. 
  In effect Voronezh Oblast has decided to strengthen 
financial 
discipline by administrative means, tightening the screws in the 
loose reform mechanisms. On the other hand, evening out the 
budget deficit may be seen as a move toward retreat. I remember 
that censored military reports used to refer to a retreat as 
evening out the front line.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Todres under the "Province" rubric: </F>
"Boris Yeltsin Protects Krasnoyarsk Parliament"] 
  [Excerpt] Out of the 27 percent of Krasnoyarsk Kray 
residents who came to the polls on 27 March after all, nearly 
half also took part in the banned referendum. This was not out 
of their own disloyalty but owing to the slowness of 
presidential messengers. The edict signed by Boris Yeltsin the 
night before reached the polling stations only by the second 
half of the polling day. 
  The people of Krasnoyarsk were supposed to either approve or 
reject during their plebiscite the draft law crafted by the 
local administration "On the Foundations of Direct Sovereignty 
of the People and State Power." One of the kray's well-known 
politicians told your SEGODNYA correspondent that the law "was 
needed in order to bind up the legislative assembly once and for 
all," where, as things stand now, only five out of the 34 
deputies would constantly work there. For example, it had been 
planned to grant the administration's head the right to push the 
discussion of any awkward matter one month back merely by his 
directive (that is to "filibuster" it, considering that the 
session only takes place four times a year). Notably, all the 
governor's legislative initiatives would be entitled to be 
considered out of turn. 
  The referendum, however, was not canceled because of Boris 
Yeltsin's suddenly revived love for institutions of 
representative power. Local observers maintain that the main 
reason was the long-standing tensions between Governor Valeriy 
Zubov and Yuriy Moskvich, the president's representative in the 
kray. Knowing that the center mistrusts local referendums 
(especially in the Urals and Siberia), the latter was prompt to 
"present materials") to the president's staff. They say around 
the city that the edict that followed dealt an appreciable blow 
at Mr. Zubov. 
  The edict refers to the constitutional ban on putting to 
referendums regional charters and -- unless they have been 
agreed on in Moscow--questions on the status of a federation 
component. They point out in Krasnoyarsk that no charter was 
put to the plebiscite (only an individual law), and the changing 
of the kray's status (for example to that of a republic) was 
totally out of the question. In the opinion of Vyacheslav 
Novikov, head of the local Center for Strategic Projections, 
"the kray's authorities would surely win their case at the 
Constitutional Court, only the court does not work now."

  [Text] Krasnodar March 29 TASS -- The Krasnodar Territorial 
administration has decided to introduce a visa regime for 
residents of the former soviet republics as the territory is a 
border area on the Russian south. 
  Speakers at today's meeting of the territorial 
administration 
noted that the Kubans have managed to organize the protection of 
borders and public safety in the territorial border areas 
bearing in mind the on-going clashes in the Transcaucasian and 
North Caucasian republics. 
  They have formed check points and mobile groups. Cossack 
organizations have made 130 units to participate in operations 
together with the local police. 
  Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin told the meeting that 
the escalation of violence in the Krasnodar Territory has become 
stable and criminal terror has turned regular. Last year alone 
the Kuban police revealed 400 criminal groups with an overall 
strength of 1,000 people.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Americans Suggest That It Be Split </F>
Three Ways, Although It Is Not Enough Even for Two"] 
  [Text] That an ordinary intrigue is still present among 
methods of international diplomacy has once again been 
demonstrated by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry, who has 
proven yet another time the classical principle that "a country 
does not have either friends, or foes; what it does have is 
interests." 
  He became a source of a little -- albeit unpleasant for 
Russian politicians -- sensation. Upon arriving in Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] on an official visit just a few days before Yeltsin's 
meeting with Nazarbayev, Perry sent to Moscow a thoroughly 
confidential document. Your MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS correspondent 
has learned from official sources that the document signaled the 
Americans' readiness to act as a middleman between Russia and 
Kazakhstan in talks on the fate of Baykonur (of course, if the 
CIS countries themselves ask the White House to do so). 
  Evidently, the U.S. secretary's initiative is scarcely of 
any 
real value: at this moment relations between the two -- albeit 
former -- union republics wholly enable them to talk directly, 
without an interpreter. 
  But Moscow was politely reminded yet another time that a 
situation where Kazakhstan was in Russia's unquestioned sphere 
of influence is receding into the past. Indeed, investment 
attracted into the Central Asian country to finance specific 
projects alone already exceed $20 billion. 
  On the other hand, the document has elicited a certain 
distrust from Russian leaders: What if Perry has actually 
agreed on something behind the Kremlin's back while in Alma-Ata 
[Almaty] (which, as a matter of fact, may well be the case, too). 
  Although a document on Baykonur, among other things, was 
signed during the meeting between Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, which 
is considered very successful, one is getting the impression 
that the Moscow leaders find it more and more difficult to talk 
with their partners in the language of stern demands (including 
about military bases). Perry's letter appears to have played a 
part in bringing this about.

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 29 Mar, TASS -- "Citizens of the Crimean 
Republic have clearly confirmed their striving for integration 
with Russia for the second time within the past three months and 
supported the policy of Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov," 
ex-secretary of the Russian Supreme Soviet's Constitutional 
Commission and head of the Russian Fund for Constitutional 
Reforms Oleg Rumyantsev told ITAR-TASS here today. 
  Rumyantsev commented on results of the recent Crimean 
plebiscite. He said he has "close comradely relations" with 
Meshkov" and is trying to "render the Crimean Republic regular 
support in the sphere of state-legal development." 
  Rumyantsev is sure that Meshkov's policy aims not to 
separate 
the Crimea from Ukraine, but to settle relations with both 
Ukraine and Russia on the basis of agreements, create a single 
legal and ruble space, and "become a real integration 
locomotive." 
  In the opinion of the jurist, "if this policy is not ruined 
in Kiev or Moscow" the Crimea may become a bridge of cooperation 
in finances and double citizenship experiment. The Commonwealth 
does not have a single area to test double citizenship, he added. 
  The Russian Fund for Constitutional Reforms has been asked 
to 
develop a notion of a law on Crimean citizenship. "It will be 
very interesting to test the double citizenship idea (supported 
by Crimean residents) as this mechanism can play a key role in 
integration of the complex federal formation that appears on 
territory of the former Soviet Union," said Rumyantsev. 
  This would mean the sides mutually recognize juridical 
documents -- passports, graduate certificates and the like and 
the law enforcement bodies provide for human rights and freedoms 
on both territories. "Without any changes in borders or 
international-legal basic features, the double citizenship 
institute can help formation of a new single legal space," said 
Rumyantsev.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 29, BNS -- If the Saeima (parliament) 
ratifies the Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal accord, the 
National Independence Movement [LNNK] might consider 
resignation, faction member Aristids Lembergs told reporters 
Tuesday [29 March]. 
  Faction head Alexander Kirsteins, however, questioned the 
option as legally and technically impossible. The parliament 
may be dissolved exclusively by the president, according to the 
country's Constitution, said the faction's deputy head Andrejs 
Krastins. 
  If one of the factions withdrew from the parliament, the 
president may be forced to consider the parliament's 
dissolution, said Krastins. 
  LNNK has not discussed the resignation issue with other 
factions in the parliament's National Bloc yet but Lembergs 
predicted they could approve of the motion. 
  The National Bloc dislikes the Latvian-Russian agreement for 
concession to Russia's demands of the Skrunda radar operation 
and the social guarantees to war pensioners in return for Aug. 
31 as the withdrawal deadline. 
  The National Bloc includes parliament factions of LNNK, 
Homeland and Freedom, Christian Democrats Union. They have been 
pressuring President Guntis Ulmanis and the parliament not to 
sign and ratify the agreement since it was initialed on March 15.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>
  [Text] Riga, 30 Mar -- The Latvian Government has endorsed 
the package of agreements with Russia initialled by the 
delegations of both countries at talks in Moscow on 15 March. 
The cabinet of ministers considers the quick signing and 
ratification in the Saeima of these documents as "the only real 
guarantee of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian 
territory before 31 August this year," says the government 
statement adopted late evening on 29 March. The document 
stresses that the fixed term of the final troops pullout will 
enhance the possibility of international monitoring of this 
process. It also says that many countries have supported the 
initialled agreements and "have described them as a success of 
Latvian diplomacy." 
  Let us recall that of the four documents that form this 
package, the national forces have mostly criticized two: on 
temporarily maintaining the radio intercepting station in 
Skrunde and on the social protection of military pensioners. 
The government describes the treaty on the radar as a 
compromise and concedes that in the absence of an agreement the 
station would have been working uncontrollably for an indefinite 
period. The cabinet members believe this document will enable 
Latvia's cooperation with Western collective security systems 
and show Latvia's readiness to reach a compromise in the 
interests of the international community. As for military 
pensioners, the statement says their status will be defined by 
Latvian laws, "and the Russian side's claims that they should be 
granted citizenship have been turned down."

  [Text] Baku (March 29) TURAN -- The meeting of Azerbaijan's 
and Armenia's experts as well as the representatives of Armenian 
and Azeri communities of Nagorno-Karabakh took place on March 
20-25 through the mediation of Russian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. The talks were chaired by Russian President's special 
envoy on the settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, 
Vladimir Kazimirov. Deputy Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Group, 
Mathias Mosberg, and the leaders of the CSCE monitoring mission, 
General Burg and Berkman also participated at the meeting. 
  The expert of Azeri delegation, Tofik Zulfugarov, told TURAN 
that the mediator presented its draft of the agreement to both 
parties. 
  The draft stipulates for cease-fire and liberation of 
territories occupied by Armenia. 
  "It was difficult to find agreements with Armenia since it 
does not wish to liberate Kelbadzharskiy and Lachinskiy regions 
of Azerbaijan. The experts discussed the draft of the agreement 
proposed by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The draft must 
be reviewed by the mediator taking into account several 
amendments and then will be presented to Azerbaijan's and 
Armenia's top powers as well as to the leaders of Azerbaijan's 
and Armenia's communities of Karabakh", said Zulfugarov. 
  Armenian experts insisted on liberation of a part of 
Azerbaijan's occupied territories with exception of Lachinskiy 
and Kelbadzharskiy regions. Those two regions will be liberated 
if Nagorno-Karabakh exists as a sovereign republic. 
  Azeri party offered the opposite, that is liberation of all 
territories occupied by Armenian troops and then Azerbaijan's 
and Armenia's communities will decide the matter concerning the 
status of Nagorno-Karabakh themselves. However, territorial 
integrity of Azerbaijan must be maintained. 
  Last week [as received] Kazimirov's and Mosberg's missions 
will arrive in Azerbaijan, reports Azerbaijan Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Unofficial Georgian-Abkhazian consultations on the 
question of settling the conflict in Abkhazia have begun in 
Moscow at the Foreign Ministry. Fighting is continuing in the 
region, and the reports coming from there are very 
contradictory. Thus, Abkhaz sources reported yesterday evening 
a victory in the Kodori gorge; Georgian sources refute this 
report. In our bulletin tonight, we have reportage from both 
sides of the trenches: 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Medeya Akhalkatsi] Since 
nightfall, Abkhaz formations have been carrying out very 
intensive shelling against the Georgian mountain village of 
Zemo-Lada using heavy equipment, mortars, and large-caliber 
artillery. The Gudauta side has begun using banned phosphorous 
shells and Grad systems. Several helicopters are periodically 
bringing in additional personnel and military equipment from the 
direction of Sukhumi. Despite this, Georgian border troops and 
volunteer units are managing to contain the attack and to hold 
their positions. There are dozens of dead and wounded on both 
sides as a result of the constant battles. There are also 
casualties among the civilian population. Thousands of people 
are leaving their homes and swelling the already large list of 
displaced persons. Women and children are being evacuated first. 
  [Correspondent Ruslan Khashig] The situation in the Kodori 
gorge in Abkhazia is fully under the control of the republic's 
armed forces today. The government of Abkhazia is taking urgent 
measures these days to normalize life in the villages of 
Nizhnyaya and Verkhnyaya Lata. Local authorities are being 
restored, and foodstuffs are being delivered there. As a result 
of the operation, units of Georgian troops who had been dug in 
at Lata since last autumn have now been driven out. These units 
are currently blockaded in the mountain village of Azhara. [end

  [Text] As the IZVESTIYA newspapaer said today, initial 
information on the contents of the black boxes from the Russian 
Airbus that crashed in Siberia has been received from Paris. 
The catastrophe on 22 March killed 75 people. 
  [Unidentified correspondent over video of crash site] The 
results of the analysis of the contents of the black boxes are 
to be announced tomorrow. However it is already known today 
that despite earlier interpretations, the crew of the Airbus 
were alive and continuing to converse among themselves in the 
last few minutes of flight. Specialists will, therefore, have 
to refute the theory that the catastrophe came about as a result 
of instantaneous decompression. The Russian experts in Paris 
will attempt to identify the pilots' voices and draw up a 
precise transcript of the conversation. 
  At the same time, the other box, in which the functional 
parameters of all the components of the Airbus are recorded, is 
being decoded. The information retrieval process will probably 
take up until the end of this week, and the results of the 
decoding will be passed to members of the investigative 
commission. Only then will the final verdict be made.

recorders of the A-310 Airbus which crashed in Siberia taking a 
toll of 75 lives proved that the version about depressurisation

  However, an act of terrorism against the craft is not

  Deciphering is carried out jointly by experts of the French 
Transport Ministry and their Russian colleagues.

  [Text] At a Tuesday news conference at the Russian State 
Duma the leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy declared his determination to fight against 
"Kazakh, Uzbek, Kirgiz fascism and defend the Russian-speaking 
population." He promised to respond "with such a blow that 
those countries will forget what civilization is" because they 
will be turned into "scorched wasteland with nobody to save." 
Only in this way will they learn not to humiliate Russians and 
pay for all their atrocities at once. 
  Zhirinovskiy emphasized that with the present attitude to 
Russians in Kazakhstan he would never let President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev "even approach the border of the Russian state." He 
called Nazarbayev a representative of a pseudo-state and said he 
would never sign any treaties or agreements with the man. 
  Speaking of the work of the Liberal-Democratic group in the 
Duma Zhirinovskiy described as its achievement the adoption of 
the amnesty decision. He was sorry, however, that he did not 
receive any official thanks from the former vice-president 
Aleksandr Rutskoy, the former security minister Viktor 
Barannikov or the former deputy interior minister Andrey Dunayev 
who were released from Lefortovo prison as a result of the 
amnesty. 
  Zhirinovskiy claimed that he received an expression of 
gratitude from the leader of the Russian National Unity movement 
Aleksandr Barkashov, the head of the Officers' Union Stanislav 
Terekhov and General Vladislav Achalov. "Not everyone proved 
thankful, perhaps someone should have been left in jail." 
  Zhirinovskiy claimed the credit for the latest foreign 
policy 
successes of the country related to the prevention of the 
bombings of Serbian positions around Sarajevo. He threatened 
the Foreign Ministry, which he described as a nest for CIA 
agents, that he would hold diplomats responsible for what they 
have done in the past two or three years. 
  He went on to accuse other parties in the Duma of stealing 
votes from his party during the elections. He claimed that at 
least 25 percent of votes were stolen at polling stations and 
given over "to such pseudo-parties as Russia's Choice and the 
Yavlinskiy bloc." According to Zhirinovskiy, some votes were 
also stolen from Communists, but while Communists are ready to 
forgive that, Liberal- Democrats will not. In the future he 
promised to hold politically responsible those who collected 
votes by fraud. 
  Zhirinovskiy forecast that in the 1996 parliamentary 
elections Liberal-Democrats would get not less than 300 out of 
450 seats (40 percent lawyers, 40 percent economists, 20 percent 
Army and Navy representatives). 
  Zhirinovskiy invited all newspapers and broadcasting 
corporations as well as all political parties and movements to 
the congress of his party in Moscow this weekend. He estimated 
that the congress would cost Liberal-Democrats some Rbs 60 Mn. 
  Answering a question on why he insisted on the release of 
all 
inmates of Lefortovo, even though his potential rival in the 
presidential elections Aleksandr Rutskoy was among them, 
Zhirinovskiy said that he needs a strong competitor. "If there 
is no one beside me, there is no one to fight against and I get 
sour," the Liberal-Democratic leader said. 
  However, he did not think many people would vote for Rutskoy 
because he "constantly changes his political image and has 
betrayed his stand four or five times." 
  Zhirinovskiy stressed that the president should have given 
the party that won the elections the right to form a cabinet a 
long time ago. He claimed that cabinet members Chubays, 
Shokhin, Kozyrev and Shakhray are right in their fears about his 
possible transition to the Kremlin. 
  "On 12 December we already received a mandate to the 
Kremlin," he said. 
  Answering a question about Liberal-Democratic deputies 
Viktor 
Kobelev and Aleksandr Pronin, Zhirinovskiy said that last month 
both were expelled from the party and the party group in the 
Duma. He said that the party is not threatened with a split, 
and the fact that three or four people leave the party every 
year is a normal process. 
  "Annually all intelligence services of the world are trying 
to infiltrate us. This is an indicator of our strength," 
Zhirinovskiy believes. 
  He said the party is ready to sign the memorandum of accord 
proposed by the president, but the document is more likely to 
have a moral significance and it would be naive to think that 
civic peace will be restored immediately after its adoption. 
  Zhirinovskiy announced that during the first half of the 
year 
he plans to visit Norilsk, Yakutia, Magadan, Kamchatka, Sakhalin 
and the Far East as well as Finland and Strasbourg.

  [Text] Kharkov, 28 March -- Elections were valid in every 
constituency, but none of them elected a people's deputies. In 
almost every constituency competition was mainly between MBR

one hand, and the SPU [Socialist Party of Ukraine] and CPU 
[Communist Party of Ukraine] on the other. In the Kharkov's 14 
constituencies, (?eight) SPU and CPU members went through to the 
second stage. Among the candidates going through to the second 
round are current People's Deputies Volodymyr Hrynyov, with 35.8 
percent of the vote, Valeriy Meshcheryakov, with 13.6 per cent 
in Radyanskyy Electoral District No. 376, Mykola Koshlyakov, 
with 26.7 percent, and Volodymyr Filenko, with 18.6 percent in 
Zhovtnevyy Electoral District No. 386.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Novikov: "Strike Committees Are Politicized"] </F>
  [Text]]While creating strike committees in 
productions included in the Kirovskiy Zavod Association, the 
consolidated Kirovskiy trade union committee suggests creating a 
citywide strike committee as well. In the words of the 
association's trade union leader, Vladimir Yudin, the task of 
the strike committee today is not to organize but, on the 
contrary, to warn about protest actions. 
  The most politically active Kirovskiy Zavod has it no worse 
than other enterprises of the city. The average wages are close 
to 200,000 rubles [R]. Only about 4,000 people have been laid 
off from the tractor and former tank productions, but they 
receive a stipend of 44,000. For steel smelters who have work 
orders, the wages are generally twice the average. Nonetheless, 
the workers, in Yudin's words, are prepared for protest actions, 
and the steel smelters are guaranteeing their support for the 
unemployed tractor builders. The reason, in the opinion of the 
plant trade union committee, is that the labor collectives 
consider the present economic reforms to be a blind alley. 
Taxes and prices raised by monopolists will sooner or later 
destroy the economy completely. 
  The consolidated city strike committee could also put 
pressure on central and regional authorities in order to develop 
a new economic policy. The strike committees of specific 
productions must "apply pressure" on the administrations of the 
enterprises, but not so as to gain any concessions but so that 
the employer too will influence the government on his own 
behalf. In other words--the strike committees are becoming 
politicized.

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Black Sea Fleet continues to be a bone of 
contention between Ukraine and Russia. Vladimir Bezkorovannyy, 
commander of Ukraine's Naval Forces, believes the naval vessels 
of the coastal service of the Black Sea Fleet must be divided 
equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the opinion of 
Valeriy Kuznetsov, adviser to the Crimean president for military 
issues, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training even 
with the minimum of vessels at its disposal. 
  The Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in 
all; of these only five are Ukrainian. At the same time, as 
Valeriy Kuznetsov emphasized, Ukraine has substantially 
increased the number of its ground armed forces on the territory 
of Crimea. Here there are now about 50,000 Ukrainian servicemen 
together with their construction units. 
  Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are taking 
place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea is 
Russian in spirit.

  [Text] Kiev, 30 Mar -- It has become known from 
well-informed sources that an agreement was signed between in 
the 20's of March [20-29 March] between the Governments of 
Ukraine and Turkmenistan on the payment of Ukraine's debt for 
1993 and payment for the supply of natural gas in the first half 
of 1994. In accordance with the agreement's conditions, the 
government of Ukraine, in the person of Valentyn Landyk, deputy 
prime minister for issues of foreign economic activity, is 
handing over the debt for gas equaling U.S. $671,900,000 to the 
"Respublika" corporation, which was recently set up in Kiev. 
The corporation has also assumed the obligation to pay for 
deliveries of Turkmen gas for 1994 to the value of $500 million. 
  In accordance with the agreement's conditions, 35 percent of 
the said totals should be paid in cash. The remainder should be 
compensated to Turkmenistan by Ukrainian goods, which in fact 
means the consolidation of the system of export quotas and 
licenses. In the event that the "Respublika" corporation does 
not fulfill its obligations in paying off the debt, Ukraine's 
government is to pay it. That is, under the agreement the 
mediator does not bear any financial responsibility. 
  Experts note that the resale of state debt to nonstate 
structures is an extremely dangerous matter. These means are 
only used after a country has been officially declared bankrupt 
(for example by The Hague arbitration court). We will note that 
payment for the mediation operations of the "Respublika" 
corporation could be from 3 to 8 percent of the total debt, 
which is from 35 to $94 million. In addition, the mediator 
becomes a monopolist of 10-15 percent of Ukraine's total 
exports. The emergence of a commercial mediator in interstate 
relations evokes the surprise of experts. We emphasize that in 
accordance with the law, such agreements become valid only after 
ratification by Ukraine's Supreme Council.

  [Text] The commander of the CIS peacekeeping force in 
Tajikistan said he saw no reasons for Tajikistan to have an army 
of its own. 
  "Large-scale aggression against Tajikistan is out of the 
question, although groups of 50 to 200 men might try to break 
into the territory of the Republic, hoping to get support from 
groups within (Tajikistan) and pursuing political aims," 
Colonel-General Boris Pyankov told reporters in Dushanbe on 
Wednesday. He said he was sure the 15 April deadline for the 
peacekeepers' presence in Tajikistan would be moved to 31 
December. 
  Pyankov said all financial and other problems the 
Commonwealth force initially faced had been solved. He said 
Russia was paying 50 percent of the expenditure for the 
peacekeepers, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were paying 15 percent 
each, and Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan 10 percent each. 
  The general said Tajikistan's leadership wished the force to 
be enlarged and that it might suggest that Armenia, Ukraine and 
Belarus send in reinforcements. But he doubted that Belarus 
would send in any troops, its legislation banning the use of its 
armed forces outside its territory. 
  Pyankov on the whole expressed approval of the idea of 
having 
more CIS states involved in the peacekeeping mission, for this 
would "eliminate all mistrust and give the lie to the 
accusations that Russia acts as an imperial power." 
  He said the initiative for giving the peacekeepers the 
status 
of a U.N. force had nearly been killed off, the United Nations 
being unable to fund it. But Russia is ready to pay for its 
peacekeepers anywhere in the CIS if the United Nations 
recognizes those expenses as Russia's payments for U.N. 
peacekeeping missions, Pyankov said. He said a proposal to that 
effect might be made to U.N. secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, currently visiting Moscow.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Vladimir Berezovskiy: "Pamir Poise </F>
between War and Peace"] 
  [Text] Tashkent -- The threat of the avalanche of civil war 
again hangs over the Pamir. According to reports from Tajik 
military, in the Afghan provinces of Takhar and Kondoz, 
opposition combat detachments' reinforced wit armored vehicles 
are accumulating. Abdullo Nuri, leader of the Tajikistan 
Islamic Renewal Council, recently issued another bellicose 
statement about his readiness to continue the armed struggle 
"against Emomali Rakhmonov's antipopular regime." 
  The tactical exercises by the CIS coalition peacekeeping 
forces in "Tigrovaya balka," which ended last Thursday, were a 
kind of reply to this. Soldiers and officers of the 201st 
Russian motorized rifle division, the Tajik Army, and an Uzbek 
battalion took part. A scenario for the repelling of a massive 
attack from the direction of Afghanistan was rehearsed. The 
engines of tanks, armored personnel carriers, helicopters, and 
Tu-22F "Backfire" strategic aircraft roared in the mountain 
gorges. Coalition Peacekeeping Forces Commander Boris Pyankov 
believes that the scenario which is being rehearsed could be 
real. "It is true that I would not like it very much to 
happen," the colonel general added, "but Allah alone knows how 
it will all turn out." 
  Whether Tajikistan will fall into the abyss of a new 
fratricidal bloodbath depends largely on the success of the 
talks between the opposition and official Dushanbe. Talks on 
the subject have long been under way, but the first outlines of 
the meeting -- it is planned to hold it in Moscow -- have been 
carved more or less clearly. 
  Delegations of seven people each are to sit down at the 
conference table, and the opposition has received a guarantee of 
safety. At UN insistence, the talks should begin without any 
preliminary conditions. The sides have something to discuss. 
There is the fate of hundreds of thousands of refugees scattered 
not only in neighboring Afghanistan, but also throughout the 
former Union, the collapse of the Tajik economy, and the future 
identify of the state and power structures. But, of course, the 
most important thing is to put an end to the bloodshed, without 
which getting out of the rockfall of problems descending on the 
young independent republic is inconceivable. 
  Obviously, the peace process in Tajikistan is encountering a 
series of underground rocks. Thus, the radical opposition 
defending its interests with weapons in hand is insisting that 
the delegation include Chief Justice Khodzhi Akbar Turadzhonzod, 
the Muslims' former spiritual leader, and Mukhammad Sharif 
Khimmatzad, leader of the banned Islamic Revival Party. They 
are both regarded in Dushanbe as the main culprits in unleashing 
civil war. For the Tajikistan leadership, sitting down at the 
same table with them means recognizing them as equals and in 
part "losing face." Most likely Dushanbe's strategic partner, 
Uzbekistan, also opposes this twist to the affair. It is hardly 
fortuitous that a criminal trial began in Tashkent recently of a 
group of officials of the Central Asia Muslims' spiritual 
directorate. Arrested nearly a year ago, they are accused not 
only of large-scale embezzlement, but also of transferring 
$200,000 to the Tajik Muslim leaders to buy weapons. If the 
guilt of the "servants of Allah" is proven, and there are few 
doubts that it will be, then the Turkestan public will be even 
more convinced of "who is who" and Dushanbe will acquire new 
trump cards. 
  The Tajikistan authorities obviously consider it acceptable 
for them to conduct talks with the so-called moderate 
opposition, which has united in a democratic forces coordination 
center with headquarters in Moscow. Representatives of 
"Rastokhez" and other organizations are of course far less 
involved in the bloody disputes and have nothing to do with the 
fierce terrorist actions. And it may be expected that official 
Dushanbe will soon find a common language with them. 
  At the same time the situation in Tajikistan itself is not 
that simple. It is no secret that a decisive role in the 
victory of the progovernment forces was played by the National 
Front, where the Kulyab people set the tone. Today, they have 
occupied the majority of key posts in the capital and locally, 
and that has destroyed the traditional balance of power 
artifically maintained in the past by the Communists. 
  Gornyy Badakhshan remains a zone of heightened tension. The 
drugs mafia have a strong hold there. The former harmony 
between Tajiks and local Uzbeks is lacking there. Not to 
mention the Russians, who are still leaving the Pamir in droves 
since it has become a danger to their lives. 
  It is characteristic that Tajikistan's opposition and 
official powers are in favor of good relations with Russia. 
That of course attests to their realism. Moscow, with its CIS 
allies, is doomed to be a guarantor of peace in the Pamir. 
Formally its troops should leave Tajikistan at the end of this 
year, but that is unlikely if only because, as Pavel Grachev put 
it, the border with Afghanistan must be held because of the 
strategic interests of Russia and the CIS. 
  Probably as a reserve option in case the talks fail, at a 
recent meeting of the foreign ministers of Uzbekistan, 
Kirghizia, Tajikistan, Russia, and Kazakhstan in Dushanbe Andrey 
Kozyrev suggested convening an international conference with the 
participation of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. But will that 
suit the opposition, which will most likely observe this meeting 
from the sidelines? 
  One thing is clear: We must not lose the chance of a 
political solution to the Tajik problem. That is fraught not 
only with the danger of the aggravation of the conflict, but 
also with the danger of its spread throughout Turkestan, 
dragging into the crater of war new participants, among whom the 
greatest danger is presented by the Afghan mojahidin and the 
extremists from the fundamentalist organizations of the Muslim 
world.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from an interview with Lieutenant General </F>
Mamedrafi Mamedov, Azerbaijan defense minister, by Beshir 
Sherifov; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sherifov] We systematically broadcast the Defense 
Ministry's reports every day. But, in the present conditions it 
would be more interesting to hear about the situation from the 
minister himself. 
  [Mamedov] At present the situation on our borders is 
favorable. We have strengthened our positions. We want to 
create an army. It must be created whether or not there is a 
war. A strong country and state should have a strong and proper 
army. The entire people and society should be involved in the 
war. We should have evicted the Armenians a long time ago. I 
would like to ask: Who is to defend the Azerbaijani soil? We 
ourselves, the Azerbaijani people. Where are they [deserters] 
trying to flee? Why and from whom they are escaping?. From 
ourselves, our own country, mothers, sisters, or brothers? 
Therefore, availing myself of this opportunity I am informing 
all the deserters, both soldiers and officers, that in 15 days 
we will start changing the military certificates and personal 
documents. All military personnel must carry their document 
with them. Those who do not will be regarded as deserters, be 
they soldiers or officers. Therefore, I am informing them that 
they still have time, until 15 April. They must return to their 
military units by 15 April. After that, we will issue no 
military documents to anyone. The state will take a very stern 
approach to them. 
  [Sherifov] The military laws must be obeyed unconditionally? 
  [Mamedov] Of course. I would very much like for you to put 
them on television so that their fathers, sisters, brothers, 
friends, and relatives could see these deserters. There are 
cases when the son escapes and his father comes and takes his 
place at the front. Beloved son, where is the morality in this? 
Who will defend this country? The war will end sooner or later. 
  I now ask the deserters: How will they dare to look in the 
faces of their friends and acquaintances serving in the same 
unit? 
  [Sherifov] Finally, many are trying to forecast the duration 
of the war--that is, when and how it will end. As defense 
minister, what is your forecast, and do you believe such a 
prognosis can be made? 
  [Mamedov] I cannot say that the war will end in a month or 
within six months. It is not possible to make such a forecast, 
because the enemy cannot be regarded as weak. We cannot say: 
The enemy is weak so let's launch an attack. We must gather 
information on the strength of the enemy and then launch an 
attack. I do not approve of sending our beloved sons to 
martyrdom for no reason at all. Therefore, it is not possible 
to state definitely that the war will end in one or two months. 
It would be inappropriate to say such a thing. Whether the war 
ends in one month, half a year, or eight months depends on our 
deserters, the entire nation, and society. Some think that the 
war is something apart from the people. No. The war is a 
question of the honor of the people. 
  [Sherifov] One should rely on one's own people? 
  [Mamedov] A country relies on its people during wartime. If 
the people hide their sons, then who is going to take part in 
the war? We cannot expect people to come from other countries, 
from Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan, and participate in it and 
defend Azerbaijani soil. This cannot be. That is the answer to 
your question.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- A delegation of the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly will set off tomorrow on a tour of 
Transcaucasian republics in search for ways of settling the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. 
  The delegation, headed by Kyrgyz parliament chairman 
Medetkan 
Sherimkulov, is made up of representatives of Russia, Kyrgyzia 
and Belarus. The CIS parliamentarians are scheduled to visit 
Baku, Yerevan and Stepanakert, and meet Azerbaijani, Armenian 
and Nagorno-Karabakh leaders. 
  The previous tour by CIS lawmakers of the Transcaucasia with 
a peacekeeping mission was taken last September. The 
parliamentarians met for three times with Azerbaijani President 
Geydar Aliyev, discussed the possibilities of resolving the 
crisis with Armanian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan and the 
Nagorno-Karabakh leadership. The delegation also visited 
Azerbaijan's border regions and makeshift camps of refugees in 
the Belyagan and Barda districts, met heads of district 
administrations. The tour resulted in an agreement between the 
CIS parliamentary delegation and the Karabakh leaders about a 
month-long ceasefire and partial return of refugees to their 
homes. According to the lawmakers, to finally settle the 
Karabakh conflict, the warring sides will need time, patience 
and negotiating skills. 
  A new impetus was imparted to CIS parliamentarians' 
peacekeeping efforts by the Moscow meeting of Armenian and 
Azerbaijani defence ministers with the participation of a 
Nagorno-Karabakh representative. The meeting was held in 
February at the initiative of the Russian defence minister and 
resulted in an agreement on a complete ceasefire and gradual 
settlement of the conflict. 
  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev met on Wednesday 
with 
Sherimkulov to discuss the forthcoming trip by the CIS 
Interparliamentary Assembly mission to Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  After the meeting, the Kyrgyz parliament speaker told TASS 
that at the moment the interparliamentary peacekeeping group was 
arranging a meeting of Armenian, Azerbaijani and Karabakh 
lawmakers in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. 
  "We would like to hope that our activities will help restore 
peace. People are tired of war, of increasing numbers of 
refugees. None of the states will profit by this", Sherimkulov 
stressed. "if we manage to promote rapprochement between the 
warring sides, we would consider our mission helpful", he said. 
  A senior official of the Russian Foreign Ministry told 
reporters that the ministry fully supported the intention of the 
CIS Interparliamentary Assembly's peacekeeping group to promote 
the Nagorno-Karabakh settlement. According to him, the Russian 
Foreign Ministry "is working in close coordination (with the 
group) and is ready to render an expert assistance in the 
activities conducted by the group". Russian diplomats beleive 
this group "may play a special role, since parliamentarians can 
help create a favourable atmosphere for concluding an agreement, 
which is presently being drafted by executive structures". 
  According to the Foreign Ministry high-ranking official, the 
main thing to do now is "to bring the sides together, to create 
a proper atmosphere for signing an agreement to halt the 
conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh". The agreement has already being 
worked out in principle. Each of the conflicting sides has its 
own approaches, therefore it will certainly take much effort to 
have the agreement signed, the diplomat stressed.

  [Text] Leader of the Karabakh delegation, Head of the 
Karabakh Foreign Ministry's Department for International 
Organizations Masis Mailian, said that the recent talks between 
Azerbaijani, Armenian and Karabakh experts, under Russia's 
mediation, were very useful. 
  To quote Mailian, the strong point of the talks was the 
participation of the CSCE's Minsk Group, which helped coordinate 
Russia's and CSCE's peace efforts. 
  He announced that Karabakh had amended the draft agreement 
on 
the termination of the armed conflict and gradual elimination of 
its repercussions, presented by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
  He expressed regret that Azerbaijan's position was non- 
constructive and did not reflect the current situation. 
  He reiterated Karabakh's readiness to cooperate with neutral 
mediators.

  [Text] Abulfaz Elchibey, the deposed president of 
Azerbaijan and leader of the People's Front, commented on the 
political future of current President Geydar Aliyev and the 
latter's desire to hand over the country to the Russians. 
  Claiming that various provocations are being made to disband 
the People's Front, which opposes this policy, Elchibey called 
on the democratic forces in the country to unite against Aliyev. 
  In his statement made at Keleki in Ordubadskiy Rayon where 
he 
has been exiled, Elchibey pointed out that many high-ranking 
officials of the People's Front were detained on trumped-up 
charges and vowed: "We will continue our struggle until 
Azerbaijan becomes an independent state." 
<H5>  He is Bringing the Russians Into the Country </H5>
  Noting that the Aliyev regime wants to silence not only the 
People's Front but also all democratic institutions, deposed 
President Elchibey said that the police is in control of roads 
leading to Ordubadskiy and reporters, in particular, are 
prevented from entering the region. 
  Speaking to a small group of reporters, Elchibey strongly 
criticized Geydar Aliyev and said the present government has 
achieved nothing. He said: "While in power we managed to expel 
nearly 30,000 Russian soldiers from the country. Now, Aliyev 
wants to reintroduce them into the country. Despite his 
expressed opposition to this in statements abroad and on 
television, he is underhandedly exerting enormous effort in this 
direction. The Russian troops that are to be brought to the 
republic, ostensibly to protect the peace, will cause new 
bloodshed." 
  Stressing that Azerbaijan has regressed in economic and 
political fields since the Aliyev administration assumed power, 
Elchibey noted that despite all these negative developments 
Aliyev is neglecting everything and is battling the People's 
Front and other democratic forces. 
<H5>  They Are Muffling Our Voice </H5>
  Pointing out that the leaders of the People's Front and many 
people working for the freedom of the country have been detained 
in recent days, Elchibey said: "It seems that they consider the 
democratic forces more dangerous than the Armenians; that is why 
they have dropped everything to battle us. They are detaining 
our members and preventing reporters from seeing us. They are 
trying to prevent our voice from reaching the outside world." 
  Touching on the war with Armenia, Elchibey indicated that 
Aliyev is lying both to the outside world and the Azerbaijani 
people, and said: "Aliyev frequently appears on television and 
announces the liberation of Fizuli and Agdam or advances of our 
Army with no casualties on our side. The fact is that our side 
had 14,000 martyrs within 45 days. More than 20,000 were 
injured. None of the six lost regions, not even a single 
village, has been recovered."

<F P=106> [Report by Arif Useynov: "Manats Float"] </F>
  [Text] Baku -- The manat -- the national monetary unit of 
Azerbaijan -- has had a difficult time. It is losing value not 
by the day but by the hour. To cover up this patent devaluation 
the National Bank of Azerbaijan periodically sets a new manat 
rate against the currencies of the former Union republics. 
  The initial rate was confusing -- one manat to 10 Russian 
rubles [R]. Why not 20? Commercial bank specialists have 
reason to call a "ceiling" -- this arbitrarily established rate 
has not been borne out by any exchange trading. So what 
prompted the new rate of one to 14? 
  As a rule, attempts to discern the economic laws on which 
the 
exchange rate is based prove pointless. 
  On the currency black market -- the famous "Molokanka" (from 
the name of a pleasant little square in downtown Baku) -- people 
are trading at a rate of R1,000 to 275 manats, paying no 
attention to the bankers' sluggishness. The people on the 
square do not rule out the possibility that in a month or so a 
ruble could be worth the same as a manat. 
  Hyperinflation has long been part and parcel of the 
Azerbaijani economy, forcing the manat into the most improbable 
contortions. This was to be expected: Deformations in the 
economy seem to happen on their own, and the manat has been left 
to its own devices, as if orphaned. Despite the fact that state 
property has not been privatized and the mechanism of market 
relations has not been fully realized, the new manat has been 
allowed to float. No currency can function normally without a 
weight of goods to back it -- and home-produced goods at that. 
Having failed to make deliveries of output and goods outside 
the republic under the clearing system, enterprises have been 
deprived of reciprocal shipments worth 6 billion manats. Half 
of last year's cotton and grape crops were not harvested. 
Meanwhile 80 percent of foodstuffs are bought on the side for 
foreign currency -- weak petrodollars. And these are getting 
fewer and further between, since oil extraction in the republic 
has fallen by 800,000 tonnes. 
  There is no harm in admitting that home-grown businessmen 
are 
making a good living from the people's baleful position. The 
state owes 22 billion manats in wages and pensions, while 
ministries, departments, enterprises, and commercial structures 
are keeping R27 billion that they owe to others in Russian bank 
accounts, earning fabulous rates of interest. 
  President Heydar Aliyev has demanded that the leaders of 
debtor organizations repatriate forthwith their exported capital 
or the products that have been bought with it. Meanwhile 
specialists believe that the hidden billions are unlikely to 
save the Azerbaijani economy. The following weighty argument is 
also quoted: Transactions with Russian banks are not effective 
[ne deystvuyut], and the Central Bank of Russia is hardly likely 
to agree to such operations, recalling Azerbaijan's large debts. 
  Has not the time come to print larger-denomination manats? 
Those in circulation cannot keep up with galloping prices. The 
consignment of manats expected to arrive from France will be 
enough to pay the wage and pension backlog. 
  And the manat continues to float.

  [Text] Yerevan March 30 TASS -- Armenia is expressing 
regret over the fact that the Iranian Foreign Ministry came up 
with a statement concerning the crash of the Iranian plane 
before the end of the work and the drawing of a final conclusion 
by a special commission of Iran and CIS, which investigated the 
circumstances of the accident, acting press secretary of the 
Armenian president Levon Zurabyan stated today. The statement 
of the Armenian side came two days after the statement of the 
Iranian Foreign Ministry, which said that the Iranian plane had 
been brought down on March 17 by a missile, fired by the 
Armenian troops deployed in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  According to the Armenian Foreign Ministry, circulated on 
the next day after the accident, the Iranian military-transport 
plane, which was flying from Moscow to Tehran, deviated from his 
course by about 100 km, instead of entering Armenia's air space. 
After that it found itself in the air space of 
Nagorno-Karabakh, where it crashed near Stepanakert. According 
to the preliminary information of the Armenian side, something 
went wrong with the mechanisms of the plane, which was denied, 
however, by experts from the Foreign Ministry, civil aviation 
and the air force of Iran, who visited Stepanakert. All the 32 
Iranian citizens, who were on board the plane, including women 
and children, died. After official honours in Yerevan, their 
remains were sent to Tehran.

<F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Aydinyan: "Tragedy Near Karabakh -- It </F>
Was All Far More Complicated..."] 
  [Text] Yerevan -- The remains of 32 Iranian citizens have 
been flown out of Yerevan to Tehran. They had been taken to 
Yerevan from Stepanakert, near which an Iranian C-30 [as 
published] military transport went down. There was a funeral 
ceremony at the airport attended by Armenian Vice President 
Gagik Arutyunyan and other ranking republic leaders. Akhmad 
Sobkhani [name as transliterated], Iranian charge d'affaires in 
Armenia, expressed gratitude for the sincere condolences. The 
Armenian side, he said, had proved its good-neighborly relations 
in practice by actively participating in the investigation into 
the causes of the crash. 
  Nonetheless, it would be premature to believe that all the 
ramifications of the incident have been exhausted. As an 
Armenian Foreign Ministry representative said in a brief 
conversation with journalists, "it was all far more complicated 
than we might have thought." 
  A special commission including experts from Iran, the 
Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Armenia is still at work in 
Stepanakert. It is too soon to talk of results, but certain 
statements by the head of the Iranian experts have sounded a 
warning. He claimed that the aircraft exploded before coming 
down, and that it had not malfunctioned. Journalists have not 
discovered on what this assertion is based. If the aircraft was 
indeed in proper working order, how could it have been as much 
as 100 km off course? And why did the aircraft remain at an 
altitude of 7.5 km for 20-25 minutes over Azerbaijan, but then 
descend to 3.5 km over the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic? How could 
the crew have failed to respond to the calls from the air 
traffic controllers who noticed the course deviation? For his 
part, Akhmat [as published] Sobkhani rejected the theory that it 
was an intelligence-gathering flight. The aircraft did not have 
the necessary equipment for this. 
  Another point is worrying -- in the opinion of certain 
observers, Iran is inclined to consider Armenia chiefly 
responsible [glavnym otvetstvennym zvenom], even though the 
aircraft was not overflying its territory. It is to be hoped 
that the experts will be able to unravel the true cause of the 
crash and that this tragic incident will not overshadow 
Armenian-Iranian relations, which are developing actively.

Executive Branch, in the shape of one person, will elected 23 
June -- this decision has been adopted by the Republic Supreme 
Soviet. 
  Political parties and movements have already decided on 
their

include former parliamentary speaker S. Shushkevich; the 
Communists have named V. Novikov, secretary of the Party of 
Communists of Belarus Central Committee and cochairman of the 
People's Movement of Belorussia [PMB]; and the "Belaya Rus" Slav 
Council has named Supreme Soviet Deputy A. Lukashenko. 
  At a routine sitting of the Coordinating Committee of the 
PMB 
-- the largest sociopolitical association, which includes 27 
parties and organizations -- it was decided to assist the action 
group collecting signatures in support of Vasiliy Novikov. At 
the same time the PMB deputies' association in the Supreme 
Soviet has been instructed to organize the collection of 
signatures among the deputies to put forward V. Kebich, chairman 
of the Belorusian Council of Ministers, as a presidential 
candidate. The final decision on PMB support for a single 
candidate will be made at the Second PMB Congress.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivan Vasilevich: "Presidential Marathon Has </F>
Begun"] 
  [Text] The Belarusian Party of Communists [PKB], which 
until recently opposed the introduction of a presidency in the 
Republic, will participate in the presidential elections. This 
decision was adopted at the plenum of the Central Committee 
convened to discuss the new political situation, which developed 
after the Supreme Soviet passed a corresponding law. PKB 
members nominated Vasil Novikaw, secretary of the PKB Central 
Committee, as their candidate for president. 
  Assessing this fact, numerous experts and observers notice 
that the left and left-centrist forces composing the People's 
Movement of Belarus, have probably not agreed on a single 
candidate for the job of Belarus' first president. At the same 
time, the opposite wing presents only one candidate for this 
post -- Stanislav Shushkevich. He was proposed by the Belarusian 
Social Democratic Assembly. The Belarusian Union of 
Entrepreneurs did not remain aloof and proposed its president, 
Vladimir Karyagin, to participate in the presidential race. 
However, in the immediate future, everything could change and 
it is not ruled out that we will learn about other -- left, 
right, centrist, independent, and, by all means, unexpected -- 
candidates.

Front [BNF] decided to nominate Zyanon Paznyak as its 
presidential candidate. At a press conference on the same day, 
BNF representative Syarhey Navumchik said that signatures in 
favor of Z. Paznyak will be collected among Supreme Soviet 
deputies and Belarusian citizens. In the words of S. Navumchik, 
while one should not count on support from the deputies, the 
signature drive among citizens might bring very good results. 
According to S. Navumchik, activists from the Free Trade Union 
are conducting a survey among workers at several enterprises to 
single out the most popular presidential candidates. Initial 
results are as follows: of 800 workers at the Minsk Tractor 
Plant, only one person each spoke in favor of Stanislav 
Shushkevich and Alyaksandr Lukashenka, while the other 798 
respondents expressed support for Zyanon Paznyak.

  [Text] On 30 March, Syarhey Navumchyk, member of the 
Belarusian Popular Front opposition in the Supreme Soviet, held 
a news conference at which he briefed journalists on the course 
of today's session held behind closed doors. In particular, he 
told them of a speech delivered by Belarusian National Bank 
Chairman Stanislav Bahdankevich, who told deputies that "we have 
almost matured to the point of taking new steps to reform the 
economy." Syarhey Navumchyk speculated that the majority in 
parliament is ready to "fire" Bahdankevich, because the latter 
has recently begun to show a more and more skeptical attitude 
toward Belarus' joining the common ruble zone. 
  According to Syarhey Navumchyk, at the behind-closed-doors 
session, also discussed was the issue of appointing Anatol 
Butevich chief of the recently established Ministry of Culture 
and Press, and Alyaksandr Stalyarov as chairman of the Committee 
for Radio and Television Broadcasting, which will be established 
in place of the State Broadcasting Company. Although both 
candidacies have been put forward by Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich, they are subject to approval by the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium and appropriate committees. Syarhey Navumchyk, as a 
member of the Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human 
Rights, stated that it is very unlikely that his committee will 
support the candidacy of Alyaksandr Stalyarov. According to 
Syarhey Navumchyk, Alyaksandr Stalyarov has warned him in a 
private conversation that if members of the committee do not 
vote for him, he will "cut off the oxygen to the opposition and 
all democrats," because he is convinced that the Supreme Soviet 
Presidium will support him. Nevertheless, Syarhey Navumchyk 
said, even if Stalyarov is appointed by the Supreme Soviet, the 
Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human Rights will have 
the right to veto this decision, and it is going to do so. 
  Syarhey Navumchyk also pointed out that the presidential 
campaign has already begun, and that the mass media are being 
concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers, the 
leader of which is gathering "faithful people" around himself.

  [Text] On 30 March, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, head of the 
legislative anticorruption commission, delivered a report at the 
evening sitting of the 13th Belarusian Supreme Soviet session in 
Minsk. He said that his commission has demanded the resignation 
of Deputy Prime Ministers Mikalay Kostsikaw and Stanislaw Bryl; 
Uladzimir Radkevich, head of the State Committee for Foreign 
Economic Relations; chairman of the Board of the Belarusian 
National Bank [Stanislaw Bahdankevich]; and Defense Minister 
Pavel Kazlowski. However, A. Lukashenka did not present 
specific facts, except in the case of Deputy Prime Minister 
Stanislav Bryl. According to Lukashenka, S. Bryl pulled some 
strings so that his son could receive a plot of land on which to 
build a house. Deputy Prime Minister Mikalay Kostsikaw was one 
of the people on Lukashenka's list that took advantage of 
services rendered by the governments's renovation and 
construction administration, and failed to pay the entire amount 
of money charged by the administration. In addition, A. 
Lukashenka said that his commission sent a letter to Belarusian 
Prosecutor General Vasiliy Shaladonov with the request to see 
that individuals mentioned earlier in the commission's report be 
persecuted. There are 54 officials, including Foreign Minister 
Pyotr Krawchanka, named in the report.

  [Excerpt] At its 30 March closed session, the Supreme 
Soviet did not pass any resolution regarding the main directions 
of the monetary-credit policy in 1994. National Bank Chairman 
Stanislaw Bahdankevich pointed out at a news conference that the 
National Bank and the Council of Ministers had drafted a joint 
resolution suggesting that the main directions of the 
monetary-credit policy be adopted; the National Bank's payment 
bill be proclaimed the only legal tender on Belarusian territory 
for the period preceding the final merging of the Russian and 
Belarusian monetary systems; the National Bank's motion on 
commercial banks be confirmed. The motion envisions that 
commercial banks earmark at least 13 percent of their credit 
capital for the implementation of promising investment projects. 
  However, this draft along with other proposals by some 
people's deputies was rejected by the Supreme Soviet.[passage 
omitted]

  [Text] In connection with the Supreme Soviet resolution 
regarding the issuance of personal privatization vouchers as of 
1 April 1994, the Republican Council of the Movement for 
Democracy, Social Progress, and Justice [DSPS] has addressed 
workers, peasants, and the working intelligentsia with an appeal 
to join the DSPS and resolutely demand that the state's economic 
course be altered. According to the appeal, the actual aim of 
personal vouchers is "to strip us of national property and of 
such social guarantees as the right to work, rest, happy 
childhood, adequate care in old age, free medical care, and 
housing." 
  The authors of the document believe that the project of 
issuing vouchers is "the final stage of transforming the 
socialist socioeconomic system into a capitalist one, which 
entails such inevitable consequences for working people as 
poverty, absence of rights, unemployment and diseases, 
humiliation, and the tragedy of colonial dependence." 
  The DSPS Republican Council calls upon the Belarusian 
Supreme 
Soviet to reject privatization and offers another way to 
overcome the crisis. In particular, it suggests that DSPS 
candidates be elected to the legislature and local soviets; and 
that the constitution adopted against people's will, be 
rescinded.

Migration of Russian-Speaking Population"] 
  [Text] Rumors circulating about the migration from 
Moldavia [Moldova] of the Russian-speaking population have no 
real basis, Republic President Mircea Snegur stated. He 
described them as tendentious. Meeting on Monday [28 March] 
with leaders of Tarakliyskiy Rayon, where there is a concentated 
population of Bulgarians, M. Snegur also touched on the 
certification of the population in the knowledge of the state 
language, scheduled for 2 April. In his opinion, the timetable 
for this should be finally examined by the new parliament. 
  At the same time, the president believes that the necessary 
conditions should be created for study of the state language, 
and that the state is seeing to this. M. Snegur remarked that 
knowledge of the state language for people occupying leading 
posts is obligatory.

  [Text] Today, in Simferopol, Crimean President Yuriy 
Meshkov is to hold a news conference for journalists on the 
results of the plebiscite. Its results were determined last 
night. The first question was: Are you in favor of renewing the 
provision in the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea dated 6 
May 1992, which defines the regulation of relations between the 
Republic of Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of agreements and 
treaties? This question was answered in the affirmative by 78.4 
percent of the people. Dual citizenship was backed by 82.8 
percent of those polled. Around 80 percent of Crimea's 
population believe that the Crimean president's directives on 
the issues, that are temporarily not settled by the Republic of 
Crimea's legislation, should be granted the status of laws. 
  Over 1 million Crimeans took part in the plebiscite.

<F P=106> [Interview with Myroslav Popovych, member of the Ukrainian </F>
Academy of Sciences, by Pol Mathil in Kiev; date not given: "On 
the elections in Ukraine"] 
  [Text] [Mathil] Contrary to all forecasts, 75 percent of 
Ukrainian voters went to the polls. Is that a surprise? 
  [Popovych] I am surprised. It is further evidence that 
sociology is not an exact science. 
  [Mathil] Were the Ukrainians not said to be disappointed and 
apathetic? 
  [Popovych] Disappointed yes, but not apathetic. The 
Ukrainians seemed to be absent from public life because they did 
not identify with the existing government. Logically, they went 
to the polls to express that rejection. There was a surprising 
resurgence in the last two or three weeks. 
  [Mathil] What was the reason for this resurgence? 
  [Popovych] It is mainly what I call the "Canary Islands 
phenomenon." Dmytro Poyizd, a vulgar and populist leader, found 
an audience for his slogans which were very hostile to the whole 
political class: "We will find all these profiteers and 
traitors," he said, "even if they hide in the Canaries," a 
symbol of opulence in his eyes. For some people that was 
enough. He was elected in the first round. 
  [Mathil] And who will vote in the second round? Do you have 
any forecast to make for the future Parliament? 
  [Popovych] No. Only 49 deputies were elected in the first 
round, in other words there are still 802 candidates in the 
second round. Our electoral Commission was not capable of 
telling us, 48 hours after the election, who will run against 
whom in these 401 duels. That being so, my forecast is as 
imprecise as it is pessimistic. 
  In short, the Parliament will not bring about many changes. 
Our democracy is very young, the political parties are very 
weak, and the politicians are not very mature, some are already 
corrupt. The government has neutralized some of its opponents, 
in particular by distributing apartments to deputies in the 
capital's fashionable districts. That area is called "Tsarskoye 
Selo [as published]," a reference to the residence of the czars 
near St. Petersburg. Our electoral law is harmful, it has 
really liquidated the political parties. Honest candidates 
could not withstand the assault of populist, nationalist, or 
communist propaganda. 
  [Mathil] So who will govern this country? 
  [Popovych] In general, the same people, those who are called 
"the government party" in our country. 
  [Mathil] What about the presidency? 
  [Popovych] Exit Leonid Kravchuk. His career is over. Enter 
Leonid Kuchma. It is he who will be president of Ukraine after 
the elections on 26 June. 
  [Mathil] What will he do? 
  [Popovych] Nobody knows. Not even him. But it is he, the 
former boss of "Yuzmash [as published]," the biggest missile 
factory in the world, and former prime minister who, if he keeps 
his promises, will perhaps implement a series of reforms, which 
Kravchuk has been incapable of doing. 
  [Mathil] The West will miss Kravchuk... 
  [Popovych] Yes, he has merits. He did not understand 
anything about economic affairs, but he created Ukraine's image 
abroad. He was able to avert the specter of Russian occupation. 
There are of course problems like the Crimea or the Black Sea 
fleet, but in short, he has removed the "Serbo-Croat prospect" 
from Ukraine. 
  [Mathil] Permanently? 
  [Popovych] Nothing is permanent. Russia will try to gain the 
right to examine all of Ukraine's strategic decisions. Of 
course, we would like to be closer to Poland, in other words to 
Europe; we have made various proposals, but, as you know, Warsaw 
is not very welcoming. There is the shadow of Moscow... 
  [Mathil] Would you be prepared to give up half of the Black 
Sea fleet? 
  [Popovych] I am prepared to give up the whole fleet. The 
problem is that that will never end. After the fleet there will 
be Crimea, then Donetsk, and so forth. Without Ukraine, there 
is no Russian empire. However, in Moscow people are dreaming 
more and more of a new empire. 
  [Mathil] Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has said that he 
will request the aid of the Black Sea fleet to achieve his 
separatist dreams... 
  [Popovych] Meshkov is a dangerous imbecile. In comparison 
with Meshkov, Zhirinovskiy is a pillar of lucidity. 
  [Mathil] What can the West do? 
  [Popovych] The West does not understand anything about what 
is happening in our country. It has the Kravchuk complex, like 
it had the Gorbachev or Yeltsin complex. 
  [Mathil] What does that mean in practice? 
  [Popovych] In practice, our elite is virtually banned from 
radio and television. Why not help it to break Kravchuk's 
monopoly over radio and television? And then, we must be 
guaranteed that specific economic aid will accompany our 
reforms. If and when there are reforms... 
  [Mathil] Meanwhile? 
  [Popovych] Today, policy toward Ukraine is still only 
defined 
in accordance with policy toward Russia. That is beginning to 
change. Nothing specific, but we can see that the West is 
thinking... 
  [Mathil] You are so critical of all the others. Do you, the 
former president of "Rukh,[Ukrainian Popular Movement -- UPM]" 
have your own political ambitions? 
  [Popovych] Oh, no. I was president because a president was 
needed, but there are enough amateurs in our political class. 
  [Mathil] You have a very black view of everything... 
  [Popovych] And how are we living here? Do things look 
bright?

<F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol 30 Mar, TASS -- The Crimean authorities 
"have no intention of whipping up confrontation" caused by 
Kiev's negative reaction to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's 
decision banning recruiting offices to send conscripts outside 
the Crimea this spring, a presidential aide said. 
  Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told 
ITAR-TASS 
on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top 
military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out 
disagreements and work out a compromise. 
  The most probable solution would be to leave half of 3,400 
draftees in the Crimea and send 20 per cent (about 680 people) 
to the Ukrainian Army and 1,000 (about 30 per cent) to the Black 
Sea Fleet, he said. 
  Kuznetsov said the other half will be sent to adjacent 
Ukrainian regions for military training since the Crimea does 
not have enough training facilities and expressed the hope that 
30 to 40 per cent of them will return to the Republic upon the 
completion of studying. 
  Speaking about the autumn drafting campaign, Kuznetsov said 
that "we hope all prerequisites and conditions will be created 
for military service in the Crimea."

<F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Sevastopol by </F>
Ye. Orobtsova and A. Lomakin] 
  [Text] [Orobtsova] The Black Sea Fleet remains a bone of 
contention between Ukraine and Russia. Vladimir Bezkorovannyy, 
commander of the Ukrainian Naval Forces, believes that the naval 
vessels of the Black Sea Fleet's coastal service should be 
divided equally between Russia and Ukraine. However, in the 
opinion of Valeriy Kuznetsov, the Crimean president's military 
adviser, Ukraine is not capable of financing combat training 
even with the minimal number of ships at its disposal. The 
Black Sea Fleet numbers more than 100 naval vessels in all, only 
five of which are Ukrainian. Meanwhile, as Valeriy Kuznetsov 
stressed, Ukraine has considerably increased the number of its 
ground forces on Crimean territory, where there are now around 
50,000 Ukrainain servicemen together with their construction 
units. Ukraine is probably afraid of the processes that are 
taking place in Crimea, Valeriy Kuznetsov said, because Crimea 
is Russian in spirit.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy </F>
by Georgiy Chernomorskiy; place and date not given: "Ukraine 
Will Live Up to Its Commitments"] 
  [Text] [Chernomorskiy] Many of our citizens are surely 
concerned about the implementation of the trilateral agreement 
signed by the Ukrainian, U.S., and Russian presidents to bring 
nuclear weapons out of Ukraine. What can you say about this? 
  [Radetskyy] A total of 2,000 combat units are subject to 
removal. The first train with 60 combat units left Ukraine for 
its destination site on 4 March. One could ask, why only 60? 
Just because this is a technically founded norm. The next 
trainload was due to leave for Russia on 9 March. This did not 
happen, though; and it was not the fault of Ukraine. The point 
is that there was an information leak in the Russian press that 
revealed the departure date. Can you imagine what could have 
happened if some lunatic, or a group of people, had decided to 
follow the example of Herostratus [who burned a famous Greek 
temple to become famous]? 
  I believe that it would be better if journalists stuck to 
the 
Hippocratic principle of "do not harm." As for the next 
shipment, it did leave Ukraine, but not before we made sure that 
all precautionary measure were taken along its route. Ukraine 
has always had a serious attitude toward its commitments. 
  [Chernomorskiy] The press has recently published a lot of 
articles about the excessive number of generals in the Ukrainian 
Army. They say that Ukraine has more generals than all of the 
NATO countries combined. 
  [Radetskyy] The Ukrainian Army, numbering more than half a 
million servicemen, has 260 generals. So, in this respect, it 
is not all that different from other Armed Forces in Europe. 
But this issue did not appear out of nowhere -- Ukraine does 
have many generals. The point is that they are attached to 
different ministries and committees, and have nothing to do with 
the Army. Plus, 260 is not a final figure. Under certain 
conditions, it could be revised and reduced. These conditions, 
however, do not exist at present. 
  The Academy of Ukrainian Armed Forces will become 
operational 
on 1 September. Beside Ukrainian officers, it will accept 
foreign and CIS officers for study. As it will need experienced 
scholars, generals with vast expertise will surely be invited to 
teach at this institution. 
  [Chernomorskiy] A lot of speculation was raised by the 
statement of Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, commander in 
chief of the Ukrainian Navy, when he said our country has no 
intention of selling its share of the Black Sea Fleet. At the 
same time, Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense minister, 
insists that the agreements made in Massandra be honored. 
  [Radetskyy] There was no Massandra agreement as such, to 
begin with. Only an agreement on intentions was signed. I 
believe that these intentions will be implemented only by mutual 
agreement of the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, who are also 
commanders in chief of their Armed Forces. They are empowered 
to make a final decision. In any case, we should clearly define 
what is subject to division or sale. This is why on 15 March, 
we began an inventory of the Black Sea Fleet assets as of 
December 1991, after which Russia and Ukraine are to determine 
to what degree the fleet should be scaled down. In the end, the 
final course of action is to be made during the third stage. In 
any case, Ukraine will not be left without the fleet. Even 
today, the Ukrainian Navy includes five combat ships, and there 
are still new ships under construction at Ukrainian shipyards! 
  [Chernomorskiy] What is the situation in the Air Force? 
According to evidence gathered by our newspaper, 300 pilots 
have applied for discharges; because of fuel shortages, they 
rarely get the chance to fly, losing their skills. The 19 
unique TU-160 aircraft, costing $250 million a piece, are also 
sitting idle on the ground. Their maintenance must be quite 
expensive, I presume. Maybe we should sell them? 
  [Radetskyy] Your paper's evidence is, to put it mildly, 
overstated. There were no more than 100 pilots who requested 
discharges. These were primarily officers whose length of 
service makes them eligible for retirement. Some want to change 
their citizenship and move to another CIS country for permanent 
residence. This is a natural process. At the same time, I admit 
that there are reasons for concern. Depending on the type of 
aircraft, the standard annual flight time for U.S., German, or 
Dutch pilots is 160-180 hours. This norm was a little lower in 
the former Soviet Air Force. In Ukraine, it is 25-40 hours in 
most Air Force units. Of course, the pilots did not fold their 
wings. They fully exploit training facilities, which 
unfortunately, cannot substitute for real flying. 
  Now, about the TU-160's, as Ukrainian airspace is too small, 
our strategy does not envision employing these planes. I 
personally believe that these planes can be sold -- not for 
money, though. The dollars or rubles that we would receive for 
them could get past the Defense Ministry, disappearing in 
different channels. We would be better off if the other party 
would pay with components for combat and army aviation vehicles, 
fuel, or diesel fuel for housing construction. Of course, it is 
up to the government and president whether or not those planes 
need to be sold. 
  [Chernomorskiy] You mentioned housing construction. How many 
servicemen are without a place to live? How is this problem 
being tackled? 
  [Radetskyy] As of 1 March 1994, there were 78,236 officers 
and warrant officers in the Ukrainian Armed Forces without 
housing. According to a state program, the Defense Ministry will 
receive between 24,000 and 28,000 apartments annually. 
Unfortunately, the state is not in a position to implement this 
program right now. Last year, we were given only 14,000 
apartments in spite of the active engagement of several foreign 
companies in the housing projects. Things will hardly improve 
over the next two years. I would like to note, however, that a 
great deal depends not only on the state budget, but on the 
attitude of local authorities as well. For example, 
Dniepropetrovsk, Ivano-Frankovsk, Lvov, and Chernigov Oblasts 
cope with the problem of housing for the military much better 
than other regions. 
  [Chernomorskiy] What are your impressions from your recent 
trip to the United States? 
  [Radetskyy] I was part of the president's team and, at the 
same time, a guest of newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry. I was quite impressed with my visit to the 
Pentagon, but it was not over its size or number of hallways. I 
was stunned by the atmosphere of openness. You know, I am not 
20 years old and can tell real candor from phony. All my 
questions were comprehensively answered. They saw a partner in 
me, not a potential adversary. 
  I also had a chance to visit West Point, the oldest military 
academy in the United States. Our readers would be curious to 
know that this military institution recently began to admit 
women. Representatives of the fairer sex account for 12 percent 
of all cadets at the academy; beautiful, but not weak. I myself 
saw young women do 50 and more push-ups. U.S. servicemen have 
an almost fanatical attitude toward sports. One could think 
they want to restore the traditions of ancient Sparta. West 
Point cadets are the elite of the U.S. Armed Forces. I am very 
pleased that the U.S. defense secretary and I reached an 
agreement on sending a group of our boys to study there. 
  Finishing on the topic of military educational, I must admit 
that serious blunders were made while reforming our system of 
military education. Incidentally, this issue was brought up in 
parliament by deputies of different orientations. I believe 
that the Defense Ministry conducted too passive a policy in this 
sphere, and did very little to turn our academies into forges 
turning out officers for CIS and other countries. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has recently paid a 
return visit to Kiev. The Americans were pleased with its 
results, and expressed their hope that contacts between our two 
ministries will continue to expand and strengthen.

  [Text] The first law which the new parliament should adopt 
is a law on taxation. This statement was made in an interview 
with Interfax-Ukraine, by the co-chairman of the inter-regional 
bloc of reforms, Leonid Kuchma. 
  He was elected on March 27 to be people's deputy of Ukraine, 
winning in his constituency 91 percent of the votes. 
  Kuchma believes that the legal basis was virtually destroyed 
in economics. He criticized the activities of the government 
which in December 1993 freed prices and restricted credits. 
According to the former prime minister, this has caused the 
debt crisis and the stoppage of enterprises. 
  He still believes that the president should be the head of 
the executive power. He disagrees that the heads of the local 
councils be granted executive powers. 
  "On this I agree with Kravchuk. If so, we will really have 
26 presidents in 26 regions," said Kuchma. 
  He spoke against rescheduling the presidential elections for 
a later date. There are no grounds for that, he said. 
  Speaking about the problem of relations between the Crimea 
and Ukraine, Kuchma said that pressure on Crimea will produce no 
results. 
  Crimea should be a starting point for reforms in Ukraine, 
said Kuchma.

  [Text] Kiev 30 Mar, TASS--The Crimea could act broadly and 
freely in the economic sphere as envisaged by the law on the 
delineation of powers between Ukraine and the Crimea, Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk said on Wednesday. The statement 
followed his talks with Crimean Vice-President Yevgeniy Saburov 
on Tuesday. 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Kravchuk said that in all 
other spheres, especially in the political one, the sides 
"should coordinate their moves and activities, taking into 
account the interests of Ukraine and the people of the Crimea 
and international principles, especially those concerning 
territorial integrity, the sovereignty of states and their 
borders." 
  These are the most acute problems, he added. "We need to 
agree on the status quo and refrain from any pressure," the 
Ukrainian leader continued, adding that "playing the `Crimean' 
card will do no good either to the Crimea, Ukraine or Russia," 
he said. 
  Lately Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov has come up with a 
proposal to Ukraine to withdraw its troops from the Crimea and 
ordered military enlistment offices not to send conscripts 
outside the Crimea this spring. 
  Valeriy Kuznetsov, Meshkov's military adviser, told 
ITAR-TASS 
on Wednesday that consultations are now underway with a top 
military commander from the Odessa military district to iron out

Sea Fleet, he said.

  [Text] There can be no question of resuming nuclear tests 
at the Semipalatinsk test site, Kazakh leader Nursultan 
Nazarbayev told Russian mass media leaders in Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
  He said as many as 526 aerial, surface and underground 
nuclear blasts had been carried out in eastern Kazakhstan in the 
past 40 years. An estimated 500,000 people fell victim to the 
tests and serious environmental damage was caused. 
  "Kazakhstan has so far been left alone to face those 
problems. The Russian president and I discussed this at length 
and I can now say with confidence that Russia will help us in 
utilizing that large scientific complex for peaceful purposes. 
For example, the Semipalatinsk site can be used for testing 
safety systems of the nuclear power plants or as a space 
training center in concert with Baikonur," Nazarbayev said. 
  At the same time, he called for an international commission 
to be set up, Russia included, to assess the volume and nature 
of damage caused to the people and environment. "This can at 
least help set priorities in eliminating the harmful effects 
from testing," Nazarbayev said.

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Krasulin: "Nursultan Nazarbayev: We </F>
Shall Be Together"] 
  [Text] "Having signed the package of Kazakhstan-Russian 
documents on Monday we laid a foundation for our two states to 
enter the 21st century together. And that accords with our 
peoples' aspirations," stated Kazakhstan President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev at a meeting with Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov in which 
representatives of business circles and the intelligentsia took 
part. 
  This meeting was a kind of summing up of the results of the 
Kazakhstan leader's first official visit to Russia. Nursultan 
Nazarbayev shared with those present his thoughts about the 
situation in Kazakhstan and Russia and the prospects for the 
development of bilateral relations. In particular he noted that 
he does not agree with the model of the reforms which have been 
implemented in Russia. Privatization from below has not 
succeeded and "has merely led to chaos" so Kazakhstan has 
decided to create state holding companies. In agriculture they 
have rejected the privatization of land and allowed its leasing 
for a period of 99 years with the right of inheritance. 
Kazakhstan has taken the path of retaining strong collective 
and state farms but on new terms. Here those who want to can 
always leave and start their own business when they have 
received their share. 
  The president dwelled in detail on the nationalities 
problem. 
He said that it has arisen as a result of the collapse of "one 
state in which we all lived." Then Kazakhstan "was pushed out 
of the ruble zone" and that merely created additional 
difficulties for people. "If there was the certainty that dual 
citizenship would make it possible to resolve the problem, we 
would introduce it. But in this case the problem would still 
remain at the daily routine level." 
  Nursultan Nazarbayev stated that as president of a sovereign 
state he cannot accept the formation that is the CIS. Of the 
270 documents adopted by the CIS one of its members has approved 
40, another 140, another 150. By creating independent states 
all former republics of the USSR hoped that they would sell 
their goods to Europe and receive dollars in exchange. But it 
has turned out that we had a common market and our goods were 
only necessary to us. "The time has come for a tougher 
association," he said. A Eurasian Union based on principles 
completely distinct from the present community could be such an 
association, the president said.

certain agreement has been reached. Negotiations are still 
continuing (by 1345).

  [Text] Tbilisi 31 Mar, TASS -- A big group of policemen 
headed by Chief Police Officer of Tbilisi, Major General David 
Zeikidze attempted on Thursday to break into the assembly hall 
of the Georgian Parliament to protest against the planned 
appointment of Shota Kviraya as the new interior minister. 
  The policemen managed to get into the buidling and it was 
Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze who came out to talk to them. 
  They said that Kviraya is an "unworthy and incompetent man 
suspected of corruption and mafia links". 
  Shevardnadze succeeded to bring the passions down and 
explained to Zeikidze and his policemen that their behaviour was 
incorrect. The group left the building after that. 
  Kviraya was appointed the interior minister by the 
parliament.

Abkhazia's Kodor Ravine. 
  With reference to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry, an 
Abkhazian spokesman told INTERFAX that fighting continued from 
24 March to 26 March, during which Abkhazians occupied the 
village of Lata, the Georgian stronghold in this region. 
  He said, however, that individual clashes were not ruled 
out. 
  He rejected Georgian sources' assertions that 60 Abkhazian 
soldiers were killed on 29 March. Two Abkhazians have been 
killed since fighting began, he said.

  [Text] Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian 
parliament, held a conference in Sukhumi on 30 March to report 
on the operation to eliminate Georgian saboteur groups active in 
the Kodor canyon, the parliament's press service reported. The 
conference was attended by Abkhazian Deputy Prime Minister 
Vladimir Mikanba and top officials of the Defense and Interior 
Ministries and the security service. 
  An attack by Georgian gangs was said to have been beaten 
back 
and several armored vehicles and small arms and a large amount 
of ammunition captured. The village of Lata, Gulripsh District, 
was liberated. 
  The press service also reported that remains had been found 
of passengers of a helicopter that had flown on a humanitarian 
mission from the besieged town of Tkvarcheli to Gudauta when it 
had been shot down by the Georgians in the vicinity of Lata on 
14 December 1992. 
  According to Abkhazian Deputy Defense Minister Nikolay 
Jonua, 
"the situation in the Kodor canyon has stabilized and no

remnants of Georgian units that have escaped up the Kodor 
canyon."

  [Text] Moscow 30 Mar, TASS -- The situation in the Kodor 
gorge has stabilised. No major fighting was reported. Only 
sporadic gun fire breaks out occasionally between Georgian units 
staying in the upper part of the gorge, Nikolay Dzhonua, 
Abkhazian deputy defence minister, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday. 
  The press service of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet said that 
the operation to block and drive Georgian subversive groups out 
of the Kodor gorge has been completed. 
  The press service said that the situation along the Inguri 
river remains tense. The Georgian side continues shelling 
Abkhazian villages and sending out subversive groups to 
Abkhazia. Despite this, life in the Gali District is returning 
back to normal. About 30,000 refugees have returned to the 
district, the local tea packing factory will reopen soon. 
Electricity supplies have been resumed. There is still a 
shortage of medics and medicines. 
  Meanwhile, Georgian sources assess the events in the Kodor 
gorge as Abkhazia's attempt to prepare for receiving a 
reinforcement from north Caucasian republics this summer. The 
Georgian Defence Ministry said that the road passing through the 
gorge is the safest route for Abkhazian troops and helicopters 
as mountains cover them from Georgian guns. It also said that 
Abkhazian troops continue shelling villages lying high in the 
mountains.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- The second round of 
free-trade talks between Estonia and the European Union [EU] got 
down to discussion of concrete questions, head of the Estonian 
delegation at the talks, Foreign Ministry Deputy Chancellor 
Priit Kolbre said at a press conference today. 
  The delegations discussed in Brussels the preambula to the 
agreement, general principles of the agreement, trade in 
textiles, agricultural issues and competition policies, Kolbre 
said. 
  The preambula details the content of the agreement and 
states 
its ultimate objective: Estonia's membership in the European 
Union. 
  Under the general principles, the free-trade area as well as 
trade in manufactured goods free of quotas and customs duties 
are defined. Quotas or tariffs on industrial goods in 
accordance with the principles of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade may be established with a separate protocol. 
  A free-trade regime, but with some restrictions, will be 
established also in the textiles trade. Signe Ratso, a 
specialist from the Economics Ministry international trade 
department and a member of the Estonian delegation, said the 
European Union will not introduce quotas and tariffs on import 
from Estonia, but reserves the right to establish them as and 
when needed. Ratso said the European Union fears most transit 
trade through Estonia and reexport. 
  Agricultural issues working groups approach the talks on a 
product-by-product basis. "In the next rounds we plan to put up 
a fight for more favorable tariffs and quotas for each 
individual farming product," Agriculture Ministry Deputy 
Chancellor Ruve Sank said. 
  The Estonian delegation familiarized its negotiation 
partners 
with the Estonian competition law, which the EU delegation 
regarded in a positive light, said Imbi Markus, a specialist 
from the Justice Ministry international law department. The two 
parties agreed that Estonia will have to bring its legislation 
into line with European standards. 
  The customs working groups discussed rules of origin and 
international cooperation. Both documents are standard and pose 
no problems, claimed Jaanus Raud from the Customs Department, so 
they will probably be initialed during the next round of talks. 
  Estonia will under the agreement be allowed to introduce 
customs restrictions to protect its domestic market, but they 
must not exceed those of the European Union. 
  The third official round of negotiations was scheduled to 
begin April 27 in Brussels, with an unofficial meeting to take 
place April 12-13 in Tallinn.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- Estonia was the last of the 
Baltic states to conclude a framework agreement on defense 
cooperation with Denmark. 
  Danish Defense Minister Hans Haekkerup and his Estonian 
counterpart Indrek Kannik signed the treaty today. 
  The framework agreement outlines the principles of 
cooperation between the Estonian and the Danish Defense 
Ministries and military structures as well as the relations 
between military and civilian authorities, foresees 
establishment of civilian control over military structures, and 
provides for exchange of information and consultations on 
peacekeeping issues and military budgeting, as well as for 
environmental cooperation to eliminate damage to nature caused 
by the military. The agreement allows the two countries to 
conclude additional bilateral agreements on military cooperation. 
  Kannik noted at the press conference after the signing that 
this is Estonia's first treaty on defense cooperation. 
  The Danish defense minister stated that his country attaches 
great importance to the treaty in the hope that it "becomes a 
vital step on Estonia's road to NATO membership." 
  Haekkerup met during his visit with Prime Minister Mart 
Laar, 
Kannik, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Parliament Speaker Ulo 
Nugis, and members of the parliamentary National Defense 
Commission. 
  The meetings covered a wide range of issues including the 
development of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and Denmark's 
assistance in it, as well as Estonian-Russian relations and the 
situation in Europe. 
  Haekkerup said at the press conference that the matter at 
issue at present is, not the threat of Russia's military 
aggression, but its political power. "We stick to our position 
that Russian troops must leave Estonia," the Danish defense 
minister said. "Their presence in Kaliningrad is another matter, 
since that territory belongs to the sovereign Russia, although I 
think Russia has at present more troops stationed there than 
necessary for the defense of the region." 
  Kannik said the Danish defense minister affirmed his 
negative 
attitude toward Russia's concept of the "near abroad" and 
whatever division of spheres of influence in Europe. 
  "Denmark has done its utmost for Estonia, and Estonia is 
very 
grateful to Denmark for its support," the Estonian defense 
minister said. 
  Haekkerup yesterday presented the Estonian Defense Forces 
with an inspection cutter donated by the Danish Royal Navy. 
  Today, the Danish defense minister delivered a speech on the 
subject of "Denmark, Estonia and European security" at the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  Haekkerup leaves Estonia in the afternoon.

  [Text] Tallinn, 31 Mar -- Estonia is not obliged to follow 
the Latvian example in the issue of retired Russian servicemen, 
said Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik speaking to local 
television on 30 March. "Estonia has no intention of engaging 
in any compromise in the issue of granting social protection to 
Russian military pensioners residing in the republic," he said, 
adding that he had no information about any kind of Western 
pressure on Estonia over this issue. He said that the 
guarantees to retired Russian servicemen were the price that 
Latvia had been forced to pay for the treaty on troops pullout. 
  As we know, the absence of an agreement on military 
pensioners is a major impediment to signing the act on final 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. 
  Assessing the prospects of the upcoming new round of 
Russian-Estonian talks on 5-6 April, Luik said he expected that 
the agreement on withdrawing foreign troops from the Estonian 
territory would be initialled. He said that the Estonian side 
had already been prepared for this a month ago. He added he 
also hoped that Russia would provide a written "schedule of 
troops pull-out promised long ago."

Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations Vasiliy Svirin told 
ETA, on Wednesday [30 March], that the Russian side had "done 
serious work during the last weeks to continue constructive 
discussions at the 18th round of negotiations" due on April 5-6 
in Moscow, and if similar approach was used by the Estonian side 
positive results at the forthcoming round could be hoped for. 
  "We hope that the Estonian side thought over the results of 
the 17th round and came to the conclusion that we have to find 
ways to compromise to solve some of the deadlocks," he said. 
  On Thursday, Estonian Decolonization Initiative Centre will 
hold a picket in front of the building of Estonian Foreign 
Ministry to support and encourage Estonian delegation before the 
18th round. "Estonian delegation should not choose the Latvian 
way on the issue of the retired Russian military, but has to 
lift up its chin," Juri Estam from the Center told ETA.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- As many as 1,000 illegal 
immigrants may at present be staying in Paldiski, Juri Tikk, 
special representative of the government in Paldiski, said 
Tuesday [29 March] at a press conference. 
  Estonian authorities in Paldiski registered 4,576 people by 
March 26. Civilians, with the exclusion of minors, numbered 
3,684; the remaining 892 were servicemen. Tikk claimed the 
majority of the town's residents turned up for registration. 
  Population Minister Peeter Olesk voiced the opinion that the 
greater part of the people who failed to register themselves 
were those who were absent from the town during the registration. 
  Tikk said Estonian authorities received on Tuesday the data 
about the Russian military who live in Paldiski but serve at the 
Tallinn base of the Baltic Fleet. The list comprised 69 names, 
he said. "We still haven't got a list of Russian servicemen who 
serve in the Tallinn-based 144th motorized rifle division but 
live in Paldiski," the government representative noted. 
  The registration of Paldiski's residents passed without any 
particular incidents, Tikk said. It will be followed up by 
analysis of the forms the residents filled in. The authorities 
also intend to find out the origin of forged documents that the 
registration brought to light. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- Estonian Interior Minister 
Heiki Arike yesterday approved the working plan of the Paldiski 
coordination commission. The plan maps out action before the 
start of dismantling of the nuclear reactors and foresees 
establishment of an emergency regime in the town for the time 
the reactors are opened and nuclear fuel is being removed. 
  The dismantling probably begins after April 10. 
  Arike told BNS the leaders of the coordination commission 
"maintain continuous contact with the Russian side." He said a 
joint meeting will in the near future take place in Moscow to 
once more go over the action during the dismantling of the 
reactors. 
  "The Estonian and the Russian commissions will in a sense 
fuse during the dismantling, because it calls for prompt 
exchange of information and joint action," the interior minister 
told BNS. 
  Estonia is responsible for security measures during the 
operation. Arike said the police, the rescue services and the 
border guards will be involved. 
  "If additional forces are needed in the area, they will be 
brought in from all over Estonia, not only Tallinn," the 
interior minister said.

  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- The Estonian Customs 
Department foresees no difficulties in coping with the Baltic 
free-trade agreement that comes into force April 1, Jaanus Raud, 
head of the Customs Department foreign relations division, said 
at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry today. 
  Since Estonia has no customs restrictions, the goods coming 
from Latvia and Lithuania will not add to the workload of 
customs officers, Raud claimed. Free-trade agreements with 
members of the European Free Trade Agreement have allowed the 
Customs Department to gain enough experience in issuing 
certificates of origin, so the addition of Latvia and Lithuania 
will pose no problems, he added. 
  Latvians and Lithuanians, on the other hand, may run into 
difficulties, since they have established a domestic market 
protection system and now face the task of checking 
certificates, Foreign Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre 
claimed. 
  Signe Ratso, an official from the Economics Ministry 
international relations department, added that many Estonian 
enterprises are impatiently waiting for the free-trade agreement 
to take effect to begin export of their output into the 
neighboring countries.

  [Excerpts] Today, esteemed listeners, you will hear a 
recorded conversation with the prime minister and not a regular 
live broadcast from the prime minister's reception. At the 
moment the prime minister is on his way home from Slovenia. We 
inform our listeners that the recorded conversation will be 
about Lithuanian foreign policy. Therefore, apart from the 
prime minister, Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys is also taking 
part in the conversation. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] The first 
question is to the prime minister: what are the objectives of 
the visit to Slovenia. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Now concerning the recent uproar which is 
felt here in Lithuania -- the Selma [construction company] case, 
the purchase of weapons, searches carried out in people's 
houses, and so on. Why does Russia show such a great interest 
in all this? Why such reaction? 
  [Prime Minister Slezevicius] The reaction, which was first 
of 
all voiced by Mr. Matochkin and Mr. Yegorov during their visit 
here, is about Russia's concern that the construction of houses 
in the Kaliningrad region may be discontinued. This is the 
official pretext for their concern. During our meeting and 
during our visit to the Kaliningrad region we made assurances 
that, as far as Lithuania is concerned, there would be no 
obstacles toward the construction being continued. [passage 
omitted] 
  The comments which appeared in the Lithuanian press 
concerning this criminal case is rather categorical, saying that 
the case is leading to high-ranking Russian officials, therefore 
it is only understandable that this causes them concern. I 
think that such allegations do not help in the normalization of 
our mutual relations. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Could you comment on the military transit 
from Kaliningrad and back? 
  [Slezevicius] The location of the Kaliningrad region is 
rather unique indeed. It is an enclave. Therefore, naturally 
it causes certain problems both to Kaliningrad and Lithuania, 
because in spite of our categorical attitude to this issue, the 
transit through Lithuania is unavoidable and therefore it is our 
task to determine the procedure with regard to how the transit 
of foreign transport should proceed through our country. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Foreign Minister Gylys] [Passage omitted] There is yet 
another question. I would like to clarify a report by the 
Baltic News Service concerning motor vehicle transit. Russia 
indeed wants some priveleges for motor vehicle transit. 
However, our state has...[pauses] Being aware on the one hand, 
as the prime minister has already mentioned, of Russia's right, 
perhaps a wish, to have access to the enclave, however, we have 
to be in control of all this movement. Therefore, the BNS 
report claiming that an agreement has already been reached on 
motor vehicle transit is premature. The problem is very complex 
indeed. 
  [Correspondent] The following rather pressing question is 
about relations with Poland. Here is the recorded voice of 
Augustinas Rimkus [not further identified] from Vilnius. 
  [Rimkus] Why is the text of the treaty with Poland being 
made 
secret? The article in the treaty concerning the occupation by 
Zeligowski should be confirmed not only by the representatives 
of the government but by the entire nation. All this should be 
condemned, however all this is being made secret. [end 
recording] 
  [Correspondent] There are more listeners voicing their 
concern that the texts of inter-state treaties are not made 
public in advance. 
  [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted] There is one point, however, 
whereby I can assure that this treaty fully corresponds to the 
interests of the Lithuanian state. Any attempt to aggravate 
inter-state relations is not wanted. We had to find mutually 
acceptable formulations which would satisfy both sides 
concerning the evaluation of the historical facts and, of 
course, ensuring the inviolability and integrity of our 
territory. These general principles have been recorded. The 
treaty has been initialled by Mr. Gylys, who is taking part in 
this conversation. 
  It is clear that in the second half of next month the visit 
by Polish President Walesa is to take place, during which the 
treaty will be signed, and of course, following this, the treaty 
will be made public. 
  [Gylys] It is of interest to note that when I arrived in 
Poland I was acquainted with the materials [not further 
specified] and I noticed that the formulations and statements by 
the radical forces are similar to those here in Lithuania. The 
Polish radical forces -- it is true that they are not as 
numerous as they are in this country -- say that with this 
treaty Lithuania has forced Poland to go down on her knees. 
Something similar is hear from the side of our radicals. 
  [Slezevicius] The initialling of the treaty, in spite of the 
radical voices mentioned by the minister, has been received 
essentially very positively. This will be a very positive step 
toward the normalization of our mutual relations. Following 
this an agreement on free trade, upgrading the border regime, 
joint work by the customs houses, and other steps must follow. 
The political treaty will become the foundation for the 
acceleration of our further economic relations. 
  [Gylys] The world community reacted positively to the step 
taken by us. Yesterday, I received a letter from U.S. Secretary 
of State Christopher. We also received a letter from France and 
we also expect more support. The world understands that 
relations with neighboring countries should be normalized. 
  [Slezevicius] [Passage omitted about the assistance given by 
the Scandinavian countries] 
  [Correspondent] I would like to ask you about Lithuania's 
relations with Germany. 
  [Gylys] Germany made a significant step by inviting the 
foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to the capital 
city. We had a five and one-half hour long consultation session 
on all issues. The main issue was our integration into Europe 
both in the economic, security, and political sense. We believe 
that Germany has adopted a very clear stance; Germany is our 
ally and demonstrated this unequivocally. 
  [Slezevicius] I would like to mention that Germany is our 
biggest trading partner in the West. Half of all the trade 
volume with the West is comprised of trade with Germany. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What are relations like with other European 
organizations, including NATO? 
  [Slezevicius] After 14 May last year, our dialogue with the 
European Union has been developing rather dynamically after the 
Maastricht Treaty. These are very important stages: our 
aspiration for a free trade agreement, an intensive dialogue, 
and consultations on this issue are taking place, much hard work 
is to be carried out by us. There is also the Partnership for 
Peace signed by the president. Our aspiration is to set up a 
peace-keeping battalion together with our neighboring countries, 
which would be the first serious step -- apart from the 
Partnership for Peace -- toward integration into the NATO 
defense structures. 
  We are aware that our gaining membership of NATO is a long 
process. Therefore, while being aware of this, we have to set 
up the basis for this in various aspects, which include the 
standardization of weapons, using the same methodology, and so 
on. [passage omitted] The confirmation by Germany that 
compensation will be paid for the damage [inflicted on Lithuania 
during World War II] has been reached. It is evident that the 
process of negotiations on this issue should be accelerated, and 
of course it must be specified in which way and by which dates 
this compensation will be met. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Vilnius, Mar 30, BNS -- The Council of Europe 
[CE] expects Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas to express 
his views on some key issues of his country's domestic and 
foreign policy. 
  Brazauskas is scheduled to make a speech at a session of the 
CE Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg April 14. 
  Traditionally, one or two state leaders are invited to the 
assembly's session. This time, Brazauskas will keep company 
with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat. 
  Heinrich Klebes, deputy secretary general of the CE, said 
although Lithuania is a small country, the assembly will listen 
"very attentively" to Brazauskas' report. 
  At a press conference in Vilnius Wednesday [30 March], the 
CE 
official said Brazauskas is expected to assess the situation in 
the Baltic states and in Russia. The CE would like to know the 
president's opinion about the prospects of Russia's membership 
in the organization and about the future of the Kaliningrad 
region, Klebes said. 
  Brazauskas is also expected to discuss some domestic policy 
issues, including Lithuania's preparation to join the European 
convention on human rights and freedoms. 
  The protocol of the assembly does not oblige state leaders 
to 
answer questions of assembly members, but in Klebes' words, the 
Lithuanian president is prepared to answer even spontaneous 
questions. "The Parliamentary Assembly appreciates this," the CE 
official said. 
  Commenting on prospects for the Baltic states to become 
associate members of the European Union, Klebes expressed 
certitude that this will happen soon, but reminded reporters 
that the matter is not within his competence. 
  On Wednesday, Klebes completed his four-day visit in 
Lithuania, during which he met with Lithuanian Parliament 
Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas, members of the several parliamentary 
committees and Lithuania's delegation to the CE Parliamentary 
Assembly. The CE official also visited the second biggest 
Lithuanian town of Kaunas. 
  Klebes said he is satisfied with the results of his stay in 
Lithuania. In his words, it is very important to maintain close 
ties with new members of the CE. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Here is the much awaited report on the reliability 
of the litas. Government press spokesman Viktoras Baublys 
informed us that while carrying out the decision of 17 March 
this year concerning the reliability of the litas -- the 
Lithuanian national currency -- and after coordination with the 
Lithuanian Bank, a decision was adopted by the Government of 
Lithuania on the base currency and the official exchange rate of 
the litas. 
  Therefore, the U.S. dollar has been determined as the base 
currency and the official exchange rate of the litas is four 
litas to one U.S. dollar.

  [Text] Late last night the Latvian Government gave its 
approval to the treaty with Russia which is to lead to the 
withdrawal of all Russian troops from the country by 31 August. 
Today, [Swedish] Premier Carl Bildt travelled to Riga in order 
to try to influence the Latvian Parliament also to approve the 
treaty. Lars Gunnar Erlandson reports: 
  [Erlandson] The lightning visit which Premier Carl Bildt is 
paying to the Latvian capital Riga today is almost exclusively 
about what will happen to the treaty which Latvia is about to 
conclude with Russia. There is strong opposition in the Latvian 
Parliament to the treaty, which the government has said it will 
be able to sign shortly. Everything indicates that the Russians 
will be able to retain a radar station in Skrunda, but one 
difficult issue is the rights which the Russians are demanding 
for the thousands of retired Russian military staff remaining in 
Latvia. 
  Latvian Premier Valdis Birkavs does not want to divulge what 
advice he has received from Bildt, but he stressed that Sweden's 
view of security in the Baltics is very important. This is what 
Premier Carl Bildt had to say after the discussions in Riga. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] I believe that the great 
significance of this troop withdrawal treaty is recognized here. 
At the same time, we recognize the very difficult decisions 
which this treaty means for Latvia, both with regard to the 
radar base in Skrunda and with regard to the rights following 
from this for certain military officers to retire here. 
  [Erlandson] Is that the hardest nut to crack? 
  [Bildt] It is difficult to know which is the hardest, but a 
treaty of this kind means coompromise on both sides. There is a 
strong nationalist opposition in Russia which does not want this 
treaty at all, and there is uncertainty here, too. 
  [Erlandson] But could there be a treaty where something is 
excepted, for instance the issue of retired officers? 
  [Bildt] That is part of the treaty, so I found it difficult 
to see that, as things are now developing. The treaty is 
written as a whole and all these things must be sorted out one 
way or the other in a relationship governed by a treaty between 
Latvia and Russia. One must be clear that, in the relations 
between a large country like Russia and a small country like 
Latvia, it is in the interests of the small country to have a 
treaty. A state without treaties can always be utilized by the 
big ones, treaties are always in the interests of the small 
ones. [end recording]

  [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt came to Latvia 
today for a brief working visit. The guest had a meeting with 
President Guntis Ulmanis and also with representatives of the 
Foreign Affairs Commission of the Saeima and its head, 
Aleksandrs Kirsteins. 
  The Swedish prime minister emphasized that, in his opinion, 
the initialled agreements with Russia should be signed, because 
such a process of dealing with relations between neighboring 
states is strengthening Latvian ties with Western countries. 
The stability of Latvia is also important to the Nordic 
countries. Also, the United States has become morally involved 
in the forming of the agreements. This process has been 
internationalized, and with internationalization the process is 
significant to the entire Western world. 
  The Swedish prime minister assessed positively the intention 
of Guntis Ulmanis to meet prominent European politicians in the 
nearest future. Quite probably official guarantees would not be 
given during these meetings, Bildt said. The talks, however, 
would assist foreigners in understanding better the difficulties 
connected with the signing of these agreements. 
  Ulmanis told the Swedish prime minister that the inhabitants 
of Latvia have diverse attitudes toward the initialled 
agreements between Latvia and Russia. There is also opposition 
to the government's and the Saeima majority faction's 
standpoint. In the latest sociological poll, 52 percent of the 
participants have expressed themselves against the Skrunda radar 
station remaining in Latvia. The president, too, is receiving 
many letters from writers who are against the initialled 
agreements. 
  The inhabitants are alarmed, most of all, over the social 
guarantees to former Soviet army officers that are envisaged in 
the agreement, because these will allow approximately 100,000 
officers and their families to remain in Latvia. There is also 
no conviction that Russia will fulfill these agreements. The 
president emphasized that it is also not clear what kind of 
guarantees the Western countries could give to Latvia. It also 
cannot be forgotten that Latvia was occupied in 1940, which 
Russia should, after all, recognize. 
  Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Foreign Affairs Commission 
of the Saeima, in turn explained to the guest that the position 
of the State of Latvia on the question of signing the agreement 
must be coordinated with Estonia, because she does not initial 
agreements with Russia in the sphere of social guarantees to 
military pensioners. The prime ministers of Latvia and Estonia 
will meet on 7 April to discuss these questions. The talks are 
envisaged in Rujiena, and the press center of the Cabinet of 
Ministers organizes representatives of the press who would like 
to accompany those travelling there.

  [Excerpts] Premier Carl Bildt was today on a brief visit to 
Riga, the capital of Latvia, and his aim was to try to speed up 
the agreement on the Russian withdrawal of troops from Latvia. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] The agreement exists on paper, but the 
Latvian Government has not taken a final decision on it and 
there is strong opposition in the parliament to some of the 
points in the agreement. One stumbling block has been the 
Russian radar base in Skrunda in west Latvia, but that is 
allowed to remain during a dismantling period of approximately 
five years. Bildt said that Sweden can think of economically 
assisting the dismantling. [passage omitted on Latvia's problem 
with retired Russian military personnel] 
  During his visit to Riga, Bildt held meetings with President 
Guntis Ulmanis and Premier Valdis Birkavs and representatives of 
the opposition. Russia is not treating its former obedient 
Latvia with enough respect. The Latvians for their part must 
understand that Latvians have most to gain from an agreement 
with the Russians -- that was Bildt's message. This is what 
Bildt said on what was discussed in Riga today:. 
  [begin Bildt recording] We have discussed the continuing 
process and this means both the process toward Russia -- where a 
meeting between President Ulmanis and President Yeltsin is 
currently being prepared, where certain outstanding questions 
will be solved -- and the process which must continue when we 
are creating increased understanding both in Latvia and in 
western countries for the Latvian security situation and 
concerns. [end recording]

  [Text] Riga, Mar 30, BNS -- The Saeima (parliament) 
Homeland and Freedom faction and several Latvian National 
Independence Movement deputies handed Wednesday [30 March] a 
declaration to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. 
  In the declaration the deputies demand to be informed about 
the control over the course of Russian army withdrawal, and 
measures which will be taken to prevent the growth of number of 
demobilized officers in Latvia, the Homeland and Freedom faction 
head, Maris Grinblats told reporters. 
  The deputies also demand that the Latvian delegation did not 
initial the agreement between Russian and Latvian governments on 
Russian military pensioners, living in Latvia, and their 
families' social guarantees. 
  Grinblats says that, in accordance with the Defense 
Ministry's given information, the leadership of the Russian 
Northwest Army Group tries to increase the number of retired 
militaries in Latvia. There can be observed a large scale 
demobilization of Russian officers in Latvia, and permissions 
for a stay in Latvia are asked also for the military personnel 
which has already moved to Russia. 
  The deputies consider that the Cabinet has not taken the 
necessary measures to prevent the demobilization of Russian 
militaries in Latvia and transmigration of Russian army in the 
territory of Latvia. They claim that the Cabinet has to prevent 
by way of legislation Russian militaries' involving in the 
activities of business structures, and it has to tightened 
control over procedure of issuing the stay permissions.

  [Text] Riga, Mar 30, BNS -- The signature and ratification 
of the agreement with Russia on troop withdrawal is in the 
interests of the Latvian security and sovereignty, the 
provisional board of the Popular Concord Party said Wednesday 
[30 March]. 
  The party says it cannot understand why the preparation of 
the agreements was delayed for two years, thus, losing the time 
when the agreement could have been based on terms more 
advantageous to Latvia. 
  The party is surprised why international experts have not 
unveiled their views on the environmental and health effect of 
the Skrunda radar yet. The findings missing, the radar facility 
has become an object of conflicts and political speculations. 
  The issue of the amount of rent for the radar's functioning 
should not be left only with the presidents of Latvia and Russia 
because the Latvian Constitution grants the country's president 
no such prerogative. The party wants Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs to also sign the anticipated rent contract.

  [Text] Trieste, 28 Feb (ANSA) -- The U.S. aircraft carrier 
Saratoga, in the Italian Adriatic port of Trieste to load 
supplies, will weigh anchor Monday afternoon [28 February], 24 
hours ahead of schedule, following the downing of four 
unidentified fighter jets over Bosnia, U.S. diplomats announced. 
  Those crew members on leave who are not notified and unable 
to return aboard in time will be sent to the NATO base in Aviano 
and flown to the carrier, which is on patrol duty to enforce UN 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. 
  [All humanitarian aid flights between the military airport

Bosnia"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 27 Feb (BELGA) -- One company of about 150 
Belgian UN troops left the Baranja region in eastern Croatia on 
Sunday morning [27 February], heading for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The Belgian UN troops, who are taking about 15 armored vehicles 
with them, are expected to arrive in Central Bosnia next 
Tuesday, Belgian military sources revealed on Sunday. 
  The decision to send Belgian troops to Bosnia follows a call 
for more troops from British General Michael Rose, the commander 
of the UN troops in Bosnia, who had requested reinforcements 
following the conclusion of a peace agreement between the 
Muslims and Croats there. 
  No final decision has yet been made on where the Belgian 
troops will be stationed. The front between Muslim and Croatian 
troops is 350 km long. An advance party of Belgian soldiers 
already left the Baranja region on Saturday, and is due to 
arrive Monday in Bosnian Santici in order to reconnoiter. 
Shortly afterwards a decision will be made as to where the 
Belgian troops will be stationed.

  [Text] Rome, 28 Feb (ANSA) -- NATO pilots were acting in 
compliance with the no-fly zone resolution 816 of the United 
Nations when they shot down four fighter jets over Bosnia this 
morning, Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri said. 
  "We are faced with a painful episode," Fabbri said, adding: 
"The fact remains that the international community and the 
United Nations want to make credible and coherent their 
willingness to guarantee global order and security, they cannot 
avoid the use of force with the aim of peace-making and 
providing humanitarian aid." 
  This, Fabbri said, is "the only way" the UN can maintain the 
authority and prestige necessary to keep the growing number of 
crisis areas around the world under control.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Fabbri on the `Russian Problem,' </F>
Italian Adherence"] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 Feb (ANSA) -- For Italian Defense Minister 
Fabio Fabbri, "the West once again faces the Russian problem" 
created by the void left after the dissolution of the Warsaw 
Pact. 
  "Either the West fills that void, or Russia will return to a 
position of dominance," said Fabbri, speaking at the sidelines 
of a ceremony to inaugurate the 84th course of the NATO Defense 
College at which he participated today along with President of 
the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 
  "The active role of NATO thus remains very important," the 
minister said, adding he concurred with the view of German 
Military Chief of Staff Klaus Naumann, who expressed with 
"crystal clarity" said Fabbri, what was usually said only 
cautiously in the political-diplomatic sphere: "The unpleasant 
truth that the West now has to face the Russian problem." 
  While that country was "politically and economically weak, 
it 
remains strong in conventional and atomic weapons," he added. 
"Perhaps as a result of this weakness," Russia now wants "a new 
Yalta conference and the right to a free hand over what it 
considers its untouchable sphere of influence," he said. 
  In other comments, Fabbri called Communist Refoundation's 
position on NATO "out of tune and frankly surprising." That 
left-wing party's secretary Fausto Bertinotti has declared that 
NATO was out of date and no longer needed. 
  "Never before as in this moment has the Atlantic alliance 
been so timely," said Fabbri "precisely because the cold war is 
over and it is necessary to seek a new equilibrium." NATO is 
"essential for Western security and for international order," he 
said. 
  (In other related news, it was announced that the secretary 
of Italy's Left Democrats would visit NATO headquarters in 
Brussels Monday [28 February], where he would meet Secretary 
General Manfred Woerner just before noon before attending a 
lunch with top members of the Alliance's military and political 
staff. 
  Occhetto's visit will be the first by a Left Democrat or 
former Italian Communist to the Allied command.

  [Text] Kronberg -- Russian Economics Minister Aleksandr 
Shokhin has expressed confidence concerning the upcoming talks 
with the finance ministers and heads of central banks of the 
seven major industrialized nations. After arriving in Kronberg 
this afternoon for the G-7 meeting, Shokhin stated: "We want to 
take this opportunity to improve our relations with the 
international financial organizations." 
  His delegation will first brief the G-7 representatives on 
the economic and political changes in Russia. Russia's goal is 
closer cooperation with the G-7 and the IMF. With its Bosnia 
initiative, Russia showed a few days ago that it continues to be 
a major power, Shokin pointed out. Russia must improve its 
cooperation with the West, both in political and in economic 
areas. Thus, the economics minister considers that expanding 
the G-7 -- which now consists of the United States, Japan, Great 
Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Canada -- to include Russia 
is desirable for political and economic reasons.

  [Text] Kronberg -- The summit meeting of the finance 
ministers and heads of the central banks of the seven major 
industrialized nations ended with an overall positive assessment 
this evening. The participants promised to continue aid for 
Russia. At the close of the meeting, Finance Minister Theo 
Waigel (Christian Social Union), who hosted the conference, 
stated that the preconditions for sustained inflation-free 
economic growth exist in Germany. 
  During the discussion of the second major topic -- aid for 
Russia -- the G-7 representatives from the United States, 
Germany, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, and Canada 
promised to continue the supportive measures for Moscow to the 
agreed extent. At the same time, they declared their readiness 
to support the conclusion of a comprehensive new rescheduling 
agreement with Russia. 
  However, during their discussion with the Russian 
delegation, 
the finance ministers of the Western industrialized nations 
expressed concern about the lack of progress concerning the 
stabilization of Russia's economy. They called on Russia to 
increase and accelerate its efforts to ensure macroeconomic 
stabilization and to reduce the budget deficit, the creation of 
credit, and inflation. Structural reforms, including secure 
legal framework conditions, are indispensable for domestic and 
foreign investors, because private capital must become the main 
source for financing the transformation process. 
  The Russian delegation, headed by Finance Minister Sergey 
Dubinin, assured the G-7 representatives of the new government's 
determination to continue the reform process. "These reforms are 
irreversible." According to Waigel, the Russian representatives 
formulated the following goals in Kronberg: A balanced budget, 
continuing fight against inflation, and an end to the dramatic 
production decline. The budget deficit of the central 
government, financed by credits of the Russian central bank, is 
to be limited to 4 percent of the BIP in 1994, and the monthly 
inflation rate is to be reduced to 7-9 percent by the end of the 
year. 
  The ministers and heads of the central banks of the G-7 as 
well as representatives of the European Commission welcomed the 
promises of the new Moscow government. Yet they strongly 
emphasized that a determined economic reform is the only way to 
ensure the advantages of a free market economy. 
  The G-7 representatives stressed that comprehensive 
financial 
aid in the form of rescheduling agreements, export loans, and 
initial credits by the international financial institutions have 
already been provided. More funds can only be released once the 
required preconditions are fulfilled. Opening up the market for 
Russian products to a greater extent is also an essential 
element of the G-7 strategy to support reforms. 
  According to Waigel, the Western finance ministers and heads 
of the central banks agreed that particular attention must be 
devoted to the social consequences of the transformation 
process. A credible program of accompanying social measures, 
designed to improve public acceptance of the reform process, are 
indispensable. Thus, they agreed to cooperate with Russia to 
improve the social network and the social infrastructure. They 
pointed out, however, that the financial means required for 
these tasks must be provided mainly by Russian sources. Yet the 
World Bank might play a special role in helping Russia establish 
efficient social infrastructures.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE (JLV): "Acceleration in European </F>
Union-Sweden Negotiations"; as released by BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 22 Feb (Belga) -- Sweden on Tuesday [22 
February] expressed its satisfaction with the development of the 
negotiations that should lead to its membership in the European 
Union [EU]. It thus welcomed the decision of the Twelve to 
create a new criterion for obtaining Community regional aid that 
would directly benefit the three Scandinavian countries on the 
threshold of the EU (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). 
  The Twelve are opposed to these three countries receiving 
regional aid as less-favored regions, insofar as the regions in 
question have a per capita income of around 80 percent of 
Community GDP, which is more than the 75 percent set as 
"objective 1." 
  For this reason, the European proposal created an "objective 
6" for eligibility to the structural funds concerning regions 
with a population density of less than eight people per square 
kilometer. 
  Most of the Nordic regions of Sweden, Norway, and Finland 
meet this criterion, and could therefore benefit from this 
Community godsend, evaluated by Luxembourg Foreign Minister 
Jacques Poos to be worth some ECU175 million per year. 
  This proposal is a "great step forward and constitutes a 
very 
good base for the rest of the negotiations," stressed Swedish 
Foreign Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel during a news conference. 
  "The fact that the specific situation of northern Sweden is 
recognized as such is very important," he added. 
  In addition, Sweden asked the Twelve to grant it a 
transition 
period during which its contribution to the Community "kitty" 
would not be greater than the benefits it would reap from 
entering the Community "club." 
  "From the start, we are ready to pay as much as we receive, 
but we would like a transition period up to 1999, after which we 
would contribute in full and would ensure the dynamic effects of 
our membership were felt," explained Mr. Dinkelspiel. 
  The Twelve did not, however, hide their reluctance on this 
point. Mr. Dinkelspiel admitted: "I must say that our proposal 
was not greeted with waves of enthusiasm." Such a hypothesis 
would put a serious strain on the benefits expected from the 
membership of the four countries, currently members of EFTA 
(European Free Trade Area), estimated to be worth ECU1.6 billion. 
  Foreign Ministry sources pointed out that Sweden would 
contribute almost half this sum (some ECU765 million), thus 
becoming the third largest contributor in the EU, and the 
largest contributor per inhabitant.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE (RHR): "Enlargement: Finland </F>
Satisfied, Norway Reluctant"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 22 Feb (BELGA) -- Finland has joined 
Sweden as the frontrunners for European Union (EU) membership, 
believing that Tuesday's [22 February] negotiations with the 
Twelve permitted "a significant step forward." 
  By contrast, the Norwegian delegation stated that it was 
disappointed by the EU's position on farming subsidies and 
regretted that the Twelve were unable to reach a common position 
on the thorny question of fishing, an essential economic 
resource for Norway. 
  "We have achieved major progress on the question of capital 
movements, secondary residences, and fishing, for which we have 
obtained a transitional period equal to that granted to Spain 
and Portugal," stated Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto. 
  On the other hand, invoking the extremely harsh climatic 
conditions in Finland, the minister had asked the Twelve that 
special arrangements in the matter of farm subsidies be extended 
to Finnish agriculture as a whole, and not limited to farms 
located beyond the 62d parallel. 
  He declared, however, he was satisfied by the Union's 
proposal to create an "objective 6" allowing sparsely populated 
areas to benefit from Community regional aid. 
  The Norwegians were much less enthusiastic. Trade and 
Maritime Transportation Minister Grete Knudsen stuck to her 
demand that the country's four Nordic regions benefit from 
structural fund "objective 1," which is aimed in principle at 
regions with a GDP below 75 percent of the Community average. 
It was not possible to discuss this question on Tuesday, but 
will undoubtedly be returned to the negotiating table when talks 
resume in Brussels on Saturday for negotiations "to the finish." 
The Greek presidency still aims to conclude the negotiations by 
the scheduled 1 March deadline. 
  The fishing question also poses major problems. The Twelve 
have not yet been able to adopt a common position on questions 
of access to fishery product resources and markets. Spain 
claims access to fish stocks in Norwegian waters, and France 
demands guaranteed market access for eight sensitive categories 
of fish, notably salmon, mackerel, herring, and shrimp. 
  EU ministers will meet on Friday evening in order to try to 
arrive at a common position allowing them to negotiate on this 
sensitive subject with Norway on Saturday. 
  Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos, who is presiding 
over the negotiations, stated he was "much more optimistic than 
a few days ago" on the chances of concluding negotiations by the 
date set.

<F P=106> [David Gardner report: "Aid for Arctic Region Agreed"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- European Union [EU] foreign ministers 
reached agreement yesterday in membership talks with Austria, 
Sweden, Finland and Norway on a regional aid programme for the 
Nordic countries' Arctic regions. 
  Austria warned, however, that the negotiations could 
collapse 
unless its concerns were met on lorry traffic through its Alpine 
passes. Switzerland decided last weekend to phase out truck 
transit rights through its own Alps. Because of the diverted 
traffic it now expects to receive, Austria wants the EU transit 
restrictions it negotiated with the Union to extend until 2005. 
The EU is offering 1997. 
  As both sides drew up positions for what is supposed to be 
the final ministerial negotiation between next Friday evening 
[25 February] and midnight next Monday, there were still 
seemingly unbridgeable wide gaps. Leading EU negotiators were 
predicting crisis. 
  The focal points of disagreement have been: how to cut 
Nordic and Alpine farm prices to EU levels and who should 
compensate the farmers; how much the newcomers should pay into 
the EU budget; Norwegian fish; and EU transit rights through 
Austria's Alps. 
  Regional aid could now be resolved. The Nordic countries 
reacted favourably yesterday to the new Arctic regime, offering 
funding only 10 percent less favourable than that for the EU's 
poorest regions (which will still be offered to Burgenland on 
Austria's border with Hungary). 
  By yesterday Finland had cleared most of its negotiating 
hurdles except for agriculture, and Sweden would be in sight of 
the finishing line but for its insistence on a three-year rebate 
from the EU budget. Austria also wants to phase in its budget 
contributions. 
  Money will overshadow much of next weekend's marathon talks. 
On agriculture, for example, the Twelve want instant food price 
cuts to EU levels, with the applicant countries paying the 
difference to their farmers. Austria and Norway want 
transitions to EU price levels, with border rebates to iron out 
the differences. This is regarded as an unacceptable threat to 
the border-free single market by all in the EU except Britain 
and fundamentalists in the Brussels agriculture directorate. 
  At Spain's insistence, the EU was last night set to demand 
modest access to Norway's fisheries resources in exchange for 
free entry of Norwegian fish into the single market -- still 
being resisted by France and Ireland. Norway's last membership 
attempt in 1972 was scuppered by the fish controversy, and Oslo 
has promised not to surrender a single fish to the EU. 
  Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's European affairs minister, 
said 
Madrid was willing to negotiate, but if the Norwegians "stick to 
that zero quota to the end, I foresee a catastrophe." As the EU 
finalised its common view on fish last night, a senior 
Commission official predicted that "any likely position we reach 
is going to be so far from the Norwegians as to make it 
impossible."

<F P=106> [John Palmer report: "EU Governments Could Lose Power To </F>
Veto Integration"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- A senior European commissioner has 
warned that the inclusion of northern and East Europe countries 
in the European Union [EU] may have to be followed by limits on 
national powers to veto further integration. 
  Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner for information and 
communications, said yesterday that as well as admitting four 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, the Union should 
offer part membership to countries in East Europe. 
  Mr Pinheiro, a former Portuguese foreign minister, was 
speaking as talks to admit Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden 
approach a climax this weekend. He said in Brussels that the 
inevitable opening up of the Union would require far-reaching 
changes to the Maastricht Treaty. 
  He insisted that as the Union expanded, there would be 
pressure to remove the power of individual governments to veto a 
majority of states moving to closer integration. 
  The Commission has in effect fired the first shot in what 
promises to be a controversial debate about how far, and how 
fast, the EU should move towards federal-style political union 
when the Maastricht Treaty is revised in two years' time. 
  "With enlargement about to happen, it is essential that we 
now begin the debate about institutional change," Mr Pinheiro 
said. "There are precedents for allowing some countries to move 
ahead while others stay behind." 
  He added that excluding defence from the Union in the 
Maastricht Treaty had been "a great mistake, which will probably 
be rectified in 1996." 
  His remarks will alert those in the British Government who 
want to ensure that constitutional changes continue to be 
subject to national veto. 
  But Britain is aware that if it opposes a system under which 
countries are allowed to opt out of specific new EU commitments, 
others will point out that this was precisely what John Major 
won for Britain in respect of social policy at Maastricht. 
  "The attitude to European Union membership appears to have 
changed recently in some of the EFTA candidate countries because 
of what may be called the Zhirinovskiy factor" -- the rise of 
Russian nationalism -- Mr Pinheiro said. "We may soon have no 
option but to offer countries such as Poland, Hungary and the 
Czech Republic membership of at least two of the three pillars 
of the EU." 
  He said that while the economic problems of the East 
European 
countries made complete integration in the EU unlikely in the 
short term, they should be allowed to take part in decisions 
affecting foreign, security and eventually defence policy as 
well as justice, immigration and the interior. 
  Under the Maastricht Treaty these, unlike other issues, are 
matters for joint decision by member states. 
  At the end of talks in Brussels yesterday, all but a handful 
of issues dividing the EU and the four EFTA countries had been 
resolved. Problems remain in agriculture, transit rights for 
lorries through the Alps and (with Norway) fishing rights. 
  "It is touch and go whether an agreement will be reached in 
time for the European Parliament to approve enlarging the 
European Union from 12 to 16 member states this summer," one EU 
diplomat said yesterday. 
  If final European Parliament ratification of the enlargement 
agreements is delayed until the autumn, the four new members may 
not be able to join by the agreed deadline of January 1995. 
  But Austria, Finland and Sweden seem certain to join by July 
next year, although the outcome of any referendum in Norway is 
still in doubt. 
  The three Nordic governments will meet in Helsinki on Friday 
[25 February] to plan tactics for what promises to be a marathon 
final negotiating session in Brussels this weekend.

<F P=106> [Article signed MPK/GGD: "European Parliament Says European </F>
Union Should Eventually `Absorb' Western European Union"; as 
released by Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 24 Feb (BELGA) -- On Thursday [24 
February], a large majority in the European Parliament [EP] 
voted in favor of a gradual rapprochement between the European 
Union [EU] and the Western European Union [WEU], leading 
eventually to "the absorption" of the WEU by the EU. The EU 
would then assume full responsibility for foreign policy, Common 
Foreign and Security Policy [CFSP], and relations with NATO. 
  In his report, Mr. Karel De Gucht, (Belgian EP member [MEP] 
representing the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] -- BELGA 
editor's note) advocates the gradual establishment of a single, 
coherent institutional framework for the EU's CFSP. According 
to the rapporteur, the establishment of such a framework implies 
the increased use of a majority vote regarding CFSP, the 
exercising of democratic control by the EP, and an enhanced role 
for the European Commission. 
  To this end, the report suggested that the institutions of 
the EU and the WEU should gradually define their relations in 
specific terms, and merge at the practical level, notably by 
organizing simultaneous meetings between the Council of the EU 
and the Assembly of the WEU, as well as between the European 
Commission and the General Secretariat of the WEU. 
  In the final phase, the EU should completely absorb the WEU 
and assume full responsibility for foreign policy, security, and 
defense, as well as for relations with NATO, indicated the 
report. 
  After having completed the final phase, in the event of 
"serious difficulties," Mr. De Gucht foresees the possibility of 
member states not participating in certain decisions made by the 
Council or in their implementation. 
  This final phase could be completed as of 1996, the year of 
the next intergovernmental conference of the EU which could 
decide purely and simply to "incorporate" the WEU on the basis 
of the future CFSP. Furthermore, the treaty founding the WEU, 
signed in 1948, will expire in 1998. 
  Regarding relations between the European Union and NATO, Mr. 
De Gucht believes that the WEU must continue to strengthen its 
operational capabilities so as to be able to act independently 
of NATO "in the long term," even if he recommends that the 
Allies and the Atlantic Alliance should "consult" each other 
first. He also advocates the "sharing of tasks" by the WEU and 
NATO, as well as the definition of various kinds of action. 
  Moreover, he envisions a future "adaptation" of the North 
Atlantic Treaty, or the signature of a new treaty between the 
United States and the EU "which better reflects the new 
egalitarian relations established on both sides of the Atlantic."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/P/94/10: "Commission Adopts a </F>
Communication on Immigration and Asylum"] 
  [Text] On a proposal from Mr. Flynn, Commissioner 
responsible for justice and home affairs, the Commission today 
adopted a communication on immigration and asylum policies. 
  Introducing the communication, Mr. Flynn said that "this 
document represents a significant and important initiative by 
the Commission. It will initiate a wide-ranging debate with the 
Council and Parliament and beyond on the long term strategy now 
needed to respond to the challenges posed by immigration and 
asylum on the one hand and integration measures for third 
country nationals legally resident in the community on the 
other." 
  Immigration, together with the separate but related subject 
of asylum, has continued to occupy an increasingly prominent 
place in the political agenda of the European Union and its 
member states. It gives rise to public and parliamentary debate 
of growing intensity, and occasionally is the focus of acts of 
violence totally out of character with Europe's traditions and 
laws. 
  There is increased recognition that the issues involved need 
to be tackled on a cooperative basis. That has found expression 
in the provisions of the treaty on European Union which formally 
designates the subjects as being matters of common interest, to 
be addressed in the context of a single institutional framework. 
  That is as it should be. The deepening of the European 
integration process calls for an integrated and coherent 
response, which combines realism with solidarity, to the 
challenges which migration pressures and the integration of 
legal immigrants pose for the Union as a whole. Failure to meet 
those challenges would be to the detriment of attempts to 
promote cohesion and solidarity within the Union and could, 
indeed, endanger the future stability of the Union itself. 
  The Commission therefore looks to this communication as a 
basis to stimulate a new and wide-ranging debate as to how the 
new possibilities which the treaty on European Union creates can 
be used to provide the coordinated response necessary, and the 
framework, to guide the Union in its future work. 
  To that end the communication takes account of the work 
already done and developments on the ground. In addition, it 
takes as its base a number of agreed starting points drawn from 
earlier discussions, in particular the need for a comprehensive 
approach which addresses the key components of an effective 
immigration policy: 

  -  action on migration pressure, 
particularly through cooperation with the main countries of 
would-be emigration to Europe; 
  -  action on controlling immigration 
in order to keep it within manageable structures; 
  -  action to 
strengthen integration policies for legal immigrants. 
  The advantage of a comprehensive approach of that kind is 
that it enables control and admission measures to be matched by 
long-term cooperation with countries and regions of origin and 
an active policy of advancing the situation of those third 
country nationals already legally resident in the Union. 
  The communication looks beyond the existing work programs of 
the Union in the relevant areas in ways designed to complement 
those programs. It seeks to be realistic while putting forward 
new ideas and a new emphasis on how policy objectives can be 
pursued in operational terms. 
<H5>  Action on The Causes of Migration Pressure </H5>
  The communication argues that this requires ensuring that 
immigration and asylum policies are fully integrated into the 
union's external policies, and that the various external policy 
instruments available to the Union are used to address the root 
causes of those pressures. That could involve action at a 
number of different levels such as in the areas of trade, 
development and cooperation policies, humanitarian assistance 
and human rights policies. 
  Effective action in this area also requires ensuring the 
availability of accurate information on current migration 
patterns and likely future trends. 
<H5>  Action on Controlling Migration Flows </H5>
  Action to control migration flows will also require a policy 
response at a number of levels. It will mean defining and 
implementing common approaches to admission policies as regards 
admission of workers, self-employed persons and students and the 
approximation of admission policies for humanitarian reasons. It 
calls for policies to deal more effectively with the problem of 
illegal immigration by way of preventive measures and measures 
to address the issue of persons illegally resident in the 
Community, with a particular focus on combating illegal 
employment. 
  Policies in respect of refugees and other persons in need of 
international protection also need to be addressed but the 
communication suggests that the focus here is of necessity 
different. The focus for the purpose of asylum policies should 
be on ensuring that the examination of asylum applications can 
continue to operate in a fair and efficient manner. The 
communication also deals with new issues thrown up by the war in 
ex-Yugoslavia by way of the development of schemes for temporary 
protection. It suggests that a Union committed to cooperative 
action could examine how best to show solidarity to help member 
states caught in a front-line position in responding to such 
situations. 
<H3>  Action to Strengthen Integration Policies for Legal 
Immigrants </H3>
  The communication stresses that action in this area remains 
an essential element of the wider need to promote solidarity and 
integration in the Union. What this requires will be to ensure 
that integration policies are directed in a meaningful way 
toward improving the situation of third country nationals 
legally resident within the community by taking steps which will 
go further toward assimilating their rights with those of 
citizens of the member states. 
  Strengthening integration policies will also involve action 
to create the right economic and socio-cultural conditions for 
successful integration by way, for example, of actions in the 
field of employment and education. Equally it requires 
promoting information and dialogue and combating racial 
discrimination and all forms of racism and xenophobia. 
  The various ideas which the Commission invites the 
Parliament 
and Council to examine are set out in summary form in Chapter IV 
of the communication in terms of a possible new framework for 
action by the Union. The ideas set out there are not intended 
to lay down a definitive work plan at this stage. They do, 
however, represent a coherent set of proposals which member 
states and the Commission itself will want to consider in 
drawing up a long term action program that is now required to 
take account of both the new challenges and new possibilities 
offered by European Union. The proposals contained in chapter 
IV should therefore be regarded as ideas to be discussed and 
elaborated upon in the debate which the Commission would wish 
this communication to launch. 
  Translating those ideas into action will represent the next 
phase. The Commission will equally seek to contribute to that 
process by using the various instruments at its disposal, both 
in relation to the plan of action adopted by the European 
Council in December 1993 and the new framework for action by the 
Union suggested in Chapter IV. 
  Commissioner Flynn expressed the hope that "a consensus will 
emerge which recognizes that the challenge which immigration and 
related issues poses for the Community, demands both a balanced 
and comprehensive response in keeping with Europe's best 
traditions."

<F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/147: "Commission Opens Free </F>
Trade Talks With the Baltics"] 
  [Text] The European Union [EU] yesterday held its first 
round of talks with the Republic of Latvia, following the recent 
decision by EU foreign ministers to instruct the Commission to 
negotiate free trade agreements with the Baltic states. 
  The delegations were chaired by Mr. Olgerts Pavlovskis, 
state 
minister for external trade and relations with the EU in the 
Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Daniel Guggenbuhl, 
head of unit in the European Commission's directorate-general 
for external economic relations. 
  This first round of negotiations was held in an open and 
constructive atmosphere. The parties had a general exchange of 
views on the various aspects to be covered by the agreement. 
Both delegations shared the view that the envisaged new trade 
agreement will be a further important step for the integration 
of Latvia into the European Union and that the negotiations 
should be concluded as soon as possible. 
  The Copenhagen Summit had invited the European Commission to 
submit proposals for developing the existing trade and 
cooperation agreements between the EU and the Baltic states into 
free trade agreements. The Commission presented its proposals 
on 1 December 1993. On this basis the Council adopted the 
negotiating directives for the three countries on 7 February 
1994. The negotiations with Estonia and Lithuania will start 
tomorrow and on 28 February.

<F P=106> [Gillian Tett report: "Car Industry Must Face Japanese </F>
Challenge"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Mr Martin Bangemann, EU [European 
Union] industry commissioner, yesterday warned the European car 
industry that Brussels would not protect it indefinitely from 
Japanese competition. 
  He said there would be no change to the EU-Japan agreement 
on 
market access, signalling that the commitment to open the EU 
market by the end of 1999 must stand. 
  But he held out the prospect of a substantial aid package to 
help restructuring and hinted that he expected to see further 
mergers along the lines of the Rover-BMW deal. 
  Unveiling a Commission strategy paper on the future of the 
European car industry, Mr Bangemann said: "We are not advocating 
mergers, (but) we do believe that not all the European car 
industry have the necessary size to compete in the world market." 
  He urged European car makers to target emerging markets in 
the Far East and Latin America for both sales and production. 
The commission is pushing for better market access for EU car 
exports in Japan, U.S., South Korea, East Europe and Turkey. 
  The agreement struck between Japan and the EU in July 1991 
envisages the progressive opening of European markets to 
Japanese imports by 2000, allowing Japanese exporters to 
increase market share when the European market is growing. 
  The Commission report calls for measures to tackle the 
structural weakness in the European car industry including: 
  1. Allocating EU funds for retraining workers, with up to 
ECU4bn of EU funds potentially available. 
  2. Developing joint programmes of research and development, 
with ECUl.3bn of funds likely to be earmarked between 1994 and 
1998. 
  3. New measures to smooth the operation of the internal 
market, such as streamlining the distribution system and 
harmonising vehicle taxes. 
  4. Introducing a range of environmental standards, aimed at 
promoting cleaner and more efficient cars.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Miguel Gonzalez] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Eurocorps should speak English, 
even though it has no British or North American participation. 
This is what Spanish officials think, and this is the view they 
will argue in discussions about Spanish participation in 
Eurocorps, the embryo of the future armed branch of the European 
Union. Talks will begin in February and are expected to conclude 
by sometime this spring. Belgium for its part insists on equal 
status for the Dutch language. 
  After 45 years of NATO, English is today the lingua franca 
of 
the armed forces, according to Spanish officials. A historical 
paradox: Spain, the last country to join the Alliance, is acting 
as the principal defender of the "Atlantic language." At this 
point, language is the Eurocorps' biggest stumbling block. 
  Originally it was expected that the 50,000-person European 
army corps initiated by President Francois Mitterrand and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the Franco-German summit at La 
Rochelle in May 1992 would have two official languages: those of 
its two founders. 
  Belgium, which decided to join on 25 June, about the time it 
assumed the EC presidency, demanded equal linguistic treatment 
for Dutch, its other official language. "I can't imagine myself 
having to go through an interpreter to give orders," warned 
French General Francois Clerc, the Eurocorps chief of staff. 
  With Eurocorps threatening to become a tower of Babel, 
agreement was reached on a formula that would be satisfactory to 
the Belgians, preoccupied as they are with problems of internal 
cohesion and estrangement between the francophone and Flemish 
communities, but without, according to Spanish sources, putting 
Dutch on the same footing as German or English. What it amounts 
to is that orders will be translated into Dutch whenever they 
must be translated into French or German--something that would 
not occur under ordinary circumstances, since most of the 
command structure is bilingual. Spain, less nationalistic in its 
approach, is not demanding coequal status for Castilian and will 
conform with normal usage respecting official acts and documents. 
<H5>  Polyglot Soldiers </H5>
  Spain has a different, less chauvinistic demand: It is 
insisting English should be the working language, substitutable 
for any of the other languages in daily operations. Spain 
maintains that the other partners need to know only one foreign 
language, while Spanish soldiers, working in proud isolation 
until just a decade ago, are asked to be polyglot. 
  At least that is the demand being made on the 12 NCO's and 
officers, one of them a general, who will be detailed by the 
Spanish Army to the Eurocorps headquarters established on 5 
November in Strasbourg (France). Modest in its pretensions, 
Spain does not aspire to command Eurocorps, not even on a 
rotating basis like General Helmut Willmann of Germany, though 
perhaps Spain could fill a high-level position on the 
headquarters staff. 
  After all, its contribution is less than those of its other 
partners: a Spanish brigade (3,500 men), compared to the 
division (10,000) contributed by each of the other three 
countries. The government decided on 10 December that the unit 
assigned to Eurocorps will remain in Spanish territory, leaving 
Spain only for maneuvers or to carry out a mission. 
  The formula for transferring command of the unit, still 
under 
discussion, will have to be compatible with Spain's obligations 
to NATO and with the accord reached in January 1993 between 
Eurocorps and the Alliance. Under the accord, Eurocorps will be 
placed under the allied command in case of conflict in Europe.

<F P=106> [Article signed KVB: "Netherlands UN Battalion Will Rush to </F>
Srebrenica"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] Brela, 24 Feb (ANP) -- The Netherlands UN battalion 
that is currently settling into the Croatian port of Split will 
endeavor to move into the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica sooner 
than expected. The "Dutchbat" has been assigned this task by UN 
Commander General Rose. 
  Originally, the battalion's first 300 infantrymen were due 
to 
go to Srebrenica on 6 March at the earliest. Now an attempt is 
being made to make this happen as soon as Tuesday [1 March], 
despite the transport problems with which Dutchbat is still 
fighting to come to terms. In his instructions for the 
Netherlands battalion, General Rose says that the operation must 
be carried out "as quickly as possible." 
  According to Lieutenant-Colonel W. van Dullemen, by issuing 
these orders, the UN general is assigning the Netherlands 
battalion with an extremely difficult task. Most of the 
infantrymen arrived in Split on Wednesday, and the plan was that 
they were supposed to remain there for one more week. Now, the 
300-man unit will have to leave on Saturday and head for the 
Netherlands supply center in Lukavac, from where it will 
continue on to Srebrenica. 
  The United Nations wants Dutchbat to enter the Muslim 
enclave 
faster than originally planned in an attempt to make the most of 
the relatively flexible attitude of the Serbs at the moment. 
That attitude could change if the United Nations soon attempts 
to re-open the airfield at Tuzla for humanitarian aid. UN Envoy 
Akashi has named 7 March as the target date by which Tuzla must 
be open once again. 
  Previously, the United Nations and NATO had not ruled out 
the 
possibility of using force, if necessary, to re-open Tuzla 
airfield. However, General Polle, the coordinator of the 
Netherlands operations, does not anticipate any armed action 
being necessary, despite the major objections that the Serbs 
have to the re-opening of Tuzla. According to Polle, the 
question will be solved through negotiations. 
  Polle views the call to action by his UN colleague, General 
Rose, more as an attempt by the British general to consolidate 
the presence of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] peacekeeping 
forces throughout the whole of eastern Bosnia. UN troops have 
become somewhat "thinner" on the ground recently following the 
transfer to Sarajevo of a company of Scandinavian soldiers. The 
Norwegian battalion is being deployed mainly around Tuzla. The 
United Nations wants to prevent the Serbian forces from hitting 
upon the idea of exploiting the gap that has been created as a 
result.

<F P=106> [Article signed JDT: "Dutch CDA Wins Support -- VVD Drops </F>
Back"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] The Hague, 22 Feb (ANP) -- With 40 seats, the Dutch 
Christian Democratic CDA has regained electoral support 
somewhat, following the sharp fall of recent weeks. In the race 
for second place, the PvdA [Labor Party], VVD [People's Party 
for Freedom and Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] are currently 
running neck and neck, recent opinion polls indicate. 
  The excitement among members of the principal opposition 
party, the VVD, over last week's 34 seats seems to have been 
rather premature. The Social Democratic PvdA has made something 
of a comeback with 30 seats. The advance of the liberal left 
D66 has apparently reached a strength of 30 seats. 
  These are the results of the latest polls published on 
Tuesday [22 February] and conducted by the interview bureau for 
the ANP press agency and the Dutch television current affairs 
program, NOVA. 
  Two weeks ago the CDA received a sharp setback following 
doubts about the future of the AOW, the Dutch pensions law. The 
party dropped in the polls to 37 seats, a dramatic loss of 17 
seats compared with their present strength of 54. The 24 
percent for the Christian Democrats was the lowest figure since 
the Lubbers/Kok government took office in November 1989. 
  Brinkman's party, who is heading the list of candidates, 
climbed back up to 26.2 percent in the survey which closed last 
Monday. That probably represents a gain of three seats compared 
to two weeks ago, but nevertheless a significant loss of 14 
seats. 
  PvdA, the coalition partner, scored 19.5 percent in the 
poll, 
which means that Kok's party is maintaining the momentum of 
growing support recorded over recent weeks. But with around 30 
seats, the loss of 19 compared with the present 49 is 
nevertheless quite dramatic. 
  The VVD, the big winner over recent weeks, has lost ground 
in 
this latest poll conducted by ANP/NOVA. Interview has dampened 
their enthusiasm somewhat, recording a score of 19.2 percent or 
29 seats, which means that the VVD falls back to fourth position. 
  D66 stands at 30 seats in the poll, a big gain of 18. But 
following the unprecedented advance of summer 1991 when it won 
36 seats, decline seems to have well and truly set in. Two 
weeks ago Van Mierlo's party still stood at 32 seats. The 
Greens have also made gains, up by 6.4 percent from 6 to 9 seats.

<F P=106> [David Owen report: "Mayhew Clarifies Sinn Fein Contacts"] </F>
  [Text] Government representatives have never been 
authorised to tell republican leaders that Britain intended to 
withdraw from Ulster, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland 
secretary, said yesterday. 
  But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might 
have been given to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an 
unauthorised meeting. The government has acknowledged that two 
unauthorised meetings did take place. 
  Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last 
night which claimed a government representative had told Mr 
McGuinness at a meeting three days after last year's Warrington 
bombing that Britain's long-term intention was to pull out. 
  Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: "Nobody has 
ever been authorised to say on behalf of the British government 
that the British government intends to withdraw from Northern 
Ireland." 
  A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting -- 
said to have taken place on March 23 last year -- made no 
reference to a signal from the British representative that 
Britain might withdraw. 
  Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the 
representative to the effect that "the final solution is union." 
  The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to 
play a part in achieving a settlement for the province "not 
because he likes Sinn Fein but because it cannot work without 
them." 
  "Any settlement not involving all of the people North and 
South won't work," Sinn Fein's note added.

<F P=106> [David Owen article: "Unionists in Warning on Peace Talks"] </F>
  [Text] Government attempts to broker a political 
settlement in Northern Ireland had a fresh setback yesterday 
when a senior Ulster Unionist said that his party's 
participation in future roundtable discussions could not be 
taken for granted. 
  The warning came as senior ministers stepped up their 
efforts 
-- in advance of Sinn Fein's annual conference near Dublin this 
weekend -- to persuade the IRA's political wing to accept the 
Downing Street declaration. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr 
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, used speeches in Birmingham and 
London to offer fresh reassurance to nationalists about the 
government's aims and intentions. 
  Sir Patrick sought to cover new ground in explaining how 
London expected north-south relations to develop. He emphasised 
that a settlement could provide new safeguards against 
discrimination. 
  As unionists in Ulster reacted suspiciously to Sir Patrick's 
remarks Mr James Nicholson, UUP [Ulster Unionist Party], 
chairman and leader of the party's team in the political talks 
process, warned that London and Dublin should "in no way" take 
the position of the province's largest party for granted. 
  Mr Nicholson, an MEP [member of European Parliament], said 
from Brussels that the UUP would not return to roundtable talks 
unless there was "a strong possibility that the process would 
move forward in a positive manner." 
  He emphasised that the UUP had not endorsed the declaration. 
  Mr Nicholson complained that his last meeting with Mr 
Michael 
Ancrarn, the Northern Ireland minister co-ordinating the talks 
process, was "quite frankly, a waste of time." He said: "The 
process was going nowhere. The whole thing does not add up as 
far as we are concerned." 
  Sir Patrick said there was a role for "new institutions 
which 
will recruit...the talents of all the people in the island of 
Ireland, so as to develop purposefully and profitably the 
relationship between the two parts of the island." 
  He said that as trust and confidence grew north-south 
institutions could "help transform the relationship between 
nationalists and unionists and -- but only if it was so agreed 
they could take on an increasingly dynamic role on the island 
and beyond it." 
  There was "no necessity for these institutions to impinge on 
either country's sovereign independence." 
  Sir Patrick said a political accommodation "might well" 
include "some form of entrenchment of human rights." He added: 
"There could be agreement to ensure that the nationalist and 
unionist identities would genuinely and in practical ways, enjoy 
parity of esteem."

<F P=106> [Report by Michael Cassell, Tim Coone and David Owen: "Major </F>
To Make Offer to Sinn Fein"] 
  [Text] Mr John Major will today make a fresh appeal to 
republican leaders to embrace the Northern Ireland peace 
process, offering Sinn Fein a full place in political life in 
return for an end to IRA violence. 
  In a carefully worded message on the eve of Sinn Fein's 
annual conference in Dublin, the prime minister will attempt to 
tip the debate within the republican movement in favour of 
accepting the Downing Street declaration. 
  In today's IRISH NEWS, the Belfast-based nationalist 
newspaper, Mr Major is expected to offer the most detailed 
exposition to date of the way ahead for republicans once the 
joint declaration has been accepted. 
  He was backed yesterday by a call from Mr Albert Reynolds, 
his Irish counterpart, for republican acceptance of the 
declaration. Mr Reynolds urged Sinn Fein to adopt a policy of 
non-coercion of Ulster's Protestants. 
  He said: "What the peace declaration offers is a future free 
of coercion, British or Irish, loyalist or republican. That is 
the huge psychological step that we are asking not just 
republicans, but everyone, to take." 
  It also emerged yesterday that Mr Michael Ancram, the 
Northern Ireland minister, is ready to begin more detailed 
discussions with the province's constitutional parties. 
  Mr Ancram expects within days to start exploring the 
parties' 
reaction to the checklist of ideas drawn up earlier this month 
by Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary. 
  The talks are to run alongside discussions between officials 
in London and Dublin on proposals for a new political 
settlement. Ministers hope for progress on both elements of the 
talks process by the next Anglo-Irish intergovernmental 
conference on March 10. 
  Against a background of mounting unionist hostility towards 
the direction of the UK-Irish political initiative, the Ulster 
Unionists -- the province's largest party -- will on Monday 
publish its proposals for a settlement. These will focus mainly 
on a devolved government for Ulster. 
  Although a definitive Sinn Fein response to the Downing 
Street declaration is not expected to emerge from the 
conference, due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the UK over 
the issue of "clarification," Dublin has in effect pointed to a 
way in which the deadlock might be broken. 
  Mr Reynolds referred positively to a recent article by Mr 
Mitchel McLoughlin, Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland chairman, 
stating that Protestants in the province should not be coerced 
into a united Ireland. If the Sinn Fein conference were to make 
"a clear endorsement of a policy of non-coercion" of the 
unionists, this would represent "an immense step forward," Mr 
Reynolds said.

<F P=106> [Article by George Walden MP, former diplomat in Beijing: </F>
"The Governor Has Got It Wrong"] 
  [Text] Some years ago Mrs Thatcher asked me, as someone 
who had lived and worked in Beijing and Hong Kong, whom she 
should send as Governor of the colony. Whoever it is, I 
replied, don't send a politician. In Hong Kong we are in the 
classic British position of having responsibility without power, 
and it would be wrong to promise things we are in no position to 
deliver. 
  British policy in Hong Kong today is worse than a failure: 
it is immoral. As 1997 approaches, our press and Parliamentary 
opinion seem motivated largely by conscience-salving, which 
makes rational discussion difficult. The mood of national 
escapism has reached the point where to dissent from official 
policy is to be branded an agent of a foreign power. 
Nevertheless I shall try to dispel some of the myths. Like 
garbage disposal, someone has to do lt. 
  How can defiance of China in the cause of democracy be 
immoral? Philosophers have a handy way of deciding these things. 
You simply examine the aims, means and consequences of an 
action, and see whether they add up. In the case of the attempt 
to extend democracy in Hong Kong a few years before China takes 
over, the means and the consequences of our actions are so 
questionable that the aim itself has become suspect. 
  The objective might seem above criticism: to give a greater 
measure of representative government to a people who, we now 
discover should have had it all along. This is the first of the 
comforting falsehoods that have dominated the discussion. It 
was never possible to have anything approaching a serious 
democracy in Hong Kong. 
  Assume that we had mounted elections, in the teeth of 
Chinese 
opposition, on what they see as their territory. There would 
have been an anti-Beijing Party, and the communists would have 
seen to it that they were countered by a pro-Beijing party. The 
result, especially at times of crisis on the mainland, would 
have been blood on the streets. The murderous riots of 1956 and 
1967 were a taste of that. China made it clear years ago that 
they would see serious moves to democracy as a prelude to the 
independence of a part of their country. 
  Another myth fashionable amongst escapologists from the 
responsibilities of decolonisation is that our policy in Hong 
Kong since 1949 has been dictated by "Foreign Office Mandarins." 
Leaving aside the question of how the colony has succeeded as 
well as it has, this puts successive British prime ministers and 
foreign secretaries in a poor light, not least Lady Thatcher. 
  Was that notoriously weak-willed woman such putty in the 
hands of the "mandarins" that she failed to insist on a proper 
democracy in Hong Kong as part of the Sino-British agreement? 
Or could it be that, like honest men before her, having 
examined the realities, she backed away from the risk of sterile 
confrontation with China? Of course Lady Thatcher claims to 
support British policy now, but it is what is done in office 
that counts. 
  Today we are told that the approach of the handover to China 
and the Tiananmen Square massacre have politicised the 
territory, whether we like it or not. To an extent that is 
true. How have we set about channelling the democratic 
aspirations that exist, reflected in the latest legislative 
council vote for reform, faced with the remorseless fact of 
mainland sovereignty in 1997? 
  By putting China publicly on the spot. In principle there is 
nothing wrong with that. We did it in 1967 when we refused the 
mainland's demands, shot some communist rioters and imprisoned 
hundreds of others. The question then was simple: whether we 
governed the territory, or they did. The position today is that 
they are going to govern it, and have threatened to dismantle 
whatever new democratic arrangements we put in place. 
  I have heard no rational explanation of the Governor's 
decision to make the speech he did on arrival, promising more 
democracy without reference to the Chinese. He would have got 
little, maybe nothing. Logically, therefore, only two 
explanations are possible: either we believed the paranoid 
gerontocrats in Beijing would be swayed by the Governor's 
sincerity and eloquence, and fall into line, or the speech, and 
all subsequent actions, were undertaken in the knowledge they 
would provoke a confrontation with China, without improving the 
long-term democratic lot of the people of Hong Kong. 
  Whatever the outcome, our secret hope is that the history 
books will say "at least the British had a go." In challenging 
China to a duel we cannot win, we are more likely to stand 
accused of naivety, vaingloriousness, or cynicism. 
  What do we think will induce a communist climbdown? Chinese 
sensitivity to international opinion? If that is our hope then 
the proponents of our policy take a more benign view of the 
Chinese communists than I do. Or are we so sure a more liberal 
regime will emerge that we can confidently take risks in the 
meanwhile? And what if it doesn't? 
  There has been much talk of "British honour." It is well 
there is no Dr Johnson around to expose the hypocrisy of that. 
Securing your "honour" by risking the welfare of others seems 
of questionable morality. Rather than seeking to bathe our 
retreat in a heroic light, we should ask ourselves what the 
effects of our actions are likely to be on others. So lost in 
wonderment have we become at our own virtue and daring, that we 
have rather overlooked that. 
  As a result of our actions it is probable that the Chinese 
communists will be that much more repressive than they would 
have been anyway. But then think of the resonant speeches we 
shall be able to make in defence of this democratic politician, 
that human rights activist, or that free-spoken editor when they 
are pressured or locked away by the communists. Our policy may 
not be moral but it is profoundly self-gratifying. 
  Among our other sudden discoveries are the Hong Kong Chinese 
plutocrats whose enthusiasm for democracy is tempered by their 
interest in keeping in with their future masters. A dismal 
spectacle to be sure. But these are our much vaunted role 
models of capitalist enterprise, on whose ambivalent 
relationship with the mainland much of the colony's prosperity 
has been built. If we didn't want to get our hands dirty, we 
should never have grabbed Hong Kong in the first Place. 
  When it came up in Parliament some years ago, I questioned 
not the desirability, but the feasibility of democracy. Until 
today I have avoided criticising our stance publicly, and 
declined to discuss it on the media. I am all too familiar with 
the techniques of Chinese propaganda, which will now quote me as 
saying that our policy is "immoral" while ignoring my argument. 
I also find the tone of the domestic debate, with its facile 
division between "China-hands" and sturdy opponents of 
communism, tiresome and juvenile. 
  If I write in strong terms, it is because, like anyone who 
knows it, I am sentimental about Hong Kong, where I once lived 
with a Chinese family who taught me T'ang poetry in a tenement. 
Despite everything, I remain optimistic about its future, and I 
know enough about China to be wary of my own predictions. I 
would just like to be convinced that our policy is directed to 
the welfare of the people of Hong Kong, and not to our own moral 
vanity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hanging On to the End in Hong Kong"] </F>
  [Text] Britain and China yesterday came to the end of the 
line three years before Hong Kong is handed back. Abandoning 
all hope of an agreement with Beijing Chris Patten has invited 
the Legislative Council (LegCo) to decide Hong Kong's own 
political future. In publishing his second-stage bill today on 
democratic reform, Mr Patten signals his reasonable conclusion 
that negotiations with Beijing in the past year have achieved 
very little and that the timetable for the 1995 elections can no 
longer be delayed. 
  His action will be viewed by the Chinese government as a 
hostile act which finally demolishes the spirit of Anglo-Chinese 
cooperation in which the 1984 Joint Declaration was agreed. The 
hope must be that Beijing will show restraint and take a cool 
look at what has emerged by 1997, not before. But imperial 
pride has been wounded and China may well be tempted -- in the 
familiar phrase -- not to "stand idly by." 
  There is a sense in which the Chinese government can fairly 
say that it has been misled by Britain over a number of years. 
The British white paper claims that democracy was not 
introduced earlier to Hong Kong because "the community had other 
priorities." Certainly the Beijing massacre stimulated a much 
more passionate pro-democracy demand. But the Hong Kong 
government had already shrugged off mounting local pressure from 
1984 onwards for electoral reform, leaving too much to be done 
too late and too provocatively. Even after Tiananmen Square, Sir 
Percy Cradock's secret mission to Beijing on behalf of Mrs 
Thatcher encouraged China to believe that further political 
change would continue to be based upon clear "understandings." 
Chris Patten then shattered the familiar rules of the game like 
a typhoon from nowhere. 
  He was certainly right to do so. A large section of Hong 
Kong opinion would have been demoralised if a new governor had 
continued to defer to Beijing. Today Hong Kong opinion remains 
remarkably solid: the decision to go ahead arouses more relief 
-- that the uncertainty is over -- than alarm at what China may 
do. But beyond the principle, Mr Patten's tactical judgment on 
how to deal with Beijing has not always been so sound. 
Diplomats may say too little: politicians tend to the opposite. 
Voicing opinions about the future of the Chinese Communist 
Party is not the most tactful activity for the last governor of 
Hong Kong. 
  The LegCo now has the task of debating Mr Patten's original 
1992 proposals. It may end up by incorporating some of the 
concessions offered by Britain to China in last year's long 
negotiations. Perhaps there is a feeling in some diplomatic 
quarters that this might be a better idea. But those 
concessions only made sense as long as China agreed to a 
"through train" formula which would guarantee that the 
legislators chosen in 1995 could "ride through." Beijing 
objected to this more than anything. A watered down package 
will please no one. Hong Kong has already endured a rough ride 
with impressive calm: it should hang on now to the end.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Over to LegCo"] </F>
  [Text] Mr Chris Patten, the governor of Hong Kong, will 
today publish the second and more controversial of his two 
electoral reform bills. China has not availed itself of the 
chance for further discussion offered by Mr Patten's decision to 
delay this bill, while going ahead with the supposedly 
"straightforward" items in a separate bill which was passed by 
the Legislative Council (LegCo) on Thursday [24 February]. Mr 
Patten could not delay any longer if arrangements are to be in 
place for next year's election. 
  He has not chosen to incorporate into the bill any of the 
concessions which the UK offered during eight months of 
fruitless negotiations with China last year. These concessions 
were not popular with the pro-democracy block, which comprises 
most of the directly elected members of LegCo, and without whose 
support the bill would certainly not pass. But, by publishing a 
detailed record of the negotiations in a white paper yesterday, 
the British government has dropped a broad hint to centrist 
members of LegCo about the sort of amendments it could live 
with. Mr Patten's advisers reckon the pro-democracy group is 
more likely to vote for the bill after it has been amended in 
LegCo than if the concessions are presented as British 
government policy. 
  Outsiders may well wonder what is the point of this 
parliamentary gavotte, when China is serving notice that it will 
ignore the result and dissolve the offending LegCo as soon as 
Beijing assumes sovereignty in 1997. It seems quixotic for 
Britain, after conceding so much, to be jeopardising its 
relations with the world's most populous country and 
fastest-growing economy for the sake of a few extra seats in an 
assembly which will only last two years. 
  With hindsight, it seems naive of Mr Patten to have imagined 
that he could persuade China, by a public demonstration, to 
accept more than it would in private talks. We shall never know 
whether, if he had not chosen this method, China might have been 
more willing to accept the "through train" arrangement giving 
LegCo members elected in 1995 security of tenure until 1999. 
  Yet if he had not set out his proposals in public he would 
certainly have been criticised, both in Hong Kong and in the UK, 
for not even attempting to set up a representative legislature 
before handing the colony over to Chinese rule. Wednesday's 
vote on his first bill, when he actually had a majority larger 
than the one that backed his original proposals, and including 
almost all the directly elected members, suggests that support 
for what he is trying to do persists among the general 
population, although this is not true of the business community. 
At least this way he is giving Hong Kong people the chance to 
experience two years of relative democracy, if they so choose, 
and to leave China's rulers with the responsibility of 
dismantling it in full view of the world, if they so 
choose.

<F P=106> [Simon Jenkins article: "War Gets a Second Wind"] </F>
  [Text] Listen to the cheering. The shelling of Sarajevo 
has ceased, and all thanks to American diplomacy, NATO bombers 
and British generals. Our television screens will no longer see 
this nightly pollution. At last we have done something well in 
Bosnia. Hurrah for intervention. Now let the peacemakers of the 
air move on to Tuzla and Gorazde, to Maglaj and Bihac, to the 
ratruns and sewers of Mostar. 
  As so often with Bosnia I must rub my eyes in disbelief. The 
one truly significant event of the week has been the arrival of 
Russians in the Bosnian stew. The Serbs were never going to 
capture Sarajevo. Their guns were merely securing a status quo 
partition of the city. Had NATO planes tried to bomb those 
guns, they might or might not have pulled back. What is sure is 
that a wider guerrilla war against aid convoys and foreign 
troops would have ensued and the Russians would have ended any 
UN consensus. This would have been disastrous for everyone -- a 
point Douglas Hurd has pleaded in vain in Washington and Paris. 
  In the event, Boris Yeltsin has saved the West from its own 
recklessness. The Serbs have been given cover for a tactical 
withdrawal from Sarajevo -- to concentrate on fighting Muslims 
elsewhere -- with a guarantee that the Serb positions would not 
come under Muslim counterattack. Mr Yeltsin also warned NATO 
not to try any bombing threats elsewhere in Bosnia. He marched 
his troops into the cheering Bosnian Serb capital of Pale, and 
with good reason declared a triumph for Slav solidarity. 
  Perhaps the Bosnian civil war can now end happily and soon. 
Perhaps the coming of the Russians will dissuade the Muslims 
from a spring counteroffensive: good news for desperate 
civilians caught on the front lines. Perhaps Bill Clinton will 
find some other outlet for America's periodic craving to bomb 
foreigners. Perhaps Lord Owen will even persuade the Muslims 
that they must sooner or later live under UN protection 
surrounded by a new Croatia/Serbia, and may as well do so now. 
Perhaps the internationalisation of this war will stop. 
Perhaps pigs will fly. 
  Only the most deluded could see the events of the past week 
as other than a victory for Russia and Serbia. Certainly the 
Sarajevo government is not cheering. It said, with rare 
realism, that NATO had entrenched Serbia's aggression and 
pre-empted any new Muslim offensive. The siege guns may have 
fallen silent; as at Srebrenica, the price is the silence of the 
besieged. Sarajevo is now to become the playground of 
international statesmen, another Berlin or Beirut. Lord Owen 
said yesterday that the time had come for everyone, "both the 
Americans and the Russians, to become more heavily involved." 
God preserve the place. Into Sarajevo's green lines and 
enclaves will pour superdiplomacy, supercharity, prestige and 
unctuous concern. As Tweedledum remarked, let's fight until six 
then have dinner...and then perhaps fight again. 
  In asking Russia to commit soldiers to Bosnia, NATO this 
week 
put a bullet in its revolver, spun the chamber and placed the 
barrel at its head. Slav revanchism in Yugoslavia was the final 
horror against which the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey 
Kozyrev, jokingly warned the West a year ago. With troops 
committed to a Slav civil war -- forget their blue berets -- 
what Russian politician will dare withdraw them short of victory? 
  What then if some foolish European politician (such as 
Malcolm Rifkind last week) goads America into sending troops to 
help lift the Serbian sieges? If America believes the bombing 
threat changed everything in Sarajevo last week, why not go 
further? Why not see if the Russians are bluffing? Drop a few 
bombs to test them. Send a few troops. After all, it was only 
a handful of advisers that Lyndon Johnson sent to Da Nang in 
1965, after 150 bombers failed to convince the Vietcong of 
America's commitment. 
  What we are seeing in Bosnia is a crucial turning point in 
the course of an intervention. The NATO/UN forces are no longer 
obeying their original objective of escorting humanitarian aid. 
They are plainly seeking a war aim, a shift in the military 
balance of a civil conflict. This is the shift against which 
every strategist warned two years ago. The magnetism of war 
distorts rules of engagement. Escorting convoys becomes 
returning fire in self-defence. 
  Mediating skirmishes becomes drawing maps and negotiating 
ceasefires. Protecting enclaves becomes aiding combatants. 
Delivering supplies becomes taking sides. And as you sink into 
this mire, you beckon frantically for others to join you, even 
Russians. 
  The media have invented a new tense in which to advocate 
these risky adventures: the unfulfillable future conditional. 
In Somalia American forces were encouraged ashore but only "if 
they leave behind a new political and security framework." So 
said a unanimous British and American press. There was no 
chance of this condition being met, but the armchair strategist 
was neatly off the hook. He could accuse the 
non-interventionist of cowardice, yet blame the eventual fiasco 
on "failures of implementation." 
  Similarly, Sunday's relief of Sarajevo is hailed as a 
vindication of air power, but only if the Serbs can show 
themselves magnanimous towards the Muslims and not simply shift 
their guns and soldiers elsewhere. (In which case NATO will 
have cynically abetted Serb aggression.) Again, the condition 
will not be fulfilled and the media and opposition politicians 
will heap scorn on governments for not "giving the UN the tools 
for the job." A month ago, John Major was being asked in the 
Commons when he was going to pull out of Bosnia. Yesterday MPs 
demanded to know which city he would relieve next. Foreign 
intervention is a whimsical affair. 
  I believe that for two years the outside world has 
contrived, 
however messily, to do the right thing in former Yugoslavia. It 
has offered two services to a nation for whose factionalism it 
is not remotely responsible: a conciliation forum in Geneva and 
huge charitable relief. The UN's one mistake was to support 
that relief with soldiers -- unlike in Ethiopia or other recent 
civil wars. It thus gave each side the opportunity to plead 
with the soldiers for help and taunt them for their impotence. 
  Both services lost their point at least a year ago. As Lord 
Owen and others have recently admitted, intervention is almost 
certainly prolonging the conflict. The Muslims are rearming and 
recovering some lost ground. Mercenaries are everywhere. Rural 
communities are looting food, money and presumably weapons meant 
for the besieged. Each side can blame outsiders for their 
misery, while denying their leaders any negotiating manoeuvre. 
  A month ago UN troops seemed on the brink of being withdrawn 
from Bosnia. Barely a quarter of relief supplies were reaching 
their intended destination. UN soldiers were dying. Yet it was 
apparent to the Geneva negotiators that no side was exhausted 
enough to sue for peace. The French were reluctant to pull out, 
trapped by domestic politics, but Britain was ready to leave, as 
were the Dutch. The Bosnians might at last have been left to 
find their own path to peace, and the aid agencies left to do 
the best they can unprotected. 
  The mortaring of Sarajevo market on February 5 -- by whom is 
still unclear -- put paid to that. There is no more powerful 
magnet to military escalation than foreign corpses on American 
television and a talented (rather than a whining) general on the 
ground, in the form of Britain's Sir Michael Rose. Withdrawal 
suddenly became unthinkable. That fell phrase was heard, 
"NATO's patience is exhausted." The gods of war put on the 
clothes of peace and banged their drums. Convoy assistance was 
no longer the objective. Ceasefires had to be enforced. Bosnia 
now faces the Tolstoyan fate of being a land over which foreign 
powers will test their strength. 
  We are back to square one. Satellite reconnaissance plots 
new Serbian targets. Battalions go on standby. Those not yet 
committed, the Americans and the Germans, are shown the white 
feather. Behind the strident editorials can be heard the 
strains of "Oh What a Lovely War." We have lifted the siege of 
Sarajevo as we lifted that of Mafeking. Which siege next, Mr 
Major? Are you a man or a mouse? So what if the Russians are 
really on the other side. We have dealt with their like before. 
Now is no time to cut and run. Come on in America. This is 
where your president can find his glory. To war! 
  I wish we would all get out of Bosnia and leave it to finish 
its own dreary business on its own. We are not helping. We 
congratulate ourselves for Sarajevo. For what? For showing how 
good we are at prolonging other peoples troubles.

<F P=106> [Emma Tucker report: "CBI Forecast Trims Hopes for Economy"] </F>
  [Text] Manufacturers saw the best improvement in order 
books for four years in February, but have lowered their 
expectations for economic expansion. 
  The Confederation of British Industry [CBI] yesterday joined 
most other economic forecasters in predicting that the economy 
was poised for only modest growth -- 2.3 per cent this year and 
2.4 per cent next year. 
  The CBI said the downward revisions from last November's 
forecasts -- 2.4 per cent and 2.8 per cent respectively 
reflected the expected impact of tax rises and cuts in public 
spending in the next two years. 
  Meanwhile, its latest industrial trends survey showed that 
the net proportion of companies assessing order books as below 
normal is the least negative since September 1989. Some 19 per 
cent reported their books to be above normal, while 30 per cent 
said they were below. The negative balance of 11 per cent 
compares favourably with negative balances of 21 per cent and 36 
per cent in January and February last year. 
  Export order books are also significantly better than they 
were a year ago, although there has been no improvement since 
December, suggesting a rise in home demand. 
  The survey, carried out between January 24 and February 16, 
covered 1,360 of the UK's biggest manufacturers, which account 
for about half of manufactured exports. 
  It shows that slightly more companies expect to increase 
domestic prices in the next four months than to reduce them. 
The CBI expects inflation to reach 3.1 per cent by the end of 
this year and 3.7 per cent by the end of next year. The 
underlying measure which excludes mortgage interest payments -- 
will stay within the governments 1 per cent to 4 per cent target 
range, but nearer to the top end. 
  Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director, said: 
"Last November's Budget introduced a more restrictive stance on 
personal taxation than we had previously anticipated. This has 
contributed to our downward revision of growth in national 
output." 
  He added that the tax changes had altered the composition of 
economic growth. Consumer spending was now expected to rise 
moderately this year and next, but this would depend on 
individuals running down their savings to offset the slow growth 
in take-home pay. 
  The CBI expects the balance of payments to stay flat this 
year at about 9.7bn pounds -- compared with 9.5bn pounds last 
year -- as recovery in continental Europe leads to a rise in 
exports. Unemployment will fall only slowly. 
  It stressed that a big risk to the forecasts was uncertainty 
about the way in which the economy was likely to respond to the 
spring tax rises. Although the forecast assumes that consumer 
spending will continue to rise, the CBI pointed out that 
consumers could turn out to be more cautious than expected.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Bundeswehr has ended its 
humanitarian mission in the Somalian city of Beledweyne. As the 
3d Corps, which is responsible for the Somalia units, stated in 
Koblenz on Monday [28 February], the last FRG soldier left the 
East African city. There is no more material from the German 
Armed Forces in the desert city and the tent city has been 
completely dismantled. 
  The Bundeswehr mission started last May. In August, 1,700 
German soldiers were operational. The main task for the 
Germans, to provide logistical supply for an Indian brigade, 
could never be fulfilled because the Indians were not stationed 
in the Beledweyne area. Hence, the Bundeswehr contingent 
concentrated on humanitarian aid for the population of 
Beledweyne and the neighborhood. The troops built schools and 
dams and dug wells. 
  A spokesman for the 3d Corps added that the last convoy is 
on 
its way to the Somali capital Mogadishu, some 370 km from 
Beledweyne. There have been no incidents. In Mogadishu, the 
soldiers are accommodated in a provisional camp. From there 
they are shipped by German Navy ships to the Kenyan city of 
Mombasa. Some of them will return to Germany from Mombasa as 
early as this Tuesday. The return of the last 250 Bundeswehr 
soldiers is scheduled for 23 March.

  [Text] Munich/Nuremberg -- As the new minister for European 
affairs, Bavaria's Minister President Edmund Stoiber (Christian 
Social Union) wants to urge Bonn to change the Maastricht 
timetable and to set a new course for Europe. The "big 
structural conference," scheduled for 1996, must be held as soon 
as possible, Stoiber stressed in a DPA interview during the 
weekend [26 February]. This is the only way incorrect 
developments concerning the integration process can be corrected 
on a timely basis, he pointed out. Renate Schmidt, chairwoman 
of the Bavarian Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], 
however, accused the Christian Social Union [CSU] of 
marginalizing Bavaria as far as European policies are concerned. 
  Stoiber believes that a transfer of power from Brussels to 
the national states and laender is urgently required. "We must 
exert pressure here." Stoiber has caused a considerable stir in 
the past few months with his criticism of the government's 
European policies. After the forced resignation of Environment 
Minister Peter Gauweiler, he appointed the minister for European 
affairs, Thomas Goppel, as Gauweiler's successor, declaring that 
he himself will take care of European policies in the future. 
  In the DPA interview, Stoiber strongly criticized the 
financial burden that the European Union represents for Germany. 
Thus, at 22 billion German marks, Germany contributed about 70 
percent of the balance of net payers in 1992. In view of a 
nearly 30 percent contribution to the finances of the European 
Union, a return of only 13 percent is not sufficient. Thus, in 
the upcoming financial negotiations, Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
(Christian Democratic Union) must insist on the agreement 
adopted by European Council in 1984. 
  This decision stipulates that "every member state that 
carries too large a budget burden in view of its relative 
prosperity may profit from a correction measure at an 
appropriate time." This topic was not raised on the occasion of 
German reunification so as not to provoke resistance on the part 
of the partners, Stoiber stressed. "It must now be put on the 
agenda." Stoiber accused the European Council of Ministers of 
making decisions "behind closed doors" without sufficient 
democratic legitimation. 
  According to Bavaria's SPD Chairwoman Renate Schmidt, 
Bavaria 
threatens to be marginalized as far as European policies are 
concerned. Instead of vigorously defending the interests of 
Bavaria and Germany at the right time, members of the Bavarian 
government and leading CSU politicians at the federal level are 
misusing the topic to acquire a stronger profile in the election 
campaign, Schmidt criticized.

  [Text] Bonn -- Brazil will support Germany's application 
for a nonpermanent two-year seat on the UN Security Council in 
1995/1996. Brazil Foreign Minister Celso Amorim declared 
Brazilian support during a lengthy exchange of views with 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party of Germany) 
today. In the long run, Germany aspires to a permanent seat on 
the Security Council. The talks that Amorim began at the 
Bundestag this morning focused on economic, technological, and 
environmental cooperation, the Foreign Ministry announced. 
  Both ministers stressed the "excellent state of 
German-Brazilian relations." Kinkel thanked Amorim for his 
support concerning the final control regulation for the 
Brazilian nuclear power plants. He encouraged Brazil to "push 
ahead vigorously" with the ratification of the Tlatelolco 
Treaty, which provides for nuclear-free zones in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. It will "facilitate and widen" technical 
cooperation in the future, Kinkel stressed.

  [Text] Tehran -- Talks on a rescheduling scheme for 
Iranian debts with German companies have been concluded. Iran's 
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi told journalists in Tehran 
today that his country originally should have paid 3 billion 
German marks [DM] by 21 March. During his visit to Bonn this 
week, agreement was reached to repay a total of DM4.5 billion by 
the year 2000, beginning 1996. 
  "This is the most comprehensive agreement Iran has ever 
concluded for rescheduling its foreign debts," Va'ezi stated. 
The deputy foreign minister headed an Iranian delegation that 
paid a three-day visit to Germany. He met with Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel during the visit. 
  According to information from Bonn, Iran is to be granted a 
DM2.5-billion loan by German banks on the basis of commercial 
conditions, which is to be covered by Hermes guarantees. The 
Finance Ministry pointed out Iran's "good values" as far as the 
payment of debts is concerned. The country is currently facing 
liquidity problems because of lower oil prices.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to the Federal Government, 
the Swiss referendum for an "Alpine Initiative" that is supposed 
to transfer transit of goods traffic to railroads beginning in 
2004 considerably complicates the Alpine country's negotiations 
with the European Union (EU). As Bonn's Transportation Ministry 
spokesman Veit Steinle reported on Monday [21 February], transit 
traffic is a European problem. The Federal Government realizes 
Switzerland's special traffic situation, but a purely national 
solution cannot be justified. 
  The Transportation Ministry, however, does not think that 
current transit traffic in Switzerland is endangered by the 
referendum. There is a treaty binding under international law 
according to which truck transit has been guaranteed since 1993 
for another 12 years. However, the EU bodies have to deal soon 
with the result of the referendum, it was stated. 
  Michael Mueller, environmental policy spokesman of the 
Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] Bundestag Group, said the result of the 
Swiss referendum is a victory for ecological reason. The SPD 
Group called on the Federal Government to support the "Alpine 
Initiative" and follow it by reorienting its traffic policy. 
The vote also met with agreement from ecologically oriented 
groups.

  [Excerpts] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday [28 February] 
morning, massive trade union warning strikes caused considerable 
problems in the areas of public transportation and the post in 
some parts of Germany. Apart from North Rhine-Westphalia, the 
job action has focused on Brandenburg, where according to the 
Union of Public Services, Transportation, and Communications 
Workers (OeTV), some 11,000 employees are planning to down tools 
temporarily during the day. 
  Delays for commuters were mainly noticed in North 
Rhine-Westphalia, where railroads and buses remained in their 
garages in numerous cities. In southwestern Germany quite a few 
people also arrived late at work because bus and train drivers 
temporarily suspended work. Public transportation was also 
affected in various parts of the Saarland. In Munich and 
Augsburg, the OeTV strike not only affected public transport but 
also the collection of garbage. 
  The Trade Union of Postal Workers (DPG) also appealed to its 
members to stage token strikes. According to trade union 
sources, several hundred postal workers downed tools in 10 
telecommunication offices, including those of Berlin and 
Hamburg. [passage omitted] 
  With their token strikes, which are scheduled to continue on 
Tuesday, the trade unions want to protest against the "stubborn 
and antisocial position" of the employers in the public sector. 
While the OeTV has called for a 4-percent pay increase, the 
employers presented a "list of cuts." Among other things, extra 
benefits that have hitherto been granted as well as two free 
days are to be cut. The wage talks were suspended without any 
result last week and put off to 9 and 10 March. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- According to calculations by the 
German Economic Research Institute (DIW), economic developments 
in western Germany have slowed down significantly during the 
last six months of the 1993/94 winter. Seasonally adjusted, 
production figures for November and December are the lowest 
figures "of production in the manufacturing industry recorded 
for two consecutive months during this recession," the recent 
weekly report of the Berlin Institute states. 
  According to DIW calculations, the real GDP in the last 
three-months period was 1.5 percent below last years' lowest 
value: "If the stagnation were to prevail at this level 
throughout 1994, the annual result for 1994 would be exactly 0.5 
percent below that of 1993." Yet stagnation is not likely, but 
rather a setback in the first quarter, the report says. 
  As far as orders are concerned, the situation generally 
improved at the end of the year. However, expanded orders, 
which are the result of strong foreign demand, do not compensate 
for weak domestic demand. Domestic orders, which had comprised 
more than two-thirds of the total volume and are of considerably 
greater importance, have decreased. As far as the drop in 
private consumption is concerned there is no compensation either 
from the side of investment, the report states.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- In contrast to western Germany, 
investments in the new laender continue to increase. According 
to calculations of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research 
(Munich), however, the rate of growth is slowing down: In 1992 
investments (including state funds) in the new laender increased 
by about one-third to 119 billion German marks [DM] and in 1993 
by just under 20 percent to DM142 billion, while economic 
researchers predict a 15-percent increase to DM162 billion for 
1994. The impetus is now increasingly coming from the services 
sector, above all apartment rentals and other services, while 
there is a slowdown in the industrial sector, it was stated. 
  The development of investment, which, compared with western 
Germany, is far more expansive in the new laender, resulted in 
investments per inhabitant in eastern Germany that for the first 
time were higher than in the old laender. According to Ifo 
calculations, the difference between approximately DM9,100 per 
inhabitant in the east and DM9,000 in the west in 1993 will 
probably further increase to the advantage of the new laender 
(DM10,350 compared with DM9,300). Divided into sectors, it is 
shown that investments in the sectors of transportation, 
communications, the state, and industry in particular are 
clearly higher than in the west. 
  According to Ifo calculations, it is safe to assume that 
west 
German and foreign enterprises alone invested DM50.5 (last year 
DM42) billion in the new laender in 1993; DM57 billion are 
expected for 1994. In the processing trade the level of the 
previous year will probably not be reached for the first time in 
1994. A relatively vigorous restriction of west German 
investments, which is expected to be partly balanced by the 
increase in foreign commitments, is hidden beneath the slight 
decrease.

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- One out of six Germans willing to 
work will be "affected by underemployment" by the mid-1990's, 
according to the North Rhine-Westphalia Land Labor Office. 
Until then there will be an actual "job gap" for "almost 7 
million persons," Karl Proebsting, president of the Land 
Employment Office, stated in an interview published by the 
Cologne HANDELSMAGAZIN of the Federal Work Group of Medium-Sized 
and Large Retail Trade Companies (BAG). 
  Even under the most favorable economic growth conditions, no 
lasting improvement on the labor market is to be expected for 
the second half of the 1990's. "A consolidation of unemployment 
at an increasingly higher level threatens," he warned. "In 
1995, at the latest, 4 million persons may be unemployed in 
Germany, about 3 million of them in the old laender." In 
addition to this registered unemployment, there is "an enormous 
amount of covert unemployment." On the one hand, it is hidden by 
the use of labor market policy instruments, such as job creation 
measures, qualification, and working short hours; on the other 
hand, more and more people are retreating from the labor market 
because they are discouraged and without prospects.

  [Text] Wiesbaden (DPA) -- In 1993 the wave of bankruptcies 
swept away more than 15,000 companies in Germany. As a result, 
the demands by creditors have almost doubled to about 30 billion 
German marks [DM]. This was announced by the Federal 
Statistical Office in Wiesbaden on Friday [25 February]. 
  In western Germany alone the number of bankruptcies rose by 
30.5 percent to 12,821. Most bankruptcies were registered in 
the service sector, with 3,574 (plus 27.5 percent). Trade was 
also heavily hit, where 3,161 companies (plus 28.7 percent) 
threw in the towel. The highest increase in company 
bankruptcies occurred in the processing industry, with a plus of 
38.4 percent, reaching 2,528 cases. 
  Including the bankruptcies of persons and of decedent's 
estates, there were 17,537 bankruptcies and composition 
proceedings in 1993. Thus, the previous year was exceeded by 
24.2 percent. The damage to the creditors, which amounted to 
DM23.5 billion, was more than twice as high as in 1992 with 
about DM11 billion. Despite the strong increase, the cases of 
bankruptcy and composition proceedings did not reach the record 
levels of 1985 and 1986, when there were about 19,000 cases of 
insolvency and overindebteness each year. 
  In eastern Germany there were applications for total 
execution for 2,327 companies in 1993. The total number of 
insolvencies, 2,761, more than doubled -- rising by 133 percent 
-- compared with 1992. Demands by creditors were fixed at DM5.5 
billion (previous year DM4.3 billion) by the courts.

  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- On Monday evening [21 February], 
after a four-hour debate, the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
congress in Hamburg adopted the principles "For Growth and 
Employment" with a great majority. The proposed measures are to 
safeguard Germany as a business location and increase its 
attractiveness. Essential parts have already been approved by 
the Bonn government coalition and have been presented to 
parliament. 
  Central points of the principles are: the promotion of 
investments; the privatization of tasks that have so far been 
carried out by the sate; the reduction of wages in job-creation 
measures to 80 percent of collectively agreed wages; and the 
restructuring of social benefits wanted by the CDU. In the 
paper, drawn up under the leadership of Environment Minister 
Klaus Toepfer and Christa Thoben, North Rhine-Westphalian 
economic politician, employers and employees are encouraged to 
show their own initiative and independence. Toepfer spoke of a 
cohesive concept that is to abolish "barriers to independence."

  [Text] Bonn -- The leadership of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] started its election campaign for the 
super election year 1994 with a nationwide satellite conference. 
At the SPD headquarters in Bonn, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping 
called on the about 10,000 SPD officials in 27 German towns not 
to rest in view of the current lead that the SPD enjoys over the 
Christian Democratic Union in opinion polls. "We won numerous 
opinion polls in the past few years," he stressed. "Now we 
want to win the Bundestag elections for a change." 
  SPD treasurer Inge Wettig-Danielmeier reported that the SPD 
wants to spend about 70-75 million German marks for the 
Bundestag and European elections this year. SPD manager 
Verheugen called on the party members to wage a fair election 
campaign without "mud slinging." The SPD campaign will focus on 
the safeguarding of jobs and social security. Lower Saxony 
Minister President Gerhard Schroeder, who participated in the 
satellite conference from Hanover, recommended that his friends 
communicate directly with the citizens in the coming election 
campaign, and not through "screens."

  [Text] Paris, 23 February (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime 
Minister Peter Boross on Wednesday [23 February] attended a 
working lunch in the Paris Foreign Ministry and held talks with 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on the prospects of 
Hungary's membership in the European Union. 
  Following the talks, Boross told journalists that Hungary 
counts on France understanding its security policy anxieties. 
He said both countries are interested in furthering economic 
integration, and there have been countless signs of political 
rapprochement between the two countries over the past three 
years. 
  Juppe told journalists he considers Hungarian-French 
relations to be excellent, and added that France wishes to 
assist Hungary's efforts to become part of "the European 
family," where he believes Hungary has a place. 
  He said bilateral cooperation is also going well, though 
there is still room for development. 
  Juppe also said that the Bosnian situation was among the 
topics discussed, and that France fully understands the 
difficulties caused for Hungary by the un embargo. "This is one 
more reason for us to find a solution as soon as possible," he 
said. 
  The Hungarian prime minister next held talks with French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in the Matignon Palace. The 
topics discussed were the Bosnian situation and what is commonly 
called "the Balladur plan." 
  In a brief statement to the press about his East-Central 
European stability program, the French prime minister said 
France will do everything possible to ensure East-Central 
European stability.

  [Text] Paris, 23 February (MTI) -- French President 
Francois Mitterrand received Hungarian Prime Minister Peter 
Boross in the Elysee Palace on Wednesday [23 February] afternoon. 
  In the course of the meeting, which ran 20 minutes longer 
than planned, the French president said Hungary naturally 
belongs to the European organizations, and France will be its 
supporter and partner in the integration process. 
  At a press conference for Hungarian journalists after the 
cordial political discussions, Boross said that, similar to his 
other French negotiation partners, President Mitterrand 
indicated that the senior French political groups hold a 
favorable view of Hungary. 
  Discussions were also held on Hungary's intention to become 
a 
member of the European Union. 
  President Mitterrand called attention to the fact that the 
member countries of the Union "do not particularly like" the 
special demands posed by individual countries. 
  Boross said Hungary has at least five or six such special 
requests. 
  He mentioned the agriculture debate as one of the delicate 
issues of membership. 
  Boross held out the prospect that the government would 
announce a new agricultural program at the end of March.

Hebron Attack"] 
  [Text] Rome, 25 Feb (ANSA) -- The Italian Foreign Ministry 
reported "shock and dismay" on learning of the attack at the 
Hebron mosque, an act it termed "execrable and mad, all the more 
serious because it was carried out in a place of worship." 
  It was an act that "merits the firmest condemnation," the 
Foreign Ministry said in a statement that went on to extend 
condolences to the families of the victims. 
  Italy "expects Israel to adopt all the necessary measures to 
prevent any further bloodshed," the foreign office said. 
  "Greater vigilance and sense of responsibility must prevail 
on all sides in order to ward off the recreation of a vicious 
circle of violence," the statement continued, adding that "the 
madness of extremist fringe groups" could not be allowed to 
jeopardize the peace process. 
  "This tragic episode is part of a series of acts of repeated 
violence, nearly always against innocent civilians, used by 
extremists of all denominations aiming to block the peace 
process," the statement continued, adding that the peace talks, 
"despite all the objective difficulties, are marking important 
steps forward."

  [Text] Rome, 23 Feb (ANSA) -- "The complexity of the 
situation in Bosnia and the entire Yugoslav area cannot allow us 
to lower our guard," said Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta this evening, viewing "with great perplexity" Russian

  "Italy has taken part with great commitment in international

for air action and with the naval patrols and the management of 
the embargo," he said in an official statement. 
  "The truce at Sarajevo is certainly an important success for 
peace action, but it must not make us lose sight of the primary 
need to help the sides to find concrete and lasting solutions 
that respect the many human and political needs of populations 
that have suffered and which face a dim and uncertain future. 
  "That is why the Italian reaction -- preliminary, since 
Yeltsin's ideas have still to be made known -- must be very 
reserved, if not actually negative: the formula proposed by 
Russia excludes Europe, just when the European Union peace plan 
has acquired -- again yesterday at the Bonn meeting with the 
Americans and Russians -- a truly central place in the common 
peace effort. 
  "Even the United Nations, whose legitimacy in the conscience 
of the international community is a basis for the more peaceful 
post-Cold War world, would be excluded from the so-called 
5-nation summit. 
  "It certainly strikes us as negative that Italy was not 
cited 
as one of the participants, but we do not know if the summit 
will take place, given the aforementioned incongruities. Our 
role, and our action for a cause in which we believe, with the 
full support of Parliament and the country, would certainly not 
be diminished by it: but the effectiveness of international 
action would certainly be diminished by a prevalently 
inter-posed, misplaced and hurriedly prepared event, just when 
the hopes of tortured populations were beginning to find some 
concrete elements to express themselves."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Praises Role of Italy and Its </F>
Military"] 
  [Text] Rome, Grosseto (ANSA) -- Italy is playing a leading 
role on the international scene, both with the United Nations 
and NATO, thanks to the dependability of its armed forces and 
for this merits the respect of the international community, 
Italian Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said here on Sunday [20 
February]. 
  Speaking here at ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of 
the entrance of the Italian air force in the war of Liberation, 
Ciampi also said how "All of us, in their place of 
responsibility, are helping Italy along an important path 
towards its political and institutional renewal" and in this 
effort the armed forces are giving their firm and essential 
support "today as fifty years ago when, after the disaster 
brought by the dictatorship, hope was re-born and civil and 
moral reconstruction began, which came first and was more 
important than material reconstruction." 
  Looking at the situation in neighboring Bosnia, the premier 
observed "Italy's role has been essential for the possibility of 
exercising international pressure aimed at halting the horrible 
massacre in Sarajevo and to pave the way for just agreements, 
acceptable for all sides involved." 
  "We are giving to the UN and NATO operations in Bosnia" he 
continued, "the essential contribution of air bases and 
logistical support and command systems. Our presence in the 
international effort to restore peace in the ex-Yugoslavia is 
also in line with all the missions we are involved, under the 
banner of the United Nations: from Somalia to Lebanon, 
Mozambique to the Persian Gulf." 
  Ciampi went on to state how Italy's commitment in 
international missions is linked to a world no longer divided 
into blocs which make it impossible for "isolationist policies" 
and also implies Italy must assume its responsibilities given 
"the difficulties the New World Order in having in establishing 
itself." 
  Italy's position among other nations, Ciampi observed, "also 
depends on its ability to play an active role in operations to 
re-establish and maintain peace in areas where the risks are 
greatest. Among these areas the Mediterranean, not only for us, 
is of central importance. This government has worked in all 
forums for a new security alliance stipulated among the peoples 
of the Mediterranean." 
  The Italian premier went on to recall how, at the last NATO 
summit, he underscored how "the Mediterranean question not only 
regards southern Europe, but the whole Alliance and all of 
Europe." Military alliances and agreements, such as between NATO 
and the Western European Union (WEU) or NATO's Partnerships for 
Peace with East Europe, "must be coupled with greater 
concentration and multilateral cooperation in the Mediterranean 
and a renewed effort against the dangers of the proliferation of 
missiles and weapons of mass destruction." 
  What is needed, Ciampi said, is a "major diplomatic, 
political and economic effort which must continue to seek to 
stabilize the situation in the southern Mediterranean" and in 
this "Italy cannot allow itself to be the egotist short-sighted, 
nor stingy towards peoples distant only a few hundred 
kilometers."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi, Delors on European Growth </F>
Strategy"] 
  [Text] Rome, 18 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo Azgelio 
Ciampi and European Commission President Jacques Delors today 
pushed the latter's White Paper on Growth and Employment as a 
way of addressing Europe's longer-term problems rather than 
relying on short-term monetary management, while stressing the 
need for extending European construction to include the 
countries of the former Eastern bloc. 
  Speaking at an international employment forum organised here 
by the European Social Studies Institute, both men pointed to 
Italy's summer cost-of-labour accord as an example of a more 
flexible and responsible approach to economic policy, while 
Delors highlighted the Volkswagen hour and pay-cutting deal as 
an instance of how employers could pursue socially responsible 
solutions to industrial crisis. 
  Ciampi stressed how national and European problems -- with 
spiralling unemployment to the fore -- were "interpenetrating" 
and how the European Union remained an "indispensable" forum for 
seeking solutions to the recession. 
  He reiterated the importance of monetary and political 
integration within the Twelve, and expansion to include other 
European countries, while Delors called on the Union to "bridge 
the gap" with East Europe -- for which "we are also responsible" 
-- and look at institutional changes with a view to creating a 
future 35-nation Europe. 
  The European Commission President also revealed that he will 
probably attend the March Group of Seven Detroit summit on 
growth and employment, saying that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
was one of the G-7 leaders who was most concerned with 
coordinated strategies to pull the world economy further out of 
recession. 
  Ciampi again hailed the July cost-of-labour accord as an 
achievement that had allowed Italy to peg inflation (making 
"realistic this year's goal of 2.5 percent" and bringing a big 
pay-off in debt servicing costs), cut interest rates, boost 
exports and regain international confidence. He pointed to the 
government's recent employment booster as a way of raising the 
efficiency of social buffers and free up the labour market so as 
to create jobs for young people. 
  Delors also praised the labour accord as an atypical example 
of cooperation "at a time when social dialogue in Europe seems 
to be between deaf persons," while pointing to the Volkswagen 
deal as an important example of "flexibility inside firms." 
  Indicating his White Paper on pan-European communications 
projects, funded by possible European Union bonds, as a way of 
"opening the windows onto the mid term and getting away from a 
day-to-day approach to economic policy," Delors said that 
"budget and monetary policies are not the only elements needed 
to reach full employment." 
  In reference to high unemployment benefit costs -- 80 
percent 
of European spending in job-protection policy -- Delors stressed 
that "we must stop funding idleness and make it an obsession to 
create new work." 
  At the same forum, the vice president of the Italian 
employers' association, Carlo Callieri, pointed to "an 
assessment of instruments of social coordination to allow 
monetary authorities to loosen the noose of interest rates" as 
one of the ways in which competition and employment might be 
reconciled. Callieri called on the present and future 
government to meet pledges on cutting the weight of the public 
sector and reducing the cost of labour, if employment is to be 
boosted. 
  The leaders of Italy's big three trade unions, CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of 
Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], also 
had their say. 
  CGIL leader Bruno Trentin called for talks between the 
government, employers and unions to look at ways in which the 
White Paper could be implemented in Italy. 
  CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni censured the Ciampi government 
for a perceived lack of industrial policy, and called for 
Europe-wide fiscal policies. 
  UIL leader Pietro Larizza said it was "not possible to think 
of a politically and economically united Europe and leave each 
country with separate union policies," and criticised the 
government for alleged lack of action in public works, for which 
"not one lire will be spent this year, even though the projects 
are on the agenda."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy a Leader in Joint Ventures </F>
With Ex-USSR"] 
  [Text] Rome, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- Some 13,000 joint ventures 
have so far been registered in the Soviet Union, and 8,200 of 
these are presently active, according to a survey made last 
October by the Italian publication SISTEMA ITALIA, the weekly of 
the Italian Trade Board and the Milan Chamber of Commerce. 
  The value of these joint ventures has been estimated at 3 
percent of the total industrial production of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States, while the value of joint venture exports 
for the first nine months of 1993 reached 3.2 billion dollars. 
  The main markets are Japan, Germany, Italy and the United 
States. According to SISTEMA ITALIA, foreign investments in 
Russia and other ex-Soviet republics equaled 7 billion dollars 
last fall. Sixty percent of the investors are Russian 
companies, followed by 20 percent who are Italians, and a 
smaller percentage of Austrians, Dutch and Belgians.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta: "Foreign </F>
Policy at the Ballot Box: The Elections, and Italy's Role"] 
  [Text] The election campaign that has just begun in our 
country promises to be very important. It appears that Italy 
finally has the opportunity to become a mature democracy, with 
an electoral system that makes it possible for one homogeneous 
coalition to govern while enabling another to fulfill the role 
of a credible opposition and -- at the next election-- to become 
a possible alternative. One can therefore -- and one should -- 
speak openly about government programs, because it will 
ultimately be the nation -- and no longer the SpA [private 
corporation] of the party secretaries -- that will make the 
decisions. 
  In this connection I feel it is essential to introduce 
foreign policy issues into the debate, not only because of my 
official responsibility (that of encouraging discussion of 
Italian foreign policy and possibly reaching a consensus), but 
also -- and above all -- because despite the fact that the 
international dimension is becoming increasingly important to 
the well-being of our country, discussion of this subject has 
heretofore been imprecise and totally inadequate to the task of 
making the great decisions that lie ahead of us. 
  In particular, Italy must decide whether to stay the course 
on which it has already embarked -- that of fulfilling its 
responsibilities and making its contribution to the construction 
and maintenance of a "new world order" -- or to change course in 
the direction of an improbable unilateralism (as the right would 
wish) or an imprudent neutralism (as some on the left would 
wish). The various forces that aspire to govern the nation 
should therefore propose explicit solutions to these dilemmas 
and discuss their proposals among themselves in an effort to 
reach an appropriate consensus in this regard. 
  I believe that a stable and well-ordered international 
environment is undeniably necessary if we are to successfully 
exploit the great opportunities opened up by the defeat of the 
Soviet threat. If abandoned to anarchy, the great processes that 
could finally bring us a universal family of nations -- in which 
war would be a rare exception rather than the rule -- might 
instead break down, with disastrous consequences for those 
concerned and for the entire world community. 
  1. The development of democracy and of the free market has 
enabled many countries to be emancipated in terms of their 
freedom and well-being. It has, however, also increased the 
vulnerability of modern and complex societies to transnational 
processes over which the individual governments have little 
control (narcotics, terrorism, migrations, economic crises, and 
the environment). 
  2. The integrative forces of the markets have given rise to 
a 
welcome integration (and consequent rationalization) of diverse 
economies whereby even industrialized countries are united with 
developing countries, as in the case of NAFTA. If, however, this 
process is not supported by a parallel development of the global 
economy through the GATT, it could lead to a harmful division 
of the world into spheres of mutually antagonistic economic 
powers -- a situation that would have a potentially 
counterproductive impact on the world economy as well as 
dangerous political repercussions and the inevitable exclusion 
of the poorer countries. 
  3. Because it serves as an important instrument for 
mobilization and socialization, the rediscovery of national 
identity has revitalized many countries that were formerly 
enslaved by dictatorship and poverty. An exacerbated 
nationalism, however, could lead (and in some cases has already 
led) to intolerant and discriminatory political practices that 
have consequences of a manifestly conflictual nature. This is 
especially true in the youngest democracies (such as those 
created following the collapse of the communist empire), in 
which the actual capacity for reform is not adequate to fulfill 
the ever growing expectations of societies that have been 
waiting all too long. 
  4. Lastly, it is undeniable that nuclear weapons -- despite 
their diabolical capacity for destruction -- had a stabilizing 
effect on relations among great powers, because governments 
found the very possession of such weapons to be reassuring. The 
proliferation of the weapons of mass destruction, however, 
threatens to upset this process. If even weak, illegitimate, 
paranoid, vulnerable, and nonsocialized governments within the 
family of nations are able to possess the immense power of 
nuclear weapons, then international order cannot prevail and we 
shall all lapse into an anarchic nightmare in which any 
megalomaniac dictator will be able to keep the entire 
international community at bay. 
  An international order capable of ensuring that these 
processes will not break down is therefore a basic prerequisite 
for bringing prosperity and peace to the people. It is 
accordingly in our interest -- and it is also our duty -- to 
contribute to the creation of that stability. Italian 
politicians, however, are not always clear as to the means 
necessary to make that contribution. A generic profession of 
faith in the international organization that is currently most 
favored or most in vogue will not suffice. 
  International organizations are in fact not sufficiently 
developed to solve -- by themselves -- the problems confronting 
us, although governments often make them scapegoats in an effort 
to avoid their own responsibilities. International organizations 
do in fact play an essential role, in that they provide the 
individual nations with a forum for making collective decisions 
-- thereby legitimizing possible international action -- but 
they do not affect the implementation of such decisions, which 
today -- rightly or wrongly -- is the responsibility of 
individual governments. Only individual governments (especially 
the democratic governments) can decide whether the lives of 
their soldiers should be put at risk. 
  The international organizations -- such as the UN and the 
CSCE -- have therefore not eroded the sovereignty of individual 
states sufficiently to be able to develop their own independent 
means for implementing decisions. Proof of this is the fact that 
these organizations have been unable to equip themselves with 
the decisionmaking mechanisms that would overcome the one state, 
one vote rule (which in the case of the CSCE is actually one 
state, one veto) so that the actions taken by these 
organizations could be more in accordance with the relative 
proportions of the individual contributions made to their common 
goal. Moreover, even when the international organizations are 
not stymied by the obstructionism of one or more states that are 
driven by selfish and unilateral motivations, they can sometimes 
be genuinely hesitant when they have to base their action on 
contradictory principles: for example, having to choose between 
the principle of the inviolability of national borders and the 
principle of the self-determination of peoples. You cannot, 
therefore, have a clear conscience merely by declaring that you 
are in favor of action by the UN if you are not prepared to pay 
the physical and moral costs of carrying out that action and are 
not prepared to carry out strong political intervention if the 
UN organization in question is stalemated. 
  Italy cannot, of course, accomplish this unilaterally, but 
the De Gasperian perception of an Italy that is European and 
Western -- a perception that many would like to disregard now 
that the Berlin Wall has fallen -- takes on renewed significance 
in this context. Only the European and Atlantic West has the 
resources necessary to support the decisions of the 
international community; and only the European and Atlantic West 
is motivated by political objectives that a great part of the 
world recognizes as appropriate, that is to say, the 
consolidation of democracy and freedom. 
  The anti-Western and Third World interpretation of the 
purpose of the UN -- an interpretation shared by much of the 
Italian left (which is still operating in accordance with the 
models of the Cold War) -- disregards the identity of interests 
between the UN and the Western nations and therefore runs 
counter to the interests both of the UN and of Italy itself, 
which would be isolated if it followed such a policy. Together 
with its partners [preceding word in English], Italy must 
therefore support decisions that will make it possible to carry 
out the work of the international organizations. 
  First of all, this means maintaining national unity (the 
constituent parts of a confederation would in fact be too weak 
to make their point of view prevail in the international arena) 
and taking a decisive stand in favor of the creation of a 
European Union that would have the political capacity to 
mobilize the resources it needs to contribute -- together with 
its allies -- to the construction of a new world order. 
  Second, this means accepting responsibilities, and not all 
of 
the would-be government leaders have been explicit on this 
subject. We live in an imperfect world that has been rendered 
even more imperfect by the uncertainties of the transition 
through which we are passing. If we wish to make our 
contribution to the kind of world order that would be capable of 
defending our interests, promoting peace and development, and 
complying with our vision of justice, we must have a clear 
understanding of the bold effort necessary to meet these 
responsibilities. Indeed, not only must we prepare to defend 
ourselves from an unlikely direct threat; we must also be ready 
-- in terms of material and moral resources -- to intervene in 
areas of the world where human and civil rights are violated, in 
confirmation of the right to carry out humanitarian intervention 
with the aim of protecting all human beings, even those who have 
had the misfortune to be born in the wrong country. 
  If we wish to reassure all peoples and guarantee them the 
stability necessary for their development, we must be available 
to intervene in difficult situations by all means necessary 
(including military means, just as the police ensure public 
order within the individual states), with all the risks that 
this entails. We must therefore be ready to defend our interests 
(as was the case during the Cold War) and to carry out the UN's 
humanitarian missions (as in Somalia and Mozambique). We must 
also, however, be prepared to cope with situations which -- 
although risky in military terms -- do not affect our vital 
interests in a way that would make the need for intervention 
self-evident. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall we have twice 
found ourselves in a similar situation: in the Gulf and in 
Bosnia. The Gulf War demonstrated that such interventions by the 
international community are possible, and Bosnia has 
demonstrated that they are not easy to carry out. 
  These problems are of the greatest importance, inasmuch as 
they involve our nation's security for the next generation. It 
is therefore worthwhile for the various political forces to let 
the Italian people know their views on these questions even 
before the elections, in order to give our citizens the 
opportunity to base their vote on these opinions concerning such 
important issues, among others. From this standpoint, the 
newborn Pact for Italy's decision to exclude the MSI [Italian 
Social Movement] forces of the right -- who have always been 
opposed to the concept of a Western-oriented Italy -- is, I 
believe, a wise one, as well as its wait-and-see attitude toward 
the Lega, some of whose representatives seem to be calling for 
an Italy divided into three parts that would not be equal to the 
tasks that I have discussed. As for the other side of the 
political spectrum, I believe the Left may have difficulty 
expressing itself in a coherent manner. Whereas the Democratic 
Alliance appears to be ready to discharge these 
responsibilities, the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] seems 
to me to be more irresolute, midway through its transition from 
old conditioned reflexes (that led it to oppose the Gulf 
operation) to a new culture of government. As for the extreme 
left (Rete, Communist Renewal, and the Greens), it is light 
years distant from the kind of attitude called for under the 
current situation. In any case, I do not believe it likely that 
before the elections the "coalition of the forces of the left" 
will succeed in resolving these contradictions. If it does, 
however -- and that would be desirable -- it would be at the 
cost of a schism within the coalition and a clarifying 
separation of groups and personalities whose conceptions of the 
world are not easily reconciled.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Spadolini Sees Problems for Next </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (ANSA) -- The Italian parliament 
which will be elected March 27 and 28 will have difficulty is 
sustaining a stable government but the drive to restore and 
reinforce the rapport between the political class and the people 
is irreversible, visiting Italian Senate Speaker Giovanni 
Spadolini said here Monday [21 February]. 
  During the press conference which capped his visit, 
Spadolini 
observed "there was the aim to reduce the number of parties, but 
the decision to leave a twenty-five percent share of seats to be 
elected by the proportional system will not simplify the 
position of parties, at least in the next parliament." 
  Nevertheless, the Senate speaker added, the winner-take-all 
constituencies will increase contact between the elected and the 
electors and a candidate will more likely be judged by his 
record, experience and political clout. 
  Turning his attention to the political kickbacks scandal in 
Italy, Spadolini underscored how "this painful affair has shown 
how Italian democracy has the strength to cleanse the errors 
made over past years." 
  The moral question, he added, "...has returned to the center 
of the political life. I had made it the basis of my government 
twelve years ago. I can say now that I was long-sighted and I 
am sure that it will mark the political life in the coming 
years."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poll on Berlusconi, Popularity </F>
Ratings"] 
  [Text] Milan, 23 Feb (ANSA) -- The majority of Italians 
defined media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, who has created his own 
Go Italy [Forza Italia] party, as a conservative and gave him 
positive marks in a poll released Wednesday [24 February] by the 
Directa institute. 
  The poll, taken between February 19 and 21 with 1,002 phone 
interviews in 76 municipalities, showed that 50.2 percent of 
those interviewed considered Berlusconi a right-wing candidate, 
while 33.2 percent described him as belonging to the center; 4.8 
percent said he was left-wing and 11.8 percent had no opinion. 
  In response to another question, 59.1 percent of those 
interviewed said Berlusconi, if elected, would not pose a danger 
to democracy, while 33.4 percent said he would and 7.5 percent 
did not reply. 
  As for generic "positive" or "negative" views of the man, 
59.3 percent said they felt positive about Berlusconi (of whom 
14.08 percent felt "very" positive and 45.3 percent "moderately" 
positive), while 36.2 percent expressed a negative vote and 4.5 
percent gave no reply. 
  In the ratings of those who are viewed positively and 
negatively, anti-corruption magistrate Antonio Di Pietro topped 
the positive poll with 94.8 percent, while former Socialist 
Party leader Bettino Craxi won the negative ratings with 95.1 
percent. 
  The positive ratings showed Berlusconi in second place with 
59.3 percent, followed by neo-Fascist National Alliance leader 
Gianfranco Fini (43.4 percent), Pact for Italy leader Mario 
Segni (39.8 percent), People's Party [Italian Popular Party] 
leader Mino Martinazzoli (38.2 percent) and Democratic Party of 
the Left leader Achille Occhetto (36.6 percent). Surprisingly, 
Northern League leader Umberto Bossi only obtained seventh 
place, with 24.3 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Opinion Poll Shows 60 Percent of </F>
Italians Are Undecided"] 
  [Text] Turin -- Who will win the elections? It is 
impossible to say at present, given the very high proportion of 
those who are undecided, with confusion reigning supreme. This 
is the conclusion reached by the ITER social research center, 
which conducted a survey on the attitudes of Italians just over 
a month from the election date. No winners or losers emerge 
from the investigation. "We were not aiming to carry out an 
electoral survey," explained ITER Director Bruno Babando, "in 
the first place because we believe such surveys are unreliable. 
We preferred to analyze the issues and problems --as perceived 
by Italians -- which will have to be addressed by our new 
representatives." 
  It is apparent from the survey -- conducted on a 
representative sample of Italy's population (1,426 interviews) 
-- that confusion and uncertainty still prevail among the 
voters. In fact, over 79 percent say they find the present 
political situation confusing, and no less than 58 percent say 
they have not yet decided whom to vote for. Furthermore, 56 
percent state that in the upcoming elections the candidates' 
personality will be more important than their party allegiance. 
In this respect, electors showed that they had fully understood 
and correctly assessed the changes introduced through the new 
uninominal system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Majority Want Mammi' Law Changed, </F>
Poll Says"] 
  [Text] Milan, 22 Feb (ANSA) -- A majority of Italians want 
to repeal a controversial 1988 broadcasting law which took the 
name of then posts minister Oscar Mammi', according to a Directa 
telephone poll of over 1,000 people taken on February 19-21 in 
76 small, middling and large Italian towns. 
  Posed the question "if there was a referendum to abrogate 
the 
Mammi' law which assigns three TV networks to Silvio 
Berlusconi's group, would you vote to abrogate it or not to 
abrogate it?," 56.4 percent of the sample said they were 
pro-repeal and 43.6 percent anti-repeal. 6.4 percent expressed 
no preference. 
  Directa said the most pro-repeal were males in general (57.3 
percent), 35-to-54-year-olds, and inhabitants of northern and 
central Italy (58.3 percent). 
  It added that the sample is representative of the adult 
population in terms of geographical area, sex, age, and socio- 
professional class. The maximum statistical margin of error was 
estimated at 4 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondents Carmen Parra and Javier Rivas] </F>
  [Text] Parliamentarians in People's Party [PP] and 
Convergence and Union [CiU] have divided up the task of 
promoting, albeit in softened form, some of the main CEOE 
[Spanish Employers Association] proposals on labor reform. The 
PP has tabled an amendment that would open the way to 
eliminating prior administrative authorization for dismissals. 
The Catalonian group, meanwhile, may introduce in the Senate a 
new intermediate category--"technically wrongful 
dismissal"--coinciding with a proposal from the employers' 
confederation. This measure is intended to lower employer costs 
associated with individual dismissals. The various parliamentary 
groups have presented a total of more than 500 amendments to the 
three legislative bills comprising the labor reform. 
  Of the hundred or so amendments whose passage the PP group 
will advocate, the one with the greatest impact on flexibility 
in dismissals is embodied in a proposed change to the Statute on 
Workers. The PP wants all provisions pertaining to collective 
dismissals, temporary contract suspensions, and workweek 
reductions to be taken out of that statute and regulated instead 
by interconfederal accords--of all economic sectors--between 
management and labor. The amendment provides for "said accords 
to be adapted to community norms," which would in fact imply 
elimination of prior administrative authorization. 
  The PP also wants--and in this it agrees with CiU--to 
eliminate automatic renewal of labor-management agreements, 
though it would leave in its place an eight-month extension to 
allow time for employers and workers to negotiate a new pact. 
CEOE opposes automatic renewal on grounds it produces 
"hyperemployment." 
  Regarding dismissals, the PP group came up with a whole 
series of alternative amendments based on their own ideas and 
the employers' proposals. The initiatives ranged from minor to 
radical. It was Jose Maria Aznar himself, leader of the PP, who 
on bringing to a close the period for introducing amendments 
Tuesday afternoon [15 February] opted for a middle-of-the-road 
position, according to PP sources. 
  CiU is going to wait for the Senate debate before deciding 
whether to present an amendment to create a new category of 
individual dismissal: "technically wrongful." Employees whose 
dismissal falls into this category, which covers layoffs of 
between one and nine workers, would be given less severance than 
the 45 days' pay for each year on the job that is currently paid 
in "wrongful dismissal" cases. 
  The same category is also proposed in a thick CEOE document 
titled "Amendments to the Reform of the Statute on Workers," a 
collection of initiatives which employers have submitted to 
several Congressional groups. 
  Miquel Roca, spokesman for the Catalonian group, alluded to 
this dismissal category last Tuesday, but his group decided to 
postpone its possible introduction until negotiations in the 
Senate are under way because, as CiU deputy Rafael Hinojosa said 
yesterday, "it's a controversial measure and needs more time to 
ripen." Parliamentary sources note that the PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] and IU [United Left] together have 
enough votes to defeat the amendment in the Congress, though not 
in the upper house. Carlos Solchaga, head of the Socialist 
group, said on Tuesday that "in principle" the PSOE does not 
support the Convergence amendment. 
  For the most part IU, the group that tabled the largest 
number of amendments--210--defended the proposals of organized 
labor. The group has asked that the leaders of the two largest 
labor centrals--Nicolas Redondo and Antonio Gutierrez--and the 
secretaries general of the European Trade Union Confederation 
and the CIOSL [expansion unknown]--Emilio Gabaglio and Enzo 
Friso respectively--be asked to testify before Congress prior to 
committee deliberations on the bill. 
  IU-IC [United Left-Catalonian Initiative] deputy Ricardo 
Peralta publicly offered to engage the socialists in a dialogue 
on the amendments of both groups, so that the reform will enjoy 
the "consensus support of labor's representatives who will have 
to administer it." The IU has justified almost all its 
amendments on grounds they represent "technical improvements," a 
formal bow to the PSOE, since the socialists have said they 
would consider only "technical" changes to their labor reform 
legislation. 
<H5>  [Box p 15] </H5>
<H5>  Amendments to Labor Reform Legislation </H5>
<H5>  Dismissals: </H5>

  -  Government: Eliminate administrative 
authorization for individual dismissals, i.e., those affecting 
fewer than 10 percent of enterprise personnel in a 3-month 
period. Individual dismissals to remain subject to judicial 
review. Allowable grounds for dismissal to be expanded to 
include organizational or production-related improvements. 
  -  PSOE: 
Specify that economic grounds apply when dismissals help the 
enterprise cut losses, while technological, organizational, and 
production-related grounds refer to efforts to increase 
profits. 
  -  PP: Issues regarding dismissals, relocations, and 
employment adjustment procedures to be decided by 
interconfederal accords between employers and unions, with such 
accords taking account of community norms (i.e., elimination of 
prior administrative authorization). 
  -  CiU: No amendments to be 
presented in the lower house. In the Senate, it may propose a 
new category of dismissal that is less costly to the employer 
than "wrongful." 
  -  IU: Wants to keep the terms now in effect, but 
believes collective layoff provisions should apply to dismissals 
affecting 5 percent of enterprise personnel. No expansion of 
grounds for dismissal. 
<H5>  Apprenticeship Contracts: </H5>

  -  Government: Designed for 
young workers ages 16 to 25 and for a maximum of three years. 
First-year pay equal to 70 percent of the minimum wage. Does not 
carry unemployment benefits or eligibility for temporary 
disability. 
  -  PSOE: Recognize the right to paid maternity leave. 
Enact controls to ensure companies cannot put already-employed 
workers into apprenticeship slots doing the same work. Training 
contracts not convertible into apprenticeship contracts. 
  -  PP: 
Bring the age limit down to 21. Guarantee that youth in the 
program will get vocational training. Prohibit workers from 
receiving such contracts with more than one enterprise. 
Contracts for youths aged 21-26 to carry reduced [employer] 
taxes. 
  -  CiU: Agrees with amendments proposed by the PSOE. 
Training time theoretically reducible on presentation of proof 
of completion of vocational training courses. In such cases, the 
employee would be entitled to a higher wage. 
  -  IU: Lower the age 
limit to 20 and the maximum contract duration to two years. The 
reference wage to be the pay rate currently in effect in the 
enterprise or sector, not the minimum wage. Full social welfare 
benefits. 
<H5>  Employment Offices: </H5>

  -  Government: INEM [National 
Employment Institute] to lose its monopoly on employment 
services. Legalize nonprofit private placement agencies and 
temporary-hire agencies. 
  -  PSOE: Workers transferred illegally by 
private agencies to acquire permanent status. Equality of access 
to employment guaranteed, and no discrimination permitted for 
any reason. 
  -  PP: Legalization of such offices to be the subject 
of a separate law to be passed within one year. Elimination of 
those proposed by the government. 
  -  CiU: None. 
  -  IU: Such 
enterprises to be judged incompatible with the framework of the 
Spanish labor system. INEM to continue exercising its past 
monopoly in the field of labor-market intermediation. 
<H3>  Union 
Elections: </H3>

  -  Government: The language in the bill has the 
agreement of UGT [General Union of Workers] and CCOO [Workers 
Commissions]. Election process not to be restricted to a 
specific time period. Representational strength of the 
respective unions may be measured at any time using data from a 
permanent election register maintained by the enterprise 
committees. 
  -  PSOE: No amendments tabled on this subject. 
  -  PP: To 
be worked out in separate legislation. Creation of a central 
register. Representational strength of the respective unions to 
be evaluated on the basis of results obtained over a six-month 
period. Results to be made public every four years. 
  -  CiU: The 
Catalonian coalition flatly rejects the union election reform 
and deplores the fact that the ideas proposed by the minority 
trade unions are being ignored. 
  -  IU: No amendments tabled on this 
subject. 
<H5>  Miscellaneous Issues: </H5>

  -  Government: Eliminate requirement 
for administrative authorization of geographic relocations. 
Eliminate the nine-hour limit on workdays for day-laborers, and 
allow weekly days off to be noncontiguous. 
  -  PSOE: Geographic 
relocation and modification of contract terms to be deemed 
justified where they contribute to improving enterprises' profit 
position or competitiveness. 
  -  PP: Enterprises with more than 50 
workers facing "employment adjustment" must enact a social plan 
to retrain the individuals laid off, especially those 46 years 
of age and older. Employers to be exempted from making Social 
Security payments for one year on any unemployed person hired as 
a permanent employee. A 50 percent reduction in employer Social 
Security taxe for 18 months for each temporary hire converted to 
a permanent position. 
  -  CiU: Eliminate automatic renewal of 
labor-management pacts. Employment of handicapped workers, and 
contracts pertaining to them, to remain outside the scope of 
this reform. 
  -  IU: End special contracts for employment 
stimulation and launching of new businesses. Strengthen written 
contracts by authorizing union monitoring of same. Reestablish 
principle of "reasonable cause" with respect to temporary hires. 
Accepts flexibility on labor contracts and collective 
negotiations, but not on dismissals.

  [Text] Neither the Socialist parliamentary group nor 
Convergence and Union will support amendments to the labor 
reform act proposed by the trade unions, because they realize 
those changes would affect the substance of the government 
legislation. UGT and CCOO have found sympathetic listeners only 
in the IU, Catalonian Initiative, Canaries Coalition, and PNV 
[Basque Nationalist Party]. The PP is taking a 
middle-of-the-road position; it will argue for some changes in 
apprenticeship contracts, but nothing substantial with respect 
to dismissals or relocation. 
  Francisco Arnau for the Socialist Party and Miquel Roca of 
the CiU yesterday limited themselves to hearing proposals from 
the labor centrals contained in a 54-page document. The 
amendments which the two groups presented yesterday, the last 
day for doing so, are "technical improvements." The most 
important of them would recognize the right to paid maternity 
leave for apprentice employees. A change supported by 
practically all the groups, it would also remove a conflict 
between the language of the government bill and a recommendation 
of the International Labor Organization (ILO). 
  Union officials were visibly disappointed after their 
meetings with the PSOE and CiU. Jose Maria Fidalgo of CCOO said 
the unions were most upset by the fact that the government has 
proposed to debate the labor reform bills as an "urgent matter," 
which in his opinion will make it more difficult for 
negotiations to be pursued in a calm and orderly fashion. "The 
government had told us parliament would be a good forum for 
continuing the dialogue, but now they're sending it through 
under fast-track procedures," he said. 
  Despite this, PP deputy Celia Villalobos has promised the 
unions to continue the dialogue, while the bills work their way 
through the legislative process, to see if consensus can be 
reached to allow presentation of compromise ("in voce") 
amendments. For the moment, the PP is in agreement with CCOO and 
UGT about correcting several features of apprenticeship 
contracts: reducing the upper age limit from 25 to 21, linking 
this type of contract to vocational training requirements to 
guarantee that training occurs, and stipulating that a youth 
cannot be employed as an apprentice after completing his 
training as an apprentice. It will also present an amendment to 
"employment adjustment" procedures locking in the employers' 
commitment to devise "social plans." Its purpose is to retrain 
laid off workers, especially those 46 and older. 
<H5>  Reasonable Demands </H5>
  The PNV views some of the union demands as reasonable and is 
going to consider them. It favors maintaining the requirement 
for prior administrative authorization in collective layoffs, 
but only if the percentage of company work force affected is 
less than the 10 percent figure set by the government. Nor does 
it support new grounds for dismissal--organizational and 
production-related--"because this gives the companies carte 
blanche for layoffs," according to Emilio Olabarria. The Basque 
group is not asking to lower the age ceiling for apprentices but 
argues that they should not be paid less than the minimum wage, 
whereas the government bill provides for hiring them at 70 
percent of the minimum wage. 
  The CiU group will also continue dialoguing with the unions 
to see if some agreement can be reached that "does not decrease 
the value of the reform, which we support," said Miquel Roca 
yesterday. CiU will argue for "technical improvements" and has 
proposed to PSOE the introduction of a new dismissal category 
falling between "wrongful dismissal"--which must be indemnified 
with severance equaling 45 days's pay for each year worked--and 
"disciplinary dismissal" requiring no indemnification. The new 
category, should it be created, would carry an intermediate 
level of severance pay. 
  The Socialist Party, as expected, presented no substantial 
amendments yesterday. Francisco Arnau said that "the reform is 
on the right track, and the PSOE is going to continue to defend 
it."

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] British forces in Bosnia were today placed on a 
heightened state of alert following the shooting down of four 
Serb aircraft by American warplanes. 
  Military sources described the move as a "sensible 
precaution 
in the light of current circumstances." 
  Work was continuing as normal both on the ground and in the 
air, officials said. 
  There were no British warplanes in the area at the time U.S. 
F-16 Fighting Falcons shot down four Bosnian Serb Galeb attack 
aircraft. 
  The U.S. aircraft, equipped with Sidewinder air-to-air 
missiles, spotted six Galebs in the air close to Banja Luka in 
direct contravention of the UN resolution banning all flights 
over Bosnia. 
  The American pilots ordered the Serb planes to land or be 
shot down. They ignored the warning and four were destroyed. 
  Britain has six Sea Harrier jump-jets, eight Tornado F-3 
fighters and 12 Jaguar strike aircraft flying regular patrols 
over Bosnia. 
  But the Ministry of Defence in London said none were in the 
immediate area when the attack took place. 
  A spokesman said: "Operations are continuing today as 
normal. 
This was a very good example of NATO action in enforcement of a 
UN resolution." 
  Allied aircraft on patrols over Bosnia stay above 10,000ft 
to 
avoid anti-aircraft artillery. 
  The Bosnian Serb forces possess a variety of anti-aircraft 
missiles, including heat-seeking systems.

<F P=106> [Statement by Federal Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on the </F>
shooting down of four Serbian aircraft by U.S. jets in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina; in Brussels on 28 February -- recorded] 
  [Text] If events have occurred as they have been reported, 
it shows that monitoring the compliance with UN Security Council 
resolutions is now being taken seriously, and it would also show 
the Serbian side that such violations of the no-fly zone will no 
longer be tolerated. Of course, this would be the first NATO 
mission, if I see things correctly; but I do not think that it 
will lead to further such missions. [sentence as heard] It is, 
above all, also a mission that has to be seen separately from 
the measures that have been planned in and around Sarajevo, and 
all those -- at least theoretical -- deliberations as to whether 
what was stated in connection with the NATO Sarajevo ultimatum 
could also be applied to Tuzla and other comparable areas.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
correspondent Udo van Kampen in Brussels on 28 February -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Van Kampen] A few moments ago I had a chance to get 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's first reaction to this first 
NATO military strike. 
  [Kinkel] This is indeed the first NATO strike of this kind 
which shows that if peaceful political solutions are not brought 
about then we will get serious with what we have decided upon. 
  [Van Kampen] Isn't there now the threat that the conflict 
will escalate? 
  [Kinkel] No, I don't think so. Rather, I think that if it 
was the Serb side, it will now be clear to those involved that 
it is a serious matter when the security measures set by the 
Security Council -- in this case the no-fly zone -- are violated. 
  [Van Kampen] If the Serbs retaliate, will NATO continue to 
act consistently? 
  [Kinkel] I am not responsible for NATO decisions, but I 
cannot imagine that the Serbs will retaliate. First we have to 
look at what took place and I assume that all the details will 
come to light soon. 
  [Van Kampen] Were German crews involved in the so-called 
AWACS flights, the reconnaissance flights? 
  [Kinkel] That is still being looked into at the moment. I 
can't tell you that for sure yet. If they were involved, it 
will have been within the framework of their mission which was 
approved by the Federal Constitutional Court. 
  [Van Kampen] Do you assume, or have you already been in 
touch 
and know, that the Russians approve of this mission? 
  [Kinkel] No. I haven't had sufficient time to do that yet, 
but I've instructed the office in Bonn to make all sorts of 
inquiries and as soon as I have more news I will be happy to 
tell you. 
  [Van Kampen] The Russians did support Security Council 
Resolution 816 when it was made. 
  [Kinkel] Yes, of course. They knew that things could get 
serious in a case such as this if an unpermitted violation of 
the no-fly zone took place and this is evidently what happened 
here. It has been said -- and I am not in a position to confirm 
this either because I don't know -- that the planes either 
attacked a munition factory beforehand or intended to attack it.

demonstrated its resolve not to let the budding peace process be 
destroyed, according to Social Democratic Party [SPD] leader 
Hans- Ulrich Klose. Klose said in Bonn today that the SPD 
welcomed and supported the no-fly zone imposed by the UN. The 
SPD hopes that consistent compliance with UN resolutions will be 
taken seriously by all Bosnian parties, thus improving the 
possibility of political solutions, Klose said.

  [Text] The introduction of the cease-fire in Bosnia has 
brought about the creation of a mixed brigade of UN forces, 
which the Spanish battalion will join. The brigade initially 
will be commanded by a British general and will also include 
Canadian, British, and Malaysian troops. Its essential mission 
will be to reopen the River Neretva route.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled news bulletin--read by unidentified announcer] </F>
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, good morning. We interrupt 
our regular programing to report some urgent news on Bosnia. 
This morning between 0630 and 0700 [0430-0500 GMT], four 
Yugoslav Galeb aircraft were shot down by two U.S. F-16's. This 
was announced a short time ago by YEETHA [National Defense 
General Staff] Chief Admiral Khristos Limberis. The report was 
confirmed just a few minutes ago in a REUTER dispatch from NATO 
headquarters in Brussels. The news item from NATO is very brief. 
It reads: NATO has announced that four planes were shot down 
by U.S. aircraft. According to Admiral Limberis, the Galeb 
planes are two-seater training craft similar to the T-33. They 
can, however, be easily transformed into fighters. These planes 
were flying over Bosnia-Herzegovina in the zone that is 
restricted according to the UN resolution, 50 miles southeast of 
Banja Luka. News agency dispaches mention nothing more and 
offer no other information from Yugoslavia. 
  We now have correspondent Stefanos Kasimatis on the 
telephone 
line from the Ministry of National Defense: 
  [Kasimatis] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis has 
just completed a statement on the situation. His first comment 
concerned the downing of four Galeb-type planes that belong to 
the Serb Air Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This unfortunate 
incident confirms the correctness of the Greek position against 
any direct or indirect engagement by any Balkan country in the 
Bosnian crisis. 
  The minister also noted that what impressed him was that the 
four planes shot down were mainly training aircraft. But 
Admiral Limberis, who interrupted his meeting with British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, noted that these planes are 
easily transformed into fighter craft. Arsenis said they were 
informed of the incident by NATO headquarters in Naples and the 
British Embassy during the meeting with Hurd. There has been no 
other Greek reaction and the Greek side is waiting for 
developments. 
  Answering a correspondent's question, Arsenis clarified that 
the Greek military personnel in Bosnia, who number about 100, 
are there within the framework of a European Union initiative, 
not a NATO one, so there is no possibility of Greece becoming 
involved. He reiterated the firm Greek position against 
engaging in the crisis in Bosnia. This is the news from the 
Ministry of National Defense.

  [Text] Paris, Feb 25 (TANJUG) -- Paris, Washington and 
Moscow have fully agreed that "diplomatic contacts be 
intensified" for the soonest possible negotiated settlement in 
the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the French 
Foreign Ministry said on Friday [25 February]. 
  The three parties were also completely agreed as to the 
latest initiatives for the resolution of the Bosnian conflict, 
said ministry spokesman Richard Duque. He said this in 
announcing that Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Thursday night 
talked on the telephone with U.S. State Secertary Warren 
Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. 
  The spokesman, however, said nothing about France's proposal 
for the U.N. to carry a resolution to place Sarajevo under U.N. 
administration. 
  French media assert this proposal will not easily pass the 
U.N. Security Council, knowing that Moscow apparently disfavours 
it while Washington has not yet made up its mind.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Ambassador 'Abdallah 'Abdallah and </F>
Israeli Ambassador David Sason by unidentified correspondent; in 
Athens on 25 February -- in English with Greek subtitles] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Ambassador, Greece now holds the 
presidency of the European Union. What can it do to help the 
Palestinian people after such a sad event? 
  ['Abdallah] Greece, as the president of the European Union, 
must press hard for the international protection of Palestinians 
and the occupied areas in the face of the Israeli aggression, 
official and by the settlers. Second, Greece, as president of 
the European Union, can also press for the immediate 
implementation of the Declaration of Principles and immediate 
withdrawal of Israeli forces and a dismantlement of the 
settlements which are time bombs that threaten both Israelis and 
Palestinians alike. 
  [Correspondent] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias is going 
to visit the Middle East next week. What does he have to say to 
the Israelis? 
  ['Abdallah] I hope he will tell them that Israel cannot work 
for peace and at the same time arm its settlers to murder 
Palestinians. This is against peace and not the way that would 
bring about tranquility and stability in the region. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Ambassador, yesterday you were telling 
us 
that Greece can contribute a lot to the peace process. Now, 
after such a sad event, what can we do? 
  [Sason] Well, I do believe that Greece, like all the other 
countries in the world, can contribute by convincing the Arab 
people, the extremists and the Palestinian themselves to reduce 
the tension. To understand that this is the act of a saboteur, 
an extremist one. That it is not something that was planned, 
guided by the State of Israel. It was an act that was done in 
order to provoke the peace process. So, all of us are almost 
obliged to try to reduce the terminology, to try and to speak in 
minor tones, about this incident, which is a very sad one.

  [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in 
Seville this morning that after the massacre of 58 Palestinians 
on 25 February in a mosque in Hebron, the Spanish Government is 
shocked and Felipe Gonzalez has sent a telegram to the 
Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to express to him the sorrow of 
the Spanish Government. 
  The minister stressed that right now it is essential for the 
Washington agreements on the autonomy of occupied territorities 
to come into operation as soon as possible. Solana was 
confident that in spite of this catastrophe the peace process 
will not be slowed down but, on the contrary, speeded up. 
  Javier Solana recalled that Spain is committed to the Middle 
East peace process. He added that there is no decision in the 
direction of UN troops going to the occupied territories and he 
mentioned the meeting which the UN Security Council will be 
holding in New York this afternoon to produce a resolution or 
declaration.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, Feb 25 (AFP) -- The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation is to send a high-level mission to Moscow 
next week in a bid to sign Russia up to military cooperation 
with the alliance, NATO diplomats said here Friday [25 February]. 
  The trip coincides with growing worry in Western capitals 
that resurgent Russian nationalism is pushing Moscow into a more 
confrontational attitude towards the West. 
  The mission comprises the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert 
Hunter, and his counterparts from Britain, Sir John Weston, and 
Spain, Carlos Miranda. 
  A U.S. spokesman at NATO said the trip "explains and seeks 
to 
encourage membership" by Russia in a Partnership for Peace 
initiative between the trans-Atlantic alliance and countries of 
the former Soviet bloc. 
  The initiative involves East-West cooperation in a wide 
range 
of military and political activities ranging from joint military 
manoeuvres to peace-keeping. 
  A NATO source, speaking on condition that he not be named, 
said the alliance was anxious to get Russia to join. "We want 
to get the message across clearly that NATO is not trying to 
isolate Russia." 
  He added: "We are at a very delicate stage of our relations 
with Russia. We want a harmonious relationship of cooperation 
with it.... It is clear we must work doubly hard in 
establishing (military) relations with Russia." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Frankfurt, Feb. 26 KYODO -- Japan's towering trade 
surplus drew strong criticism from other leading industrial 
countries Saturday [26 February] at a meeting in Germany of 
their top fiscal and monetary officials, Japanese sources said. 
  Japan was asked to make stepped-up efforts to stimulate its 
domestic demand in order to make a dent in its 100 billion 
dollar current-account surplus, the sources said. 
  Finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven 
(G-7) economic powers convened in the Frankfurt suburb of 
Kronberg to discuss aid to Russia and world economic growth. 
  During the meeting, Japan sought to obtain support from its 
G-7 partners for cooperation to put a cap on the yen's uptrend, 
which quickened its pace after Japan-U.S. trade talks got bogged 
down two weeks ago, they said. 
  Japan's Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and Bank of Japan 
Governor Yasushi Mieno tried to extract commitments from their 
G-7 counterparts to the agreement last April against any 
excessive volatility on the foreign exchange market. 
  They emphasized Tokyo's efforts to enliven the groggy 
domestic economy and thereby curtail its mammoth trade surplus, 
while arguing a sharp upswing of the yen would offset the 
effects of such efforts, the sources said. 
  Fujii detailed the government's steps to shore up the 
economy, including a 15.25-trillion yen stimulus package 
unveiled earlier this month, they said. 
  After discussions on macroeconomic issues, the G-7 finance 
ministers and central bankers invited Russian delegates, 
including Acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Economics 
Minister Aleksandr Shokin, to join them for talks over the 
West's financial assistance to Russia. 
  The Russian delegates briefed the G-7 officials on the 
Russian economic policy under the new cabinet. 
  The meeting came amid heightening tension over the 
trans-Pacific trade dispute on how to ensure a substantial 
reduction in Japan's towering trade surplus with the U.S. 
  With Washington moving toward a tougher posture in the trade 
row by President Bill Clinton threatening sanctions, Japan has 
pledged to draft a trade package by the end of March to speed up 
deregulations and boost imports. 
  Prior to the G-7 meeting, however, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen expressed strong dissatisfaction about Japan's 
achievements so far in slashing the surplus.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- Talks to bring Sweden and 
Finland into the European Union (EU) made progress Sunday [27 
February] but negotiations with Austria and Norway were still 
stalled, European Commission officials said Sunday. 
  European Affairs ministers of the 12 EU [European Union] 
member countries and representatives of the four candidates have 
been engaged in talks on the countries' applications since 
Friday. 
  The negotiators are facing a March 1 deadline to conclude 
the 
talks so that the European Parliament can approve the result and 
the applicants can hold referendums in time to enter the EU 
formally next January 1. 
  "We are making very good progress with Sweden, the situation 
is good with Finland, but its a little more complicated with 
Norway and Austria," a Commission source said. 
  French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure late 
Saturday warned that brinkmanship would not help the applicants 
wrest concessions ahead of Monday night's deadline. 
  Representatives from the four candidate countries had 
separate meetings with the EU negotiators early Sunday, with EU 
ministers meeting later for lunch to discuss the state of the 
talks. 
  Sources close to the negotiations said that Norway was still 
refusing to allow EU countries greater access to its fish-rich 
waters, or to accept limitations on its fish exports to the 
Union if it became a member. 
  Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen said Saturday 
that Norway could not give up "responsible management" of its 
fish resources by allowing EU fishing fleets increased access to 
its waters as the price of EU membership. Norway has ruled out 
demands by Spain, Portugal and Ireland for new catch quotas in 
Norwegian waters. 
  Austria also had refused to cut short a 12-year accord to 
limit polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, which 
the EU maintains would contravene its basic principal of free 
movement. Viennese officials, facing a vocal environmentalist 
lobby in regional elections next month, refused an EU compromise 
offer to let the trans-Alpine transport agreement run to 
end-1999. 
  Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said it was 
"inconceivable" that the accord could be cut short before its 
scheduled end date of end-2004. 
  Finland was less hardline in its opposition to the 
membership 
terms offered by the EU, but expressed concern that farmers in 
the southern part of the country would not qualify for special 
subsidies. 
  EU officials were confident meanwhile that Sweden would sign 
up to EU rules although Brussels has rejected Sweden's plea for 
more time to pay its high membership dues. The talks with 
Sweden centred Sunday on technical matters including the 
country's strict anti-salmonella regulations and EU regulations 
over banana imports, EU sources said. 
  The EU was unable meanwhile to overcome an internal squabble 
over the balance of power between its richer and poorer 
countries. 
  Spain was pushing, against the combined weight of its EU 
partners and the four applicants, for rules to ensure that 
enlargement would not reinforce the influence of the richer 
northern countries at the expense of the poorer south.

  [Excerpt] Now to Brussels and the Swedish EU negotiations. 
Less than an hour ago the decisive final negotiations were 
started, and heavy going is expected in the case of the budget, 
where the EU has said no to lowered fees and, instead, is 
offering Sweden an extra sum of money. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] It takes two to tango, Swedish 
Minister for Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said in Brussels today at 
his international news conference. [passage indistinct] 
  Sweden is negotiating with 12 countries who are having their 
own internal games, but today the EU countries were finally 
united on their offers. It is still a clear no to Sweden which 
hoped for a lowered membership fee during the first few years. 
Instead, Sweden is being offered a sum of money which is about 
four million Swedish crowns, less than one-third the rebate 
Sweden was hoping to get. Despite this, Sweden is still the 
country with the best negotiation situation. Is Sweden going to 
sign the deal without the other countries seeking membership, if 
the other candidates stay behind, Minister for Europe Ulf 
Dinkelspiel? 
  [Dinkelspiel] If we reach a satisfactory agreement and both 
parties feel that it is time to sign the agreement, then we will 
sign the agreement. But, our ambition and the ambition of the 
EU is that all candidate countries will be able to conclude at 
practically the same time, and we are going to work towards this 
end. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] Talks on the terms of Finland's possible 
membership of the European Union [EU] have moved into a crucial 
phase with negotiators in Brussels working to reach settlement 
by midnight Monday [28 February]. According to our 
correspondents in Brussels, positions on the key issue of 
regional supports were still far apart on Sunday. We have this 
report. 
  [Unidentified reporter] It looked on Sunday as if a war of 
nerves was underway in EU membership negotiations in Brussels. 
Finnish representatives and officials of the EU gave the media 
directly conflicting statements on the measure of progress seen. 
The chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, Theodhoros 
Pangalos, told the press on Sunday afternoon that talks with 
Sweden were the furthest advanced, closely followed by 
discussions with Finland. He stated that he believed that a 
settlement was forthcoming on the tough question of the future 
of Finland's agricultural sector within the EU. 
  In contrast, both Finland's Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto 
and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen said that not much 
ground had been covered on Sunday. Salolainen stated that all 
of the crucial issues were still unresolved and that the EU was 
holding to its previous positions -- stands which Finland has 
declared as unacceptable. Salolainen added that while 
everything possible is being done to ensure the achievement of 
accord on membership terms, Finland is insisting on viable terms. 
  [Announcer] Meanwhile, the Finnish center-right coalition 
cabinet was scheduled to meet late Sunday evening to debate the 
latest results in the membership talks in Brussels. President 
Mauno Koivisto was also expected to sit in on the cabinet 
meeting.

  [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
is leaning towards making final take-it-or-leave-it offers to 
Norway and Austria in last-minute negotiations on enlarging the 
Union, Spain said here Sunday [27 February]. 
  Spanish Secretary of State for European Affairs Carlos 
Westendorp said most EU countries were impatient with the 
hardline stance of the two countries, which are negotiating to 
join the Union with Sweden and Finland. 
  "Many (EU) members think the moment has arrived to find out 
who is ready to join the EU and who is not. The impression is 
there are some candidates which are not interested in closing 
the negotiations," he told journalists. 
  Westendorp was speaking during intense talks to wrap up 
year-long talks with the four countries by a deadline of Monday 
midnight. But diplomats said Denmark and Germany were resisting 
attempts to hive Norway and Austria out of the negotiations 
unless the two applicants softened their entry demands. 
  The talks were continuing late into Sunday night. Diplomats 
said Sweden was closest to agreeing on entry terms to join the 
Union, followed by Finland which was still insisting on more aid 
for its farmers. But the EU was still far from overcoming 
Norway's flat refusal either to allow more access to its 
fish-rich waters, or to accept limits on its fish exports to 
other countries of the Union. 
  Norway's Minister of the Sea, Greta Knudsen, repeated her 
country's battle-cry in the negotiations late Sunday: "Not a 
single extra fish" (for EU and particularly Spanish vessels in 
Norwegian waters). 
  Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said there was no 
agreement in sight on the other major obstacle -- Austria's 
insistence on maintaining strict controls on polluting truck 
traffic across the Austrian Alps until end-2004. 
  Austria has hardened its refusal to compromise on 
trans-Alpine truck pollution since the Swiss public voted a week 
ago to take foreign trucks off Swiss roads within 10 years and 
make them cross the Alps by rail. 
  The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, 
Theodoros Pangalos, warned that the enlargement talks could also 
collapse over a dispute over how enlargement of the Union would 
affect the balance of power within it. 
  Britain is trying to modify the EU's system of majority 
voting so that the entry of new members will not increase the 
number of votes needed for blocking minorities in ministerial 
councils. 
  Spain wants the system changed so that the newcomers, all 
from northern Europe and all relatively wealthy, do not dilute 
the influence of the poorer southern members, particularly in 
decisions on monetary union. 
  Pangalos warned that the European Parliament might also 
block 
any enlargement agreement because of balance-of-power concerns. 
He called for an urgent study so that the Parliament could be 
enlightened on the issue before its vote on enlargement, which 
must be held by May. 
  The negotiations are supposed to be wrapped up by Monday 
midnight so that the successful applicants can join the EU on 
target on January 1 next year.

  [Text] On officially the last day of Austria's negotiations 
for European Union [EU] membership the tough positions of the 
two sides remain unchanged. The major obstacles to a conclusion 
on schedule continue to be the issues of transit and agriculture. 
  Yesterday evening in Brussels, Foreign Minister Mock no 
longer ruled out the possibility that the talks might be broken 
off. He said literally that a crisis where one might go home 
has certainly arisen. Greek EU Chairman Pangalos said that he 
would deplore such a step very much. He did not want to rule 
out a successful conclusion of the negotiations despite the 
current crisis.

  [Text] Deliberations within the European Union [EU] on the 
countermeasures taken by Greece against Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] are in progress. German 
Deputy Foreign Minister (Helmut Scheffer) will go to Skopje on 
Monday [28 February] as mediator. British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd is expected in Athens tomorrow. Furthermore, the 
issue of Skopje is expected to be discussed in Brussels at the 
EU Council of General Affairs. At the same time, EU 
Commissioner for Foreign Affairs Hans van den Broek had a 
telephone conversation with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias and told him that [FYROM President] Kiro Gligorov's 
regime considers the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed 
by Greece as a necessary precondition for the beginning of the 
process of solving the dispute with Athens. 
  In the meantime, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's 
answering letter to EU Commission President Jacques Delors and 
the note with Greece's legal arguments to the European 
Commission on the issue were presented yesterday in Brussels. 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos stressed that the 
Greek prime minister's answer to Delors is purely political in 
character. Regarding the legal issues raised by Delors, the 
prime minister called attention to the note sent to Brussels by 
the Greek Government. Venizelos stressed that Greece is the 
first to wish for the lifting of the measures as quickly as 
possible, but for this to happen Skopje must give the three 
practical signs of goodwill that have been set demanded by the 
Greek side. 
  Prime Minister Papandreou will brief President Konstandinos 
Karamanlis in the next few days regarding developments on the 
Skopje issue.

<F P=106> [Kustaa Hulkko report: "Top Names To Participate in EU Data </F>
Network Group"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] is beginning negotiations on 
a free trade agreement with the Baltic states. At their meeting 
in Brussels, the EU foreign ministers selected a number of top 
names in European electronics to join a working group assigned 
to develop a European data network strategy. The 19-member 
working group, headed by EU Inustrial Affairs Commissioner 
Martin Bangemann, will be reinforced with five top executives in 
European key positions: Jan Timmer from Philips, Heinrich von 
Pierer from Siemens, Carlo de Benedetti from Olivetti, Pierre 
Suard from Alcatel, and Peter Bonfield from ICL. 
  The working group has been commissioned to prepare the 
implementation of the EU white paper recommendations for 
economic growth in the area of computer-based data networks. 
  The group includes representatives from all EU countries. 
Other members are former Volvo CEO Pehr Gyllenhammar and IBM 
Europe's Managing Director Hans-Olaf Henkel. 
<H5>  Agreements in Baltic Countries </H5>
  The EU Foreign Ministers have decided to authorize the 
Commission to negotiate free trade agreements with Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania. 
  According to sources at the Commission, the final agreements 
may vary with respect to differences in the economic development 
phases between these countries with, for instance, Estonia 
maintaining no customs protection. 
  The EU aims to follow up the free trade agreement with 
association agreements, seen as preliminary stages of membership 
for these East European countries. It is intended to include a 
declaration to this effect in the preamble to the free trade 
agreements. 
  The Commission's authorization for negotiations with the 
Baltic states was still being hampered only last year by 
Germany's wish to start discussions concerning a broader 
European agreement with these states. Such an agreement would, 
however, have required ratification by member states and would 
probably also have postponed the implementation of the free 
trade agreement to next year. 
  To solve this problem, it has now been decided that there 
will be an interim free trade agreement as an initial step to an 
additional association agreement. 
  The foreign ministers announced that the EU would like to 
establish closer relations with Ukraine. They were concerned, 
however, about the fact that this country has not yet signed the 
nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Commission has been 
authorized to negotiate a partnership and cooperation agreement 
with Ukraine. 
  Negotiations on a similar agreement between the EU and 
Russia 
have already been going on for a long time. The lack of results 
is due, among other things, to the EU's refusal to accept 
essential reductions in the rights of foreign banks in Russia. 
<H5>  Universal Mail </H5>
  The foreign ministers confirmed formally earlier resolutions 
made by the Council of Ministers in December concerning 
so-called universal postal and telecommunications services. The 
EU aims to ensure basic postal services in the context of postal 
markets being opened to competition. 
  In the next stage, the Commission will define the concept of 
"universal services" and other regulations for postal services. 
  In the area of telecommunications services, the EU aims to 
ensure consumers a guaranteed minimum level of service at a 
reasonable price. This means in practice that the telephone 
companies would obviously be able to subsidize domestic calls 
using revenue from the more profitable long-distance 
communications.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alalin Prate, vice president of the European </F>
Investment Bank, by Baudouin Bollaert; place and date not given: 
"Prate: `The EIB Does Not Lack Resources, But Good Projects'" 
-- first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Text] Loans by the European Investment Bank (EIB), the 
European Union's [EU] financial institution, increased last year 
at a good rate, from ECU17 billion in 1992 to ECU19.6 billion in 
1993. Of this total, ECU17.7 billion went to the EU member 
states -- France ranked third among the beneficiaries, with 12.4 
percent of the loans granted -- while ECU1.9 billion went to 
third countries in the framework of the cooperation policy. 
EIB's French vice-president, Alain Prate, agreed to be 
interviewed by LE FIG-ECO. 
  [Bollaert] How far have we got with the European growth 
initiative and the white paper's promises in the areas of 
growth, competition, and employment? 
  [Prate] In the depths of a crisis and at a time of serious 
unemployment it really was the time to establish major 
intra-European infrastructures, open to both East and southern 
Europe. The first stage consisted of accelerating the financing 
by the EIB of major projects that already had been defined and 
were almost complete. Of the ECU5-billion budget agreed on at 
the Edinburgh summit, to which we should add the ECU2 billion 
from the Copenhagen summit, ECU5.1 billion has already been 
poured into 100 or so specific projects. I could mention the 
Paris-Brussels high-speed train link from the Belgian border to 
Brussels, the Chamoise tunnel, or various environmental 
protection projects, for example at Nancy, Nantes, or Belfort. 
We really are ahead of schedule! 
  [Bollaert] We could also mention the ECU1 billion, which 
includes various government low-interest loans, set aside to 
finance investments by small- and medium-sized companies.... 
  [Prate] Of course, this project is currently being 
implemented. However, we need to go further and enter a second 
stage with the emergence of new projects. This is why the 
Brussels summit decided to create, along the lines of the white 
paper, a group composed of the personal representatives of the 
heads of state and government of the Twelve -- the 
Christophersen Group -- with the mission of identifying new 
trans-European projects that should take priority. We are 
actively cooperating in the work of this group, and 26 projects 
are currently being examined. However, it is a difficult task 
and the problems sometimes go beyond merely finding the money.... 
  [Bollaert] For example? 
  [Prate] Take the high-speed rail link between Paris and 
Strasbourg: It should become the Paris-Frankfurt link. The 
French part is almost certain to be completed, but not the 
German part. The low profitability of the project implies a high 
rate of subsidy and, as a result, major public aid. This had 
led to a degree of reticence on the part of the Germans. That 
is why we have great expectations of the Christophersen Group. 
Through its advice and with the urging of the heads of state 
and government, we think that a certain number of projects that 
cannot be normally financed could benefit from the major support 
of the political authorities. 
  [Bollaert] But it will be difficult.... 
  [Prate] Yes. Take two other major projects, like the 
Brussels-Amsterdam-Cologne high-speed rail link, or the 
high-speed Eurotunnel train to London. In both cases, the high 
population density creates major environmental problems. In 
addition, the British Government would like a share of the money 
to come from the private sector. 
<H5>  Fundamental Criteria </H5>
  [Bollaert] Maybe we now understand better what [Prime 
Minister] Balladur meant when he said on the "Hour of Thruth" TV 
show that nothing much seemed to have come out of the Brussels 
summit.... 
  [Prate] The Christophersen Group has only met twice. We must 
give it time to work. 
  [Bollaert] In December, the Twelve were talking about 
ECU120 over six years to accelerate the creation of the major 
networks (transport, energy, and telecommunications) and about 
giving the EU "information highways." That is a fine program, 
but is it not too ambitious? 
  [Prate] For credits at normal rates, the EIB is quite 
capable 
of increasing its aid since our current ceiling is ECU144 
billion, of which only ECU98 billion have been used. We 
therefore have a large financial margin, all the more so since 
the ratification procedures for the European Investment Fund 
(EIF), the instrument guaranteeing the financing of major 
infrastructures and assisting small- and medium-sized companies, 
are almost completed. The EIF will therefore be an additional 
and useful way of easing the financing of major projects. 
  However, these projects -- which vary in their profitability 
-- still have to meet certain criteria which we consider to be 
fundamental: They must be well prepared technically; they must 
respect the environment; they must be economically viable; and 
they must be financially balanced. I repeat: We do not lack 
the resources. We do, however, need more good projects. 
  [Bollaert] The Commission in Brussels would nevertheless 
still like to issue "Union Bonds" -- bonds issued in the name of 
the EU -- to accelerate the movement.... 
  [Prate] It takes more than "Union Bonds" to create new 
projects. We all know that most finance ministers consider that 
the EU should not get too heavily into debt. There is still a 
difference between the approach of those who want to go ahead 
with new projects first and talk about the finances later, and 
those who want to do things the other way round. 
  [Bollaert] What about cooperation with East Europe and the 
countries of the Mediterranean basin? 
  [Prate] This made good progress in 1993, when we doubled the 
amount of financing. I could mention, among other things, the 
construction of the Algerian section of the Maghreb-Spain gas 
pipeline; the modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin rail link; and 
the action of the METAP (Technical Aid for the Environment in 
the Mediterranean), in which the World Bank, the European 
Commission, and the EIB have pooled their resources, in 
particular in the area of water management.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Luis </F>
Glueck; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Glueck] Mr. Vranitzky, how do you assess the 
state of talks with the European Union? 
  [Vranitzky] I assess the state of talks with the European 
Union in a realistic manner -- that substantive progress has 
been achieved in some areas whereas positions still clash 
severely in other spheres. However, I am confident that it will 
be possible to narrow the differences. 
  [Glueck] Are you optimistic? 
  [Vranitzky] I am realistic. I have attended numerous 
negotiations of this kind. The current developments are nothing 
new. We not only want to conclude talks, but we want to 
conclude them by safeguarding Austria's interests. Other 
countries have different goals and different interests that do 
not -- or do not yet -- correspond to ours. Thus, talks must 
continue. 
  [Glueck] Will Austria continue the poker game until Monday 
evening [28 February]? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, I think so. This is to be expected. I do 
not really think that one should compare negotiations with a 
poker game. But if you use this comparison, I believe that we 
should not be nervous. We will try to avoid becoming nervous. 
  [Glueck] Mr. Chancellor, the Austrian People's Party 
suggested recently that the referendum be postponed until the 
fall. 
  [Vranitzky] It is much too early to make a final statement. 
I believe that we should concentrate our efforts on the current 
negotiations and results. Once talks are concluded, there will 
still be time to think of other dates.

<F P=106> [Interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F>
Norbert Mayer; place and date not given: "Germany Urges Quick 
Conclusion"] 
  [Text] [Mayer] Mr. Kinkel, it will become clear during 
the weekend whether the countries willing to join the European 
Union will be able to conclude negotiations according to 
schedule. Will you support Austria's concerns? 
  [Kinkel] The German Government strongly supports the desire 
of Austria and the other states of the European Free Trade 
Association to join the European Union. The German delegation 
was advised to examine Austria's concerns with the necessary 
flexibility and understanding. 
  [Mayer] Which of the three problems -- transit, agriculture, 
acquisition of land -- do you consider the most sensitive issue? 
  [Kinkel] All the spheres you mentioned are difficult but not 
insoluble. It is important to find solutions that are 
acceptable to all sides and that are within the framework of 
what has been achieved in the European Union so far. On the 
secondary homes issue that you mentioned, only a solution that 
grants the same rights to citizens from Munich or Vienna is 
acceptable to us -- to use a graphic example. 
  [Mayer] If talks are not concluded by the beginning of March 
1994, membership will be postponed. Germany will hold the 
chairmanship of the European Union for six months as of 1 July. 
Are quick negotiations after this date conceivable? What will 
Bonn's contribution to successful negotiations be? 
  [Kinkel] The German government will emphatically support a 
successful conclusion of the negotiations according to schedule 
on 1 March 1994. I will do everything possible to ensure that. 
I hope that accession talks will no longer be on the agenda 
during the German presidency in the second half of 1994. At 
that time the ratification process should be well under way in 
the member states and in the countries that want to join the 
European Union. Otherwise membership cannot take effect on 1 
January 1995. 
  [Mayer] To what extent do the candidates influence the 
topical problems of the European Union? 
  [Kinkel] The applicants will be important and welcome 
members of the European Union. All four states have long 
democratic traditions and highly-developed national economies. 
These states naturally have similar problems to the other 
members of the European Union. However, they have realized that 
there are no panaceas and no special cures. I see no 
insuperable difficulties in the institutional sphere if the new 
members demonstrate the political will to support the 
Community's policy and observe the rules stipulated in the 
agreements. During the accession talks, we agreed to adapt the 
institutions to a larger number of members. At the government 
conference scheduled for 1996 we will have to take stock and 
examine proposals for changes on this basis.

Czoeppan in Vienna on 25 February -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Czoeppan] Now there is some -- slight -- hope 
that the completion of the Czech nuclear power station in 
Temelin might be prevented. Today the Austrian Temelin 
delegation returned from Washington. The Greens want to 
continue intervention in Washington, while the federal 
chancellor is against the so-called permanent lobbying by the 
Austrian side. There is, however, agreement that the Austrian 
efforts in Washington have had a positive effect. 
  [Vranitzky] They have objectively become better, even though 
one cannot yet say anything for sure at the moment. 
  [Czoeppan] What will happen next? Will Austria pursue a 
kind of permanent lobbying strategy on Temelin? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, it will probably not be permanent 
lobbying, but we will certainly take advantage of the chances 
that we still have, which is why Professor Heindler stayed 
there. As new information comes in, I will decide whether or 
not we will engage in other activities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Guido Boodts Commentary: "Strong Language"] </F>
  [Text] Showing no signs of being affected by the political 
slap in the face he received from the Russian parliament on 
Wednesday [23 February], President Yeltsin has given his first 
state of the nation speech. Yeltsin made no more than a passing 
reference to the amnesty granted by the people's representatives 
to his adversaries who he had ejected by force from the 
parliament building last October. 
  But he was clearly aware of which way the political wind has 
been blowing since the elections and referendum on the 
Constitution, which he called in December. Yeltsin used some 
very strong language in connection with the West and seemed 
determined to build on the success he scored in Sarajevo. 
  Yeltsin believes that the world is going to have to take 
account of a strong and self-confident Russia. The sometimes 
large numbers of Russians living in the former Soviet republics 
-- where they have often become a minority group suffering 
discrimination at the hands of the ruling elite -- are to be the 
principal initial point of focus for his policy. 
  The right to intervene, which Yeltsin is loudly claiming is 
reminiscent of Leonid Brezhnev's declared right to intervene in 
Central and East Europe in order to safeguard orthodox Communist 
regimes. Yeltsin is even trying to present his ideas as 
humanitarian intervention in aid of the oppressed and victims of 
human rights violations. 
  The danger of Yeltsin's stance is that he apparently 
considers that he can unilaterally decide on the need for such 
intervention and that other countries must simply accept it. 
  This reasoning will no doubt cause concern in a number of 
the 
republics concerned. There are still some 20,000 Russian troops 
in the Baltic states. In Ukraine too, there is unease at the 
prospect of Russian interference. By contrast, other republics 
-- such as Georgia and Tajikistan -- are seeking closer ties 
with Russia. 
  In the West, Yeltsin's statements will lead to an increasing 
awareness that the time of a submissive Russia is now past, 
especially in the area of defense. Yeltsin also issued the 
threat that the expansion of NATO without Russia's agreement 
would constitute a threat to world peace. In this respect, 
Yeltsin is probably not calling for an express right to 
intervene, but rather something which amounts to the right to 
veto any proposed NATO enlargement. 
  If Yeltsin's words are understood to be more than an attempt 
to take the wind out of the sails of the ultranationalist 
Zhirinovsky, then they represent a degree of danger. 
  In the economic sphere too, Yeltsin seems to want to set a 
more resolute course which is less in line with the West. His 
priority is to be the fight against inflation. He confirmed 
that he would continue with economic reforms. But in the same 
breath, he also stated that the state must play a more active 
role in the economy, and that industry must support the reforms 
and ensure that they are made more bearable for the people. But 
how can he prevent the government from allocating the massive 
aid it has promised to state-owned industries and the central 
bank from financing the deficit by printing more money? 
  This first state of the nation address by Yeltsin is not 
good 
news for the West. Ordinary Russians have long since lost all 
faith in the words of politicians. And it is far from certain 
that his strong words are strong enough to make the opposition 
more cooperative.

<F P=106> [Marie-France commentary: "Rwanda: A Different War"] </F>
  [Text] The dirty tricks which for several months have been 
aiming at giving the opposition or the presidential circles the 
control over the government and the provisional assembly in 
Rwanda are actually one thing: The carrying out of the war with 
other means. International pressures were essential in reaching 
a peace agreement in 1993. Are they clear enough today? 
Several Rwandan sources said that Belgian Foreign Minister 
Claes did not mince words [during his visit] in Kigali. The UN 
envoy did so too. However, in the name of nonintervention -- 
probably --, those diplomats do not clearly point at the most 
serious responsibilities involved in the crisis. 
  It must be said that the manipulations of the lists of 
deputies and ministers from two parties (the four other are 
ready) which block the establishment of the institutions are not 
justified: Within the Liberal Party, the splitting only took 
place after the prefectorial congress meetings elected their 
deputies. The votes were checked by a notary public and the 
elected officials cannot be contested. Within the Republican 
Democratic Movement, the polls can only be contested for two 
deputies from two prefectures where double party congress 
meetings were held; the nine regular officials should be 
elected. For the two others, as for the ministers, a political 
compromise will probably be necessary -- but no one can afford 
to wait until then to establish the institutions. 
  The Patriotic Front maintained self-control and did not 
resume warfare after the murderous attacks of Tuesday [22 
February]. The Rwandan population showed maturity and did not 
engage in the inter-ethnic killings that some people might 
expect: There were assasinations in Kigali but no general 
movement of violence from the population. The MRND [National 
Republican Movement for Democracy and Development], the 
presidential party, rightly stresses the responsibility of the 
(opposition) prime minister who no longer convenes any meeting 
of his ministers, thus making chaos even worse. 
  The international community will have to clearly lend its 
support to those Rwandan leaders who bring their fair share to 
the peace agreement and bring them to the foreground. 
Otherwise, today's insidious war will become tomorrow's blaze.

  [Excerpt] The Hague -- Because the Inkatha movement resorts 
to violence in South Africa and does not participate in next 
April's elections, the movement is, for the time being, not 
eligible for financial support from the Netherlands. As soon as 
the movement renounces violence, participates in the elections, 
and accepts the basic principles of democracy, the movement will 
be entitled to support. 
  This was stated by Development Cooperation Minister Pronk 
this morning, during a discussion with the House of 
Representatives. In principle, 100,000 guilders in financial 
support has been appropriated for the ANC [African National 
Congress], the National Party, the Freedom Alliance, and the 
Inkatha movement. The outcome of the elections will then 
determine how much money a specific party will get on top of 
that. 
  The Council for the New South Africa, in which PvdA [Labor 
Party], CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal], VVD [People's Party 
for Freedom and Democracy], D66 [Democrats 66], GroenLinks 
[Green Left], SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed 
Political Union], RPF [Reformational Political Federation] are 
represented, determines whether or not a request from a South 
African political party is complied with. For the next two 
years, 10 million guilders is available. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [NRC HANDELSBLAD report on interview with Bolkestein, leader </F>
of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, VVD, in The 
Hague on 23 February: "What a Mess, What a Muddle"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague, 23 Feb -- The CPB [Central Planning 
Bureau] has calculated the costs of the election programs. 
Armed with these calculations, the party leaders are hurling 
abuse at one another. But what is it all about? Employment, 
wages, or the environment? Which is the most social party? And 
who is leading the field? VVD [People's Party for Freedom and 
Democracy] leader Bolkestein: "The voter is nobody's fool." 
[passage omitted] 
  The VVD leader aims his attacks at the report which Lubbers 
and Kok submitted to the Parliament yesterday. This contains 
details of the government's decision to reduce the tax burden by 
five billion guilders. "What a mess. It brings chaos to public 
funds," states Bolkestein. "The report states that the 
country's financial debt will amount to 3.75 percent of the 
national income in 1996." The VVD leader throws up his hands: 
"3.75 percent, that is the percentage which the government had 
promised for 1993. This year it was supposed to fall to 3.25 
percent. What a muddle." The opposition leader could challenge 
Lubbers and Kok to a debate in Parliament, but he is not going 
to. "First things first. First the local elections." 
  "The debt must be further reduced," argues Bolkestein. "This 
government is not doing anything any more. The future offers 
little hope. The CDA [Christian Democrat Appeal] is letting the 
debt increase over the next three years. Mind you, they are 
behind the other parties in the polls, including the Green Left. 
The CDA reasons that they will make up for it at the end. Any 
politician knows that it doesn't work like that. You can see 
this now. This government has reduced the debt, but has allowed 
the tax burden to increase by an amount which is greater than 
the fall in the public debt. I could do that too. There's 
nothing clever about that." 
  An expected tax gift of 3.3 billion guilders in 1994, rising 
to 4.5 billion in 1995, is described by Bolkestein as "hot air." 
Seeing is believing, is the VVD leader's reaction. You must be 
careful, and first do your homework, says Bolkestein. "Why is 
Kok getting involved in this, perhaps he is going to be mayor of 
Amsterdam during the next government." 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] At an election meeting in Westzaan the CDA 
leader Brinkman seemed pleased. The CPB had calculated that 
pensioners lose more under the VVD than the CDA. While the VVD 
links pensions to wages and the CDA doesn't. 
  [Bolkestein] I don't know of any purchasing power outlines 
drawn up by the CPB which have ever proved to be correct. We 
have made the decision in principle that pensions would follow 
trends in prosperity. This means that the purchasing power of 
pensioners may fall. But if wages suddenly increase, pensioners 
benefit with us. But not with the CDA. What are we talking 
about here? The CPB calculates the difference in the purchasing 
power of pensioners between the VVD and CDA as one quarter of 
one percent per year. We must stop this purchasing power talk. 
[passage omitted] 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] For new registrations, the VVD wants 
social 
security payments to be limited to 60 percent of the minimum 
wage. Unemployment benefit is also to drop to 60 percent of the 
minimum wage, while people cannot take out additional insurance 
against unemployment? 
  [Bolkestein] I do not know how the market is going to react. 
Insurance products will no doubt be created, and the Planning 
Bureau is also taking this into account. But I do not pretend 
that it is always going to be easy. But do we want a flexible 
labor market or not? If you do, then you must provide financial 
incentives. A more dynamic economy is not achieved all by 
itself. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] You have people who are on benefit 
payments 
bear all the burden. PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok is proposing 
that benefits should be linked to a limited degree by as early 
as next year. 
  [Bolkestein] The linkage idea is at odds with economic 
growth. Linkage destroys jobs. Everybody knows that. So when 
Kok says that "next year we can perhaps have some linkage" he is 
only doing himself harm. He also wants job growth. We must 
move toward a more flexible economy. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Is the VVD program socially acceptable? 
  [Bolkestein] And what do you mean by "socially acceptable?" 
It is all a matter of action versus inaction. We choose for a 
growth in employment, with 124,000 new jobs. Under the VVD 
program in 1998 there will be 80 people on benefit for every 100 
people with a job. With all the other parties this figure is 
higher. Our policy shows that it is perfectly easy to solve, 
but it is being made extremely complicated by many people in 
this country -- and especially Lubbers. 
  [NRC HANDELSBLAD] Politics aside, The Hague is no basis for 
your ideas in the social sphere. 
  [BOLKESTEIN] The basis is determined by one fact alone, and 
that is a parliamentary majority. How representative is the 
trade union movement, for example, when it represents just one 
quarter of workers? The government must govern, and then you 
have a basis. When Lubber forcefully states that we are facing a 
new reality from Asia, East Europe and the United States -- in 
short, more competition -- than the people will act. Then you 
have the choice between superficial change and a change to the 
system. We choose for a change to the system. The voter is 
nobody's fool; people can say what they like.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Philips Teaming Up With U.S. </F>
Company for Cable TV"] 
  [Excerpts] Eindhoven -- Together with U.S. company United 
International, Philips Media will form the biggest private cable 
TV operator in Europe. Both companies, which presently have 
minor common interests in cable networks throughout 11 
countries, are preparing what is already known in the United 
States as the "electronic highway," i.e. cable networks through 
which any possible information can be transmitted. 
  So far, Philips and United were competitors on the newly 
emerging market for cable TV in Europe. The joint venture they 
intend to establish by the end of the current year, will not 
only be the biggest, but also the only private operator. Unlike 
in the United States, most cable TV networks in Europe are still 
controlled by municipalities or by semi-public institutions such 
as the German Bundespost. [passage omitted] 
  According to spokesmen for United and Philips, the new 
company has a very strong growth potential. Right now, steps 
have already been taken in order to acquire an interest in cable 
networks worth another 5 million connections in 10 European 
countries. According to United's Chief Executive W. Eisner, 
both companies benefit from the European trend toward 
privatization of cable networks. 
  United International is only operational outside the United 
States. [passage omitted] 
  United International has business interests in the Far East, 
Czechia, Brazil, and Chili. 
  In Europe, most networks are still being used to transmit 
radio and television only. However, Philips is mostly 
interested in the future transmission of other information. The 
concern from Eindhoven is obviously thinking of applications 
such as video movies, music and other information products. 
  The European Union is also interested in the new 
technological possibilities offered by cable television 
networks. A working party with representatives from telephone 
companies, cable operators, and electronics manufacturers such 
as Philips, is going to examine on behalf of the European 
Community, whether the implementation of an electronic highway 
is feasible.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "PTT Telecom Acquires Stake in </F>
Indonesian Telephone Company"] 
  [Excerpt] PTT Telecom has acquired a 30-percent stake worth 
$90 million (approximately 175 million guilders -- NRC 
HANDELSBLAD editor's note) in the Indonesian Bakrie Electronic 
Company [BEC]. 
  This acquisition makes the Netherlands company the first 
foreign company to acquire a share in the Indonesian 
telecommunications market. PTT Telecom describes the stake in 
BEC as being of strategic interest. The Netherlands company is 
predicting further growth on the Indonesian market, from where 
it intends to expand into Southeast Asia. At the end of last 
year, PTT Telecom already concluded a cooperation agreement with 
the Indonesian state-owned telecommunications company Telkom. 
However, this did not result in any specific initiatives. At 
the time, B. Verwaayen, a director of PTT Telecom, said that the 
Netherlands company wanted to participate in the imminent rapid 
growth in Indonesia. Indonesia has a total of 187 million 
inhabitants, but has [an average of] less than two lines 
connected per 100 inhabitants. Telkom wants to increase the 
number of connected lines to at least 7 million within five 
years. 
  Bakrie Electric Company is a subsidiary of Bakrie and 
Brothers, a conglomerate active in the steel sector, 
plantations, chemicals, communications, and immovables. BEC has 
more than 121,000 telephone lines (5 percent of the total number 
of lines in Indonesia -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note). The 
revenue derived from their operation is shared with Telkom. At 
the same time, BEC is involved in establishing telephone 
networks in Jakarta and Bandung, markets which comprise at least 
250,000 and 30,000 lines respectively. These networks are being 
laid and operated by a separate company, Ratelindo, in which BEC 
owns a 55-percent stake and Telkom a 45-percent stake. 
  Of the 90 million dollars paid by PTT Telecom for its stake 
in BEC, Bakrie and Brothers is investing 72 percent in its 
subsidiary. The rest will go to other Bakrie companies, 
according to Tanri Abeng, the general manager of Bakrie 
Electronic. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Jean Chretien says Canada will take 
unilateral action if foreign vessels do not respect an 
international agreement to halt fishing on the Grand Bank off 
the east coast. Mr. Chretien says Canada may even extend its 
200-mile offshore economic zone to protect depleted stocks. 
  Canada has negotiated a one-year moratorium with more than a 
dozen other nations to protect threatened species in waters that 
straddle the Grand Bank or are just outside. Alvin Cater 
reports: 
  [Cater] At the legislature building in St John's, the prime 
minister listened to pleas for help from people whose lives have 
been ruined by the collapse of the Atlantic fishery. For two 
years a ban on the northern cod has deprived them of their 
livelihood. But foreign vessels have continued to fish just 
outside Canadian waters on the nose and the tail of the Grand 
Bank. In Brussels last week some European nations agreed to a 
moratorium on east coast fishing. Today Chretien warned Canada 
is preparing to flex its legislative muscle if the foreign 
fishing doesn't stop. 
  [Begin Chretien recording] The bill will be ready within 
weeks. As soon as the fishing starts again, if it's not 
respected, the bill will be passed and we will use the resources 
we have to make sure that the bill is respected. [end recording] 
  [Cater] Chretien wouldn't say how the government will police 
the nose and the tail of the Grand Bank if it extends Canada's 
jurisdiction. 
  Many people in the audience have been receiving federal aid 
since the ban was imposed but because of this week's budget 
they'll be receiving smaller checks. The prime minister only 
talked about the budget as he answered reporters' questions. He 
admitted the aid program is being scaled back but he insisted 
the cuts will not be drastic. 
  [Begin Chretien recording] There will be some change. I 
cannot deny that. But those who say that they will be cut in 
half, they will have to swallow their words. [end recording] 
  [Cater] The prime minister also said the government had no 
choice but to slash unemployment insurance [UI] benefit. 
Otherwise, he said, the UI fund would eventually go broke.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 26, IRNA -- A written message from Iran's 
President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was handed over to German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl here Friday [25 February]. The message 
was submitted by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi. 
  In his message, Rafsanjani welcomed the upgrading of ties 
between Iran and Germany and announced Tehran's readiness to 
promote bilateral regional and international cooperation. 
  Kohl too expressed pleasure towards expansion of bilateral 
ties and voiced satisfaction with the present ties. He also 
called for improvement and broadening of relations between Iran 
and the European Union (EU). 
  Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister for Euro-American affairs, 
said the existing favorable ties between Iran and Germany could 
prepare the way for consolidation and expansion of Tehran's 
relations with the EU. 
  He also announced Iran's readiness to actively cooperate 
with 
Germany in implementation of the second five-year development 
plan (to start March 21) and to cooperate with Germany and 
Europe in settlement of issues related to the Persian Gulf, 
Caspian Sea Littoral States Cooperation Organization, Economic 
Cooperation Organization (ECO) and internationl questions like 
the mass destructive weapons. 
  Va'ezi and Kohl also discussed settlement of financial 
issues 
with the former reiterating Tehran's expectation from Bonn to 
show more flexibility so as the remaining minor issues be solved 
as well. 
  Kohl announced Bonn's readiness to employ all its potentials 
to finalize all financial problems quickly. 
  Political circles here view Va'ezi's meeting with Kohl as an 
indication of the prominence Chancellor Kohl attaches to good 
relations with Iran. 
  Va'ezi arrived here last Monday at the invitation of his 
German counterpart Dieter Kastrup.

  [Text] Bonn, Feb. 24, IRNA -- Head of the German 
parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission Hans Stercken said 
Wednesday [23 February] that the world should appreciate Iran's 
efforts for the establishment of peace and tranquillity in the 
region. 
  In a meeting here with visiting Iranian Deputy Foreign 
Minister for Euro-American Affairs, Mahmud Va'ezi, Stercken 
noted that the German Government and parties shared the idea 
that friendly ties and cooperation with Iran should be continued. 
  The German official also called on Iran to play a more 
active 
role in solving Afghan issue and the regional crises and 
remarked that Iran had more power and authority to peacefully 
settle the crisis. 
  Va'ezi believed that the U.S. was the main obstacle on the 
way of materialization of a collective regional cooperation 
system as well as peace and security in the Persian Gulf. 
  He commented that the United States intended to drive the 
regional states closer to itself through sowing discord among 
Iran and his neighbors in order to sell them more weapons. 
  Pointing out that Iran had fully cooperated with the United 
Nations on Afghan issue, the Iranian diplomat noted that the 
international community, besides its humanitarian aids, should 
stop sending arms to the clashing groups in Afghanistan.

soon as a peace settlement for the country is negotiated at a

commissioned by the European Union is to rebuild the 
administration in the Croat-besieged Muslim stronghold of 
Mostar. German policemen and administrative officials could 
help the "emergency mayor." Under Bonn's plans, Bundeswehr 
medical officers are to operate the city's hospital and 
Bundeswehr engineers are to repair bridges and roads.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to Federal Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe, the probable cost of the German mission 
to Somalia is 310.3 million German marks [DM]. Of this amount, 
the return of the Bundeswehr unit cost about DM15 million, Ruehe 
said in Bonn this morning. Personnel, training, materiel, 
operations, and transport cost DM295.3 million. 
  A refund of DM70 million was expected from the United 
Nations, thus reducing the cost of the whole mission from May 
1993 to March 1994 to about DM240 million. The procurement 
costs for materiel of almost DM60 million also have to be 
deducted from this sum as "long-term investment." The Bundeswehr 
could use the additional improved equipment in future 
humanitarian missions, in case of disaster or as "crisis 
reaction forces." 
  Ruehe described the resources spent in Somalia as 
"investment 
in humanity and in the future of the Bundeswehr." The 
Bundeswehr's mission to Somalia saved tens of thousands of 
people from dying of starvation and from disease. The 
Bundeswehr also "gained unique experience." 
  The German support unit's camp at Beledwynne was cleared 
this 
morning. The commander, Colonel Holger Kammerhoff, was the last 
soldier to leave Beledwynne at 0936 local time. The whole 
German unit is to have returned to Germany by the end of March.

<F P=106> [Ulrich Rosenbaum report: "SPD Election Campaign Between </F>
Heaven and Earth"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] considers the withdrawal of Serb positions round Sarajevo 
under NATO pressure to be progress and a success following a 
deterrent strategy that ought to have been employed much 
earlier. Yet, the SPD continues to oppose the use of Bundeswehr 
troops in missions outside NATO territory. This was stated by 
Bundestag Group Chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose, talking to DIE WELT. 
Klose, who is responsible for the foreign policy part of the 
SPD government program, referred to the existing party 
conference resolutions that do not allow any participation in 
peacekeeping missions. "But I expect that the Federal 
Constitutional Court will decide on the SPD complaint in May or 
June. We will then take it from there," Klose said. 
  Klose, who is personally in favor of full German 
participation in peacekeeping missions, excludes a Bundeswehr 
mission in former Yugoslavia for "historic reasons." The 
presence of German troops would not only make the conflict in 
the Balkans more difficult to solve, but it would also create 
new potential for conflict. "There is complete agreement with 
the chancellor in this respect," Klose said. At the same time, 
he criticized Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who -- for tactical 
reasons in connection with the election campaign -- acts as if 
the Germans were being requested to assist right away. "We are 
withdrawing from Somalia, a German mission in former Yugoslavia 
is out of the question, and there are no further demands in 
sight. There is, therefore, no obligation to act," Klose said. 
  Rudolf Scharping's chief foreign policy expert positively 
judged the fact "that the Russians are back as an active 
superpower." Everyone is profiting from this: NATO and the 
United States because this has made an air strike on the 
surroundings of Sarajevo superfluous; the Russians because this 
success is a success for Yeltsin, which strengthens his domestic 
policy standing. "The Russians have proved to be part of the 
forces interested in stability," Klose said. At the same time 
he criticized the "fearmongering" among the nationalists 
surrounding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy; fear of the Russians has a 
long tradition in Germany and is currently being irresponsibly 
stirred up by the media. 
  For the debate on the SPD government program, the draft of 
which is to be presented in four weeks' time, Klose has worked 
out an eight-page foreign policy paper that is to be reduced to 
a page and a half in final editing. "This is not the foremost 
topic in this election year," the SPD group chairman said. In 
spite of all the common principles the SPD shares with the 
government, which Chairman Scharping emphasized in Munich 
recently, the paper will point out that in solving international 
conflicts, the SPD does not primarily think in military and 
diplomatic terms, but wants to tackle the reasons for the 
conflicts first. "As long as Europe is divided into poor and 
rich, there will always be conflicts," Klose said. 
  Against this background, the SPD has suggested extending the 
NATO Partnership for Peace offer to the former East Bloc 
countries to a "Partnership for Development" program. This 
suggestion has been welcomed by the Polish government. The SPD 
wants to keep NATO and the Western European Union as security 
instruments, but by linking various levels of dialogue, it wants 
to achieve "a completely new security infrastructure" in the 
long run. In this process, the Conference for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe could gain new significance.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bavarian Minister-President Edmund Stoiber </F>
by Gerhard Plott; place and date not given: "Bavarian Criticism 
of Brussels Centralism"] 
  [Excerpts] [Plott] You have sharply criticized Bonn's 
European policy and have described Chancellor Helmut Kohl as a 
"European illusionist." What would your European policy look 
like? 
  [Stoiber] Germany is basically pursuing a very good and 
responsible European policy. It has to be made clear to people 
that the European Union [EU] is a community for peace. Yet, in 
the almost 40 years of the history of the EU there have also 
been bureaucratic and misguided centralist developments, which 
is what I criticized. Unfortunately, those who criticize 
certain structures of the EU are deliberately misinterpreted -- 
as if one were an anti- European. Yet, no responsible 
politician can be anti-European. I am calling for more 
transparency, more subsidiarity.... 
  [Plott] ...as was laid down in Maastricht. 
  [Stoiber] Yes, but it also has to be put into practice. The 
problem is the deficit in democratic transparency of the Council 
of Ministers, the complacency of the Commission, which is 
absolutely detached from opinionmaking in the Parliament and 
control by the Parliament; the strict regulations that even 
determine whether or not people are permitted to swim in the 
Isar River -- everything is being decided in Brussels. There 
are many things that we do not need, things that increasingly 
annoy the people, who then, based on this annoyance, question 
Europe in general. That must be avoided. We must fight against 
this annoyance, try to change things, and take people along with 
Europe. Otherwise, we will drive them into the hands of the 
anti-Europeans. 
  [Plott] How do you explain that Heiner Geissler, who is 
deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, accused you 
of high treason? 
  [Stoiber] I no longer take Geissler politically seriously. 
  [Plott] It has been said again and again that you are trying 
to return to the nation state. 
  [Stoiber] That is wrong. I want to make clear that this 
Europe is absolutely unable to progress without nation states 
and without the nations' feeling of belonging together. A 
nation state would constitute a piece of centralism and would 
end national characteristic features, which would destroy Europe. 
  People are always insinuating that I want the nation state 
as 
such, based on the experience of the past. Yet I am thinking 
further than that. Those who underestimate the cohesive 
strength of the nation today and think that this strength could 
be replaced by Europe will be in for a nasty surprise. Thus, 
our Europe can only be one of nations and regions, a 
confederation of states. 
  [Plott] Could one say that the Germans are becoming 
unreliable fellows in European policy because they are seeking 
the right to resign from the confederation? 
  [Stoiber] No, I have never asked for that. All I did was to 
point out the difference between a federal state and a 
confederation. One cannot resign from a federal state, whereas 
from a confederation of states one can. Besides, the Federal 
Constitutional Court put it in exactly the same way. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Plott] Will Austria manage to enter the EU in time? 
  [Stoiber] I hope so, and I hope that the EU will show 
greater understanding for Austria's cause. We have greatly 
emphasized the need for Germany to support Austria's position in 
the negotiations. For us, Austria's accession is of vital 
importance. 
  The problems in the sphere of agriculture can be solved. The 
most difficult issue will certainly be the transit agreement. 
However, I think that a settlement can be found that is 
acceptable for all sides. 
  [Plott] Would you recommend that the Austrians vote "yes" in 
a referendum? 
  [Stoiber] Yes, by all means. Austria can progress for its 
own good only when its ties with the neighboring countries 
become closer and closer. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Winfried Muenster report: "Bavaria Wants To Force </F>
Reduction of German Contribution to European Union"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 24 Feb -- Bavaria wants to force the 
European Union (EU) to immediately reduce the financial burden 
on Germany. Thomas Goppel, current Bavarian European affairs 
minister and future environment minister, called on the Federal 
Government to block the decision on additional financial sources 
of the EU, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers in 
Brussels at the beginning of March, until, first, the current 
membership negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Norway, and 
Finland have been successfully concluded and, second, agreement 
on the "reduction of the German financial burden" has been 
reached. Responding to Goppel's demand, the FRG Finance 
Ministry said that one wants indeed to use all possibilities to 
reduce the German burden, but one does not want to call into 
question the political decision of the Edinburgh summit about 
the financing of the EU for the rest of the decade. 
  Germany's net burden at the EU, that is, the surplus of 
Bonn's financial contribution over the benefits from the EU, is 
clearly soaring. For 1990, the year of reunification, the 
Bundesbank registered 11.6 billion marks [DM]. The Finance 
Ministry puts the net balance of the current year at DM31.2 
billion. Goppel thinks that the pending "decision on 
independent means" of the Council of Ministers is the last 
opportunity in this decade to come to "a fairer burden-sharing 
in the EU." Obviously, it is impossible to achieve this goal 
via Brussels' payments to eastern Germany (DM28 billion until 
1999). The Council of Ministers' decision is to put the 
decision that the EU budget can be gradually expanded from 
currently about DM140 billion to more than DM200 billion by 1999 
into the form of a law. The German gross contribution would 
then rise from the current DM45.4 billion to approximately DM70 
billion. 
  Goppel's advance, which was coordinated with Bavarian 
Minister-President Edmund Stoiber but probably not with 
Christian Social Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, is 
undoubtedly part of the election campaign, during which the CSU 
critics want to deal with European integration. Nevertheless, 
Bavaria is also forced to act now, both because of the dates for 
decisionmaking in Brussels and because of the membership 
negotiations. "Many member states are vitally interested in 
raising the financial ceiling," Goppel said. This desire for 
raising the EU's financial means primarily applies to the 
southern members. During the current "hot" period of the 
membership negotiations they are causing difficulties, because 
they fear that the accession by the rich EFTA [European Free 
Trade Association] countries will lead to a majority of "net 
payers" in the Council of Ministers, which would oppose them. 
By practically taking the decision on the EU's financial means 
hostage, the Germans could force the south to agree to the 
expansion. 
  The Bonn Finance Ministry and the politicians in Munich 
partly agree on the question of how the burden on Germany could 
be eased. In both places it is insisted that the future net 
payments of the new members must not be used for additional 
expenditures by Brussels, as the south wants, but must be used 
to save money for the old members. While Goppel also suggests 
that Germany could either be exempt from participating in 
financing the British budget discount or could ask for a 
temporary discount itself because of the burdens it has to bear 
in eastern Germany, the politicians in Bonn state that, in the 
longer term they are striving for negotiations about London's 
discount. 
  In the EU it is criticized that the Germans are destroying 
the membership negotiations, which they want to save, by trying 
to hold parallel negotiations about easing the financial burden. 
Peter Schmidhuber, the EU commissioner for finances, who is 
also Bavarian, sees the solution to the EU's exploding budget in 
a real EU tax, which would be levied by the European Parliament. 
  Differing opinions of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
and the CSU on the goal of European policy once again became 
clear in Stoiber's criticism of the demand for a federal system 
in Europe, which is contained in the new CDU basic program. On 
Bavarian radio the CSU politician said that such a demand can 
never be implemented with his party. Sine there is an agreement 
between the two sister parties that the CDU can never outvote 
the CSU, the smaller partner, in federal issues, the CDU just 
has this demand written on paper. He does not believe that the 
CDU will put the cohesion of the CDU/CSU at stake because of 
this issue.

  [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The smuggling and illegal trade 
involving nuclear materials in Germany has risen sharply. 
  Quoting a confidential report by the German Interior 
Ministry, BILD AM SONNTAG reports that the number of attempts to 
make money from the illegal sale of nuclear materials rose to 
123 in 1993. In the previous year only 99 cases had been 
recorded. 
  Last year police made 545 arrests in connection with nuclear 
smuggling. The majority of the perpetrators came from Russia or 
the Czech Republic. In two cases, criminals attempted to 
extract millions [currency not given] by threatening to cause a 
nuclear explosion. However, the investigations showed that both 
cases were bluffs. The report says the total number of offenses 
involving radioactive materials in 1993 was 240.

<F P=106> [Interview with CDU Deputy Chairman Heinz Eggert by an </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "Election 
Campaign Not Just With One Man"] 
  [Text] [DIE WOCHE] The polls in the new laender have been 
disastrous for the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. What has 
been the CDU's biggest mistake in the east? 
  [Eggert] I am not sure that there has been any big mistake 
by the CDU. It is often forgotten that it has been four years 
since unification. Only a few critics imagine what would have 
happened if unification had not taken place. This does not rule 
out that in addition to the large amount of help -- one out of 
two marks that the east is using is produced in the west -- a 
lot of ignorance and arrogance has also been carried from the 
west to the east. In addition, the expectations of the people 
in the east were too high and cannot be fulfilled, especially 
not in times of recession. Now this is attributed to the party 
that is in the government. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Are the circumstances to be blamed? 
  [Eggert] If a party is no longer accepted, then 80 percent 
of the blame naturally goes to itself. There were several 
mishaps, personnel quarrels, and homemade affairs. In addition, 
we are now paying the bill for the fact that the CDU has been 
too clumsy to present the complicated problems, which have 
accumulated within the briefest possible period, as such and to 
show approaches to solutions. I believe that there has never 
been any election period during which so many problems needed 
solving at the same time. By the way, during the time of the 
upheaval, it was also not made clear enough to the former GDR 
citizens that even though a state had collapsed, their life 
achievements are not worthless. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Can the CDU still turn the helm around before 
the Bundestag elections? 
  [Eggert] I just hope that at the Hamburg party congress the 
CDU will make one thing clear: Solving material questions is 
worth more than preserving power at any cost. My experiences 
show that the voter punishes opportunism. He notices when he is 
made promises that cannot be kept. 
  [DIE WOCHE] Do you place your hopes on the chancellor? 
  [Eggert] It is not only me who is against pursuing the 
election campaign with just one man. I am far too much of a 
theologian not to know that a message can be spread only by many 
people. The more messengers there are, the more visible is the 
range of the messages.

opened its Bundestag election campaign with strong attacks 
against the SPD [Social Democratic Party], but at the same time 
indicating its willingness to cooperate [with the Social 
Democrats]. 
  Party executive spokesman Ludger Volmer [speaking at the 
party conference in Mannheim today] accused the SPD of wanting 
to move "toward the Right voluntarily." [passage omitted] 
  The SPD must no longer present itself as a "softie version" 
of the current government's policy. This would make it 
difficult for a red-green alliance to take power in Bonn. 
[passage omitted] 
  Volmer stressed that the Greens wanted to become the third 
strongest force, replace Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and end the 
CDU/CSU government. The Greens needed to make it clear that 
environmental reform policy cannot be made without them. The 
program for the Alliance 90/Greens election campaign focuses on 
economic environmental and social policy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "df": "FDP Now Has the Right of Sole </F>
Representation for `Social Market Economy'"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany 
[FDP] has taken note of the decisions of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] congress in Hamburg with interest, but 
without enthusiasm, Otto Count Lambsdorff, the economic policy 
spokesman of the FDP Bundestag group, said in an interview with 
HANDELSBLATT. "However, we are satisfied with the chancellor's 
clear statement that, if the voters so wish, he wants to 
continue the coalition with the FDP, and with his graphically 
formulated rejection of a grand coalition." If the CDU relies 
exclusively on Chancellor Kohl "and nothing else," this is 
exclusively its own business. 
  Lambsdorff notes with surprise that the CDU is willing to 
give up the internationally tested trademark of "social market 
economy." Ludwig Erhard would also be surprised, he says. "For 
me this results in a call on the FDP not to miss this 
opportunity. If the CDU speaks only of social and ecological 
market economy in the future, then the FDP should stick 
emphatically to the term `social market economy.'" 
  Its ecological commitment has always been undisputed; there 
has never been any doubt that "social" means consideration for 
man and also for the environment where man lives. The keyword 
of social market economy has such a positive connotation that 
one can only wonder which public relations agency or which party 
body recommended the CDU to give up this term. Even the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] already speaks of the social 
market economy, "but fortunately one believes them even less. 
I, personally, will do everything to pursue the 1994 election 
campaign with this term." 
  The fact that the chancellor's relationship with social 
market economy is a bit strange is nothing new, Lambsdorff 
noted. His repeated claim that he does not want to win the 
Ludwig-Erhard prize but the Bundestag elections makes it clear 
how incorrectly he assesses matters. Kohl does not know what 
Walter Eucken [economist, 1891-1950] called the interdependence 
of order: One cannot preach market economy in a party congress 
speech and, at the same time, say that agriculture, mining, and 
shipyards are excluded. 
  And one cannot, like Kohl, call for the restructuring of the 
social state and a change of thinking among the Germans and, at 
the same time, recommend raising the basic wages in the public 
sector and then present such an agreement as a pilot agreement 
for all other wage areas. "Raising basic wages always leads to 
basic unemployment." Kohl had better talk about the exemplary 
nature of the agreement for the chemical industry. 
<H5>  Incorrect Wage Recommendations for the Public Sector </H5>
  "Anything else I hear from the party congress and its 
economic policy decisions makes me wonder. When Mr. Goehner 
speaks of new values and an epochal change, I have no idea what 
that means if I do not get any further explanation. However, 
this is only a basic program, and, as is known, one can make 
exceptions from basic principles." 
  One must wait and see what is now going to happen in 
practice: Will privatizations really be carried out, in 
particular at the laender level, and will the federal post, for 
instance, really be changed in such a way that one can speak of 
privatization and deregulation in the sense of the opportunities 
for development of an industrial sector? 
  In tax policy it sounds good when one can hear in Hamburg 
that, on principle, indirect taxes -- "I ask, which ones?" -- 
are to be raised and direct taxes are to be lowered. However, 
when one looks at the insufficiently thought-out ideas that were 
presented at the coalition partner's election congress under the 
catch word of "family policy," one wonders whether, e.g. the 
additional burden of 17 to 30 billion German marks [DM] for the 
introduction of the "family splitting" should be financed from 
the increase in petroleum tax or in value-added tax? 
  Lambsdorff: "The question is already the answer: Of course, 
this is completely impossible." And the abolition or limitation 
of spouses' splitting to finance family splitting would require 
a restructuring of civilian and social law. 
  The CDU also wants to restructure the social state. 
"Everybody knows that the institutions of our social state, 
which are financed by contributions, are at least not 
unendangered. At the same time, the same CDU wants to introduce 
a nursing-care insurance that is financed by contributions from 
employers and employees. This is not a restructuring of the 
social state, but a further move forward into the social policy 
dead end." 
  All this is not convincing. However, it is not decisive for 
the election campaign, either. The election campaign is decided 
by the answers to the problem of unemployment. Saxon 
Minister-President Biedenkopf made an analytically remarkable 
contribution without, however, presenting any solutions. Jobs 
do not develop in the large companies, but in small and 
medium-sized companies. "In view of the development of labor 
costs in Germany, we cannot rely on the expectation that, 
investments will lead to more and new jobs to the usual extent. 
Everywhere investments are capital-intensive and are made in 
such a way that as little human labor as possible is used." 
<H5>  FDP Strictly Rejects a Technology Council </H5>
  Thus, jobs develop in the sphere of medium-sized companies, 
many social institutions, and in the service sector. Germany 
cannot become a country with just a tertiary sector, it must 
remain a production site. However, this production site will be 
operated by far fewer people than in the past. 
  One can compare the current structural development with the 
mechanization of agriculture 25 or 30 years ago, when labor was 
reduced there radically and was taken up by industry. A farm, 
which was worked by 20 people in the past, can now do with the 
labor of one family and one helper. Similar things are 
currently happening in the producing industry. "We cannot avoid 
this trend if we want to remain a high-wage country. And we 
must remain a high-wage country, if we want to more or less 
maintain our high social level." 
  Some comments made in Hamburg regarding industrial policy 
give reason for distrust. Thus, a technology council was 
recommended, for instance, which is strictly rejected by the FDP 
as a step toward a republic governed by commissars. The FDP 
does not want mixing responsibilities. No one in such a 
technology council -- no chancellor, no economics minister, no 
expert who gives advice there -- subsequently accepts 
responsibility if following this advice leads to bankruptcies 
and unemployment. Responsibility remains with the companies. A 
mere exchange of opinion and information between industry and 
companies is, of course, harmless [sentence as published]. 
  The fact that Heiner Geissler harshly attacked the SPD was 
very satisfying in Hamburg. The SPD is the actual opponent in 
this election campaign. The SPD's irresponsibility in foreign 
policy must be laid open. What Scharping sold as his party's 
attitude at the security conference, the former military defense 
conference, was as far away from the truth as the sky is from 
the earth. 
  And what the SPD is spreading in terms of economic policy 
ideas makes one thing quite clearly: "Voting for the SPD in 
1994 means voting for something extremely expensive." The 
citizens would suffer if the SPD implemented its tax policy 
slogans. 
  Scharping speaks of unjustified income and assets that could 
be removed by taxes. Lambsdorff: "Unjustified incomes are 
probably the interests from the state bonds of 
Rhineland-Palatinate; and unjustified assets are probably what 
children inherit from their parents." Whoever wants to put 
higher taxes on that, obviously has absolutely no idea of the 
connection between saving, capital formation, investments, and 
the resulting jobs. 
<H3>  Compared With the SPD, the CDU Is the Better Coalition 
Partner </H3>
  The SPD wants a higher inheritance tax, higher standard 
values of real estate property, and a higher property tax. In 
this case, the SPD's ironic election poster of the past "German 
worker, the SPD wants to take away your villa in Ticino!" might 
indeed become true. "If the SPD wins, the issue is not the villa 
in Ticino but the one-family house in Meckenheim. If higher 
standard values, higher land taxes, higher property tax, and 
higher inheritance tax coincide, then many of the little people 
will not be able to maintain their small house, which they built 
with great effort by means of saving for building purposes. The 
children will then have to sell their house so as to be able to 
pay inheritance tax. And this is precisely the opposite of what 
we need in Germany." 
  Thus, in Lambsdorff's view it is more important to deal with 
the SPD than to quarrel among each other. "The election 
campaign was officially opened in Hamburg. It will be decided 
in economic policy. Here the CDU is not necessarily our ideal 
as a coalition partner, but if I have the choice between a cold 
and pneumonia, I prefer the cold."

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F>
Ulrich Rosenbaum in Bonn; date not given: "This Was an 
Artificial Good Mood"] 
  [Text] [Rosenbaum] How do you assess the course of the 
Christian Democratic Union [CDU] congress? 
  [Verheugen] The CDU has provided another piece of evidence 
of its helplessness. It analyzes and criticizes matters, but it 
does not take the appropriate steps and, furthermore, it keeps 
silent about the fact that it is responsible for these matters. 
The people know very well who has ruled in Bonn for the past 11 
years. 
  [Rosenbaum] However, there is no doubt that Helmut Kohl was 
able to convey the mood for a new start.... 
  [Verheugen] This was an artificial good mood and nothing 
else but auto-suggestion. This party congress will not have any 
long-term effect. 
  [Rosenbaum] Are you underestimating Kohl's qualities as a 
fighter? 
  [Verheugen] We have known from the very start that he can 
and will fight. However, over the next few months the problems 
will catch up with him. Unemployment will rise. And the debts 
are assuming uncontrollable dimensions. Kohl's room for 
maneuver is increasingly narrowing. Therefore, it is no wonder 
that he tries to escape into topics of yesterday and the day 
before yesterday. 
  [Rosenbaum] How do you assess the CDU's basic program? 
  [Verheugen] We will analyze it with the appropriate 
attention. In general, I consider it a step backwards, because 
it does not look to the future but is just the imitation of 
failed government policy. I would called it moderate 
Thatcherism. And when I see how the working people have been 
pushed back, I am seriously worried about the CDU's character as 
a people's party. 
  [Rosenbaum] Are you overlooking that new statements -- for 
example, on the ecological market economy -- are indeed looking 
to the future? 
  [Verheugen] I would like to believe it, if one could hope 
that this will have any effects on practical policy. We will 
not spare the CDU this test. Government policy so far has 
contradicted that. 
  [Rosenbaum] The idea of family-splitting does not seem to be 
far away from the ideas of the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] to change spouses' splitting [for taxation 
purposes]. 
  [Verheugen] The SPD has repeatedly called for a fair 
equalization of families' burdens. It must be recognized that 
now the CDU, too, thinks that something has to be done in this 
respect. We want the abolition of tax allowances for children 
and a limitation of the advantages derived from splitting. 
Instead, child allowance should be paid for each child; we are 
thinking in terms of about 250 German marks. At the moment we 
are working on a procedure that could save a lot of 
administrative work: Child allowance would be directly deducted 
from payable tax. Nontax payers or those who pay very little 
tax would get the sum directly.

  [Text] Hamburg -- A quarrel has broken out between Bonn 
government parties Christian Social Union [CSU] and Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] over the date of a statement 
by the Liberals on a possible coalition after the Bundestag 
elections. CSU leader Waigel called on the FDP yesterday to make 
a statement in favor of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/CSU 
before presidential elections on 23 May. He threatened that, 
otherwise, he will wage an election campaign against the FDP. 
  FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer stressed that his party 
will only make a binding statement a few weeks prior to the 
Bundestag elections scheduled for 16 October. Waigel replied: 
"The FDP cannot afford an ambiguous policy on this issue." So 
far, its experiences with statements in favor of a coalition 
with the CDU/CSU were good. "Should the Liberals continue to 
hesitate, we will adopt a tough position and try to win over 
every supporter of the coalition in the election campaign." 
Waigel predicted that, in that case, "the FDP will have 
problems entering the Bundestag again." 
  GDR Secretary General Hoyer told Waigel in Bonn not to rack 
the brains of the FDP. "We alone and nobody else will make a 
decision concerning the time and the contents of a statement 
about a possible coalition."

<F P=106> [Report by "ban.": "`No New Debts and Taxes'"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 22 Feb -- In an address to the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] Party Council in Bonn on Tuesday [21 
February], SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping repeated his statement 
that, in its election program, the party would reject any 
increase in new net debts and any increase in rates and taxes. 
With a view to the SPD's election chances, Scharping defended 
his position -- which was developed in accordance with Deputy 
SPD Chairman Lafontaine -- against criticism from parts of the 
party's left wing. Yet, according to the chairman of the Party 
Council, Ringstorff, the session was characterized by broad 
agreement. Unlike the past, it was distinguished by the 
determination to concentrate on "essential" issues. The SPD 
will not be diverted from its course by attacks from the 
Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU], a 
course intended to shift the fight against unemployment to the 
center of the election campaign. Ringstorff said the criticism 
of the CDU/CSU to the SPD's past Germany policy showed that the 
CDU and CSU would prove to be "bad losers" after the election. 
In addition, in communities in eastern Germany, the CDU was not 
hesitating to enter into alliances with the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] against the SPD. 
  The spokesman for the "Frankfurt Circle," the group of 
left-wingers within the SPD, Von Larcher, warned against a 
"deflationary austerity policy." In view of the mass 
unemployment the SPD must not do without a policy of stimulating 
the economy. Also on behalf of other representatives from the 
party's left, Von Larcher called for a state "future investment 
program." In a second address, Scharping rejected the views of 
the party's left-wingers. Before, at their meeting in 
Oer-Erkenschwick at the weekend, Scharping had criticized their 
catalogue of demands by emphasizing that, in its economic 
policy, the SPD must not bank on state measures alone. Even 
representatives of the party's left showed that they were 
impressed by Scharping's claim to leadership on Friday. 
  The Party Council avoided a discussion on differences 
between 
Lafontaine and Presidium Member Dressler in connection with 
pension policy. These differences were sparked off by 
Lafontaine's remark that the pensioners might have to suffer a 
loss in income in real terms depending on the result of the wage 
agreements. Dressler had then demanded that, if necessary, the 
pensioners be entitled to compensation measures; yet, 
fundamentally, he did not want to challenge the "pension 
formula." Lafontaine brought up reservations in terms of 
finance policy and described Dressler's position as an 
"individual inconsiderate opinion." According to members of the 
SPD leadership, the SPD Executive Committee did not finally 
close the matter in its discussion on Monday. 
  The leadership of the Party Council was confirmed in its 
offices. However, with 34 votes, Chairman Ringstorff received 
significantly fewer votes than his deputies Poss (55) and Mrs. 
Weber (51). The bad result for the chairman of the SPD land 
group of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania was explained by the way 
in which he did his job so far. In the past debates on asylum 
policy, he once published a list, which later turned out to be 
wrong, on supporters of and opponents to a Basic Law amendment. 
Only about half of the 110 members of the Party Council 
attended the session in Bonn. It was said that due to heavy 
snowfalls and difficult road conditions the remaining members 
were unable to attend the meeting; their absence, however, also 
proves the importance of this party body within the party: The 
Party Council is not a decisionmaking body but only a 
consultative one. 
  SPD Federal Manager Verheugen presented the Party Council 
with a paper on fighting right-wing extremism. The fight 
against right-wing extremism must be stepped up. They have to 
be stripped of the false image of "respectability." The 
behavior of those who officially represent the party should be 
the subject of public debate.

<F P=106> [Report by "lz": "Loss of Confidence in the East"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin -- Shortly after the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] gathered new strength at its party congress in 
Hamburg, it received a cold shower in eastern Germany: The east 
German voters, a majority of whom still supported the 
CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] four years ago, gave Kohl's 
party the cold shoulder at the beginning of the super election 
year. According an Infratest poll (1,117 persons polled, 
conclusion of poll on 14 February), support for the CDU between 
Ruegen and the Erz Mountains has dropped to 14 percent. Thus, 
the party is only sightly ahead of the successor party of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED], the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS]. At 24 percent, the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] received the best rating, but it also trails far 
behind the group of frustrated citizens who do not have positive 
feelings for any party (37 percent). 
  A dramatic loss of confidence was also observed concerning 
the question of competence. Only every second east German 
believes that the parties can resolve major problems, including 
unemployment, internal security, and the adaptation of the 
eastern level to the western. As far as the parties are 
concerned, the SPD has a lead over the CDU. Regarding 
unemployment, the ratio is 30 to 15. On the issue of social 
security, the CDU trails behind the PDS. 
  Observers view these figures, which do not yet determine the 
outcome of the elections, as a serious sign of helplessness. In 
addition, the economic and social problems resulting from the 
restructuring of the collapsing east German economy are not 
blamed on the SED but on the democratic parties. 
  The question concerning the most convincing politician makes 
that clear: At 71 percent, Brandenburg's Minister for Social 
Affairs Regine Hildebrandt tops the list, followed by Saxon 
Minister-President Kurt Biedenkopf and Brandenburg 
Minister-President Manfred Stolpe. Ms. Hildebrandt's strategy 
is to present people in the new laender as those who are always 
discriminated against. Her often-used slogan "We must not put 
up with this," makes her the most popular politician in east 
Germany. Politicians, however, who seek reconciliation can rely 
on less support: Wolfgang Thierse (33), Angela Merkel (24), and 
Bernhard Vogel (23). Even Helmut Kohl, the chancellor of German 
unity, did not receive more than 23 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by "phe": "Economies in Space Research Planned"] </F>
  [Text] Duesseldorf -- If it forms the government after the 
Bundestag elections, the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] will want to focus state research policy on aiding more 
environmentally conscious, less hazardous, and cheaper forms of 
energy, the development of a modern transportation system, and a 
"first-rate telecommunications structure." The "research 
department" should make economies in defense technology, space 
projects, and nuclear research. 
  That is what emerges from the draft "1994 Government 
Program" 
in the fields of education, research, and culture, for which 
Peter Glotz, the education and research policy spokesman of the 
SPD, is responsible as the member of the SPD commission for 
these fields. 
  According to the document, the SPD wants to make education, 
research, and culture policy a "big issue" in the election 
campaign debate. In order to make education and research policy 
more effective, the SPD -- like the CDU -- is proposing the 
establishment of an "innovation and technology council." The 
appointment of a "education council as a forum for exchanging 
ideas" is also being considered. 
  The document calls for a "generation contract for education 
and youth" in order to "realize the right to the best possible 
education for the new generation." However, how that is to be 
understood remains unclear. The SPD flatly rejects a reduction 
in training subsidies. Ultimately, the SPD wants to make the 
transition from vocational training to a college education 
easier, the Law on Training Subsidies an effective instrument 
for an active labor market policy, and overcome resistance to 
"the good idea of training during vacations." 
  The SPD is a firm advocate of "effective reforms" of the 
college sector, such as increasing the room for maneuver of 
individual colleges by, for example, introducing overall 
budgets. The program states literally that "private colleges 
could complement our college system in a positive way." 
  The document states that "we must differentiate between what 
is first-rate, average, and bad in our society and in education 
and science all the more so." Glotz says: "Even the most 
stringent economies cannot lead to the neglect of what is first 
rate." The details of the draft state: 

  -  The SPD believes 
that more consideration must be given to education in the 
distribution of public funds than has been the case hitherto. 
There should be a "reasonable" increase in expenditure on 
education and science as a share of the gross national 
expenditure. 
  -  The SPD is in favor of companies and administrative 
agencies developing professional career structures that also 
afford opportunities for specialists without a college education 
to advance their careers. 
  -  Priority should be given to the 
expansion of technical colleges. There should be better career 
opportunities in public service for graduates. 
  -  In the opinion of 
the SPD, there should be an "above average" increase in funds 
for research as of 1995. 
  -  The SPD documents state explicitly that 
technological progress in information technology, the 
development of new materials, genetic engineering, and the whole 
range of chemical, biological, and physics-based technologies is 
the basis for prosperity and economic competitiveness. Research 
policy should not be "too narrow"; it should identify new 
technologies that have a "marked structural effect" early in 
conjunction with the scientific and business communities and 
accord special priority to such projects. The SPD describes the 
"marketplace" as providing an "important impetus" for 
technological progress.

<F P=106> [Report by "ban": "Agreement on Principle, Dissention on </F>
Details"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 24 Feb -- The Bundestag on Thursday [24 
February] held the first hearing on the packages of law proposed 
by the coalition and the Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] on combating crime. After the debate, the drafts were 
sent on to the committees. Speakers of all parliamentary groups 
attributed great importance to internal security and announced 
that they are looking for agreement on the less controversial 
details of the article laws. The deputies concentrated on the 
differences between the drafts. Speakers of the Christian 
Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] regretted that 
the coalition draft does not envisage the possibility to monitor 
conversations in apartments to combat organized crime, but they 
called the respective formulations in the SPD draft 
impracticable. The coalition said the SPD's demand that assets 
be temporarily impounded when there is just well-founded 
suspicion that they were acquired by criminal activities is 
unconstitutional. The SPD, for its part, accused the coalition 
of wanting to blur the borders between the intelligence services 
and the police in a constitutionally alarming way by giving the 
Federal Intelligence Office (BND) powers of investigation 
against organized crime. 
  Interior Minister Kanther (CDU) said that with its draft law 
the coalition proves that it is able to act. Effective policy 
for internal security is the "best contribution" against 
extremist parties. The opening of the borders in Europe gives 
rise to crime in Germany. Kanther explained the coalition's 
article law, on which the CDU/CSU and the Free Democratic Party 
of Germany [FDP] agreed in January after protracted 
negotiations. Criminal proceedings should be accelerated and 
the detention law should become "more effective." Penal 
provisions about instigating people and using Nazi-like symbols 
should be expanded. It should be possible to impose higher 
sentences for bodily injury. It should be an "imperative" 
provision of the law that adult foreign drug dealers be expelled 
from the country. The regulation on turning state's evidence 
should be transferred to organized crime. In the case of the 
extortion of protection money, higher fines should be imposed. 
The BND should be permitted to pass on findings on organized 
crime, which are gained through monitoring international 
telephone conversations, to the responsible authorities. 
Kanther said: "Unfortunately, the electronic monitoring of 
conversations in apartments is not included in the package of 
laws." He will continue to advocate it. 
  On behalf of the SPD, Deputy Group Chairwoman Anke Fuchs 
said 
that the coalition has neglected to hit organized crime at its 
"never," namely at its profits and assets. Saying this, Mrs. 
Fuchs justified her group's proposal that not a court sentence 
but already justified suspicion should be sufficient for 
impounding assets, which have perhaps been gained by criminal 
activities. Then the suspect should be forced to prove that he 
gained the assets legally. Illegal profits must not be 
introduced in the legal economic cycle just because 
investigations are too slow. Therefore, the SPD proposes and 
amendment to Basic Law Article 14 (guarantee of property). 
However, her group knows that this would mean stepping on 
"juridical virgin soil." Mrs. Fuchs as well as SPD legal expert 
De With rejected the coalition's planned extension of the 
regulation on turning state's evidence as well as additional 
powers for the BND. Other projects of the coalition 
(perpetrator-victim compensation, stricter punishment for bodily 
injury, ban of neo-Nazi symbols) are supported by the SPD group. 
  FDP legal expert Kleinert said that everything that the SPD 
did not take over from the coalition is "abstruse." With it 
proposals for impounding assets, the SPD is crossing the "limits 
of a rule-of-law state." Kleinert paid tribute to the coalition 
draft. The differences of opinion on monitoring conversations 
in apartments did not lead to blockades in other fields. FRG 
Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger demanded that the 
laender reinforce their police forces. The planned laws must 
not give the impression that the state has been defenseless so 
far. 
  Party of Democratic Socialism Deputy Gysi accused the SPD of 
using its draft law so as not to expose itself to the coalition 
in the election campaign regarding internal security. The 
coalition and the SPD want to restrict basic rights. Just as 
the coalition, Gysi criticized the SPD's proposals for 
impounding assets. Shifting the burden of proof weakens the 
citizen. The social reasons of crime must be eliminated, Gysi 
said. 
  Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein (CSU) paid tribute to 
the coalition draft as a piece of progress, but he noted that it 
does not live up to the threat posed by organized crime. It 
must be possible to monitor the apartments of heavy criminals. 
Covert investigators must be permitted to commit 
"milieu-related" crimes. Beckstein called for life terms for 
"gang-like organized drug dealing." The constitutional 
protection authorities should be involved in watching organized 
crime.
