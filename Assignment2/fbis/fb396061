<F P=106> [Article by J.M. Bik: "G-7 Outlining Requirements for Aid to </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The seven major Western industrialized 
nations (G-7) are willing to continue to support Russia only if 
it pursues its reform process and shows some tangible results. 
According to the G-7, the world economy is evolving reasonably 
well, mostly thanks to the recovery in the United States, 
Canada, and Great Britain. In France and Italy, privatization 
programs should rev up the economy, while in Japan deregulation 
and an announced stimulation program should do the same. 
  These were the conclusions of the talks between the finance 
ministers and bank governors from the G-7 countries, which were 
concluded in the German city of Kronberg last weekend. On 
behalf of Russia, which attended the meeting as an observer and 
the main beneficiary of aid, Finance Minister Dubinin came to 
Kronberg. His delegation received many critical questions 
regarding the progress of the Russian reform process. In a 
nine-point statement, the G-7 states that Russian "goodwill" has 
shown "insufficient results." Dubinin had announced that Russia 
wants to push back the monthly inflation rate from 20 percent 
now, to between 6 and 9 percent by the end of 1994. The budget 
deficit should be maximum 5 percent of the GNP by then, which 
Dubinin considered to be "quite feasible." Reactions to his 
statements were sceptical, due to the success of the former 
communists and ultranationalists in Russia's recent elections. 
  Aids of German Minister Theo Waigel reported that U.S. 
Finance Minister Lloyd Bentson's attitude had been very 
standoffish during the talks on the continuation of aid to 
Moscow, because of the commotion around the Russian CIA spy 
exposed last week. An important part of the $55-billion aid 
agreed in 1992 and 1993, has not yet been provided, including 
$10 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and $4.5 
billion (out of 5 billion) from the World Bank. 
  Host Waigel made it clear that his country, which has 
provided two-thirds of all Western aid (almost 100 billion 
German marks) since 1989, for the time being must ease up 
because of its own economic problems. Anyway, Waigel believes 
an extension of aid is not necessary right now, although he 
labelled the situation of the Russian economy as "infinitely 
intricate." 
  European Commissioner Henning Christophersen stated that the 
European Union is considering the possibility of creating a 
free-trade area with Russia by 1998. However, a prior condition 
for opening up the West European market to Russian products is 
still that Moscow should guarantee the fixing of realistic 
market prices and that subsidies to companies should be lifted, 
a demand which is also applicable to other East European 
countries.

  [Excerpts] During a visit to the Rivolto air base, in 
Friuli, Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri spoke about the shooting 
down of the Serb planes and diplomatic reactions to the 
incident, especially from Russia. Tino Zava reports. 
  [Tino Zava, voice over video] NATO is not a rusty machine -- 
on the contrary, it is an organization capable of acting with 
great timeliness and efficiency. According to Defense Minister 
Fabio Fabbri, this is demonstrated by what happened in Bosnia 
yesterday, where NATO and the United Nations had much of their 
credibility at stake. He said that the incident at Banja Luka 
was sad but inevitable. [passage omitted] 
  Is there any possibility of reprisals against Italy, where 
the U.S. F-16's set out from? Fabbri promised that we would 
monitor the situation closely. 
  [Fabbri] The protective shield created by NATO is able to 
warn us of any movement from that territory that might 
constitute a threat against our territory. 
  [Zava] Fabbri praised Russia's stance over the Banja Luka 
incident, and then spoke about Italy's new defense plan. There 
will be more fighter planes rather than missiles.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe has welcomed NATO's actions in the Bosnian conflict. 
Ruehe was commenting to the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group in Bonn today on 
the shooting down of four Serb aircraft by U.S. fighters over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Peace could only be achieved if the 
decisions made by the United Nations were implemented. The Serb 
aircraft had violated the UN no-fly zone. 
  Ruehe described it as "right" that German soldiers had been 
on board the AWACS reconnaisance aircraft during the mission. 
He said he was satisfied that the German Government had decided 
in favor of the participation of German soldiers in the 
reconnaisance flights.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe editorial: "The Attack by the `Falcons'"] </F>
  [Text] It was the first time in its history that NATO had 
fired shots at someone: Not at the Soviet Union but at a 
country that did not even exist during the Cold War, namely 
Serbia. Why now, and why out of the blue? 
  In fact, NATO registered a thousand violations of the flight 
ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina since it was imposed by the United 
Nations in November 1992. Even after it was tightened about one 
year ago, that is after the adoption of UN resolution 816, which 
threatened the use of force, the infringements of the air space 
continued to take place regularly. The alliance has registered 
approximately 500 violations so far, but it did not attack the 
intruders. Why did it do so now? 
  If rulers like Bismarck and Talleyrand were still shaping 
foreign policy today instead of men like Kinkel, Christopher, or 
Hurd, one might picture an extremely subtle game behind the 
scenes. The story begins on 17 February, 100 hours before the 
expiration of the ultimatum against the Serbs in Sarajevo. All 
of a sudden, Russia appears on the scene like a deus ex machina, 
dragging the Serbs by the collar. There is no longer any need 
for the ultimatum and bombs because the Serbs promised to 
withdraw their heavy artillery according to schedule. 
  This was good for Sarajevo but not so good for NATO and the 
United States, because the alliance had labored in vain and 
Washington had to watch how the old and seemingly toothless 
rival was suddenly pulling all the strings. For four decades, 
the West had tried successfully (with Tito's help) to keep 
Soviet influence out of the Adriatic. Now Moscow was the 
mastermind, the "lead in the tumbler," as Bismarck used to 
describe the role of the German Reich. NATO was neutralized, 
and the Russians -- half protectors and half conquerors of the 
Serbs -- showed that they alone directed the play. 
  Cynics might now believe that the downing of the Serbian 
Jastrebs ("hawks") which attacked Bosnian ground targets earlier 
represents an elegant Western countermove. Thus, the operation 
of the U.S. F- 16 Falcons might be viewed as a signal that NATO 
is still in charge. It was as difficult for the Russians to 
protest against this move as it was for the NATO allies to 
reject the coup of the Kremlin two weeks ago. After all, Moscow 
voted in favor of the flight ban, supported by a threat of 
violence, together with all other members of the Security 
Council on 31 March 1933. 
  Yet this is mere fantasy -- at least this is what NATO 
claims. The downing was merely a matter of routine. The F-16 
pilots did not even have to consult anybody because the rules 
adopted by the United Nations stipulate clearly that shots can 
be fired after two warnings. Why were the shots fired now? 
Because the NATO planes were always "in the wrong place at the 
wrong time" in the past. Or: Because it was usually helicopters 
that were involved, which landed immediately. 
  One party that does not believe in the theory about the 
routine operation are the Serbs. They immediately sent their 
own signals -- in the form of heavy shelling of the Muslim 
enclave of Tuzla. The conclusion is that the world rejoiced too 
soon. After the withdrawal of the Serbian guns from Sarajevo, 
some problems seemed to dissolve. The Serbs hinted for the 
first time that they might become sensible, and the Muslims and 
Croatians started to talk with each other again. Yet the most 
recent cease-fire between the two groups has again collapsed, 
and the use of the Serbian jets shows that the tactical 
withdrawal has by no means changed the overall strategy of the 
Serbs. 
  For this reason, NATO "reported back" -- drastically but 
regularly. The rapid approval from Bonn and Paris underlines 
that there is no dissent within the alliance. Still: A 
seemingly insuperable threshold was crossed with this attack. 
Thus, a new chapter has begun in the two-year-old Bosnian drama. 
  Only one thing is certain: Although the Serbs showed their 
readiness for escalation with the decision to attack Tuzla, they 
will not be able to keep it up. The U.S. aircraft carrier 
Saratoga is already moving toward the Adriatic to make this 
clear. Yet he who takes the first step must know what the 
second should be. Violence on a regular basis -- once here, once 
there? This would be no military problem for the alliance but a 
political one. One reason is that Russia is a member of the 
Security Council, and that the Serbs will be clever enough to 
avoid such a clear provocation. 
  With the F-16 operation, the West has drawn level with 
Moscow 
in the political power game. This creates on opportunity to 
test a joint strategy. As the protectors of the Serbs as it 
were, the Russian possess a degree of influence that the West 
does not have. If Washington and Moscow curbed their rekindled 
rivalry in favor of cooperation in the Balkans, they might 
succeed in bringing the Serbs to their senses (on the basis of 
the threat of violence). Bonn would have to play a similarly 
disciplined role vis-a-vis the Croatians who firmly believe that 
the Germans will block all sanctions against them. Is this 
unrealistic? Maybe, it is. However, even the best F-16 planes 
cannot create a modus vivendi by firing shots.

<F P=106> [Klaus C. Engelen Commentary: "Waigel's Home Match"] </F>
  [Text] The contrast could hardly have been any sharper: In 
Kronberg last Saturday [26 February], the finance ministers and 
central bank heads of the seven leading industrial nations were 
discussing the state of the reform process in the center of the 
former Soviet Union with a high-level Russian government 
delegation. At the same time, in Moscow, prominent coup leaders 
were leaving prison, cheered by old communists and 
ultranationalists. 
  The release of the coup leaders and the expected further 
strengthening of Russian forces opposed to reforms following 
therefrom are making it increasingly doubtful whether the 
concept of help for self-help that was developed at the Munich 
1992 summit and further detailed at the Tokyo 1993 summit, can 
remain valid. The meeting of the Group of Seven finance 
ministers that was chaired by Finance Minister Theo Waigel and 
focused on Russia -- quite expectedly -- did not find an answer 
to this question, either for Russia or for the world. The 
promises by the ministers flown in from Moscow saying that 
monthly inflation will remain below 10 percent this year and the 
budget deficit will be cut to 5 percent of the GNP, did not make 
any change to that. 
  But by publishing its nine-item declaration the Group of 
Seven -- plus the head of the International Monetary Fund and 
the Deputy Heads of the World Bank and the European Union -- 
once again made it clear: The Western industrial nations will 
continue supporting the economic reform process in Russia as 
long as the necessary preconditions are met. 
  Since only a fraction of the billion-dollar aid packages 
granted so far has actually been effected to date as a result of 
the out-of-control inflation rate and public finances, the 
providing of additional financial means could not be a topic at 
Kronberg. But the Round of Seven -- after comprehensive 
consultations with the Russian Government -- emphasized a new 
line at Kronberg: to help develop a credible program for social 
support of the reform process. In fact, the West could do very 
much in this respect, not only through international 
institutions such as the World Bank, but also in the form of 
bilateral aid. 
  Although Russia's reform crisis was at the center of the 
Kronberg meeting, the German hosts had to make a considerable 
effort to contain -- at least for the conference weekend -- the 
tensions between Washington and Tokyo that were triggered by 
better access to the Japanese market. An open confrontation 
between Japanese and Americans would have made the Germans look 
bad. But as chief coordinator of the West's aid for Russia and 
as proclaimer of a brightening world economy -- including a 
better economic outlook in Germany -- the strained Bonn 
treasurer Theo Waigel, at the beginning of the super election 
year, managed to enter the small Kronberg G-7 summit in his 
books as a successful home match.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen by </F>
Milos Sklenka; place and date not given: "The Liberalization of 
Trade Is the European Union's Best Contribution to the Success 
of the Reforms"] 
  [Text] Denmark is one of the most enthusiastic supporters 
of the gradual incorporation of the Central and East European 
states into the integrative structures. It is no coincidence 
that it was under this country's presidency of the European 
Union [EU] during the first half of last year that the Twelve 
announced publicly for the first time that they are prepared to 
accept states from this region in the future. At the same time, 
it liberalized to a greater extent its internal market for East 
European exports. One of the men who deserved much of the 
credit for the progress in rapprochement between East and West 
on the old continent was Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen. He granted our newspaper an exclusive interview in 
connection with his visit to the Czech Republic. 
  [Sklenka] The NATO member countries approved the Partnership 
for Peace [PFP] initiative at their recent summit. In what 
specific way should the Alliance's plan improve security and 
stability in Europe? 
  [Petersen] The approval of the PFP initiative can be 
described as the most important decision made at the NATO summit 
in January, because its aim is to unite the whole of Europe. 
The essence of the plan embraces support for practical military 
and political cooperation, cooperation that reflects the various 
endeavors and abilities of each signatory country, while 
involvement in the initiative is open to any country interested 
in it. In this regard, the PFP eliminates in advance the 
possibility of Europe being divided and helps to increase 
stability, confidence, and security. The North Atlantic 
Alliance's initiative, however, should not be viewed 
independently, but as an element of the West's broader concept 
for bolstering peace and improving cooperation and security in 
Europe. For example, the EU recently came up with a plan for a 
so-called Stability Pact, whose ultimate aim is the same. 
  [Sklenka] Some of the most senior representatives of the 
countries of Central and East Europe, nevertheless, point out 
that, although the initiative de facto brings the postwar 
division of Europe to an end, NATO could have offered something 
more than just consultations and joint exercises. 
  [Petersen] The PFP plan is based on the real requirements of 
the current era in Europe. It would be erroneous to think that 
this initiative offers only formal consultations, joint 
exercises, and so on. It is necessary, first and foremost, to 
be aware of the very crux of the plan, that is, that the PFP 
represents an important element in filling the security vacuum 
for the countries of Central and East Europe. The mechanism for 
consultations -- which enables any participating country to 
discuss with NATO issues that present a threat to it, 
infringements of territorial integrity, and political 
independence -- forms an important part of their security 
system. As far as guaranteeing their security is concerned, the 
East European countries may, apart from this, also count on 
close political and economic cooperation with the EU by means of 
the association agreements. 
  [Sklenka] In your opinion, when will the time be right to 
expand the Alliance? 
  [Petersen] The heads of state and government of the NATO 
member countries declared quite unequivocally at the January 
summit that the Alliance is open to all European countries. It 
says in the final declaration, among other things, that "we 
expect and welcome the opportunity to expand NATO." Denmark 
supports the attempts by the countries of Central and East 
Europe to join the Alliance. Nevertheless, we are of the opinion 
that this process must be gradual, while we consider involvement 
in the PFP initiative to be an intermediate stage toward full 
membership in NATO. In no way, however, do we view it as a 
guarantee of their membership. 
  [Sklenka] Apart from the expansion of political and security 
cooperation, the Central and East European states are also 
seeking cooperation in trade. They are demanding greater access 
to the common EU market. 
  [Petersen] I fully agree with the view that favorable 
economic development in Central and East Europe is one of the 
conditions for boosting security and stability in this region. 
In this regard, Denmark is trying to help to increase as much 
as possible the access of Central and East European exporters to 
the EU market. We are absolutely convinced that the 
liberalization of trade is the best contribution to the success 
of local political and economic reforms. Our government put 
forward certain specific measures at the Copenhagen conference 
last April, the aim of which was to increase their closer trade 
cooperation with the EU. The results of the conference became a 
springboard for the Copenhagen summit in June where the Twelve 
further liberalized their market for imports from the countries 
of this region. 
  [Sklenka] The Czech Republic and five of the region's other 
countries have signed association agreements with the EU. These 
are the first step on the road toward full membership in this 
organization. In your opinion, when would it be realistic for 
the Union to begin expanding eastwards? 
  [Petersen] In accordance with a decision made by the 
European Council, the EU should be expanded on 1 January 1995. 
Following the probable admission of the four candidate countries 
-- Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway -- more talks will be 
held on possible institutional changes and the admission of 
other new countries at the intergovernmental conference in 1996. 
Talks on the admission of Central and East European countries 
into the EU could begin in 1997. The length of the negotiations 
and the speed of the actual process of their incorporation will 
be individual and based on the readiness of each country. It 
seems to me that there is a realistic chance of expanding the 
Union again at the turn of the century at the earliest. 
Naturally, Denmark will support -- as it has done until now -- 
closer cooperation between the Twelve and Central and East 
Europe. 
  [Sklenka] The association agreements for Hungary and Poland 
came into effect in February following a two-year ratification 
procedure. How long could this take in our case? 
  [Petersen] As you know, Denmark was one of the first EU 
countries to ratify -- in December 1993 -- the Czech Republic's 
association agreement. I believe that the approval procedure in 
all the EU member states will be completed by the end of this 
year so that the document can come into effect on 1 January 
1995. Irrespective of this, however, the Czech Republic has a 
valid Interim Agreement, which encompasses all the economic and 
trade issues contained in the association agreement, including 
greater access to the EU market for Czech goods. 
  [Sklenka] The negotiations on expanding the EU to include 
Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway have reached the final 
stage after more than a year. As a result of the continuing 
differences of opinion on the speed of their adaptation to 
conditions in the Union, however, there is a real risk that the 
date of their admission will not be adhered to. 
  [Petersen] According to the original timetable, the talks 
should be completed by tomorrow, if expansion is to be achieved 
by 1 January 1995. In this context, all the EU states are 
approaching the talks with the utmost understanding for the 
demands of the other side and with an effort at compromise. In 
the event that this does not happen, there is a real risk that 
the planned date will not be adhered to. In view of the June 
elections, the mandate of the European Parliament deputies -- 
who must also ratify the agreements on the admission of new 
countries into the EU -- will come to an end. 
  [Sklenka] What is your assessment of the current state of 
cooperation between the Czech Republic and Denmark? 
  [Petersen] I consider bilateral Czech-Danish relations to be 
very good. During the past few years, we have succeeded in 
forging very close cooperation on all levels, which has carried 
mutual cooperation forward onto a qualitatively new perspective. 
I believe that my official visit to the Czech Republic is 
confirmation of this positive trend. 
  [Sklenka] How satisfied are you with the participation of 
Danish companies in privatization in the Czech Republic and in 
our market in general? 
  [Petersen] The privatization process in the Czech Republic 
has made considerable progress. Many Danish enterprises are 
monitoring developments in your country with great interest; 
some of them have even become actively involved in 
privatization. For example, Dansk Eternir Fabrik, which is a 
subsidiary of the largest industrial group in the country, F. L. 
Smidth, has established a special investment fund for Central 
and East Europe through which it is taking part in a number of 
joint enterprises. In the Czech Republic it is involved in 11 
joint ventures, including ventures with EZ Beroun and EZA 
Sumperk. At the moment, approximately 60 Danish companies -- 
whose activity is focused mainly on trade, industry, and 
consultancy -- are operating on the Czech market. Denmark 
considers the Czech Republic to be a very important potential 
partner for developing economic cooperation, which underscores 
the increasing interest shown by our companies in investing in 
your country.

  [Text] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Immigration into most of the 
developed countries of North America, Europe and Asia has fallen 
off in what could mark a "turning point" in global migration, 
the OECD reported Thursday [3 March]. 
  But it added that the potential remains for new bursts of 
migration, notably by people seeking to escape the turmoil 
caused by political change in the former Soviet bloc, the 
organization said Thursday. 
  The 24-nation Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, in its annual report on global migration trends, 
said that with the exception of Germany, Sweden and the United 
States, immigration into OECD countries fell off in 1992 and the 
first part of 1993, the latest period covered by the survey. 
  It said the changes "seem to mark a turning point in 
migration." 
  The report suggested various reasons for the decline, 
including the economic recession and subsequent fall in the need 
for fresh immigrant labour and government measures to combat the 
abuse of political asylum rights. 
  But it added that the changes could mark "merely a cyclical 
downturn unlikely to have a fundamental effect on the 
acceleration of international migration," and said it "would 
seem premature to suggest that the trend has been definitively 
reversed." 
  The report said that while economic and population 
imbalances 
between North and South remained the main cause of migration, 
political change in the former Soviet bloc had become a 
contributing factor. 
  Transition to a market economy in that region was "a 
completely unfamiliar process whose effects, especially 
increased unemployment, may have an impact on migration." 
  While noting that the "great East-West exodus feared by some 
has not so far taken place," the report said the crisis in 
former Yugoslavia "has triggered substantial unforeseen 
population movements." 
  It also said that Central and East Europe and the former 
Soviet Union had "considerable migratory potential, fuelled by 
economic and political change as well as social and ethnic 
tension." 
  The transition to a market economy was having contradictory 
effects, the OECD said. "The political motivations for leaving 
are gradually disappearing but the re-establishment of freedom 
of movement, rising levels of unemployment and persistently high 
income differentials between East and West encourage emigration, 
especially among the most highly qualified," the report said. 
  The report went on to say that over a very short space of 
time, OECD countries had been confronted with "all the different 
forms" of population movement -- migration by ethnic minorities, 
migration for work and family reasons, temporary or seasonal and 
frontier migration, movement of asylum-seekers and the return 
home of former emigrants. 
  The OECD groups West European nations, the United States, 
Canada, Australia and Japan. 
  Migration trends are causing concern in almost all the OECD 
countries, with some continuing to receive high levels of 
applications for asylum, the report said. 
  The number of applications in Germany in 1992, totalling 
440,000, was entirely exceptional, exceeding the number of 
applications in the same year in all the other European OECD 
members, it noted. 
  It said that in their efforts to deal with "the 
ever-increasing scale" of population movements, the migration 
policies of some OECD states were facing "a crisis of 
legitimacy." 
  The report cautioned that widespread illegal migration and 
the growing numbers of asylum seekers were blurring some 
governments' judgement of the differences between various 
categories of migrants -- asylum seekers, refugees, family 
reunification, students, workers and tourists. 
  If the legitimacy of migration policies is to be 
strengthened, the OECD said, there needs to be more effective 
control of flows of all types of migration. 
  Possible measures include tighter border surveillance, more 
checks within countries and extended visa requirements, it said. 
  But several countries have complained about the speed with 
which migrants and employers adapt to whatever restrictions were 
imposed to combat illegal employment. 
  Whenever much tighter controls were introduced, the report 
said, the clandestine crossing of frontiers gave way to entry 
either with forged papers or as tourists.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with European Commissioner Karel Van </F>
Miert by Wim Brummelman; place and date not given: "Van Miert 
Fears for Europe"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 26 February -- European Commissioner Karel 
Van Miert (aged 52), is not exactly optimistic about cooperation 
in Europe. Recently, as the man responsible for competition 
policy, he has noticed how the recession has fanned the flames 
of nationalistic tendencies in Europe once again. "Regardless 
of the political color of the government, we are seeing that the 
longer the pressure goes on, the less easy it is to withstand 
the temptation to simply give government support in one way or 
another when a particular company is threatened with bankruptcy 
or a specific sector is threatened with difficulties." 
  Van Miert merely sees the problems facing European 
cooperation mounting up further over the next few years. He 
fears the European Union (EU) risks being ripped apart in the 
discussion on "enlargement" or "consolidation." Now already, it 
often is so difficult to maintain even slight coherence in the 
EU's approach. So what will the situation be like in the near 
future when the four new member states -- Norway, Sweden, 
Finland, and Austria -- have joined, each with their own 
specific demands and sensitivities, or when subsequently, over 
the following few years, further enlargements appear on the 
agenda, e.g., involving Malta? 
  Van Miert entertains serious misgivings about this. He 
predicts that if the EU soldiers on like it is doing at present 
-- clinging frantically to the present hybrid structure of the 
EU in which some decisions are made at Community level with a 
majority, while others are the result of negotiations between 
the member states which require unanimity -- then definitely it 
will sink further into the morass of indecisiveness and 
impotence. 
  If the EU does not strengthen drastically its decisionmaking 
mechanism, it will preprogram its "own disintegration," 
reiterated the European commissioner several times during the 
interview. He believes already there have been various 
indications pointing toward disintegration, rather than 
integration. "Finally the time has come to stare the problem in 
the face," he said. 
  Van Miert believes it is of fundamental importance to the 
functioning of the EU that a breakthrough be made in the current 
situation, where even a single member state can block 
decisionmaking in Brussels. That would mean departing from the 
principle of unanimity. Moreover, this immediately would throw 
up the question as to whether each member state, large or small, 
in the future should still continue to have to designate its own 
candidate for the European Commission. At present there are 17 
members of the Commission, but this number will rise to 21 when 
Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Austria accede. 
  Van Miert agrees with those critics who maintain that such 
"mechanical" enlargement will go ahead at the cost of 
efficiency. He believes an executive body of around 15 members 
is sufficient. "If we progress toward having 20 or more, then 
that will complicate matters here even further. As a result, 
the various areas of responsibility would have to be divided up 
even further, and you know what people say: The more members a 
government comprises, the more bickering goes on, and the longer 
business takes. So I do not consider it to be a positive 
development. However, you then run up against the problem that 
lies at the heart of the matter: As long as the rule dictates 
that every member state must have at least one member of the 
Commission, you will automatically see the Commission's 
enlargement. I find the desirability of such a trend highly 
questionable, but changing things would inevitably mean moving 
away from a principle that is regarded as virtually sacred by 
all the member states." 
  Agreement has been reached within the EU that such 
institutional questions will be avoided for the time being. 
Indeed, they will only feature on the agenda in 1996, when the 
Maastricht Treaty will be taken a step further. By then, a 
formula must be found for settling relations between the small 
and large member states within the various European bodies. 
  The question is whether the EU really can afford such a 
repetition of the debate on Maastricht, given the competing 
interests and views of the member states. "If another debate is 
going to be allowed to proceed in the classical manner, then I 
fear it will go on forever." For that reason, Van Miert 
proposes a radical solution: The member states must go ahead 
with negotiations on the desired mode of organization of the EU 
which also involves the European Parliament (EP). The result 
then should be put to a referendum, but not in the same way as 
happened with the Maastricht Treaty, where a Danish "No" 
succeeded in bringing the whole procedure to a standstill. 
  Van Miert says: "Put the result to the entire population of 
the EU, rather than holding one referendum in each member state 
where the smallest country is entitled to block the whole 
development, because otherwise we would be preprogramming our 
own disintegration in the long term. No, we should organize a 
referendum for the total population of the EU. However, that 
will present us with an almost fundamental problem. That, we 
will say, is the result of the negotiations, including the 
contribution made by the EP. Go ahead and say what is on your 
mind. That would be a logical way to proceed. However, I am 
probably daydreaming, saying something like that." 
  Van Miert, who was born in Oud-Turnhout, and for 10 years 
served as chairman of the Flemish Socialist Party, as well as 
being a former member of the Belgian and European Parliaments, 
was appointed commissioner responsible for transport in 1989. 
Last year he inherited the portfolio on competition from Sir 
Leon Brittan. Diplomats in Brussels describe him as a capable 
pragmatist, as someone who does not allow others to walk all 
over him, but who is always prepared to seek solutions and is 
readily approachable. 
<H5>  Reorganization of Steel Sector Within EU Virtually Comatose </H5>
  In recent months, Van Miert was kept busy primarily by the 
crisis in the European steel industry, where tens of thousands 
of jobs are on the line. For 18 months now there has been talk 
within the EU of a voluntary restructuring of the destitute 
steel sector. The industry and the European Commission have 
agreed that money will be made available by Brussels for social 
accompanying measures on condition that the steel companies 
themselves table credible plans for reducing production 
capacity. Moreover, the Commission is helpful in other ways, 
among others by giving the companies price indications and 
"guarding" external European borders against already superficial 
imports. 
  Last December, agreement was reached on reducing the 
production capacity of a number of Spanish, Italian, German, and 
Portuguese companies, which recently received state subsidies. 
The conclusion of that agreement marked the end of the first 
phase of the restructuring operation. Now it is the turn of 
privately owned companies that do not receive state subsidies to 
present their plans for reducing their production capacity. 
However, so far only an insufficient number of companies has 
tabled their plans. In actual fact, the "private sector" 
companies consider that the state-subsidized companies like 
Ilva, CSI, and Eko Stahl, are being made to concede too little. 
  As a result, the entire restructuring operation is being 
threatened with failure. In any case, Van Miert is seriously 
reckoning with such an outcome, and he is not that surprised by 
these developments. In the steel dossier, says Van Miert, the 
power of the individual member states and the impotence of the 
European Commission comes particularly to the fore. He feels 
like a referee who first has to ask for the views of the players 
who have committed an offense before deciding whether to give 
them a warning or send them off: "That does not generate 
results, it is just an endless mess." 
  "How does that work in practice? As a European commissioner, 
you approach, say, the Spanish Government, telling it that it 
must close such-and-such a company, because it is not 
profitable, or that it must reduce its capacity by a certain 
percentage, if it wants us to give our approval in Brussels for 
government support. What does the appropriate minister then 
say? Mr. Van Miert, we cannot agree to this. And we shall meet 
again in the Council of Ministers, because I have the right of 
veto there. So, if you do not go along with what I want, the 
dossier will simply be blocked. In this way, the Spanish 
dossier has been blocked for nearly one year now. In Italy, 
they are simply saying: No government subsidies whatsoever were 
granted here. And why can they get away with that? Because 
they have a damned right of veto." 
  Van Miert has no problem at all doing the rounds in Europe 
doggedly. However, he certainly wants the whole story to be 
told, and to avoid the criticisms going no further than the 
reproach that the Commission extracted too few concessions from 
the Italian, Spanish, German, and Portuguese Governments in the 
negotiations. "I understand this reaction, but then I say: 
Please aim your remarks at those who are responsible for the 
situation, and not at those who have done their very best to 
make as much progress as possible. I have never concealed the 
fact that I would have liked to have made the negotiations (with 
the governments in Italy, Spain, Germany, and Portugal 
respectively -- NRC HANDELSBLAD editor's note) bear much more 
fruit than they did, if only I had been given the opportunities 
to do so. However, unlike the German Government, I simply 
cannot say one day that things are completely insufficient, and 
then block things the next day because of Eko Stahl. Such a 
situation would mean we are just going round in circles." 
  Last week, Van Miert and his colleague Martin Bangemann (the 
commissioner responsible for industry -- NRC HANDELSBLAD 
editor's note) invited representatives of the European 
association of steel companies, Eurofer, to participate in 
informal talks. At these talks, the European commissioners 
issued a clear warning that Brussels will take its hands off the 
restructuring plan if the steel groups fail to come up with 
sufficient reductions in capacity in the near future. "I gained 
the impression that the message was received loud and clear," 
said Bangemann last week. 
  Van Miert also shares that impression. However, that does 
not yet mean any actual headway has been made. "Nothing has 
emerged so far. We will let things run on for another few 
weeks, and then reassess the situation," he said stoically. 
"Naturally, Eurofer also is split into various factions. When 
I talk to Eurofer, I am sitting at the table with Ilva, CSI, and 
Klckner, as well as with Hoogovens and British Steel. So it is 
a really thorny problem. I always say it with a smile on my 
face, but in fact it is dramatically accurate: There are only 
two things on which the steel companies mutually agree: To form 
a cartel under these circumstances, and to take potshots at the 
Commission." 
  The wait-and-see attitude on the part of the steel companies 
is being strengthened further by the relative lack of concern on 
the part of the steel market. "Yes that also plays a role. 
People hope the sun will be shining again during the second 
half of this year or in 1995. Consequently, people are arguing 
in favor of simply riding out the recession. Should it turn out 
reductions in capacity are inescapable, as everyone wants, then 
only reductions by the neighbors should be done. So my analysis 
leads me to believe we will not make much headway." 
  Van Miert foresees two developments. An increasing number of 
companies that have so far managed on their own will now go 
banging on the door of their regional authorities for support. 
The first indications of this are already visible, also in 
other sectors, claims the commissioner. Admittedly, governments 
simply may not provide such support. However, nobody can 
prohibit a government from banging on the door in Brussels in 
order to ask for approval, whereupon the whole procedure starts 
from the beginning again. 
  The other development is that steel companies in Europe 
increasingly will have to work together or merge. Van Miert 
even prefers it this way: "I think it is good if you analyze 
the situation as moving in that direction. After all, the 
current number of steel companies is surely rather excessive." 
However, he imposes clear conditions on this development. "Of 
course, mergers may not be allowed to result in dominant 
positions in certain segments of the market. A line has to be 
drawn to prevent circumstances from arising whereby the market 
no longer plays a role for certain products."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Agreement With European Union"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- After a dogged struggle, Austria 
concluded the negotiations for membership of the European Union 
[EU] late on Tuesday evening [2 March]. A maximum duration of 
nine years with two reviewing conferences was agreed upon with 
regard to the transit treaty. The first reviewing conference 
will be held after three years. 
  The transit treaty will be continued automatically unless 
another decision is reached unanimously. 
  After six years, the EU Commission will present a study on 
whether the ecological objectives of the transit treaty 
(reduction of pollutants by 60 percent) have been achieved. If 
this study concludes the objectives have been reached, the 
transit treaty will expire on 1 January 2001. If the objectives 
of the transit treaty are not reached, the EU Council of 
Ministers can decide on measures that ensure the equivalent 
environmental protection (reduction of pollutants by 60 percent) 
with a qualified majority. Should such a resolution not be 
achieved, the transit treaty will be valid for another three 
years. 
  Immediately after conclusion of the negotiations, 
Agriculture 
Minister Franz Fischler said that the result in the field of 
agriculture is "a result for which one has struggled hard." The 
EU did not make it easy for Austria, and the EU negotiators "did 
not give anything away." The agricultural sector can live with 
the result that has been achieved, Fischler said in a first 
statement. 
  Concerning financing, the EU will provide Austria's 
agriculture with 13 billion schillings in the first year alone. 
  As a result of resistance from the EU, it turned out that 
the 
compensation plan for entry that was offered by Austria "cannot 
be implemented." Therefore, prices will be reduced to the EU 
level on the day of entry and farmers will be compensated by 
decreasing amounts over a period of four years, Fischler 
reported. The EU will contribute 9.2 billion schillings to this 
effort. The gradual opening of the market has been recognized in 
principle by the EU. An expert group will define the technical 
details, he said. 
  Thus, it was also possible to establish the principle of a 
gradual opening of the markets for sensitive products.

<F P=106> [Report by Karin Fischer] </F>
  [Text] Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Haider 
sees his fears confirmed. He has learned there are additional 
agreements to the transit treaty, which, however, are being kept 
secret by the negotiators. It was agreed that, regarding the 
weight limit of 38 tonnes per truck, Austria will adopt the 
guidelines of the European Union [EU]. That is to say, if a 
truck driver from the EU is caught with a heavier load, he will 
be liable to prosecution, but, in contrast to Austrians, he need 
not pay a fine. Haider literally calls this a dirty trick. 
  [Begin Haider recording] One talked of tough negotiations 
while the negotiators themselves were soft at the negotiating 
table. Thus, considering the individual main points of the 
negotiations, one has the feeling that the white flag of 
capitulation had been hoisted before the beginning of the 
struggle at the negotiating table. Klima, Mock, and their 
clique spoke strong words at the beginning of the negotiations. 
Provincial governors had also expressed what was essential -- 
for example, the Tirolean governor's comments on the transit 
treaty, which are actually not at all in line with the results. 
Thus, one can say that the delegation to the negotiations was 
largely hoodwinked in Brussels or it was pulled back when the 
chancellor finally pulled back and did not permit the delegation 
to maintain its tough line, simply because he wanted to achieve 
a result. [end recording] 
  Haider has called on the government to negotiate with the 
FPOe on what can still be done to save the agricultural sector. 
After that, the extraordinary FPOe congress on 8 April will 
decide whether to make a positive or negative recommendation for 
the referendum. 
  The Greens do not share the satisfaction with the outcome of 
the negotiations in the least. Madelaine Petrovic [Greens floor 
leader] asks who can still believe that this government will 
change Europe if it is not even able to adhere to minimum 
conditions, for example, the observance of the transit treaty. 
  [Begin Petrovic recording] The result of the negotiations 
differs widely from the few conditions of the Nationalrat for 
the Austrian Government. The Austrian Government had clear 
instructions regarding neutrality and the maintenance of the 
full duration of the transit treaty. Neither of these things 
has been ensured now. The transit treaty in particular has been 
so flagrantly and crassly violated that I am actually sure that 
this will affect the elections in the laender where diet 
elections will be held in March and that the numerous 
transportation initiatives in Austria will not tolerate it. 
[end recording] 
  This evening, the Greens want to hold first negotiations 
with 
Tirolean transit opponents on possible blockades. 
  In contrast to the other two opposition parties, Heide 
Schmidt from the Liberal Forum regards the transit solution as 
an acceptable compromise. 
  [Begin Schmidt recording] I am satisfied with the fact that 
we have opened the road to an important objective for Austria, 
that is, to become an EU member. It is absolutely possible that 
more might have been achieved on one point or another. However, 
in my opinion, as a member of the opposition, one also has the 
duty to see the objective and not to dish out petty political 
blows. [end recording] 
  Heide Schmidt clearly recommends a yes vote in the 
referendum.

  [Excerpt] Vienna -- After the agreement in Brussels, the 
Austrians seem to have been seized with euphoria for Europe: A 
poll that was exclusively carried out by the OGM [Austrian

  This is the result of a flash poll that was carried out by 
the OGM on Wednesday evening (500 telephone contacts that are

these results, 42 percent of the population would vote for 
Austria's entry into the EU in the June referendum, 25 percent 
against, and 32 percent undecided. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Profit and Loss"] </F>
  [Text] The political situation in the Netherlands has been 
given a thorough shaking, although voters produced a smaller 
earthquake than expected. The differences between the big 
parties have diminished considerably, but the ranking has not 
changed. Therefore, in the midst of all the distress about the 
predicted losses, the PvdA [Labor Party] in particular can 
breathe again while the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] is 
experiencing the most difficult period of its existence. 
  The outcome of the municipal elections are reason enough for 
the VVD [People's Party For Freedom and Democracy] and D66 
[Democratic 66] to be satisfied, but not elated. They did win, 
but they attracted only half of the votes lost by the government 
parties. In particular D66's growth was smaller than what had 
been predicted in recent years. Therefore, the Democratic power 
base in the cities is narrower than what looked likely before 
the elections. 
  The results are only of limited importance for the 
parliamentary elections of 3 May, but the present coalition 
looks certain to lose its majority. A third party will soon be 
necessary to be able to form a cabinet. Therefore, in the 
coming months the struggle will be dominated by the question of 
which party will finish second after the CDA. 
  A section of the electorate is showing an increasing 
aversion 
to the minor differences between the main tendencies in 
Netherlands politics. This can explain the strong growth of 
GreenLeft, and the Socialist Party is also benefitting from this 
factor. It is regrettable that the extreme right is tapping 
into all forms of dissatisfaction, but the new councils will be 
able to combat them.

<F P=106> [George Jones report: "Services in Conflict With Cabinet"] </F>
  [Text] A serious clash is looming between the Cabinet and 
defence chiefs over the Government's refusal to send more troops 
to Bosnia. Service chiefs say the 2,300 troops there are so 
thinly spread that they could be dangerously exposed if the war 
worsens. The Chiefs of Staff have yet to make an unconditional 
formal recommendation to the Government to send reinforcements, 
but their concern is growing. 
  Senior soldiers have decided to give urgent support to a 
request from Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, the British UN Commander, 
for another battalion of infantry. 
  Gen Rose is understood to have told the Chiefs of Staff that 
the ceasefire he has brokered around Sarajevo -- and is 
extending to other areas -- could crumble without more troops to 
enforce it. 
  There is also a growing concern in the Army that the 
Government, which argues that extra troops should come from 
other countries, is failing to back a senior British officer who 
is widely acknowledged to have transformed the situation around 
Sarajevo with his tougher attitude to the warring factions. 
  Authoritative sources confirmed last night that there were 
now serious differences between Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the Defence 
Secretary, and military chiefs, who want an additional battalion 
to be sent to Bosnia for three months. 
  Ministers hit back, saying that the previous advice from the 
military on reinforcing the British contingent has been 
"ambivalent." A senior source in the Ministry of Defence also 
stated that the Chiefs of Staff had so far made only one formal 
recommendation to the Government: that the sending of additional 
troops should be conditional on other nations agreeing to put in 
extra men. The Cabinet's committee on Defence and Overseas 
Policy (OPD) has firmly backed Mr Rifkind's opposition to 
sending another battalion until other Nato countries, 
particularly the United States, make a contribution. 
  After weeks of arguing the case behind doors in Whitehall, 
senior officers now want the issue made public. The opening 
shot in a remarkable trial of strength between the armed forces 
and the Government was a letter to The Daily Telegraph on 
Tuesday from Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff, 
who still has close links with the Army. 
  He said it seemed incredible that the Government had 
"largely 
spurned" a request by such a senior general. 
  "You could hardly imagine the French or even the American 
Government taking such a negative view if one of their own 
generals had achieved so much." The Government's opposition to 
sending more troops was reaffirmed by Mr Douglas Hurd, the 
Foreign Secretary. In an article in yesterday's London EVENING 
STANDARD, headed "Why we won't be dragged into the quagmire," he 
acknowledged that the UN might need extra men, but said that 
Britain, with France, Spain, Holland, Canada and Malaysia, were 
doing their bit. 
  "The extra should come from elsewhere," he said. 
  However, it was disclosed last night that the French, who 
have the largest contingent in Bosnia, have decided to send out 
a replacement battalion. It will overlap with the existing 
forces there, and provide valuable additional support for the UN 
peace keeping force under Gen Rose's command. 
  Senior ministers confirmed there was still strong opposition 
in the OPD Cabinet committee to sending more troops. So far, 
all that has been agreed is the despatch of 60 men with mortar 
locating equipment and permission for Gen Rose to redeploy some 
Coldstream Guards already stationed in Bosnia. 
  Although Mr Major, who chairs the committee, is sympathetic 
to Gen Rose, some of the Cabinet's most heavyweight figures are 
opposed to any deeper involvement. They are backed by most Tory 
MPs, who fear that Britain could be sucked into a 
"Vietnam-style" conflict. 
  On the one side are Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Harding, 
Chief of the Defence Staff, Gen Sir Peter Inge, Air Chief 
Marshal Sir Michael Graydon and Adml Sir Benjamin Bathurst. 
  Lined up against them are Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, 
Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Mr 
Rifkind and Mr Hurd. The Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, 
also attends OPD meetings, largely to give advice on 
international law. 
  Mr Clarke -- the second most powerful member of the 
Government -- is the strongest opponent of sending more troops. 
Mr Rifkind, who pointed out last week that there were only 15 
US personnel on the ground in Bosnia, has also formed a close 
alliance with Mr Hurd in arguing that other countries should 
make a contribution before Britain does more. 
  The Prime Minister is said by colleagues to be acutely 
aware of the danger that the Government could be accused of 
failing to back a British general at a crucial moment in the 
Balkan crisis. 
  Mr Major was in the forefront of pushing for British backing 
for a more "muscular response" by NATO in the wake of the 
Sarajevo market place massacre. In talks with President Clinton 
in Washington on Monday [28 February] Mr Major urged him to 
reflect urgently on the UN's need for more troops to enforce the 
ceasefires now being established in Bosnia. 
  But the President again reaffirmed that America would not 
contemplate sending ground troops until there was an overall 
peace settlement. Mr Major suggested that a contingent of 
Italian troops could be sent to Bosnia when he later met the 
United Nations Secretary General, Mr Butrus Butrus Ghali, in New 
York. This is now under active consideration . 
  At Westminster there is growing concern over the rift 
between 
the Cabinet and the military chiefs. It is the most serious 
dispute on operational matters that has developed between this 
Government and the Army. 
  There is now evident worry at the highest levels over the 
dangers faced by the British contingent in Bosnia. 
  The soldiers are said to be tired and spread out in small 
groups, without the ability to defend themselves against an 
all-out attack. 
  Gen Rose will have an opportunity to state his case for more 
troops when a deputation from the cross-party Commons defence 
select committee visits the British peacekeeping forces in 
former Yugoslavia early next week. The general will travel to 
Split on the Croatian coast to meet them. 
  Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and 
chairman of the select committee, said last night that he backed 
the Cabinet's view that other countries should be expected to 
play their part first. 
  "If more troops are sent we want to be sure we can extricate 
ourselves. Otherwise we could find ourselves going down the 
Vietnam road." 
  But Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, 
who will be part of the select committee deputation, said: "When 
a British general performing a very difficult United Nations 
command actually asks for more troops, his Government has a 
pretty specific obligation towards him. 
  ``I don't think that ministers should let people take these 
commands unless they are willing to give them the necessary 
support.''

  [Text] Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind today warned the 
Serbs against any retaliatory action following the shooting down 
of four of their attack aircraft. 
  Mr Rifkind said the action against the aircraft was sad but 
the UN Security Council had given a clear warning that any use 
of fixed wing aircraft for aggressive purposes would result in 
that action. 
  Asked if he was concerned at any Serbian response, he 
replied: "One has always been conscious of the fact that people 
might be tempted to make any retaliatory incidents. 
  ``I think they should take into account that the United 
Nations forces in general, and the British forces in particular, 
have the means and military assets to defend themselves and 
would have the full support of the British Government and the UN 
as a whole if they needed to use them.'' 
  Mr Rifkind was visiting the Royal Navy's weapons engineering 
shore training establishment, HMS Collingwood, at Fareham, 
Hampshire. Earlier, at the Portsmouth naval base, he met 
Admiral Sir John Kerr, Commander in Chief Naval Home Command, 
and other senior officers.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Government today admitted there was a 
three-month-long "incorrect entanglement" between arms sales and 
aid to Malaysia in 1988. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said 
aid to Malaysia and 1 billion pounds in defence sales were 
linked between March and June 1988 under a protocol signed by 
the then Defence Secretary George Younger. 
  Mr Hurd told the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee: 
"There was a temporary, incorrect entanglement, but there is now 
no link." 
  And the Government accused Malaysia of being "short-sighted" 
in imposing its trade ban last week in response to British press 
allegations surrounding the Pergau dam project and arms sales to 
the former colony. 
  Labour later claimed Mr Hurd's evidence, during a grilling 
by 
MPs which lasted almost three hours, was "incredible" and that 
the link between aid and arms sales must have continued after 
June 1988. 
  Britain contributed 234 million pounds to the dam 
construction, believed to be the largest amount of overseas aid 
for a single project in British history, while the Ministry of 
Defence discussed a 1 billion pound defence with Malaysia [as 
received]. 
  Premier Mahathir Mohamad, angered by reports on the affair 
in 
Britain which included corruption accusations, has banned UK 
firms from applying for contracts for Malaysian Government 
business in a return to its Buy British Last policy. [passage 
omitted] 
  Earlier, John Major accused the Malaysian Government of 
being 
"short-sighted" for freezing out British firms. In a radio 
interview, the Prime Minister said Malaysia owed much of its 
economic development to British trade and investment and its 
interests would be equally badly affected. 
  He told BBC Radio 4's "Today" programme: "I don't believe 
that what the Malaysian Government has done to British companies 
is remotely justified." Malaysia was "within striking distance" 
of achieving its ambition to become an industrialised country. 
He added: "I believe it is short-sighted to have acted as they 
have done, and I believe that over time they may be seen to have 
damaged the Malaysian interest as much as the British." 
  Foreign Office Minister Alastair Goodlad drummed home the 
message later in a speech to businessmen from the Asia-Pacific 
advisory group in which he warned that Malaysia had missed its 
target and was hurting "its friends." Mr Goodlad said British 
exports to Malaysia were worth almost 1 billion pounds last year 
alone but added: "Trade benefits both partners. It should be 
encouraged, not blocked." [passage omitted] 
  In his appearance before the committee, Mr Hurd criticised 
the "swirl of speculative allegations" about the dam project, 
adding: "To the best of my knowledge, most of these stories are 
creatures of fancy." He said Britain was keen to increase trade 
with Malaysia in 1988 and the Ministry of Defence had been 
negotiating a 1 billion pound defence deal. 
  A protocol signed by Mr Younger, now Lord Younger, 
"reflected 
the Malaysian wish" for British aid equivalent to 20 percent of 
the defence deal, Mr Hurd said. The link was broken three 
months later when the Ministry of Defence realised it was 
incorrect. 
  The Malaysians were informed in a letter from Mr Younger but 
the committee heard that Malaysia was given a commitment for 200 
million pounds in British aid in a different letter on the same 
day. 
  Labour's Dennis Canavan asked Mr Hurd how he thought the 
Malaysians would have viewed this. "Would you not even have the 
tiniest bit of suspicion there was a link between these two 
messages, or would you just think it was Christmas?" he asked. 
  Mr Hurd stressed the Government had "learned from the Pergau 
experience" and procedures were tightened. But shadow foreign 
secretary Jack Cunningham dismissed his evidence as "inadequate, 
contradictory and incredible." 
  He said: "There can only be one explanation for the fact 
that 
the Prime Minister John Major and the Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd ignored the clear advice of their accounting officer that 
the dam project was `an abuse of the aid system.' That is that 
the two projects continued to be linked, despite the denial by 
Conservative ministers to the House of Commons, the Public 
Accounts Committee and now the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. 
  ``The fact that British trade and British jobs are now at 
risk is entirely the fault of the Conservative Government and 
Conservative ministers and their disreputable deals.''

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor, in </F>
New York] 
  [Text] Britain has altered beyond recognition over the past 
15 years and is changing still, the Prime Minister said today. 
  John Major told 1,000 businessmen in New York: "What we are 
working for is nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for 
the 21st century." 
  He used a key speech to the British-American Chamber of 
Commerce to stress that the UK was emerging from recession 
faster and more strongly than any other leading country in 
Europe. 
  During the address, the culmination of Mr. Major's three-day 
trip to the US, he also: 

  -  Pledged to go ahead with the 
"three strand" talks on Northern Ireland, despite the rebuff he 
has suffered from the Ulster Unionists; 
  -  Announced he hoped the 
GATT world trade deal could be implemented on January 1, 1995 -- 
six months ahead of the original plan. 
  Mr. Major said: "Britain has changed out of all recognition 
in the past 15 years and is changing again in the 1990s." 
  He told his audience: "Like you, we have just come through a 
recession. It was painful, but we have come out stronger than 
before. 
  ``This past year, Britain's economy has been growing twice 
as 
fast as forecast. And this coming year we are again expecting 
the fastest growth rate among main European countries.'' 
  However, Mr. Major stressed that more change was needed for 
Britain to sharpen its competitive edge. 
  "That is why we are embarked on a fundamental review of all 
the factors affecting our ability to succeed in the global 
marketplace. Competitiveness is the key challenge for the 1990s 
-- and it is one the British welcome." 
  The Prime Minister pledged: "What we are working for is 
nothing less than the reskilling of Britain for the 21st 
century." 
  He said added that it was not just industry that must 
innovate, but government as well. 
  "The days of monolithic government are over. The governments 
that will help their countries to be competitive will do less 
but do it better. All our government departments have been told 
to roll back the burden of regulation. 
  ``There is one British produce I want to see less of -- our 
famous red tape.'' 
  Mr. Major said Britain and America were now driving through 
the historic GATT trade deal. 
  He and President Clinton had agreed they should set an early 
target for tariff cuts to be implemented -- January 1, 1995 -- 
but other countries had to be consulted before this could become 
a reality. 
  Mr. Major also stressed that Britain was the ideal base for 
operations in Europe, saying: "It is no accident that nearly 40 
percent of all U.S. investment in Europe comes to Britain. We 
intend to keep it that way." 
  He claimed that much of Europe was over-regulated, something 
which cost jobs and added to the burdens carried by employers. 
  On Bosnia, the Prime Minister said he and President Clinton 
had agreed that Britain and the U.S. would take joint action to 
build on the Sarajevo ceasefire. 
  "We are sending a joint British-American planning mission to 
see how we can help restore public utilities there." 
  He said they both believed in firm action to enforce the 
no-fly zone and that Britain was supporting the American-led 
diplomatic initiative to seek agreement between Bosnia's Croats 
and Muslims. 
  On Northern Ireland, the Prime Minister spoke of the 
overwhelming support the Downing Street Declaration had 
received, highlighting the BBC poll showing over 90 percent of 
people throughout the island of Ireland wanted Sinn Fein to 
renounce violence. 
  "Yet they continue to hold back from the peace process and 
perpetuate violence. There have been 17 attacks on the security 
forces since the declaration." 
  The Prime Minister said he hoped Sinn Fein could yet be 
persuaded to change. 
  "I believe that strong support for peace coming from America 
can play a part in this. In the meantime, the British and Irish 
Governments will continue to work with the constitutional 
parties for a lasting political settlement."

<F P=106> [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Four senior Russian military experts today arrived 
in Scotland for a snap inspection of the Royal Navy's biggest 
amphibious exercise for seven years. 
  The Russians -- three colonels and a naval captain -- gave 
Britain 48 hours notice of their intention to carry out an 
on-the- spot investigation of the exercise, taking place in the 
Western Isles. 
  Although the connection is officially denied, the exercise 
covers the type of training that would be required if British 
troops had to be evacuated from war-torn Bosnia. It includes 
1,500 Royal Marines supported by five frigates, a submarine, 
assault and landing ships and five minehunters, who have been 
making beach landings near Stornoway. 
  For the first time in Britain, the marines have been joined 
by French and Dutch commandos. Both those countries have forces 
in the former Yugoslavia and France is the biggest contributor 
of troops there. 
  An army spokesman in Edinburgh said the Russian inspection 
request was in line with a 34-nation treaty signed in Paris in 
1990. Under the treaty, big exercises are notified in advance, 
and nations have the right to carry out inspections to "clarify 
any doubts about compliance with the agreed measures." 
  The spokesman said the exercise, "Royal Dawn," was 
unconnected with the Bosnian situation, and was the annual 
winter exercise for the 3d Commando Brigade.

<F P=106> [Article by Antti Penttinen: "Additional Funds Helpful: </F>
Garrisons Not To Close After All"] 
  [Text] Preparations to close garrison after garrison for 
financial reasons have been halted. According to Admiral Jan 
Klenberg, commander in chief of the Armed Forces, such plans 
were canceled when the Eduskunta appropriated another 207 
million markkas for defense for the current year. The military 
received funds as a result of the collective bargaining 
agreement approved by the state. 
  "According to the collective bargaining agreement, the Armed 
Forces will not be required to initiate new staff cutbacks or 
mandatory furloughs during the 1994-95 period," noted Adm. 
Klenberg in a speech during the opening ceremonies of the 
National Defense Course last Monday [11 January] in Helsinki. 
  "By implementing the other significant savings measures that 
we have planned, we should be able to get through this year in 
some manner," opined Klenberg. 
  He emphasized that the military operating expenditures for 
next year should, according to the Eduskunta, be brought to "a 
level consistent with our defense readiness." 
  Last September, Klenberg presented the preliminary plans for 
the closing of garrisons. 
  All garrisons were supposed to close for a month, and, at 
the 
same time, conscripts and permanent employees were to take 
mandatory furloughs. 
  In his opening speech, Adm. Klenberg also talked about the 
domestic defense industry. He expressed concern about its 
continued viability. 
  In Klenberg's view, cuts in defense spending will lead, 
during the next years, to the military being unable to order 
munitions from the domestic defense industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Riitta-Eliisa Laine: "Minor Impact From EEA </F>
Agreement on Social Welfare"] 
  [Text] Many must learn to fill out EEA [European Economic 
Area] forms. 
  The Finns, who have become accustomed to the benefits of the 
welfare state, need not fear the dawn of the EEA era, as the EEA 
agreement will only have a minor effect on Finnish social 
benefits. However, many Finns must learn to fill out the EEA 
forms. 
  From a practical standpoint, the agreement affects mainly 
those who travel abroad to find employment or who come to 
Finland from abroad to work. While traveling in another EEA 
country, a Finnish tourist may utilize the agreement, for 
instance, if he becomes ill, as long as the person can present 
the necessary documents. A retiree will always receive medical 
care according to the laws of his country, no matter in which 
EEA country he resides. 
  If a person resides and works only in Finland, the social 
benefits will remain the same as before the effective date of 
the EEA agreement. 
  One of the most important cornerstones of the EEA agreement 
is the concept of equal treatment of all EEA citizens. While 
residing in an EEA country, a citizen of another member nation 
may enjoy the same social benefits as the citizens of the host 
nation. Refugees and stateless people who reside in EEA 
countries are also entitled to the same social benefits as the 
citizens of the countries in question. 
<H5>  Pensions Based on Residency </H5>
  Pension benefits, however, are determined based on the laws 
of each country, as well as the terms governing such pension 
benefits. In other words, the agreement does not make the 
pension benefits uniform in the various EEA countries. On the 
other hand, it becomes easier to secure pension rights in 
another country in such a way that missing years can be 
supplemented by years worked in another country. When an EEA 
worker retires in Finland, the worker is entitled to collect 
pensions from all EEA countries where he has resided or worked. 
  Each country also defines, based on its own regulations, 
when 
a person is classified as disabled. 
  Simultaneously with the EEA agreement, changes in the 
National Basic Pension Act and the National Survivor's Pension 
Act came into effect in Finland. According to the new 
legislation, the amount of basic pension and survivor's pension 
received depends on the time a person has resided in Finland. 
<H5>  EEA Norms for Medical Professions </H5>
  In the field of health care, the EEA agreement requires that 
the regulations pertaining to the practices of physicians and 
dentists be adapted to the regulations of the EEA. The same 
applies to the professions of head pharmacist, pharmacist, 
optician, dental technician, registered nurse, and midwife. 
  Based on an application, the National Board of Medicolegal 
Affairs may grant a citizen of another EEA nation the right to 
practice these professions. 
  The EEA also affects the National Health Insurance Act. The 
goal is to supervise reimbursement of prescription drugs and to 
increase competition in the medical drug markets. The 
regulations regarding products classified as medical drugs are 
changing. All products, the purpose of which is to cure, 
palliate, or prevent illness, are considered medical drugs and 
are subject to the applicable rules and regulations. No longer 
is it permissible to ascribe medical use to products that 
cannot, as such, be considered medical drugs. 
<H5>  General Information Pamphlet </H5>
  The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the National 
Pension Institute, and the Central Pension Security Institute 
have jointly prepared a pamphlet "A Brief Guide to EEA and 
Finnish Social Benefits," which provides general information 
about the new system. The free pamphlet is available from local 
offices of the National Pension Institute, from the Central 
Pension Security Institute's mail order department, telephone 
90-1511, and from the National Pension Institute's mailing 
office, telephone 90-434 11. At a later date, the pamphlet will 
also become available in Swedish and English.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Changes Will Refresh Government"] </F>
  [Text] A good opportunity is opening up for Esko Aho's 
nonsocialist government to obtain fresh blood for the government 
when the Eduskunta elects a new speaker next Monday [8 
February], and when Martti Pura, the minister of agriculture, 
departs soon to become the city manager of Sodankyla. Let us 
hope that the government makes skillful use of both 
opportunities. The government is tired and in a rut. It needs 
competent new ministers to manage during the year remaining 
before the Eduskunta elections. 
  The Conservatives have wanted to change ministers for a long 
time, but the undertaking did not succeed in practice. The 
speaker's post will be vacated by Ilkka Suominen, who is moving 
to Alko [alcoholic beverage monopoly] in the nick of time. If 
the Conservatives name one of their ministers as the new speaker 
-- for example Riitta Uosukainen -- space will naturally be 
created in the government. During the government's term, four 
Center Party ministers have already been changed, but the 
Conservatives continue with their original makeup. Experience 
has not helped the Conservatives win victories in the 
government; it is high time to see if a personnel change will 
bring new vigor to their government group. 
  It would pay the Conservatives, however, to consider 
carefully whom they change and to what post. It would be useless 
-- although there are attempts -- to move Ilkka Kanerva from the 
Labor Ministry a year before the Eduskunta election. The shift 
would look like desertion. One would wish that the Center Party, 
for its part, would realize that, on the threshold of important 
EU [European Union] negotiations affecting agriculture, it is 
time to implement a fundamental change in the intellectual and 
skill qualifications at the Ministry of Agriculture. The 
leadership of the ministry can only be assumed by someone who 
knows foreign languages and can operate smoothly in the world.

<F P=106> [Bard Idas report: "Godal Hopes for Respect for United </F>
Nations"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Godal hopes that the downing of 
the Serbian aircraft will lead to all sides respecting UN 
resolutions hereafter. 
  "The downing of the four Serbian aircraft happened after a 
clear breach of the no-fly zone over Bosnia set up by the United 
Nations. All the sides know the consequences of breaking this 
no-fly ban. The aircraft refused to comply with warnings from 
the U.S. NATO aircraft before they were shot down," a statement 
from Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said. 
  The foreign minister pointed out that there have been a 
growing number of violations of the flight ban over Bosnia. The 
action was carried out on the basis of a resolution by the UN 
Security Council on 31 March 1993, and NATO was asked to 
implement the resolution on behalf of the United Nations. 
  "It is important that the ban on flights be upheld, if UN 
resolutions are to be credible," Godal said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F>
correspondent Stefano Tomassini on 2 March; place not given] 
  [Text] [Tomassini] Minister, these have been long and 
difficult negotiations, and talks with Norway, for example, are 
still not over. Why has it been so difficult? 
  [Andreatta] These have been the first negotiations toward 
widening the European Union [EU] since Maastricht, and a group 
of countries, including Italy, wants to set very strict 
conditions -- that is to say, immediately bringing even new 
member countries in at the stage where Europe has no borders. 
  [Tomassini] Turning to Austria, how and in what way is the 
entry of this country into the EU important for Italy? 
  [Andreatta] For Italy it means truly implementing 
Maastricht. 
In effect, we only had free borders with France. A large part 
of our borders were still subject to the delays of frontier 
controls. Above all, politically speaking, Austria's membership, 
which we have strongly advocated, represents the opening of 
possibilities in a new and imminent cycle in which countries 
from central and eastern Europe join the Union. 
  [Tomassini] Some people will certainly be thinking that an 
enlarged Europe is tantamount to a watered down Europe. Is 
there a real risk that some of the original spirit of the 
community will be lost? 
  [Andreatta] Of course. Any institution which grows is 
subject to tensions, but it is also enriched. The culture of 
northern democracies will be a very important component in the 
future Europe. But I believe that this risk must be faced, 
because events which have happened since 1989 mean that if 
Europe wants a political role it must bring order to the process 
of developing democracies in the former socialist countries. 
This entails enlargement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Second Republic: New Parliament </F>
Includes 456 New Faces Out of 945"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Four weeks from the election, an initial 
balance can be drawn of the Italian "revolution" which, fueled 
by Bribe City, destroyed the old political establishment. 
However, who will be the main players in the new system? There 
will be at least 456 newcomers in the next legislature. Yet, 
almost one out every two outgoing deputies has decided to 
reattempt making his way into Palazzo Madama [Senate] or 
Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies]. In fact, 489 out of 945 
(51.7 percent) are running in the elections. Results will not 
be known until 29 March, but a list of those who will be absent 
can already be drawn up now. 
  From the data collected on the lists, a comparison can be 
made between those elected in 1992 and today's candidates. The 
result is a turnover index somewhat below 50 percent, and a sort 
of "new face" list: This is headed -- willy-nilly and by dint 
of events -- by the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] and the PPI 
[Italian Popular Party], followed by the PDS [Democratic Party 
of the Left], half of whose candidates are newcomers. At the 
bottom of the list are the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the 
League. On average, 95 to 96 percent of their outgoing deputies 
have been confirmed as candidates. There will be, then, 456 
missing faces in the new legislature. Those who will stay at 
home are largely former deputies of the old four-party majority: 
193 former DC [Christian Democratic Party] members out of 313, 
100 PSI members out of 140, 12 PSDI [Italian Social Democratic 
Party] members out of 19, and nine Liberals out of 22. Overall, 
out of the 494 outgoing Chamber and Senate members belonging to 
the DC, PSI, PSDI, and PLI, 314 have already been excluded from 
the palace: 63.6 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Chamber of Deputies floor </F>
leader Roberto Maroni by Gianni Pennacchi in Rome; date not 
given: "`OK, I Am Running for Prime Minister'"] 
  [Text] He fires no fusillades, preferring the soft chords 
of the electronic keyboard to deafening bursts of fire, but the 
music is still the same: He and Bossi are reading from the same 
score, and you would have considerable difficulty in finding 
dissonances. Malicious tongues insinuate that, in reality, the 
floor leader is merely slick at adapting to circumstances, 
always acknowledging the supremacy of the leader, but actually 
each has his own part to play: One strikes and the other 
soothes. One thing is certain, however: Roberto Maroni can 
soften even the League's harshest messages. 
  Thus, while he provides musical interludes, at the keyboard, 
of course, during the election rallies, Bossi's candidate for 
prime minister confirms his bid: Palazzo Chigi, the bone of 
contention between the League and Forza Italia, will go to 
whoever obtains the most votes, implicitly, therefore, to 
Maroni. Martinazzoli? Nothing doing, there will be no governing 
with "the old"; and Spadolini can forget it too, he and his 
"institutional" governments. Fini? Sorry, he is still beyond 
the Leaguist pale; at the most he could give outside backing to 
a minority "freedom alignment" government. But then, why should 
the competition between Bossi and Berlusconi come as such a 
surprise? Mao would call it "contradictions among the people," 
there is perfect unison on the manifesto, nothing like the 
cacophony to be heard from the Left. 
  [Pennacchi] What are you up to, Maroni? While Bossi totes 
his musket about, you play the piano? 
  [Maroni] It is just two different ways of giving our 
opponents an earful. He fires fusillades, and I use the 
keyboard. 
  [Pennacchi] It is official then, you are the League's 
candidate for prime minister, designated to Palazzo Chigi by 
Bossi? 
  [Maroni] OK, let us say so. But I am not losing sleep over 
it, in fact it has put me in a good mood. 
  [Pennacchi] Does it not create problems for you with 
Berlusconi? You yourself acted as the League's ambassador to 
Forza Italia. 
  [Maroni] And why should it create problems for me? At the 
end of the day, what it will all boil down to is who wins the 
election. Everyone can pick the candidate they want, but we 
cannot say now what will emerge from the vote. So proposing a 
name for prime minister just means flying a flag until the 
accounts are balanced after 29 March. 
  [Pennacchi] So what is all this about the war of the prime 
ministers, this affirmation of Leaguist pride? 
  [Maroni] Whatever Giorgio Bocca [journalist] may say, the 
League has people equal to any ministerial appointment. So if 
the prime minister's job is to head a government team, we have 
proved that we have more than one person capable of doing it. 
  [Pennacchi] Nevertheless, a handicap from which the 
progressive alignment suffers now seems to be afflicting the 
freedom alignment as well: You, too, are not so united, with 
Bossi hurling daggers at Berlusconi, firing point-blank on Fini. 
  [Maroni] Fini does not form part of the freedom alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] True, but he is one of the opponents of the 
Left. 
  [Maroni] Martinazzoli opposes the Left too, but he is an 
opponent of ours as well. The freedom alignment does not 
currently comprise the National Alliance. Nor does Fini seem to 
me to be using kid gloves against us; the fact that he is 
running against us in all the constituencies in the north shows 
that he is outside the freedom alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] And why is Bossi taking potshots at Berlusconi? 
  [Maroni] Bossi is stressing something that is a fact: In 
this freedom alignment, there is one political body, the League, 
that has made a decisive contribution to the defeat of the old 
system, and there is another component, Forza Italia, that 
emerged a month ago. This is the difference underlying the 
League's claim to the political leadership of the alignment. 
  [Pennacchi] Which nevertheless generates conflict, like on 
the Left. 
  [Maroni] There is conflict, but it does not concern the 
manifesto and matters of substance like it does on the Left, 
with Bertinotti saying treasury bonds should be taxed and 
Occhetto saying they should not, Bertinotti advocating 
withdrawal from NATO and Occhetto going off to meet its 
secretary-general. This means they have no joint program, 
whereas we have, a federalist, liberal program. Our 
disagreements do not touch on the things to be done. There are 
four of us in the alignment, and we are running separately in 
the proportional vote, because there are a few differences, but 
they are not programmatic, nor are they as deep-rooted as they 
are on the Left. 
  [Pennacchi] To put it simply, what do you quarrel over? 
  [Maroni] We quarrel over who is the 100-percent expression 
of 
what is new, and who expresses the new tendencies, though 
without being completely new, as is the case with Forza Italia. 
  [Pennacchi] By the way, has the Leaguist people's rebellion 
against the candidates imposed from above and regarded with 
disfavor been quelled? 
  [Maroni] It was not a rebellion, just a strong protest by 
those who found they had to accept not so much the Forza Italia 
candidates, but some from the CCD [Democratic Christian Center], 
in other words former Christian Democrats. I understand and 
appreciate their reaction, but it is the price we have to pay 
for the political deal. And I'm telling League militants that 
this operation will allow the League to win the election and 
enter the government. We must look beyond the boundaries of our 
own constituencies and swallow the bitter pill. 
  [Pennacchi] To hear Bossi speak, the impression is that you 
are more willing to govern with Martinazzoli than with Fini. 
  [Maroni] No, Martinazzoli never. He represents the old. 
Fini represents the extremely old, although the fact that he 
has never governed militates in his favor. But one thing is 
clear: We have chosen our allies first, and there is no chance 
of a deal with the others; they are all our opponents. 
  [Pennacchi] And what if you win the election but cannot 
achieve an absolute majority without Fini? 
  [Maroni] Our experience over the last year leads me to 
believe that even a minority government that seeks a separate 
majority to vote each individual measure is possible. And if it 
were not possible, we would certainly not do deals with the DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] or the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left]. 
  [Pennacchi] So you say no to Spadolini's proposals? 
  [Maroni] In the face of the unstoppable advance of the new, 
Spadolini and all the other old blusterers from the old regime 
should have the humility to keep their mouths shut. If we had 
to take lessons from Spadolini and Scalfaro, the trainbearers to 
all the Christian Democrat governments, in how the new Italy 
should be governed, we should have no chance. The electorate 
will tell us what we have to do on 27 and 28 March. Spadolini 
should just thank his lucky stars that he is a senator for life.

<F P=106> [Report by Franco Coppola: "Appeal Court's Final Verdicts"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- The die really is now cast. The picture is 
now complete, apart from three or four appeals to the regional 
administrative courts, perhaps announced simply because of a 
reluctance to admit being in the wrong. At 1400 hours [1300 
GMT] yesterday the Appeal Court's central electoral office, in a 
marathon five-day session, completed its examination of 204 
appeals submitted by candidates excluded from the election, 
primarily on basis of irregularities in the gathering of 
signatures for the electoral lists. The 20 magistrates -- 
chosen by the first chairman of the Supreme Court in view of 
their impartiality and the fact that they live in Rome -- 
returned to their regular jobs, leaving the clerk of the court's 
office working intensively until the evening faxing the 
magistrates' decisions to the various constituency offices that 
forwarded appeals to Rome. 
  The final decisions entail Rete's exclusion from Campania 2 
(Benevento, Avellino, Caserta, and Salerno) for the proportional 
vote and the reinstatement for the proportional vote in Calabria 
of the National Alliance lists (headed by Raffaele Valensise) 
and the Communist Renewal lists (headed by Fausto Bertinotti). 
But the Renewal [Rinnovamento], Pannella, and southern Italy 
lists were not successful. With regard to some of the smaller 
lists, the Veritas Movement and Fascism and Freedom were 
approved , while the Southern Movement and European Liberal 
Democrats were turned down. Last, the Popular Party's outgoing 
deputy for the single-candidate constituency of Catanzaro was 
reinstated. 
  The Southern Action League -- a political grouping headed by 
Mayor of Taranto Giancarlo Cito -- will also be able to compete 
for the proportional vote. The same decision was reached in 
connection with Tommaso Mitrotti, former Italian Social Movement 
[MSI] senator and founder of Social Democracy, which is linked 
to Cito's movement, and Prince Sforza Ruspoli, linked with the 
mayor with the South Wind-Viva Zapata list. The Appeal Court 
turned down Novella Calligaris, a Chamber of Deputies candidate 
for Rome's constituency 6 on the Pact for Italy list. The same 
goes for Gianfranco Zambelli, on the same list in constituency 
5, and Vincenzo Logasso of the Justicialist Party in 
constituency 12. As for Milan, all the appeals by Chamber 
candidates were turned down. Thus the exclusions affecting Uber 
Ravagnani (Italian Citizens' Union), Antonio Ziveri (Pact), and 
Eugenio Girolo (New Ecological Democratic Italy and Environment) 
still stand. 
  Of the major parties, Forza Italia will be excluded from 
Umbria for the Senate and in Puglia for the proportional vote; 
the League in Rome and its province for the Senate and in the 
Marches; the Pact in Piedmont for the proportional vote and one 
of its candidates in Milan and two in Rome for the Chamber; the 
Democratic Alliance in Trentino for the proportional vote; the 
progressive alignment loses one Chamber candidate, again in 
Trentino, and is excluded from the Senate elections in Nuoro 
(Ayala's status as candidate for Catania is also in doubt); 
Communist Renewal in Sicily; Rete in Campania and Veneto; the 
Pannella list in two constituencies in Veneto for the 
proportional vote and in the Marches, where it was standing 
together with the Reformers; Renewal [Rinnovamento] in the 
Marches, Umbria (the Senate), and Puglia (lower house). 
  Various kinds of appeal were announced the other day by the 
League over the expulsion of its candidates in the Marches and 
yesterday by Forza Italia in connection with its five lost 
candidates in Umbria; by Sgarbi's former spokesman, Franco 
Corbelli (Calabria); and by the Pannella list, which will appeal 
"in every civil, political, and judicial forum" over its 
exclusion from the two Veneto constituencies. Massimo Natale -- 
a Naples candidate not connected with any of the lists -- 
constitutes a separate case. The Appeal Court reinstated him, 
but completing the list of symbols is proving a problem in 
Naples because Massimo Natale does not have one. This means 
that, at least in theory, an insoluble dispute could arise. 
Parliament would have to have the final say on the matter. 
  Last, some observations about the principles pursued by the 
Appeal Court's central electoral office. Appeals were allowed 
in the case of such venial sins as small excesses in the number 
of signatures, the use of non-regulation forms, the lack of 
adequate documentation -- that is, all the cases in which the 
errors did not undermine the relationship of trust between 
voters and candidate. The other cases were rejected -- shortage 
of signatures, their submission beyond the deadline, or obvious 
frauds.

  [Text] The final showdown in the Republican Party: Party 
secretary Giorgio La Malfa, who chose to ally the party with 
Mario Segni and Mino Martinazzoli in the forthcoming election, 
is expelling such venerable figures as Bruno Visentini and 
Giorgio Bogi because they chose to ally themselves with the 
progressive alignment. Mario De Scalzi reports: 
  [De Scalzi] The Italian Republican Party [PRI] is expelling 
part of its history, and the expeller is party secretary Giorgio 
La Malfa, who still remains secretary despite his problems over 
alleged illegal funding to his party. La Malfa is proposing the 
expulsion of the venerable Bruno Visentini, the former president 
of the party, Giorgio Bogi, the present deputy secretary of the 
party, and Libero Gualtieri. Visentini, Bogi, and Gualtieri 
are, according to the party secretary, nothing less than 
heretics. Their sin was to choose to ally themselves with the 
progressives of the Democratic Alliance, rather than the center 
led by Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular 
Party]. This comes about despite the fact that La Malfa warned 
that this would happen at the last party conference. 
  The polemic-laden winds that are blowing through Italian 
politics and which have divided Socialists, Christian Democrats, 
Communists, and many others, have not spared the small party. 
However, it is unimaginable to think of a PRI without either 
the aristocratic aloofness of Visentini or the English pomp of 
Giorgio Bogi.

  [Text] Ankara -- Turkish Cypriot President Rauf Denktas has 
accused the United Nations of supporting the stronger side in 
Cyprus by considering the Greek Cypriot government as the 
legitimate representative of the whole island. 
  Denktas said that by this attitude the United Nations had 
paved the way for an endorsement of all the evil that this side 
has done over the past 30 years to the Turkish Cypriots. 
  Denktas was addressing a conference in Kyrenia on Saturday 
organized by the Turkish United Nations Association and entitled 
"The United Nations and the Cyprus question." 
  Denktas said that the United Nations today was still an 
organization that the larger countries saw as a platform for 
promoting their own interests. 
  He added that these countries were trying to solve the 
Cyprus 
problem without having analyzed it properly, and were putting 
forward proposals which had been prepared without sounding out 
the actual parties to the dispute. 
  "(Former Cypriot President Archbishop) Makarios tried in 
1963 
to destroy the republic of Cyprus, which was based on a 
partnership, by force of arms and to establish a Greek Republic. 
The Turkish Cypriots never consented to the administration of 
Makarios. This is the dispute," Denktas said. 
  He added that as long as the usurpation of the Presidency of 
Cyprus by force of arms is not ended then a solution to the 
problem of Cyprus could not be found, "because this problem had 
been created in order for the Presidency to be occupied by 
force." 
  Denktas said that the Greek Cypriots had hidden behind the 
title of "the legitimate government of Cyprus" and repeated that 
the Cyprus question was the result of this usurpation by the 
Greek Cypriots. 
  "The moment you get rid of the usurper the Cyprus problem is 
solved" he insisted. 
  The Turkish Cypriot President went on to add that the Greek 
Cypriot side was making all its calculations on the assumption 
that it would be accepted as a member of the European Union, 
mainly in order to get rid of Turkey's right of guarantee over 
the status of Cyprus. 
  If such membership is granted the Greek Cypriots, he went on 
to say, this would tip the balance on the island. 
  Providing an example for the attitude of large countries, 
Denktas cited the case of the United States, and pointed out 
that in the bimonthly report presented by President Bill Clinton 
to Congress the Greek Cypriot leader was always referred to as 
the President of Cyprus. 
  Denktas said that they had always objected to this. He added 
that when he had brought the matter up with the U.S. ambassador 
in Nicosia the previous day the ambassador, "in a very honest 
and friendly manner," had said, "I do not want to mislead you 
on this. This is the way matters stand and this is the way they 
will remain. There exist neither the means for the conditions to 
change this." 
  Denktas declared: "It becomes clear in this manner how U.N. 
principles are implemented and where they want to take us. We 
never mentioned this before but we are in a position to oppose 
if from now on." 
  Referring to the package of confidence building measures put 
forward by the United Nations, Denktas said that this also 
revealed an attempt to deprive the Turkish side of its basic 
rights. 
  "They are doing everything in their power to implement the 
scenario in their own minds and to pressurize us, as if the 
things we are saying are not important," Denktas said. 
  He went on to underline that a solution for the Cyprus 
problem was something that was necessary for the Turkish side in 
the first instance, because it was the side that was faced with 
an embargo whereas the Greek side was availing itself of all the 
advantages of the world. 
  "For the Cyprus problem to be solved means for the Greek 
Cypriots to step down from the claim of legitimate government," 
Denktas added.

<F P=106> ["ub"-signed report: "Bonn: EU Will Gain in Stability, </F>
Security"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- For German foreign policy, the conclusion 
of European Union [EU] entry negotiations with Sweden, Finland, 
and Austria (Norway is considered to be part of the package) is 
of utmost strategic importance. It is the first step toward 
safeguarding security and stability in Europe after the Cold 
War, the Foreign Ministry said. This urgently required 
safeguarding is the focus of EU expansion. 
  During the long nights in Brussels, Bonn had to play a 
central role in order to avoid a failure, high-ranking diplomats 
participating in the talks said. A first analysis said that, 
after five days and three nights of dramatic struggles, the EU 
has now regained its balance. The entry of the Nordic countries 
and Austria will end the tilt toward the south. The north will 
support German foreign policy in terms of integrating Central 
and East Europe. The north of Europe has a different 
sensitivity for the new problems arising at the end of the Cold 
War. Many members of the current Union are still caught in a 
reactive frame of mind. Some of these countries seem to be 
sitting in a television chair watching whether Central and East 
Europe get to their feet or break down. An analysis of the 
situation to the east of the Union is far from reassuring. This 
is why strategic changes will have to be made in the Union's way 
of thinking and acting. The entry of the new members -- 
provided that an agreement is achieved with Norway and 
membership is approved in the referendums -- will be helpful in 
this respect. 
  Diplomats taking part in the negotiations said it was no 
exaggeration to say the agreement was reached only because the 
Germans made the others feel the full weight of their new role 
in the center of Europe. In fact, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
had not accepted postponing the decisions, thus requiring all 
participants to come together. Several times, when the 
negotiations threatened to fail, he simply refused to get up and 
leave. Germany faced a challenge and made its point, the 
Foreign Ministry said. If the negotiations had failed this 
would have indicated to the reform states that the West 
Europeans do not even want to accept the rich countries in the 
north, not to speak of the others in the East. 
  If Norway wants, things will work out fairly quickly in 
Brussels, the Foreign Ministry said. As in Finland's case, 
securing the transatlantic connection is vital for Norway. Yet, 
the referendums that are still to be held will not be a 
walkover. The Germans have internally been accused of selling 
off the EU cheaply. But Bonn was guided by the idea of helping 
the governments of the applicant countries alleviate the short 
pain of adjustment so that everything can get back to normal 
quickly, the Foreign Ministry said.

<F P=106> ["g-n."-attributed report: "Crisis Management Only With the </F>
Alliance"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 1 March -- As the conference of NATO 
heads of state and heads of governments agreed in January, apart 
from performing its ongoing defense task, NATO should be turned 
into an instrument for preventative diplomacy and the control of 
international conflicts. The Bundeswehr general inspector, 
General Naumann, insists that this should not occur at the 
expense of the first task, the ability to defend, and in the 
case of "conflict management," the alliance should also be able 
to act alone, that is, independently of a UN mandate. He warns 
against abandoning the usual NATO organizational framework, that 
is cooperation under an integrated command structure, in the 
event of crisis management, and forming ad hoc coalitions 
between individual nations, which would encourage the 
reintroduction of national elements into European policy and 
reduce alliance cohesion. This would also apply to cooperation 
with the Americans. The relationship should not be called into 
question by the Europeans, nor should the Europeans do anything 
that would encourage the Americans to give in to tendencies to 
give up the idea of collective Western foreign and security 
policy. "Crisis management" also requires collective action. 
  The general inspector recently set out his thoughts and 
concerns to the German-British Officers Association in Bad 
Neuenahar. He warned against pursuing collective crisis 
management, which has moved to the forefront of alliance policy 
since the Brussels NATO conference, at the expense of collective 
security. Both elements must be maintained. His observations 
not only clearly referred to tendencies toward an "ad hoc 
approach" in France, but also among other allies. "We must 
reorganize, but without splitting up the integrated command 
structure." He expressly warned against performing assignments 
under Article 4 of the NATO Treaty (crisis) using organizational 
forms other than the customary and proven ones of the integrated 
command structure for the event of Article 5 (the duty to 
provide support in defense cases). The failure of Western 
policy with regard to the war in the Balkans and in Somalia are 
the concrete background for these thoughts. Naumann's 
assessment has received the backing of the current NATO 
commander of the Northern Group of Forces, Sir Charles Guthrie, 
and of two of his predecessors, General Sir Peter Inge and Field 
Marshal Sir Nigel Bagnall, as well as the former commander of 
the NATO Central Europe Force, General von Sandrart. 
<H5>  The Threat Axis Has Shifted South </H5>
  The general inspector used the opportunity to discuss new 
elements of German security policy. Following 1989, the NATO 
"threat axis" has shifted from the east to the "south." This 
has imposed considerably more work on the NATO Southern Europe 
Command (Naples). However, as before, the European central 
region, Germany, France, and the British and U.S. forces on the 
continent, remains the region that would be most involved in 
crisis management irrespective of where the crisis is. "The 
focus of NATO military policy will remain the central region, 
even if in future conflicts will tend to be in the south." 
  The German general inspector and General Guthrie, who are in 
agreement on the matter, blamed the failure of the deployment of 
Western forces in both the conflicts in the Balkans and Somalia 
on ignoring Clausewitz's maxim that a political goal must be set 
before forces are deployed. Both generals fear that, in future, 
this will also be a problem for collective crisis management, 
especially as in the case of crisis management, differences of 
opinion stemming from national interests are more likely to come 
to the fore than in the event of collective defense against a 
direct attack. 
  Soldiers need clear political goals, said Guthrie, 
sufficient 
resources to be certain of accomplishing their task, and 
instructions to make preparations as soon as possible, meaning 
that time was required to improve soldiers' training for special 
assignments in foreign environments. However, said Guthrie, 
politicians generally find it difficult to set the military a 
clear political assignment in good time, because politicians 
seek to keep options open for as long as possible and when 
action is finally taken, they then say that things can be done 
very quickly and simply without much expenditure. "Politicians 
seldom give us sufficient reserves for materiel, personnel, and 
mobilization. They believe that the job can be done with less." 
  General Naumann pointed out that since the great changes 
that 
have occurred in the threat situation since 1989, it is true 
that objectively, the "warning time" for performing a defense 
role has risen to about a year, but militarily "effective 
warning time" only amounted to between three and six months, 
because political leaderships hesitate in identifying a 
dangerous situation and issuing the appropriate instructions to 
the military leadership. This particularly applies to 
identifying a "crisis." Today, crises are no longer a short 
transition period between peace and war, but a third state that 
might last longer and is marked by ambiguous signals and 
contradictory threats. That makes decisions on prevention and 
action instead of reaction more difficult. The contradictory 
nature of "signals" and the ups and downs in a crisis result in 
"free reign" being given to the situation, as was the case with 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Naumann showed that crisis management entailing 
"peacekeeping" or "peacemaking" -- General Inge pointed out that 
the two were very close, the one might apply to one village and 
other to the next village, or they might rapidly alternate in 
the same place -- cannot be pursued at the expense of defense by 
citing a simple example. If the Bundeswehr must make 50,000 men 
available for deployment in a crisis, then it could either only 
send a small number of the men to another country, because 
others would have to remain for training and replacement 
purposes, or it would have to mobilize reservists, because 
otherwise the Bundeswehr's main task, the ability to provide 
collective defense, could not be fulfilled. 
<H5>  Without a Mandate From the UN or the CSCE </H5>
  A British general pointed out that until now NATO had 
permitted individual nations to remove troops from NATO 
obligations to special emergency situations temporarily (for 
example, U.S. troops during the Vietnam War and British troops 
during the Falklands War). That was possible because other 
allies could fill the gaps. This is another reason why "crisis 
management" cannot be divorced from defense and both have to be 
pursued collectively as an alliance. 
  There is no way in which one could have two sets of troops, 
one for defense and the other for "overseas crisis management." 
It would also be impossible to form two leadership structures. 
It is particularly important to strengthen those elements that 
"multiply" the armed forces, for example, resources for 
intelligence, leadership, and rapid (air and sea) transportation 
of forces. Without the Americans, there would be insufficient 
intelligence for the foreseeable future and without the 
alliance, there would be no experienced leadership for the 
command of the armed forces of several countries. He repeated 
once again that ad hoc cooperation was not enough. 
  General Naumann said that if Germany wants to participate in 
solving an international crisis, then essentially one must be 
ready to deploy troops and one cannot hide behind supposed 
prohibitions based on German history or behind the German 
Constitution. It is also just as important that NATO should see 
such action as its own affair and not allow itself to be turned 
into the recipient of UN or CSCE mandates, because there will be 
situations in which neither the UN or the CSCE will be able to 
adopt decisions. The Federal Republic would never act alone, 
without its allies, in defense or in crisis management.

<F P=106> ["C. G."-initialled report: "Complaints About a Lack of </F>
Understanding"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 1 March -- On Tuesday [1 March], Azerbaijan's 
Foreign Minister Hassanov had a meeting in Bonn with Development 
Minister Spranger and officials from the Foreign Ministry, 
during which his country's conflict with Armenia over the 
enclave of Nagorny-Karabakh was discussed. Hassanov complained 
about a lack of understanding on Germany's part and said that 
Germany was favorably disposed toward Armenia's position. The 
Azerbaijani Foreign Minister was unable to meet his host, 
Foreign Minister Kinkel. Kinkel had remained in Brussels, 
because of the negotiations with Austria and Finland on 
admission to the European Union. He wrote Hassanov a letter in 
which he said that the Federal Government was ready to cooperate 
with Azerbaijan and work out a joint statement that would serve 
as the basis for the development of relations. Kinkel asked 
Hassanov to wait for him in Bonn, but the Azerbaijani foreign 
minister left and observed in annoyance that he had enough to do 
in Baku and had to meet the Swedish chairman of the CSCE working 
group responsible for Nagorny-Karabakh, Elaisson, on Wednesday. 
Spranger wants to send one of his ministry officials to 
Azerbaijan to examine project opportunities. This is to be 
followed by the drawing up of a program for cooperation. 
  Hassanov spoke to Bundestag Deputy Wimmer, the chairman of 
the parliamentary group dealing with the Caucasus. Wimmer wants 
to bring about a meeting between Azerbaijani and Armenian 
deputies in Germany. Hassanov said that Azerbaijani deputies 
were ready to take part in such a meeting. The Armenians have 
yet to agree. The Azerbaijanis have as little against Wimmer's 
mediation attempt, which is to bring about negotiations between 
the deputies on finding a solution to the dispute over 
Nagorny-Karabakh, as they do against the intentions of Russia 
and Turkey to become involved in finding ways to reach 
agreement. The initiative came from Wimmer, but Azerbaijan 
would also like "Germany to be actively involved in finding a 
solution to the problem." 
  Azerbaijan has only one condition for an end to the 
fighting: 
"Armenian troops must withdraw from the occupied territories." 
  Azerbaijan is prepared to negotiate over a "guarantee 
status" 
for the Armenians living in Nagorny-Karabakh. Hassanov 
described such guarantees as "special rights." International 
observers, above all the CSCE, could be involved in determining 
the content of the guarantees. The Armenians living in the 
enclave could have the same "full rights" as the Azerbaijanis. 
This would not affect the question of belonging to the 
Azerbaijani state. Speaking in Bonn, Hassanov charged that 
Armenia wants to carve up sovereign Turkish territory with the 
help of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], the Kurdish 
underground organization. By contrast, Azerbaijan maintained 
"clear interstate relations" with Turkey, relations that were 
constantly becoming closer. Azerbaijan's embassy in the Federal 
Republic is housed in the Turkish Embassy building. 
  Hassanov was not keen to talk about developments in Russia 
and their possible consequences for Moscow's relations with 
other states that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. 
Hassanov reacted with apparent incomprehension to questions 
about Russian imperial aspirations, such as have been noted in 
the Baltic republics. Hassanov said that in contrast to the 
Baltic republics, there were no Russian troops stationed in 
Azerbaijan. There were neither official or unofficial 
statements emanating from Moscow that allow one to conclude that 
Russia wished to establish military bases in Azerbaijan. The 
release of the putschists Khasbulatov and Rutskoy was an 
internal Russian matter and the result of a decision made by the 
Russian parliament. After Azerbaijan achieved independence in 
1989, relations with Russia at first cooled. Now, however, 
after President Aliyev came to power, efforts were being made 
"continually to improve relations." The process is underway. 
Aliyev was a member of the Moscow Politburo during Soviet times.

  [Text] Goettingen (DDP/ADN) -- The Society for Threatened 
Peoples (GfbV) has accused Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of 
being partially responsible for the war crimes Croatians carried 
out in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Tilman Zuelch, the head of the 
society, said today that although Kinkel had been fully aware of 
the Croatian human rights violations and war crimes, he had not 
made any serious efforts to put pressure of the Croatian 
Government. 
  Zuelch was speaking in connection with a GfbV report 
submitted to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva on 
Croatian human rights violations against the civilian population 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The report accuses Croatian troops in 
particular of confining and starving 55,000 Muslim deportees and 
displaced persons in the town of Mostar for months, of razing 
towns through large-scale bombardment, and of killing hundreds 
of civilians.

<F P=106> [Interview with Herbert Schnoor, interior minister of North </F>
Rhine-Westphalia: "`Then Everybody Will Stay Here;' About the 
Controversy Over Croatian Refugees"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schnoor, according to the 
unanimous resolution by the interior ministers of the Federal 
Republic and the laender, Croatian civil war refugees are to 
leave the country by the end of April. You have suddenly changed 
your mind. Why? 
  [Schnoor] It simply won't do to send indiscriminately all 
Croatian refugees back to a country marked by civil war. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But you yourself have agreed to precisely this 
resolution. 
  [Schnoor] I agreed only on condition that the Federal 
Government and laender finance a repatriation program. It is to 
assist the refugees in making a new start in their homeland. 
Above all, we must create new housing. Only in this way can we 
avoid having the Bosnian Muslims who have fled to Croatia being 
driven out in turn and perhaps coming to the FRG. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Federal Interior Minister Manfred Kanther 
rejects participating in the financing of such a program. There 
is no money for it, he says. 
  [Schnoor] The Federal Government, laender, communities--none 
of us have any money. But that is no reason to simply send 
people away, or to let them starve here. For me, the agreement 
on deportation stands or falls with repatriation assistance. If 
the Federal Government thinks it has no money for that, then I 
can only call upon Mr. Kanther to revise our joint resolution. 
Then everybody will stay here. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And how do you intend to enforce that? 
  [Schnoor] I am bound by the extremely rigid Aliens Law. 
Nonetheless, I can order a general halt of deportations for six 
months. The crux is, however, that the refugees will be 
concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia, if the other laender 
don't go along. Naturally, it will also quickly get about among 
the refugees which land will not deport them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So you are not solving the problem, only 
shifting it. 
  [Schnoor] For a longer halt of deportations I do indeed need 
the approval of the federal interior minister, but not for other 
stipulations of the law. Thus I still have the possibility of 
examining individual cases. For example, I can instruct the 
authorities dealing with foreigners to exempt hardship cases 
from deportation. To me that means refugees from the occupied or 
destroyed part of Croatia, and those who have found refuge with 
relatives in North Rhine-Westphalia or come from ethnically 
mixed families. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What about deserters, whose fate will be 
totally uncertain in case of deportation? 
  [Schnoor] I would also exempt deserters from deportation if 
they can expect punishment in Croatia. If I should not come to 
an agreement this week with my laender colleagues on regulations 
for such hardship cases, we shall initiate examinations of 
individual cases in North Rhine-Westphalia. Thereby many people 
can be helped, and Mr. Kanther can't do anything about it. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Foreign Ministry situation reports from the 
respective crisis regions play a decisive role in the 
decisionmaking by authorities and courts on the deportation of 
refugees. Its content of truth is controversial. Contrary to the 
recommendations of the UN refugee commissioner, the Foreign 
Ministry sees hardly any obstacles to deportations to Angola, a 
country where there is civil war. Does the Federal Government 
want to get rid of the costly refugees at any price? 
  [Schnoor] I must defend the Foreign Ministry. I received 
good 
cooperation from the Foreign Ministry regarding refugees from 
Iraq, and in the case of Kurds from Turkey I had the best of 
experiences with the German ambassador in that country. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] At the end of January, the Berlin 
administrative court stopped the deportation of a refugee from 
Angola, because the judges considered press reports more 
credible than the Foreign Ministry information. And Frieder 
Birzele, your Social Democratic colleague in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
demands more precise information from the Foreign Ministry on 
the local situation, especially in the case of Croatia. 
  [Schnoor] For me, the Foreign Ministry reports are only one 
decision-making aid. In addition, we also rely on the knowledge 
gained by refugee organizations. Certainly, the Foreign Ministry 
now and then is taken in by an informant. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Many Social Democrats agreed to the new asylum 
law passed last year by the Bundestag only after the coalition 
and opposition came to an agreement on Section 32a of the Aliens 
Law which stipulates a special status for refugees from civil 
wars. In the case of the Croats, this stipulation has no effect 
because Bonn does not want to pay. 
  [Schnoor] It must not fail because of the petty souls in the 
Federal Government. The Federal Government must share half of 
the costs for civil war refugees; on this all interior ministers 
of the laender are agreed, even those of the Christian Union 
[CDU/CSU]. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Interior Minister Kanther is obstinate. He has 
stated that there is no money, and as long as the laender do not 
understand that, the special status for Croatian refugees will 
not be introduced. In agreeing to the asylum law, were the 
Social Democrats taken for a ride? 
  [Schnoor] I insist: We must breathe life into Section 32a. 
If 
no accord can be reached with the federal government on its 
financing, we must look for other ways. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But no way bypasses Kanther? 
  [Schnoor] Perhaps, yes. I can imagine, for example, that I 
might ask the North Rhine-Westphalian finance minister to 
withhold money for the refugees from those taxes which we pay 
over to the Federal Government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] A blocked account as a means of political 
pressure? This would be a novel approach in German domestic 
policy. 
  [Schnoor] The new asylum law has greatly restricted the 
possibility of people finding refuge in Germany. The stipulation 
for civil war refugees should make it clear that the FRG stands 
in the humanitarian tradition of West Europe. Like many others, 
for years I fought against a change of Article 16 of the Basic 
Law. Only the stipulation of a special status for civil war 
refugees in the law enabled me to consent, albeit with clenched 
teeth. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] As long as there is no agreement on the 
special 
status, civil war refugees will continue to go through asylum 
procedures. 
  [Schnoor] What that means is absolutely clear: They are 
turned down and deported. That is the present practice which the 
federal interior minister apparently has in mind as a permanent 
regulation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Don't the interior ministers of the laender 
make it easy for him, since the resolutions by the conference of 
interior ministers must be adopted unanimously? 
  [Schnoor] Yes. Mr. Kanther is tricking the laender. Because 
of the different interests of the laender, the resolutions 
almost always are adopted at the lowest common denominator. For 
extending the halt in deporting civil war refugees, Kanther 
insists on the unanimous vote of 16 laender ministers. But for 
his approval, actually he does not even need this assent. With 
this demand he plainly diverges from the clear-cut legal 
situation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why do you let him get away with it? 
  [Schnoor] I don't intend to. I want even more. I shall make 
every effort to ensure that on such an important issue as the 
civil war refugees, not the conference of interior ministers, 
but rather the majority in the Bundesrat must give its consent. 
In the Bundesrat, a simple majority is enough to decide which 
refugees under which conditions will be deported, or not.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Hufelschulte and M. Krischer: "Liaison Man of </F>
the RAF"] 
  [Text] The news from the FRG Interior Ministry came by 
telephone. The caller urged that senior official Karl B. be 
immediately transferred to another department of the Federal 
Office of Criminal Investigations (BKA). 
  In the BKA president's staff in Wiesbaden, the explosive 
nature of the official order was immediately clear. After a 
brief note about the telephone conversation, the high-ranking 
official picked up the stamp and put "confidential -- official 
secret" on the piece of paper. No one should learn what 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and his State Secretary Kurt 
Schelter had just ordered on 2 February 1994. 
  The banishment from Bonn hits a dedicated BKA official who 
has caused serious problems for the German security authorities, 
which have difficulties anyway, and who is now radically 
condemned to silence -- eight months after the counterterror 
operation in Bad Kleinen. 
  Senior official Karl B., who was the head of BKA 
Counterterrorism Department No. 11, found out: 
  There is a high probability that Klaus Steinmetz, the 
alleged 
spy of the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution in the Red Army Faction [RAF], is a leading RAF 
activist. 
  The man who put the investigators on the trail of Birgit 
Hogefeld and Wolfgang Grams in Bad Kleinen in June 1993 was a 
top RAF courier and obviously knew about secret terror 
operations. He kept everything to himself, however, and did not 
tell his controllers at the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution about his knowledge. 
  The official BKA paper, which was drawn up by Karl B. and 
which immediately disappeared into a drawer because of the 
relentless analysis, permits only one conclusion: 
  Steinmetz cheated the authorities. He cheated the 
Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution as well as the chief federal prosecutor, who 
suspended proceedings against him on 28 January. 
  "The investigations," Hans-Juergen Foerster of the Chief 
Federal Prosecutor's Office says, "did not give sufficient 
reason to publicly indict him." 
  A BKA official told FOCUS: "They are glad Steinmetz is gone 
now. They do not want to ask him anything any more. They do 
not want any answers that would be embarrassing -- embarrassing 
in particular for those who controlled Steinmetz as a liaison 
man and who would now have to realize that they had lost control 
of him and that he might have committed crimes while they 
protected him." 
  Steinmetz, who is hidden somewhere and being prepared for a 
new life with a new identity abroad, would have to face 
indictment according to the uncomfortable BKA paper. 
  According to the findings by the terrorism experts, the guy, 
who describes himself as a minor cog and mediator between two 
camps, is in reality a big shot. As one can read on page 17 of 
the BKA dossier, he is considered to be a person who "is tightly 
integrated in RAF structures" and can probably "be called a 
supporting member of the RAF." 
  According to the BKA analysis, Steinmetz never took the 
truth 
very seriously. His statements are "incredible" and "in 
complete contradiction" with BKA findings "on essential topics." 
  The alleged liaison man claims to have established contact 
with the RAF command echelon in autumn 1991 in Metz, France. He 
claims to have met Hogefeld and Grams, who were caught in Bad 
Kleinen, in Paris in February 1992. After evaluating all 
evidence, the BKA investigators are certain that he had access 
to the RAF command echelon much earlier. 
  Steinmetz also gave a bad impression with his statements 
about the spectacular RAF attack on the prison in Weiterstadt on 
27 March 1993. 
  Shortly after the operation in Bad Kleinen, he claimed that 
he had learned about the forthcoming bombing of the super 
prison. Steinmetz later made a turnabout when interrogated by 
the BKA and the Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office. "I did not 
know anything about that beforehand," he dictated to the 
reporters and was thus permitted -- the investigating 
authorities knew about the interview -- to present himself 
publicly as innocent. 
  The explosive BKA report leads to other conclusions: 
  Klaus Steinmetz, to whom the RAF gave the cover name 
"Bruno," 
was obviously a top courier of the terrorists who had gone 
underground. He transported documents that, according to the BKA 
dossier, "would permit profound insight into the communication 
structures if the police got hold of them." 
  A task that no one -- and quite certainly not the strictly 
secret RAF command echelon -- would entrust to a "minor cog." 
  The transport of "structurally relevant secret messages," as 
the BKA analysis says about the Steinmetz role, "is probably 
assigned to such persons to whom both the sender and also, in 
particular, the recipient (illegals, RAF members for whom there 
is an arrest warrant) have a long tested and intensive 
relationship of trust." 
  One insider told FOCUS: "Now they are all fluttering with 
fear. After the BKA stock-taking, one must necessarily 
investigate the question of whether the liaison man perhaps knew 
about assassination attacks beforehand, such as about the ones 
on Rohwedder and Herrhausen." 
  Karl B., who is renowned in the BKA because of this expert 
qualifications, suddenly felt an icy wind blowing in his face 
after he had presented his report. 
  Reportedly, he was three times requested to formulate his 
findings about the true role of liaison man Steinmetz 
differently. Karl B., called Charly by his colleagues, stuck to 
his version. The result: The hot document was stamped "not 
usable in court." 
  The Chief Federal Prosecutor's Office, the master of the 
investigations, reacted with irritation to the official, whose 
analysis threatened to torpedo the suspension of the 
investigations against Steinmetz. In a talk with BKA President 
Hans-Ludwig Zachert in January 1994, Karlsruhe Senior Prosecutor 
Gerhard Loechner is said to have harshly criticized the tense 
relationship between the two authorities. The scapegoat was 
found quickly: senior BKA official Karl B. 
  However, also internally, both in the Wiesbaden BKA and at 
the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution in Mainz, Charly the Steadfast caused big trouble 
with his report. The reason: Important evidence has 
disappeared. 
  The background: According to BKA investigations, Steinmetz 
was handed a particular cargo one day before the operation in 
Bad Kleinen. Wolfgang Grams wanted to send two glasses of red 
currant jam to his parents. Birgit Hogefeld reportedly gave 
Steinmetz two personal letters. After examining the typewriter 
ribbon, it was concluded that one letter was for her mother, the 
other one for a women from the supporters' scene, who uses the 
cover name Vicky. 
  After the GSG-9 operation the Rhineland-Palatinate Office 
for 
the Protection of the Constitution took over Steinmetz' cargo. 
During an interrogation by the BKA Counterterrorism Department 
No. 24 of 24 August 1993, official G. remembered the jam -- 
however, he claimed not to know anything about the letters. It 
is, however, these two mysteriously missing letters that make 
Steinmetz' great importance in the RAF structure clear, the 
suppressed BKA dossier indicates. 
  In the future, the uncomfortable senior official Karl B. is 
supposed to keep his hands off terrorists. As of 1 March 1994, 
he will be transferred to another department -- the Interior 
Ministry has refused any comments about the background of this 
transfer. 
  Charly, the experienced RAF hunter, now has to keep 
statistics about drug-related crimes.

<F P=106> [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE report: "Nothing Was Hushed Up in </F>
the Steinmetz Case"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 28 February -- The FRG Interior Ministry 
and the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) denied on 
Monday [28 February] that disagreeable findings on a leading 
role of informer Steinmetz in the Red Army Faction (RAF) had 
been held back. They also denied press reports that the author 
of a relevant report in the BKA had been transferred against his 
will by Interior Minister Kanther (Christian Democratic Union). 
The Interior Ministry spokesman reported that Kanther and 
Schelter, state secretary in the Interior Ministry, neither 
expressed the wish nor gave the instruction to transfer the 
official. According to the BKA statement, the authors of the 
report saying that the informer was probably a "leading member" 
of the RAF had themselves evaluated the paper as unfit to be 
used by a court. This means that it is unsuited for 
investigating files of the public prosecutor, but it is an 
assessment. The authors, however, had never been urged by 
superiors or external authorities to change or withdraw the 
report. The contents of the report have been taken into account 
in the current investigations, also regarding Steinmetz, and 
were sent to the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office on 26 
October 1993. The internal transfer of the head of the section 
for terrorism was carried out in the BKA alone and with the 
agreement of the official, it was stated. Meanwhile, the BKA 
has tried to find out who might have passed the controversial 
information to the press. Since the beginning of last week, the 
prosecuting authority is carrying out investigations in the BKA 
because of the suspicion that official secrets were disclosed.

<F P=106> [Article by "me": "Toepfer Prevents Closing of Biblis </F>
Nuclear Power Plant"] 
  [Text] Wiesbaden, 1 Mar -- FRG Environment Minister Klaus 
Toepfer, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], has issued a federal 
order to prevent a Hesse closure notice for the Biblis A nuclear 
power plant from being issued on Tuesday [1 March]. Hesse 
Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens) had previously 
announced in the afternoon that he would order the 
Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Electrizitaetswerk (RWE) operating 
company temporarily to close the nuclear plant, which was put 
into service in 1974. 
  In the morning, Fischer had obtained the support of the 
red-green land government. The Hesse supervisory authorities 
have serious doubts about the plant's safety, since RWE did not 
put additional safety equipment into Biblis A within the 
three-year period, as ordered by former Hesse Environment 
Minister Karlheinz Weimar (CDU) in 1992, and meanwhile has filed 
a complaint against this order. Biblis A is the oldest reactor 
in all of Germany with a capacity of more than 1,000 megawatts. 
The reactor is currently switched off for routine checks and, 
according to RWE plans, it is to be put into operation again 
next Tuesday. 
  If Hesse gets its way, this would be the first time that a 
German land closed down a nuclear power plant for an extended 
period against the will of the operating company because of a 
marked need for equipment on several counts. RWE would then have 
to undertake major reconstruction work before the plant is put 
into service again -- among other things, for improved fire 
protection and an earthquake-safe cooling system. Toepfer also 
thinks this equipment is necessary "within an appropriate 
period," but he no longer gives a definite deadline. 
  According to the Bonn order, Fischer is now forced to keep 
still -- for the time being -- until a "federal supervisory 
talk" at civil servant level takes place on Thursday.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Robert Leicht: "The Chancellor's Final </F>
Battle"] 
  [Text] The chancellor in the role of Baron von 
Muenchhausen: a politician trying to draw himself out of the mud 
by his own hair. That Helmut Kohl is entering his last battle is 
certain; he has said often enough that he wanted to know it once 
more. It would be more than a miracle in many respects if it 
were to become his last victory. 
  Never before in the history of the FRG has a government 
party 
entered an election campaign under such miserable conditions. 
Since Helmut Kohl came to power, the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] has lost more and more votes from one election to the next 
in western Germany. This is true even for the seemingly 
triumphant unity election of 1990; then it was only the 
exuberant expectations of eastern Germans that made the result 
appear more favorable for the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU]. 
Yet four years later, Kohl no longer can count on this special 
bonus. On the contrary, eastern Germany will have a significant 
negative impact on the CDU's 1994 election balance. 
  Never before in the history of the FRG was a chancellor 
given 
a full mandate four times in a row. When Konrad Adenauer ran 
for the fourth time in 1961 -- which, by the way, was also 
preceded by a dramatic miscalculation regarding the election of 
the federal president -- the main reason the government alliance 
won a majority again was that one of the coalition partners, the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], had promised the voters 
with great success regarding the subsequent support: with the 
CDU, but without Adenauer. Hence, the "old man" had to put up 
with a humiliating election capitulation: He was only allowed to 
stay in power for another two years. 
  A look back into tradition shows that the fourth legislative 
term requires a particularly compelling justification. Yet 
where should it be found? After 12 years in power, what new 
things would a government still have to offer? How should a 
government head be ready to achieve what he failed to do three 
times before -- and all that in view of the enormous effects of 
wear and tear of such an office? 
  In the case of Kohl, one must add that, politically, even a 
miraculous victory in the Bundestag election would only lead 
into a dead-end street. By then the CDU will, in great 
likelihood, have lost its majority in two laender in eastern 
Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] will 
have gained a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag. Thus, Kohl 
is entering a battle he cannot win even if he succeeds but, at 
the most, he can achieve a nerve-killing blockade. Is it worth 
at all to fight for that? 
  Helmut Kohl -- and this could also be seen from his 
appearance at the Hamburg CDU Congress -- responds to this 
impossible challenge with a breakneck mixture of cool realism 
and sheer loss of reality. In this situation, he is exclusively 
banking on the one thing that he never had: the bonus of the 
chancellor. This self-entreatment has been so breathtaking that 
even his eternal critic, Heiner Geissler -- one of the few who 
neither has anything to lose nor can immediately profit -- said 
in sarcastic admiration and with a lot of chutzpah: "Only he 
who is impressed by himself is able to impress others." 
  Le parti, c'est moi -- The party, that is I: It was in this 
sense that Helmut Kohl so successfully reduced the CDU to his 
own person, that now -- so much for his realism -- he is really 
only able to rely on himself. The phalanx of secretaries 
general whom he personally selected and dropped again is a 
symbol for this process: from Biedenkopf to Geissler, Ruehe, and 
Peter Hintze, who is absolutely unable to fulfill this task. 
Yet the brutal realism of Helmut Kohl also includes the 
understanding that none of those who the chancellor and party 
chairman dropped, and whose fall he was observing with delight, 
has so far had the guts to challenge him openly and efficiently 
coordinated at a party congress. 
  This is why it was all to easy for Kohl to make a cynical 
appeal in Hamburg when he said: Those who want can voice their 
opposition at the party congress; but after it, you have to 
obey. End of the debate! Yet in reality -- so much for his 
loss of reality -- Kohl would have to rely on all of them 
particularly in this very situation, and particularly in their 
plurality and their spirit of contradiction: the Biedenkopfs, 
Geisslers, Suessmuths, Albrechts, Spaeths.... 
  Helmut Kohl as Baron von Muenchhausen: It is consistent 
and it is pure autosuggestion into which he is fleeing. It is 
particularly there where he appears to be so present that he has 
become completely detached from reality. He is talking to 
spoiled people -- as if it had not been he who spoiled them in 
the last dozen years. He preaches the necessity to think along 
different lines -- as if it had not been he who gave the voters 
the illusion that things could remain the same even after 
unification. Whenever he denounces the stubborn voters, the 
inhabitants of the "collective leisure park," then it does not 
require a lot of psychological understanding to recognize the 
projections of a man who himself failed to understand the signs 
of the time. This makes one think of Bert Brecht and ask 
oneself whether it would not be better for the government to 
elect a new people. 
  Realistically again, the chancellor follows the scent: It is 
time for a change. And having lost his sense of reality once 
more, he believes that the genuine chancellor of the change is 
-- he himself. The whole thing is so absurd that it really 
almost becomes impressive. 
  Reality does not stand a chance against such entreatments 
for reality itself. Bad surveys are not taken seriously. 
Indeed, they themselves are based on a high number of voters 
who are still undecided -- who, in turn, are in their large 
majority part of the potential of the CDU. Besides, all the old 
parties have lost support. Therefore, they have to mobilize the 
voters -- and to play foul. That Rau used to be Kohl's favorite 
candidate for succeeding President Weizsaecker -- what does it 
matter? It is reason enough to denigrate him now. That in the 
Bundestag -- after all, reconciliation was the order of the day 
at the time -- Kohl solemnly set out to follow the footsteps of 
the Brandt/Scheel and Schmidt/Genscher governments in the 
spheres of Ostpolitik and Germany policy -- who cares? Now one 
has to divide the voters by using the word treason. Yet, how 
does somebody intend to win the future with the wrong battles of 
the past? 
  At the party congress, Kohl once more managed to win the 
support of the delegates. Nothing else was to be expected. 
Yet, through his strategy of self-entreatment he managed to do 
better than expected. Still, to what extent can this rather 
internal effect be successful? One senior warrior quoted the 
old cliche: Without money it can never be as good as it is bad 
with money. Still, as of now it is no longer just the 
atmosphere that counts but the votes: Lower Saxony as a test 
election in western Germany, the European election, Saxony 
Anhalt as test election in eastern Germany -- all that is on the 
agenda even before the summer recess. 
  Helmut Kohl is entering his final battle. Many things are 
unique about this campaign. Apart from the temporary 
personality of Kiesinger, no chancellor has been unseated in a 
Bundestag election. Kohl is throwing himself into this combat 
true to the nice slogan of the generation of '68: You do not 
have any chance, so use it.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans-Werner Loose: "Resisting Bonn's Polish With </F>
Self-Irony: Minister for Women Merkel Calls Upon Stolpe To 
Resign--`He Got Involved in a Game With the Devil'"] 
  [Text] Bonn--She is Helmut Kohl's party vice chairman and 
the chancellor's pet in the cabinet. Next to the burned out 
comets Lothar de Maiziere, Guenther Krause, and Rainer Ortleb, 
she remained the fixed star in politics: Angela Merkel (39), 
federal minister for women and youth, the last in the group of 
the first hour from the east. 
  In the theater of Bonn, Angela Merkel does not dance for the 
grandstands. She stands so conspicuously inconspicuously in the 
first row as though applause is rather painful to her. She has 
laboriously shed her cocoon without turning into a butterfly. 
She emits a gentle radiance, whereas others try to light up the 
sky with the brilliance of their ideas. 
  The adjectives for her work range from "inconspicuous" to 
"persistent" and "unerring" and those for her person extend from 
"sensitive" and "vulnerable" to "courageous." The truth is that 
all of them fit. 
  In her three years in the west, the woman from the east has 
learned to swim in the tank with the sharks: "There are many 
here who are not as invulnerable as they appear to be." She has 
developed her sense for the political depths to the point where 
she can also perceive diffuse signals of power in time. Angela 
Merket has no desire to "acclimate herself through opportunism"; 
she prefers to "dress more warmly" against political cold waves. 
She uses self-irony to protect herself against being ground down 
in Bonn. 
  "The girl," as Helmut Kohl calls his minister, is the eldest 
of three children of a Hamburg pastor and a teacher. When Angela 
Dorothea Kasner was still in diapers, her father took over the 
pastorate in Quitzow near Templin. The family moved to the March 
of Brandenburg. 
  The girl knew the names of all the members of the GDR 
Politburo. But she could also recite "the entire cabinet of 
Konrad Adenauer and experienced the election of Gustav Heinemann 
as federal president through the radio in the school lavatory." 
  Angela Kasner majored in physics and graduated from the 
University of Leipzig in 1978, and received a doctorate in 1986 
with a dissertation on "The Calculation of the Velocity 
Constants of Elementary Reactions With the Example of Simple 
Carbohydrates." She learned how to tie the knot of the blue 
neckerchief of the Young Pioneers and perceived herself "as part 
of the GDR state and simultaneously lived in permanent rebellion 
against the system." Her motto at the time was this: "Anyone who 
does not do mischief, becomes stupid." In 1979, she married the 
physicist Ulrich Merkel. The childless marriage failed. 
  In 1989, as the GDR neared its end, Angela Merkel got 
involved as a publicity worker with the "Democratic Awakening" 
of Wolfgang Schnur and as assistant spokesperson of the last GDR 
Government under Lothar de Maiziere. In August 1990, she found a 
brief political home with the eastern CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union]. 
  After unification, she became a member of the first 
all-Germany Bundestag in Bonn through a direct candidacy in the 
Stralsund/Ruegen/Grimmen election district, receiving 48.5 
percent of the first votes. On 18 January 1991, Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl entrusted her with the new Ministry for 
Women and Youth. 
  The rise of Angela Merkel in the CDU is likewise one of the 
most abrupt political careers in postwar Germany: she became 
deputy chairman of the federal party after Lothar de Maziere 
resigned in December 1991, and she became chairman of the land 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania for the CDU after Guenther Krause 
resigned in June 1993. 
  The manager of the ministry -- 250 employees and an annual 
budget of 2.5 million marks -- hurries from nest to nest: 
"Unfortunately there is no time left for a real home": her 
political berths are on the Rhine and the Baltic Sea; her 
infrequent private resting place is Berlin, where her life 
companion lives. 
  Angela Merkel fights against the cliche of the chancellor's 
submissive foster daughter: "I admire Helmut Kohl, but that is 
not a relationship of submission." She allows herself to be used 
as a party soldier, "but I am not an accommodating woman." She 
proved that with a number of original initiatives: 

  -  In the 
fight about the rewording of the abortion Paragraph 218, she did 
loyally join the majority in the Union against the term solution 
but she set an accent of her own with the motto "help instead of 
punishment." 
  -  She presented the draft of a law on equality of 
rights, under which firms are supposed to prove that in their 
hiring they do not prefer male over female applicants, and she 
suffered the strong opposition of her parliamentary group. 
  -  She 
started the national action "No Violence Against Children" to 
curb the criminality with the largest number of unknown 
cases. 
  -  She engaged in frank discussion with radical rightist and 
leftist young people. 
  -  She called for "ethnology" as a compulsory 
subject in the schools because of the continuing violence 
against foreigners. 
  -  She called on the television establishments 
to limit sex and violence on the viewing screens. 
  -  She favored a 
general legal right to kindergarten spots. 
  The 60-kg woman is the talent that the CDU would like to use 
in the German east in the super election year. General Secretary 
Peter Hintze praises: "She is a credible representative of the 
democratic movement in the former GDR and a convincing performer 
in the Federal Government." 
  The last person in the first batch loves the soft tones of 
her favorite composer Mozart, because: "The one who shouts is 
usually wrong." She is not invulnerable: "If they hit me in the 
right place, they can really hurt me." 
  By now she can do that too. She thinks: "The discussion 
about 
the Stasi files should not be taboo"; there ought to be "no 
pause in the Stasi files because it happens to be election 
time." That is aimed above all at Brandenburg's 
Minister-President Manfred Stolpe (SPD) [Social Democratic Party 
of Germany], whom she sees as an "obstacle in dealing with the 
past of the GDR." Stolpe, she demands categorically, "must 
resign"; he has let himself "into a game with the devil that has 
led him into extreme situations." 
  The CDU woman with the bobbed hair looks at the framed 
portrait of Konrad Adenauer. It is the only picture in her new 
office on Rochusstrasse in Bonn. She then mounts a frontal 
attack against her opponent, just as the old man from Rhoendorf 
once did: "I was seldom as angry in the GDR as I was with the 
passage of the SPD-SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] paper. 
All of us there considered Hermann Axen and the others to be 
idiots and social democrats around Egon Bahr got involved with 
them and appealed to the same intellectual roots." 
  The dismantling of Saxon Minister of Justice Steffen 
Heitmann, who should have been federal president if it had been 
up to the chancellor and in accordance with her wishes, "really 
embittered her" and "was a disappointing experience on the way 
to German unification." Many in the west, she thinks, "obviously 
cannot imagine that someone from the east might do something 
right." The candidate from the east was asked the "sort of 
elementary questions that would not be allowed for a west German 
candidate--neither for Mr. Rau nor for Mr. Herzog."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lenient Nonperson--An Author's </F>
Transformation: Stefan Heym, Former SED Victim, Campaigns for 
the SED's Successor Party"] 
  [Text] The stubborn old fellow enjoyed the fuss about his 
person. Writer Stefan Heym, 80, felt as if he were back in his 
former job as a U.S. Army sergeant during World War II: "I am 
engaged in psychological warfare." So Heym permitted rumors to 
circulate for months on whether or not he would be a Bundestag 
candidate for the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. 
  He will. Last Sunday [6 February], the heirs of the Honecker 
party proudly presented Heym as their direct candidate for the 
Berlin-Center/Prenzlauer Berg electoral district. Says flashy 
PDS man Gregor Gysi: "A great thing." And eternal illusionist 
Heym in the lightning storm of flashbulbs: "I run as an 
independent candidate." 
  The two have arranged a mutually beneficial deal: The man of 
letters is assured of media attention, and the PDS can hope for 
a few more votes in the Bundestag election. 
  So far, however, almost all opinion researchers see little 
chance for the SED [Socialist Unity Party] successors to get 
above the 5-percent hurdle in October; the prognoses fluctuate 
between 3 and 4 percent of the votes. But Gysi and comrades bank 
on the PDS gaining at least three direct mandates; then the 
party would be sure of its Bundestag presence even below the 
5-percent cutoff. 
  The strategy is "Illustrious Names for Direct Election"--a 
will-o'-the-wisp like Guenther Maleuda, whom the SED had 
promoted as high as deputy chairman of the Council of State, let 
himself be wooed and won. 
  With someone like Stefan Heym, the PDS could actually outrun 
the competition in eastern Berlin. According to a Forsa poll, 31 
percent of the voters there will "definitely" vote for 
"prominent direct candidates" of the PDS, and 13 percent 
"perhaps." 
  According to election campaign manager Andre Brie, in the 
race for ballots the PDS seeks to win above all protest voters 
and "people attached to the GDR." So it is raging nostalgia for 
which Stefan Heym, the cool observer and critic of the GDR, 
becomes a willing tool. 
  At any rate, his sharp eye has dimmed increasingly since 
German unification. 
  "The old SED had me censored, watched and harassed," Heym 
sums up the years after he had graduated from the "eternal 
beating around the bush" and could publish bestsellers such as 
his novel "Collin" (1979) only in the West. The Stasi spied on 
the writer even in his bedroom. 
  The bestknown nonperson of the GDR after Wolf Biermann, he 
now shows leniency. With its offer the PDS signals not only 
"that its members have found a very different relationship with 
me than the crusty old comrades formerly had." At the same time, 
the PDS "makes clear that it is undergoing a process of internal 
change." So quickly do Honecker's heirs purify themselves. 
  The writer does not want to report on a PDS meeting where he 
could have tested his judgment. 
  Instead Heym proclaims "in the interest of the citizens of 
the GDR" a "true, strong, left opposition," together with the 
new fellow travelers. Most of all he would like to have along 
the SPD [Social Democratic Party], quite in line with the 
People's Front ideology, "if you will." 
  Since the turnaround, the mulish "superior Ossi" [eastern 
German] has called several times for similarly successful 
projects. On legendary 4 November 1989, speaker Heym believed 
that hundreds of thousands of East Berliners had assembled in 
Alexander Square not only "of their own free will for freedom 
and democracy," but also "for a socialism worthy of the name." 
  Shortly thereafter, after the opening of the Wall, Heym was 
shocked by a "fierce horde"--debased by the West--"which, 
pushing backs against bellies, streamed to Hertie and Bilka 
[department stores] in the chase of glittering junk." 
  Heym and other intellectuals, who had been permitted to get 
to know the West despite the Wall, protected themselves from the 
new, complicated reality. In the proclamation "For Our Country" 
they still saw a chance at the end of November 1989 "to develop 
a socialist alternative to the Federal Republic." 
  Later, it seemed sometimes as if the grand old man wanted to 
own up that the new reality overtaxes him. He once admitted in a 
small circle debating unification, crisis and the Stasi: "All 
that bores me." What does he find fascinating? Terse answer: 
"Myself." 
  But he did not withdraw to edit his novel about communist 
Karl Radek. In summer of 1992, the much-practiced first 
signatory lent his name once more, this time to the "Committee 
for Justice," founded jointly by Gysi and the CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] grumbler, Peter-Michael Diestel. 
  "Everyone in this country has a lobby," said Heym at the 
time, "only the people have none. We want to create that 
possibility now." The people rejected it, so its new wannabe 
tribune now himself looks for access to the rostrum. "If you 
call that vanity--I am so vain that I want to test whether 
people really like me." 
  Some are worried about the outcome of the experiment. For 
example, Lothar de Maiziere, the last GDR president, warned his 
friend Gysi: "Must you deface a monument?" 
  Deputy SPD Chairman Wolfgang Thierse, who is a candidate in 
the same electoral district as Heym, also questions whether his 
competitor "knows what he is doing to himself and his admirers 
by changing sides." 
  His rival evidently considers such friendly objections by 
politician and Germanic linguist Thierse a misunderstanding: 
Admirers are "buyers of my books"--and there were plenty of 
them. Heym cannot see a change in sides: Like the PDS, he had 
"always been for democracy and socialism, and I still am." 
  The 80-year-old candidate does not want to proclaim great 
tidings, and he promises nothing. Heym even distanced himself 
from the idea of at least assuring the voters: "I will not bore 
you." 
  The gray panther is looking forward with devilish glee to 
being able to open the 13th legislative period as president by 
age with a tremendous speech. Unless another party "finds an 
even nicer elderly gentleman than myself."

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Ziller: "Alliance 90/Greens Squabbling </F>
Over Foreign Policy: Differences Over Bundeswehr and 
NATO--Realos Want To Change Program Proposal at Election Party 
Congress"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 11 Feb--Alliance 90/Greens no longer want to 
appear as squabblers. The election party congress at the end of 
February is supposed to proceed with as few ideological 
skirmishes as possible. Commissions have therefore worked out 
broad program proposals that present disputed alternatives to a 
vote in only a few points. A failure, however, was the project 
"Unity" project in the foreign policy area. 
  After the end of the "Cold War" and the collapse of the 
Warsaw Pact, the time has come for a "new foreign policy," 
states the guiding proposal of the federal board for the 
election party congress. Instead of the "traditional foreign 
policy that pursues international policy in the national 
interest," the Alliance Greens want "a German policy in the 
international interest." They therefore favor a "concept of 
radical disarmament and self-integration in reformed 
international institutions" such as the United Nations and the 
CSCE. 
  The realpolitik camp of the party has no difficulties with 
such general formulas that arose under the guidance of Helmut 
Lippelt, member of the federal board. Differences show up where 
it is specifically a matter of the future of the Bundeswehr, 
NATO, and blue helmet missions. This is seen this week in 
extensive motions for amendments presented by the realpolitik 
camp for the party congress in Mannheim at the end of February. 
So far they have been signed, among others, by Achim Schmillen, 
a scientific associate of the Alliance Green group in the 
Bundestag, Hamburg realo Krista Sager, Reinhard Weisshuhn from 
Berlin, and Reinhard Buetikofer from Baden-Wuerttemberg. 
  The signers favor a long-term continuance of NATO. They want 
to proceed with the disarmament of the Bundeswehr in a less 
radical manner. In their view, Central and East European states 
should be offered access to a system for collective security. 
The "primary objective" of Greens foreign policy ought to be 
"the improvement of the protection of human rights." From this 
demand, the authors derive a duty to "intervene in the human 
rights conditions of other societies and states." 
  Spokesman of the federal board Ludger Volmer, who belongs to 
the left wing of the party, is counting on a tough fight in 
Mannheim: "If the motions for amendments are accepted, this 
ultimately means a reversal of our peace policy." As a result, 
he fears the expansion of NATO to the east and attempts to have 
human rights ultimately guaranteed through military 
intervention. Last year, after vigorous debate, a special party 
congress of the Greens had spoken out against military 
intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Achim Schmillen considers 
the board's motion to me completely inadequate. If the Greens 
persist in this, the Union and FDP [Free Democratic Party] would 
present them as a "security risk" in the election campaign for 
the Bundestag. 
  The guiding proposal of the federal board rejects an 
expansion of NATO to the east, for this would increase the 
"danger of a military confrontation." What it calls for is a 
"political initiative to dissolve NATO." In its place, it 
proposes the restructuring of the CSCE into a nonmilitary 
security organization. The Bundeswehr, states the proposal, 
cannot "be dissolved overnight." 
  Schmillen's motions for amendments, for which he expects the 
support of the realpolitik land associations in Hesse, 
Baden-Wuerttemberg, and Saxony, is likewise counting on a 
"strengthening of the CSCE process" as the basis for a 
collective security system. The CSCE is "already showing much 
promise of being able to meet an expanded notion of security 
that encompasses not only military strength but also the 
guarantee of human rights, democracy, development, and 
transparency." The way to a common European perspective on 
security policy cannot "exlude NATO." In the long term, it is to 
be brought into the CSCE process as its "security-policy arm."

<F P=106> [Commentary by former Labor Minister Herbert Ehrenberg: "A </F>
Low-Interest Growth Program Via the Bundesbank; The Economy 
Needs an Additional Push of Investments; The Financing"] 
  [Text] Most projections for economic development in western 
Germany assume stagnation of the gross national product, with 
slight divergences up or down. In the annual economic report, a 
growth rate of 0.5 to 1 percent is projected. But a further 
increase in unemployment by 400,000 is expected. At present, 
some 6 million people in Germany are without a private-sector 
job. 
  Despite this dramatic employment situation, there is no 
willingness in Bonn or Frankfurt to take effective measures to 
promote growth. The Bundestag Budget Committee saddled the 
federal finance minister's austerity budget with an additional 5 
billion German marks [DM] and, against this background of weak 
growth and poor employment prospects, the Bundesbank states that 
"at the moment and in the foreseeable future" it does not want a 
change in its policy of stability. So, must the 6 million 
people without a regular job resign themselves to their fate, 
and must many of the (still) employed continue to fear for their 
jobs? 
  This is not inevitable, economically. The economic and 
finance policy tools still contain possibilities to strengthen 
the presently hesitant economic growth in such a way that, in 
the medium term, a noticeable reduction in unemployment is also 
attainable. For that, only a few financing taboos must be 
broken, and the wage policy must be released from its role as 
scapegoat. 
  Depreciation relief, innovation and capital assistance are 
useful tools for improving economic development, but their 
application depends on the general economic and business 
climate. The means for promoting growth include one tool that 
always works: Strengthening and accelerating public investments 
which lead directly to an increase in orders in the construction 
industry, in machine and systems building, in measurement and 
control technology, and in building commercial vehicles. 
  There are plenty of projects to improve the infrastructure, 
the environment, and employment which must be carried out 
urgently: 

  -  Despite increasing congestion on the German 
autobahns, extension of rail traffic is progressing only slowly; 
the rolling stock and the rail network of the Reichsbahn [east 
German railway] in particular must urgently be modernized and 
enlarged--but at Deutsche Waggonbau AG (one of the few 
productive east German enterprises), only 7,000 of 25,000 jobs 
still exist. 
  -  The installation of equipment to reduce air and 
water pollution progresses slowly, and the clean-up of toxic 
soils is done predominantly through job-creation measures (which 
continuallay under go cuts)-- while, at the same time, 
production and personnel capacities in machine and systems 
building are under-utilized. 
  -  In united Germany there is a need 
for 2.5 million additional housing units, and in the new laender 
there is enormous demand for the rehabilitation of cities and 
housing--but in December 1993, almost 110,000 construction 
workers were unemployed. 
  These are measures, easily multiplied, which must be 
implemented in the coming years if environmental stress is to be 
reduced, the transportation grid is to be improved, and the 
creation of slums is to be averted. Faster tackling of these 
projects would not start an "economic flash in the pan," but 
rather would trigger employment-effective growth which would 
also strengthen smaller businesses via more effective 
infrastructure. The under-utilized production capacities and the 
reserve of unemployed workers would limit tendencies toward 
price increases. The question of financing remains difficult, 
but it is not unsolvable. Despite the frighteningly steep 
increase in public indebtedness in the past four years, united 
Germany was fifth from the bottom on the list of public debt 
ratios (in percentage of gross national product) among 19 OECD 
countries; public debt in the United States and in Japan 
(economically so admired here) was more than one-third higher. 
  The German capital market would be rich enough for 
additional 
credit financing of public investments, but the interest 
payments present great problems. These problems could be 
resolved through new regulations by the Federal Government and 
the Bundesbank: 

  -  The Bundesbank will transfer over DM18 
billion to its owner, the Federal Government. Of this amount, 
only DM7 billion are earmarked for the 1994 budget; the 
remaining DM11 billion are to be used for debt repayment. This 
stipulation from the 1980's is economically obsolete in 1993/94. 
In the deepest postwar recession, not yet overcome, the 
repayment of old debts is not a priority. [sentence as 
published] To use these funds to ease the interest burden of 
debt-financed investments and/or as investment subsidies to 
laender and communities would make more sense with regard to 
employment and stability. Only by reducing unemployment can one 
avert hindering future consolidation efforts because of 
diminshed revenues caused by the economic situation. One hundred 
thousand fewer unemployed bring a DM3.5 billion relief to public 
finances. 
  -  The Bundesbank should not have to balance its books 
according to the lowest cost principle because of regulations 
oriented toward protecting creditors. It has no creditors to be 
protected but, because of this regulation, it has accumulated 
"hidden reserves" in the amount of DM60 billion to DM70 billion. 
A gradual market evaluation would free up large amounts for 
investment financing, without any risks. 
  Alternative: Introduction of a time-limited levy on private 
capital assets, analogous to the 1949 levy on mortgages and 
profits from credits, raised to finance the "immediate 
assistance law." In economic terms, it would make better sense 
to stabilize the Bundesbank profits through appropriate use.

<F P=106> ["hen"-signed report: "DIHT: Recession in Germany Has Come </F>
to a Standstill"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce [DIHT] is confident that the recession in 
Germany has come to a standstill. However, economic development 
will pick up gradually, DIHT General Manager Franz Schoser said 
when he presented the traditional DIHT spring survey of 
approximately 25,000 enterprises. In his view, there is no 
reason to give the all-clear signal for economic development 
because orders on hand in the companies are still low, 
production capacities are being insufficiently utilized, and the 
profit situation is unsatisfactory. 
  For all of Germany, DIHT expects a growth of 0.5 percent at 
best. The DIHT spring survey has come to the conclusion that, 
for the first time in an extended period, there are slight 
trends of recovery in west German industry. This moderate 
confidence is primarily due to increasing exports. The 
resulting economic growth will, however, not be sufficient to 
bring the reduction of employment in western Germany to a halt 
by the end of 1994. 
  The current stagnation of economic development at a low 
level 
continues to reveal the processes of structural adjustment in 
western Germany, in Schoser's view. Efforts to improve 
competitiveness and the quality of Germany as an industrial 
location have shown some success; however, painfully achieved 
cost reductions are all too often counteracted by additional 
burdens imposed by the state. This is particularly due to the 
wave of local taxes and fees, which has recently been steadily 
swelling. In addition, economic development is hampered by the 
relatively low purchasing power, which affects, in particular, 
the trade and service sector. Regarding the development of 
employment, there is not yet any easing of tension to be seen at 
the moment, not to mention a change in the trend. The 
forthcoming wage contracts are currently playing a key role in 
all plans for personnel by the companies. 
  The investment climate, which has been rather frosty so far, 
has not yet warmed decisively, Schoser noted in Bonn. Positive 
corrections in the investment plans can be expected only if the 
revival of exports were to be stronger this year than expected. 
The current stimuli -- primarily from North and South America 
and from Southeast Asia -- are still too weak to act as an 
engine for the German economy, especially since demand from 
Germany's main export region, Europe, is weak. The assessment 
of the situation in eastern Germany, on the other hand, is 
generally more optimistic. The confidence dominating there is 
primarily based on a clear increase in orders received. 
According to DIHT's assessment, even quicker recovery of the 
east German companies is, however, still hindered by the 
excessively rising wage and ancillary wage costs, which are an 
oppressing burden. Many private companies also have an 
insufficient amount of capital. Even though investment 
activities will remain energetic in eastern Germany in 1994, 
especially in the construction sector, the marked investment 
dynamism of the initial period after German unification will 
abate slowly, because various large-scale investments have been 
concluded already. 
<H5>  Bright Spot for Exporters </H5>
  DIHT still sees tremendous administrative obstacles in the 
new laender for exploiting investment potential -- for instance, 
in purchasing and utilizing real estate property. DIHT expects 
a bright spot for the east German exporters, whose prospects on 
the world market are gradually improving. Their importance for 
the overall German economy, however, still remains small. The 
reduction of personnel will certainly come to a halt by the end 
of this year, the DIHT predicts.

<F P=106> [Olivier Pognon report: "China: Rene Monory on a Mission"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing -- "It has to be seen to be believed... It 
is by coming here that you understand." [French Senate Chairman] 
Rene Monory thinks that the French -- particularly their 
politicians -- are not sufficiently aware of what is happening 
in China and in the "little dragons." "The French political 
world is introspective," he remarked in the plane taking us to 
China. "You have to travel to gauge things. Politicians do not 
travel." 
  Gauging things... It is true that present-day China in 
ferment, where the Senate speaker has just spent a week, 
provides unsuspected prospects for the French who are facing 
economic stagnation -- or minimum expansion. China, whose GNP 
increased by 13 percent last year, has experienced a prodigious 
explosion in economic activity over the past 15 years, 
particularly in the "special economic areas." And this 
explosion is reflected on the ground in a prodigious growth in 
factories and skyscrapers. 
  The Senate speaker, China's official guest, was primarily 
tasked with a diplomatic mission: To contribute to the 
improvement in relations between France and China. And through 
that to work to ensure that the visit which Edouard Balladur 
makes to this country in early April takes place in the best 
possible conditions. 
  The conversations which Mr. Monory has had with his Chinese 
hosts suggest that the situation is being clarified, and that 
the prime minister's visit will be profitable. The Senate 
speaker was received in Beijing not only by Qiao Shi, speaker of 
the National People's Congress, but also by Premier Li Peng who 
gave a dinner in his honor, by Vice President Rong Yiren, and by 
the deputy foreign trade minister and the chairman of the 
equivalent of the CNPF [National Council of French Employers]. 
In a country where signs and symbols are extremely important 
and where custom dictates that a speaker of a foreign assembly 
is only received by his counterpart, this hospitality stands out. 
<H5>  Heady Pace of Expansion </H5>
  Li Peng said: "We hope that Mr. Balladur's visit will be a 
complete success," and Vice President Rong Yiren judged this 
forthcoming visit as "very important" for the development of 
relations between the two countries. "We are in favor of 
constantly promoting relations between the two countries," the 
Chinese vice president told the Senate speaker. "I hope that 
the period of uncertainty will be forgotten, and that we will 
return to the atmosphere of friendship which has reigned between 
us for 30 years," Mr. Monory replied. 
  Franco-Chinese relations had a close shave: The case of the 
contract for the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan is only slowly 
being accepted. Not one of the leaders with whom the Senate 
speaker met failed to stress the "problems" and "vicissitudes" 
which these relations have experienced over recent years. The 
Canton consulate general, opened in 1991, had to be closed the 
following year at the request of the Chinese, and the RATP 
[Independent Paris Transport System] lost the Canton subway deal. 
  However, the Chinese leaders wanted nothing more than to 
respond to the French desire to reopen dialogue, if only to 
diversify their partners, which, moreover, they like to see in 
competition with each other, and to benefit from our know-how. 
The rapprochement brought about at Mr. Balladur's initiative 
resulted in the communique jointly issued on 12 January in which 
France pledged in particular not to sell any more arms to 
Taiwan. It is in this atmosphere that the Senate speaker's 
visit was made, a few weeks after that of Alain Peyrefitte who 
was also tasked with strengthening ties. Mr. Monory had been 
invited a year ago by the National People's Congress. The visit 
had been postponed several times at the premier's request. To 
prevent the Senate speaker from being rebuffed and to ensure 
that his visit effectively formed part of the reconciliation 
started, the publication of the joint communique had to be 
awaited. 
  Mr. Monory vaunted the excellence of French technology in a 
number of spheres to the Chinese officials: transportation, the 
nuclear industry, aeronautics, and so forth. "We have the best 
high-speed train in the world," he said, for instance, to Qiao 
Chi between the sizzling beef and the soft turtle stew. 
According to him, the only way in which our country can return 
to growth is to find outlets for its industries in this region 
of the world in which a good part of the world's economic growth 
is concentrated. French enterprises -- for instance Mr. Monory 
visited the Peugeot factory -- are participating in Chinese 
development by joint ventures, which are often very effective 
but of which we have far fewer than the Germans. 
  The stages of his visit merely confirmed this idea in him. 
Shanghai, an urban jumble all blended together, in which slums 
doomed to disappear mingle with houses bearing the nostalgic 
charm of the former concessions, and brand new skyscrapers, and 
in which the municipality has undertaken to build in 10 years an 
area similar to but bigger than the Paris Defense area in the 
new Pudong district. Canton, then Shenzen, a city of 3 million 
inhabitants which has emerged from nowhere in about 10 years. 
Finally Hong Kong, a replica of Manhattan, which has no reason 
to envy its model, which is destined to rejoin China in three 
years' time while maintaining its economic status. The Senate 
speaker is a little more enthusiastic than the Chinese 
themselves about their future: "How long do you think you will 
need to catch up with us? Will it take 15 years, 20 years?" he 
asked Qiao Shi. "A century," the chairman of the People's 
Congress replied. But for a Chinese that is a relatively short 
prospect given the scale of China's history.

  [Text] Paris, 2 Mar -- Problems of Polish-French defense 
and military cooperation, the situation in Europe, especially in 
the former Yugoslavia and Russia, and Poland's place in a 
European security system were the subjects discussed by Admiral 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Francois Leotard, defense ministers of 
Poland and France, during their Wednesday [2 March] meeting in 
Paris. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk is on an official three-day visit to 
France. On Thursday he is to take part in a trilateral meeting 
of the French, Polish, and German defense ministers. [Words 
indistinct] Leotard and Kolodziejczyk, Volker Ruehe will also be 
taking part. 
  Military cooperation with France is very highly appraised by 
the Polish side, as Minister Kolodziejczyk pointed out at a news 
conference after his meeting with Minister Leotard. He 
especially highlighted its technical aspects -- assistance by 
French industry in modernizing Polish army weapons and adapting 
them to West European standards. Without French assistance, the 
Polish minister said, adapting our defense structures to the 
level of Western Europe would have been incredibly difficult. 
  Kolodziejczyk also drew attention to France's role in 
speeding up actions aimed at integrating Poland into a European 
security system. In connection with the envisaged granting to 
Poland of associate member status of the Western European Union 
[WEU] (a decision is to be reached at the WEU Ministerial 
Council on 9 and 10 May this year), he expressed the view that 
at present this was the greatest opportunity for such 
integration and at the same time a way of getting into a 
European security system. According to Kolodziejczyk, Poland's 
future full WEU membership could overtake the economic 
integration with the European Community. 
  According to sources close to the French Defense Ministry, 
France wants Poland's actual association with the WEU to take 
place as early as possible. At a news conference on Wednesday 
Leotard recalled that it was the position of France and Germany 
which speeded up the process of bringing Poland closer to the 
WEU. At the same time he emphasized that WEU associate status 
is a transitory stage, leading to full membership in that 
military organization. 
  During the talks between Kolodziejczyk and Leotard the issue 
of Poland's possible participation in the European Corps in 
Strasbourg was also raised. The Polish minister expressed his 
belief that such a solution is possible and necessary. 
Leotard, who regards this issue as complicated, believes that 
the first step could be the presence of Polish observers at the 
corps. 
  This subject will be discussed, among others, during the 
Thursday meeting of the Polish, French, and German defense 
ministers. Leotard said it would be desirable to hold such 
meetings regularly, every year, and for trilateral cooperation 
in the field of defense to supplement political cooperation, an 
expression of which are the regular trilateral consultations 
among these countries' foreign affairs ministers which have now 
been taking place for two and a half years. 
  The heads of the Polish and French Defense Departments also 
talked about joint maneuvers by the two countries' armies. It 
was reported that maneuvers with the participation of French 
Alpine riflemen will take place this June in southern Poland. 
Also this year there will be joint maneuvers by the Polish and 
French Navies in the Baltic. This will be the first joint 
exercises by units of the two armies since the end of the Second 
World War. They will also be the first in which French units 
will participate together with units from a central European 
country. Specific details of these intentions will be discussed 
during the coming visit (9-12 March) to Poland by Admiral 
Jacques Laxande, the chief of the General Staff of the French 
Armed Forces. He will visit Warsaw, Poznan, and the triple city 
[Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot].

<F P=106> [Patrice De Beer report: "Lao Foreign Minister `Delighted' </F>
With His Visit To France"] 
  [Text] In office for just one year, Somsavad Lengsavath 
concluded -- on Monday, 28 February -- the first official visit 
to France by a Lao foreign minister since the "kingdom of the 
million elephants" was overthrown by the Communist Pathet Lao on 
2 December 1975. Received by the president of the republic and 
Alain Juppe's lunch guest on Monday, he left "delighted" with 
the reception given in his honor. Nevertheless, France attaches 
much more importance to the other "Indochinese" countries: 
Cambodia and Vietnam. The planned budget for cooperation with 
Laos in 1994 is 70 million French francs. 
  "My visit did not lead to the signing of any agreements, but 
it was crucially important, since Messrs. Mitterrand and Juppe 
reaffirmed their interest in strengthening the friendship and 
cooperation with Laos," Mr. Somsavad said to LE MONDE. There 
were also discussions about the dam on the Nam Theune, the water 
supply to the province of Vientiane, and telecommunications 
(Alcatel). While human rights -- a matter on which Roland Dumas 
had asked Laos to "make an effort" during his 1991 visit -- were 
mentioned only briefly, the same was not true regarding the 
country's French- speaking status. 
  In response to Mr. Juppe, who feels that "Laos, Cambodia, 
and 
Vietnam all belong to the French-speaking family," and that "the 
development of friendship and cooperation with this country can 
be a staging post for France's ambitions, values, and specific 
characteristics in Asia," Mr. Somsavad told us: "French is 
still an important language used at the United Nations and in 
international relations. In Laos, it still has an important 
role." Nevertheless, the prime minister had forgotten the French 
he learned at school 30 years ago. 
  He also mentioned Laos' relations with its neighbors. He 
sees his country as the crossroads of Burma, China, Thailand, 
and Vietnam. The bridge crossing the Mekong near Vientiane, 
which is to be opened in April in the presence of King Bhumibol 
of Thailand, should reinforce relations with Bangkok, which 
still has problems with a border dispute, the asylum granted to 
"certain bad elements who use Thai territory to undertake 
activities harmful to us," and massive smuggling. 
  Mr. Somsavad attempted to play down links with Vietnam -- 
the 
"big brother" and political example of one of the last Communist 
countries. "We have shared the same destiny in the past, and we 
have fought together against oppression and foreign invasion. 
Over these years, we have built a very strong friendship, links 
which are completely normal and legitimate. (...) We have 
heard a great many stories about the influence Vietnam would 
enjoy in Laos. All that is unfounded." He also said: "The 
leading investor in Laos is Thailand, and nobody can claim that 
Vietnam could have dominant importance in our country if it is 
not the leading investor."

  [Text] Toulon, France, March 3 (AFP) -- A French nuclear 
attack submarine hit the seabed and dented its hull near Cap 
Ferrat in the Mediterranean, the Navy said on Thursday [3 
March]. The Amethyst mini-submarine hit the seabed at low speed 
during a training dive on Wednesday and dented a protective dome 
for its sonar in the bows, the Navy said. 
  The Amethyst, at 73.6 metres (225 feet), is one of the 
smallest nuclear submarines in the world. It is armed with 14 
SM39 missiles or wire-guided torpedoes. It was the second 
incident involving a French Navy nuclear submarine in less than 
a year. On August 18, the submarine Rubis rammed the tanker 
Lyria as it surfaced, gashing its hull and causing an oil slick. 
The captain was relieved of his command.

  [Text] Madrid, 1 Mar (EFE) -- On the second day of his 
state visit to Spain, Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem 
stated on 1 March that his government "will do its utmost" so 
Aerolineas Argentinas can reach a speedy settlement with the 
Spanish carrier Iberia. 
  During a news conference at El Pardo Palace, the Argentine 
head of state stated that negotiations with Iberia are not on 
his agenda of talks with the Spanish head of government, Felipe 
Gonzalez. He said nonetheless that he hoped both delegations' 
experts "make their calculations again and work out an 
agreement" in the forthcoming days. 
  In the meantime, Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
on 28 February in Buenos Aires that negotiations between Iberia 
and the Argentine Government geared to overcoming Aerolineas 
Argentinas' financial crisis have been suspended after a 
decision by the Spanish company. 
  Commenting on another subject, Menem on 1 March announced 
that Argentina might join NAFTA in June. 
  The Argentine president was full of optimism that his 
country, together with Colombia and Chile, will be able to join 
NAFTA -- established between Canada, the United States, and 
Mexico -- without having to sever its current commitments with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  "It is a question of making room for both agreements. It 
goes without saying that if this is achieved Argentina will 
stand to gain a lot," he said, adding that his country endorses 
the U.S. project to create a free trade zone from Alaska to 
Tierra del Fuego. 
  Menem was proud of his administration's economic 
achievements, noting that his privatization policy was 
instrumental in curbing inflation -- which in 1989-1990 ran at 
approximately 22,000 percent -- to an estimated 4.5 percent this 
year. 
  Menem believes the success of his economic policy "has no 
secret. Markets have been totally liberated and an all-out 
campaign against the fiscal deficit has been waged. We had to 
perform major surgery without giving a general anesthetic and we 
have obtained exceptional results. Argentina is at present the 
country with the highest growth rate in the world following the 
PRC and Thailand." 
  Menem noted: "It is all very well to say so, but it is quite 
difficult to do it." He observed that the state's action has 
been limited to "only the fields of justice, sanitation, 
education, and security; the rest has been entrusted to the 
private sector." 
  He added: "This privatization formula together with a dose 
of wit and wisdom and a bit of luck have enabled us to turn 
deficit-ridden state-owned enterprises like the telephone and 
petroleum ones into profitable companies that pay taxes." 
  To this effect he remarked that Spanish entrepreneurs who 
followed Gonzalez' advice concerning investments [in Argentina] 
"are getting great results." He praised "the excellent" 
bilateral relations between both countries. 
  Menem skirted the issue of his ideological and personal 
preference for either the head of government, Felipe Gonzalez, 
or Jose Maria Aznar, the president of the leading opposition 
party, the Popular Party, whom he met at El Pardo Palace on 1 
March. 
  "They are both friends of mine," he commented. "It is 
important not to tie oneself down to ideological considerations 
but rather to assess results, and both of them are contributing 
greatly to democracy and freedom." 
  Menem added that the difference between Gonzalez and Aznar 
"lies in the fact that Gonzalez is heading the government and 
Aznar has not yet had the opportunity to do so. And I can tell 
you from experience that it is one thing to engage in politics 
from this side of the counter and a very different thing to do 
so from the outside." 
  He underlined the role his country is playing in the 
international scene, noting that an Argentine contingent of 
1,350 men is currently part of the UN peacekeeping forces -- of 
whom 1,078 are in Bosnia and the rest in Cyprus and Kuwait -- 
and is "ready to pay heed to UN requirements." 
  Regarding possible mediation between the United States and 
Cuba, Menem said: "I have never offered myself as a mediator so 
democracy may be re-established in Cuba, but I do share the 
Ibero-American hope that Castro will accept democratic rule and 
Cubans can soon elect their rulers." 
  Menem accepted the press' meddling in his private life with 
resignation. "I cannot prevent it. They have the freedom to 
say what is true and what is not. I assumed office having a 
specific personal situation and my people know me and elected me 
just as I am." 
  The Argentine president may run for the presidency a second 
time if the constitutional reform -- which was the outcome of a 
"very fruitful" dialogue and agreement with the Radical Civic 
Union's Raul Alfonsin -- is passed. He said: "If I do my 
homework well I may be elected. Otherwise, let them elect 
someone else who does better than I."

  [Text] Now that he has concluded his official visit to 
Madrid the Argentine President Carlos Menem this afternoon 
begins a private visit in Santiago de Compostela in northwest 
Spain. Carlos Menem will also visit Catalonia. 
  This morning President Menem attended a breakfast at the 
headquarters of the Spanish Confederation of Business 
Organizations with Spanish employers and presidents of Spanish 
banks and large companies. 
  During the breakfast he urged the Spanish businessmen to 
continue to have confidence in Argentina and invited them to 
invest in his country. 
  Carlos Menem stressed the important political transformation 
of his country during the past few years, in particular 
concerning economic policy, which has enabled Argentina to 
reduce inflation from 22,000 [as heard] percent in 1990 to 7.4 
percent last year.

journalists. Tomorrow the judge will decide if the case is to 
be referred to the National High Court. 
  [Correspondent Angeles Bandres] This was the moment this 
afternoon when the three Algerian policemen were taken to 
Fontcalent prison in Alicante. They were taken there after 
making statements to the judge in which they denied any link 
with the fundamentalist group FIS. 
  [Judge Juan Francisco Vives] No, no, no. They completely 
deny 
belonging to the FIS. There is nothing to indicate that they 
are, and they consistently deny it. 
  [Bandres] However, this morning one of them told a number of 
journalists that they belonged to the Islamic Salvation Front. 
  [Unidentified journalist] Do you belong to any political 
group? 
  [Unidentified man] To the FIS, the FIS, but we are also 
Muslims. 
  [Bandres] According to the judge, the detainees could be 
accused of seizing an aircraft, but not terrorism, because they 
were not acting as an armed group.

<F P=106> [Carmen del Riego report: "People's Party Asks Gonzalez To </F>
Summon Parties To Discuss Autonomy Problem"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- People's Party Deputy Secretary 
General Mariano Rajoy yesterday urged the prime minister to 
immediately summon all the political forces in order to tackle 
the problem of the implementation of autonomy, taking as a basis 
the document presented in Barcelona by Aznar, because, he said, 
"the government must not evade its responsibilities." 
  Rajoy justified presenting this initiative on the ground 
that 
"a definition of the model of autonomy is necessary" in view of 
the host of topics for debate, which require concluding a new 
national agreement similar to the constitutional agreement. 
  The People's Party leader -- who presented the proposal 
together with Secretary for the Autonomy Area Jorge Fernandez -- 
was very critical of the government's attitude in this issue, 
"in which it must not be a bystander as it is," since the 
silence "has not only been that of the minister of public 
administration but also that of the prime minister himself." In 
Rajoy's opinion, the People's Party proposal is important enough 
"for it not to be dismissed by saying that it is simplistic." 
The People's Party deputy secretary general emphasized that his 
party's proposal gives the government an opportunity to tackle 
the problem "with all the calm that it deems appropriate, but 
with proper seriousness, because the only thing that is no 
solution is to do nothing, as the government is doing." 
  With respect to the standardization of powers among the 
autonomous communities, he stated that this does not mean that 
they must all compulsorily assume all the powers defined as 
transferable if they do not want them, but that they have the 
opportunity to attain them. The People's Party is opposed to 
"preferential political treatment" for certain communities, 
"because the treatment can only be that resulting from the 
existence of a distinctive feature which we acknowledge, but 
that must entail not different but distinctive treatment." 
  In Rajoy's opinion, the phrase "cafe for everybody" is often 
disparaged, "without taking into account the fact that the cafe 
can take many forms, but what is not possible is to be left 
without a cafe." With respect to the possibility of these 
matters being tackled bilaterally between the central government 
and each autonomous community, the People's Party deputy 
secretary general stated that the pact should be between the 
parties represented in parliament, "which are the ones 
representing national sovereignty," and which include the 
nationalist parties governing autonomous communities, but the 
bilateral relationship, which will also have to be present in 
the negotiations for the agreement, "should be conducted within 
the framework of the model of the state laid down by the Cortes." 
  The differences between the Spanish Socialist Workers Party 
and the People's Party became clear in many other issues 
yesterday, with accusations and aspersions which conflict with 
the atmosphere of understanding which has recently existed 
between the two parties. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Today the parliament adopted one of its most 
sensitive decisions in recent years. It lifted the immunity of 
four deputies--three from the DEP [Democracy Party] and one 
independent. The immunity of the following deputies has been 
lifted: DEP leader Hatip Dicle, Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan, Mus 
Deputy Sirri Sakik, and Sirnak independent Deputy Mahmut Alinak. 
  Following the speedy decision, DEP leader Hatip Dicle and 
Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan were detained by police at the door to 
parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Following the detention of the two deputies who had been 
stripped of their immunity, the police issued an alert 
preventing all the deputies who are under investigation from 
going abroad. Restrictions were imposed to prevent the deputies 
from going abroad. 
  Nusret Demiral, chief public prosecutor of Ankara State 
Security Court, said that death penalty will be asked for the 
detained deputies. Nusret Demiral indicated that the case 
against the deputies, who have had their immunity lifted and 
been placed under arrest, will be conducted in accordance with 
Article 125, which deals with treason and crimes against the 
sovereignty of the state and which entails capital punishment. 
Demiral also said that all the deputies whose immunity has been 
lifted will be called to the State Security Court to testify. 
[passage omitted] 
  DEP deputies will take recourse to the Constitutional Court 
to challenge parliament's decision to lift their immunity. 
Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan said that their immunity was lifted 
on the basis of concocted police reports. Therefore, he said, 
they will go to the Constitutional Court and ask for the 
nullification of the decision. 
  Article 85 of the Constitution requires the Constitutional 
Court to reply within 15 days to the deputies' appeal for the 
abrogation of the lifting of immunity. 
  What are the charges against the deputies, the files on whom 
were speedily taken up and processed at parliament after years 
of procrastination? 
  Here are the charges found in the files on eight deputies: 
  Hatip Dicel, leader of DEP: Dicle, who drew attention on 
himself when he described the martyred noncommissioned officers 
in the Tuzla massacre as military targets, is being charged with 
treason to the country for his various speeches and for engaging 
in activities aimed at undermining the unity of the state. 
  Orhan Dogan, Sirnak deputy: He is being charged for wanting 
to place all or part of the state's territory under the 
suzerainty of a foreign state, due to comments in speeches he 
made before being elected deputy and during the oath-taking 
ceremony at the Turkish parliament. 
  Sirri Sakik, deputy from Mus: He is being charged with 
treason and for activities aimed at undermining the state's 
unity. 
  Mahmut Alinak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with 
making speeches aimed at undermining the Turkish Republic's 
unity. Alinak says that accusations leveled against him arise 
simply from the fact that he used the term "the Kurdish people." 
  Leyla Zana, deputy from Diyarbakir: She is being charged 
with advocating the establishment of an independent Kurdish 
state in eastern and southeastern Anatolia. Zana is known for 
her anti-Turkey statements made abroad. 
  Selim Sadak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with 
engaging in separatism resulting from a speech he made at a 
rally in Izmit on 27 September 1992 and his parliamentary motion 
on 18 August 1992 on the Sirnak incidents. In his speech in 
Izmit, he said that the Sirnak incidents were organized by the 
state and he spoke about the Kurdish People. 
  Ahmet Turk, deputy from Mardin: He is charged with engaging 
in separatist propaganda due to two speeches and one article he 
wrote. During his 1993 trip to the Unites States, Turk made 
statements about a cease-fire declaration in the southeast. 
During the 23 April parliament session he proposed that Kurdish 
children too should have holiday celebrations in their own 
language. 
  Hasan Mezarci, deputy from Istanbul: He is being charged for 
opposing the laws on crimes against Ataturk. [passage omitted] 
  While you were watching this footage, we received the 
following last minute report: Mehmet Agir, general director of 
the Security Directorate, has said that the deputies whose 
immunity has been lifted will be placed in custody successively. 
Mehmet Agir replied to Channel 6 reporter Ful Ekasan's 
questions on the phone. Agir said that Hatip Dicle and Orhan 
Dogan, who were placed in custody as the start of this detention 
process, have been taken to Ankara Security Directorate and will 
be kept in custody tonight. Indicating that the other deputies 
who stand to lose their immunity will be placed in custody one 
after another, Mehmet Agir said that their interrogation will 
begin as of tomorrow. Agir added that after interrogation, the 
deputies will be referred to the state security court.

  [Excerpts] Regarding claims that Russia has been 
dispatching units to establish security zones in Azerbaijan, 
Turkey has stated that should peace forces be required in 
Azerbaijan, it should be done within the framework of the CSCE 
principles which stipulate that these units be multinational. 
  Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman, at his 
weekly news conference, indicated that there was no information 
regarding Russian soldiers being sent to Azerbaijan, adding that 
the sending of peace forces to the CSCE countries was determined 
at the CSCE Council of Ministers meeting in Rome. [passage 
omitted] 
  Ataman further stated that they received reports regarding a 
ceasefire in Azerbaijan but that it was not comprehensive and 
recalled that Turkey stressed that the ceasefire, on its own, is 
not sufficient to solve the issue. 
  Ataman concluded by saying that the ceasefire will be 
significant only if the Armenians withdraw from the territories 
they occupy and enable the refugees to return.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 2 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry officials 
said on Wednesday [2 March] that they have not received any 
information from Russia concerning a meeting in Moscow of the 
supporters of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan], the separatist 
terrorist organization. 
  Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told a 
weekly 
news conference that the Ministry asked for information on the 
issue. "However, Russia has yet to inform us on the meeting," 
Ataman said. Ataman said Foreign Ministry official Bilgin Unan, 
who is currently in Russia for official talks, could bring the 
issue up. 
  A conference was held in Moscow last month by a number of 
organizations which are believed to have ties with the 
separatist terrorist organization. Russian Minister Valerie 
Samsurov [name and title as received] was in attendance at the 
Moscow meeting of the PKK supporters. 
  Russian Ambassador to Turkey Albert Chernyshev was summoned 
to the Foreign Ministry and was asked to inquire about the 
meeting. He assured Foreign Ministry officials that there has 
been no change in his country's policy. 
  Ataman said a delegation from the Foreign Ministry arrived 
in 
Moscow on Tuesday to discuss relations between Turkey and Russia.

  [Excerpt] Ankara, Mar. 2 (A.A.) -- Macedonian Deputy Prime 
Minister Jovan Andonov is currently in Turkey to seek Turkish 
support after a Greek-imposed blockade. "We sincerely believe 
that Turkey will help us," Andonov said. 
  Veysel Atasoy, energy and natural resources minister, said 
before meeting with Andonov that Turkey was one of the first 
countries to recognize Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM] independence. 
  Andonov said Macedonia's northern borders and its southern 
Greek border have been besieged and the north-south route was 
the only way for the procurement of raw materials and for 
exportation. Turkey earlier said the Balkan republic could use 
Turkish ports to circumvent a trade blockade imposed by Greece.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 2 (A.A.) -- Turkey said on Wednesday 
[2 March] that it supported the continuation of the Middle East 
peace talks. Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman 
told a press conference that the massacre of 63 Palestinians in 
Hebron's Ibrahim Mosque by a fanatic Jewish settler should not 
hinder the peace process. Ataman said such "regrettable" 
incidents showed that the peace process was still in a sensitive 
and critical point. 
  Ataman recalled that Israel proposed several measures to 
prevent such incidents from happening again, however the 
Palestinian people found them inadequate. 
  After the incident President Suleyman Demirel called 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat [title as received] and 
expressed his condolences over the massacre saying, "I am 
shocked to hear the news regarding the brutal attack perpetrated 
against innocent Palestinians praying in the Mosque." Demirel 
also said Turkey was ready to do its utmost if help is demanded 
to further the Middle East peace process.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" column by Yalcin Ozer: "Russian Domination in </F>
the Balkans"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A new era has begun in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the aftermath of the NATO ultimatum. This 
period is chiefly characterized by the fact that the United 
States has abandoned the region to Russia's influence. Russia 
has taken the most important step in reestablishing political 
domination in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as in the Balkans. As 
we all know well, this domination is based on the foundation of 
the "Orthodox Alliance". 
  Everyone must now realize that an extremely painful and 
difficult period has begun for the Balkans. A large number of 
Turks and Muslims in the region are gradually being dragged into 
a dreadful predicament. The besieged Sandzak, Kosovo, and 
Montenegro, as well as Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM], on which Greece has imposed an embargo. 
In the near future, Albania, the Turkish presence in Bulgaria, 
Western Thrace, and the Turkish and Muslim minorities in other 
Balkan areas will join these areas. 
  All these people are threatened with extinction within the 
framework of the Orthodox-Crusader political plan drawn by 
Russia. 
  This situation paints a picture of desperation, in which the 
tyranny in Bosnia-Herzegovina will soon become a mere detail. 
In the coming months, ethnic cleansing policies will be 
implemented one by one and mass deaths, famine, and refugee 
movements will be observed in this region. Most of the refugees 
will move to Turkey. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos and 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou, who returned to 
Athens from Brussels at noon today, described the European press 
attacks on the Greek [European Union--EU] presidency as unfair. 
Mr. Pangalos stressed that intensive efforts and prudence are 
needed during the process of accepting three new partners into 
the EU, and added that his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel had 
contributed considerably to these efforts. Our correspondent 
Mirela Kalostipi has the following report. 
  [Kalostipi] Mr. Pangalos and Mr. Papandreou returned from 
Brussels with harsh reproaches for the European press for its 
systematic attacks on the Greek presidency. The alternate 
foreign minister and the deputy foreign minister, who 
successfully concluded the marathon meeting of the Ministerial 
Council on the expansion of the EU, expressed great unhappiness 
with press reports that undermine the Greek presidency's 
efforts. However, Mr. Pangalos expressed gratitude for the 
support of German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, who--contrary 
to the UK, French, and Spanish foreign ministers--has 
contributed substantially to the presidency's efforts. Mr. 
Pangalos said: Intensive efforts and prudence were needed. The 
negotiations have been concluded with three of the four 
countries--that is, Sweden, Finland, and Austria. By 1 January 
1995 they will participate in various EU bodies by sending 
ministers as observers and they will also participate in the EU 
Council meeting to be held in Corfu. 
  The alternate foreign minister particularly referred to 
Cyprus, saying that it should have already been included as a 
candidate country if former Prime Minister Konstandinos 
Mitsotakis had taken care of this in time at the European 
meeting in Edinburgh. In any case, Greece will see that the 
process for Cyprus' accession is speeded up--that is, earlier 
than 1 January 1995. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou described the 
European press attacks as unfair, but added that key elements of 
the EU recognize Greece's efforts. 
  Responding to a question on an initiative by the EU 
Commission president on the Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia] problem, Mr. Pangalos made it clear that yesterday 
he conveyed the prime minister's letter officially. He said Mr. 
Jacques Delors is following the issue carefully. Referring to 
Greece's legal arguments on the measures against Skopje, Mr. 
Pangalos described them as sound.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Yerasimos Artemis today 
gave the appraisal that, following the incident of the aircraft 
downing in Bosnia, the situation has been defused. He also 
stressed the role of the peace forces in promoting a political 
solution to the issue. 
  Responding to a question from correspondents, Mr. Arsenis 
stressed that the National Defense Ministry is in a state of 
heightened alertness and there is no reason for concern. 
However, the national defense minister did not rule out 
incidents and explosions in the Balkans since, as he put it, the 
peace process will take time. 
  Commenting on the way in which NATO acted, Mr. Arsenis 
expressed the view that the process of decision-making within 
the organization's framework must be discussed at the spring 
meeting of the defense ministers.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolaos Kiaos] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's decision to 
place sanctions on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] has somewhat postponed deliberations within 
the government and PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] on the 
various groups' gathering forces for PASOK's congress. These 
deliberations have been going on for some time now. 
  Government and party officials view this congress as the one 
preceding the succession of Papandreou and see it as an 
important one for the future direction of PASOK. A crucial 
factor in developments is the health of National Economy and 
Finance Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas, who has apparently been 
forced to withdraw from the contest. A large gap has apparently 
been created, because he was considered the favorite in the 
contest to succeed Papandreou. 
  Yennimatas' health gave an opportunity to other "hopefuls" 
for this position within the government to assert their views 
and policies on the current economic policy and, thus, 
automatically appear as possible successors. 
  Some of the names mentioned include Alternate National 
Economy Minister Ioannis Papandoniou and PASOK Deputy Ioannis 
Pottakis. However, only Commerce and Industry Minister 
Konstandinos Simitis can be considered to be politically close 
to Yennimatas; he is probably excluded because he does not want 
to move to Sindagma Square [government headquarters]. 
  PASOK officials' interests are centered on the congress. 
Through their moves, which began some time ago, they seek to 
gain favor with party organizations and, if possible, gain 
friendly delegates at the congress. 
  Reports note that Interior Minister Akis Tzokhatzopoulos, 
who 
is secretary of PASOK's Central Committee, has had, until now, 
sufficient support and access to all organizations. 
  National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis is far behind 
and 
does not have access to all organizations. Furthermore, his 
past also works against him because he was once removed from 
PASOK. 
  A decisive role in developments will be played by the many 
people closely associated to Yennimatas. Their interest, of 
course, is centered on the alliances that will be formed before 
the congress. 
  Konstandinos Laliotis; environment, town planning, and 
public 
works minister; does not appear to have any such aspirations. 
It should also be noted that he frequently differs with 
Tzokhatzopoulos on issues such as public works and flood 
prevention. 
  As things stand right now, it is estimated that the contest 
will be between Tzokhatzopoulos and Simitis. 
  Anyway, the road is still long and the stance of Papandreou, 
who controls the time when succession will be discussed, will 
certainly be decisive. 
  It is a well-known secret that from Maximos Palace, 
Papandreou looks at the presidential palace next door with 
interest. The distance, anyway, is small....

  [Text] The European Union [EU] Commission decided tonight 
to postpone adopting any decision against Greece for the 
measures the latter took against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Our Brussels correspondent 
Nikolaos Belos has the following dispatch. 
  [Begin Belos recording] The EU Commission will not take 
Greece to the European Court for its measures against Skopje 
before the conclusion of mediation efforts by Commissioner Hans 
Van Den Broek. This decision was made after a long debate at 
today's meeting of the EU Commission, during which political 
issues prevailed over legal and trade issues. 
  According to a statement by the spokesman of Commission 
President Jacques Delors, all aspects of the issue--political, 
legal, and trade--were discussed during the debate. The 
spokesman said: It was decided to continue the mediation 
efforts of Van Den Broek, who will discuss the issue with 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias tomorrow in Israel. 
Responding to a question, the spokesman also stressed that Van 
Den Broek does not plan any meetings with the Skopjeans for the 
time being. In conclusion, the spokesman emphasized that until 
Wednesday, when the issue will be discussed again at a 
Commission meeting, the commissioners authorized Commission 
President Jacques Delors and Van Den Broek to make the necessary 
decision on how to handle the issue. 
  The debate on the legal and trade aspects of the Greek 
measures was conducted on the basis of an opinion by the 
Commission's Legal Department given to the commissioners. 
According to reports, the Legal Department reported that it can 
justify a court case against Greece. 
  In his intervention during the discussion, Greek 
Commissioner 
Ioannis Palaiokrassas referred to the historic aspects of the 
issue and to continuous Skopjean provocations against Greece. 
  Finally, it has been learned that Greece's measures against 
Skopje will be discussed in Brussels on Monday during the EU 
foreign ministers meeting. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Wio Joustra and Eddo Rosenthal: "Lubbers Offers </F>
Rabin His `Good Offices' After Hebron Bloodbath"] 
  [Excerpts] Last Saturday [26 February] Prime Minister 
Lubbers extended his condolences about the bloodbath in Hebron 
to his Israeli counterpart Rabin by telephone. Lubbers also 
expressed his concern about the future of the peace process in 
the Middle East. 
  A government information service spokesman said Lubbers had 
offered Rabin "his good offices." But, up to now, no use has 
been made of them by the Israeli Government. The timing of 
Lubbers's gesture, which was made public by Rabin himself on 
Wednesday, caused some surprise in Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  For observers in The Hague it comes as no surprise that 
Lubbers has shown himself ready to play a more influential role 
in the peace process. PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat had called for 
this as early as October last year. 'Arafat repeated his call 
for a mediating role for Lubbers during his first official visit 
to the Netherlands in December last year and again when he came 
to The Hague to meet Nelson Mandela last month. 
  In his contacts with The Hague 'Arafat has always shown he 
is 
not just interested in trade and aid relations with the 
Netherlands. The PLO leader also sees a political role for the 
Netherlands as a traditional ally to Israel. 
  He realizes that, thanks to the emotional Netherlands links 
with Israel, Lubbers can make his influence count both in 
Jerusalem and in the European Union. On Wednesday in Jerusalem 
Rabin's spokesman said that an exceptionally good understanding 
had arisen between Lubbers and Rabin since the Israeli prime 
minister's visit to the Netherlands last June.

  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, one of the leaders behind the 
fundamentalist groups in Denmark, instigates acts of terrorism 
-- including those against Danish firms and Danish tourists in 
Egypt -- from his home in the Copenhagen area. 
  He is under sentence of death for his part in the 
assassination of Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981. The 
Egyptian state has requested his extradition from Denmark, but 
Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim has been granted political asylum in Denmark 
and, therefore, cannot be handed over to Egypt. 
  "Kill the infidels and join the fight for an Islamic state 
in 
Egypt," Islamic fundamentalists urge in mosques throughout 
Denmark. 
  For Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim and the other fundamentalists the 
purpose of the terrorism is to create economic chaos and social 
unrest in Egypt, so as to overturn President Mubarak's moderate 
government. 
  "The radical Islamic fundamentalists are dangerous, and can 
easily plan and carry out acts of terrorism from Europe," one 
Islamic expert predicts. 
  But the Danish asylum authorities have no opportunity to 
assess whether or not those seeking asylum are members of 
international terrorist organizations. The asylum authorities 
may not check the identity of those seeking asylum with Interpol 
or with the police in their country of origin. 
  In Egypt, Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is considered one of the 
leaders of the extremist Islamic groups which, with their bases 
outside the country, attempt to overthrow the Egyptian 
Government and set up an Islamic state. He himself does not 
hide his links with Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, one of the most 
violent and fundamentalist Islamic groups in Egypt. 
  The left-wing Egyptian newspaper AL-AHALI recently published 
an interview with Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, in which he made threats 
against foreign tourists and investments in Egypt, including 
Danish firms such as A.P. Moeller, F.L. Smidth, and Aarhus 
Flydedok, which operate in Egypt, and the 2,000 or so Danish 
tourists who holiday there each year. 
  "Tourism is a non-Islamic source of income which helps keep 
the present government in power, and foreigners have been warned 
to stay away from Egypt," Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim told the Egyptian 
paper. 
  "The radical Muslim leaders such as Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim 
living in various places in Europe and the United States pose a 
very real threat to their countries. It is easy for them to 
send orders for actions, money, or tapes with religious 
propaganda to members of the fanatical groups in Egypt, for 
example," POLITIKEN was told by Hesham Mubarak, a lawyer 
currently writing a book on radical Islamic groups and their 
international networks. 
  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim is a well-known figure in fundamentalist 
circles. In 1981 he was arrested as a leader of the banned 
fanatical group Jihad (Holy War), which later that year was tied 
to the assassination of President Anwar al-Sadat. In 1989 he 
escaped while being moved with other prisoners. Traveling 
through the Sudan and Peshawar in Pakistan, he reached 
Afghanistan where, like Sheik 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, thought to 
be the brains behind the World Trade Center bombing, he became 
one of the leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist volunteers 
aiding the Afghan Mojahidin in fighting the occupying Soviet 
power. 
  The Egyptian authorities have requested that Denmark hand 
over Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, but he need not fear ending his days 
on Egypt's gallows. 
  "People who have obtained asylum in Denmark are not returned 
to their own country if there is a death sentence awaiting 
them," Justice Minister Erling Olsen said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Gerhard </F>
Seifried on 2 March; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Seifried] Do you see yourself as the hero of 
Brussels? 
  [Kinkel] For God's sake, no. I did what was necessary and 
right. I am a convinced European. It was absolutely clear that 
we wanted the conclusion of the negotiations with the four EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association] countries, which is why I made 
a great effort and was able to make my contribution. 
  [Seifried] Still, it has been said that you played a crucial 
role. Reports said that you took off your jacket and rushed 
along hallways in shirtsleeves when the negotiations were on the 
brink of failure. 
  [Kinkel] That is true. After very long hours of 
negotiations, we had reached a stalemate yesterday morning and 
it looked as if the talks were going to be suspended without 
result. So it may be true that I can claim that I held the 
talks together at that moment and pointed out to my colleagues 
that, in the interest of Europe, we could not tolerate such a 
situation. And at such a moment, the word that comes from a 
larger country is probably of some significance, and, as we can 
see now, things worked out all right. 
  [Seifried] Nevertheless, some criticism has come from the 
ranks of the European Union [EU], and people claimed that you 
made too many concessions to the membership applicants. Is 
there a fear of a greater German bloc, maybe? Do you see such 
fears? 
  [Kinkel] No, I do not see that. Do not forget, with 80 
million people, Germany is now the largest country in the EU, 
which means that we bear special responsibility. We have in no 
way tried to push to the fore. We tried to be good mediators, 
which we could do. Nevertheless, we always made it quite clear, 
and that is what I said when I arrived in Brussels: We will not 
exclude any country, and certainly not Austria, but will try 
hard to achieve a positive result -- in the spirit of the 
Edinburgh resolutions. Actually, I thought that all that was 
quite normal. I have participated in heated sessions in 
Brussels before. Afterwards, one has to say: [word indistinct] 
what counts is the result -- and that does not look too bad for 
Austria. 
  [Seifried] Why is Germany, of all countries, pressing so 
hard for this enlargement? 
  [Kinkel] It is obvious. We are of the opinion that the EU 
has to be a well-balanced organism. We have -- and I am not 
criticizing the fact but only analyzing it -- a slight 
overweight in the south. The Nordic countries must join. For us 
it has always been absolutely clear that, as a result of 
historic, linguistic, and cultural closeness and ties Austrian 
membership is a matter of course. 
  [Seifried] What is going to happen with membership candidate 
Norway? 
  [Kinkel] I predict that it will work out all right. We have 
made intensive mediating efforts in this case, too. The issue 
of agriculture has virtually been settled. The normative power 
of facts [Die normative Kraft des Faktischen] will also lead to 
a good negotiated settlement with Norway -- at least, that is 
what I am hoping.

  [Excerpts] The European Union [EU] will have three new 
members following the enlargement approved at a long and 
intensive session, which went on into the early hours of the 
morning. The EU will grow to 15 members with the agreement 
reached with Sweden, Finland, and Austria. [passage omitted] The 
Spanish minister of foreign affairs has stressed the importance 
which this enlargement has for our country. He also referred to 
the agreement signed in Washington by the Croats and Muslims: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The foreign affairs minister 
described as magnificent the Croat-Muslim agreement, the best 
news we have received in the past few months. In the early 
hours of Monday morning, Javier Solana learned that the 
negotiations were going well in a telephone conversation with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Foreign Minister 
Solana says that peace is beginning to spread. 
  [Begin Solana recording] Allow me to say, too, however, that 
this is good for our Blue Helmets. Our Blue Helmets are 
deployed in a zone, the southern zone, that is the zone where 
this peace agreement is going to come into effect. So they are 
going to be able to carry out humanitarian work in better 
conditions, they are going to run fewer risks. I should also 
like to convey, therefore, a message of calm to the families who 
have troops there, because this agreement is also good for our 
blue helmets. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] With regard to the enlargement of the EU the 
Spanish Government takes a very positive view of the agreement 
reached last night with Finland, Austria, and Sweden because, 
according to Foreign Minister Solana, besides permitting an 
economically and politically stronger Europe, Spain's objectives 
have been saved. The foreign affairs minister stressed that our 
fruit and vegetables are going to find new markets, doubling 
their exports in some of them. Finally, however, there remains 
a warning to Norway. 
  [Begin Solana recording] We are left with a serious dispute 
with Norway, which is the fishing dispute. I have to say with 
the utmost clarity that, if this is not resolved, Norway will 
not be able join the EU.

  [Text] Commenting on Skopjean press reports that a truck 
crossed the Greek border yesterday carrying industrial material, 
Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the embargo 
against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] is being implemented faithfully. He said the 
measures have not been eased, adding that food and medicines as 
part of humanitarian aid are the only exception. 
  Venizelos described the delay in the United States 
establishing diplomatic relations with Skopje as a positive 
element. Asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher urging all the countries 
in the region to show an interest in Macedonia, as he referred 
to Skopje, the spokesman said: Greece is the friendliest 
country toward Skopje and is interested in its viability and 
development. But [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's continuing 
intransigence does not help it. 
  Referring to an interview with Gligorov in an Athens 
newspaper [paper not identified] today, Venizelos said he saw 
some calm, moderate statements. He added that despite the 
carefully expressed views, the Skopjean president does not 
deviate from his basic position. Venizelos said: With careful 
political dialogue, Gligorov appears as a victim. But the 
international community must also realize that Greece took the 
counter measures because of Skopje's provocative and 
untrustworthy behavior.

<F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Alois Mock to Parliament in </F>
Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, on 29 June 1989, the Austrian 
Parliament asked the Federal Government by an overwhelming 
majority of 175 to only 7 votes to initiate negotiations on 
Austrian accession to the European Community. On 4 July 1989, a 
unanimous resolution to this effect was adopted in the Bundesrat. 
  In fulfillment of this clear parliamentary assignment, on 17 
July 1989, I presented Austria's application for membership in 
Brussels. The actual membership negotiations with the Community, 
which meanwhile has developed further into the European Union 
[EU], started on 1 February 1993. 
  Today, I can inform Parliament that, after marathon talks of 
more than three days and more than 70 hours of actual 
negotiations and talks, these negotiations were successfully 
concluded some 12 hours ago at the political level. 
  I have been told today that Parliament will stick to its 
agenda, and I should present my report today, which I regard as 
an obligation. This is why I only made a short appearance at 
the news conference and retired to prepare my address to this 
Parliament. [applause] 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, even though the legal experts will 
still have to do much work on all the details, one thing is now 
certain: The way for Austrian membership in the European Union 
has been paved. 
  When I think back to the difficult, and even tough, 
negotiations, there is one fact that clearly comes back to mind, 
and that is the strong determination for cooperation that 
encouraged all the Austrians involved in this process of 
negotiations in one way or another. During the long marathon of 
talks over the past few days, and also during the preceding 
weeks, once again I was able to realize that, regardless of 
party affiliations and our individual positions, we Austrians 
are really able to stick together when it is necessary for our 
country. [applause] 
  The positive conclusion of the negotiations was essentially 
facilitated by the political preparatory work, which was done 
particularly over the past year and a half in the capitals of 
the EU -- by the Federal Government, and certainly also by 
members of Parliament. In this connection, I would also like to 
mention the intensive contacts our federal president has had 
with the heads of state and governments, and the parliaments and 
media of the EU member states. I would like to seize this 
opportunity to express my cordial thanks to the federal 
president for his efforts. [applause] 
  In addition, I would like to thank the chancellor, the vice 
chancellor, and all my colleagues in the government, especially 
those who accompanied me to Brussels, and the representatives of 
the provinces, of industry and labor, and public servants for 
the very fine cooperation over the past few weeks and months. 
[applause] 
  The regular talks that have also been going on here for many 
years with the representatives of the opposition were, of 
course, also part of our foreign policy orientation, regardless 
of the differing views of the objectives pursued by the 
government and members of the opposition. 
  I have felt very clearly we are all aware of this being a 
central national issue. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is probably 
the most important issue our country has faced since 1955. I am 
confident the issue of EU membership will be treated with the 
same attitude in this house. Following today's debate I will 
provide you with detailed documentation within the next few 
days. The results achieved in the negotiations mean Austria now 
has the opportunity to take part in the peace work 
[Friedensarbeit] of European integration. And I would like to 
stress, Ladies and Gentlemen, without ignoring the idealism that 
was there in the past as well, that this is specific peace work 
and not just a nice vision, as always we have had in Europe and 
in other parts of the world. In specific terms, the outcome 
means Austria now has the opportunity to be part of the 
community of stability and security in Europe and we have a seat 
and vote in the European organizations creating the future of 
Europe. I am all the more pleased about this because I am 
convinced our entry can take place in conditions that take 
account of the specific situation in our country. I am well 
aware, Ladies and Gentlemen, that in a democracy negotiations -- 
be they national or international -- always will involve 
compromises that require those responsible to set priorities and 
to weigh important points against each other. Regardless of 
the documentation mentioned earlier, I would like to make a few 
points: During the first few months of negotiations we made 
sure that Austria will remain a country where nuclear power 
stations can neither be built nor operated. We have made sure 
that Austria can keep its higher environmental standards after 
joining the EU. We have made sure that Austria can fully 
participate in the common foreign and security policy; the 
Austrian law on neutrality will remain valid after joining. I 
would like to remind you that Burgenland was declared a Target-1 
area in EU regional policy, which means it will fall into the 
group receiving the highest subsidies. 
  Perhaps I should point out one example in particular: 
Austria will be given four votes in the Council of Ministers of 
the EU. In comparison, Germany with its 80 million inhabitants 
has only 10 votes. This means we will have 40 percent of the 
votes of the EU member with the greatest population. We will 
use these votes in the interest of our country and in the 
interest of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, during the last round 
of negotiations we could show -- and this resulted in reports 
that we were being too tough -- we tried to make our positions 
clear. This time we were discussing mainly the issues of 
holiday homes, agriculture, and transalpine transit. As for 
holiday homes Austria can maintain the existing regulations to 
restrict the holiday homes market up to the year 2000, that is 
five years after entry. This fully meets all the provincial 
regulations in this respect. After the year 2000, using 
measures in the fields of regional planning, development, and 
environmental protection, we will be able to ensure that the 
requirements of the local population for housing at adequate 
prices are met first and that Austria's landscape is protected 
from being spoilt by uncontrolled development. These 
possibilities will be recognized and laid down in the final act 
to the membership agreement. 
  Regarding the issue of agriculture, we joined forces to 
achieve solutions in favor of our farmers. On the understanding 
that it is of vital importance for all of us that our farmers 
continue to supply us with healthy food in the future, 
contribute to the preservation of our environment, and can 
participate in the cultivation of our farming sector, I think we 
managed to achieve a result in the negotiations that does 
justice to our specific interests and will secure the future of 
Austrian farmers. [applause] 
  What I regard as a particular success in the talks is the 
result that was achieved by my colleagues in the entire area of 
structural promotion, ranging from compensation payments for 
mountain farmers to subsidies related to environmental 
conditions. The adaptation to the lower level of agricultural 
prices in the Community will be facilitated for Austrian farmers 
through full compensation in the form of direct payments for a 
period of four years. Contrary to initial demands that came 
from within the EU's ranks, these payments will not have to be 
funded exclusively by us but, to a considerable degree, will be 
funded from the EU budget. During this transition period, 
Austrian farmers will receive a total of 7 billion schillings 
from EU funds alone. Another 6 billion schillings in EU funds 
will flow to Austria as part of permanent subsidies in the area 
of regional and structural policy. 
  After particularly difficult negotiations we also achieved 
agreement that the ecological substance of our transit agreement 
be preserved even after Austria's EU accession. That way, the 
transit regime that was concluded at the time, in particular the 
ecological regulations and the objective of a 60-percent 
reduction of pollutants, can fundamentally be maintained until 
the year 2004 -- for the entire federal territory. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen, since this question is quite rightly 
very often brought up, I would like to make the following point: 
A change of the current regime as of 2001 is possible only 
under two conditions, namely if a new common model is developed 
that guarantees the same protection or if a study that is made 
in cooperation with the European Environmental Agency 
establishes that the 60-percent reduction of pollutants has 
already been permanently secured. My colleagues from the 
government who were in Brussels with me will explain any further 
details of the agreements that we reached. 
  At this point I would like to emphasize that I think, all in 
all, we have managed to achieve a satisfying result, which we 
will present for a referendum with a clear conscience. I would 
like to tell this house and my fellow Austrian citizens that, 
with this negotiated result, we now have a basis that will allow 
us to embark on the path to the common Europe with 
self-assuredness. The negotiations of the past few days have 
proved Austria is able to present its positions in Brussels with 
clarity and determination. The warnings that were also voiced by 
some, namely that Austria's inflexible position might lead to 
strains in certain bilateral relations and ultimately uncouple 
our country from the current enlargement process, have not had 
an impact on our policy in the negotiations, a policy that the 
substance of the agreements had precedence over other 
deliberations. 
  I think our efforts have been worthwhile. Austria has 
protected its essential interests in the integration process 
and, at the same time, it now has the real perspective to 
participate in the shaping of the future of Europe as an equal 
partner -- a Europe of peace, security, prosperity, increasing 
environmental awareness, and growing social justice. 
  We have much reason to be happy about the invitation 
extended 
to us by our 12 new partners. Let us accept this invitation. 
It offers a great opportunity for our republic and for our 
nation. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice </F>
Chancellor Erhard Busek by Robert Hochner in Vienna -- live] 
  [Text] [Hochner] Chancellor Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor 
Busek have meanwhile prepared for our interview in the 
chancellor's office. I welcome both of them. Good evening, Mr. 
Chancellor and Mr. Vice Chancellor. 
  Can one deduce from your readiness to come to this interview 
that the reports from Brussels 10 minutes ago are correct -- 
that the membership treaty with the European Union [EU] has been 
concluded? 
  [Vranitzky] Yes, these reports are correct. I am very 
relieved. The hard and persistent work has paid off. I would 
like to thank and congratulate our government colleagues in 
Brussels, who really did superhuman work over these past hours 
and days in Brussels. I also thank the members of provincial 
governments, the social partners, and the many officials and 
other associates and helpers who accompanied them. We have gone 
through a very important stage in a project, the importance of 
which can hardly be overestimated, and now we will immediately 
-- over the next few hours and days -- take the next necessary 
steps regarding the implementation in Austria -- that is, 
government motions, draft laws, and the other things that are 
necessary in this connection. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, you are standing beside the 
chancellor and you have just smiled very obviously. Is this 
just relief that an agreement has been achieved or is this also 
satisfaction with the compromise that has been accomplished? 
  [Busek] First of all, one has to say that the details of the 
past hours or minutes have a bit obscured the view on the whole. 
After all, the whole is Austria's step into the European Union, 
which gives us more security, more market opportunities, more 
prospects for the future. My smile was directed at that, 
because with this, we have opened up a future for us, which 
gives us the most varied opportunities to make the best of it. 
I believe we should not overlook the forest in view of the 
individual trees that we have watched during the most recent 
negotiations -- a forest gives us hope and provides us with 
opportunities for development, because it is better to be in the 
European Union and to follow a path together instead of 
remaining alone. 
  I think this is one of the main considerations, and this is 
also the question we are going to ask the Austrians -- namely 
which way they want to follow. A lot of things will still have 
to be done in this respect. I already know there will probably 
be one point or another where someone will know better and say 
this or that should have been achieved in addition. However, I 
believe one has to see the whole picture here. It is indeed a 
historical step we are taking -- just as we followed the path to 
freedom in 1955 with the State Treaty, we have now followed a 
path that will, as Austrians and for our homeland Austria, 
provide more opportunities in the future. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Chancellor, the conclusion of the agreement 
with the European Union has required compromises -- compromises 
in agriculture and also regarding the Transit Treaty. What 
would you tell those critics who do not see the whole picture -- 
the goal of joining the European Union -- but say: The Austrian 
Government has toppled over here; it should not have made these 
compromises? 
  [Vranitzky] I would simply tell those critics the Austrian 
Government has not toppled over and it should indeed have taken 
and had to take this step, clearly pursuing the goal we had set 
for ourselves. This toppling over that is so often mentioned 
must first be proved, and this will be extremely difficult to 
prove. This is one point. The second point is we now must 
begin to work out the next steps together with the Austrian 
people. 
  We have brought home a result. A high percentage of the 
Austrian people are in favor of Austria's following this path 
into a common Europe. However, there is also quite a 
considerable percentage who are undecided or even against that. 
It is necessary now to work out, together with the Austrian 
people, this conviction and this positive attitude so the number 
of those citizens, who have not yet decided to follow the path 
together with those citizens who have already decided, goes 
down, so we can achieve an agreement and a unification of 
interests, a unification of comments and attitudes. This is far 
more important now than dealing with those on the political 
scene who have always been against it. 
  Both the Greens and Haider's Freedom Party of Austria came 
out today against EU membership, and this was assessed as a 
surprise. For me, it was not a surprise at all. For the past 
months and years they have been against it. Therefore, no one 
should be surprised if opposing voices come from this corner. 
This is obviously part of the political conflicts we will have 
to go through in the future. The most important issue, however, 
is that we must win over that partner who has the actual say in 
the referendum, and that is the Austrian population. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor, during the last stage of 
these negotiations, the Austrian Government -- the coalition -- 
acted with a cohesion it rarely showed during the preparations 
for these negotiations. I just recall the latest discussion 
about second residences. Is there not a danger that this 
cohesion has been lost when it is now necessary to explain the 
results of Brussels to the Austrian people so they vote yes in 
the referendum? 
  [Busek] We have achieved a goal together in a good style in 
the negotiating delegation and also in tackling our task here in 
Vienna together. You may be quite certain that we, as the 
government parties, will not lose sight of the goal -- namely 
leading Austria into a good future. We have a lot of work to 
do, accompanying the treaty and, of course, in implementing it. 
I believe narrow-minded pettiness will be inappropriate here. 
  I believe we will also have to call on all our colleagues 
to act in this manner. Of course, there is one or the other 
question that will be mentioned then. However, it is true such 
agreements are never perfect but also have the character of a 
compromise, with which all sides have to live. 
  However, these things must recede into the background in 
view 
of the fact we have opened up a good, new future for us, and we 
must take all measures to accompany this development. I may say 
we have already achieved some things parallel to the 
negotiations in Brussels and in Vienna, which we will implement 
accordingly. I am very optimistic in this respect, because if 
we do not recognize the dimension of this issue, we will, I 
believe, fail the political task. And in this respect, one can 
already see the cohesion of the two government parties, despite 
all the differences we have now and then. However, we are not a 
unified national party but two different parties that form one 
government. I would really like to see an alternative to that, 
because from what you hear from the opposition parties nowadays, 
you cannot form a common government. 
  [Hochner] A penultimate question to both of you: The 
approval by the Austrians at the referendum is not 
preprogrammed, even though some polls indicate that. What would 
happen in politics if the Austrians were to come out against the 
membership treaty that was negotiated by the Austrian Government 
in Brussels? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, if this is the penultimate question, I am 
already curious about the last question. My answer to your 
penultimate question is that I do not at all expect that the 
Austrian people will not want to follow this path, which the 
Austrian Government has worked out. This would probably also 
mean not joining the other peoples in Europe, and just today we 
have seen and heard on television and on the radio that the East 
European neighboring states are vehemently pushing into the 
European Union. Just imagine a situation in which West Europe is 
united and East Europe joins in, and somewhere in no-man's land 
there is Austria. After some years, the citizens would 
certainly say: This government did not live up to its 
responsibility. We will certainly not give them any reason to 
say that. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Vice Chancellor. 
  [Busek] Well, what is going to happen if.... Let us assume 
that the people vote yes, then what are you going to do with 
this question? 
  [Hochner] Then I have to ask the opposition parties. You 
are right. 
  The last question is nothing mysterious but just involves 
technical matters because the day is a bit hectic and my 
colleagues from the domestic policy department have asked me for 
it. 
  When will the Austrian Government give a press conference to 
brief the public about the actual result of the negotiations? 
  [Vranitzky] Well, in view of the interest the Austrian 
public has been taking in that, you can imagine we will 
certainly be asked sufficiently and extensively about this 
matter, and we will certainly face up to this task tomorrow -- 
together with those of our colleagues who will return from 
Brussels during the night. 
  [Hochner] Thank you gentlemen, and good evening.

  [Excerpts] Finland has reached an agreement with the 
European Union [EU] on conditions of membership. It is said the 
breakthrough in Brussels took place after Finland received, at 
the last moment, a concession from the EU which secures 
Finland's markets from disturbances caused by some imported 
foodstuffs. Finland also managed to receive extra concessions 
from EU countries in agriculture. The Finnish negotiators, 
Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister 
Pertti Salolainen, have just held an international news 
conference in Brussels. In their news conference they said they 
are very satisfied with the reached conclusion. 
  Our reporter Pirjo Auvinen also attended the news 
conference. 
It is said that the result of the negotiations is clear in its 
main features. Do you have more information on the main points 
of the agreement? 
  [Auvinen] In its main features the agreement is very similar 
to the one that has been under negotiation during these two 
ministerial meetings. Finland will have to give up its goal of 
having EU price levels introduced in phases, according to the 
ACA [expansion unknown] model. The European Union did not agree 
to that, and producer prices have to be lowered to the EU level 
from the first day of membership. However, the Union has moved 
a little close to Finland because during the first four 
transitional years the Union will compensate us with about 3 
billion Finnish markkas of the estimated costs. 
  In regional policy, there was a new element in these 
negotiations, the so-called level-six subsidies; Finland has 
agreed to that. It includes the five areas that were put 
forward for the level-one subsidies; in addition the areas were 
extended during the last seconds of the negotiations. 
  [Announcer] What areas are now included, then? 
  [Auvinen] In quickly glancing at this Finnish-language 
version, which was just given to us, I see that for Finland the 
areas included are: Lapland, the Kuusamo area, Kainuu [northern 
areas], Northern Karelia [eastern Finland], Southern Savo 
[central Finland], and some poor areas connected with these 
provinces. Immediately I notice that Southern Ostrobothnia 
[western central Finland] is missing, an area which Finland was 
advocating very strongly. 
  [Announcer] I see. 
  [Auvinen] In agriculture, there were concessions on 
structural transition periods, which range from five to seven 
years. The so-called agricultural subsidies for mountainous 
areas covers 85 percent of Finland's arable lands. It is not 
the full 100 percent Finland wanted to have. The subsidies for 
northern agriculture and the subsidies paid by the Finnish tax 
payers can also in the future only be paid for the areas north 
of Tampere [town in southern central Finland]. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Did I understand correctly that southern Finland 
lies outside these subsidies? 
  [Auvinen] The entire area of southern Finland does not come 
under this national subsidy, either. The European Union did not 
agree to that. It maintained its principle that a whole country 
can not come under any one subsidy. It has not budged on that. 
[passage omitted] 
  The ministers admitted at the news conference that maybe the 
weaknesses that are caused by the climate in Finland, or the 
difficulties in farming, never became quite clear to all 
countries of the Union. The ministers are of the opinion that 
the package of subsidies now reached is complicated and a bit 
too complex; it could have been clearer. 
  [Announcer] That is clear, but we have heard here that some 
details are still being polished. What would these be? 
  [Auvinen] They were not quite clear at the news conference, 
but what was clear was that they are apparently technical 
revisions or comparisons. [Passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] The Finnish Government is also currently 
expecting information on the contents of the agreement, and it 
will discuss the result of the negotiations tonight. The 
Central Union of Agricultural Producers, MTK, does not want to 
comment on the result of the negotiations in any way tonight, it 
has announced. The MTK will announce its viewpoint after a 
meeting of its board of directors tomorrow.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Esko Aho's first comments on the 
results of the EU negotiations have been extremely cautious. 
The clear political negotiation result was turned in Aho's 
mouth into the negotiation basis for an EU agreement. Arto 
Nieminen reports: 
  [Nieminen] After Prime Minister Aho's domestic comments it 
was very difficult to believe that Finland and Sweden had 
achieved negotiation results on the same day. While Sweden 
raised glasses to the negotiation result, actually a victory, 
the agreement had changed between Brussels and Helsinki into 
nothing more than the basis for talks on an agreement. In other 
words, according to Aho, Finland now has a result that provides 
the basis for achieving a result, whatever that means. This is 
what Aho had to say during the night: 
  [Begin Aho recording] This settlement will not go to a 
referendum. I listened to a piece of news that said that if the 
referendum accepts this, then the matter is clear. This is not 
an agreement to join the EU. This is a political solution that 
enables the conclusion of an agreement to join the EU. Much 
work is still to be done on this that must be brought to a 
conclusion. In addition, I would like to stress here that quite 
a few of these matters were left dependent on our national 
actions and I am sure it is in the interest and to the advantage 
of all that the content of these national solutions will soon be 
clear. [end recording] 
  [Nieminen] According to Aho, at first it must be clarified 
what the agreement actually contains in detail. Negotiations 
will be started on the domestic subsidy measures which the EU 
agreement requires. Thus, further negotiations are to be held 
at least in Finland. Aho thought that about a week would be 
spent on studying the agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The negotiations between Norway and the European 
Union [EU] gained impetus yesterday when Sweden and Finland 
agreed with Brussels on their conditions for entry. The 
Norwegians have now agreed with the EU on the main outlines of 
an agricultural settlement. Norway accepts the EU's farming 
prices from the first day of its membership. The agricultural 
producers, however, regard the settlement achieved as a total 
defeat for Norwegian farming, reports Ulla-Maria Johansen from 
Oslo: 
  [Johansen] Finland's negotiation settlement, in particular, 
has speeded up Norway's membership talks, and yesterday the 
government backed down from its decision to postpone the talks 
until next Tuesday. As a result of the talks which resumed last 
night, Norway and the EU reached agreement on the main lines of 
an agricultural settlement. However, the agreement has not yet 
been formally approved and details have not been made public. 
According to statements by Agriculture Minister Gunhild 
Oyangen, Norway has, however, accepted EU prices from the first 
day of membership, the compensation to be paid to Norwegian 
agricultural producers as well as the subsidy to be paid to the 
food industry. In addition to the regions north of 62 degrees 
latitude, the negotiations have achieved that frontier areas, 
which have the same production conditions as the north, are to 
be included in northern farming and EU subsidies. 
  The Norwegian parties have refrained from commenting on 
information which has leaked about the agricultural talks as 
long as formal approval by the two sides for the negotiation 
result is still lacking. The farmers' central organization has, 
however, already branded the agreement as total defeat and the 
small farmers' central organization has described as it worse 
than expected. The `No to the EU' movement, for its part, 
demands a nine-month period for an EU debate before a 
referendum, and according to the latest opinion poll, before the 
talks on the agreement start, 28 percent of Norwegians are in 
favor of EU membership, while 42 percent are against it. 
  The fishing negotiations also resumed in Brussels last night 
and, according to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen, the two 
sides have come closer to each other on the issue of EU 
marketing freedom for Norwegian fish and fish products. There 
has been no progress in other issues. The fishing negotiations 
will continue today and one of the most problematic issues will 
be Norway's demand to keep the fish resources north of 62 
degrees latitude within national control. Norway does not want 
to give the EU the right to decide on the fishing quota for 
Arctic cod in the northern waters together with Russia. This is 
Ulla-Maria Johansen in Oslo.

  [Excerpts] We now have Premier Carl Bildt with us on the 
phone. What is your comment on the negotiations breakthrough in 
Brussels? 
  [Bildt] The talks have been very tough but a few minutes ago 
they were solved in that the European Union [EU] side announced 
that they had accepted the final position taken by Sweden as a 
result of the give and take which has been going on for quite 
some time. This is, of course, of extraordinarily great 
significance. This is the most important international agreement 
Sweden has concluded this century. It opens the way for full 
Swedish participation in European cooperation, widens the 
political horizon, and provides new economic opportunities. 
[passage omitted] 
  In matters of substance, it is a very satisfactory result. 
It is my hope now we will also achieve an agreement between the 
EU and the other countries, perhaps above all Finland and 
Norway. I understand that as regards Finland, above all, it 
seems to be very close now. 
  I also want to say that in my opinion there has been 
extraordinarily skillful negotiation work by the Swedish 
delegation led by Ulf Dinkelspiel in Brussels. There has also 
been very close consultation with the Social Democrat 
opposition. All this has contributed to success becoming 
possible. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Twelve should be at least thirteen from 1 
January 1995. After three days and nights of negotiations, 
Sweden ended up accepting the final proposals of the European 
Union. [passage omitted] Here is the Swedish minister of foreign 
affairs, Ulf Dinkelspiel. He is satisfied, and optimistic about 
the referendum which is to take place in his country: 
  [Begin Dinkelspiel recording, in French] A feeling of joy 
that we have concluded the negotiations; now there remains 
approval by parliament and the referendum, but we have created a 
good basis for both of these. I am sure that on the basis of 
this agreement, which is a good agreement, we shall end up with 
a yes to the agreement. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] After intensive negotiations it is now clear in 
principle: An agreement [exists] between Sweden and the 
European Union [EU], which will be the basis of possible Swedish 
EU membership and which the Swedish citizens will decide in a 
national referendum. After talks are concluded, all negotiators 
normally say that they are pleased, and Swedish Minister for 
Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel was no exception when he met journalists 
in Brussels this afternoon. 
  [Begin Dinkelspiel recording, in English] This is a historic 
date, a historic date. We have, for all practical purposes 
concluded our negotiations for membership of the European Union. 
[end recording] 
  [Reporter] This is a historic day for Sweden, Minister for 
Europe Ulf Dinkelspiel said when he met the international press 
in Brussels today. [passage omitted] Most of the questions 
which were solved in the final spurt concerned agriculture and 
the budget. And as to the budget, Sweden had demanded a 
so-called phasing-in stage, i.e., a reduced EU membership fee 
during the first years. The EU has never accepted this model; 
instead, the EU will send money directly to Anne Wibble, and the 
finance minister says today that she does not know yet what will 
be printed on the check, that means it is not certain what the 
EU will call the subsidy. In figures this means that Sweden 
will pay the full fee of almost 20 billion Swedish crowns only 
in the fourth year of membership. During the first year Sweden 
will pay 450 million Swedish crowns more than what the EU is 
paying to Sweden in the form of various kinds of support and 
subsidies. [passage omitted] 
  As to the subsidies for agriculture in Norrland, Sweden will 
have the right to continue to support the three northern areas. 
Money from the EU will be in the form of three different forms 
of support, where the so-called environment subsidies cover the 
whole of Sweden. 
  The regional subsidies were a less disputed question during 
the last 24 hours because it was already clear earlier that 
Sweden would receive subsidies similar to those given to the 
poorest areas of the EU. The subsidies will concern 450,000 
people in the areas of Norrbotten, Vaesterbotten, and Jaemtland 
and, in addition, 11 provinces in Dalarna, western Norrland, 
Vaermland, and Gaevleborg. 
  Two major questions are unsolved because the EU member 
countries have not been able to agree among themselves. In 
conflict with other countries, Spain demands that Sweden's entry 
to the future foreign exchange union be delayed so that Spain 
will not be in a worse situation when qualifying itself. Spain 
and Britain have demands which concern the number of votes that 
can get a proposal rejected in the Council of Ministers. Those 
questions are expected to make next week's foreign ministers' 
meeting in Brussels a stormy affair.

<F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "EU Fund Closed to Small Projects in </F>
the Baltics"] 
  [Text] The EU [European Union] fund for small- and minor 
business projects in the Baltics has been depleted. The money 
has been spent on the creation of advisory centers, and new 
funds will not be appropriated until the middle of 1995. 
  There will be no new initiatives financed by the EU in the 
three Baltic countries for a year and one-half. 
  The EU fund in support of small- and medium-sized 
enterprises 
(SME) in the Baltics has been depleted completely, and no more 
funds from this particular section of the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program will become 
available until the middle of 1995. 
  The money has been swallowed up in the establishment of 
business advisory centers in the three Baltic countries, and 
there is not a red cent left for more down-to-earth programs. 
<H5>  Procedure Results in Problems </H5>
  The Council of Artisans welcomes the idea of advisory 
centers, but finds it alarming that the EU fund for SME has been 
depleted. 
  However, it is not only the missing millions that the 
Council 
finds disturbing. Another problem is PHARE's very bureaucratic 
appropriation process. 
  Only projects that the receiving countries themselves apply 
for are given support. This benefits only government interests 
in the Baltics to the detriment of private projects, among 
others those enterprise-to-enterprise programs, on which the 
future business structure in the three Baltic countries has been 
based. 
  Another difficulty is the fact that, after revising the 
Danish support arrangements for East Europe, one stresses the 
importance of linking these to international sources of 
investment. 
  In this way, small- and medium-sized enterprises have been 
let go because they do not have a chance in the world of 
competing with the big ones in getting their share of 
international funds. 
<H5>  Large Grant to Poland </H5>
  The PHARE program has set aside ECU230 million between 1990 
and 1992 for development of small- and medium-sized enterprises 
in East and Central Europe. Of this, only ECU9 million have gone 
to the three Baltic countries -- corresponding to 3.75 percent 
of the total amount -- while about 40 percent -- ECU9 million 
has been spent on SME projects in Poland. 
  The total PHARE program for East and Central Europe was 
granted ECU1 billion (almost 8 billion kroner) in 1993, and a 
similar amount has been set aside for 1994. The PHARE 
appropriations, consisting of a combination of professional aid 
and financial support, is spent on: 

  -  Changeover and privatization of government 
businesses. 
  -  Support for the private sector, especially small 
businesses. 
  -  Modernizing of financial systems. 
  -  Development of a 
social safety net.

<F P=106> [David Gardner report: "EU States Struggle To Make the Votes </F>
Add Up"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- An internal European Union [EU] row 
over how to adjust its voting rules to accommodate more members 
is threatening to undermine negotiations in Brussels this week 
which saw Sweden, Finland and Austria agree to join the Union. 
  It will not make it easier either for the EU to focus on the 
problems of the Norwegians, who are holding out for better entry 
terms, especially on fish. 
  The apparently technical dispute over the EU's "blocking 
minority" voting system masks firmly opposed views about the 
balance of decisionmaking power between big and small states, as 
well as tensions between sovereignty-conscious nationalists and 
federalists. 
  Spain and the UK want to keep existing rules to preserve 
their ability to block measures they dislike. Currently, 23 
votes out of 76 (normally two large states and one small) can 
stop legislation in the Council of Ministers. 
  If all four applicants enter, the 16 would share 90 votes, 
according to their size. A majority of the 12 want to maintain 
the carefully nurtured existing balance between big and small EU 
club members by requiring 27 votes to block proposals, a figure 
arrived at by arithmetical extrapolation from present rules. It 
was decided at the 1992 Lisbon summit to postpone until the 1996 
constitutional review any radical look at how a Union set to 
expand later into East and Central Europe should take decisions. 
  Madrid accepts 27 as the threshold except when three member 
states with at least 23 votes object or even abstain. In 
practice, this means two large and one small country. 
  However, the European Parliament, which has to decide by 
March 10 whether to start approval proceedings for the new 
members in time for them to enter next January, wants to make it 
even more difficult to block Euro-laws. At the moment the 
Parliament says it will not put through enlargement if the 12 
keep the blocking minority at 23. 
  The issue has to be resolved by EU foreign ministers meeting 
in Brussels on Monday [7 March] and Tuesday, when they will also 
have a last try at reaching terms with Norway. Mr Theodhoros 
Pangalos, Greek chairman of the Council of Ministers, said on 
Tuesday night: "We have domestic problems to be solved, but 
they will not stop a successful enlargement." He may be being 
optimistic. 
  Contacts by telephone and letter have taken place this week 
between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, President Francois Mitterrand 
and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to try to resolve the voting 
rules dispute. 
  Senior European Commission officials believe the UK will 
budge, through fear of endangering the EU's expansion. The 
British themselves are cryptic. Their position on voting "is as 
firm an element as anything in our negotiating brief," one 
official said, only hours before Britain caved in on the issue 
of agriculture subsidies for the newcomers. 
  Spain is another matter. Mr Carlos Westendorp, its European 
affairs minister, has made clear Spain must get some fish from 
Norway's rich waters and its blocking minority formula. Madrid 
believes otherwise that it and Italy and Greece could be 
outvoted on issues which concern them alone, like, for instance, 
olive oil subsidies. 
  Mr Gonzalez supported this line in a letter to Mr Kohl this 
week and at a press conference in Madrid. It would be 
politically difficult for him to get neither fish nor votes. 
  Norway sticks unswervingly to its line: "Not a single fish 
for Spain," leading one German diplomat to tell a Norwegian 
colleague that "negotiating with you is like Salman Rushdie 
negotiating with the Iranians." 
  But some negotiators believe Oslo might "consolidate" the 
fish it conceded as part of the European Economic Area trade 
zone treaty, which came into force this year but would cease to 
apply once Norway joins the Union. Its battle cry could then 
become "Not a single new fish" for Spain. 
  Some Brussels diplomats believe, too, that Spain could be 
flattered into line, if it got its present eight votes raised to 
10, putting it on a par with the other big countries: France, 
Germany, Britain and Italy. The flaw in this argument is that 
two votes added to 23 does not make 27; Spain's interests would 
still be vulnerable.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Wider Europe"] </F>
  [Text] Enlargement of the European Union [EU] to the east 
and the north has come closer after Tuesday's accord in Brussels 
on entry terms for Sweden, Finland and Austria. The deals still 
have to be approved by the European Parliament and by national 
referendums later this year. Whether or not agreement can be 
reached for Norway, the fourth applicant from the European Free 
Trade Association [EFTA], will depend on next week's haggling 
over fishing rights. If these four states join on January 1 
1995, the Union's population and gross domestic product [GDP] 
will increase respectively by 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent, but 
its gains in economic resources and political values will be 
greater. 
  These small but wealthy economies will bring net 
contributions to the EU's budget. More important, the new 
members will spread the Union's commitment to liberal democracy 
to the borders of the former communist bloc, preparing the 
ground for the crucial next stage of enlargement towards Central 
and East Europe. 
  The EFTA applicants, already part of the free trade 
arrangements of the European Economic Area, want EU membership 
to gain a political stake in Europe's development. However, in 
view of their electorates' scepticism about the benefits, entry 
comes with a price tag. Reflecting this week's agreements to 
offset the impact of reductions in EFTA farm prices, the 
newcomers' budgetary contributions will be phased in, and even 
by 1998 will be around ECU2bn less than earlier foreseen. This 
act of compensation requires creative adjustment to EU financing 
rules. Yet, provided these concessions secure Yes votes in the 
referendums, the price will be worth paying. 
  Tuesday's agreement does, however, raise larger questions 
about the much greater amounts of money at stake in the next 
phase of enlargement. The German government can be expected to 
make extending membership to Hungary, the Czech Republic and 
Poland a centrepiece of its six-month presidency of the Union 
that starts in July. Further enlargement, perhaps by the year 
2000, is highly desirable for political reasons. But the 
accession of members with, at present, GDP per capita of less 
than 30 per cent of the EU average cannot be contemplated 
without large changes in financial mechanisms governing 
agricultural support and structural fund payments to poorer 
regions. 
  Prof. Richard Baldwin, in a book to be presented at the 
Centre for Economic Policy Research in London next month, 
calculates that, on unchanged policies, membership by the most 
advanced East European economies would add a net Ecu58bn to the 
EU budget by 1999. This would require a 60 per cent increase in 
1999 budget contributions -- a condition that could be met 
neither by Germany, the largest contributor to the EU, which is 
already complaining about its rising net payments, nor by 
Britain or France, the other two main net contributors. 
  To increase the effectiveness of decision-making among a 
larger membership, the EU needs to push through institutional 
changes that go beyond the modest adjustments in voting 
procedures currently under discussion in Brussels. However, 
assembling a majority for cuts in the EU's budgetary largesse 
for present beneficiaries from 1999 onwards may prove 
impossible, in view of the strong vested interests of farmers 
and the poorer southern countries. The road to a wider Europe 
is now open. Yet, if the destination is to be reached, the EU 
must find answers to questions of institutional and financial 
reform that so far have barely been raised.

<F P=106> [Kevin Done report: "EU and Tokyo Close on Vehicle Import </F>
Numbers"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The European Commission and the 
Japanese Government are close to agreeing a forecast for new 
vehicle sales in the European Union [EU], which would leave the 
level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU virtually unchanged 
from last year. 
  The Commission is optimistic that last year's prolonged 
conflict over the level of Japanese vehicle exports to the EU 
can be avoided. 
  The latest round of talks, which ended in Tokyo at the 
weekend, had shown for the first time that little divided the 
forecasts of the two sides, Mr Martin Bangemann, European 
industry commissioner, said yesterday. 
  The EU expected new vehicle demand in West Europe to remain 
virtually unchanged at last year's very depressed level, said Mr 
Bangemann, while the Japanese Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry, was forecasting modest growth of up to 3 percent. 
  The EU market for cars and light commercial vehicles fell by 
15.9 percent to 11.739 million last year, the steepest decline 
of the postwar period. 
  In its original estimates last year Tokyo had refused to 
accept gloomy European forecasts of a steep fall in sales and 
was then forced to curtail exports drastically last autumn to 
bring shipments in line with the 1991 EU/Japan accord on 
Japanese vehicle sales in the Union. 
  Direct Japanese vehicle exports to the EU fell last year by 
18.4 percent to 980,000 units. The Commission expects a second 
round of talks with Tokyo to be held in mid-March. 
  Addressing a European car industry forum organised by the 
Commission and the European Parliament, Mr Bangemann gave his 
clear backing yesterday for a continuation of the current 
controversial "block exemption" for the motor industry, which 
allows carmakers to use a selective distribution system with 
exclusive dealers in breach of European competition law. 
  The 10-year block exemption is due to expire in mid-1995, 
and 
the Commission is still divided over whether to accept the motor 
industry's demand for the selective distribution system to 
continue. 
  Mr Bangemann said that the system played an important role 
in 
the monitoring of Japanese vehicle sales in the EU. "On no 
account should this be endangered," he said. 
  He also dismissed arguments from European consumer 
organisations that the system was responsible for high car 
prices in the EU. 
  "I do not believe that getting rid of the selective and 
exclusive distribution system would lead to more choice and 
lower prices -- but just the reverse," he said.

<F P=106> [Article signed MTH: "Blows for CDA and PvdA, Gain of D66 </F>
Disappointing"; as released by The Hague ANP Database] 
  [Text] The Hague -- All leaders of the major parties called 
the advance of the far right, the election result's main setback. 
  In Amsterdam, the CDA [Center Democratic Appeal] climbed 
from 
2 to 4 seats. In Rotterdam, the combined ultraright-wing 
parties will probably become the second largest movement, with a 
total of almost 14 percent. The CD has five councilors, CP '86 
[Central Party 86] keeps its only present councilor. In 
Utrecht, Janmaat's party (CD) tripled, and has now three 
councilors. In addition, the city is witnessing the entry of 
the Dutch Block, headed by Janmaat's former companion Vreeswijk. 
In the Hague, the CD doubles its number of seats from 2 to 4, 
while CP'86 keeps its only present seat. 
  A conversion to the consequences for the House of 
Representatives, is very precarious. First of all, the 
municipal elections are characterized by the phenomenon of local 
lists, secondly the turnout is generally higher for 
parliamentary elections, and a third uncertain factor is that, 
in local elections, the voter may vote for a well-known 
candidate of a different (national) party than in national 
elections. However, this does not alter the fact that municipal 
elections are generally considered to be a reliable poll for 
parliamentary elections. 
  Converted to the House, the CDA [Christian Democratic 
Appeal] 
would take a dramatic plunge of 15 seats to only 39 seats. The 
PvdA [Labor Party] would also suffer a considerable loss, and 
would keep 32 of its present 49 seats. The VVD [People's Party 
for Freedom and Democracy] would win six seats, and arrive at 28 
seats. D66 [Democrats 66] would soar from 10 to 22 seats, 
Groenlinks [Green Left] would double its number of seats to 12. 
SGP [Political Reformed Party], GPV [Reformed Political Union] 
and RPF [Reformational Political Federation]) combined would 
climb from 6 to 11 seats. The CD would grow from its present 
one seat to 4. The SP [Socialist Party] would enter Parliament 
with 2 seats. 
  The outcome of the municipal elections shows an almost 
terrifying correspondence with the latest poll conducted by 
Inter/view last Monday on behalf of Press Agency ANP and current 
affairs feature Nova. 
  Considering a reliability margin of 1.5 percent for the 
major 
parties, the poll was perfectly correct. The only exception is 
the considerably lower gain for D66 (22 seats instead of the 
anticipated 28), which Inter/view failed to forecast. CDA's 39 
seats correspond to the 38 forecasted on Monday. This is also 
true for PvdA's 32 seats (was 31). VVD's score of 28 was 
perfectly correct, as well as GroenLinks' 12. The CD's 
converted 4 seats were also exactly as forecasted.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd: "Why We Won't Be </F>
Dragged Into the Quagmire"] 
  [Text] The Bosnian civil war, like the Spanish Civil War in 
the Thirties, stirs strong frustration and anger here -- and 
bitter comment, as in the caricature of British policy by John 
Nott which the Evening Standard Published last week. 
  Policy has to rest on facts. The great majority of those who 
are fighting in Bosnia are Bosnians. Bosnian Serbs have 
besieged Bosnian Moslems in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croats have 
besieged Bosnian Moslems in Mostar. Bosnian Moslems have 
besieged Bosnian Croats in Vitez. 
  All now receive some help from outside. The Bosnian Serbs 
and the Serb government in Belgrade bear the greatest 
responsibility for starting the war and for the atrocities 
committed in it. That is why the international community 
imposes sanctions against the Serbs and not the others. But 
even now, after fighting and ethnic cleansing, the different 
communities in Bosnia are hopelessly mixed up on the map. That 
is why the parallel with Kuwait in 1990 is out of place, and why 
in the end there will be no stable military victory. 
  John Nott advocates lifting the arms embargo. So did the 
Americans last year. It was not the British Foreign Secretary, 
but the majority of the Security Council which turned this down. 
If it had been lifted, all sides would have rearmed. Instead 
of dying down, the war would probably now be in full blaze. It 
might well have spread by now to other parts of the Balkans. 
Petrol does not put out a fire. 
  A British government needs to look at the British interest 
-- 
the interest of a European nation with limited resources but 
willing to work hard with others for a more decent world. 
  It is in our interest to stop the war spreading -- and so 
far, with our allies and partners, we have succeeded. 
  It is our interest and instinct to help keep people alive, 
to 
relieve cold and hunger. Hence the 160 million pounds of your 
money which we have spent already on the humanitarian effort. 
Hence the 2,500 British troops escorting the convoys -- a 
bigger contribution than any except the French. Hence our aid 
workers and civilian drivers like Paul Goodman who lost his life 
last month. 
  I don't have much time for those who belittle this effort. 
Of course, keeping people alive is not the same as ending the 
war. But it's a good deal better than leaving them to starve or 
freeze. 
  It is in our interest to help efforts for a negotiated 
peace. 
The fighting will only be stopped by those who are doing the 
fighting. That sounds obvious. But some people witter on as if 
outsiders hold the key to peace. What outsiders can do is 
prepare the way with ideas and a framework for negotiation. 
That is what David Owen, Thorvald Stoltenberg and Peter 
Carrington before them have been doing. One day, when a peace 
has been built, their names will be found on the building blocks. 
  If the surgical use of force by the West could have ended 
the 
war, we would have used force long ago. The justification has 
been there. But government, unlike retired Defence Secretaries, 
have to weigh the consequences of what they propose. 
  We have to pay heed to professional advice. Britain has been 
more cautious than some others about talking of the use of 
force, and has asked practical questions about proposed 
rhetorical declarations. 
  If the UN forces escorting convoys are attacked, they will 
be 
protected from the air. If the relief of Srebrenica or the 
reopening of Tuzla airport are prevented, these operations can 
be helped forward from the air. If the No Fly Zone is 
infringed, it can be enforced, it has been this week. If the 
Bosnian Serbs renege on what NATO and General Rose have achieved 
in Sarajevo, there, too, air power could be used. 
  On balance, we believe that these measured commitments can 
deliver benefit which outweighs the risks. We do not warm to 
the idea of military operations entered into without judgement. 
They might satisfy the television viewer for a week or two, but 
could then draw us month by month, or even year by year, into a 
quagmire of loss and casualties. 
  Ministers have the power to put at risk the lives of British 
servicemen. They should do this only after consultation and 
calculation, not to snatch a headline or appease a mood. 
  There will be setbacks and more bloodshed yet before there 
is full peace in Bosnia. But in the last few weeks the patient 
work of many countries and individuals shows signs of bearing 
fruit. 
  As the Prime Minister's visit to the United States showed, 
our disagreement with the Americans over Bosnia last year is now 
history. We work harmoniously with our fellow troop 
contributors, of which the core is European. We helped to bring 
the Russians back into the peace effort. From this work we now 
hope for four main results: 
  First, the resumption of air convoys. They were suspended 
when air strikes and retaliation against air strikes seemed 
likely. Those in charge on the ground have to judge the risks 
day by day. The trucks and drivers are getting back on the road 
to central Bosnia which our engineers partly built and which our 
army manages. 
  Second, the civil life of Sarajevo should be restored. Under 
General Rose French, British, and other troops keep the peace. 
It should now be possible to open roads and restore services. 
The Prime Minister and President Clinton announced a joint 
British-American mission to visit Sarajevo urgently to consider 
how to help the city get back to as normal a life as possible. 
  Third, the benefits should spread to other towns and 
distressed areas. The plan for opening Tuzla to relief supplies 
should be carried out. Mostar, Vitez and the Maglaj pocket need 
relief. this means redeploying the UN force and may need extra 
men. Britain, France, Spain, Holland, Canada, Malaysia and many 
other countries are doing their bit. The extra should come from 
elsewhere. 
  Fourth, the peace process needs to be revived. The Americans 
and Russians are needed here. If either hangs back, there will 
be generals and politicians in Bosnia who will advise against 
signing up to a peace agreement. We should not be dogmatic 
about the content. It has to be agreed, not imposed. 
  If, thanks to American initiative, the Croats and Bosnian 
Moslems are willing to come together in a confederacy, well and 
good. Everyone, including the Bosnian Serbs, know that a 
settlement has to start with substantial Serb withdrawal from 
land they now occupy. 
  We have put an end to war in West Europe. That is one reason 
why the European Community was founded. 
  Neither NATO nor the European Union now can sensibly claim 
to 
be able to stop wars in Central or East Europe. but we have to 
try. Not by rhetoric and pretence, but by bringing those 
countries step by step into the European framework which we have 
created. 
  Exhaustion, pressure and persuasion are opening the way to 
an 
end of the war in Bosnia. but that is only the beginning of our 
task.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Wider Still and Wider"] </F>
  [Text] After four days of exhausting negotiation, partial 
victory is within sight. Sweden, Finland and Austria yesterday 
signalled acceptance of the terms offered for their entry to the 
European Union [EU]. If the deal is endorsed in the promised 
referendums, the EU's borders will be extended from next January 
east to the Russian frontier and north beyond the Arctic Circle. 
  The inclusion of these three rich, stable democracies ends 
the long and unfortunate exclusion of Scandinavia and the Alps 
from the political and economic mainstream. Apart from Denmark, 
no country from Europe's northernmost tier has been able to 
bring to the continental union its enormous assets: a rich 
history, a vibrant culture, a deeply embedded commitment to 
democracy, a disproportionate influence within the United 
Nations and a moral outreach far beyond the lakes and forests of 
its isolated region. 
  Britain has long pressed for their inclusion; enlargement of 
the Community was the main task the British presidency set 
itself. Federalists feared that widening would prevent deepening 
and would dilute the cohesion of the cosy continental club. If 
this was ever true, it only strengthened the argument for 
enlargement. British sympathy for its former partners in the 
European Free Trade Association may have played a part, as may 
the unvoiced hope that northern Protestant rectitude would be a 
useful counterbalance to the more excitable political traditions 
of the Mediterranean. 
  The disappointment yesterday was that only three instead of 
four applicants were able to clinch agreement. Hours after the 
expiration of Monday's midnight deadline, Austria was still 
locked in tense negotiations, mostly over its insistence on 
keeping a limit for the next 10 years on heavy lorries crossing 
the Alps, worries that alpine chalets will be snapped up by 
non-Austrians and difficulties in compensating high-cost 
mountain farmers who must cut prices to EU levels. But at the 
last moment a deal was struck. 
  Norway, by contrast, was always the most problematic 
applicant. It has admitted deadlock and put off further 
discussions until next week. Its failure to conclude a deal 
would be deeply disappointing. Even the Austrian Government, 
once buoyed by public opinion, has seen a steady fall in support 
for membership as one issue after another -- the environment, 
traditional neutrality, disillusion over Brussels bureaucracy 
and a growing right-wing Austria-first nationalism -- has 
undermined the case for membership. 
  Norway, on the rim of Europe, is a much more difficult case. 
Norwegians, separate from Sweden for less than a century, care 
passionately about their sovereignty, their fisheries and their 
simple way of life on their sparse, long northern coastline. 
All are under threat, and the Spanish demand for access to 
Norwegian fishing waters may be the last straw that turns a 
suspicious public against any outcome. Once before Norway has 
fallen at the final hurdle. Another rebuff would so scar the 
political establishment that no Oslo government might be able to 
contemplate membership again. 
  Even in Finland and Sweden, public opinion cannot yet be 
taken for granted. Finland is probably now the most 
pro-membership, converted by its current recession and the new 
security threat from an unstable Russia. If a referendum is 
held here first, the result might encourage wavering Swedish and 
Austrian voters. All four countries have made substantial 
concessions to accept the entire EU post-Maastricht deal. 
Brussels must now do its utmost to offer terms that Norway can 
accept. A wider union is a better union, one that in the future 
must also include Central and East Europe.

  [Text] Bonn -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has 
emphatically welcomed the agreement [between the Bosnians and 
Bosnian Croats achieved in Washington]. By its dedicated 
participation, the U.S. Administration has made an essential 
contribution to it, Kinkel said in Bonn. Right down to the 
final stage of the negotiations, there was close coordination 
between Germany and its partners, in particular the United 
States. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressly 
thanked the Federal Government on the telephone. 
  Kinkel stated: "The momentum for a political and peaceful 
solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina must now be used with 
all one's strength. It cannot and must not be permitted that 
barbarism returns to Europe." Bonn expects the parties to the 
negotiations to settle the remaining open questions with good 
will and with the goal of coming to a lasting agreement.

  [Text] -- On ZDF's [Second German Television Channel] 
"Heute Journal" program, [State Minister Bernd] Schmidbauer said 
that since the summer of 1992, the Federal Government has "not 
just had vague indications but very specific indications" that 
"a subterranean facility is being built in a dry valley" in 
Tarhuna. This facility "was discovered and uncovered, and all 
the necessary steps" were initiated in international cooperation 
to warn all "relevant companies." "Interministerial work 
groups" have "watched this project for many months." 
  It has been "possible to identify the project before the 
project was completed, before any machine was in this project, 
and up to now, these machines have not been housed in this 
project." "For the first time," it has been "possible to inform 
the companies beforehand, to follow up on all information, and 
to approach relevant companies that produce such equipment." 
  There is "not a single clue pointing to a German company 
that 
is furnishing this facility"; however, there are indications 
that in building the tunnel, multipurpose equipment, which is 
used all over the world, has been used, which "could also come 
from Germany." These clues have been under investigation ever 
since they turned up. Schmidbauer: "This new chemical factory 
cannot be built as planned because there were certain 
precautionary measures that did not permit it; however, such a 
company is still being built." [sentence as received]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Help for the scrapping of about 2,00 
tanks and for coping with the radiation consequences of the 
Chernobyl reactor accident were the central topics during the 
first visit by Belarusian Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka to 
his counterpart Klaus Kinkel on Thursday [3 March]. In addition 
to a cultural agreement, the ministers also signed a framework 
agreement for the "promotion of cooperation in alleviating the 
consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear accident." 
  According to the Foreign Ministry, Kinkel stressed Germany's 
interest in stability in Belarus and recommended participation 
in NATO's Partnership for Peace, which he called an important 
building block for an all-European security architecture. At a 
subsequent press conference, Kravchanka was restrained in his 
comments and only called the offer "interesting." The cutting 
off of gas supplies by Russia is not a political problem, but 
only due to bureaucratic "problems of accounting," Kravchanka 
said. 
  In the reduction of conventional armament, Belarus has 
become 
a collection pond of about 2,000 tanks so far, the scrapping of 
which it cannot carry out on its own. It asked France, Great 
Britain, and Germany for financial and technological aid. 
Belarus' greatest tragedy is, however, still the Ukrainian 
Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Almost the entire territory was 
contaminated by the radioactive fall-out, which moved northwest. 
An increasing number of lethal cases of thyroid cancer in 
children has given Belarus a sad front ranking in the 
international statistics, Kravchanka stated.

  [Text] Potsdam (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) expects the government in 
Oslo to come to [applaud] the positive decision about Norway's 
planned accession to the European Union (EU) by next Monday [7 
March]. After the meeting of the liberal group in the European 
Parliament (LDR) in Potsdam, he said on Wednesday that a 
compromise regarding the problems of fishing quotas is 
foreseeable. Furthermore, Kinkel stressed that Germany will 
advocate more rights for the European Parliament. 
  The LDR group has 45 deputies from 10 countries and is thus 
the third largest group in the European Parliament. It holds a 
meeting in Potsdam from Tuesday to Thursday.

  [Text] Cologne/Saarbruecken (DPA) -- The leading 
associations of the Germany industry have described the 
enlargement of the European Union [EU] by Sweden, Finland, and 
Austria as a positive signal for enterprises in Germany. The 
Federal Association of German Wholesale and Foreign Trade (BGA) 
expects new jobs and lower prices from the enlargement of the 
European Union. 
  The accession of the three countries will provide new 
impulses to the German export economy, BGA Executive Director 
Peter Spary said. "We are now even bigger than the North 
American free trade zone NAFTA [North American Free Trade 
Agreement]," Spary said on Saarland radio. The German consumers 
can also be happy about the enlargement: "Competition in 
wholesale and foreign trade will reduce prices even further." 
  The Federal Association of German Industry [BDI] in Cologne 
stated that the Germany industry was relieved that the 
membership negotiations with Sweden, Finland, and Austria were 
concluded on time and is hoping that agreement with Norway will 
follow in a few days. 
  For the German industry, the enlargement of the European 
Union by EFTA [European Free Trade Association] countries has 
always been at the top of its European objectives list. "The 
intensive trade and investment relations with this area speak 
for enlargement as do the democratic and liberal traditions of 
these countries." The industry is hoping that with their 
accession, the advocates of a cosmopolitan policy and a policy 
of the market economy by the European Union will receive further 
support.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday [2 
March] adopted a government agreement for approving a 
European-U.S. joint venture for the construction of a uranium 
enrichment plant in the United States. This facility is to be 
built and operated by private companies. According to a 
government spokesman, the plant is supposed to be built in 
Louisiana. 
  The German-British-Dutch company Urenco is involved in the 
project. The goal is to slightly enrich uranium in the plant by 
using the so-called gas-ultracentrifuge method, which is already 
being applied by Urenco. The fuel rods are intended for 
light-water nuclear power plants on the U.S. market. 
  The framework agreement adopted by the Cabinet ensures that 
the operation of the facility will observe the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty on the nonproliferation of weapons-grade 
material and that the safety measures of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency are taken into consideration. According to 
the spokesman, the facility is exclusively intended for the 
peaceful use of nuclear material.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- After a severe public conflict of 
opinions, the Federal Cabinet on Wednesday [2 March] gave the 
starting signal for the construction of the first track for the 
Transrapid magnetic levitation train from Hamburg to Berlin. 
The service on the 284-km long line with one stop in Schwerin 
should open by the year 2005, with trains circulating in 
10-minute intervals and ticket prices of approximately 100 
German marks [DM]. Of the DM8.9 billion in total investments, 
Bonn will initially provide some DM5.6 billion. 
  Transport Minister Matthias Wissmann and Research Minister 
Paul Krueger, both of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], 
stated that the Cabinet decision has "opened a new chapter in 
the history of transport technology." The Transrapid is a 
"trend-setting project -- economically, ecologically, and in 
terms of transport policy." The Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] is altogether against the project. 
  Both ministers and top representatives of the leading 
companies involved in the development of the system, Thyssen 
Industries and Siemens-Transport Technology, have emphasized 
that the Transrapid demonstrates Germany's efficiency as 
industrial center. It was pointed out that German developments 
are still about four or five years ahead of the forward-pressing 
competitors, mainly those from Japan. 
  The SPD and environmental associations reject the project 
mainly for financial reasons but also for reasons related to 
transport policy and spoke of a "flop costing billions." 
Instead, priority should be given to regular trains, which are 
an environmentally friendly means of transport. [passage

<F P=106> [Discussion between Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and </F>
Hermann Rappe, chairman of the IG-Chemie Trade Union, moderated 
by Norbert Hoefler and Dieter Huenerkoch; place and date not 
given: "A Strike Would Be a Disaster"] 
  [Text] [STERN] Mr. Rexrodt, Mr. Rappe, during the two 
hours that we are going to spend here, 150 people will lose 
their jobs from a purely statistical point of view. Can you 
tell us something about that? 
  [Rexrodt] I can tell you a lot about that. The Cabinet has 
just presented a program to clearly improve the competitiveness 
of German companies, because they are the ones that abolish or 
create jobs. With a package of 40 to 50 measures the Federal 
Government wants to make sure that, for instance, research and 
innovation and their transfer into new products are promoted and 
that the labor costs of companies are reduced so that new 
companies can conquer new markets. 
  [Rappe] These are measures that have a medium-term effect 
and about which we agree in many areas. However, what are you 
doing to overcome the current economic crisis? We need a 
program so that the horses drink again [as published]. 
  [Rexrodt] The biggest economic development program that has 
ever existed in Germany is currently underway -- with new debts 
of 70 billion German marks [DM] incurred by the Federal 
Government alone and a gigantic transfer of money to the new 
laender. 
  [Rappe] We should make a clear distinction here. The 
reconstruction of the new laender is a structural task. What we 
need is an additional economic development program amounting to 
DM30 to DM40 billion to stimulate demand, also at the cost of 
higher debts. This would be compensated for by additional tax 
revenues. 
  [Rexrodt] I think that your demand for even higher new debts 
is irresponsible. This would push up interests and prices and 
finally strangle the economic development. 
  [Rappe] Then I do not see how we are going to overcome mass 
unemployment. 
  [Rexrodt] In 1994, we will have a growth of 1 to 1.5 
percent. In 1995, at the latest, the rapid improvement of the 
international economic development will also have an effect in 
our country; at the same time our measures to improve 
competitiveness will begin to have an effect. 
  [Rappe] You know just as well as all economic researchers 
that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent, which is still doubtful 
anyway, will not reduce unemployment at all. On the contrary: 
The rationalization and technology effect of 2 to 2.5 percent 
will make sure that even more jobs will be abolished. This will 
change only when the growth rate lies above the technology rate. 
However, you can only dream of that. 
  [Rexrodt] We simply cannot incur any more debts. There is 
no way out, Mr. Rappe, we must all tighten our belts. The 
ancillary wage costs must be reduced, and wages must be lower in 
real terms for a certain time. 
  [Rappe] But that means that you damage the economic 
development even more if the people have less and less money to 
spend and those who have enough money do not spend it either, 
because they do not know how bad the future will be. In 
addition, in almost all companies the benefits that are above 
the collective wage agreement are being abolished. All in all 
-- including inflation -- this means a loss in purchasing power 
of almost 10 percent for 1993-94. 
  [Rexrodt] I do see the problem that people have less money 
to spend, even though I do not see it as being as drastic as you 
do. However, we must get through that. This is the only way in 
which we can ease the cost burden on the companies so that they 
can sell more on the world market again. Then, in 1995, we will 
have at least a stabilization of the labor market and, 
afterwards, new jobs again. Otherwise, we will ruin our economy. 
  [STERN] Are you also referring to the imminent strike in the 
metal industry? 
  [Rexrodt] A strike in the metal industry or elsewhere would 
be an economic disaster. This would nip the incipient recovery 
process in the bud. 
  [Rappe] If the employers in the chemical industry were to 
demand from us the same concessions that are now demanded from 
the working people in the metal industry, I, as trade union 
chairman, would never sign that. This is unacceptable and 
extremely damaging to the national economy because of the 
purchasing power. We agree, Mr. Rexrodt, that the cost burden 
on the companies must be eased. But there are many other 
possibilities to achieve that apart from a one-sided 
renunciation of wages. For instance, a reduction of ancillary 
wage costs, by, for instance, making self-employed people and 
civil servants contribute to the general expenditures for caring 
for the labor market, namely by a labor market contribution. 
You can also raise the limits for contributions to the social 
insurance so as to include those who earn more to a greater 
extent. Why have you been blocking that for years? 
  [Rexrodt] First, there are constitutional difficulties 
regarding the civil servants. And, regarding those who earn 
more and the self-employed, in such difficult times one must not 
ill-treat those in society who perform most. 
  [Rappe] You could also divide the Federal Employment Office 
into a pure insurance for unemployed that is financed by 
contributions, and a labor market policy institution. 
  [Rexrodt] We agree on that. The cost of labor market policy 
must be carried by all tax payers. This would clearly reduce 
the contributions and thus the ancillary wage costs. The burden 
on the companies would be eased. 
  [Rappe] Why is your government not initiating this? I get 
the impression that you are just saying this year, and in 
reality you mean to limit yourself to social cut-backs to reduce 
ancillary wage costs, which would mean an even greater loss in 
purchasing power. 
  [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, this is not true. You hear that I am 
thinking about that. I do not want to abolish the social state. 
I want to safeguard it by making sure that it can be financed. 
However, I also state clearly: Social benefits must not be 
taboo nor the roughly 40 percent of the ancillary wage costs 
that are regulated by collective agreements. 
  [Rappe] I am of a completely different opinion in this 
respect. Why are we not talking about other possibilities to 
reduce costs, about the cumbersome management in the companies, 
which is not even able to use the already existing possibilities 
of flexible work time? This would improve production costs and 
create new jobs. In the chemical industry, for instance, there 
is the possibility of part-time wage agreements with half-day 
work. Only about 3 percent of the companies use that. This is 
miserable. Most wage agreements also provide more flexible 
machine-time. 
  [Rexrodt] I can even add one thing to that. The middle 
management echelons, in particular, have ignored the 
possibilities for part-time work and flexibility models in an 
incredible way. Certain fields of management have not done their 
work. 
  [STERN] Mr. Rexrodt, you also want to create new jobs 
through low-wage areas. 
  [Rexrodt] We have to think about how we can give jobs to 
people who are little qualified and would otherwise turn into 
long-term recipients of social welfare. Particularly in the 
service sector there are innumerable possibilities for that, for 
instance in trade, in the transportation sector, and in 
gastronomy, but also in private households. If simple work can 
be paid for again, it is also in demand. However, for that we 
must also find other possibilities for dismissal. After all, 
many companies do not hire people, because they cannot get rid 
of them again or, if they can, they have to use an expensive 
social plan. 
  [Rappe] That catches my attention. What kind of working 
conditions are these supposed to be? 
  [Rexrodt] The trade unions have to work that out with the 
employers, Mr. Rappe. 
  [Rappe] Dismissals at the whim of the entrepreneur cannot be 
achieved with the trade unions. I do not want American 
conditions. 
  [Rexrodt] Neither do I. But if it turns out that a little 
qualified person cannot live up to the requirements, it must be 
possible for the company to dismiss him again without any major 
complications. Otherwise, this is not going to work. 
  [Rappe] We will not agree to wages below the collective wage 
agreement, which sets down the minimum wages. 
  [Rexrodt] Then you deprive many people of any opportunity 
for employment. 
  [Rappe] No. The Federal Government could, for instance, 
provide subsidies to finance work instead of financing 
unemployment. Then one can talk about various things. 
  [Rexrodt] Granting state subsidies for wages would be 
absurd. I think the discussion about a second, financially 
supported labor market is dangerous, because the people then 
settle down there instead of seizing professional opportunities. 
  [Rappe] I just want to bridge the next four to five years. 
How long do we want to watch rising unemployment? I am just as 
afraid as you are of a lasting second labor market. 
  [STERN] In view of millions of unemployed, will the Germans 
have to work more or less in the future? 
  [Rexrodt] The future requires a labor market, which provides 
individual people with the opportunity of working very much less 
and thus, naturally, also earning less; 10, 20, or 30 hours per 
week. However, 40, 50, or 60 hours must also be possible, 
depending on how this can be made compatible with the 
operational and personal requirement. This will be a completely 
flexible labor market. And the conditions for that must be 
negotiated by the individuals themselves. 
  [Rappe] First of all, the people will certainly not, 
generally, have to work more. This would just increase 
unemployment. And we will quite certainly prevent such a wage 
policy wilderness as you propose. What I can imagine, perhaps, 
are annual work time contracts. How the work is distributed 
over the year remains the business of the parties involved on 
site. They must negotiate this in a way that both sides benefit. 
  [Rexrodt] Mr. Rappe, area wage contracts are outdated, both 
regarding wages and work time. 
  [Rappe] Of course, I also see that, in the future, more and 
more company-related elements will play a role. However, the 
area wage contract is indispensable as a framework so as to 
prevent distortions of competition between the companies and a 
wage wilderness. We will never agree to a situation of wage 
policy lawlessness, Mr. Rexrodt.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The expansion of the money 
supply surprisingly sped up at the beginning of the year. On 
Wednesday [2 March], the German Bundesbank stated that the M3 
money supply in January -- after it was seasonally adjusted -- 
was superior to the average level of the fourth quarter 1993 
with an annual rate of 20.6 percent. 
  Apart from the notes and coins in circulation, the money 
supply M3 also includes sight deposits, time deposits with 
maturities of less than four years, and savings deposits. 
According to the Bundesbank, all these components grew rapidly 
in January. "The pace of expansion was strongest for sight 
deposits." For 1994, the Bundesbank is seeking a monetary 
increase between 4 and 6 percent.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The role of liaison man Klaus 
Steinmetz, who was uncovered during the antiterrorism operation 
in Bad Kleinen, in the Red Army Faction (RAF) has not been 
finally clarified by the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control 
Committee. There are also still "incongruities" concerning his 
relationship with the Rhineland-Palatinate Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution, participants revealed after a 
meeting of the Committee in Bonn on Wednesday [2 March]. 
  Thus, it is unclear what Steinmetz did for the authority and 
why the Land Office for the Protection of the Constitution did 
not tell the Federal Government earlier about the liaison man, 
who was allegedly infiltrated in the RAF command echelon, it was 
said. It was stressed that the suspension of the criminal 
proceedings against Steinmetz, which was ordered by the chief 
federal prosecutor's office, is only a temporary measure. 
Further insights might be gained from the criminal proceedings 
against Birgit Hogefeld, who was arrested in Bad Kleinen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta Meets Stoltenberg"] </F>
  [Text] Rome, 2 Mar (ANSA) -- The preliminary understanding 
reached in Washington between Muslim and Croat authorities from 
the ex-Yugoslavia republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and recent 
events in Bosnia were discussed here today by Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta and Thorvald Stoltenberg, one of the 
international mediators chairing the Geneva Conference on 
ex-Yugoslavia. 
  A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said Andreatta 
and 
Stoltenberg expressed great satisfaction with the accord reached 
in Washington for the formation of a confederation in 
violence-torn Bosnia and view this as a positive turning point 
in the negotiating process. 
  Italy, the communique recalled, has actively favored 
rapprochement between Sarajevo and Zagreb and sought to further 
dialogue between Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and the 
Bosnian Muslim president, Alija Izetbegovic, at the time of a 
visit to Rome by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic, on 
February 3, for talks with Andreatta. 
  The Italian minister, who has directly followed developments 
in this area through meetings and contacts with Croatian and 
Muslim authorities, agreed today with Stoltenberg on the point 
that the institutional framework now crystallizing between the 
two sides could become a fundamental stage for the settlement of 
the entire set of disputes pertaining to ex-Yugoslavia. 
  Andreatta and the international mediator also stressed the 
need to maintain the pace of political and diplomatic 
initiatives in the successive phases of the accord. For this 
purpose, greater commitment will be required to win a deeper 
involvement of Bosnian Serbs so as to move on to a global 
political solution to the conflict. 
  The importance of strengthening consultations among the 
European Union, the United States and Russia, for the purpose of 
consolidating the coordination of international actions, will 
also be indispensable for achieving results, within the 
framework of the Geneva Conference, acceptable to all sides, 
said the two men. 
  At the end of their meeting, Andreatta invited Stoltenberg 
to 
Trieste for a meeting of the Central European Initiative, 
scheduled for Friday [4 March] and Saturday. Expected for this 
assembly are the Bosnian and Croatian foreign ministers for 
discussion on the details of the accord reached today in 
Washington.

<F P=106> ["G.C." report: "Segni Says `Yes' to Constituent Government"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- The Pact for Italy's four musketeers (Segni, 
Martinazzoli, Amato, and La Malfa) want to convince the Italians 
that it is pointless to vote for the left-wing or right-wing 
bloc. This, "because," Mario Segni argued, "they are not 
government blocs or alliances capable of governing, but merely 
tactical electoral groupings that are bound to fall apart 
immediately after the election." However, the alliance centered 
on the Pact, which has confirmed Mario Segni as its candidate 
for the premiership, is "a real government alliance with 
homogeneous programs and objectives." 
  The Pact leader recalled the major conflicts within the two 
rival alignments -- within the left over government stock, NATO, 
and public appointments; and within the right over virtually 
everything, in view of the fact that [Northern League leader] 
Bossi wants to have nothing to do with [Italian Social Movement 
leader] Fini. Therefore, Segni said, "serious dangers would 
ensue for the country if the others were to win: On the one 
hand, there are those who cite fascism, and, on the other, those 
who have remained beyond the Berlin Wall." Segni also described 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's promises to reduce taxes as 
"demagogic and rash," and pointed out that Governor of the Bank 
of Italy Antonio Fazio has already issued this warning: "To 
promise a major reduction of tax pressure means to forget about 
the problem of the public debt." 
  La Malfa condemned the errors committed by Berlusconi (by 
allying with Fini) and Occhetto (by allying with [Communist 
Renewal] Bertinotti), but argued that the dialogue remains open 
with the League. Martinazzoli, however, spoke about "Bossi's 
delirium." 
  What about them? "Either we have sufficient votes with which 
to govern or we will stay out of it," Segni said, though in view 
of the heavy blow dealt to his lists, he would be happy to 
obtain the 4 percent necessary to accede to the 25 percent 
proportional quota. But, he said, if there is no majority, the 
country will be in trouble. He therefore agrees with the 
desirability of a constituent government ("as long as it does 
not include the fascists," Amato added). He is also in favor of 
a second electoral round, "which would facilitate governability 
and encourage alliances." Martinazzoli commented: "We would 
already have achieved this, had it not been for the opposition 
from Occhetto, who had to pay heed to [Communist Renaissance 
leader] Cossutta and [Rete leader] Orlando on alternate days." 
Looking at the postelection situation, the PPI secretary, while 
recognizing Ciampi's merits, would prefer a government "more 
consistent with the philosophy of a parliamentary republic," 
because, he explained, "a country would have to pay for the 
eclipse of politics." 
  The Pact for Italy's program was also presented at the press 
conference. It contains five main points: a major reduction of 
unemployment, the reform of public finance, the completion of 
the institutional reform, the creation of social institutions 
based more on solidarity than on bureaucracy, and a foreign 
policy that espouses the Western ideals of freedom and democracy 
with a view to countering the resurgent specter of ethnic, 
racial, and religious hatred.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Member of Parliament Mannino </F>
Questioned"] 
  [Text] Palermo, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- MP Calogero Mannino, an 
ex-Christian Democrat in the race for a Senate seat in the March 
27 general elections, was questioned here today by state 
prosecutor Teresa Principato and assistant prosecutor Vittorio 
Teresi on a string of allegations of complicity with the Mafia 
recently gathered from Mafia gangsters who have turned state's 
witness. 
  The MP and former cabinet minister, 54, received a warrant 
formally advising him he is under investigation on the charge of 
complicity in Mafia association. 
  Raised by the magistrates today were parts of testimony 
provided by informants Giuseppe Croce Benevento and Leonardo 
Messina who have told investigators that Mannino maintained ties 
with Mafia families and promised to use his political clout in 
matters of interest to the Agrigento boss. Thousands of "men of 
honor" and their families were allegedly made available to the 
Christian Democrat of the time, whose old party is now named the 
Italian People's Party. 
  Informed judiciary sources here said Mannino was also 
questioned on accusations which had not originated with the 
mafiosi state's witnesses, mainly on his relations with public 
notary Pietro Ferraro, arrested one month ago on a Mafia 
association charge. 
  These magistrates, said the sources, have taken over the 
records compiled during an earlier investigation of the 
politician based on the word of another Mafia state's witness. 
On October 11, 1991, an investigation into Mannino, the 
minister for the Mezzogiorno at the time, was shelved. This 
probe originated with an informant's testimony.

<F P=106> [Victorino Ruiz de Azua report: "Aznar Orders Any </F>
Negotiation With PSOE To Be Suspended From 1 March"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria 
Aznar told leaders of his party in mid-January that the 
negotiation with the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] must 
be suspended from 1 March. Aznar justified this decision in 
terms of the need to achieve tangible results in the talks with 
the Socialist group and, especially, of the advisability of 
setting limits to the public dialogue with the Socialists in 
order to avoid reaching the preliminary campaign for the 
European and Andalusian autonomous community elections in June 
with the leaders of the two major parties "taking photographs of 
each other." Nevertheless, the People's Party leader emphasized 
that this decision involves no change of tactics; rather, it 
means adjusting them to different political situations. 
  The decision to end the negotiation for the present, until 
after the June elections, was presented by Aznar in the Canary 
Islands, in a secret conversation prior to the meeting held by 
the People's Party National Executive Committee in the islands 
17 January. The People's Party chairman convened what some 
leaders know as a "sanhedrin" or "conclave," and what Aznar 
himself calls "the usual meetings." 
  These meetings, which are devoted to reflection at decisive 
moments but at which no decision is ever taken, are attended by 
the main national leaders, the parliamentary spokesmen, a select 
group of Executive Committee members, and some people who do not 
belong to any party body, such as Pedro Arriola, Aznar's adviser. 
  The People's Party chairman argued at that meeting that it 
would not be intelligent to allow the PSOE to prolong the 
democratic impetus negotiations indefinitely. It would be 
tantamount, he said, to giving the public the impression that 
there is a basic consensus between government and opposition and 
that, essentially, the government is conducting the only policy 
that the situation allows, given the absence of a serious 
alternative. 
  Aznar, who is rather disappointed by the results of the 
democratic impetus, from which he was hoping for more, gave 
precise instructions to continue to negotiate, but only until 
the end of February. During that period, he demanded, every 
effort must be made to secure the greatest possible agreement, 
then the democratic impetus of which the Socialists speak or the 
democratic regeneration -- the term which the People's Party 
prefers -- will be wound up, at least by the People's Party. 
<H5>  Strategy Review </H5>
  Aznar tried to make it clear that this decision to suspend 
any dialogue with the PSOE from March does not mean a change of 
course. He is prepared to continue to hold talks with Felipe 
Gonzalez when they both see fit, and remains convinced that he 
should not return to all-out opposition because it would serve 
only to exacerbate the country's situation, according to 
People's Party leadership sources. 
  Since last year all Aznar has personally curbed the PSOE's 
attempts to extend the democratic impetus to areas other than 
the central government, the Congress of Deputies, and the 
Senate. For instance, the Socialists' offers to attempt 
parallel negotiations in autonomous communities were interpreted 
from the outset as a mere attempt to eliminate or blur his 
opposition role. 
  The review of the party's overall strategy will come, as 
Aznar himself has explained, after the European elections and 
with their results on the table. Reviewing does not necessarily 
imply changing. Party leadership sources state that no attempt 
will be made to hasten legislative elections, even with a major 
victory for the People's Party over the PSOE. 
  When Aznar says that he wants the legislative term to be 
completed he "is telling the truth," the same sources stress, 
because what the People's Party should seriously consider is 
whether it wishes to win in order to govern for three or four 
years or in order to stay in the Moncloa Palace for 10 or 12 
years. According to this semiofficial analysis circulating in 
the party's upper echelons, an election victory before the 
municipal and autonomous community elections scheduled for May 
1995 could prove suicidal, because it would confront the central 
government with a dense network of municipal councils and 
autonomous communities in the Socialist Party's hands. [passage

<F P=106> [Article signed SM/HS: "Father Aristide Before Commission </F>
on Human Rights -- `Bloody, Ferocious, and Barbaric Dictatorship 
in Haiti'"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Mar (ATS) -- Addressing the UN Commission on 
Human Rights on Wednesday [2 March], exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide stated: "For 30 months Haiti has been 
subjected to a bloody, ferocious, and barbaric dictatorship." 
He claimed that, since his overthrow by the Army on 30 
September 1991, the repression has led to over 5,000 deaths. 
  "The putschists and their international allies want to 
condemn the Haitian people to a slow death," the president 
continued. Speaking at a press conference, Father Aristide 
stated that these "international allies" were in fact "narcotics 
traffickers" who were supplying the putschists with money and 
arms to maintain their "narcotics regime." According to the 
Haitian president, some 40 to 48 tonnes of cocaine pass through 
Haiti each year, with a street value of $1.2 billion. 
<H5>  Omnipresent Army </H5>
  Army chiefs and the Haitian police must leave "immediately," 
Father Aristide told the Commission. For the putschists, the 67 
percent of the population that elected him into presidential 
office "must be reduced to a group of men and women condemned to 
accept neocolonialism or death." 
  With 7,000 men, the Army "absorbs more than 40 percent of 
the 
national budget." In the opinion of the deposed president, the 
legal system no longer functions because the weapons of the 
putschists are "constantly aimed at" the judges. Journalists 
have been forced underground. 
  "The colonization that followed in the wake of Christopher 
Columbus led to the genocide of the American Indians. Ninety 
million of them were lost in the first 100 years following the 
arrival of the explorer from Genoa. In Haiti the genocide is 
continuing," added president Aristide. "Some 300,000 Haitians 
are displaced in their country. Moreover, Haitian political 
refugees who try to enter the United States by sea are arrested 
just off the coast of Haiti and are delivered to the putschist 
murderers or die at sea," Mr. Aristide continued. 
  President Aristide told journalists that he was opposed to a 
UN Security Council draft resolution that would considerably 
strengthen the embargo against Haiti with the cooperation of all 
parties but which did not explicitly mention the deposed 
president. He intends to raise the matter with UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Saturday in New York.

<F P=106> [Article signed PO, UC: "Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister and </F>
Switzerland Wish To Promote Peace in Middle East"; as released 
by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 3 Mar (ATS) -- The Middle East peace process 
was the central theme of the official visit by Israeli Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin on Wednesday [2 March]. "The 
Hebron massacre forces us to accelerate this process," Beilin 
declared to the press after his meeting with Secretary of State 
Jakob Kellenberger. The latter assured him of support from 
Switzerland, which will open an office in Jericho soon to assist 
in West Bank reconstruction. 
  Mr. Beilin also met with Flavio Cotti, head of the Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs, for 45 minutes. In the 
afternoon, he was scheduled to meet with the presidents of the 
Foreign Affairs Committees of both Chambers. 
  The deputy minister reconfirmed Israel's commitment to 
peace, 
six days after the slaughter in Hebron in which 52 Palestinians 
were killed by a Jewish settler. In the near future, the 
release of 900 Palestinian prisoners and the disarmament of 
Jewish extremist settlers should help calm the situation. 
  In the long term, the establishment of a Palestinian police 
force in the territories will enable the reinforcement of peace 
and security, the Israeli deputy minister stated. 
<H5>  The Settlers Will Stay </H5>
  Mr. Beilin, however, declared himself opposed to the 
withdrawal of Jewish settlers from the Occupied Territories. He 
also said that he considered Switzerland a "model" state, 
particularly for its military organization and its experience in 
the field of humanitarian commitment. Inspired by Switzerland, 
Israel plans to open a hospital in Angola. 
  For his part, Jakob Kellenberger assured Beilin that 
Switzerland would support Israel's efforts toward peace and 
economic development in the West Bank. Both men discussed the 
allocation of 60 million Swiss francs, promised to Israel last 
year, for reconstruction in the Gaza Strip and in West Bank. 
<H5>  Office in Jericho </H5>
  Moreover, Mr. Kellenberger and his guest agreed to open a 
Swiss office in Jericho in the near future which will coordinate 
efforts to develop the region economically. 
  Mr. Beilin and Mr. Kellenberger also "reached an agreement" 
concerning Israel's request to access records on Jewish refugees 
who were expelled from Switzerland during World War II. An 
agreement also was reached on opening an information office in 
Israel on the European Eureka research project. 
  In conclusion, Mr. Kellenberger said that many questions 
pending since his visit to Israel last May were settled. The 
secretary of state will travel to Syria and Egypt next May.

<F P=106> [Article signed PO: "Official Visit to Great Britain by </F>
Adolf Ogi To Explain the `Yes' To the Alps Initiative, British 
Support"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 2 Mar (ATS) -- The talks between Federal 
Councillor Adolf Ogi and John MacGregor, British secretary of 
state for transport, in London on Wednesday [2 March] focused on 
the Alps initiative. Mr. MacGregor showed great understanding 
for the Swiss `yes' to the initiative. However, according to 
Mr. Ogi, the Federal Council still has to decide how to explain 
the consequences of this popular decision abroad. 
  Mr. Ogi's two-day visit to Great Britain had been scheduled 
for several weeks, before the 20 February vote, said the head of 
the Federal Department of Transport, Communications, and Energy 
(DFTCE). However, the `yes' to the initiative is now forcing the 
Federal Council to come up with explanations to foreign 
governments, Mr. Ogi told ATS. Between now and the year 2004, 
all traffic of goods passing through Switzerland in transit must 
switch from road to rail. 
<H5>  British Support </H5>
  Mr. MacGregor and Mr. David Heathcoat-Amory, minister of 
state of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, assured Mr. Ogi of 
their understanding of the decision by the Swiss people. The 
British Government is willing to support Switzerland within the 
European Union [EU]. Nonetheless, its representatives have 
brought it to the attention of Mr. Ogi that the Swiss situation 
in the bilateral negotiations with the EU is now more difficult. 
  On 18 April, the EU transport ministers intended to adopt a 
double mandate to negotiate with Switzerland on road transit and 
aviation. Now, the `yes' to the initiative has forced the 
European Commission to reassess the situation. 
<H5>  Sporting Metaphor </H5>
  "Just short of the tape, we have been forced to run another 
lap," stated the federal councillor. The promise of British 
support merely represents one single voice within an institution 
of 12 members, he went on. 
  The Federal Council must now decide how to explain the new 
situation to its foreign partners. It will have to guarantee 
that the transit agreement signed with the European Community 
will be respected, without discrimination. 
  The head of the DFTCE will have further opportunities to 
explain the Swiss position, especially at the pan-European 
conference of transport ministers, which will take place in 
mid-March on the island of Crete. One week later, Mr. Ogi will 
meet with European Commissioner for Transport, Mr. Abel Matutes.

result of a crime. The National Council made this decision 
Wednesday [2 March], when it defined the new penal rule for 
combatting criminal organizations. This penal rule, which was 
approved -- without opposition -- by 158 votes, should enter 
into force on 1 July. 
  Henceforth, bankers, trustees, or other business lawyers 
will 
be able to report their suspicions to the penal authorities 
without any risk of violating banking or commercial secrecy. In 
this way, they will avoid the dilemma of acting contrary to 
either the ban on money laundering, or the obligation of 
confidentiality toward their clients. 
<H5>  Hit Hard </H5>
  Saint-Gall socialist Paul Rechsteiner proposed going further 
by making it the duty of financiers to report their suspicions. 
Switzerland acts as a center for international criminal 
organizations. This is where we have to hit hard, he said. 
Only the obligation to inform will make the law effective, Jean 
Ziegler (Socialist Party, canton of Geneva) added. However, the 
Greens and independents were the only ones who shared this point 
of view. 
  The left wants to introduce the "principle of informing" 
that 
was so dear to the former communist regimes, retorted Suzette 
Sandoz (Liberal Party, canton of Vaud). Generally speaking, the 
majority of Swiss feel that the right to inform is enough, 
especially since an obligation to do so can be introduced at a 
later stage with regard to the laundering of dirty money. 
Federal Councillor Arnold Koller stressed that, in any case, no 
provisions were to imply sanctions to bankers who do not talk. 
The Rechsteiner proposal was defeated by 101 votes to 58. 
<H5>  Definition Contested </H5>
  The left was also beaten on another point: the definition of 
a criminal organization, whose members would be punishable by a 
maximum of five years imprisonment. The following definition 
was chosen: "an organization which keeps its structure and 
staff secret and whose purpose is to commit acts of criminal 
violence or to procure income by criminal means." 
  The socialists feel that this definition is too vague, since 
it could be applied not only to the intended organized crime, 
but also to small-time crime. It would take just three people 
to plan to steal from a large store and you could talk about a 
criminal organization, said Nils de Dardel (Socialist Party, 
canton of Geneva). Hence, the proposal for a more detailed 
definition, which includes the crime of corruption. However, 
this was rejected by 121 votes to 36, while Mr. Koller made 
assurances that no judge would take a small gang of hoodlums for 
a criminal organization. 
<H5>  Burden of Proof On The Accused </H5>
  The broader possibility of confiscating the illicit property 
of criminal organizations was not contested. This should make 
it possible to fight organized crime more effectively, namely by 
depriving it of its operating capital. It will no longer be 
necessary to establish from which specific infraction the 
confiscated securities come. It will be up to the accused to 
prove that his property was acquired legally.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Intense pressure was mounting on the Government 
tonight to send extra forces to Bosnia in response to an urgent 
United Nations plea. But the Government made clear it was 
awaiting a commitment from the United States and other countries 
before agreeing. 
  The Prime Minister said the Government would consider 
providing more troops, but only as part of a wider international 
effort. 
  And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind emphasised the 
Government's concern that it is already doing its fair share in 
Bosnia, with 2,500 troops on the ground. 
  He was replying to the appeal for 10,650 more soldiers by 
Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for former Yugoslavia, who 
warned that fragile ceasefires would otherwise collapse. 
  Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in 
Bosnia, warned his troops were operating "on a wing and a 
prayer," well outside normal sensible limits. 
  "If I can give an example -- a week ago there were only four 
Warrior vehicles left to try and control one of the most 
hotly-contested crossing points across the line of conflict in 
central Bosnia and that was in Gorni Vakuf," he said. 
  Mr Rifkind, in a clear reference to the United States, said 
the Government had always said its view would be influenced by 
whether other UN members, including those with "highly-trained, 
highly-professional forces," were ready to contribute. 
  "Britain is already the second largest contributor and 
therefore it is not unreasonable to say that if there was a 
burden to be met, it should be spread properly and widely 
amongst the relevant countries," he said. 
  But he insisted: "We have not ruled out the question of more 
troops." 
  Government sources said ministers were "not reluctant" to do 
more but felt strongly that pressure must now be placed on other 
nations, notably the United States, which has only 15 troops in 
Bosnia, to play a much bigger role. 
  General Jean Cot, UN commander in former Yugoslavia, stepped 
up pressure on Washington saying the American refusal to send 
troops until an enforceable peace treaty is signed was "a 
strange and not very courageous idea." 
  "The better idea is to send troops when they're needed -- to 
enforce the coming of a peace," added. "I would be very keen for 
U.S. troops to be on the ground tomorrow." 
  And in an unusually blunt news conference with Gen Cot, Mr 
Akashi hit out: "We are profoundly disturbed by the lukewarm and 
negative response to date." 
  There was anger in the British military that deployment of 
extra troops to Bosnia could be jeopardised by reports of a 
looming clash with the Cabinet. 
  As rapidly developing peace initiatives give a glimmer of 
hope that an end to the bitter ethnic fighting could be in 
sight, the Government faces tough decisions. 
  The Cabinet rejected the view by the four Service chiefs 
last 
month that Britain should send a second infantry battalion, 
after the urgent request from General Rose for up to 3,000 
reinforcements when the Serbs agreed to pull back their heavy 
weapons around Sarajevo or place them in UN control. 
  The Service chiefs argued it was crucial to be seen to back 
the British general and to support the peace process boosted by 
Nato's tough new approach. 
  But they were overruled by the Cabinet as ministers again 
stressed Britain was already doing its bit. 
  "Emotionally the people in uniform inevitably feel we should 
have done more," said a MoD source. "But the chiefs know they 
are in a political arena and are quite content with the 
decision. There is no split." 
  There are fears that reports -- fiercely denied by MoD and 
military sources -- that the chiefs are squaring up for a major 
row with Cabinet ministers over new deployments could put plans 
at risk. 
  The Army is adamant that nothing smaller than a 
self-sufficient battalion group could be sent. 
  "Anything smaller would be disastrous," said one officer. 
  But a military source said: "These reports have made it more 
difficult to send. Senior ministers could well dig in their 
heels." 
  UN troops are already stretched far and thin across Bosnia 
and there are growing risks that they could be isolated and 
attacked. 
  Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff, urged the 
Government to send a battalion of troops. 
  "Quite frankly, a British battalion -- expert in this sort 
of 
thing -- is worth two or three of some others from other 
places," he added. 
  A company of about 150 Coldstream Guards sent to help to 
police the peace in Sarajevo are living in the back of their 
Warrior armoured fighting vehicles on the side of a mountain in 
heavy snow. 
  "You can only maintain that sort of existence for a short 
period before morale begins to fall," said another officer. 
  There are contingency plans to send a further 2,000 troops 
to 
Bosnia in a crisis to support the force already there. 
  The Army has two infantry battalions equipped with Saxon 
lightly-armoured personnel carriers already painted in UN white 
colours, which would be ideal for peacekeeping operations. 
  Either the Green Howards or the Duke of Wellington's 
Regiment 
could be sent quickly to Bosnia with their 64 Saxons and 
logistics back-up by sea and air. 
  As the RAF's C-130 Hercules transport aircraft can each 
carry 
two Saxons together with men and logistics support, lead 
elements could be in Bosnia within days.

  [Text] London, March 3 (TANJUG) -- An urgent demand by U.N. 
commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose, 
for additional five to seven thousand troops to maintain the 
cease-fire in Bosnia, has caused a rift between the highest 
military officials and cabinet ministers, official sources in 
London said on Thursday [3 March]. 
  The chief of general staff, General Sir Peter Ingle, and the 
air force and navy chiefs have already agreed between themselves 
that Gen. Rose's demand should be met by sending one infantry 
battalion. 
  The decision, however, cannot come into force because 
Defence 
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
were among those who voted against. 
  Hurd and Rifkind pointed out that Britain had already sent 
more than enough of its share of ground troops to Bosnia and 
that the risks were huge of getting involved in a war similar to 
the one in Vietnam. They suggested that some other countries, 
such as Belgium, should give more troops. 
  The final say in the matter rests with Prime Minister John 
Major, who does not want his government to be accused of 
abandoning its best officer, and presently the most successful 
general in Bosnia, in a delicate moment of the Balkan crisis, 
the government sources say. 
  During a recent meeting in New York, Major proposed to U.N. 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that Italy should send one 
contingent to Bosnia, despite Italy's role in Yugoslavia during 
World War Two. 
  In 1941 Italy occupied a part of former Yugoslavia, 
including 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and had held it until 1943. 
  Gen. Rose claims that many of his troops work 24 hours a day 
to accomplish the almost impossible task of monitoring the 
cease-fire along the 50-mile long frontline around Sarajevo and 
on the 200-mile one in the mountains of central Bosnia. 
  If the view of British generals prevails, namely that Gen. 
Rose shoud not be let down, London could then send an additional 
1,000 troops, infantry, engineers, a logistic-communication 
group and two more helicopters within four days, British 
military experts said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Send More Troops"] </F>
  [Text] We report today that the Government and the service 
chiefs are locked in deep disagreement about whether to 
reinforce the British military presence in Bosnia. Unless at 
least another infantry battalion group is committed from 
Britain, the Army is acutely concerned first, that an important 
peace-keeping opportunity under the supervision of a British 
general may founder; and, second, that the British troops spread 
so precariously across Bosnia will be alarmingly exposed if more 
shooting breaks out, unless they are better balanced and 
supported. The Government, conversely, is chronically wary of 
an increased military commitment that would be far easier to 
make than to withdraw from; and ministers fear that neither the 
Conservative Party nor the country feels much enthusiasm for 
sending more troops into the Balkan quagmire. In consequence, 
the Government and some of the most senior members of the armed 
forces are more sharply divided on an operational issue than at 
any time for many years. 
  Bosnia is unusual in that it has united many of the old 
Thatcherites with a wide sweep of liberal opinion -- and 
especially media opinion -- in urging British military 
intervention. We have always found it bizarre that some people 
in this country are so eager for Britain to assume a wholly 
disproportionate share of the moral and military responsibility 
for resolving a Balkan imbroglio when all our European partners 
save France contribute so little. We opposed major Western 
military intervention unless the Americans took part. We were 
dubious even about the dispatch of the British force now 
deployed, precisely because the current embarrassments seemed so 
likely. Once British troops were on the ground, once we had a 
substantial stake in Bosnia, the pressures to increase that 
stake were inevitable and inexorable. More than that, when we 
were asked to send a British general to command the UN forces in 
Bosnia, we did not offer a time-server to make a gesture: in 
Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose we dispatched one of the most activist 
officers in the Army. 
  Now Gen Rose argues that he cannot do the job he was sent to 
perform without more troops -- and not just any troops, but 
high-quality British or French troops. Many of the UN 
contingents on the ground are almost useless for practical 
purposes. Without more men, Gen Rose cannot effectively 
implement and extend the fragile ceasefire that exists; and if 
the tired British soldiers dispersed in company pockets from 
Sarajevo to the coast come under threat, they are highly 
vulnerable. Gen Rose's views and wishes have the support of 
most of the defence chiefs in Britain. The brutal questions 
are, they believe: will we support our own man on the spot? 
And are we serious about wanting him to do the job to which he 
was committed? 
  It is evident that the Americans are not going to get the 
Government off the hook by committing their own forces. 
Washington demands forcefully whether the United States is 
expected to believe that, in the post-Cold War environment, 
10,000 soldiers on the ground in Bosnia is really the best that 
Europe can do. The French have agreed to send an additional 
infantry battalion. With deep reluctance, we believe the 
Government should accept the Army's view that an additional 
battalion should be sent, for a strictly limited term of three 
months. Britain cannot and should not accept responsibility for 
solving the problems of Bosnia. But, given the commitments we 
have already made, and the fragile chance of peace that has 
opened up, Gen Rose deserves the support he seeks. If the 
Government believed that it would prove too hot in the kitchen, 
it should never have set foot there. This newspaper would have 
supported such a decision. But now that we are there, whether 
we like it or not, pusillanimity will do Mr Major's government 
no credit in the face of the clearest professional military 
advice.

<F P=106> [By Peter Mulligan, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary staff] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister today urged the resumption of 
peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians after last week's 
massacre of 50 at a mosque in Hebron. 
  At Commons question time, Mr Major expressed his regrets 
about violence in what he called "that powder keg of the Middle 
East." 
  He was responding to Labour's George Galloway, MP for 
Glasgow 
Hillhead, who said the Palestinian chief negotiator, Nabil 
Sha'th, was present in the Commons gallery to hear the exchanges. 
  Mr Galloway asked the Prime Minister: "Do you have a message 
for Nabil Sha'th in the light of the fact that since last 
Friday's massacre in Hebron, the Israeli Army have shot down 
more people than were shot down by the murderer in the massacre 
itself?" 
  He urged: "Will you suppoort a protection force, made up 
either of the United Nations or at least the co-sponsors of the 
peace process, to protect the Palestinians under illegal Israeli 
occupation?" 
  Mr Major declared: "Violence from any source in that powder 
keg of the Middle East is to be regretted whether it comes from 
the dreadful massacre at Hebron or any other source." 
  He said he believed UN observers in Israel were doing "an 
extremely good job," and he had discussed the situation with the 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali a few days ago in the 
United States. 
  The Prime Minister stressed: "What would be most helpful is, 
as soon as it seems to be politically practicable, for the sides 
to sit down again and continue with the negotiations that have 
made more progress in the last 18 months than for many years 
past. What everyone wishes to see is a comprehensive peace 
settlement there that will enable the people who live there to 
live a decent, civilised and safe life." 
  Mr Galloway, whose visit to Iraq was widely condemned in 
January, was strongly rebuked by Foreign Office Minister of 
State Douglas Hogg when he raised the issue at Commons question 
time yesterday. 
  Mr Galloway criticised the Israeli armed forces which he 
said 
had shot down many people since the massacre. 
  To Tory cheers, Mr Hogg retorted: "In view of your quite 
odious support for Saddam Husayn, I would have thought that you 
would have thought it wise to abstain from participating in 
questions on the Middle East."

  [Excerpts] London, 2 Mar--Douglas Hogg, British minister of 
state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, said that the 
liberation of Kuwait was an unprecedented achievement and a 
turning point in world order. 
  In an interview with KUNA on the third anniversary of 
liberation, Hogg said that the international alliance against 
the ruler of Baghdad ensured respect for Kuwait's sovereignty. 
  He affirmed in an interview at the Foreign Office in central 
London that the Desert Storm operation to liberate Kuwait 
"should send a warning to the Iraqi aggressors that they would 
inevitably be defeated." [passage omitted] 
  He pointed out that the ruler of Baghdad must put an end to 
the operations to "liquidate his people." 
  In reply to a question, Hogg said he was not aware of the 
current cooperation between French companies and Iraq and 
referred to the existence of "a significant difference between 
current and future plans for cooperation." However, Hogg 
stressed that the British Government had approached the French 
Government regarding a number of issues concerning the Iraqis. 
He said: The French are well aware of our views. Hogg 
expressed his conviction that on the whole: We and the French 
adopt the same stance vis-a-vis our policy regarding the Iraqi 
regime. 
  Hogg stressed that there would not be any changes in their 
policy regarding the ruler of Baghdad unless he complied with 
the UN resolutions on the war for the liberation of Kuwait. 
Meanwhile, he said that he did not think it was unlikely that 
the head of the Iraqi regime would attempt to exploit the 
current preoccupation in the West with the issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to embark on a new adventure. In reply to a 
KUNA question on this, Hogg said: That is possible, but he 
would be making a terrible mistake. 
  Hogg said that Britain was concerned about the situation in 
northern Iraq and stressed that the no-fly zone had to be 
respected and its monitoring had to be strengthened. He said: 
We continue to do this. [passage omitted] 
  Hogg hinted that he wanted to visit other countries that he 
had not visited in the region, such as Oman, and pointed out 
that it could take place at the end of next May. No specific 
date had been decided. 
  Concerning the Hebron massacre, Hogg admitted that Britain 
realized the usefulness of an international presence of some 
kind in the occupied territories. Hogg said that he discussed 
the idea with a group of Arab ambassadors accredited to Britain, 
who came yesterday to condemn and denounce the massacre. 
[passage omitted] 
  He expressed his conviction that the circumstances could 
encourage the Israelis to accept this formula. Hogg told KUNA 
that an international military presence in the occupied 
territories should not be in the form of forces but in the form 
of international observers. He once more emphasized the British 
Government's feeling of fear and shock for the occurrence of 
that massacre. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel does not want the example of the NATO ultimatum to be 
applied to other areas in Bosnia yet. In an interview with the 
television company `N-TV' in Berlin on Thursday [3 March], 
Kinkel came out against issuing such an ultimatum "without 
examination" and "automatically" for such cities as Tuzla and 
Bihac. Instead, the "new momentum" has to be used "to make 
political progress." 
  Kinkel nevertheless advocates linking the "political" and 
the 
"military" components. He argues for "tackling the individual 
crisis spots with this combination of the military and the 
political approaches, but above all with the political 
approach." In this way, an "overall solution" should be 
achieved "by a domino effect."

Union/Christian Social Union], the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party], and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] stressed on Thursday 
in a short-notice debate requested by the PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialism], the successor party to the SED [Socialist 
Unity Party]. However, there was no cause for triumph. 
  There is no doubt about the permissibility of the shooting 
down under international law, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
said. The UN Security Council resolution of 1992 covers the 
mission. In the view of SPD Deputy Freimut Duve, if the 
suspected Bosnian Serb fighters had not been shot down, then 
possibly the conclusion of the Washington agreement on 
confederation between the Bosnians and Croats would not have 
come about. The Bosnian Serbs are now invited "to collaborate 
in the difficult construction," he said. 
  The PDS described the Bundeswehr participation in the NATO 
mission, by having German soldiers in the AWACS reconnaissance 
aircraft, as unconstitutional. FDP Deputy Juergen Koppelin 
contradicted this: the deployment of German soldiers in the 
AWACS aircraft has been declared legal by the Federal 
Constitutional Court, he declared. 
  Defense Minister Volker Ruehe stressed: "It is beyond all 
imagining what immeasurable damage the alliance and German 
alliance capability would have suffered had our soldiers been 
obliged to leave the AWACS aircraft." Wolfgang Ullmann, 
Alliance 90/Greens Deputy, said it was high time to make it 
clear that "things are getting serious for the aggressors." 
  Kinkel added that, in order for Germany to retain its 
suitability as an alliance partner, the constitutional legality 
of future Bundeswehr missions must finally be cleared up. The 
SPD, however, had left the coalition "in the lurch" with regard 
to an amendment to the Constitution over this issue.

<F P=106> [Fritz Wirth commentary: "A Ray of Hope"] </F>
  [Text] When everything had been signed, U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher expressed the inconceivable fact in the 
following words: "Up to now, the argument of force had won in 
Bosnia. Now, for the first time, the force of argument has 
won." This was his comment on the new Croat-Muslim federation 
that was negotiated in Washington over the past four days. It 
is a very Yugoslav pact. It creates hope where there was sheer 
desperation only yesterday. It made peace between parties that 
were bloody enemies only yesterday. And, going by the bitter 
experience of the past years, it should be worthless even before 
the ink has dried. 
  But however much past experience may suggest the opposite, 
there is a ray of fresh hope after the latest agreement between 
Croats and Muslims. The reason: This peace has a different 
dimension. For the first time in this conflict the United 
States was the guardian and director of a pact. And the part 
that the long-missed world power can play in this becomes clear 
by the two-week silence of the Sarajevo guns. 
  There is no doubt: The plan for a new federation in Bosnia 
is an agreement full of snags and weaknesses. Its major 
problem: It cannot succeed without the approval of the Serbs, 
who are demanded to return occupied territories. This is 
exactly the point where Russia comes in as the second great 
director of the plan beside the United States. Only the 
Russians are in a position to pressure the Serbs effectively and 
to convince them that any resistance to this plan would lead 
them into isolation. 
  What was signed in Washington is not only a great challenge 
to the Serbs. It is a first test for the Russians and Boris 
Yeltsin regarding their future role in this conflict and the 
efficiency of their new activities in world politics. In short: 
The key to solving the Bosnia crisis now lies with Moscow.

<F P=106> [Jens Schneider commentary: "The Pleasing Race Between the </F>
Superpowers"] 
  [Text] In the past, when people talked about the race 
between the superpowers they had nothing good in mind. It 
expressed fear: The Russians and Americans could force each 
other deeper and deeper into a spiraling arms race and destroy 
the world -- the race was an arms race. American-Soviet rivalry 
over more and more new zones of influence in the world often 
caused the countries concerned more harm than good. 
  Perhaps that old logic has been exhausted. Washington and 
Moscow are currently pursuing the peace process in Bosnia so 
eagerly that what they are doing is very reminiscent of a race, 
and the results so far have been thoroughly positive. First, 
Washington abandoned its restraint following the massacre at the 
marketplace in Sarajevo, and brought about the NATO ultimatum to 
the Serbs. Then, it was thanks to the Russians that the aerial 
bombardment was not necessary: The Kremlin achieved a 
diplomatic coup that resulted in the Serbian withdrawal. At the 
beginning of the week, when NATO finally did shoot, Moscow 
persuaded the Bosnian Serb Radovan Karadzic to open the Tuzla 
Airport and made it clear to him that he could not consider 
Moscow to be an ally. 
  After that, it was once again Washington's turn. The U.S. 
Administration did indeed respond with a success, which -- 
despite all the skepticism -- amounts to being a sensation. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher mediated in the 
conclusion of a preliminary agreement between the Bosnian Croats 
and Muslims on a confederation, which at least offers prospects 
of peace in western Bosnia and could be an excellent instrument 
for putting pressure on the Serbs in the future. 
  Irrespective of how things develop further, there are two 
questions that beg an answer. Why could that not have happened 
immediately? That is a question that many, not only Bosnians, 
will be asking themselves. Second, we must ask ourselves why 
the Americans and Russians must return to the European stage for 
progress to be made in Bosnia. Bonn was unable to use its 
supposed great influence on Zagreb, nor was Paris able to make 
appropriate use of its good contacts in Belgrade. Washington 
and Moscow are in the process of assuming an extremely difficult 
guardianship in Bosnia-Herzegovina: In any event, they will be 
able to apply some slight pressure to their ward, because they 
only love him within certain limits and do not want to protect 
him at any price. Their first goal is an end to the conflict in 
Bosnia. 
  With respect to that goal, we are still at the very 
beginning, and that also applies to the rapprochement between 
the Croats and the Muslims. Over the past few months, the war 
has been shaped by their conflict and not by Serbian conquests. 
Their armies have been involved in brutal fighting and have 
expelled and massacred civilians. For months, the Croats sought 
to starve the Muslims in the western part of Mostar: The Muslim 
army, on the other hand, kept Croatian civilians trapped in 
central Bosnia. In view of this burden, the Americans -- and 
the Europeans too -- will have to apply much pressure and use 
positive stimuli to further the rapprochement.

<F P=106> [Report by Herbert Schaefer from the "Kennzeichen D" program] </F>
  [Text] According to our investigations, the Libyan Embassy 
in Bonn has had contacts for years with German companies. The 
background: after its al-Rabta chemical weapons plant was 
uncovered and destroyed in a fire in March 1990, Libya initiated 
a new, huge armament project -- a tunnel project. 
  Head of state al-Qadhdhafi has claimed that the project is 
an 
irrigation plant for arid areas in the north -- around the Great 
Man River -- a name by which al-Qadhdhafi celebrates himself. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi's lucrative orders also lured German companies 
to the desert. The office of the Frankfurt state prosecutor 
suspected an infringement of the foreign-trade law. 
  [Begin recording Hubert Hart, senior state prosecutor of 
Frankfurt] A short time ago we received a long list of names of 
companies that might have been involved in a project in Libya. 
This will be reason enough for us to examine the matter again, 
and to take a closer look at the mentioned companies. [end 
recording] 
  Pictures of al-Qadhdhafi's tunnel project are not available. 
Nevertheless, eyewitnesses have described it as a bunker system 
65 km southeast of the capital of Tripoli, which is camouflaged 
as an irrigation plant of the neighboring Great Man River 
project. Underground armament plants, runways for missile 
launcher systems, and command centers -- probably the largest 
underground arms arsenal in the Third World. 
  A draft plan was made available to ``Kennzeichen D.'' 
According to it, the tunnel network extends over an area of 15 
square km. The Economics Ministry in Bonn knows. 
  [Begin recording Volker Hahn, official in the export-control 
office of the Federal Economics Ministry, broadcast in progress] 
...that Libya is interested in duplicating the poison-gas plant 
of al-Rabta -- underground. Initially the location was not 
known. Later, evidence accumulated about the location and the 
size of these subterranean facilities. It is true that we 
received information that German products were also used to make 
this tunnel project possible. [end recording] 
  For tactical reasons in connection with the investigations, 
the official would neither confirm nor deny it: German and 
foreign enterprises with offices in Germany did not only supply 
certain machinery for the construction of tunnels, but were also 
active themselves in Libya. Even a long time after the al-Rabta 
chemical weapons plant was uncovered, up to 62 German 
enterprises with more than 1,000 employees were temporarily 
active in the various projects all over Libya. According to 
documents made available to ```Kennzeichen D,'' 57 German 
experts were active in special construction tasks, the 
maintenance of radar systems, and directional radio and computer 
technology. 
  Companies in the Darmstadt and Stuttgart areas have come 
under particular suspicion, as has the branch office of an 
Austrian enterprise for tunnel construction in Frankfurt. 
However, no one is available from that office at the moment. 
Gerhard Sauer, head of the Salzburg company, one of the world's 
most renowned tunnel constructors, is said to have provided 
construction plans for the project near Tripoli. 
  [Begin Hart recording] We are familiar with the connections. 
One or two years ago we actually initiated preliminary 
investigations against the defendant, but we had to close the 
case. [end recording] 
  Because, the ultimate proof was missing, namely that Sauer 
had infringed German export regulations. Nevertheless: 
  [Begin Hart recording] Most recently we have received new 
documents that might provide evidence that business activities 
have taken place here in Germany. This means that we will 
reexamine the case. [end recording] 
  Particularly since evidence provided by eyewitnesses is 
growing stronger that al-Qadhdhafi is also storing barrels with 
poisonous substances, and, unlike what has been hitherto 
assumed, he intends to produce not only chemical but also 
bacteriological weapons. 
  In this connection, Karl-Heinz Matthias, head of the central 
federal customs office for criminal investigations, Cologne, 
said: 
  [Begin Matthias recording] According to the evidence we 
have, Libya is trying to develop such bacteriological weapons. 
[end recording] 
  Is al-Qadhdhafi's desert bunker also a workshop for 
bacteriological weapons, so to speak? Such a laboratory for 
bacteriological tests, which is usually used for pharmaceutical 
projects, is said to have been shipped to Libya via a third 
country, and redesigned there for the production of 
bacteriological weapons. German investigators are currently 
pursuing information in this connection. 
  A bioreactor or fermenter is the centerpiece for the 
production of bacteriological weapons. Libyan scientists who 
trained in Europe should have no problems redesigning such 
bioreactors for systems that can produce any amount of germs -- 
easily and inexpensively: the poor man's nuclear bomb, as 
molecular biologist Manuel Kiper put it: 
  [Begin Kiper recording] Well, with modern biotechnology and 
the necessary facilities -- these fermenters -- it is possible 
in principle to breed a large number of germs within one to four 
weeks, let us say within one month, and to pour them, so to 
speak, into conventional ammunition. [end recording] 
  One example is the highly dangerous anthrax bacteria that 
can 
cause severe ulcers. One can also produce certain fungi that 
can be used to contaminate entire regions and destroy crops. 
  Apart from U.S. products, bioreactors made in Germany are 
the 
leading brands on the market. As a result of recent 
developments the German producers must now expect a close 
examination of their Libya deals. 
  [Begin Hahn recording] We will, of course, examine the 
information we have received. After all, this is a matter of 
preventing the spread or production of weapons of mass 
destruction. We will make full use of all means to prevent that 
as best we can. [end recording] 
  This applies to so-called starting cultures, the feed for 
the 
bioreactor so to speak. According to investigations, German 
institutes sent the sensitive products to laboratories in crisis 
areas -- never, of course, without adding that the material was 
intended for purely scientific and peaceful purposes. 
  In view of the internationally booming mail order business 
for microorganisms, the international warning symbol for 
dangerous bacteriological products sometimes proves to be 
fraudulent labelling. On this issue, Oliver Thraenert, an 
expert on bacteriological weapons from the Friedrich Ebert 
Foundation, said: 
  [Begin Thraenert recording] Of course, they do not have any 
control over the ultimate use, which is the fundamental problem 
of armament exports, especially in the sphere of bacteriological 
weapons. Particularly when we are speaking of exports of 
microorganisms, which reproduce by themselves. [end recording] 
  At least it would certainly be possible to have stricter 
controls at the exporter's end, as is demonstrated by Holland, 
for example. In the central office at (Baarn), near Utrecht, the 
world's largest and model institute for fungi cultures, tens of 
thousands of organisms are the subject of research and are 
stored there. Quite frequently this institute receives orders 
from crisis areas. If, however, a country such as Iran, is 
suddenly interested in fungi of bacteriological weapons-grade 
fusarium kind, the researchers categorically reject cooperation. 
Yet, wherever the Netherlands refused delivery, others helped 
out, for example institutes in Germany. 
  Even though there is a convention against bacteriological 
weapons, which was signed by more than 130 countries, there is 
no control of the contract partners on location. 
  Whether in Libya or other developing countries -- in times 
of 
international conflicts, there is great demand for the poor 
man's nuclear bomb. There is an increasing risk of a war 
involving bacteriological arms, particularly since all necessary 
equipment is cheap and easily available. Control is virtually 
impossible.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Chancellery Minister Bernd 
Schmidbauer has confirmed that the German Government has known 
"for some time" about the construction of a weapons arsenal in 
Tahunah, Libya, near the capital, Tripoli. It passed on its 
information to the "competent body of the German Bundestag," 
the minister said in Bonn on Thursday [3 March]. Investigations 
are being conducted into whether German companies have 
"contributed" to the construction of the project, "in awareness 
of the use to be made of it." 
  In close coordination with foreign partners, the German 
Government has pursued "all available information" about the 
construction of the project and "taken all necessary measures." 
According to Schmidbauer, this has "caused considerable 
difficulties for building the structure." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "Europe Is Expanding"] </F>
  [Text] The inclusion of three Scandinavian states and 
Austria is changing the political and intellectual-cultural 
prospects of the European Union [EU]. The imbalance toward the 
south is disappearing and, with the accession of the north and 
the east, the touch of Carolingian stuffiness is waning. Since 
countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the 
further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of 
cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is 
beginning to dominate. 
  The old-established members of the EC scene in Brussels have 
long predicted this development with regret, and they are not 
wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political 
"deepening" of the Union becomes a rhetorical postulate without 
any prospect for realization. At least the Scandinavians do not 
have any inclination toward integration in the form of a federal 
state. We are facing the end of the late romantic period. 
  With Finland, the Union gets 1,300 km of Russian border and 
the proximity of the Baltic states -- with all the flair and all 
the risk. In the case of Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the 
single market, that is, the real economic and trade policy 
advantage of the community, has the greatest attractiveness. 
However, particularly Finland and Sweden hope for an increase 
in security, at least in political support. With Austria, the 
German language section of the EU is growing. However, more 
important is its function as a bridge to Hungary, Slovenia, and 
Croatia. Here, too, the Union, which has so far been oriented 
toward West Europe, is going to receive a fruitful closeness to 
the East. 
  Until the date of accession at the upcoming turn of the 
year, 
several obstacles -- both in substance and in terms of 
referendums -- have to be overcome. These apply mainly to 
Norway and Austria. In both countries the result of the 
referendums is uncertain; in Finland and Sweden it is considered 
relatively certain. Germany has pushed the membership 
negotiations forward with great energy. As a result, It is 
natural and unavoidable that it has not gained just friends in 
the old European Community.

<F P=106> [Hans Wimmer editorial: "Trialogue in the GATT"] </F>
  [Text] A few weeks before the solemn signing of the new 
GATT agreement, a trade war between the United States and Japan 
is threatening to erupt. The Europeans are trying to mediate -- 
in their very own interest. In fact, compulsory measures by the 
United States against Japan in the sphere of trade policy would 
also affect the Europeans. In a trialogue among the major GATT 
countries, a solution must be found. 
  President Clinton has announced "several trade measures" 
against Japan for March. During the meeting with Clinton, 
Japan's Prime Minister Hosokawa was not ready to bow to 
pressure. However, there is still a possibility of "improving" 
the agreement and opening up the import markets to a greater 
extent. The 1993 Japanese-U.S. trade balance turned out to be 
fuel on the flames. The U.S. deficit increased by 20 percent to 
an alarming level of $59.3 billion. This corresponds to 50 
percent of the entire U.S. deficit. 
  In the Pacific dispute, Japan must show flexibility. In the 
meantime, Prime Minister Hosokawa has announced that Japan is 
preparing "emergency measures" to open up its market to a 
greater extent. They should be adopted before the next G-7 
meeting at the end of the week, if possible. However, the 
secretary general of the government, Masayoshi Takemura, has 
dampened excessive hopes of the GATT partners. Tokyo continues 
to reject the U.S. demand for the stipulation of fixed quotas 
against which the level of market access can be measured. No 
additional spectacular concessions in the sphere of trade 
policies are to be expected from Tokyo. Yet Japan apparently 
wants to avoid an escalation in the dispute with the United 
States. 
  The unilateral U.S. policy of pressure, which threatened 
"retaliatory measures" in the form of new import barriers and 
increased tariffs against Japan is rightly meeting with 
criticism from both the GATT secretariat and the European 
Commission in Brussels. The United States is a long way from 
applying the principles of liberalism in its own country that it 
demands from its trading partners, GATT pointed out. The main 
targets of criticism are the U.S. laws impeding imports, which 
are summarized under the name "Super 301." The number of 
complaints of the partners against the application of these laws 
adopted in 1988 (U.S. definition of dumping, ban on subsidies, 
and the adoption of retaliatory trade measures) is growing 
constantly. 
  On the part of the European Union, its chief GATT 
negotiator, 
Sir Leon Brittan, criticized above all the U.S. demand that 
Japan should guarantee the United States fixed market shares in 
certain areas (for mobile telephones, for example) in bilateral 
agreements. If these markets were only opened up for the United 
States, this would entail disadvantages for the European 
enterprises that want to export goods to Japan. In addition, 
the Japanese exporters would squeeze the products which they can 
not sell in their domestic market (because of the "guaranteed 
shares" for the Americans) into the tight European markets. 
After all, the trade deficit of the European Union vis-a-vis 
Japan has increased to $26 billion this year. 
  Thus, the U.S. trade attack on Japan upsets the fragile 
triangle among the three major world trading powers. In any 
event, both the Americans and the Europeans did not negotiate 
successfully with and vis-a-vis Japan in the large GATT round. 
Tokyo skillfully hid in the shadow of the transatlantic quarrel 
about the liberalization of agricultural trade and the reduction 
of "green subsidies." It is not exactly a sign of diplomatic 
skill to bang the table during the current talks. The Europeans 
and the GATT partners are also interested in greater access to 
the Japanese markets but they want -- in accordance with the 
most-favored-nation clause of the GATT -- equal rights for 
everyone. They want to prevent disadvantages both in the 
Japanese and domestic markets that would result from bilateral 
Japanese concessions for the United States. 
  The European Commission is considering two kinds of actions 
to settle the transpacific conflict peacefully: The 
above-mentioned trialogue among the three major world trade 
partners, and comprehensive informative assistance for the 
enterprises to enable them to gain a foothold in the difficult 
Japanese import markets. The worldwide GATT agreement must be 
"utilized to the maximum extent by all partners in friendly 
cooperation," Brittan demanded. In any event, it must be 
prevented that strong "interest groups and the creators of 
markets" establish new trade barriers. Like the criticism by 
the general secretariat of the GATT, this is an indirect appeal 
to President Clinton to show fairness vis-a-vis all partners and 
to avoid a trade war. 
  Above all, the partners should vest greater direct powers in 
GATT for the settlement of trade disputes -- on a multilateral 
basis. Bilateral agreements, preferred by the United States, or 
more or less forced export restrictions undermine GATT as a 
multilateral world trade organizations.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD economic affairs expert Uwe Jens, by </F>
Rolf-Dietrich Schwartz; place and date not given: "`The Cake Has 
To Get Bigger'"] 
  [Text] After the economic resolutions at the Weisbadener 
party congress of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
in November 1993, party experts and the voters are waiting for 
the announced "financial framework" to pay for the demands. 
Rolf-Dietrich Schwartz, Bonn correspondent of the FRANKFURTER 
RUNDSCHAU, asked SPD economic expert Uwe Jens how the plans of 
the party's top people can be fulfilled "without making any 
promises that cannot be kept." 
  [Schwartz] Mr. Jens, you have difficulties in your own ranks 
with an initiative of the parliamentary group for more growth 
and employment. Why are there suddenly doubts about these 
classic demands of your party? 
  [Jens] I am certainly in agreement with the basic position 
of 
the party leaders that we should promise only what we can pay 
for. My motion, which is also supported by the financial, 
social, and economic politicians of my parliamentary group, is 
now held up in the SPD presidium and hopefully it can soon be 
debated once again in the parliamentary group. I am very much in 
favor of cooperation between the parliamentary group and the 
party, but naturally we must not let things get too bogged down. 
There is a need for discussion, because the fight against 
unemployment costs something. But we have also made some 
proposals on financing, among other things, the elimination of 
tax subsidies and the reduction of administrative hierarchies. 
  [Schwartz] Put simply: Would your party leaders have 
preferred to see the experts of your parliamentary group also 
suspend their work until the elections? 
  [Jens] Naturally I hope not. My economic motion was intended 
to force the Bundestag into a comprehensive debate. It is, after 
all, a specific formulation of our resolutions at the party 
congress. It aims at a national employment pact involving 
consolidation of state finances and lowering of the short-term 
Bundesbank interest rates, in which the parties in wage 
agreements would have to be satisfied with securing their real 
wages over a long time. It also includes an innovation offensive 
with favorable loans or subsidies for an ecological renewal of 
our national economy. Key words: development of remote heating 
and linkage with power plants. Support must be given to 
mid-level enterprises and to the provision of more risk capital. 
So there is enough for us to do when we form the government with 
our superior alternatives. 
  [Schwartz] Can that work without a specific financial 
framework for your extensive demands at the party congress? 
  [Jens] I am certainly in favor of us giving careful thought 
to how we can finance everything. Naturally an opposition cannot 
do that to the penny but it can do it in broad outlines as in my 
motion. Seen in macroeconomic terms, much pays for itself, as in 
the ecological renewal of our national economy, in which the 
stresses on the environment are to be made more costly through 
taxation and hence labor less expensive through the reduction of 
the supplemental wage costs. 
  [Schwartz] What do you say about the latest ideas in your 
party about using special-purpose loans to finance specific 
projects? 
  [Jens] I think that debt pots--and they also include loans 
of 
the most diverse kinds--to finance our tasks are virtually out 
of the question. Even now, if we include all secondary public 
budgets, we have a national debt amounting to about 66 percent 
of the gross national product. But only 60 percent would be 
permitted under the Maastricht stability criteria for entering 
the third stage of the European Monetary Union. In addition, 
rising state debt would only drive interest rates higher. 
  [Schwartz] So what remains for a serious opposition party 
with respect to latitude to finance its demands? 
  [Jens] There are only four possibilities: cuts in public and 
above all consumptive expenditures; tax increases; more debt; 
and more economic growth, the source of higher tax receipts. 
Thus, we must do everything we can to increase the size of the 
cake that can be divided up. That is the objective of all of our 
measures, which would therefore partially finance themselves. 
But naturally we must also give thought to a clear restriction 
of increases in public expenditures. There is also the 
introduction of the solidarity contribution that has already 
been decided by the Federal Government, from which small and 
medium incomes must be excluded, however. Not to be forgotten 
are the many tax loopholes, which must finally be plugged 
through more effective control. After all, it must not happen 
that individual federal laender are already using the argument 
of somewhat laxer taxation to attract enterprises. I say that 
the control of the revenue offices must be just as strict in 
southern Germany as in the north or the central part of our 
country.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Rainer Nahrendorf: "Lower the Employment </F>
Threshold"] 
  [Text] The Clinton Administration criticizes the failure of 
West Europeans to create new employment through new growth. This 
criticism, however, is only partly justified. Although the GNP 
of the United States grew by almost 3 percent in 1993, and 
although some 2 million jobs were created in 1993 and the 
unemployment rate, computed according to a new method, dropped 
to 6.7 percent in January, the much-praised U.S. "job machine" 
runs below capacity. 
  In the United States, as in Europe, for some time there has 
been discussion on economic growth without additional 
employment. The leverage of growth on employment is not as great 
by far as in former phases of upswing. The Institute of German 
Economy recently calculated that in the U.S. economy overall, 7 
percent growth of the GDP between 1991 and 1993 had brought 
about 3 percent more employment, while in the economic boom of 
1983-1985, a 14.6-percent growth rate had still yielded a 
9.6-percent employment increase. 
  The reason for growth without employment increase--which 
occurs primarily in industry--lies in the slimming down of U.S. 
enterprises, forced by tough international competition. This 
applies above all to the automobile industry, machine and 
systems building, and the electrical engineering industry. New 
jobs are being created primarily in the service sector, in 
software and engineering offices, in social services, and in 
low-paying jobs such as parking lot and movie attendants. U.S. 
Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich would like to counter the 
"slimming down strategy" of enterprises with a qualification 
strategy and a reintegration program for the growing number of 
long-term unemployed. 
<H5>  Millions of Exchange Proceedings </H5>
  Professor Dr. Horst Siebert, president of the Kiel Institute 
for World Economy, has furnished proof of the phenomenon of 
solidifying unemployment in the FRG. According to his 
calculations, the unemployment base (see HANDELSBLATT of 14 Dec 
1993) has grown by 700,000 and 830,000 persons, respectively, 
during the last two recessions. Siebert predicts that an 
economic upswing will hardly improve the situation on the labor 
market. For the period 1970 to 1989, Siebert has found that 
employment rose only if the growth rate of the GDP went above 
the 1.7 percent mark. 
  Even if economic growth were to approach 3 percent, it would 
not solve the problem of a solidifying unemployment. However, it 
is misleading to speak of an "unemployment base" rising with 
every cycle. Behind the unemployment figures, year after year 
there are movements into and out of unemployment by the 
millions. According to computations by the Federal Labor Office, 
in the course of 1993 there was a total of 6,574,300 unemployed. 
This number consists of those unemployed at the beginning of the 
year and those who became unemployede during the year. At the 
end of 1993, there was still a core of 2,513,700 unemployed. On 
the supply side, there is a similarly strong movement, albeit on 
a clearly lower level. 
  In 1992, the average unemployment period in western Germany 
came to 24.7 weeks. When employment problems grow overall, they 
hit older people considerably harder than younger ones. In 1993, 
the unemployment rate for younger people (up to 25 years of 
age), was 14.1 percent, while for older persons (50 to 65 years 
of age) it was 30.5 percent. 
  Although the number of long-term unemployed (one year or 
longer) in 1993 in western Germany reached its highest point 
since 1988 with 594,099, the ratio of the long-term unemployed 
at 26.2 percent remained constant compared to 1992 figures. 
<H5>  Costs Must Come Down </H5>
  Measures of an active labor market policy, such as promotion 
of extended occupational training, occupational rehabilitation, 
general job creation measures (ABM), and employment assistance 
for the long-term unemployed contribute considerably to 
countering structural discrepancies and improving the balance 
between supply and demand on the labor market. They ease the 
labor market, and build a bridge for many out of unemployment 
into jobs. This also applies to the employment promotion law 
which has facilitated the conclusion of time-limited employment 
contracts (see HANDELSBLATT of 16 Feb 1994). 
  But labor market policy measures and increased part-time 
work 
try to cure the symptoms of stagnating and decreasing employment 
rather than improving the preconditions for employment-intensive 
growth. The key to closing the workplace gap lies in improving 
the supply conditions in industry, in lowering costs, in tax and 
levy reductions, and a restrained wage policy better 
differentiated according to sectors, regions, and occupations. 
The Council of Experts, the research institutes and the German 
Bundesbank time and again have pointed out this correlation. 
  To the lack of differentiated wage structures are added 
inflexibilities and incrustations due to institutional 
regulations which also raise the entry threshold into the labor 
market. But above all it is important that wage agreements only 
regulate minimum standards and leave room for operational wage 
and salary differentiations, and working hour differentiations 
and flexibilities. The chemical industry wage agreement partners 
have provided a good example in their 1994 agreement, which 
provides for a 2 percent wage and salary increase with a 
three-month delay, expansion of the working-hours corridor, and 
entry level wages for the previously unemployed and first-time 
workers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bossi Tells The Knight: `Antitrust </F>
Measures Will Apply to You Too'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Despite their electoral agreement, [League 
Secretary] Bossi has never ceased making cutting remarks about 
[Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. However, he has never 
before touched his ally's most sensitive nerve -- namely, his 
broadcasting empire -- so closely and, moreover, riding one of 
Forza Italia's own white horses. In fact, speaking in the town 
of Varese, the League leader said: "I will be very interested 
to see how the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] -- who speaks so 
much of liberalism -- reacts to what we will be saying about 
antitrust measures, when the League addresses the problem of 
competition. Liberalism," Bossi went on to explain, "cannot 
entail dominant economic positions, and therefore I will be 
interested to hear what Berlusconi has to say when we call his 
TV networks into question." 
  In his Varese speech, however, Bossi did not limit himself 
to 
attacking Berlusconi's "treasures." He also accused Forza 
Italia, once again, of being an instrument created by the 
establishment to try to weaken the League. Despite this, Bossi 
did not seem to be afraid of contradicting himself by asserting 
that "if Forza Italia does not betray us in any way, we will 
make room for freedom even in a Catholic-communist country such 
as Italy, where liberalism has never before taken root." 
  In any case, the Senator [Bossi nickname] is convinced that 
the League will be successful within the liberal-democratic 
coalition. Therefore "Forza Italia," he said, "which was 
launched by the DC [Former Christian Democratic Party] to 
destroy the League, is being used by us to destroy what is left 
of the old Catholic party." "This is why we entered into an 
agreement, but this agreement is only an electoral one." 
  In order to permit his supporters to swallow the pill of 
being asked to vote indiscriminately for all the "liberty" 
lists, including Forza Italia, Bossi explained that, in 
single-member constituencies, where the choice is 
"unfortunately" compulsory, 70 percent of the candidates will, 
in any case, belong to the Bandwagon [League nickname], and only 
30 percent will be Berlusconi's associates. "However, in the 
proportional vote," the Lombard leader emphasized, "you will be 
able to choose your political force, namely the League, and will 
not be forced to vote for Forza Italia, which was set up to 
rescue the establishment."

<F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F>
Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "No Incongruous 
Groups After the Elections" --first paragraph is IL GIORNALE 
introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- A "constituent government," certainly not. 
The National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini rejects the 
proposition of an incongruous group to lead the country in 
advance. In this interview with IL GIORNALE, Fini again 
proposes presidentialism as the unifying theme of the 
antiprogressive alignment and gives [Northern League leader] 
Bossi a taste of his own medicine. 
  [Guiglia] The League leader continues to call you "a 
Fascist." Were you not allies? 
  [Fini] If I were Bossi, I would have to reproach him for his 
communist past which emerges each time he is in difficulty. 
Unless this explains the favor done to [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto each time that Bossi attacks the 
forces in the antiprogressive alignment. He can continue 
shouting. He will not succeed in dragging me down to his level. 
The National Alliance differs from the League in two concepts: 
national identity and solidarity, things that Bossi does not 
attribute any importance to. So much the worse for him. 
  [Guiglia] Do you also consider Forza Italia as being a party 
of "recycled people?" 
  [Fini] I consider [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi as being 
a 
businessman that has demonstrated great courage. He has the 
undeniable virtue of never having drawn from the coffers of 
state to balance the accounts. This explains why the Left 
prefers someone like [Fiat manager] Agnelli who resorts to 
state-subsidized layoffs. Forza Italia may have given 
hospitality to some survivors of the regime in its lists. But 
denying that it represents a positive novelty, once again means 
playing the game of the PDS-monopolized front. 
  [Guiglia] According to some people in the south, the 
Center-Right could also get some votes from the Mafia. What 
precautions have you taken to avoid such a risk? 
  [Fini] For the time being we should begin by remembering 
that 
this is the thesis of Pino Arlacchi, who was much better as a 
sociologist. Now he is a progressive candidate and must create 
some ridiculous propaganda about the adversaries. The professor 
seems to have suddenly forgotten that a high-ranking boss, such 
as Madonia, has spoken of dangerous links between the PCI 
[former Italian Communist Party] and work contracts. However, 
he must at least remember that in all the south the right is 
advancing precisely by setting itself against the criminal Mafia 
gangs. We have certainly not changed our minds about the Mafia 
and the Camorra [Neapolitan Mafia] by asking for sentences that 
not only set an example, but also without reductions or benefits. 
  [Guiglia] Do you see a "political solution" to the kickback 
scandal after the 27 March elections? 
  [Fini] Those wanting to wipe the slate clean would do well 
to 
vote for the National Alliance. Two things are needed in order 
to turn over a new leaf on thefts by the regime: trials and the 
restitution of the stolen money by those who have subtracted 
trillions [of lire] from the country. 
  [Guiglia] Do you still have faith in [Judge] Di Pietro or 
has 
the time come to change your mind after two years of "Clean 
Hands?" 
  [Fini] I have not changed my opinion. I trusted Di Pietro 
before and I trust him now. I am not surprised that Bossi has 
changed his mind after the misadventures that forced him to 
present himself in court. 
  [Guiglia] According to [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, the 
Center-Right cannot govern because it does not have a common 
program. What is your answer to the Pact for Italy leader? 
  [Fini] Segni is nothing but a character looking for an 
author. His transformation will not give Italy a government. I 
am convinced that the voters will give a strong and clear 
indication as to the majority in parliament. If this is not the 
case, it would be better to return to the polls after having 
modified the confused electoral law. The direct election of the 
head of government will also be the ground upon which a new 
government alliance will be created. There are no prospects for 
the anomalous coalitions proposed by [Italian Popular Party 
Veneto regional secretary] Bindi in the first legislature of the 
Second Republic. Goodbye to the old coalition projects which 
will not be missed. 
  [Guiglia] Goodbye to [President] Scalfaro as well? 
  [Fini] New parliament, new government, new rules of the 
game: 
Can an "old" president of the republic remain at the Quirinale 
[president palace]? 
  [Guiglia] What are the odds on the "return" of [former 
President] Cossiga? 
  [Fini] The former head of the government lost an opportunity 
and I am sorry. He gives the impression of living in a 
fully-submerged submarine when he should be putting up his 
periscope. 
  [Guiglia] The MSI [Italian Social Movement] has 34 
representatives: What is the threshold of success for the 
National Alliance? 
  [Fini] I am aiming at 100 representatives, but I will be 
happy with 70. Two years ago the Right was at 5.4 percent and 
it seemed a miracle. 
  [Guiglia] Speaking of miracles: In order to achieve the 
"Italian" miracle should debts be cut first or should we invest 
in employment first? 
  [Fini] The two priorities are not alternatives, they are 
complementary.

<F P=106> [Report by Giorgio Battistini, Gianluca Luzi: "Now Think, </F>
Italy"] 
  [Text] Rome -- "There is still a month to go before the 
general election, but I see that some people are already forming 
governments. I think we should wait and see who wins. We are 
committed to victory." There is talk about a "constituent 
government" after the elections, and [Democratic Party of the 
Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto has issued a warning and 
a challenge to [Italian Popular Party (PPI) Secretary] 
Martinazzoli and [Northern League leader] Bossi, who have been 
talking about it: First, the contest must take place, and the 
progressives want to win it in order to govern. So Occhetto 
wants to win, but victory is also the stated aim of the Pact for 
Italy which -- with [Pact leader] Segni, Martinazzoli, 
[Socialist] Amato, and [Italian Republican Party, PRI, 
Secretary] La Malfa -- instead risks playing the role of the 
preordained loser in this confrontation between the Right and 
the Left. 
  They are rivals. They goad each other, try to win over the 
same voters, and attack each other. But the real enemy, the 
main target of Segni's attacks, and also those of Occhetto and 
[Democratic Alliance, AD, leader] Adornato, is [Forza Italia 
leader] Silvio Berlusconi, the "Knight of the Antenna," as AD 
calls him. Contesting an election for the first time, both the 
Pact for Italy and AD (which presented their candidates and 
programs at two separate hotels in Rome) concentrated their 
attacks on Forza Italia's leader. 
  Thus Occhetto replied almost contemptuously to Berlusconi's 
proposal of another election if no clear majority emerges 28 
March: "Berlusconi is young, fresh, and full of life. Now he is 
involving himself in politics and therefore wants to have some 
fun right after the election so as to be able to broadcast more 
commercials." Then Occhetto abandoned his sarcasm: "For some 
time the citizens have thought that it is necessary to set to 
work, to produce, and to grant this country security. We hope 
that these citizens will find the strength to opt clearly for a 
majority that is willing to roll up its sleeves in order to 
rebuild Italy." 
  This appeal was expressed in the slogan, "Think, Italy," 
[Ragiona Italia] launched by AD yesterday, to counter 
Berlusconi's Forza Italia. "We must work for a thinking Italy 
against those who want to induce the sleep of reason which, as 
we know, creates monsters." This was said by Luigi Spaventa, a 
[budget] minister in the Ciampi government, and Berlusconi's 
challenger in central Rome, the symbolic constituency in these 
elections. 
  Seriousness versus demagoguery is the theme that AD and the 
progressives have identified as the key to the campaign against 
Berlusconi. According to Spaventa, Forza Italia's Right is 
exploiting the idea of a "mythical Wild West where men are men 
and the land belongs to everyone." The Right's electoral 
program is "intellectually and technically coarse," Spaventa 
said, as, for instance, in the plan to "create a million jobs by 
granting tax relief on reinvested profits" or with regard to the 
abolition of road tax. "This means depriving the regions of 
revenue," the budget minister stressed. "How does that square 
with a federal tax system?" 
  The Left is telling voters to beware of facile promises. 
"They are just promises, electoral demagoguery," Bruno 
Visentini said, flanking Spaventa. "The market economy is not a 
natural phenomenon but a complex one requiring rules, and it 
must therefore be subject to discipline," the former Republican 
minister warned. "And a million new jobs cannot result from a 
wave of a magic wand." "Demagogic promises" and the request for 
"blank checks," Visentini said, "are historically the prelude to 
authoritarianism," to a Right "that longs for the return of the 
night stick." So according to Visentini, a vote for the Right 
entails "a real leap in the dark." 
  Segni's Pact for Italy also takes issue with the Left, of 
course, but its main target remains Berlusconi. What if Forza 
Italia promises lower taxes? Those are "rash promises," Segni 
said, recalling the warning issued by Governor of the Bank of 
Italy Antonio Fazio. "To promise a major reduction in the tax 
burden means to forget about the problem of the public debt. 
These proposals are simply demagogic and inopportune." The 
Pact's pledge, Segni said, is "not to increase taxes. It is 
through reducing tax evasion and the public debt that a lowering 
of tax rates will be possible." As for a million jobs in three 
months -- "not even with a magic wand...." 
  Rather, the Pact leader said, "it is surprising that Forza 
Italia's program says nothing about the media. For our part, 
the duopoly in television must be eliminated, though the public 
presence must be maintained, albeit cut back in some areas." 
Basically, "it is necessary to ensure a greater private 
presence through a modification of the Mammi Bill. It is not 
possible for all private information to be entrusted to a single 
individual." 
  Martinazzoli, in a mood for witticisms, made a remark about 
"promises of miracles," which are always easy during an election 
campaign. "Vote for the Right once, take three," he said, with 
reference to the cross-party alliance between Bossi, Berlusconi, 
and [Italian Social Movement (MSI) leader] Fini. He also spoke 
about Bossi's "year of the Samurai," which has become "the month 
of delirium." "However," the Italian Popular Party leader said, 
"miracles rarely occur in politics, and so ultimately it will be 
necessary to sum up all these subtractions and additions -- less 
tax, more consumption, more order and money for justice. I hope 
that the Italian people will not be prompted to support promises 
that then immediately backfire against them." However, the 
possibility of a constituent government still remains. "My 
idea," he explained, "is that if none of the alignments gains a 
majority, it will be necessary to establish not so much just any 
kind of government but, rather, a government capable of 
governing authoritatively in a period which is still to a large 
extent a constituent one."

<F P=106> [Silvio Buzzanca report: "Napolitano Attacks Forza Italia: </F>
`Demagogic and Untrustworthy'"] 
  [Text] "Evasive," "demagogic," "clumsy," "parochial," 
"irresponsible." These are some of the adjectives that lower 
house speaker Giorgio Napolitano used yesterday morning [2 
March] at his press conference for foreign journalists, during 
which he took stock of the 11th Parliament. The adjectives 
apparently had only one target -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi and his electoral program. 
  Napolitano, speaking in the same forum from which Berlusconi 
made one of his first political speeches, urged all the forces 
to display "a sense of responsibility" and an "awareness of 
Italy's international responsibilities," avoiding "clumsy 
provincialism." He went on: "Judging from Forza Italia's 
lengthy program, it seems that not everyone remembers the 
pledges made in Maastricht, our cooperative relations with the 
IMF, and the objectives approved by parliament in its most 
recent budget deliberations." Furthermore, the lower house 
speaker added, there is a lack of clarity "about public finance 
reform and how to reduce the state debt." 
  These missing elements prompted Napolitano to say: "You 
cannot make proposals, however questionable and fragmentary, 
with regard to taxation and public spending and not say 
something about the framework of objectives and obligations for 
public finance reform." The lower house speaker said that these 
obligations and objectives must be honored, "otherwise the 
result will be a lapse into the demagogic, the evasive, the 
untrustworthy." 
  Napolitano perceived another strange omission in Forza 
Italia's program: "I am amazed that Forza Italia's program does 
not include any reference to the media; it is evidently believed 
that everything is perfect in this sector in Italy." According 
to the lower house speaker, the present situation is on the 
contrary not at all satisfactory: Indeed, he expressed the hope 
that one of the new parliament's first steps will be to revise 
the Mammi Bill. 
  Napolitano said that "it is parochial to ignore the analysis 
and debate that Europe's governments and political and cultural 
forces have been conducting for some time on issues such as 
industrial policies and how to boost the economy, especially 
employment." He pointed out that work is ongoing for these 
issues in Spain, Germany, and France, and cited the white paper 
presented by European Commission President Delors. 
  His argument seemed like a direct response to Berlusconi's 
promise to create a million jobs. The lower house speaker 
explained that to dismiss everything "as statism means 
reinstating old ideological disputes; it is an example of clumsy 
parochialism." He added: "It is quite simply irresponsible to 
put forward vague liberalist recipes for resolving the problems 
of unemployment." 
  Napolitano never named Berlusconi. He later explained that 
his remarks should be interpreted not as an attack on Berlusconi 
but as "an attempt to "stimulate a debate and, if necessary, a 
controversy over matters of substance, over programs, and not 
the mutual attaching of labels between the political forces at 
play." [quotation marks as published] 
  Precisely in order to avert any institutional controversies, 
Napolitano indeed did not answer a question concerning the 
debate prompted by [President] Scalfaro's remarks about private 
education. 
  There was a prompt response from Arcore [Berlusconi 
residence], from Berlusconi's spokesman, Antonio Tajani. Forza 
Italia accused the lower house speaker of abusing his 
institutional position to make "slanderous accusations against 
Forza Italia." According to the Berlusconi supporters, 
Napolitano's remarks, which are linked to [Italian Popular Party 
Secretary] Martinazzoli's attacks, smack of the "historical 
compromise." 
  During his press conference Napolitano formed a positive 
assessment of parliament's work, and urged people to draw a 
distinction between this and the judicial status of some of its 
members. He also said that he opposes an amnesty in order to 
resolve the kickbacks scandals, adding that he considers a 
resumption of the debate on the latest proposals made by Justice 
Minister Conso a possibility. 
  But he was most anxious to stress that "some people would 
have us believe that it is possible to govern tomorrow starting 
from scratch." Napolitano warned, however, that "only 
proceeding from the results of the 11th Parliament is it 
feasible to initiate a program of development." According to 
the lower house speaker, the next parliament (and, he specified, 
not the government) will be a "constituent" one. This, he 
concluded, is because it is not reasonable to discard the work 
done by the Bicameral committee on institutional reforms.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta </F>
by Roberto Petrini in Rome; date not given: "Exporting Is Good, 
Investing Is Better"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Paolo Baratta has experienced the golden 
months during which our exports have galloped ahead from the 
best vantage point, that of minister of foreign trade. 
Throughout 1993 the figures arriving on his desk bore witness 
to booming sales of our products on foreign markets. The 
overall result, in provisional figures released by the Bank of 
Italy on Monday [28 February], was a positive balance of 50 
trillion lire compared with just 3.8 trillion in 1992. 
Economist, banker, and minister in charge of privatization in 
the Amato government, Paolo Baratta is particularly attentive to 
the manufacturing sector, where the recovery should take root; 
an approach which inspires a sense of prudence in him. "Exports 
have grown, but there are obstacles to be overcome and there are 
still knots which must be untied," he explained, seated in his 
office. "There will certainly be a recovery, there should be no 
doubt of this," he adds, but implies that it will not be plain 
sailing. 
  [Petrini] Minister Baratta, our exports are doing extremely 
well, and shouts of enthusiasm are coming from every quarter. 
Are we already out of the trough; are we a country unafraid of 
rivals on its international markets? 
  [Baratta] We must be very careful not to interpret this data 
with unwarranted optimism. Let us understand each other: The 
figures are extremely positive and we are very satisfied. 
However, if we look at Italy's market shares in the 
industrialized countries, we realize that these have not grown: 
In the United States, we have remained at around 2.4 percent, 
in France, we have fallen from 11.8 percent in 1992 to 9.8 
percent in the first 11 months of 1993. In Germany we have 
fallen from 9.7 to 7.8 percent, and in Japan from 1.8 to 1.6 
percent. On our markets, we have still not returned to our 1987 
shares. In short, we have increased volume, but this has not 
served to increase our penetration on Western markets. The 
opposite, however, is true for the Far East, and in general for 
all newly industrialized countries, where we have seen a real 
and genuine boom. 
  [Petrini] Does this mean that the export boom could be 
short-lived? 
  [Baratta] The danger exists. The fact is that the failure to 
enlarge our market shares may be because the effects of the lira 
devaluation have not yet completely worked through. If this was 
the reason, there would be no need to worry, but would mean that 
we still have large margins to take advantage of. However, 
there is also another hypothesis: that our penetration of 
wealthy and developed markets is not as easy because we still 
have problems of competitiveness, of technology, and of the 
organizational structures of our companies. 
  [Petrini] Is our production system able to consolidate our 
presence abroad? 
  [Baratta] It is here that we win or lose. There are certain 
factors which allow us to be optimistic. Our businesses, and in 
particular the small and medium-sized ones, have demonstrated an 
extraordinary liveliness, the "animal spirits" [words in 
English] are there. But we have to act politically in order to 
achieve industrial development within the new framework of 
international competition: We have to be prepared to invest 
many more resources in new products, in research and in the 
human factor. We need to invest more in helping Italian 
companies access the new markets. 
  [Petrini] What do our entrepreneurs need to do to ensure 
that 
the 1993 boom is not wasted? 
  [Baratta] They need to work on enlarging their markets. Move 
to conquer international demand which is growing, even if very 
far from home. They need to draw the correct lessons from the 
devaluation: This is not a chance event, but a stimulus for 
getting reorganized, for acquiring better technical structures 
domestically and better sales structures abroad. 
  [Petrini] The lira devaluation has been pointed to as the 
key 
factor in the upward movement of our exports. Is this true? 
  [Baratta] Yes, the devaluation has had a major impact. But I 
would not want to overlook the fact that, in recent years, 
demand from newly industrialized countries has increased. The 
fact is that the upward movement in our exports predates the 
devaluation. Moreover, I would not overlook the agreement on the 
labor costs which has allowed us to contain the growth of 
internal costs. 
  [Petrini] Industrial production has picked up in the last 
three months, exports are moving ahead, and internal costs have 
been contained. Are these the preconditions for our economy 
taking off? 
  [Baratta] No, these conditions are not enough. We need to 
take advantage of all the opportunities which the foreign 
markets offer. We need therefore to continue to secure 
international credibility, financial stability, low interest 
rates. We also need a very tough approach to the management of 
public finances, in order to have resources available for the 
numerous actions which are a necessary part of a medium-term 
policy of supporting public and private investments. In 
addition, we need to reduce, as soon as possible, taxation on 
companies, bringing it down to the levels of the most favored 
European partners. 
  [Petrini] In short, for you the recovery is not then just 
round the corner. Is this right? 
  [Baratta] One can say that signs of recovery exist. We can 
say that we are really in an economic recovery when we see new 
investment decisions. It is certain that the recovery will 
come, but it is too early to say when and how. 
  [Petrini] You say that small companies are reacting well; 
however, there remains the question of the major industrial 
sectors, of chemicals and steel making. Can the old apparatus 
of previous state intervention contribute to the recovery? 
  [Baratta] The newly privatized industries are in certain 
cases less interested in exporting. Nonetheless, in this world 
we have seen a genuine revolution in behavior, a revolution 
which in fact has sidelined statism as a way of being and 
thinking. Since the summer of 1992, when the state said that it 
would not put one lira more of equity into public industry, we 
have seen a profound "privatization" of behavior. And in the 
world of the newly-privatized companies, new managers are 
growing up who, in a few years time, will provide us with 
positive surprises. 
  [Petrini] And are the major private groups ready? 
  [Baratta] In the last two years there has been a major 
tightening up coinciding with the European single market. It is 
no longer possible to have a little reserve in public contracts, 
and the idea that production can be protected by national 
legislation has disappeared. Special attention or protection is 
no longer available. This too has been a revolution.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Eugenio Scalfari: "The Inflation Party"] </F>
  [Text] The American economy is well on its way to recovery, 
and this is a good thing for all industrial countries. The U.S. 
GDP is growing at the rate of 3 percent per year, but in the 
last quarter of 1993 the rate of increase rose to 7.50 percent 
-- a record for at least the past 10 years. Exports, 
investments, and consumer spending, especially of cars and 
durable goods, are rising; and moreover the real estate sector 
-- which is the driving force behind the entire American economy 
-- has made a dramatic recovery, with a growth of 31 percent in 
the last quarter of the year. 
  In other words, there is a boom reminiscent of the Reagan 
era, but achieved by means of an economic policy that is the 
exact opposite of Reagan's. This fact deserves to be pondered 
by the grandsons of the old cowboy who became U.S. President, 
rewarded the prosperous America, and bequeathed to the world the 
longest and toughest recession ever since the great crisis of 
1929. 
  As we said, the U.S. economic recovery is a tonic to the 
entire world: The dollar is rising, and so too is the tendency 
of American consumers to purchase foreign products, to invest 
abroad, and to travel abroad. In this way the market mechanisms 
gradually tend to distribute wealth also to countries distant 
from the stimulus center; and thus the U.S. locomotive is 
starting to pull along the cars of the long and varied 
international train. 
  But this positive process is by no means automatic, much 
less 
universal. Some of the cars have had their brakes applied or 
are applying them, others are falling apart, and still others 
are actually out of service, lying abandoned on sidings which 
they are very likely incapable of leaving in order to join the 
train of recovery. All the Third World countries, including the 
once flourishing oil producers, lie abandoned on these sidings. 
  Their bargaining power is now a distant memory, the rise of 
the dollar is proportionate to the fall in the price of crude; 
the Gulf War sealed the demise of the cartel of great Arab oil 
producers. 
  Nevertheless, this is the Third World's special area. In 
other very extensive areas -- the Maghreb, Black Africa, a large 
part of India and Southeast Asia, and almost the whole of Latin 
America -- the wind of recovery is not felt even as a light 
breeze. The cloak of poverty, hunger, and starvation is 
combined with very high birth rates and is driving increasing 
masses of poor toward the wealthy metropolises. There no cars 
rejoin powerful locomotives; there is only despair and 
subhumanity; the market is a meaningless word, and hope is only 
a chimera. 
  Among the stationary cars, which will get going again sooner 
or later and perhaps return to being locomotives themselves, the 
two most deserving of attention are Japan and Germany. A 
thorough examination of them would be beyond the scope of these 
observations, and has in any case been carried out several times 
in this paper. However, there is one important factor in part 
shared by these two major economic powers that explains their 
present crisis: In both the mechanism of accumulation has broken 
down. So this is no mere passing crisis but something 
different, more profound, more structural. 
  In Japan what has broken down is the model of development in 
which enterprises constituted not only the locomotive of 
production but also the social and cultural locomotive. There 
has been a breakdown in entrepreneurial monolithism, 
monoculture, the Japanization of Japan (if I may be permitted to 
use the term). The picture of workers arriving at the factory 
singing the national anthem and performing martial gymnastics is 
now a memory; another distant memory is the submissiveness of 
the trade unions, and yet another is the close associations of 
the industrial groups, both among themselves and with the major 
banking groups. 
  In other words, Japanese capitalism is becoming 
Americanized, 
nor could it have been otherwise; but it is thus losing part of 
its influence, while its accumulation mechanism is growing 
weaker. Japanese protectionism still stands, but American 
pressure is becoming increasingly vigorous, and sooner or later 
some breaches will be opened. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese power is marking time and watching 
the reawakening of the Chinese giant with an interest not 
without apprehension. At the start of the third millennium, 
this part of the planet will witness events that we cannot now 
even imagine. 
  To talk about Germany entails talking about Europe, that is, 
about home. 
  Here, too, development has broken down as a result not only 
of short-term causes but also of structural causes. There are 
three such causes: Germany has found its own developing area in 
the east Laender, and the encounter has been traumatic at times; 
the government has been either unwilling or unable to meet the 
costs of unification by physically drawing revenue from a share 
of the income of the west Laender and the more prosperous 
classes; the power of the banks has compensated for this by 
keeping real interest rates high. 
  These three social and political factors have combined 
with the world recession that has penalized German exports and 
caused internal liquidity to increase. In order to absorb it, 
or at least to contain it, the Bundesbank is again turning 
toward a more restrictive credit policy, after some, albeit 
timid, signs of recovery in recent months. 
  All this is coinciding with the very recent rise in American 
interest rates. The immediate effect has been apparent in the 
past few days in all the world's financial markets: Shares are 
falling, yield from bonds is rising, and savers are again 
preferring short-term rather than long-term investments, thus 
worsening the conditions on which governments can secure credit 
from the capital market. 
  The American recovery is a good thing for everyone, as I 
said 
at the beginning. Nevertheless, there are some countries which, 
for various reasons, are slow to join that locomotive. However, 
in order to preserve its recovery without feeding inflation, the 
United States is raising the cost of money, with a domino 
effect. Those lagging behind do not yet enjoy the benefits of 
the economic situation but immediately feel the pinch of more 
expensive money. 
  In this quandary, within this pincer, so to speak, some 
problems are also being experienced with the lira exchange rate, 
the prices of government stock, and the cost of the public debt. 
For the present these are not real phenomena but, rather, 
expectations: Italian savers expect that the yield on their 
bonds will rise and that the cost of the public debt again will 
rise after a long period of decline. Hence the weakness of 
foreign exchange and of 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year treasury 
bonds. 
  There is no cause for excessive alarm; these are at present 
smoke signals, and no more; the pre-electoral situation is 
exaggerating their extent. 
  The promise to reduce fiscal pressure, for instance, comes 
at 
a most inopportune time, as is amply demonstrated by our 
foregoing analysis. For that matter, the governor of the Bank 
of Italy, with the authority that he enjoys by virtue of that 
position, reached the same conclusions just the other day. It 
is true that [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi immediately 
accused him of being a conservative. What a reversal: Now the 
leader of the conservatives is labeling himself a progressive 
compared to someone who deems his promise of tax reductions 
demagogic! 
  Of course, the burden of taxation could be reduced somewhat 
if spending were to be further contained and the deficit were to 
be confined to the projected 144 trillion lire. However, this 
presupposes that the cost of the public debt will not rise 
again. Will this happen? The recent events that we have 
recalled raise serious doubts in this regard. 
  As though this were not enough, the right's economic program 
envisages various production incentives (in the automobile and 
housing sectors) and larger spending allocations for several 
ministries, starting with Justice and Defense. Last, we learned 
yesterday that the entire center-right bloc is in favor of the 
proposal made by the pope and [President] Scalfaro for major 
state subsidies for private -- that is, Catholic -- schools. 
  To sum up: Greater expenditure, lower taxation, a presumable 
increase in the cost of the public debt; if this is the economic 
program of the right, the sole possible consequence is an 
increase in the deficit, further increasing the debt. 
  In fact what lies behind this program is simply a renewed 
rise in inflation, a result greatly desired by all those who 
have major debts with the banks, but greatly feared by all 
citizens who have loaned the state part of their savings. 
  These home-grown proponents of economic deregulation hate 
the 
state, but want to continue using it as a cash cow whenever 
their own vested interests are at stake. Now they even want it 
to subsidize church schools. But did they not say, "less state, 
more market?" Does this watchword not apply to education? 
  As for tax pressure, it will remain the same, but the 
distribution of its burden on the various sectors will change. 
We already know that the program of the "pole for freedoms" 
includes the abolition of the minimum tax and 30 percent income 
tax for all. Yesterday we published a very eloquent table that 
highlights the effects of this proposed reform: Those earning 
up to 80 million lire a year will pay more, and those earning 
more than 100 million lire a year will pay less. 
  Gentlemen, you could not have been clearer. Long live 
freedom, don Giovanni sings. His own freedom, that is, of 
course; already owning a fortune in Spain, he evidently wants 
much more.

  [Excerpt] Now let's turn once again to crime news. The 
number of factories set up by the Mafia to refine heroin in 
Sicily is much larger than first thought. The news was 
disclosed by the accused in a heroin-processing trial at the 
fortified courtroom-bunker in Rome's Rebibbia Prison. A heroin 
refinery in the area near Trapani was the largest ever uncovered 
in Europe. Gianfranco D'Anna reports. 
  [D'Anna] During the 1980s from Palermo to Trapani every 
Mafia 
clan ran a heroin refinery; a flood of drugs was exported to 
every European capital and to North America. In the underground 
network of hidden refineries in the areas around Palermo and 
Trapani, there are at least 40 well-organized clans, but so far 
only five of these clans have been discovered; four in Palermo 
and another, which is considered to be the most sophisticated 
and dangerous, in Alcamo. 
  Totuccio Contorno, Rosario Spatola, Fabio Savone, and all 
the 
other informers who are being questioned in the fortified 
courtroom-bunker in Rebbibia Prison by Trapani judges, have 
stressed how enourmously important the refinery of death at 
Virgini in the suburbs of Alcamo is to the Mafia. In its few 
months of activity, the refinery produced 1,200 kg of heroin and 
was still carrying on with its processing operations when an 
additional 400 kg were discovered. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The inistry of Post and Telecommunications has 
intervened in the jungle that is the Italian broadcast system. 
Hundreds of televison broadcasts, which are operating illegally 
will be switched off. Among these is Antenna Taranto Sei [local 
television channel broadcasting in Taranto, southern Italy], 
which is owned by the Mayor of Taranto Giancarlo Cito, who was 
elected to the post thanks to the political broadcasts he made 
on his television station. Cito has been excluded [from 
televison ownership] because of previous convictions: 
  [Correspondent Salvatore Capatano] Antenna Taranto Sei 
[AT6], 
the television channel that helped Cito to the most important 
post in the city, is carrying on broadcasting as though nothing 
has happened, although Maurizio Pagani, the telecommunications 
minister has refused to grant the Taranto-based televison 
station a frequency because it did not abide by the official 
regulations. The minister's decree has been in force since 28 
February, but the frequency is still being used by AT6, which 
says it has not received a decree or official notification of 
such a decree. However, the station does know about the media 
ombudsman's reprimand, which particularly refers to a broadcast 
of 4 December [1993] -- the eve of the local council election. 
On that date, AT6 repeatedly broadcast a program that the 
ombudsman called propaganda. The expulsion of AT6 from the list 
of television stations authorized to transmit in the city of 
Taranto and its province is due, according to some sources, to 
the previous convictions of the owner.

  [Text] Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso 
is visiting South Africa, but is thinking about Angola. The 
foreign minister told us that the Lusaka agreement is 
technically ready, but it has not been signed yet because there 
is no political will: 
  [Begin recording] [Durao Barroso] From a technical point of 
view, the documents are at a rather advanced stage. I met 
moments ago with a representative of the negotiating team who 
confirmed that news. The fundamental problem is whether there 
is the will on either side for a true national reconciliation 
agreement to be signed. 
  [Correspondent Carlos Pacheco] But does this [the will] 
exist 
or not? 
  [Barroso] So far it has not existed. 
  [Pacheco] And, according to what you have just said, what 
will be the logical outcome of the Lusaka negotiations? 
  [Barroso] Well, a logical outcome would be a positive 
conclusion, but that will obviously be subject to a political 
rectification, at the highest level, from both sides. I cannot 
foresee it at the moment. 
  [Pacheco] Do the conditions exist for that to happen? 
  [Barroso] At the same time as there has been progress at the 
Lusaka talks, the fact is that the situation has been worsening 
on the ground. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Durao Barroso talking to our correspondent.

for four hours: 
  [Paula Colaco] Last night was an agitated one in Prior 
Velho. 
One dead and three injured policemen are the results of four 
hours of shooting and stone throwing between the Republican 
Guards and some 400 people of African origin. It all started in 
a cafe, where the residents of the Quinta da Serra shantytown 
usually meet. 
  According to the Republican Guards, the disturbances started 
at about 2000 [2100 GMT], when the cafe owner ordered a 
misbehaving couple to leave. The couple refused to leave the 
premises and the incident developed from there. 
  But some of those present tell a different story: 
  [Begin recording unidentified Cape Verdean witness] The 
couple was doing nothing. We were watching football on TV. The 
boy was sitting and the girl was sitting on his lap. [end

  For the present, the cafe owner is under arrest, but the 
Quinta da Serra residents are threatening to take justice into 
their own hands. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Ole Bang Nielsen "Background" article: "Nordic Block Vote </F>
Possible"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- If the other three Nordic countries 
become members of the EU [European Union], from 1995 the Nordic 
countries will have a total voting strength in the Council of 
Ministers corresponding to 15 percent. 
  This is not enough for the Nordic countries alone to be able 
to block EU proposals which run counter to Nordic interests -- 
for that 70 percent of votes would be needed -- but it does mean 
that the Nordic countries could represent a power factor 
together with other EU countries in areas such as environmental 
policy, consumer policy, and on the question of free trade. 
  Denmark has had difficulty in promoting the stated Danish 
interest in high standards in the environmental and consumer 
fields -- as demonstrated most recently in connection with 
issues such as the EU's directive on the recycling of packaging 
materials and the directive on food additives. Hitherto 
Denmark, together with the Netherlands and Germany, has formed a 
block vote in the Council of Ministers and has fought for higher 
environmental standards. But the three countries have not had 
enough votes to stand firm on this policy. With votes from 
Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Norway -- which are expected to 
pursue a similar environmental policy line in the EU -- a solid 
block has now been created that could at least block proposed 
directives that are designed to water down environmental policy. 
  But apart from in the environmental field it is at present 
difficult to see how the admission of the new members could 
alter the balance in the Council of Ministers. 
  Yesterday Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen (Radical 
Liberal) himself mentioned environmental policy as an important 
area for Nordic cooperation. 
  "There is a core of issues on which the Nordic countries 
have 
a common stance," he said. He also mentioned the question of 
greater openness in EU cooperation and the prospect of increased 
cooperation with the countries of East Europe. 
  "In the case of East Europe I see a real possibility of 
close 
Nordic cooperation involving new initiatives that could benefit 
the East Europeans." Niels Helveg Petersen takes the view that 
the Nordic countries have a shared desire and a common interest 
in getting the East Europeans linked to the EU as swiftly as 
possible. 
  "But there is the prospect of other openings in the field of 
security and foreign policy, and along with all this comes the 
prospect that the Nordic area will have a common foreign policy 
through the EU," Niels Helveg Petersen pointed out. Since World 
War II the Nordic countries have gone their separate ways in the 
field of security policy. Denmark and Norway have been members 
of NATO, for the last 22 years Denmark has also been a member of 
the EU, Sweden has been neutral, while up to the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, Finland had forced on it a neutrality that mostly 
satisfied Soviet interests. 
  In the economic field, however, there are doubts about the 
creation of a Nordic block vote. In the agricultural field 
Denmark's interests run directly counter to those of the other 
Nordic countries, and it is also doubtful whether the potential 
new members will back the liberal trade line that Denmark has 
traditionally pursued in the EU.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Nyrup Rasmussen Confident of </F>
Norwegian Membership"] 
  [Excerpt] Copenhagen -- Prime Minister Poul Nyrup 
Rasmussen (Social Democratic Party) was happy when it was 
announced yesterday that Sweden had reached agreement with the 
EU [European Union] in its membership negotiations. It was a 
piece of good news that also boosted the prime minister's 
optimism about successfully concluding Norway's membership 
negotiations. 
  "This is pleasing. Now I hope we will see rapid progress and 
a solution for all four countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and 
Austria -- editorial note) within a few days. 
  ``It is of crucial importance that the negotiating tempo is 
maintained and that all four countries achieve a result. I 
believe that Norway will also achieve a solution,'' the prime 
minister said. 
  Shortly before, at his weekly meeting with the press at 
Christiansborg, he had stressed that it is of crucial importance 
that the negotiations should succeed. 
  "The words `collapse of the negotiations' do not exist in 
our 
dictionary. They will succeed. For the sake of the Nordic 
countries, for the sake of the EU, and against the background of 
the future enlargement negotiations with the countries of East 
Europe," he said. 
  The prime minister said that he would like to see more 
flexibility in the enlargement negotiations on the part of Spain. 
  "It is necessary that Spain too should understand the 
consideration that must be given to the Norwegian fish stocks. 
If the political will exists, the question can be resolved," 
the prime minister said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The alcohol monopoly in the form of AB Vin och 
Sprit's [import and wholesale] monopoly will disappear, but 
Systembolaget [state retail monopoly] will remain. 
  Cigarettes and beer will be more expensive. In a year tax on 
cigarettes will be at the EU [European Union] level, and in 
three years beer will reach EU tax levels. 
  Animal protection against salmonella, hog cholera, and mad 
cow disease will continue to be strict in Sweden. Border 
controls will be replaced by checks on exporters abroad and 
special certificates. 
  The trade unions will have influence on EU legislation 
through collective agreements in Sweden. 
  Security policy. There are no legal obstacles to Sweden and 
the EU having a common foreign and security policy, Sweden 
states in a declaration. 
  Sweden, Norway, and Finland can retain free trade with the 
Baltic region. 
  Influence in the decisionmaking bodies is not fully clear. 
Sweden wants five votes in the Council of Ministers, while the 
EU wants to give four. Sweden wants 25 seats in the European 
Parliament, while the EU wants to give 21. 
  Import quotas on clothes will be reintroduced. The EU has 
promised that quotas will correspond to today's level of 
imports, but clothes prices could rise. 
  Sweden's tough environmental standards can stay in place for 
four years in those cases where they are stricter than those of 
the EU. However, the EU has undertaken to review its own 
regulations. 
  Financial support for Norrland will be replaced by the EU's 
support to mountain agriculture and normal agricultural support 
for disadvantaged regions. In addition the provinces concerned 
can receive environmental support and money from the structural 
fund for agricultural areas. 
  The freedom of information principle will remain. A 
declaration which has yet to be finalized will state that Sweden 
has the right to decide its freedom of information rules for 
itself. 
  The Swedes can keep their snuff. But it may only be 
manufactured and sold inside the country's borders. 
  Swedes will have a duty-free allowance of 1 liter of strong 
spirits or 3 liters of fortified wine, 5 liters of wine, 15 
liters of beer, and 300 cigarettes. 
  After a 5-year transitional period there will in principle 
be 
no obstacles to EU citizens buying summer cottages in Sweden. 
  In a year value-added tax will be payable on visits to the 
movie theater. However, there will be no value-added tax on 
other cultural events, sporting events, and prescription 
medicines. 
  Sweden's membership contribution will be 450 million kronor 
in 1995, 1,350 million in 1996, 5,850 million in 1997, 6,300 
million in 1998, and 6,750 million in 1999.

<F P=106> [Ingrid Hedstrom report: "Agreement on Three Heavyweight </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- "This is an agreement that can give us 
a yes in the Swedish referendum on EU membership." 
  So said European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel 
confidently 
when he made public the agreement he reached yesterday with the 
12 EU countries in Brussels. 
  "The agreement is a very good base for the referendum," Ulf 
Dinkelspiel said. 
  "With a real effort from the yes side and with the 
involvement of all those who want Sweden to join the EU, I am 
convinced that the result will be a yes." 
  Three heavyweight issues in the negotiations were settled 
during the weekend's and Monday [28 February] morning's marathon 
session: the budget, agriculture, and regional policy. 
  On the budget question, the main stumbling block in the 
final 
round of negotiations, there was a half victory for Sweden: 
  "We asked to be let off paying ECU2,000 million for five 
years. The result is ECU1,025 million," Finance Minister Anne 
Wibble said. 
  What Sweden was demanding was a reduced EU membership fee 
for 
the initial years of Swedish EU membership. In the first year 
Anne Wibble wanted to give to Brussels as much money as the EU 
paid out to Sweden in the form of agricultural and regional 
support and so on -- that is, a zero net payment. After that 
the sum would gradually increase. 
  At first the EU rejected the Swedish demand but later 
softened its stance step-by-step. However, it did say a blank 
no to the principle of reduced membership contributions. 
Instead the EU will put money directly into Sweden's state 
coffers. But it is unclear what this money will be called, what 
it will say on the payment advice to Anne Wibble. 
  This means that in the first year of EU membership Sweden 
will pay a net sum of 450,000 kronor [SKr] to Brussels. After 
that net inpayments will increase rapidly. 
  The EU's first offer on the budget came on Saturday [26 
February]. It was improved on Sunday night. When Monday 
dawned, ECU125 million divided the Swedish and EU positions. 
Then the EU threw in a final ECU60 million, an offer that 
Sweden accepted. 
  The heavyweight agricultural negotiations did not get going 
in earnest until Sunday night. But Agriculture Minister Karl 
Erik Olsson declared himself to be largely satisfied with the 
final result: 
  "Highest on my list of priorities was preserving the high 
quality of Swedish food without an increased risk of disease and 
contamination," he said. 
  "Here we more or less hit the jackpot. The Swedish people 
need have no fears about poorer food quality even though imports 
of foodstuffs will increase," the agriculture minister said, 
referring in part to the agreement on protection against 
salmonella that was finalized on Sunday. 
  The second matter close to Karl Erik Olsson's heart was 
support for Norrland's agriculture that today receives almost 
SKr1 billion a year in additional state support. The Swedish 
negotiators wanted the EU to approve the principle of additional 
support for northern agriculture and also agree to share the 
financial burden. 
  The green light was given to the principle itself. The EU 
has approved Norrland support for the whole of the Swedish 
support region as far south as Dalsland. In actual fact the 
support is supposed to be paid north of the 62d parallel, but 
Karl Erik Olsson noted contentedly that "the 62d parallel runs a 
long way south of the 61st parallel here." 
  But the Swedish state itself will have to finance Norrland 
support. The EU said no to opening its pocketbook. 
  Nevertheless Norrland's farmers can count on quite a lot of 
EU money -- in part in the form of the EU's so-called LFA 
support for less-favored areas that could give Sweden a total of 
around SKr350 million a year from Brussels. In addition the EU 
will also pay Sweden SKr1.5 billion per year from its new 
farming environmental program -- money that can be spent on 
solving the problems of northern Sweden in particular, the 
agriculture minister said. 
  Karl Erik Olsson was less satisfied with the result of the 
negotiations when it comes to the important questions of 
production quotas for Swedish agriculture. Both the milk and 
sugar quotas were smaller than Sweden had demanded, even though 
the EU improved its offer on the last lap of the negotiations. 
  Sweden will receive SKr2.4 billion per year for five years 
in 
regional support for the EU's structural funds. Of these, 360 
million will go to Objective 6 -- the new support for sparsely 
populated regions that the EU created specifically for northern 
Scandinavia. The Objective 6 region covers parts of Norrbotten, 
Vasterbotten, Jamtland, Vasternorrland, and Kopparberg 
provinces, and Torsby local authority in Varmland and Ljusdal 
local authority in Gavleborg. 
  "We have succeeded in the task of creating an understanding 
of our country's special character with its sparse population 
and long distances," Labor Minister Borje Hornlund said. 
  The rest of the structural fund money will be shared between 
EU's Objective 2, 3, 4, and 5b regions. This means that it will 
go to industrial areas in decline, measures to counter youth 
unemployment, measures to prevent unemployment, and rural 
development.

<F P=106> [Mats Knutson report: "Scotched Myths Are Good Arguments"] </F>
  [Text] Sweden's successes in the negotiations in Brussels 
pave the way for a yes in the referendum on Swedish EU [European 
Union] membership. 
  That was the assessment made by Prime Minister Carl Bildt 
when commenting on the agreement between Sweden and the EU at a 
news conference yesterday afternoon. 
  "Many of the myths that the no side has lived on can now be 
consigned to the trash can. The whole of the negotiating 
process shows that the EU takes account of our views," said 
Bildt, who claimed that in the negotiations the EU has accepted 
the majority of Sweden's demands. 
  The prime minister stressed that this will be an important 
argument when it comes to persuading hesitant voters prior to 
the referendum. 
  "I believe that there will be a yes in the referendum 
because 
the negotiations show that in European cooperation account is 
taken of national demands. 
  ``We know one thing for certain and that is that outside the 
EU we will have no influence at all. 
  ``We would become a peripheral state,'' Carl Bildt said. 
  Not surprisingly, the prime minister was very pleased with 
the day's agreement in Brussels. 
  "It is a very, very satisfactory result from the 
negotiations. This is the most important international agreement 
for Sweden this century," Bildt said. 
  He praised the Swedish negotiators in Brussels who were led 
by European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel and called them 
diplomacy's answer to Sweden's national ice hockey team. 
  Carl Bildt was unwilling, however, to discuss when a Swedish 
referendum should be held. This will now be decided in 
consultations among the parties represented in the Riksdag, he 
said. 
  "But we should not drag our feet unnecessarily." 
  Carl Bildt said that he was not unhappy that in a phasing-in 
period the reduction in Sweden's membership contribution to the 
EU will be less than what Sweden's negotiators had initially 
been demanding. 
  "This is something that can of course always be discussed, 
but we did after all get half of what we demanded." 
  Today at 0900 Carl Bildt will brief the Riksdag on the 
agreement in Brussels and answer the questions of Riksdag 
deputies.

  [Excerpt] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl played a decisive 
role in helping Sweden to reach an agreement with the European 
Union [EU] yesterday, and Prime Minister Carl Bildt thanked Kohl 
for his contributions in a telephone conversation today. 
  [Begin recording] [Bildt] The German contribution was very 
important in the final stages of these negotiations, and we have 
also had reason to thank other people: The Belgian foreign 
minister made important contributions, and we had the 
opportunity to be in contact with the British foreign secretary 
at a decisive stage; so these complement the contributions that 
were naturally made by the Greek chairmanship. I think the 
German political will was of decisive importance. 
  [Unidentified reporter] So without that contribution there 
might not have been any agreement? 
  [Bildt] We cannot know that, but I think that it played a 
decisive role, in that the negotiations were able to continue at 
a critical stage and lead to a conclusion, and it is also 
playing a big role in that negotiations are now continuing with 
Norway and will, I believe, lead to a result. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Mats Knutson report: "Carlsson Hoping for Yes From Party </F>
Congress"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that in principle the negotiations 
on Swedish EU [European Union] membership are now complete, a 
referendum should not be held until late in the year. So said 
Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson at a news 
conference yesterday afternoon. 
  "It is the most important question of the 20th century that 
is now to be the subject of a referendum. It is very important 
to allow the democratic process to take the time it needs," 
Ingvar Carlsson said. 
  He expects that in the early summer the Social Democrats 
will 
be able to hold an extraordinary party congress on EU membership 
and hopes to get a yes to Swedish EU membership at that congress. 
  "I would view it as a setback if the congress said no," 
Ingvar Carlsson said at yesterday's news conference. 
  In addition to the the party leader, Mats Hellstrom, the 
Social Democrats' spokesman on European questions, took part in 
the news conference. Both were very positive toward the outcome 
of the Swedish negotiations in Brussels earlier in the day. 
  "It is a historic agreement," said Social Democratic leader 
Ingvar Carlsson, who was satisfied on all points with the 
exception of the Swedish membership contribution to the EU 
during an initial phasing-in period. 
  "On that point we had been hoping to make greater progress, 
but we think nevertheless that a more or less acceptable result 
has been achieved. In all negotiations it is a question of give 
and take," Ingvar Carlsson said. 
  "I do not think that a result from the negotiations under a 
Social Democratic government would have been very much different 
from the result we have now achieved," he added, assessing that 
the prospects after the successes in the negotiations in 
Brussels of a Swedish yes to the EU in a future referendum are 
increasing. 
  Both Ingvar Carlsson and Mats Hellstrom praised European 
Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel for his input into the 
membership negotiations. Carlsson and Hellstrom also said that 
they are satisfied that the government took account of the 
demands that the Social Democrats voiced during the negotiations. 
  "The government accepted that the Social Democratic 
opposition's demands should have an effect on the Swedish

  "It is good that Sweden has been able to unite behind 
important national interests."

<F P=106> [Interview with Boris Zenkov, Russian ambassador to Cyprus, </F>
by Rena Koulermou-Larkou at the Russian Embassy in Nicosia on 25 
February] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Koulermou-Larkou] Mr. 
Zenkov, my first question concerns Russia's new initiative for 
more active involvement in the Cyprus issue, a topic to which 
the foreign minister referred when he was asked about Robert 
Lamb's [U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus] 
visit to Moscow. 
  [Zenkov] There is no Russian initiative, but moves within 
the framework of cooperation among UN Security Council members. 
For two years now, the country-members of the Security Council 
have decided to coordinate their moves for common action and 
greater involvement of the Security Council in the efforts to 
solve the Cyprus issue. These deliberations take place in order 
to exchange views and evaluations so that the Security Council 
can have a more correct picture of what happens. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Does this mean that we should not expect 
a dynamic intervention by Russia as in the case of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? Lamb's visit to Moscow gave the impression 
that something new is being done, that there is more movement. 
  [Zenkov] Lamb's visit is part of routine deliberations. See 
it through this lens: We both see this glass on the table, it 
is the same glass. But due to your position, you see it from a 
different angle than I see it. Therefore, we as a member of the 
Security Council we have our own contacts with the two sides in 
Cyprus, not necessarily with the same people that the Americans, 
French and British meet. That is why it is necessary to brief 
each other. Nelson Ledsky [former U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus] went to Moscow too, just as we went to 
Washington for the same purpose. The Security Council aims at 
creating movement so that the UN secretary general's efforts 
bring results. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Are you optimistic that the efforts will 
bring results? 
  [Zenkov] In diplomacy, there is no room for someone who does 
not believe in justice and good. There are always hopes, 
otherwise why try? 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] The fact that you try became evident a 
few days ago during a television interview. I would like you to 
tell me how you respond to criticism against you for the 
metaphor you used. You said, the Cyprus issue is like a patient 
suffering from gangrene and that the advised therapy is to cut 
off the infected leg. [United Democratic Union of Cyprus 
Chairman Vasos] Lissaridhis said that if this is the treatment 
you propose, then you are not a good doctor. [Lissaridhis is a 
doctor by profession] 
  [Zenkov] Mr. Lissaridhis is a friend and I respect him. We 
always speak honestly and amiably in our meetings. But I should 
tell you that I do not aspire to get a doctor's diploma in 
Cyprus. The evaluation I made was not one of a doctor, but one 
of a diplomat. As I said at the beginning, I speak as a person 
who has lived in Cyprus for many years, loves this place and 
hopes that peace and stability will come. I did not analyze or 
write a doctoral thesis during that interview. I simply said 
what I feel and continue to believe that today we are living the 
last effort to keep what is called the Cyprus issue alive. 
Twenty years have passed without progress. The generations who 
remember cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots 
are disappearing. The friendly feelings that existed at some 
point are being forgotten. Unfortunately, and this is a 20th 
century phenomenon, an explosion of chauvinism is coming to the 
surface. Pseudo-feelings and hates are created and the new 
generations perhaps will not have the desire to live in a 
unified Cyprus. This was the reason for my interview, and if 
some politicians or people did not like it, that does not mean I 
was unfair. As I say, I am not a ten-pound note that should be 
desirable to all. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Do you think that there is a 
possibility of results in this last effort on the Cyprus issue, 
of which you are a part? 
  [Zenkov] There is a possibility, but very little. What is 
left is the last one. Two or three more years and there will be 
no possibilities. At least, that is the way I see it. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] You said before that there is always 
hope. However, we are only at the beginning of this effort for 
the confidence-building measures and there are already such 
problems, which give the impression that we are close to an 
impasse. 
  [Zenkov] No, we can not accept that there is no way out. If 
we find difficulties on the left, we will turn to the right. 
Again, if we find difficulties in our way, we will turn 
elsewhere. Of course there are problems. If they did not 
exist, there would not have been a need for us to be here and 
try to solve them. However, it is very early to expect 
something right now. Do not forget that the process of the 
confidence-building measures has just begun. 
  [Koulermou-Larkou] Is it perhaps the waiting that causes 
anxiety? 
  [Zenkov] We are also anxious. The Russians especially are 
very sensitive to someone else's pain. And me, personally. 
However, this anxiety reminds me of a Russian anecdote. In 
Russia's northern regions, where there is winter for 11 months 
and spring for one month, a farmer plants potatoes as soon as 
spring comes. The next day, he digs out the potatoes he planted 
and begins eating them. A friend asks him: What are you doing? 
The farmer says: I can not wait for them to grow. I am hungry 
now.... 
  So in Cyprus too, some people are anxious to reach 
conclusions or expect results before anything begins.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Officials"] </F>
  [Text] Two U.S. officials, Robert Lamb, the U.S. State 
Department special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, and U.S. 
Undersecretary of State Steven (Oxman), are being sent to 
Nicosia to help "rescue" the proximity talks. It is not known 
how the two U.S. officials will try to help or whether they will 
make any new proposals or plans to facilitate the talks that 
have essentially come to a halt. If Lamb and (Oxman) are coming 
to Nicosia merely to persuade us to agree to implement the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's], we believe their mission 
will be useless. The Greek Cypriot side will not accept 
pressure or suggestions about the CBM's. It has repeatedly 
raised its arguments, which foreigners have described as 
reasonable and realistic! So our side has permanently closed 
the door to further concessions on Famagusta's fenced-off area 
and Nicosia Airport. 
  Every side believes next week should be decisive for future 
developments, particularly the future of the proximity talks. 
This is because, as Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
alternate special representative in Cyprus, revealed, the UN 
envoys will make some new suggestions. So we will wait to see 
the new suggestions that are being prepared by the UN envoys in 
Nicosia. UN circles implied that the new ideas "will break the 
deadlock." 
  Developments in the Cyprus issue are expected in the third 
and last phase of the proximity talks, which is believed to be 
the last, the decisive one, for future developments. If the new 
round of talks achieves no positive result because of the 
Turkish side's insistence on its known positions, essentially, 
to hold hostage those Greeks who return to Famagusta and acquire 
"state" rights for Nicosia Airport, then the New York talks will 
be useless. The chapter of the talks will close and we will 
start preparing to get out of the deadlock created by the Turks, 
which is tolerated by insincere foreigners.

Kakavyia. Furthermore, tension has risen in Albania following 
the arrest of businessmen from North Ipiros and four Albanian 
customs officers. Our correspondent in Ioannina, Yeoryios

  [Kirousis] The situation in Kakavyia has become unbearable 
today here as hundreds of trucks have piled up on both sides of 
the Greek-Albania border. The Greek customs checkpoint 
continues to allow passage to only five fuel-carrying trucks per 
day, but problems are now being caused by Albanian customs, 
which processes customs documents at an extremely slow pace. In 
addition, many Greek tanker trucks have been confiscated and are 
being held at the Albanian customs checkpoint. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Column by Kira Adham: "The Meaning of EU Commission's `No' </F>
Decision"] 
  [Text] During a meeting behind closed doors yesterday, the 
European Union [EU] Commission did not come to any specific 
decision against Greece for its measures against Skopje [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. On the contrary, 
it decided to continue mediation efforts of EU Commissioner Hans 
Van Den Broek. 
  That means the EU Commission yesterday decided to act 
strictly within a political framework against Greece, and allow 
time to search for a formula that will allow the dialogue 
between Athens and Skopje to resume. The EU Commission put 
aside, for the time being, the "penalties" and Greece's recourse 
to the European Court, thus greatly displeasing all those EU 
partners who are annoyingly in a hurry, pushy and openly 
pro-Skopje and who were certain that it would issue a 
condemnation against Greece. 
  With yesterday's move, the European Union clearly indicated 
two specific things: 

  -  It had great difficulty in reaching a 
heavily condemnatory decision against a member state that also 
holds the presidency of the Union. Such a development would 
have been a severe blow to the European Union itself, something 
which EU Commission President Jacques Delors, as champion of the 
"European family," wants to avoid at all costs. 
  -  It was very 
unwilling to see the issue of Skopje move outside the EU's 
influence, something which could happen if the Commission's 
mediation effort and the issue of Skopje were to pass 
exclusively into Washington's hands and those of UN's American 
mediator Cyrus Vance. 
  Yesterday's development gives Athens a brief respite and 
[adds] a note of optimism for the future of the issue of Skopje, 
following the overall international negative reaction to 
Greece's measures. 
  Moreover, in reviewing the overall negative and/or offensive 
reaction, because actually there is some of that too, Athens has 
the assurance that its measures are now a part of the new 
reality and, as such, are receiving relevant consideration by 
all.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos described

to take Greece to the European Court for its measures against 
Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] as 
positive. In a statement made today, Venizelos said the EU 
Commission's decision puts the weight on the political aspect of 
the issue, something which the Greek Government has stressed 
continuously. 
  Responding to a question about the revelation in a 
television 
program regarding heroin processing plants in Skopje, Venizelos 
said that the Greek Government will examine the evidence that 
was reported and bring it to the attention of the other Balkan 
countries. He said that it is necessary to clarify the 
situation, and the responsible ministers have already been 
informed and are working on the issue.

  [Text] The Greek economy is in a mess: unemployment is on 
the rise, development is not as it should be, servicing the 
burgeoning public debt is draining away GNP and inflation is 
high. All this was noted by Alternate Minister of National 
Economy, Ioannis Papandoniou, speaking yesterday at the opening 
of the Panhellenic Industrial Conference called 
"Competitiveness, Development, Employment." 
  The session, which continues today and was organised by SEV 
(the Federation of Greek Industries) and regional federations, 
was well represented by delegates from all sectors of the state, 
business, and labour. 
  One of the major measures the government has decided on is 
the flotation of minority holdings in the big public 
corporations, which will be floated on the Athens Sofokleous 
Street stock exchange. This will provide a boon for state 
finances, while ensuring reformation of the corporations 
themselves. 
  Papandoniou stressed that things need not necessarily be in 
such a mess, and attributed the state of affairs to past errors 
in financial policy, the high cost of capital, widespread tax 
evasion, and high inflation. 
  Unemployment is high, especially in certain areas of the 
country, while overall figures for Greece are around 10 percent. 
The government, said Papandoniou, intends to crack down on the 
ballooning public debt, the servicing of which swallows 16 
percent of GNP. Another major problem is inflation, which the 
government intends to bring down to the European Union (EU) 
average by 1996. 
  This is an extremely optimistic target, as Greek inflation 
was running at 11.2 percent for consumer goods and services in 
January, while the corresponding EU average is 3.4 percent. 
  The deputy minister explained that recovery could be 
approached through strict adherence to the 1994 budget, and 
reform of the tax system. 
  Mr Papandoniou delivered the opening speech in place of 
ailing [Finance] Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas. Bank of Greece 
Governor Ioannis Boutos will deliver the closing address this 
evening.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 3 (A.A.) -- State minister and 
government spokesman Yildirim Aktuna said today that the 
decision of Parliament to remove the political immunity of seven 
members of the Democracy Party (DEP) has eased the public 
conscience. 
  In a written statement, Aktuna said the important thing at 
this moment is to prevent certain DEP deputies from using their 
immunity as a shield and to pave way for independent justice. 
  Parliament removed the immunity of six DEP members Wednesday 
[3 March] and is set to remove the immunity of another three 
today. 
  "The members of Parliament will certainly act in line with 
the people's will," he said. "Certain DEP members had recently 
intensified their actions against the unity of the country." 
  He added that a recent statement of Hatip Dicle, who 
described the killing of five military cadets and the injuring 
of 26 by a separatist terrorist organization as "a normal action 
in war" had created deep resentment in society. 
  Aktuna added that the March 27 local polls will be conducted 
in a safe atmosphere. 
  The DEP, which held 13 seats in the 450-seat Parliament 
announced a week ago that it was withdrawing from the polls.

<F P=106> [Report by Adnan Akfirat] </F>
  [Excerpts] There are still repercussions from the warning 
issued by the Chief of the General Staff Dogan Gures to the 
government during the 21 February meeting of the National 
Security Council, which met at the request of the Chief of 
General Staff Dogan Gures. While the papers and television 
jointly sang the refrain that "there is no coup," this was in 
fact confirmed by statements made by General Hursit Tolon, 
secretary general of General Staff, and Colonel Dogu 
Silahcioglu, head of the Public Relations Department of the 
General Staff, to the effect that "DEP [Democracy Party] leader 
Hatip Dicle's statement has generated indignation within the 
Armed Forces," and by President Demirel's statement that "the 
Army is uneasy." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Landing at the Cankaya Presidential Palace </H5>
  These are the developments which led up to the General 
Staff's warning to the Government: Five noncommissioned cadets 
were killed by a bomb explosion at Istanbul's Tuzla train 
station on 12 February. The PKK's [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
revenge teams claimed responsibility for the attack. The 
developments took a new turn when, replying to Guneri Civaoglu's 
questions on ATV [television station] on 17 February, DEP leader 
Hatip Dicle said: "I do not approve of the Tuzla incident, but, 
everybody in military uniform is a target during a war. 
However, the Geneva treaty prohibits the targeting of 
civilians." These words triggered the process that ended with 
the warning by the General Staff. 
  Gures went to Cankaya Presidential Palace on 18 February 
without a prior appointment. The chief of the General Staff 
said the generals serving in the southeast were enraged, and 
criticized Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk and Parliament 
for producing nothing but words. 
  This was followed by a mini-security summit with the 
participation of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Gunes' warning 
that "there is serious concern" was also repeated in a veiled 
manner at the summit. After the meeting, SABAH's Ankara 
reporter quoted political circles as saying "a decision was made 
about a number of DEP deputies." At the demand of Gures, this 
meeting decided to immediately lift the immunity of Hatip Dicle 
and a number of DEP deputies. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed column: "What Does DEP Want?"] </F>
  [Text] The Democracy Party [DEP] is an ethnic political 
establishment. In other words, its priority objective is to 
safeguard and improve the Kurdish people's rights in Turkey. In 
view of that, the problems it may create in the country must be 
regarded as normal. 
  Meanwhile, separating the problem in southeastern Turkey 
from 
the question of terrorism and the confusion created by the armed 
clashes in that region as well as placing it on the 
parliamentary agenda will be in Turkey's interest. 
  The Kurdish problem is currently one of the most sensitive 
issues in Turkey. The Turkish people are not yet accustomed to a 
political party that assumes responsibility for an ethnic 
problem and that appears on the political scene to defend it. 
Obviously, such an establishment will create antagonism in 
certain circles. 
  This being the case, how can DEP leader Hatip Dicle's 
behavior be explained? How can the leader of a political party 
forget he is a member of the Turkish Parliament? Mr. Dicle is a 
member of the National Assembly and enjoys political immunity. 
Nevertheless, as a public figure, he is bound by the laws. 
Meanwhile, he has to see to it that his party is successful. 
  Can any politician forget or ignore all that and maintain 
his 
political activities? 
  Yesterday it was reported that Mr. Dicle has created a wave 
of uneasiness even within his own party structure. It will be 
recalled that he reacted to the incident in Tuzla by saying "a 
war is being fought." Furthermore, he congratulated 300,000 
eligible recruits for avoiding conscription. All that created 
the impression that he represents the Workers Party of Kurdistan 
and not the people. 
  Several DEP deputies, who have opposed Dicle's behavior, 
fear 
their party may lose its prestige and forfeit the support of its 
grass roots. 
  Dicle's remarks apparently have exhausted the patience of 
Internal Affairs Minister Nahit Mentese and General Dogan Gures, 
chief of the General Staff. They reacted strongly against 
Dicle's behavior. It is necessary to recall Dicle's remarks 
after the bomb attack in Tuzla in order to better understand the 
meaning of the reaction by Mentese and Gures. Referring to the 
cadets who were killed in that attack, Dicle said: "They were 
in military uniform. Consequently, they were a military target. 
Innocent people are also killed in a war. According to the 
Geneva Conventions, military targets are fired on." 
  Was Dicle aware of the reaction his remarks would create in 
various circles? Whether or not he was makes no difference. DEP 
must learn the rules of politics if it wishes to have a place in 
the parliamentary system in Turkey. However, if it wishes to be 
the representative in the National Assembly of an armed 
organization, then that is a different matter. 
  The people are waiting for that party to clarify its 
position 
on the matter.

  [Text] The commander of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
lacks men to consolidate the Bosnian cease-fire. General Cot 
has criticized the attitude of NATO which, he says, is only 
ready to send troops once an overall peace agreement has been 
reached. Here he is: He is demanding urgent reinforcements. 
  [Begin Cot recording] What I need is troops, immediately. If 
I count on my fingers who can send me soldiers tomorrow morning, 
it is very simple: The Americans first of all; the British 
second; the French third. Planning in the NATO framework [is 
based on] 100,000 men, and then it was brought down to 50,000 
men: Today I am asking for 10,000. If they don't want 
everything that has been achieved with immense effort in 
Sarajevo to collapse completely, these troops must get here 
straight away. 
  We had to bend over backwards to get 15,000 men to Sarajevo, 
who came from Bosnia itself, from Croatia, and even from 
outside, since France sent a (?fighter squadron). We cannot go 
any further now. I am saying that I am less optimistic than Mr. 
Akashi. I am saying that if we do not get troops quickly, I am 
afraid that what we have gained will be lost. [end recording]

  [Text] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Visiting Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic called on Bosnia-Herzegovina's Serbs 
Thursday [3 March] to join the negotiations between the 
ex-Yugoslav republic's Moslems and Croats on forming a 
federation. 
  "We share France's view that an agreement must be reached 
with the Serbs," Granic said after a meeting with French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe. 
  Croats will suggest "the Serbs join this federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the same conditions which have been 
accepted by the other two parties (Croats and Moslems), and the 
negotiations which are going to start" in the wake of the 
federation agreement signed Tuesday in Washington. 
  However Croatia would seek "the support of France and the 
European Union to get back" land captured by Serbs in Croatia, 
he said. 
  "Of course we want to normalize relations with Belgrade, but 
this can only be done with reintegration, through peaceful 
means, of (Serb-) occupied territories in Croatia, as is 
provided for in the plan signed in Washington." 
  Granic also said he "agreed the humanitarian situation 
should 
improve as quickly as possible" in Bosnia. Humanitarian convoys 
must be allowed to travel unhindered through central Bosnia and 
"all prisoners" of war should be freed. 
  Juppe for his part said France believed "there could be no 
stable settlement unless the Serb community were associated" 
with the federation agreement. 
  He stressed the "situation on the ground must improve" and 
noted the "air network" set up by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the United Nations to discourage renewed 
hostilities remained "in effect." 
  Juppe said a "global settlement" of the almost two-year-old 
Bosnian conflict meant "active participation by the Americans, 
Russians, and Europeans" and that the European Union "will 
participate in the region's reconstruction" once peace has 
returned.

Gebhardt von Moltke said here Thursday [3 March] the Western 
European Union (WEU), the only exclusively European defence 
organisation, could eventually be brought under the control of 
the European Union. 
  Moltke told a seminar of French senators that the WEU's 
executive council could disappear, as the Maastricht Treaty in 
effect conferred the power of political decision-making in 
defence matters on the foreign ministers of the 12 member states. 
  The WEU, considered the European pillar of the North 
Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation, consists of 10 members. The only two EU 
states that are not part of the WEU are Ireland and Denmark.

<F P=106> [Baudouin Bollaert report on interview with European </F>
Commissioner for Agriculture Rene Steichen in Brussels; date not 
given: "Rene Steichen's Four Truths"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Luxembourg's Rene Steichen, 51 years old 
and commissioner for "green Europe" for 14 months, has just 
taken part in what he called "the longest marathon of my life": 
in other words the five days of fierce negotiations on the 
expansion of the European Union with Sweden, Finland, Austria, 
and Norway. It must be said that agriculture was probably one 
of the biggest obstacles to be overcome, because the new 
arrivals have prices which are markedly higher than those of the 
Twelve and will have to be brought into line as of 1 January 
1995. 
  In an interview with LE FIG-ECO, Mr. Steichen first explains 
that he is "satisfied" with the results and that the various 
amounts of compensation granted to the candidates "will not 
affect the implementation of the reform of the CAP [Common 
Agricultural Policy]." In his view, these countries have "a 
concept of public support for agriculture which is closer to 
regional development and environmental protection than to 
performance at all costs" and, he added, "because the reform 
tries to reconcile the two problems, I am not particularly 
worried." 
  However, he makes no secret of the fact that it is "rather 
the rules for operating the European machinery which will become 
problematical." The need to depart from the (famous) guidelines 
of the European budget, which place a ceiling on agricultural 
spending during the 1994-1999 period, could thus prove 
necessary. "It is an important question," Rene Steichen 
admitted. "A solution will have to be found. What solution? 
We are working on it. When the GDR automatically became a 
member, the guideline was increased.... The arrival of the new 
members should generate more GDP and hence a broader guideline." 
  Is he not afraid, more generally, that "green Europe" -- 
which absorbs a good half of the European budget -- will be at 
the mercy of a budgetary crisis? "Every effort has been made to 
prevent it," he replied. "However, there are problems to be 
solved: The monetary chaos has led to an additional bill of 10 
billion [currency not specified] which the Twelve have pledged 
to settle. We will have to be careful about spending in 1995 
because economic growth will only leave us little room to 
manuever.... But I do not expect anything insurmountable." 
  At a time when he is preparing to fly to Budapest, the 
commissioner could not fail to discuss the competition from the 
East European countries which is likely to become increasingly 
fierce. "For the time being, that is not the case," he said. 
"More because of their own structural problems than because of 
our health or other barriers, their agricultural exports to us 
fell by 7 percent between 1991 and 1992, whereas our exports to 
them increased by 11 percent. I would like to add that 
agricultural production fell by 12 percent in Poland and by 20 
percent in Hungary in 1992." 
  But Mr. Steichen admits that it is "inevitable" that the 
Twelve will open up to East Europe and that for 30 years the 
East European countries have often been a "convenient outlet for 
our surpluses." He thinks that "the fall in prices for which 
the reform makes provision will be the best protection of the 
European Union's agricultural potential faced with competitoin 
from these Central and East European countries which are already 
opening up and will open up more." 
<H5>  Verbal Exaggerations </H5>
  The commissioner for "green Europe," who is confident by 
nature and hardworking, is satisfied with the implementation of 
the CAP reform more than one year on. "Even though the 
individual position of many farmers is still worrying, I think 
we must first put an end to the `alarmist' statements on the 
CAP," he said. "There is deep disquiet in this section of the 
rural world. The drop in the number of young farmers setting up 
worries me. Should it be attributed to the uncertainties of 
GATT or the reform? Some extreme statements also influence the 
farmers' individual behavior.... 
  ``What is the real situation? We were at a point at which 
European agriculture was threatened with explosion both on the 
internal and international levels. The situation has not become 
ideal but we now have a plan to support agriculture which is 
trying to reconcile competitiveness and the occupation of the 
rural area. The rules of reciprocal discipline accepted in the 
GATT framework henceforth bring us international peace.'' 
  With regard to big farms, Rene Steichen thinks that the 
objectives are being achieved. "The control of grain production 
at around 165 million tons will not lead to additional set-aside 
if it is confirmed," he noted. "The ruinous stocks are being 
reduced. They were still 32 million tons last summer. They are 
21 million tons now. Finally, the regular loss of our markets 
in animal feed in favor of substitutes is being reversed." 
<H5>  Positive Result of the Reform </H5>
  "Our fears," he continued, "relate to beef and we have been 
saying this from the start. There is an ultimate risk of a 
serious crisis if production is not better controlled, which 
would have serious consequences for stock-raisers' incomes. 
Moreover, the sale of the surpluses is continuing: 400,000 
tons of stocks currently, as against 1 million tons last year." 
  Mr. Steichen also thinks that the setting up of the system 
of 
direct aid to farmers is going well. Especially in France where 
"aid has been paid within the time stipulated," which proves 
"the efficiency of the French civil service." But he refuses to 
launch into controversy over the development of incomes. "I 
will merely say to those who predicted a disaster that they were 
mistaken: There was a 12 percent increase in France in revenue 
from `big farms' in 1993 compared with 1992." 
  "I note," he added, "that the sectors which are recording 
considerable loss of revenue are those which have not been 
reformed...." And he announced that, in the wine, fruit, and 
vegetables sectors which have still narrowly escaped reform, he 
intends to make proposals soon. The wine issue "greatly 
worries" him. Moreover, he thinks that the fruit and vegetable 
situation is "complex." 
<H5>  A Set of New Measures </H5>
  What if the CAP reform failed? This iconoclastic question 
received a direct answer. "The risks of failure cannot be ruled 
out. Some people are even predicting them with relish. If the 
race for yields is not controlled, if there is cheating over 
subsidies or set-aside, if there is monetary instability, there 
will be a problem. And it will not be the fault of GATT or the 
Americans... It will then be necessary to choose between two bad 
solutions: Either a return to market stabilization measures 
which will increase the rural exodus -- that was the policy 
followed before the reform -- or taking administrative measures 
to manage production which will curb intra-Community trade. 
Indeed, it is in France's interests to ensure that the reform 
succeeds even if some provisions may be reviewed." 
  Mr. Steichen thinks this reform provides "a panoply of new 
measures" which can also contribute to the regional development 
policy. "Our aid can henceforth encourage environmental 
protection, the use of pasture, forests, rural tourism, and so 
forth. We are also preparing a system for the protection of 
regional products inspired by French legislation. Finally, the 
considerable increase in Europe's participation in contracts 
between states and regions must be noted. More than half of 
France's rural areas will benefit from a contribution of 15 
billion francs for the next five years."

  [Text] Brussels, March 3 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
warned the countries of Central and East Europe on Thursday [3 
March] to put a lid on subsidised agricultural prices and 
production. 
  At a conference in Budapest, EU Agriculture Commissioner 
Rene 
Steichen warned that excessive price subsidies led to expensive 
over-production, as it had in West Europe. A text of his speech 
was made available here. 
  Steichen said the Union was ready to support agricultural 
reform in East Europe, but also intended to protect EU farmers 
against floods of cheap agricultural imports from the region.

  [Text] Brussels, March 3 (AFP) -- A controversial 1991 
European Union regulation that television channels must 
broadcast a majority of European programmes is being largely 
respected, the European Commission said here Thursday [3 March]. 
  It released a survey showing that 70 of 105 channels -- 66 
percent -- had obeyed the directive, which states that more than 
50 percent of programmes excluding sport and news must be 
provided by European producers. 
  Among those not meeting the directive, a Commission 
spokesman 
named several satellite channels in Britain and a cable channel 
in France. 
  The Commission is preparing a report on the directive and 
possible modifications before October this year.

<F P=106> [Roy Walsh report: "Cannon Aimed at Delors or Just Another </F>
Popgun?"] 
  [Text] For the past three months Jacques Blanc, an 
ambitious French centrist politician, has been energetically 
criss-crossing the European Union [EU] in his campaign to be the 
first president of the Committee of the Regions, only the third 
new EU body to be created in 40 years. 
  This week he was making a final pitch for support in 
Belgium, 
the Netherlands, and Greece. On 9 March, when the Committee of 
the Regions (COR) holds its first meeting in Brussels and the 
189 members vote for their president, Blanc, a French MP, the 
president of Languedoc-Roussillon and mayor of the tiny commune 
of La Canourgue, will learn whether his personal odyssey has 
been successful. 
  But even before it emerges belatedly from the womb, the new 
committee Blanc seeks to lead seems a weakling child. The COR 
was designed to give the regions a voice in EU policy-making 
under the Maastricht Treaty. But it has been so watered down 
since first conceived that critics rate it the equivalent of a 
popgun when it comes to firing off shots at Commission President 
Jacques Delors and his merry men, not to mention EU governments. 
  It has so many potential faults that some fear it could 
retreat into paralysis. The 189 members have been appointed in 
national delegations, ranging from 24 for large EU countries to 
six for Luxembourg. 
  Alongside any chauvinistic differences lies the ideological 
divide. The COR is likely to be dominated by the centre Right, 
although the socialists will be the largest political grouping. 
  But the biggest divide is likely to be the almost equal 
split 
between representatives of local authorities and those of 
regions, with their widely different powers and roles. For 
instance, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia with its 
18 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product larger than 
seven EU countries, may be less than content to sit down and 
argue the point with local mayors and councillors. 
  Blanc faces tough competition for the post of president. 
Charles Gray, a cheerful Scottish Socialist who was previously 
head of the EU's largest local authority, Strathclyde, has 
written personally to all members announcing his candidacy. 
  Luc Van den Brande, the minister-president of Flanders, 
which 
under Belgium's new Federal Constitution enjoys considerable 
legislative powers, including the right to conclude 
international treaties, is another challenger. Finally, the 
contest became a four-way fight when Pasquall Maragall, the 
widely respected Socialist mayor of Barcelona for the past 12 
years, entered the fray. 
  There is even speculation that Jordi Pujol, the Catalan 
leader whose support for Felipe Gonzalez is keeping the minority 
Socialist Spanish Government in power, may throw his hat in the 
ring at the last minute, claiming that he alone has the 
political stature to make the early days of the COR a success. 
Amid these manoeuvres, Germany, the most federal EU member, is 
ignoring this battlefield and targeting instead the post of 
secretary-general, which is permanent and likely to be the seat 
of power. Presidents change every two years. 
  To many it is a mystery why such experienced politicians 
used 
to wielding power at home should wish to become the figurehead 
of a body which enjoys neither legislative nor budgetary powers. 
Indeed, the COR is a far cry from the powerful body which 
Germany initially sought. 
  Despite support from Belgium, Italy, Spain and the European 
Commission, Germany's original concept of establishing an organ 
to represent regional interests at the European Union level for 
the first time was considerably weakened during the Maastricht 
negotiations. To save money and curb its influence, the COR has 
been grafted on to the existing EU advisory body, the Economic 
and Social Committee (ESC). 
  That shotgun marriage is resented by both partners. It will 
lead to quarrels over staff and money and has sparked fears in 
the largely invisible ESC, a forum for industry, business, trade 
union and consumer views, that it will be eclipsed by the more 
political COR. Both are working for an early divorce, possibly 
in 1996 when the Maastricht Treaty is reviewed. 
  The COR has had a far from auspicious start to life. Last 
year EU government leaders decreed that it should meet by 15 
January. That date was missed because of local elections in 
Portugal and various administrative difficulties and at least 
four others were pencilled in before agreement was reached to 
meet on 9 and 10 March. Despite the doubts, the Germans, 
Belgians and Spanish are treating the COR seriously. Their 
delegations are almost entirely composed of senior regional 
ministers. 
  The COR has a purely advisory role. Under Maastricht, 
governments must consult it on any legislative initiative in 
five areas. But already the European Commission has decided to 
canvass its views in other areas of obvious interest to local 
and regional authorities, such as voting rights in local 
elections and immigration and asylum policy. 
  Whether governments will listen to these views is another 
matter. But all the presidential candidates agree that only by 
putting their full political weight behind carefully crafted 
opinions will the COR's members be taken seriously. Many, 
particularly the Germans, Spanish and Belgians, will use their 
own national channels to ensure these views are listened to by 
governments. 
  In many ways, the creation of the COR and EU treaty 
recognition of local and regional government is inevitable. 
Regionalism is a powerful force in many EU countries. About 
half the legislation adopted by the EU is ultimately implemented 
by regions and local authorities. If regions are involved in 
the decision making, it should, say the COR's supporters, be 
easier to ensure those laws are effectively applied. 
  After the traumas of the Maastricht debate exposed the 
credibility gap between Europe's governments and EU institutions 
on the one hand and citizens on the other, many now see regions 
and local authorities as a means to bridge the divide. The 
Committee of the Regions is on probation. It has just two years 
before its role is reviewed in which to demonstrate to its 
critics and supporters why it should be taken seriously. 
<H5>  Structure of the Committee </H5>
  The Committee of the Regions first meets in Brussels on 9-10 
March. It has 189 members, plus an equal number of alternates, 
appointed by European Union governments for four years. 
  Germany, France, Italy and Britain have 24 members each. 
Spain has 21, Belgium, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal have 
12, Denmark and Ireland have nine, and Luxembourg has six. 
  Budget for 1994: ECU12 million ($13.5 million). 
  Membership ranges from regional ministers and presidents to 
local councillors and mayors of small villages and communes. 
  The president is to be elected by the members at the first 
meeting. 
  The secretary general is to be appointed by senior Committee 
members. 
  The COR was established under the Maastricht Treaty to give 
EU regions a voice in policy-making. Its role is purely 
advisory. 
  Governments must consult the COR in five specific areas: 
economic and social cohesion, including the ECU13 billion to be 
spent on special EU regional projects over the next six years; 
trans-European networks; public health; culture; and education 
and training. In addition, the European Commission will consult 
the Committee on other subjects conceived to be of regional 
interest.

  [Text] Brussels, March 3 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
will not renew its import quota on aluminium from Russia, 
Ukraine, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan, which expired on February 
28, a spokesman for the European Commission said here Thursday 
[3 March]. 
  He said the quota limit amounting to 180,000 tonnes a year 
imposed last August was no longer necessary following an accord 
by six major producers in Ottawa this week to cut output by 
about two million tonnes a year. 
  The six are Australia, Canada, the European Union, Norway, 
Russia and the United States. Annual world over-production of 
the metal is estimated at between 1.5 million and two million 
tonnes. 
  Under the accord, Russia, which had been largely blamed for 
causing a glut on the market, agreed to cut aluminium output by 
500,000 tonnes a year in 1994 and 1995. 
  The spokesman said the EU quotas, mainly on Russia, had been 
imposed last August as a "temporary, necessary and urgent 
measure" to pressure the Russians into negotiating the 
production cut agreement. 
  He said the EU was "cautiously optimistic" that the 
"memorandum of understanding," accepted in Ottawa but negotiated 
in Brussels in January, was starting to bite. 
  It included a commitment by the signatories to help 
restructure the highly-polluting Russian aluminium industry. 
  A meeting to re-assess the state of the aluminium market is 
scheduled here for April 21.

  [Text] Bonn March 3 (CTK) -- Speaking at the end of a 
four-day visit to Germany by Czech deputies, Chairwoman of 
Bundestag Rita Sussmuth praised the good cooperation between the 
two countries' parliaments. 
  The group of ten Czech deputies, all members of the 
parliamentary Foreign Committee, included Committee Chairman 
Jiri Payne. Their visit took place at the invitation of the 
German parliamentary Foreign Committee. 
  Germany urgently needs good relations with its neighbours, 
Sussmuth said, adding that the German Parliament intends to 
ratify the Czech association agreement with the European Union 
before its summer recess. 
  Ratification of association agreements by large countries is 
a sign for the smaller countries to follow suit, Payne said, 
adding that Sussmuth was also taking steps to help ensure the 
inclusion in the European Parliament of deputies from the 
post-communist countries. 
  The Czechs met their German counterparts, other German 
parliamentary representatives and high officials from the German 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence and Ministry of 
Economics. Towards the end of their visit they went to 
Dusseldorf, where they met representatives of the Land of 
Nordrhein-Westfallen. 
  German politicians repeatedly stressed the need for the 
Czech 
integration into the European structures, Payne and his German 
counterpart Hans Stercken said, adding that both countries have 
a common interest in the Central European political and economic 
stability. 
  Wolfgang Schauble, chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary 
group of deputies, said that the discussion of the Czech-German 
historical relations should continue. The Czech deputies quoted 
him as saying that the Sudeten German question had a German 
dimension. He reportedly also showed interest in Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus's idea of looking for individual rather than 
collective solutions. Schauble also said primarily present and 
future relations should be stressed. 
  Both sides said that German compensation of Czech victims of 
Nazism had not been discussed, but that the Czech deputies had 
made it clear that progress on the matter rested with the 
Germans.

  [Text] Sagindik Nuraliyev, Kazakhstan's trade attache in 
Ankara, has clarified the oil pipeline project that will 
transport Kazakhstan's oil. The Turkish newspapers have 
frequently commented on the matter in the past few days. 
Nuraliyev said: "Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to Europe 
and other markets in the world through a pipeline that will 
traverse Turkey." 
  Recalling that Kazakhstan markets its oil through a pipeline 
to Novosibirsk in Russia, Nuraliyev asserted: "We do not have 
time to wait. We have to sell our oil. Novosibirsk is not an 
alternative." 
  Stressing that the oil pipeline to Novosibirsk, which 
crosses 
through Astrakhan, needs to be modernized, Nuraliyev said the 
decision to repair and renovate that pipeline was made before 
the project for the second pipeline was considered. Nuraliyev 
also denied Turkish press reports that "Russia has been allowed 
to decide on the new project." He said: "The second pipeline, 
which will carry Kazakhstan's oil through Turkey to 
international markets, is a significant project this requires 
significant expertise. Meanwhile, a decision has to be made on 
the route of the pipeline."

  [Text] Algerian Economy Minister Mourad Benachenou has just 
paid a lightning visit to Paris. He met with his French 
counterpart Edmond Alphandery. France is not renewing the aid 
it gave last year for the immediate future, but it has 
reaffirmed its support for the Algerian authorities. Jerome 
Bastion: 
  [Bastion] There is support in principle, but financial 
commitment only behind the IMF [as heard]. This is basically 
Paris's response to the visit by the Algerian economy minister, 
as France has made the continuation of its aid -- 6.3 billion 
francs in 1993 -- conditional on an agreement for the 
rescheduling of the crushing Algerian debt to the IMF. 
  The Algerian economy minister must have been disappointed at 
a time when the Malek government is regularly calling for more 
sympathy and understanding from the French. It should be said 
that Paris's response is somewhat brusque; France, which is 
Algeria's main creditor and is owed more than 18 percent of its 
debt, has already, for example, wiped out Egypt's debt. 
However, France's caution is explained by the reticence of its 
partners in the Paris Club over becoming too involved with an 
unsteady government which is dragging its feet over liberalizing 
its economy. However, on the internal front the Algerian 
authorities have a twofold problem -- finding fresh money to 
avoid bankruptcy and also avoiding the social upheaval which the 
measures to clean up the economy could bring about. 
  Leaving Paris the Algerian minister headed for Washington, 
where he could finalize the stopgap loan announced by the IMF 
head in Algiers a week ago.

<F P=106> [Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux report: "Deputies Feel White </F>
Paper Is Acceptable"] 
  [Text] With neither enthusiasm, nor aversion: The white 
paper on defense published last week will not cause a dispute -- 
at least not in the National Assembly. The deputies on the 
defense and finance committees who started examining it did not 
find anything -- regardless of their political leanings -- that 
would lead to great or violent passions. 
  They read the government's guidelines for ensuring our 
country's security between now to 2015 with "real interest," 
combined with "caution" and scattered "skepticism." They felt 
that the work of the committee chaired by Marceau Long was 
"suitable, honest, and satisfactory," and that the result was 
"acceptable." That is what the respective committee chairmen, 
Jacques and Jacques Boyon, said yesterday to Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard. 
  The pride of France since the early 1980's, the consensus on 
defense still endures. While there are some exceptions, the 
vast majority of the National Assembly does not intend to call 
into question these two pillars of nuclear deterrence and a 
"mixed" Armed Forces model which is based on the principle of 
conscription. The National Assembly also seems resolved to 
maintain a "significant" budgetary effort, i.e., enough to 
guarantee our decisionmaking autonomy. 
  Although the consensus is comprehensive, it nevertheless 
gives the impression of cracking, or even splitting apart, since 
there are now a great many ambiguities and reservations on which 
it rests. The primary quality of the white paper stressed 
Jacques Boyon (of the RPR (Rally for the Republic), Ain) quite 
clearly is that it does not compromise the future. "It does not 
close any doors," the implication being that it will not act as 
a constraint on the future president of the republic, who will 
be elected in 1995. 
<H5>  Debate on M5 </H5>
  The cleverness of the exercise appears with regard to the 
nuclear issue. The white paper satisfies supporters and 
opponents of resuming testing. "The moratorium does not 
currently penalize our discussion, but they will have to be 
resumed," echoed Francois Leotard. Similarly, it does not 
bother enthusiasts of any given weapons system. However, on 
this topic, there are many nuances within the parliamentary 
majority. A good illustration of this is the debate surrounding 
the production of the M5, a missile intended to arm 
missile-launching submarines around 2010 and which, in 1992, was 
the subject of a decision regarding missile launches made by 
Francois Mitterrand. Today, Jacques Chirac feels it is an 
"urgent matter," while Jacques Boyon and Rene Galy-Dejean 
[members of the National Assembly], for example, feel that a 
postponement would not be disastrous. 
  The defense minister does not go along with the idea of 
accelerating this program which, he reiterated, could not have 
been launched until 1995. He also confided that he does not 
intend to give the M5 the same warhead as the M45, or to make an 
S5 version for the Albion platform -- "the cost of that would be 
unreasonable" -- unlike what Francois Mitterrand let it be 
understood. 
  As for the future military planning law, the deputies and 
the 
defense minister agreed to meet again, when the government has 
undertaken the necessary and difficult arbitration between the 
Defense Ministry and the Budget Ministry. Francois Leotard said 
he was satisfied that the basis chosen by the prime minister 
should be the 100.4 billion francs in equipment credits to be 
made available in 1994. From then on, he scarcely hopes to 
obtain more than a rise of 0.5 percent in constant francs. Such 
a result would just be acceptable for the Defense Ministry in 
view of the programs already begun and the new operational 
needs. However, at the same time it would be a notable 
exception to the law on controlling public spending.

  [Excerpt] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Conservative Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur on Thursday [3 March] told trade 
unionists he was determined to go ahead with plans to cut 
France's minimum legal wage, provoking a walk-out by the 
secretary general of the powerful communist-led CGT union, Louis 
Viannet. 
  At a stormy meeting Balladur defended his plan against 
strong 
opposition from trade unions, students and left-wing parties and 
in spite of an opinion poll in the daily Info-Matin that showed 
55 percent of the French opposed the plan while 36 percent 
supported it. 
  Balladur was speaking at a roundtable with trade unionists 
and employers' representatives that had originally been 
scheduled to debate employment prospects, but the meeting was 
dominated by the plan to allow firms to recruit young workers 
and pay them less than the take-home minimum of 880 dollars a 
month. 
  Students and trade unions planned protest marches later on 
Thursday to fight the plan. 
  Viannet said new proposals on the wage cut plan made by 
Balladur on Thursday were "mere window-dressing." He said all 
the trade unions had been unanimous in condemning the plan. 
  Viannet said Balladur had proposed introducing a distinction 
between holders of university degrees and diplomas and 
unqualified youths. 
  Labour Minister Michel Giraud was attending the meeting.

  [Excerpt] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Thousands of students 
demonstrated here on Thursday [3 March] to demand that 
conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur drop plans to cut 
France's minimum legal wage for young people. 
  The university and high school students blocked the 
capital's 
Latin Quarter as police sealed off the nearby residence of the 
prime minister, where he was holding a roundtable meeting on 
employment with trade union leaders and employers' 
representatives. 
  The students shouted "Balladur, you've had it. The kids have 
taken to the streets." 
  Among them was the secretary general of the powerful 
communist-led CGT [General Labor Confederation] union, Louis 
Viannet, who walked out of the meeting with the prime minister 
after he had refused to withdraw his plan. 
  Also among the demonstrators were Communist Party leader 
Robert Hue and Socialist Party official Jean-Christophe 
Cambadelis. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "Rocard, the Left's Handicap"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Socialist Party (PS) is slowly recovering 
from its electoral defeat. The emergence of social movements and 
the impressive mobilization of lay school defenders open new 
prospects for the Left. Nevertheless, if the improvement in the 
partial legislative elections reinvigorates it, this does not 
reverse the balance of power. 
  Ten months after its rout, the PS seems unable to present a 
credible alternative. [passage omitted] The scars of the March 
1993 defeat do not explain everything. In politics, one year is 
an eternity, and the opposition has regenerative qualities. The 
disaffection affecting the Left has a deeper cause: the lack of 
credibility of the PS' first secretary. 
  At a time when [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur is 
paralyzing for the moment the game on the Right because he is 
considered the winner of the race to the presidency under any 
circumstances, Michel Rocard is blocking the game on the Left 
because he has the image of a loser. Polls indicate that he will 
be beaten by a wide margin regardless of the identity of his 
adversary from the majority. The most recent CSA-LE PARISIEN 
poll on the popularity of presidential candidates places him in 
10th place with 27 percent of the vote. Even more worrisome for 
Rocard is the fact that he is far behind [EC Commission 
president] Jacques Delors, who gathers 44 percent of the vote. 
Rocard is even overtaken by [former Minister of Culture] Jack 
Lang (28 percent). 
  Considering his personal qualities, the disaffection 
burdening the PS boss is no doubt unfair. However, it is 
explained by his inability to convince his own camp. Placed 
under high-level surveillance in the PS, Rocard moreover suffers 
from his being the man most detested by [President] Francois 
Mitterrand, who remains the most emblematic figure of the Left. 
Like [Union for French Democracy, UDF leader] Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing, and to a lesser degree [Rally for the Republic, RPR, 
leader] Jacques Chirac, Rocard is laboring under the burden of 
the attrition affecting officials who have been in the limelight 
for more than 20 years. 
  Rocard is the heaviest handicap of the Left, which has no 
lack of talented personalities. Laurent Fabius is the most 
gifted politician of the forty-something generation. Unlike the 
majority, the Left also has a galaxy of (young) women 
politicians capable of incarnating the future: Elisabeth Guigou, 
Segolene Royal, and Martine Aubry. The emergence of the former 
minister of labor is particularly significant. [passage omitted] 
The changing of the guards does exist in the PS. 
  However, the Left is playing with marked cards. Partisan 
logic will probably impose Rocard's candidacy even if the Left 
has a credible candidate in Delors. He gathered 53 percent of 
the vote in the last S0FRES poll, compared with 38 percent for 
Rocard (69 percent among leftist partisans for Delors, 63 
percent for Rocard). The former can attract beyond his camp, the 
latter is contested by his own people. However, just like the 
Right, the Left is intent on justifying the thesis that "the 
best one loses." In this game, the socialists seem to be ahead 
of the majority.

  [Editorial Report] Reaction to Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur's recent television appearance and comments on his 
standing in the polls have appeared in the French press. 
<H5>  Television Appearance </H5>
  Balladur's appearance on the "Heure de Verite" [Hour of 
Truth] television program gave rise to a variety of reactions on 
the Left and the Right, notes "N.G." in the 16 February Paris 
daily LIBERATION. "Most vehement" of all was Robert Hue's, the 
newly appointed leader of the Communist Party (PC), who called 
Balladur's performance "revolting" and "particularly shocking" 
and cynical toward the thousands who suffer from his policies. 
Hue was seconded by Socialist Party (PS) luminary Henri 
EmmanuelIi, who said that "in light of the social regression 
using the fight against unemployment as a pretext, workers must 
mobilize before it is too late." Other socialists chose to 
stress what they perceive to be Balladur's presidential 
ambitions. Laurent Fabius scored the prime minister's "energy 
in not saying he wishes to be a presidential candidate." 
Jean-Paul Huchon, the "lieutenant" of PS leader Michel Rocard, 
accused Balladur of "passivity." "What is not acceptable is to 
give the impression one is resigned to the unacceptable, because 
French society is living a major social breakdown," he said. 
Former Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement affirmed that 
Balladur is only following "what his predecessors condemned." 
  On the Right, National Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen 
claimed that Balladur's talk was "profoundly soporific." He 
likened it to a situation in which Balladur "is not sure you 
will not die, but he promises you that everything will still be 
all right." Within the parliamentary majority, reactions were 
varied. Philippe Vasseur, secretary general of the Republican 
Party, noted that Balladur was "the same as always, pragmatic 
and clear," a reaction "N.G." terms "neither a compliment nor a 
criticism." Similarly, UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin noted 
that while Balladur's "clarifications" were "useful," the "best 
criteria are results." RPR deputy secretary general Jean-Louis 
Debre said in a communique that while the Gaullist movement 
"reiterates its full support for the government's recovery 
policy," the RPR will be a "force for proposals within the 
governmental majority, as the prime minister himself has wished." 
  Balladur's interview was greeted with "skepticism" by trade 
union organizations, "N.G." continues. The French Democratic 
Confederation of Labor (CFDT) denounced the government's "crying 
insufficiencies" in the fight against unemployment, noting that 
"financial orthodoxy and lower labor costs remain the prime 
minister's alpha and omega." According to Marc Blondel, 
secretary general of the Workers' Force (FO), Balladur's policy 
"offers little hope for an effective reduction of unemployment." 
Finally, Louis Viannet, secretary general of the General 
Confederation of Labor (CGT), scored Balladur for trumpeting the 
end of the recession in France. 
<H5>  Balladur V. Chirac </H5>
  "Chirac-ians are regaining hope and delighting in the 
decreased popularity of Edouard Balladur," notes Eric Dupin in 
the 12-13 February LIBERATION. This means that the presidential 
chances of Jacques Chirac are not "as desperate as it seems," he 
continues. The RPR leader's determination to run regardless of 
Balladur's intentions could deprive the prime minister of a 
"major trump card," for Balladur would no longer be considered a 
guarantor against divisions in the Right--such as the "duel" 
between Chirac and UDF leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing--if his 
ambition "created a fatal explosion in the RPR." Even an 
internal primary on the Right between Chirac and Balladur would 
be "risky" for the latter, Dupin contends, for the test would 
be, not to gather a majority of the French, but how to convince 
the conservative camp. Be that as it may, Dupin continues, the 
"moderate and pragmatic" Balladur possesses rather significant 
trump cards to resist Chirac's pressure, the principal being his 
position at the electorate's ideological center of gravity. By 
contrast, Chirac's image is "much more vague," for he cannot 
decide whether he should speak for a hard Right that accuses the 
pirme minister of "excessive prudence," or for a social Right 
that denounces his "economic conformism." It is obvious that 
Chirac is betting more on future Balladur errors than on the 
efficiency of a policy he is still seeking, Dupin concludes. 
<H5>  Balladur's Popularity </H5>
  Despite his recent drop in the polls, Balladur's popularity 
remains high, Jacques Julliard writes in the 10-16 February 
Paris weekly LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR. It is the "quasi-mechanical" 
result of the conjunction of four specific political 
circumstances, he contends. 
  1. The victory of the Right last March, which became even 
more significant because the opposition, still "licking its 
wounds," is incapable of "returning blow for blow." While PS 
leader Michel Rocard is rebuilding his party with "astonishing 
mastery," he has not defined his position toward Balladur, 
"alternating an extremely soft discourse with sometimes 
excessive imprecations." 
  2. The end of an internecine crisis. Balladur has freed the 
Right and the Center of the anxiety of losing the presidential 
elections despite their majority because of the Giscard-Chirac 
rivalry. According to Julliard, Balladur is liked more because 
"he is not them" than for himself. It should be noted that it 
is not in the prime minister's interest to have Giscard 
disappear from the scene too early, he adds, for Balladur would 
lose his position of arbiter, thus dividing his own party. 
  3. The alibi of powerlessness. The French no longer expect 
much from politicians on unemployment, the subject that 
interests them most, Julliard contends. They do not think 
Balladur is more efficient than others. Instead, they are 
resigned to his presence as "more presentable" and "least 
affected by the scandals of previous years." Polls do not 
measure his popularity, but his "persistent nonimpopularity," 
Julliard affirms. 
  4. The prime minister's early presidentialization. The 
French have understood that a sitting president, affected by his 
party's defeat last March and no longer a candidate, has lost 
his essential powers. As a result, the prime minister is now 
seen as a "veritable president" or a "viceroy," and is hence 
"credited with the success of power and exonerated of its 
failures." 
  From the above, it is clear that Balladur's popularity 
depends neither on his qualities nor on his personal defects. 
Therefore, today's favorable circumstances may well turn to his 
detriment tomorrow, Julliard concludes. 
<H3>  Balladur's 
Popularity Loss </H3>
  The root cause of Balladur's recent difficulties, for which 
he is already paying in the polls, is that he did not take 
sufficiently into account the contradictions in the French 
people's state of mind, "J.P." contends in the 15 February LE 
QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS. In fact, he continues, while the French do 
not like their governments to create upheavals, they do expect 
them to produce rapid and consequent results. The prime 
minister has not efficiently responded to the concerns and 
impatience of the French, "J.P." writes. It is possible that 
Balladur would be no more successful even if he adopted a more 
activist course. However, those within the majority who contest 
him could express their differences by criticizing the prime 
minister's method and not the man himself, thus "saving face," 
"J.P." counsels. In addition, Balladur's simple reforms have 
provided Chirac with a strong argument, he continues. The RPR 
leader can explain--and has not failed to do so--that real 
change will only occur after next year's presidential elections, 
since Mitterrand's presence mandates that only "reforms" be 
carried out at this time. Thus the very "modesty" of the term 
plays against him, "J.P." contends.

<F P=106> [Article signed M. G.: "The DREE Wants To Favor Strategic </F>
Analysis"] 
  [Text] After having been criticized by 
companies, the Directorate of Foreign Economic Relations (DREE), 
under the leadership of its new director, Jean-Pierre Landau, 
intends to intensify its warning role by multiplying its 
strategic analysis of information furnished by foreign posts. 
  Brand new as the head of DREE in July 1993, Landau had 
already decided on his priorities: the development of large 
macroeconomic analyses while favoring forecast and assessments 
of each country. Nearly seven months after taking over his 
duties, three of which were devoted to GATT, Landau has kept his 
word if one can judge by the rare confidences of bureaucrats, 
many of whom have reverted to the former pratice of refusing 
comment. Foreign posts have received orders to "massively" 
increase the information they gather, whether macroeconomic or 
microeconomic -- "We have been inundated with requests from 
Paris," an adviser explained -- for top officials to digest in 
the Finance Minister. 
  The idea is to make of DREE "an action tool, of reflection, 
of warning and forecasting analyses." We have been assigned a 
mission, another adviser affirms, "to capture all international 
signals in order that they can be then translated into strategic 
analyses." In sum, the DREE would become an immense watch and 
warning network. 
  This reorientation begs a certain number of questions on the 
future of the directorate, currently under the supervision of 
two ministries: The questions are fed by the recurrent rumor 
that the DREE will merge with Treasury. The plan seems all the 
more plausible this time since many experts, one of which is the 
director of the DREE, believes that there is no difference 
between currency, trade, and investment; between the national 
and international economy; and that France's foreign 
interactions goes well beyond the trade balance. 
  Moreover, in a context of restricted budgets and layoffs and 
while the need for a greater professionalism is clearly evident, 
the search for synergies would justify such an approach. For 
certain, this could even take place as soon as 1995. Some 
believe that this is the mission which Jean-Pierre Landau had 
set for himself when he was nominated. In this event, what 
would become of the other mission of the DREE, namely the 
support it gives to companies? 
  In the near term, such support is not threatened, no more so 
than is the billing office for ad hoc services rendered to 
exporters. In the medium term, however, this role could be 
assumed by the parastatal support organizations for foreign 
trade (CFCE, Council of European Trade Federations; CFME 
[expansion unknown]; ACTlM [expansion unknown]). Among 
employers, the Desgeorges report (not yet published) foretells 
the privatization of this function. 
<H3>  Ouestions and 
Innovations </H3>
  Parallel to these strategic questions, some innovations in 
the management of personnel, and more precisely in career 
tracks, augment the conversations in the corridors of the DREE. 
Competition for assignments as foreign post commercial 
counselors is open: As a rule, slots for these jobs will have 
the largest pool of candidates in the future. The network will 
be reinvigorated: Reinforcing the inspector general's office 
will allow it to inspect not only all the posts in three years 
but also to counsel them more effectively. 
  This policy is going to lead to renewing, in the long term, 
10 percent to 15 percent of the work force in these expanding 
careers. Top management in the central administration will also 
be shaken up. Merit promotion initiated by the former director, 
Jacques Desponts, will continue and be reinforced. Better 
still, it is no longer obligatory to have been bureau chief to 
become deputy director. A small cultural revolution.

<TEXT>
Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Several articles in the French press 
have noted new arrivals in the staffs of politicians and large 
companies. 
<H5>  New Faces in Le Pen's Staff </H5>
  According to the 12 February Paris weekly LE POINT, the 
extreme rightist National Front's (FN) lack of an executive 
bureau is compensated by leader Jean-Marie Le Pen's close circle 
of aides. In addition to "old comrade" Dominique Chaboche, Carl 
Lang and Bruno Megret are still secretary general and general 
delegate respectively. However, two new "consummate politicians" 
have joined the circle. University professor Bruno Gollinisch, 
44, is the better known of the two. A speaker of Japanese, 
Malayan and Indonesian, he is FN vice president for 
international affairs. A cultured man, he climbed up the FN 
ladder in 10 years, and "astutely mixes vituperation and 
political sense." Jean-Pierre Reveau is a long-time Le Pen 
friend who "holds the FN purse strings." While the new arrivals 
indicate that a "combat front" is being formed with a view to 
the presidential elections, they also denote the concern to 
achieve internal equilibrium, the article contends. 
"Independent" Gollinisch and Reveau were selected to 
counterbalance the increasing powers of Megret, many of whose 
partisans entered the party's central committee following the 
last FN congress which was characterized by "clan rivalries" 
denounced by Le Pen. 
<H5>  Privatized Phone-Poulenc's Staff </H5>
  The privatization of the Rhone-Poulenc company last November 
brought no changes in the firm's leadership, according to the 5 
February LE POINT. Polytechnic graduate Jean-Rene Fourtou, 54, 
remains president, with Jean-Marc Bruel, 57, as vice president 
in charge of quality and environmental issues. Fifty-five-year 
old Philippe Desmarescaux, director general, is responsible for 
basic chemistry, research and development, as well as for the 
group's activities in the United States. More important still is 
Igor Landau, 49, director general in charge of the health 
sector, which now represents 40 percent of the company's 
business. Next to the above group are four "key" officials: 
Jean-Pierre Trifoulet, 42, a graduate of the prestigious 
National School of Administration (ENA), who has been promoted 
rapidly; Brazilian engineer Edson Musa, 55, in charge of the 
important South America branch; new arrival Robert Cawthorn, 58, 
an Englishman responsible for Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer (RPR), the 
U.S. affiliate; and Michel de Rosen, 42, "the real RPR boss," 
formerly director of Minister of Industrial Development Alain 
Madelin's cabinet. 
<H5>  Balladur's `Galaxy' </H5>
  Writing in the 16 February Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE 
PARIS, 
Jean-Fancois Robert lists the "galaxy" of officials appointed by 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to ensure a smooth transition to 
the new state of economic affairs, as well as the "faithfulness" 
of the leaders of large groups and companies. 
Jacques Friedmann, 61, ENA graduate, former aide to Union for 
French Democracy (UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Rally 
for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, has been appointed 
president of the UAP insurance group that will soon be 
privatized. Endowed with "common sense" and very influential, 
Friedmann has also been put in charge of the Chinese market, 
Robert remarks. 
  ENA graduate Philippe Jaffre, 48, was adviser to Minister of 
Finance Rene Monory in 1979, then director of the Stern bank, 
and finally director of the National Agricultural Fund in 1988. 
Jaffre is now president of the soon-to-be privatized 
Elf-Aquitaine, which occupies a major place in government policy. 
  Polytechnic and ENA graduate Michel Pebereau, 52, a Treasury 
man, is seen by Robert as an "astute strategist" and "resolute 
free-market advocate." A Balladur adviser during the first 
cohabitation, Pebereau was put at the helm of the Credit 
Commercial of France on the eve of its privatization. He was so 
successful that he was also made head of the National Bank of 
Paris, "the banker of all French companies." 
  Polytechnic graduate Pierre Suard, 59, a scientist with ties 
to successive cabinets, is a "redoubtable strategist and 
negotiator," Robert comments. Formerly Alcatel-Alsthom director, 
he is now preparing to take over control of the Framatome 
company, nationalized by the Socialists. 
  ENA graduate Marc Vienot, 65, a faithful Balladur follower, 
spent the major part of his career at the Societe Generale bank. 
Since the bank owns shares in numerous privatized or soon-to-be 
privatized groups, Vienot's role is seen as "strategic," Robert 
concludes.

<F P=106> [Article by Patrick Marx: "Aeronautics -- Airbus </F>
Strengthens Its Industrial Presence in China"] 
  [Text] Despite U.S. competition, the European constructor 
has not given up on establishing itself on the Chinese market. 
Indeed, the company has just signed an agreement to involve 
more local companies in the provision of parts for its aircraft. 
  Airbus Industrie, which sold 18 aircraft to China in 1993, 
decided to hold out on Boeing, which sold 46 that same year (14 
percent of its deliveries -- LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES editor's note) 
on this market which analysts believe boasts tremendous 
potential in 10 years or so. In fact, the European consortium 
has just signed an agreement with China Aviation Supplies 
Corporation aimed at extending existing forms of industrial 
cooperation with other Chinese entities, like the Xian Aircraft 
Company, based in Shanxi province, and the Shenyang Aircraft 
Corporation, in Liaoning. These companies produce doors for all 
the European large aircraft and emergency exits for the small 
machines. The new agreement covers the delivery of various 
parts used in the manufacture and maintenance of aircraft, and 
is worth several hundred million dollars. 
  The three main constructors -- Boeing, Airbus Industrie, and 
McDonnell Douglas -- are locked in a merciless confrontation on 
the Chinese market. 
  This market is experiencing one of the strongest surges of 
growth in the world, with an upward curve of 20 to 30 percent, 
with some aircraft manufacturers not hesitating to rank it as a 
top priority -- together with the Japanese market, and with the 
exception of the United States -- for the next 16 years. 
According to the agreed predictions, growth in the 
Asian-Pacific area should represent an outlet for 3,000 
airliners worth something like 1,500 billion francs [Fr] between 
now and the year 2010. This growth will supposedly be led by 
China, which could alone account for between 600 and 800 
aircraft worth more than Fr230 billion. 
<H5>  China 75 Percent Equipped by Boeing </H5>
  In order to gain a lasting foothold in this eldorado, the 
aircraft manufacturers are making eyes at Beijing, and proposing 
to involve the country in the production process, thereby 
helping China to familiarize itself with the various aeronautic 
technologies. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have already found 
suppliers there. Indeed, after a first industrial agreement 
signed in 1985, McDonnell Douglas even launched the coproduction 
of short and medium range aircraft in the MD-90 and MD-95 range 
together with the Shangai [as published] Aviation Industry 
Group. Three-fourths of the Western aircraft comprising the 
fleet of Chinese airlines are Boeing machines. Moreover, the 
U.S. company is not hesitating to weigh up the pros and cons of 
negotiating the "most favored nation status" clause attributed 
to China in order to boost sales. 
  Airbus Industrie is lagging behind the United States. The 
GIE [Economic Interest Group], which is involved in 
international cooperation via 1,500 suppliers in 27 countries, 
has just set up a new base in China which will cover commercial, 
industrial, and after-sales service activities, the management 
of which was entrusted to Rolf Hue, previously the regional 
sales manager for the Pacific. From this post, he will also 
cover Hong Kong (where two other clients, Cathay Pacific and 
Dragonair, are based -- LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES editor's note) and 
Macao. Now he will have to consolidate the agreement which has 
just been concluded with China Aviation Supplies Corporation.

  [Text] Following his talks at the UN headquarters last 
night, Dr. Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign 
affairs minister of the Republic of Croatia, held talks in Paris 
today with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. Here is what 
Croatian TV correspondent Jozo Curic has to say about it: 
  [Curic] French Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe said 
that 
his country supported and valued the Washington agreement 
between the Croats and the Muslims. During a meeting with 
Granic here in Paris this afternoon, Juppe described the 
agreement as the first step and stressed the need for a 
demarcation and talks with the Serbs. France especially greeted 
America's greater involvement, saying that finding a solution 
was both a global and European problem. The diplomatic stimulus 
must come from both the European Union and the United States, 
and Russia, Juppe said. Speaking to journalists after the 
talks, Juppe said that Paris supported the Croat-Muslim 
arrangement. 
  Granic spoke about the problem of UNPA's [United Nations 
Protected Areas] in Croatia. Juppe responded by saying that 
UNPA's were part of the Kinkel-Juppe plan. Granic said that 
Croatia insisted on a more relevant UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] mandate, especially in protecting borders and 
communications, disarmament, confidence-building measures, and 
economic recovery in the UNPA's. Croatia calls for a stricter 
UNPROFOR mandate including the use of an ultimatum. To this 
end, Croatia asked for France's help. 
  Official Paris supported the efforts to normalize Croatia's 
relations with the Serbs and approved of the Croatian 
Government's political approach, Granic said following the 
talks. He told journalists in the French Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs that Croatia wanted to normalize relations with Belgrade 
but wanted to do so in conjunction with the resolution of the 
UNPA issue. We wish to revitalize the Kinkel-Juppe initiative. 
To this end, we expect support from the EU [European Union], 
the United States, and the UN Security Council, Granic said. He 
added: We fully agree with the French standpoint that there can 
be no peace without the third side. An agreement will be 
offered to the third side. 
  Granic said that he highly valued Frances' role and Juppe's 
role, in particular, in the efforts to resolve the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and especially in Croatia. France favors a 
realistic solution. 
  The talks were attended by Ambassador Salaj and Matek, head 
of (?Granic's) office. Granic informed Juppe about the details 
of the interim Washington agreement.

<F P=106> [Article signed PVDM: "Willy Claes Paying Working Visit to </F>
Mitterand and Juppe"] 
  [Text] Paris -- "Europeans, Americans, and Russians should 
now get together in order to get new peace talks on Bosnia 
going. We must take advantage of the present opportunities." 
Foreign Minister Willy Claes reiterated this position in Paris 
yesterday, after meeting with President Francois Mitterrand and 
his colleague Alain Juppe. 
  Claes was in Paris on a working visit. He reported to his 
colleague Juppe on the talks on European Union [EU] enlargement. 
Both ministers also discussed the financing of the common 
foreign policy. Some members of the Union argue it should be 
financed by special contributions from the member states. 
"However, we can hardly develop a common policy, if, with every 
action, we must discuss who will pay what," Claes stated. 
  France has now suggested eastablishment of a fund which 
would 
be financed partly by Community funds and partly by member state 
contributions. "This seems to be a good working hypothesis," 
Claes said. 
  With Mitterrand, the Belgian minister talked mainly about 
the 
situation in Rwanda and Burundi, where he was on a visit last 
week, and about Zaire. 
  With his counterparts, Claes also made preparations for the 
Paris Conference. Last December's European Summit in Brussels 
adopted French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's idea of a 
Security Pact in Europe. 
  Belgium fears that this conference might be pointless, 
unless 
one succeeds in getting countries such as Slovakia and Romania, 
which are showing little interest, around the table. The 
purpose of the conference, scheduled to start in Paris next 
April, is precisely to convice the countries of Central and East 
Europe, including Russia, to reach agreements concerning their 
borders and respect of minorities on their territories.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: France-Iraq: "The Resumption of Talks </F>
Is Confirmed"] 
  [Text] By welcoming high-ranking Iraqi officials in a span 
of a few days and mentioning the "progress" made by Iraq on the 
disarmament issue, France is expressing the wish to see that 
country reintegrated into the international community if it 
meets its commitments. 
  A Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] spokesman has confirmed 
that Mr. Riyad al-Qayssi, director of international affairs at 
the Iraqi foreign ministry, will arrive in Paris today for 
discussions. "We will explain to the Iraqi official that it is 
in his country's interest to quickly implement the UN 
resolutions," the Foreign Ministry communique said. 
  This visit comes less than a week after a high-ranking Iraqi 
Oil Ministry official arrived in France at the invitation of the 
Total and Elf-Aquitaine companies, which have been negotiating 
contracts for the exploration of oil sources in southern Iraq 
once the embargo is lifted. On Wednesday [3 March], for the 
first time, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe explicitly 
hinted at the "progress" made by Iraq. Some months ago, he 
talked about Baghdad's "wider openness" in applying the UN 
resolutions. 
  After his latest mission to Bagdhad, Rolf Ekeus, chief of 
the 
UN commission on disarmament, and Iraqi officials said that they 
were ready to accelerate setting up a mechanism aimed at 
controlling Iraq's armaments in order to allow the oil embargo 
to be lifted. Once this mechanism is agreed upon, Iraq will have 
to wait for a "probationary" period of six months before a UN 
decision in its favor can be made. Alain Juppe, who remains 
very cautious, stressed that several other resolutions have not 
yet been respected by Baghdad, such as the inviolability of 
Iraq's border with Kuwait. Juppe considers those resolutions as 
a "sine qua non condition" for Iraq's reintegration into the 
international community. French diplomatic sources say that it 
is unlikely that the sanctions will be lifted at the next 
Security Council meeting in March which will be chaired by 
France. 
  Nevertheless, things seem to be improving on the bilateral 
level, evidenced by the opening of an "Iraqi interests section" 
in Paris in September 1993 (the two countries ceased all 
diplomatic relations in February 1991) and by the visit to 
France in mid-October -- officially for "health reasons" -- of 
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, March 4 (AFP) -- A month before the 
formal conclusion of GATT's Uruguay Round of trade 
liberalization, officials of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade are obviously worried by the U.S.-Japanese clash over 
trade -- but refuse to believe a trade war is inevitable. 
[passage omitted] 
  At the very time Washington was announcing the decision, 
GATT 
director general Peter Sutherland warned in New York against the 
new outbreak of trade tensions challenging the gains resulting 
from the Uruguay Round "before they are even completely 
operational." 
  Sutherland particularly criticized the "managed trade" 
approach he said Washington is pressuring Tokyo to accept, in 
the form of quantitative targets for some bilateral trade, 
boosting Japanese imports of U.S. products and limiting Japan's 
exports to the United States. Japan has firmly rejected this 
approach so far. 
  Sutherland thinks such agreements are dangerous, 
constituting 
a distortion of the multilateral trade system -- and in case of 
conflict, they tempt the players to retaliate, since such 
accords are outside GATT and its rules. [passage omitted] 
  On Friday [4 March], GATT spokesman David Woods tried to 
downplay the effect of the latest U.S. measure, saying that "We 
need to be clear as to what re-enactment of 301 may mean and 
keep a sense of proportion about yesterday's announcement. The 
use of any retaliatory weapons is only challengeable if and when 
that use is in conflict with the application of GATT rules. At 
present there is no evidence that the U.S. intends to violate 
its obligations."

  [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
sees the U.S. decision to reinstate its Super 301 trade sanction 
law as a warning to both Europe and Japan, a senior EU 
negotiator said here Friday [4 March]. 
  He was reacting to the decision by President Bill Clinton to 
reactivate Super 301, which allows him to order punitive tariffs 
of up to 100 percent on a country that continues to obstruct 
imports of U.S. products. 
  The move was aimed at Japan's trade surplus with the United 
States following Tokyo's refusal to accept numerical targets for 
opening its market to American goods. 
  The EU negotiator, who asked not to be named, quoted the 
U.S. 
Administration as saying the move would be limited to areas of 
trade not dealt with in the Uruguay Round of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  This could mean that the United States could use Super 301 
as 
a threat in current negotiations with the European Union to open 
up public contracts to full competition by 1996, he said. 
  The two sides are negotiating certain areas in public 
procurement omitted from a deal struck among the European Union, 
the United States and 10 other countries last December to open 
up the sector. They are trying to reach agreement by April 15. 
  The European Union has said it will exclude U.S. tenderers 
from telecommunications contracts until European firms have full 
access to American public contracts offered below Federal 
Government level. 
  The EU negotiator said Washington could use Super 301 to 
force open the European telecommunications market if the dispute 
was not settled by the time the Uruguay Round is formally signed 
in Marrakesh on April 15. 
  "That is why the U.S. decision (to reactivate Super 301) 
must 
be considered as a serious warning," he said. 
  But the official added that the United States was not 
expected to use its trade weapon in another area excluded from 
the Uruguay Round -- the audiovisual sector where the European 
Union is officially discriminating against U.S. films and 
television programmes. 
  The issue is on the agenda of a meeting of EU foreign 
ministers here on Monday and Tuesday. The ministers are due to 
discuss the European Union's possibilities of trade reprisals. 
  Earlier Friday, EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said the 
U.S. decision to resurrenct Super 301 was disappointing. 
Officials said he had telephoned U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor to express European concern. Brittan said the 
European Union would be studying the move carefully to see if it 
violated U.S. trade commitments, particularly in the Uruguay 
Round, despite Kantor's assurances to the contrary. 
  In London on Thursday, former British premier Margaret 
Thatcher said U.S. pressure on Japan was "a step backwards." 
She said: "Only by freeing the Japanese market from regulation 
and interference will you make it more open." 
  A similar approach has been taken by Brittan. Last month he 
announced a twin programme to make European goods more 
attractive to the Japanese, while at the same time using 
diplomatic pressure to overcome market access difficulties. 
  But he came out in opposition to numerical targets and trade 
quotas. 
  And in a bid to help defuse the trade tension between Tokyo 
and Washington, Brittan suggested a "trilateral approach" in 
which the three sides would work together to overcome Japanese 
trade barriers. 
  EU officials said his offer had not received an enthusiastic 
response from Washington. 
  [In Paris, French Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard 
Longuet said Friday afternoon that "France condemns any recourse 
to a unilateral instrument" in the trade field, referring to the 
reinstatement of "Super 301." 
  [He said in a communique that "the idea we have of the U.S. 
role in the world is hard to reconcile with a method that can 
hit any country at any time, if a country enjoys strong 
competitiveness to the detriment of American interests." 
  [The minister added that the retaliatory device, "applied to 
offset a structural deficit, the U.S. deficit with Japan, is not 
of such nature as to resolve the problem."] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, March 5 (TANJUG) -- Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias said here on Saturday [5 March] the European 
Union would present new ideas on Bosnia-Herzegovina which would 
basically rely on its peace plan for that war-torn former 
Yugoslav republic. 
  Asked by TANJUG what the EU, which is currently chaired by 
Greece, planned to do following the U.S. initiative for a 
Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, Papoulias said Europe would 
come out with its own ideas on how to resolve the crisis. 
  Acting under strong pressure from Washington, Bosnian Moslem 
and Croat officials met in Washington on Tuesday to sign a 
preliminary deal on forming a binational federation, which would 
subsequently form confederate ties with neighbouring Croatia. 
  Washington's idea is to use the binational federation 
manoeuvre to enable the Moslems to preserve the integrity of 
Bosnia, expand the territory under their control, give them 
access to the sea and, finally, create a strong negotiating (and 
possibly military) bloc against the Serbs. 
  In Cairo, Papoulias met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for 
talks on various issues, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, but he 
did not elaborate on that point. 
  Egypt has cautiously welcomed the Moslem-Croat rapprochement 
under Washington's auspices, but the government-controlled press 
has been writing over the past few days the latest developments 
clearly indicate that Bosnia will be divided and that its days 
in the present shape are numbered. 
  Bosnian Serbs, who were not invited to the talks in 
Washington, formed their own republic in 1992 in their ethnic 
and historical territories.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Britain was today stepping up pressure on its allies 
to send extra troops to Bosnia as part of a wider international 
effort to prevent the collapse of the fragile cease-fire. 
  The Government is increasingly willing to commit more 
manpower to the region in response to the urgent United Nations 
plea for 10,650 more soldiers. But Ministers are awaiting a 
firm commitment from other countries before agreeing to the UN 
request. 
  The UN commander in Bosnia, Britain's Lieutenant General Sir 
Michael Rose, said it would be "a disappointment" if the UN did 
not get the extra troops. 
  Initial responses to the UN plea indicated that a lot of 
background diplomatic work will be needed to put together a 
substantial international force. 
  The Clinton Administration said its decision not to deploy 
U.S. ground troops in Bosnia remained unchanged. And reports 
from the UN in New York said France, which already has 6,000 
troops in the former Yugoslavia, was also refusing to send more. 
However, there are a total of 24 countries with soldiers on the 
ground in the region and Britain is expected to put pressure on 
these. 
  There is also expected to be a move to allow Italy, which 
has 
so far kept out of the region for historical reasons, to send 
troops. "One can expect significant behind-the-scenes work to 
persuade other countries to commit more troops," said a 
Whitehall source. "This would then clear the way for Britain to 
increase the number of troops it has in the region." 
  France has indicated it may bring forward the deployment of 
its replacement forces to create an overlap of several weeks, 
thus providing thousands more men for a short period. 
  Cabinet Ministers have decided against withdrawing the 
2,500- 
strong UK humanitarian force, and will go ahead with the 
replacement of the Coldstream Guards by the 2nd Battalion the 
Royal Anglian Regiment in May. 
  However, the Army says it would be difficult to mirror the 
French move as the battalion is equipped with Warrior armoured 
vehicles and the extra necessary logistics would be substantial. 
  In addition, Lt. Gen. Rose is looking for lightly armoured 
mobile infantry to police the cease-fire. The Army has two 
infantry battalions equipped with Saxon armoured cars already 
painted in UN white colours, which would be ideal for 
peacekeeping operations. Either the Green Howards or the Duke 
of Wellington's Regiment could be sent quickly to Bosnia with 
their 64 Saxons and logistics back-up by sea and air. 
  Lt. Gen. Rose said the reaction of the international 
community so far was a disappointment. "If we are not going to 
get the troops we need we will have to go on as we are, which is 
to `misuse' troops from other tasks and bring them over to help 
with the process of developing the ceasefire plan in central 
Bosnia and around Sarajevo," he said. "We have been a bit slow 
in getting to the situation because we do not have the troops in 
sufficient strength around the 70-kilometre confrontation line." 
It was too strong to suggest the cease-fire was in "jeopardy" 
because of the shortage of troops but the process was "very 
fragile." 
  Shadow defence secretary Dr. David Clark called on the Prime 
Minister to "stop messing around" and send in more troops. He 
said. "I want to stop the slaughter. The peace will only hold 
if we get extra troops out there. It is about time the Prime 
Minister stopped messing around and sent them out." He added 
that the Americans "ought to put their money where their mouth 
is and send troops." 
  Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said: 
"The failure of the United States to offer any more troops for 
Bosnia could rupture the NATO alliance. All the good work 
achieved at the recent summit will be thrown away."

  [Text] Prague, March 5 (TANJUG) -- The Committee of Senior 
Officials of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (CSCE) meeting in Prague called for the early return of 
its missions to Kosovo, Sandzak and Vojvodina in the Yugoslav 
Republic of Serbia. 
  The CSCE missions' mandate in Yugoslavia expired less than a 
year ago and Belgrade has made its extension conditional upon 
Yugoslavia's return to the CSCE. Yugoslavia was suspended from 
the organization in July 1992 for its alleged involvement in war 
in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The CSCE committee said in a written statement late on 
Friday 
[4 March] that the return of the missions should be 
"unconditional." 
  Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, where the first 
Serbian 
state was created in the early Middle Ages, is mostly populated 
by the ethnic Albanian minority. The northern province of 
Vojvodina and the Sandzak region in the southwest are partly 
populated by ethnic Hungarians and Moslems, respectively. 
  The CSCE committee did not accept an initiative launched by 
a 
group of CSCE member-states to form a permanent CSCE forum for 
military stability and security in former Yugoslavia, which 
would also work for disarmament and confidence building in the 
area. 
  Slovenia and Croatia violently seceded from the former 
Yugoslav six-member federation in mid-1991. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession early in 1992 triggered the 
war which is still going on between its Moslem, Serb and Croat 
communities. 
  The Former southernmost Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
followed suit so that Yugoslavia now consists of Serbia and 
Montenegro. 
  The CSCE committee was divided over the establishment of a 
military stability forum because Russia and Greece urged a 
slower and more gradual approach, while Austria, Croatia, 
Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which initiated the idea -- 
insisted that the body be formed without delay.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
and Norway began a new round of high-level talks here Sunday [6 
March] over a fisheries dispute which is blocking Oslo's entry 
into an enlarged union along with Austria, Finland and Sweden. 
  Diplomats said Norway was sticking firmly to its 
longstanding 
refusal to give EU fishing fleets, mainly Spanish, increased 
access to fish-rich Norwegian waters as part of its price for 
membership. 
  Spain has been pushing for the right to take 14,000 tonnes 
of 
fish a year from Norwegian waters when Oslo enters the grouping 
-- less than one percent of the annual Norwegian catch. 
  Norway's ministers of fisheries, Jan Henry T. Olsen, and of 
trade, Grete Knudsen, pursued talks on the issue here Sunday 
with several EU ministers including Theodoros Pangalos, chairman 
of the EU's Council of Ministers. 
  Knudsen would say only that the two sides had been engaged 
in 
"positive dialogue." The talks are expected to continue through 
most of the week. 
  Agreement must be reached by Thursday if Norway is to meet a 
target of January 1 to enter the European Union with the other 
three newcomers, which agreed on membership terms last Tuesday 
after a year of tough negotiations. 
  The issue is crucially important for Norway, where 
preservation of fishing communities is an emotional political 
issue, and in Spain, which is trying to wring maximum benefit 
from bringing newcomers into the EU. 
  "We want a satisfactory conclusion in fish and 
institutions," 
Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said in an interview with 
Spanish television on Sunday. 
  His reference to "institutions" applies to a row over voting 
rights in the EU Council of Ministers -- its main 
decision-making body -- which is threatening to torpedo the 
enlargement negotiations for all four applicants. 
  Britain and Spain are trying to freeze voting procedures so 
that entry of the newcomers does not tilt the balance of power 
from bigger to smaller EU countries and so that it is easier to 
block controversial decisions. 
  Both countries have said they will not budge on the issue, 
which will be discussed at a meeting of EU foreign ministers 
here on Monday and Tuesday. 
  Diplomats say the meeting might drag on through the week 
because, without a solution, the Union will be unable to 
complete the enlargement negotiations in time to submit the 
result to the European Parliament by Thursday. 
  This would mean, in turn, that it would become almost 
impossible to complete ratification of the negotiations in time 
to admit the newcomers on January 1. 
  A British official said: "There are two good card players at 
the table. The Spanish are very good and everyone knows the 
Norwegians are unbeatable.... I don't think the Norwegians know 
yet what they can get away with." 
  The Norwegian negotiators say they must return home with a 
good result on fish, otherwise the Norwegian electorate might 
say "no" to membership of the EU in the mandatory pre-entry 
referendum. 
  This happened before. Norway was set to join the European 
Economic Community, as it was then called, in 1972 along with 
Denmark, Britain and Ireland. 
  But Norway voted "no" because it would not submit to 
fisheries policies from Brussels. 
  Compromise might be easier this time because, with Finland 
and Sweden ready to join the Union, Norway would be isolated in 
Scandinavia if it said "no" again. But nobody is ready to 
predict the result of this week's talks.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 7 (AFP) -- Norway and Spain 
maintained their inflexible stand here Monday [7 March] in a 
dispute over fish which is blocking Norway's entry into the 
European Union [EU], EU officials said here Monday. 
  They added that there was also little progress in an 
internal 
EU row over voting procedures which is threatening to wreck the 
chances of Austria, Finland and Sweden entering the Union along 
with Norway on January 1. 
  But Oslo and the European Union moved closer to a deal in a 
related dispute, with Norway indicating it might accept limits 
on its fish exports to the Union if it were allowed temporary 
protection for its food processing industry. 
  The officials were speaking after a negotiating session 
between delegations of EU and Norwegian ministers in the margins 
of an EU foreign ministers meeting. 
  They said the January 1 deadline for enlarging the European 
Union would almost certainly be missed if the two disputes were 
not solved by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. 
  Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said Monday: "We 
remain firm. There is no room for manoeuvre. We hope reason 
will prevail." 
  On the other extreme, Norwegian Trade Minister Grete Knudsen 
reiterated Norway's refusal to grant extra catch quotas to EU 
fishing fleets as demanded by Spain. 
  She reported "substantial progress" in other aspects of 
negotiations with the European Union, notably concerning 
agriculture, customs duties and restrictions on the purchase of 
holiday homes by foreigners. 
  Knudsen also indicated that Norway might accept temporary EU 
limits on imports of cheap Norwegian fish when Oslo joins the 
Union, if it could offer similar protection to its own food 
processing industry. 
  The trade-off would have no effect on Spain, which wants the 
European Union given extra catch quotas of 18,000 tonnes of fish 
in Norwegian waters. 
  This is less than one percent of Norway's total catch and 
the 
Spanish want 14,000 tonnes of it for themselves. 
  But Knudsen said during Monday's early negotiations that 
Norway was not prepared to relax its efficient management of 
fish resources by allowing the European Union to take any more 
fish than they do by existing accords. 
  The two sides were due to hold more negotiations later in 
the 
day. The Greek president of the EU Council of Ministers, 
Theodoros Pangalos, said he hoped for a package deal with Norway 
by late Tuesday. 
  "The issue must be wrapped up this week. The first one to 
blink loses," an EU official said. 
  The EU foreign ministers were also scheduled to hold a 
top-secret internal negotiating session later in the day on the 
row over voting procedures when the applicants join the European 
Union. 
  Britain and Spain are trying to retain the current voting 
system in the European Union's Council of Ministers -- its main 
decision-making organ -- where two large countries and one small 
one can block decisions. 
  Other EU countries maintain that this rule should be relaxed 
to take account of the Union's enlargement, so that the entry of 
four more members does not make decision-making more difficult. 
  Under the current system of weighted voting where big 
countries have more influence than small ones, 23 votes out of 
76 -- 30 percent -- are sufficient to constitute a blocking 
majority. 
  With the entry of the four newcomers, the blocking ratio 
should logically change to 27 out of 90. One small and two big 
countries would no longer be enough to block decisions. 
  For Britain, this means that a free trade block of Germany, 
Britain and Denmark would no longer be able to hold up such 
restrictions on trade as anti-dumping measures. 
  And Spain, Italy and Portugal would no longer be assured of 
protecting their Mediterrannean agricultural interests. Spain 
and Britain gave no signs on Monday that they were prepared to 
yield.

  [Text] Brussels, March 4 (AFP) -- France, Germany and 
Britain rejected demands from the European Parliament here 
Friday [4 March] to add ECU400 million (450 million dollars) to 
a five-year research budget of ECU13 billion (15 billion 
dollars). 
  Diplomats said an EU [European Union] research ministerial 
council had called a meeting of a special conciliation committee 
created under the Maastricht Treaty to arbitrate differences 
between the council and the Euro-parliament. 
  The parliament wants more money spent on research, but the 
diplomats quoted the French, German and British research 
ministers as saying there was no excuse for lavish spending in a 
time of economic recession. The council had originally budgeted 
ECU11 billion (12.4 billion dollars) for research spending 
between 1994 and 1998, and the Parliament had demanded ECU14 
billion (15.8 billion dollars). Eventually the council settled 
on ECU12 billion plus a "reserve" of another billion -- 400 
million dollars less than what the Parliament decided was its 
bottom line. 
  The conciliation committee comprises 12 EU ministers and 12 
Euro-MP's. It has 12 weeks to find a compromise. The budget 
aims at funding research mainly in information, communication, 
industrial and environmental technologies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "36 Million Pound EU Boost for North </F>
Peace Fund Over Three Years"] 
  [Text] A 36 million pound contribution to peace efforts in 
the North was approved by the European Commission yesterday. 
  The cash will go the International Fund for Ireland [IFI] 
over the next three years, on top of 72 million pounds the EU 
[European Union] has provided since 1989. 
  The IFI was set up by the British and Irish Governments in 
1986 to promote reconciliation as well as providing social and 
economic aid for the North. 
  But the latest money from Brussels is being billed as a 
special response to the efforts of the two Governments to end 
violence. 
  Commission President Jacques Delors said yesterday's 
initiative should be seen as "an expression of practical support 
for the peace process in Northern Ireland" in the wake of the 
Downing Street Declaration. 
  The 36 million pounds will be used for projects aimed at 
bridging the religious divide. 
  The Commission emphasised that the 36 million pounds was in 
addition to assistance to Northern Ireland already assured under 
the EU's regional and social funds. 
  The IFI is managed by an independent board appointed by the 
two Governments. It also receives contributions from America, 
Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

<F P=106> [Xavier Gautier report: "French-German-Polish Maneuvers"] </F>
  [Excerpt] France, Poland, and Germany will move into the 
"practical" phase of their closer defense relationship this year. 
  When Polish Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk visited 
Paris last Thursday [3 March], the three states agreed to 
organize a joint exercise between chiefs of staff followed by 
ground maneuvers by army units from each country. 
  Reliable sources say that these could take place next 
autumn, 
in all likelihood in Mourmelon [France]. The Polish Army will 
place one unit -- probably a company -- at the disposal of the 
French-German brigade and the Eurocorps. The principle has been 
agreed on, even if, as a matter of procedure, the other members 
of the Eurocorps (in particular Spain and Belgium) have yet to 
be consulted. 
  These decisions were announced at the end of a working 
dinner 
-- the first of its kind -- at the Hotel de Brienne [Defense 
Ministry] last Thursday evening and attended by [Defense 
Ministers] Francois Leotard, Volker Ruehe, and Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. During that meeting, an assessment was also made 
of the military cooperation between France and Poland over the 
past three years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [David Marsh article: "Excess Gives Way To Restraint"] </F>
  [Text] Just before Christmas, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, 
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, [EBRD] received a top-level visitor. Lord Lawson, 
former UK chancellor of the exchequer, now chairman of the 
Central Europe Trust consulting firm, dropped into the bank's 
London headquarters to offer some hints on channelling resources 
to East Europe. 
  "It's not that usual in my experience for an international 
civil servant to seek out the view of the private sector," says 
Mr Tom Lampl, one of the firm's managing directors, who 
accompanied Lord Lawson on his visit. "Normally they have their 
heads in the clouds playing politics. But he (de Larosiere) has 
his ear to the ground. He really wants to find things out." 
  Mr de Larosiere's keenness to listen illustrates just one 
way 
the public-sector bank has changed since his predecessor, Mr 
Jacques Attali, resigned last year at the height of a crisis 
caused by mismanagement and budgetary extravagance. 
  A former governor of the Bank of France and managing 
director 
of the International Monetary Fund, Mr de Larosiere has been 
carrying out a quiet revolution since he took over at the end of 
September. 
  He quickly concluded that the bank, established in 1991 with 
EculObn capital to provide loans and equity to the former 
communist bloc, had become too cumbersome and disorganised to 
carry out its mandate. 
  Mr de Larosiere has been squaring up to two principal tasks. 
First, he has had to win the support of the bank's 56 mainly 
government shareholders for measures to cut costs and increase 
efficiency. An important stage in the process was reached 
yesterday at the EBRD budget committee, which discussed Mr de 
Larosiere's proposal to maintain the bank's personnel and 
administrative spending for 1994 unchanged from 1993 at 116m 
pounds. The EBRD board is expected to approve the budget plan 
in three weeks. 
  Underlining the bank's problems in controlling expenses, the 
budget last year rose by roughly 50 percent compared with the 
start-up phase in 1992. 
  Second, he has been trying to improve long-term confidence 
that the bank can fulfill its aim of developing the nascent 
private sector in East Europe and the ex-Soviet Union. 
  Doubts whether the EBRD can meet this objective reflect the 
general deterioration of the political and economic environment 
in the East during the past two years, as well as the damage to 
its reputation caused by the Attali affair. 
  The EBRD's management crisis has focused attention on a 
fundamental contradiction in the bank's operations. It was 
established to provide additional resources to the former Soviet 
bloc. But it has to meet standards of extreme prudence in its 
investment policies -- one of the reasons why it has been 
frequently criticised for cumbersome administrative procedures. 
  The EBRD lends under fully commercial terms -- charging 
higher interest rates, for instance, than the European 
Investment Bank [EIB], the EU's [European Union] long-term 
lending institution, which competes with the EBRD in some areas 
of East Europe. 
  By the end of 1993, the EBRD had committed a cumulative 
ECU2.8 billion (2.1 billion pounds) and disbursed ECU556m in 2.5 
years of operations -- much less than originally planned. About 
57 percent of the bank's loans and equity investments have been 
channelled to the private sector and 43 percent to the public 
sector, compared with the 60/40 split called for in its statutes. 
  By contrast, the EIB, which is a shareholder in the EBRD, 
has 
so far committed ECUl.7 billion to East Europe, of which about 
half has been disbursed. In view of the EIB's limited 
engagement in East Europe compared with its overall lending, the 
EIB has, according to some critics of the EBRD, been much more 
effective in channelling resources to the former communist 
countries. 
  Under the leadership of Mr Attali, who as special adviser to 
French President Francois Mitterrand was the main inspiration 
behind the EBRD's foundation, the bank suffered from an acute 
imbalance between aspiration and reality. 
  Mr Attali's relationship with the bank's 23-member, 
London-based board was frequently adversarial. One EBRD insider 
says bluntly that Mr Attali was not trusted by big shareholder 
governments. 
  A former EBRD director contrasts Mr de Larosiere's sober and 
professional style with the "oppressive and domineering" manner 
with which Mr Attali used to handle board meetings. He says of 
the former president: "He felt it was his bank. He felt it was 
his property his child, he called it. I don't think he ever 
came to terms with the fact that it was owned by governments and 
the directors were representatives of its owners." 
  To put the bank's operations on to a more realistic footing, 
Mr de Larosiere has set a target for new commitments of ECUl.8 
billion this year the same as last year's actual total and much 
lower than the ECU2 billion to ECU2.6 billion originally 
budgeted by Mr Attali for 1993. 
  The bank has embarked on several new programmes, including 
ambitious plans to provide venture capital and loans for small 
businesses in Russia. However, since the EBRD's lending in 
coming years will remain below earlier expectations, it will 
continue to run the risk of looking top-heavy. 
  The bank now employs about 700 staff, since Mr Attali's 
original plans for 800 employees by the end of last year were 
never realised. One of Mr de Larosiere's first actions was to 
freeze creation of new posts. About 35 employees have left the 
bank since he arrived, and a large number of employees has been 
redeployed. The number of operational banking professionals has 
been increased by 25 percent to 250 people. 
  Mr Mario Sarcinelli -- currently third in command at the 
bank under Mr de Larosiere and Mr Ron Freeman, the senior vice 
president -- will leave next month after his appointment as the 
next head of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the Italian public 
sector bank. 
  However, so far Mr de Larosiere has brought in only two new 
people at a senior level. They are his principal aide, Mr 
Philippe Richard who came with him from the Bank of France, and 
Mr Claude Peyrot, a temporary management consultant -- known by 
some at the EBRD as "the secret weapon" -- who has also 
previously worked at the French central bank. 
  To gear the EBRD's activities more closely to the varying 
needs of the 25 diverse countries in which it operates, the 
president decided in November to merge the merchant and 
development banking departments, which previously handled 
private and public-sector business separately. 
  Mr de Larosiere is convinced that the bank previously failed 
to put sufficient emphasis on identifying profitable 
private-sector deals in its countries of operation. He was 
surprised to find that only 20 EBRD staff spoke Russian. 
  One director reports "strained nerves" as a result of Mr de 
Larosiere's insistence two months ago that five staff members 
move to Russia on secondment with local banks, as part of his 
efforts to decentralise operations. Mr de Larosiere wants to 
increase by 20 the bank's staff (both expatriates and local 
employees) in its 11 offices outside London -- a 50 percent 
increase from the present tally of 40. 
  He also wants to improve the bank's effectiveness by 
increasing the number of investment instruments at its disposal. 
Proposals under review include the ideas of taking more stakes 
in local banks and investment funds in its countries of 
operation, and providing guarantees to back private-sector loans 
for certain projects. 
  One problem, however, is that the EBRD's deals have become 
both smaller and more time-consuming as it tries to shift 
towards private sector business. Although the bank aims to 
multiply the effects of its investment through co-financing with 
other banks, it normally has to shoulder by itself the time and 
expense of credit analysis. "These are mainly borrowers without 
credit history," says one EBRD executive. "In practically every 
case we are starting from scratch." 
  Roughly 20 percent of the time of its 250 mainstream bankers 
is spent monitoring credit risks. Already there are signs of an 
increased need for write-offs on some investments, such as the 
alleged overvaluation of the EBRD's 20 percent stake in the 
Czech national airline. 
  Even though the bank's problems are by no means over, its 
main shareholders voice relief at the switch of presidency. Mr 
Lee Jackson, the deputy U.S. director at the bank, says: "He (Mr 
de Larosiere) has brought a greater degree of focus. My 
government and I are very supportive of what he is doing." 
  Mr Gunter Winkelmann, Germany's director at the EBRD, says: 
"There has been a dramatic improvement." Mr Attali stated in a 
recent book [Europe(s), published by Fayard, Paris 
1994 -- FINANCIAL TIMES editor's note] that he was toppled by a 
revolt against his own proposals last summer to restructure the 
bank and make it more efficient. Mr Winkelmann, however, 
refutes this claim. "That is not true... In the end, he (Mr 
Attali) was not accepted by the board, not accepted by the 
staff. It is this that brought him down." 
  Mr Tomas Parizek, director for the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Slovakia and Croatia, says Mr de Larosiere's decentralisation 
plans are "in the right direction." He emphasises that the bank 
should not simply put more bankers in the field, but should also 
find ways of increasing its effectiveness by injecting equity 
into banks and investment funds in its countries of operation. 
  On the ground in East Europe, the staff in the EBRD's 
present 
network of offices win few plaudits. One international 
investment banker in Budapest says he has met the EBRD's local 
staff only at parties and receptions. "These people are the 
worst kind of diplomats you can imagine," he says. "The best 
that they can do is set appointments." 
  Senior bankers in Poland say they deal with the EBRD's 
London 
headquarters rather than its Warsaw office when they want to do 
business. The World Bank's local office has much more of an 
operational function. In Prague -- where the EBRD is generally 
held to have played only a minor role in economic restructuring 
-- there is support for a stronger EBRD presence. 
"Decentralisation is a good thing, and the bank should be more 
willing to listen," says a senior fund manager in the Czech 
Republic. 
  For all the criticism to which it is accustomed, there are 
signs that the EBRD can find a useful role in areas where 
commercial banks are reluctant to lend. In association with a 
Russian state-owned oil enterprise, U.S. oil company Conoco last 
year borrowed $90 million from the EBRD for a $350 million oil 
project. Mr Mike Espinosa, Conoco's assistant treasurer, says 
he is "absolutely ecstatic" over the EBRD's track record, and 
contrasts its willingness to lend money to Russia with the 
excessive prudence shown by commercial banks. 
  Similarly, Mr Wayne Murdy, chief financial officer at 
Newmont 
Mining, the U.S.-based gold company, says he is "very 
complimentary" about the EBRD's work on a $105 million loan for 
a joint-venture gold mine in Uzbekistan. "We couldn't have got 
a commercial bank to take on a commitment in Uzbekistan without 
them." 
  Despite accolades like this, many would agree with the 
assessment of Mr Wolfgang Roth, the EIB's director responsible 
for East Europe, that the EBRD is "not basically necessary." An 
alternative three years ago, Mr Roth says, would have been to 
establish a joint subsidiary of the EIB and the World Bank. 
"But now we have it, we must make the best of it." 
  After Mr de Larosiere's initial moves to curb the bank's 
structural defects, the EBRD has regained the support of its 
shareholder governments. His hardest task, however, still lies 
ahead: to show during the next few years that the EBRD can make 
a real contribution to the development of functioning capitalist 
economies in the former communist bloc. In the meantime, the 
EBRD will remain highly vulnerable to political and economic 
setbacks in the countries it was set up to serve.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton's 301"] </F>
  [Text] Governments must choose between bilateral and 
multilateral approaches to trade policy. As Mr. Peter 
Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, observed in New York last week, that choice 
was not, in fact, made with the completion of the Uruguay Round 
last December. On the contrary, the United States believes that 
both can run in parallel. That is the significance of the 
revival by president Clinton of the "Super 301" trade provision. 
But he is mistaken. 
  "Super 301" is not particularly significant in itself. 
Certainly, it does not have to be used in ways contrary to the 
GATT. Revival of "Super 301" may even reduce congressional 
pressure for immediate action, giving both the United States and 
Japan a breathing space during which to resolve their current 
conflict. After the failure of last month's summit between 
President Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, such a breathing 
space is highly desirable. 
  It will also not be enough on its own, since Japan may use 
its time to determine on dangerous concessions. If, for 
example, Japan were to decide upon increased government 
management of the economy, it would damage itself. But it would 
also reinforce the general appeal of the concept of "managed 
trade," which is what Mr. Sutherland rightly labelled a 
"misguided and dangerous approach from all points of view." 
  What is needed is not just a deep breath, but deep thought, 
on both sides. Why, for example, should the Bank of Japan stand 
idly by while the yen soars? It should be selling the yen, 
instead, which would restrain the external value of the currency 
and, more important, expand the money supply. 
  Meanwhile, the United States needs to put forward a far 
better economic justification for its complaints about Japan's 
bilateral and overall trade surpluses than it has managed 
hitherto. It also needs to ask itself why its bilateral 
approach has been so roundly condemned. The concern is that a 
kind of Iynch law will undermine the credibility of the 
international rule of law. 
  At present the United States is determined to act as 
prosecutor, jury, judge and executioner. What is needed 
instead, is an objective assessment of Japan's alleged failures, 
along with neutral arbitration of the disputes. Even where U.S. 
complaints do not fall under the current GATT, the latter could 
still be asked to provide both an objective assessment and 
arbitration. Such an approach would be far better than 
accepting the wish of the European Union to turn the debate from 
a bilateral into merely a trilateral one. 
  The United States must be helped off the hook on which it 
has 
impaled itself. If the bilateral approach is continued, both 
its international relations and the multilateral system itself 
will be gravely damaged. The sensible alternative is to use the 
good offices of the central institution of the system, instead. 
That is the choice Mr. Clinton should now make.

<F P=106> [Report by John Mason and Lisa Wood: "Lords Back EU on </F>
Workers' Rights"] 
  [Text] The government's drive to create a flexible labour 
market suffered a substantial setback yesterday when the House 
of Lords ruled that UK laws on part-time workers' rights over 
redundancy pay and unfair dismissal are in breach of European 
law. 
  The Law Lords' ruling may add significant costs for 
employers 
as the government will be forced to give part-timers rights 
equal with those in full-time employment. 
  The reaction of employers organisations to the Lords 
judgment 
was mixed. The Confederation of British Industry said it 
believed most employers would be "relaxed about the 
implications," while the Institute of Directors condemned the 
likely changes as "contrary to the interests of employers and 
employees alike." 
  The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, many of 
whose members are from small companies, said it was 
"disappointed" this had occurred at a time when the UK was 
trying to build a flexible labour market. 
  The government suffered an equally severe blow when the Law 
Lords ruled at the same time that those bringing challenges over 
the government's implementation of European Union [EU] law 
should be able to use the High Court's judicial review procedure 
rather than go to the European Court. 
  It is expected that that might significantly increase the 
number of politically controversial cases brought by pressure 
groups. 
  The Law Lords ruled, by a majority of four to one, against 
the provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1978, which 
restricts the rights of those working less than 16 hours a week. 
  Under the Act, part-time workers are covered by unfair 
dismissal and redundancy pay provisions only after completing 
five years continuous employment. Full-time employees qualify 
for such entitlements after two years. 
  The Equal Opportunities Commission [EOC], which brought the 
action against the government, had claimed this breached 
European law intended to outlaw discrimination in the workplace. 
  The government had maintained that the provisions struck a 
fair balance between employers and employees. It also argued 
that employees working fewer than 16 hours a week benefited 
since the lack of entitlements encouraged employers to take on 
more part-time staff. 
  However, Lord Keith of Kinkel said the government had failed 
to prove that the use of the 16-hour threshold had resulted in 
an increase in part-time employment. He also noted that the 
Republic of Ireland was the only other EU country to have 
similar thresholds. 
  The Lords ruled that the Act's provisions over redundancy 
pay 
breached Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, while those over 
unfair dismissal breached the Equal Pay Directive. 
  The government must now introduce legislation to conform UK 
law with that of the EU. The Department of Employment said that 
would happen as soon as possible. However, it seems unlikely 
that it will be passed without ministers having to endure strong 
protests from right-wing and anti-European Tory MPs. 
  Part-time work is the growth area in the UK labour market, 
involving about a fifth of the 25 million workforce. 
  Its advantages for employers include increased flexibility 
and cost saving -- any employee who works less than 15 hours per 
week, or earns less than 56 pounds, does not have to be covered 
for National Insurance. 
  The EOC estimates the move will affect about 500,000 
part-time staff now working between eight and 16 hours a week. 
They will not formally enjoy the same rights as full-time staff 
until legislation reaches the statute book. Until then they 
will be able cite the Law Lords' judgment in industrial 
tribunals.

  [Excerpt] Hannover -- The strike in the west German metal 
industry has been averted two days before its scheduled start. 
After 14 hours of negotiations and consultations, on Saturday [5 
March] morning, the IG Metall trade union and the Gesamtmetall 
employers association agreed on terminating the conflict. 
  The compromise provides for keeping the existing holiday pay 
and leave arrangements. At the same time a job securing model, 
similar to that at Volkswagen, will be introduced. In addition, 
the 3.6 million metalworkers will get a 2 percent higher pay for 
seven months, as of 1 June. 
  IG Metall's head, Klaus Zwickel, called the compromise an 
"agreement achieved virtually at the last minute." Without the 
1.5 million workers out on warning strikes and the high turnout 
of 92.2 percent in the ballot vote, this result could not have 
been achieved. The agreement is to serve as a model that all 
districts are recommended to adopt. 
  Gesamtmetall's president, Hans-Joachim Gottschol, said that 
this compromise involves "no additional costs" for compaines in 
the metal and electrical industries. Holiday pay and extra 
payments will be calculated on the basis of May 1994. This will 
ease costs in 1995 and 1996. In addition, there will be a 
one-time 10-percent cut in extra payments this year. 
  The model, which will be valid for two years, shall enable 
companies to cut the work week from the current 36 hours to down 
to 30 hours if incoming order levels are low. In certain cases, 
this will be linked with securing jobs, Zwickel said. [passage

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- On Monday [7 March] morning, once 
again warning strikes of the public sector began in parts of 
Lower Saxony. According to the Public Service, Transportation, 
and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV), these strikes will have a 
considerable negative effect on public local traffic in 
Braunschweig, Goettingen, and Lueneburg in the course of the 
morning. After the agreement reached in the west German metal 
industry, the Trade Union has stuck to the warning strikes in 
Lower Saxony to make the public sector employers present a new 
offer for he next round of negotiations on 10 March. 
  So far, the OeTV demand for income improvements of 4 percent 
has been countered by the employers with a list of items to be 
abolished and the demand for a break in wage increases. Heinz 
Schleusser, the chief negotiator of the laender, has meanwhile 
come out in favor of a 2-percent wage raise as of 1 January 
1995. Regarding the issue of safeguarding employment, however, 
the Social Democratic Party of Germany politician did not show 
any readiness for compromise in an interview with the Berlin 
daily B.Z. (Monday edition). 
  The OeTV expects about 5,000 participants in warning strikes 
in Braunschweig, Goettingen, Lueneburg as well a in Holzminden, 
Celle, and Salzgitter on Monday. Last Tuesday, about 10,000 
public sector employees had gone on temporary strike in Lower 
Saxony.

  [Text] Biblis (DPA) -- During the preparations for 
restarting the Biblis A nuclear reactor in southern Hesse, one 
of the main cooling pumps in the radioactive area caught fire 
Friday [4 March] evening. As the Hesse Environment Ministry 
announced in the evening, there was no danger to the population, 
as far as investigations can tell so far. According to the 
operating company, RWE Energie AG (Essen), the fire was 
extinguished quickly. 
  However, the Ministry has ordered all preparations for 
restarting the Biblis A reactor to stop immediately, Spokeswoman 
Renate Gunzenhauser said. The nuclear reactor had been closed 
down for about three months because of maintenance work and was 
supposed to be put into service again on Monday upon the order 
of FRG Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic 
Union). Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens) 
wanted to have the reactor closed down for the time being for 
safety reasons. 
  Gunzenhauser said that the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory 
Authority was informed about the accident by RWE Energie AG 
early this evening. RWE reported that the fire alarm was 
sounded around 1700. The internal sprinkler facility started 
working around 1710, the fire was extinguished at approximately 
1724. Employees of the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Authority are 
gathering information about the accident on site. The FRG 
Environment Ministry has been told about the accident by the 
Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Authority, Gunzenhauser stated.

  [Text] Biblis -- According to the management of the Biblis 
nuclear power plant in Hesse (Bergstrasse district), an 
approximately 12-cm-long steel chisel caused the fire at the 
plant on Friday [4 March]. During the assembly of the motor of 
one of the main cooling pumps, which was taken apart for 
examination purposes, the instrument was probably left between 
the casing and the winding, the director of the power plant, 
Klaus Distler, announced today. "We believe that the matter has 
now been settled," he stated. Preparations for a startup of the 
plant, which has been idle for about three months, will 
continue. Currently, a spare motor is being prepared for 
installation. 
  For the assembly, however, the approval of the Environment 
Ministry in Hesse is required. Hesse's Environment Minister 
Joschka Fischer (Greens) viewed the fire as confirmation of his 
concerns regarding the safety of the nuclear power plant, which 
was built 20 years ago. He asked Environment Minister Toepfer 
to withdraw his approval for the renewed operation of the 
reactor. Toepfer's ministry announced that it wants to wait for 
the report by the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Board.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of Bundeswehr Inspector 
General Klaus Naumann, NATO will need to institute a new command 
and control structure in order to carry out peacemaking 
interventions in international conflicts. In an interview with 
Berlin "Deutschlandradio," Naumann said on Friday [4 March] that 
the alliance must also ask itself the fundamental question of 
whether it should assume a mandate in which it simply carries 
out orders on behalf of the United Nations or the CSCE, without 
being permitted to make its own decisions; or whether NATO 
should make decisions on a United Nations or CSCE mandate. 
  The question is also whether NATO will say of its own 
volition: Here is a security problem that we want to solve in 
the sphere of our interests in consensus between the 16 nations, 
and this is where we will prepare for the necessary action. 
Naumann emphasized that this issue requires a political answer. 
The inspector general reiterated his view that, in future, 
German units should also participate in such NATO operations.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After contradictory reports on the 
alleged involvement of German companies in the construction of a 
poison gas factory in Libya, doubts have been voiced about the 
Federal Government's information policy. On Deutschlandfunk 
radio, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] security expert 
Norbert Gansel said on Friday [4 March] that the Federal 
Government held back information on German assistance for the 
construction of a new poison gas plant in the city of Tarhuna, 
some 60 km outside Tripoli. Gansel described the government's 
information as contradictory and as playing down the matter. 
  Bernd Schmidbauer, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], 
the responsible official in the Chancellor's Office for the 
coordination of the intelligence services, said last night on 
ZDF's [Second German Television Channel] "Heute Journal" 
program, that since the summer of 1992, the Federal Government 
has "not just had vague indications, but very specific 
indications" that a subterranean facility was being built in a 
dry valley in Tarhuna. Various German companies had been warned 
beforehand. The parliamentary state secretary in the Economics 
Ministry, Reinhard Goehner (CDU), during question hour in 
Parliament, initially only spoke of "vague indications" that the 
government has had for about 1.5 years. 
  Schmidbauer, however, said that the plant was discovered and 
"uncovered" in the summer of 1992. All "necessary steps" were 
initiated in international cooperation to warn all "relevant 
companies," the state minister stressed. There is "not a single 
clue pointing to a German company that is furnishing this 
facility," but information shows that the material that was used 
for the construction of the tunnel is machinery that is 
available anywhere in the world and "could also come from 
Germany." Schmidbauer said that, for the first time, it was 
then possible to identify the project before its completion. 
  On Friday, Schmidbauer rejected Gansel's accusations that 
the 
Federal Government did not tell Parliament the whole truth about 
the "Tarhuna project." Herbert Schaefer, the author of the 
report broadcast by ZDF, told DPA that Schmidbauer did "not tell 
the truth" as far as the time at which the government found out 
about the construction of the tunnel. The Federal Government 
has known about the tunnel project and the probable involvement 
of German companies since January 1989. 
  In February 1991, even more concrete indications about the 
tunnel project became available. The Federal Export Office at 
Eschborn near Frankfurt was "muzzled" by Bonn in 1991. 
Officials there were not permitted to repeat in front of the 
camera what they had said before, the author stated. On Friday, 
the Federal Office said that the export to Libya of tunnel 
drilling machines, tools, and equipment needed for the 
construction of a tunnel have been banned since 7 April 1993. 
  A German company made headlines in the past in connection 
with the construction of a poison gas plant in Libya. The 
Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr designed and constructed a 
poison-gas plant worth 255 million German marks in the Libyan 
city of Al-Rabitah. Under an identical name -- "Pharma 150" -- a 
multipurpose chemical plant was built in Hong Kong, which served 
as a camouflage address for the plans and goods that were in 
reality shipped to Libya. The Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH, 
which belongs to the then government-owned Salzgitter group, had 
taken over the planning of all details and all engineering work 
for the buildings of the project.

  [Text] Bonn/Paris (DPA) -- Germany, France, and Poland 
intend to cooperate more closely at the military level. This 
was agreed by the defense ministers of the three countries, 
Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Francois 
Leotard, and Piotr Kolodziejczyk, respectively, in a joint 
meeting in Paris on Thursday night [3 March]. 
  On Friday, the Defense Ministry in Bonn stated that this was 
the first time in history that the defense ministers of these 
three countries had met for trilateral talks. The three sides 
agreed, among other things, that German, French, and Polish 
units should carry out joint exercises. The first land and sea 
forces exercises have already been planned for this year. No 
details have been made public yet. 
  Paper exercises, that is to say exercises without the 
participation of military units, should also be planned and 
held. In addition, the ministers decided to consult Eurocorps 
partners on the possibility of inviting a Polish unit for 
exercises held by the German-French Brigade. Experts should 
hold joint meetings designed to improve knowledge of individual 
defense principles. 
  The ministers expressed their determination to further 
promote cooperation through annual meetings. The objective is 
that "cooperation serves security and the shaping of a unified 
Europe." France and Germany support the desire of Poland and 
other Central and East European countries to become an integral 
element of the European Union and to cooperate more closely with 
the member states of the Western European Union [WEU] and NATO. 
  The ministers described the development of a cooperation 
program in the Atlantic alliance with the view to a Partnership 
for Peace as an important step toward this goal. At the same 
time, they welcomed the fact that NATO is open for membership to 
other European countries capable of promoting the principles of 
the Washington Treaty and of contributing to the security of the 
North Atlantic territory. 
  As far as the assessment of the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia is concerned, the three partners concurred that the 
determination of the community of peoples and NATO's 
demonstrated commitment on behalf of the United Nations to help 
the people in Sarajevo, whose very existence is threatened, and 
enforce a cease-fire. [sentence as received] The three 
ministers expressly recognized "Russia's positive role."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 March], FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel received Somsavat Lengsavat, foreign 
minister of the People's Republic of Laos, for an exchange of 
views on the economic relations between the two states. This is 
the first visit by a foreign minister since the assumption of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1958. 
  Kinkel paid tribute to the economic opening up of the small 
Southeast Asian people's republic and promised the continuation 
of German development aid, as it also corresponds to the new 
Asia concept of German foreign policy. However, framework 
conditions for investments must be established by Laos itself. 
With an annual per-capita income of $210, Laos is one of the 
poorest countries in Asia. Since 1990, Germany has provided 
about 80 million German marks in development aid, particularly 
in the health sector.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 March], the Bundestag 
discussed the horrible human rights violations in the "forgotten 
war" between northern and southern Sudan and condemned them 
unanimously. In a discussion, which was agreed on by all 
parliamentary groups, it was made clear that at least 1.5 
million people have been killed since 1983 in the war between 
the Islamic government in Khartoum and the south, which is 
primarily inhabited by Christians and followers of other 
religions. 
  In a statement for the Bundestag debate, the Society for 
Endangered Peoples in Goettingen cited the figure of 150,000 
Nubians who have been kidnapped; many of them have been 
virtually enslaved. The Society calls for UN protection zones. 
The United Nations has warned against an acute famine. Helmut 
Schaefer, state minister in the Foreign Ministry, called for a 
lasting peace and not just a cease-fire. Possibilities for 
pacification are to be searched for together with the European 
partners. 
  The constant hindrances of humanitarian aid are 
"unbearable," 
Christian Democratic Union Deputy Alois Count of Waldburg-Zeil 
noted. Speaking on behalf of Alliance 90/Greens, Konrad Weiss 
recalled the constant bombing attacks by the Sudanese Air Force 
on refugee camps, which are continuing even now.

  [Text] Munich/London (DPA) -- The European Airbus 
partners, together with U.S. aircraft builder Boeing, will delay 
their studies for a superjumbo with more than 500 seats until 
mid-1995, for the time being. Then a decision is to be made 
whether or not the development of the new VLCT plane (Very Large 
Commercial Transport) will be continued together. This was 
decided by the European Airbus companies Aerospatiale (France), 
British Aerospace (Great Britain), Casa (Spain), and Deutsche 
Aerospace (Dasa/Germany) as well as the U.S. Boeing corporation 
(Seattle) at a meeting in London on Thursday [3 March], Dasa 
announced. 
  At the meeting, it was agreed that, in the future, the 
umbrella organization of the Airbus partners, Airbus Industrie 
(Toulouse), will itself be involved in the studies. In the 
studies for a plane that is larger than the Jumbo Jet currently 
produced by Boeing, which were initiated in 1993, only the 
Airbus shareholders have talked to each other so far, since 
Airbus Industrie and Boeing are direct competitors. 
Speculations about the departure of Aerospatiale from the 
project were denied by a Dasa spokesman. According to the 
agreement, it is also to be examined whether other companies, 
for instance from Japan or Russia, may be included in the 
project.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Pasqua's Secret Law"] </F>
  [Text] Pasqua is getting ready to throw a big stone in the 
majority's waters. At the Ministry of Interior he is discreetly 
preparing a bill aimed at organizing primaries for the 
presidential election. In light of the difficulties the Union 
for French Democracy (UDF) and the Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
are experiencing to reach an agreement for a single list for the 
European Parliament election, he is more than ever convinced of 
the primaries' usefulness. More than five years after launching 
the idea of deciding between the different presidential 
candidates in his camp, this time Pasqua decided to resort to 
extraordinary measures to achieve it. Since he heads the 
Ministry of Interior and commands its resources, Pasqua is 
henceforth sure of attaining his objective. "When I have an 
idea, I don't give up, and this one above all," he notes. Pasqua 
wants to be the man that allowed the Right to win the 1995 
presidential elections. The only key to success is sending a 
sole candidate to the first round. He remembers the 1988 failure 
only too well. He also knows that in one year, the majority 
candidates may be even more numerous than in 1988. Moreover, it 
is the best way to pronounce himself officially neither for 
Jacques Chirac nor for Edouard Balladur, but for the winner. 
Supported by the prime minister, Pasqua has entrusted many 
Ministry directors with the task of preparing the bill for the 
primaries. The directorate of political affairs, the electoral 
bureau and his adviser, William Abitbol, have almost refused to 
have anything to do with it, but the project will stay on the 
back burner until the cantonal elections so as not to sow 
discord within the majority at election time, given that the UDF 
and Giscard now reject this procedure, for which they 
nonetheless opted in 1990. The former president of the Republic 
believes it no longer conforms to the spirit of the 
constitution. As for Chirac, after having insistently demanded 
it for many years, he has been strangely silent on the issue 
since Balladur has been prime minister and enjoys a high poll 
rating. For his part, Raymond Barre remains firm in his 
position. He still terms this project a "veritable 
cretin-deceiver." The minister of interior and his advisers 
believe in the success of their plan and ironically note that 
"of course, the UDF may not take it too well." Pasqua is taking 
every possible precaution. He has asked numerous legal experts 
to use their knowledge to avoid constitutional problems. The 
charter that the UDF and the RPR jointly prepared in 1991 
envisioned that only militants would vote in the primaries. 
Next, a grand electorate college was envisioned in case of early 
presidential elections similar to those in which de Gaulle was 
elected in 1958. However, in the Pasqua project, all voters, 
either from the Right or from the Left, would be invited to cast 
a ballot, even if Balladur still favors a grand electoral 
college. Question: wouldn't leftist voters choose the worse 
rightist candidate? "This is an argument for intellectuals," the 
Ministry of Interior explains. So that the constitutional 
council is not affected, the 1991 charter on the primaries was 
not adhered to on another point. It would make this pre-first 
round "compulsory" for their two political parties. In the bill 
concocted at the Ministry of Interior, the system of primaries 
could be applied to all parties wishing to use it. This is an 
fundamental difference, because compulsion would need a 
constitutional reform. The project thus envisions that, on one 
or many Sundays, all mayoralties, including socialist and 
communist ones, open their doors to voters to choose their 
candidate for the presidential election. As in any other 
election, municipalies would be responsible for organizing the 
election. The Ministry's competent services have calculated that 
the project would cost 70 million francs. Who will pay? Two 
hypotheses were quickly discarded: the first would have the 
state, and hence taxpayers, bear the burden; the second would 
levy a tax on the municipalities. So, political parties would 
pay. The more there would be, the lower the bill for everyone! 
However, municipalities would still advance the sums needed for 
organizing. They would then be reimbursed by the state, which 
would reimburse itself by not contributing to political parties 
the monies owed within the context of the law on financing 
political parties. The project has its limitations: it cannot 
prohibit unlucky candidates from running in the presidential 
elections. The project would immediately be rejected by the 
Constitutional Council. It would thus be a matter of a 
"gentleman's agreement," explains an Interior Ministry 
official. Only a leading candidate would present himself in the 
first round. One issue is still pending: should the leading 
candidate have an absolute or a relative majority? Electoral 
experts and jurists have not yet decided. However, they should 
do so soon, to allow the project to be submitted to Parliament 
as early as the spring session, making it possible to organize 
the primaries in January 1995. Before that, the project "aimed 
at organizing the primaries" should be submitted to the State 
Council, then to the Council of Ministers. At the Ministry, 
everyone is expecting a general outcry. According to Abitbol, 
"we certainly shall have no legal difficulties, but we ought to 
expect political reservations." First of all, from the PS 
[Socialist Part], which is "tired of voting for texts that suit 
the affairs of the UDF and the RPR," and knows that if the 
project came to fruition, the party would surely lose the 
presidential elections. Guy Carcassonne, a constitutional expert 
and a Rocard adviser, admits that while the project is not 
anticonstitutional, it is revolting and "crazy." Secondly, from 
the UDF: while constitutional expert Didier Maus sees no legal 
problems in the project as conceived, he does not favor it. UDF 
officials prefer to think that this law will never see the light 
of day. Giscard followers note they would not vote for such a 
project. 
  However, numerous Republican Party and Social Democratic 
Center party officials believe that this is the only way to 
avoid a new Giscard-Chirac confrontation and relinquish the 
place to Balladur. While Pasqua's entourage is working on the 
text to make it impeccable, it states its readiness to discuss 
it with the UDF, on condition that it be only on a problem of 
commas!

Logistical Than Military', Andreatta Says"] 
  [Text] Koper, 5 Mar (ANSA) -- Britain's proposal to involve 
Italy and Turkey in the strengthening of UN peacekeeping forces 
in Bosnia "is aimed more at the logistical than military field," 
Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta said at a brief 
conference with Slovenian Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle. 
  Andreatta stressed that "there has been no official request 
from the United Nations for Italian participation in Bosnia" but 
he confirmed that talks on the subject are going ahead at the 
United Nations in the wake of promptings from Britain. 
  Answering a question on possible Serbian reaction to an 
Italian presence, Andreatta said that "the opposition of the 
Serbs referred to Turkey, not to Italy." "The problem is rather 
whether troops should be used under the auspices of NATO or that 
of the United Nations, since one choice or the other requires a 
different type of commitment." 
  Andreatta was speaking after a brief visit to the large 
Italian community in Koper, the capital of Slovenian Istria, 
during which he inaugurated a historic palazzo restored with 
Italian funds. 
  Noting in his speech that ethnic minorities help sharpen 
"critical acumen and a relish for contradiction," Andreatta 
expressed the view that "our generation is only passing through, 
but it has the job of reducing borders to an archaeological 
status." 
  Andreatta's visit was keenly awaited by the Italian minority 
in Istria -- also in the Croatian part, which he will visit this 
evening (Verteneglio) -- who are hoping for a new constitutional 
settlement from Croatia and Slovenia in the wake of Yugoslavia's 
break-up.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: Controversy Over the Idea of </F>
Sending In Italians"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 6 Mar (ANSA) -- During discussion of what 
fresh United Nations peacekeeping forces might be sent to Bosnia 
to relieve troops already there, one working hypothesis is to 
send in Italian and Turkish troops, according to NATO sources 
here today. 
  Up until now, the UN has always ruled out troops from 
nations 
bordering on the former Yugoslavia and the Balkan states taking 
part in the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR). However, UNPROFOR 
commander, General Michael Rose, this past week asked for new 
reinforcements (at least 10,500 men) to help enforce the truce 
at Sarajevo and to strengthen the protection of the security 
zone. 
  The United Kingdom, which along with France, has provided 
most of the some 12,000 UN troops currently in Bosnia, 
reportedly stands ready to send in another 1,200 soldiers, but 
on condition that other European states respond to General 
Rose's call, these same NATO sources said. London has 
reportedly proposed that bordering states like Italy and Turkey 
send troops to relieve UN troops at other hot spots around the 
world so they, in turn, can be sent to the Balkans. In this way, 
some 5,500 UN troops could be freed to go to Bosnia, according 
to British estimates. 
  Meanwhile, in Rome, Italian Defense Undersecretary Antonio 
Patuelli, intervened in the debate Sunday by underscoring the 
"strong validity" of the UN's determination to keep troops of 
neighboring countries out the former Yugoslav territory. He 
said he was certain that the United Nations should and would 
continue to adhere to this line. 
  Italy is already doing its part by furnishing the air bases 
for the UN initiatives and by taking part in the naval blockade 
in the lower Adriatic, Patuelli said. 
  In Italy, as general elections move closer, the matter has 
become a campaign issue. 
  General Luigi Caligaris, running for a seat in the Chamber 
of 
Deputies on the Forza Italia ticket, told a campaign rally in 
Trieste today that he was sharply against the sending of Italian 
soldiers to Bosnia as part of the UN force there, for both 
practical and political reasons. Should a UN decision call for 
Italian troops to be sent to Bosnia, it would be Italy's duty to 
comply, according to Mario Segni, the Pact for Italy champion. 
  The leader of Democratic Alliance, Ferdinando Adornato 
concurred, saying that the indifference to Bosnia so far shown 
by the European states was a disgrace. However, the matter of 
sending in Italian troops should be carefully weighed by both 
Italy and the United Nations, he said, because of the difficult 
history of relations between Italy and the Balkan states. 
  It is certainly an issue to be considered with great care, 
agreed Environment Minister Valdo Spini during a campaign rally 
for the Socialist Party in Ancona. 
  These thoughts were echoed by People's Party deputy Carlo 
Fracanzani, chairman of the House Commission for Community 
Policies. He noted the risk of producing "contradictory results" 
for historical-political-geographical reasons. 
  However, any such initiative should be considered only under 
at least four conditions, Francanzani said: 1) that the UN 
overrides its general principle not to send in protection forces 
from states neighboring on the trouble spots; 2) that all sides 
to the conflict give their explicit assent; 3) that the Italian 
contingent be given an exclusively logistical role; and 4) that 
any such decision not be taken by the government alone but be 
endorsed by the new parliament as well. 
  "If the United Nations asks us it will be useful and 
opportune to deploy Italian Blue Helmets to Bosnia," said 
Roberto Formigoni, the coordinator for the People's Party in 
Lombardy today. 
  The president of the Venezia Giulia and Dalmazia 
Association, 
Lucio Toth, Sunday said that as exiles those in his organization 
knew from direct experience the high level of conflict that 
exists among Croats, Serbs and Muslims and for this reason are 
very concerned about any intervention of Italian troops in 
Bosnia, even though "we call for a more active political role 
for Italy in finding a solution to the crisis." 
  He pointed out that tens of thousands of Italians live along 
the Istrian-Dalmation coast and could well fall hostage to 
various warring forces in the field.

Embargo"] 
  [Text] Trieste, 5 Mar (ANSA) -- "I confirm that we tried to 
reduce the state of potential tension in the area, but for Italy 
and all the other members of the European Union [EU], Greece's 
action appeared to go beyond the necessary patience one needs in 
relations between neighbours," said Italian Foreign Minister 
Beniamino Andreatta today, answering a question on the Greek 
partial embargo on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] after the Central European Initiative meeting 
here. 
  Andreatta again highlighted that the Greek decision -- in 
retaliation against Macedonia's declaration of independence 
under a name Greece says signals territorial ambitions on the 
northern Greek province of the same name -- was "a violation of 
precise European Union regulations." 
  All EU members except Greece have recognised the former 
Yugoslav republic as Macedonia. 
  He also stressed that "certain countries, including 
Macedonia" have suffered unduly from the embargo, and that it 
was necessary to "step in with some form of compensation." For 
this reason, Andreatta said, studies had begun on a road project 
linking Valona, Sofia and Istanbul. 
  Andreatta ended his reply to the Greece-Macedonia question 
by 
saying that "if Greece has put itself in an awkward position," 
it "cannot count on implicit European solidarity; our position 
is clear on that."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "European Union: Expansion </F>
Strengthens Mark-Linked North, Costa Claims"] 
  [Text] Rome, 3 Mar (ANSA) -- The future expansion of the 
European Union [EU] to include Sweden, Finland and Austria is a 
"positive factor" but will increase the strength of those 
countries whose currencies are linked to the German mark, 
according to Italian Transport Minister Raffaele Costa. 
  "The area of influence under the mark has grown in a short 
time from sixty to one hundred million people, indirect 
influence is being tripled, and that's not the end of it because 
other countries in the area of the mark are knocking at the 
Union's door," Costa said Thursday [3 March], commenting the 
agreements reached Monday with the three northern states, which 
may join the EU in January 1995. 
  The prospects for Italy at the turn of the century will not 
be very bright, especially if Italy is unable "to gain 
considerable political and economic room in Europe and in the 
Mediterranean," Costa added. 
  "Europe itself, which inappropriately criticized us for our 
state-run overspending, never misses a chance to fatten itself 
with Franco-Prussian bureaucrats and to approve antifree market 
measures such as those on milk quotas," Costa claimed, referring 
to EU demands for reductions in milk production. 
  Italy, Costa asserted, must be able to negotiate and "fight" 
in a Europe which he described as "sometimes contradictory -- 
but always serious and careful with detail -- and conditioned, 
tomorrow more than today, by the Bundesbank."

<F P=106> [Ugo Stille Commentary: "Clinton Gets Tough on Economy"] </F>
  [Text] New York -- "For too long we have allowed the 
economy to be the poor relation of foreign policy. The time has 
come to change." This was one of the first statements made by 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher after Clinton came to the 
White House. His remarks reflected the thinking of the 
President, who was convinced that since the end of the Cold War 
economic rivalry has taken the place of the ideological kind in 
relations between nations. 
  Indeed, in his international strategy Clinton has been as 
vague and contradictory on geopolitical problems as he has been 
steadfast and resolute on economic matters. Thus, while 
American foreign policy still lacks a guiding principle and a 
coherent sense of direction., U.S. international economic policy 
is regulated by a very precise premise: The world, Clinton 
says, has now entered the era of "the globalization of the 
economy" and America must adapt its conduct to this fact. 
  Trade policy thus becomes an essential component of foreign 
policy and represents the point of contact between domestic 
economic development and expansion in the foreign markets. 
These two issues, the President stresses, cannot be separated 
but must be viewed from the same angle. The latest examples of 
this change of course in America's trade strategy came with 
Clinton's personal intervention to guarantee the U.S. 
aeronautics industry a giant $6 billion order from Saudi Arabia 
and his breaking off of the negotiations with Japan following 
the threat of economic reprisals. 
  Although these issues are different in nature, they have in 
common the "aggressiveness" of the White House, which contrasts 
with the passive line pursued by previous Washington 
governments. The stakes were high with Saudi Arabia -- a $6 
billion order to renew the entire Saudi commercial fleet (50 
aircraft). The choice was between the offers submitted by two 
giants of the American aeronautical industry, McDonnell and 
Boeing, and the European Airbus consortium. 
  Clinton intervened personally with King Fahd to ensure that 
the order went to the American firms, pointing out to the Saudi 
monarch that it was only Washington's intervention that saved 
his country from Iraq's aggression. The outcome is that this 
giant order will save the jobs of tens of thousands of people 
and will have positive repercussions on many activities 
connected with the aeronautics industry. 
  To those who accuse him of having violated the principles of 
free trade, Clinton has been able to reply that he blocked a 
similar move by French President Francois Mitterrand in favor of 
the Airbus and that in any case the time had come for the United 
States to defend its industries by adopting the practices of 
intervention that its competitors have been using for some time. 
  The issue of the trade negotiations with Japan is more 
complex. The negotiations to reduce the growing American trade 
deficit with Japan have been proceeding inconclusively for some 
20 years, with agreements in principle not followed by concrete 
implementation. Meanwhile, the annual trade deficit with Tokyo 
has reached the unprecedented figure of $60 billion. 
  At his recent meeting in Washington with new Japanese 
Premier 
Hosokawa, Clinton changed tactic. Instead of being satisfied 
with vague and ambiguous agreements, like his predecessors, he 
preferred to break off the negotiations. No agreement, he said, 
is better than a merely artificial and cosmetic agreement. 
  The clash occurred over America's demand to set numerical 
levels for market shares for American products in the various 
sectors of the Japanese economy, which Hosokawa rejected. 
Unless he makes some concessions within the next month, Clinton 
reserves the right to adopt reprisals through the imposition of 
duties and other measures against Japanese products. 
  Where will this trial of strength lead? There is obviously a 
chance that it will give rise to an outright trade war, but few 
people believe in such a development, which would be damaging to 
both countries and would disrupt the entire world economic 
outlook. The expectation, therefore, is that a compromise will 
be reached whereby Japan will allow its market to be opened up 
more to American industries, while, however, avoiding the rigid 
"numerical quantification" sought by Washington. 
  Clinton's aggressive strategy is criticized in America by 
those who perceive in it the abandonment of the principles of 
free trade and a return to protectionism, albeit in disguised 
forms. The White House's reply is that to raise the issue in 
such terms means to fail to understand the fact that the debate 
now is not between the proponents of free trade and the 
protectionists, but between the theory of absolute free trade 
and that of the so-called cautious activism propounded by the 
head of the President's economic advisers, Laura Tyson, which 
envisages the possibility of limited interventions designed to 
support home industries abroad. The difference, Washington 
stresses, lies in the fact that, whereas protectionism entails 
the closure of the American market to foreign competition, thus 
reflecting the concept of a "closed economy," "cautious 
activism," on the contrary, aims to open up foreign markets to 
American products, thus reflecting the current expansive 
dynamism of the U.S. economy. 
  This must be the starting point for understanding the 
significance of the commercial turnabout. A year ago, in the 
midst of the election campaign, Clinton lamented the "economic 
and technological" decline of the United States with respect to 
Europe and Japan. Now he himself admits that the situation has 
been completely reversed. It is not just that the increasingly 
solid pace of the American recovery contrasts with the 
continuing recession in Europe and Japan, but also the 
increasing U.S. successes in the technological field. The 
structural renewal of the automobile industry has enabled 
Detroit's big three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) to make 
exceptional increases in their profits, while the automobile 
industries in both Japan and Europe -- once feared rivals -- are 
now in a deep crisis. Furthermore, the United States has 
regained its primacy in the semiconductors field, and all its 
electronics and computer technology sectors are advancing more 
rapidly than any of their competitors. 
  Clinton does not conceal the fact that his aim is to 
increase 
America's international competitiveness, especially in the high 
technology sector, through cooperation between government and 
private industry. This approach, which envisages a number of 
incentives for investment in technology and government 
interventions in the international field, does not, the White 
House stresses, conflict with the strengthening of free trade 
already achieved through the NAFTA and GATT accords. The common 
objective is to accelerate the creation of "open markets" 
throughout the world economy, with the advantage of creating new 
jobs in America and at the same time providing Europe and Japan 
with a useful means of emerging from the recession.

<F P=106> [Enrico Marro report: "War Over Taxation"] </F>
  [Text] Rome -- Everyone has entered the arena for the 
battle of the taxes that is enlivening the election campaign. 
On the one hand, there is [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, 
promising to have "everyone pay less," and, on the other, the 
progressive forces, Mario Segni's Pact, and Mino Martinazzoli's 
Popular Party, who accuse him of demagoguery and of wanting to 
empty the state's coffers. In Italy too, as in the United 
States and Britain, this time votes will be gained partly on the 
basis of tax promises. 
  Forza Italia has proposed a single income tax rate of 30 
percent for all. But how are we to ensure that the rich pay 
proportionately more than the poor? By means of allowances on 
taxable income, Silvio Berlusconi's experts say. "In order to 
cancel out the negative impact on lower incomes," PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] economist Vincenzo Visco said, 
"the present deductions would have to be at least doubled. This 
would entail a frightening loss of revenue. It is easy to 
conduct propaganda in connection with taxation, but it is much 
more difficult to introduce reforms." According to Pact for 
Italy leader Mario Segni, Forza Italia's proposal "is clearly 
demagogic and would not achieve the progressive nature of 
taxation envisaged by the Constitution." This is a "nonexistent 
conjecture," according to Martinazzoli. 
  The PRI [Italian Republican Party] daily, LA VOCE 
REPUBBLICANA, points out that Alan Ford's cartoon features a 
character called "Superchuk, a bizarre character who robs the 
poor to give to the rich. Is there perhaps a Robin Hood in 
reverse among the advisers of the magnate of Arcore 
[Berlusconi]?" According to the CGIL [Italian General 
Confederation of Labor], these "extravagant promises" are 
"neo-Reaganite." Yesterday evening Berlusconi replied in an 
interview on television channel four news: "The progressive 
forces are still distorting the facts. First, our proposal 
envisages exemption from taxation for all the poorest families. 
Also we want to introduce an allowance for each family member, 
so that larger families will pay less." Lowering the rate to 30 
percent, he added, will "ensure that those with higher incomes 
have less incentive to evade taxation and more incentive to 
invest." According to Forza Italia's economist, Antonio Martino, 
"poor people will no longer have to pay income tax." In an 
interview he said: "Those leveling charges against us are in 
fact defending a system in which for those with taxable incomes 
of just 14.4 million lire, there is a tax rate of 27 percent, 
close to the current U.S. maximum of 28 percent. The result is 
that poor people in Italy pay tax the same rate as applies to 
the Rockefellers in America." 
  "A single tax rate," Segni replied, "is unknown in all the 
Western industrialized countries." It is better to "merge tax 
rates, reducing them to three or four and eliminating the 
highest and lowest rates." Tax expert Giulio Tremonti pointed 
out that "everyone is proposing bits of reform but forgetting 
the overall picture." AN [National Alliance] leader Gianfranco 
Fini proposed "a few clear regulations." The battle is likely 
to continue until the elections. The new system, which has led 
to a contest to the last vote among the three major alignments, 
favors the definition of well-defined stances. On 27-28 March 
three-fourths of parliamentary seats will be allocated to 
whoever wins in each electoral constituency. With the decline 
of the ideologically inspired vote, support must be gained on 
the basis of specifics. And taxation features very prominently 
among these. 
  In its own election program Forza Italia proposes abolishing 
the current seven income tax rates (from the minimum 10 percent 
for those earning up to 7.2 million to the maximum 51 percent 
for those earning over 300 million) and replacing them with a 
single rate of 30 percent for everyone. Two days ago the 
progressive alignment, led by [PDS Secretary] Achille Occhetto, 
replied with calculations of its own, from which it emerges that 
by implementing a single 30 percent rate, people earning up to 
70 million a year would pay more tax than they do now, whereas 
those earning more would make considerable savings. That is not 
true, Forza Italia replied: The calculations fail to take 
account of the allowances that we want to introduce. 
  But apart from these calculations, the rival alignments are 
not relinquishing their traditional polemical confrontations. 
"The latest opinion polls tell us that 87 percent of Chinese 
citizens want Berlusconi as emperor of China," the Popular 
Party's Mino Martinazzoli said, in connection with Forza 
Italia's improving ratings in the opinion polls. "No specific 
arguments, and no ideas: All Martinazzoli is left with are petty 
jibes," Berlusconi's men replied.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Comit Share Offer Sells Out on </F>
Second Day"] 
  [Text] Milan, 1 Mar (ANSA) -- The public share offer for 
stock in Banca Commerciale Italiana (Comit) [Italian Commercial 
Bank] was closed Tuesday [1 March], its second day of 
privatization, with demand far superior to the offer made, bank 
sources said. 
  Bank chairman Sergio Siglienti issued a statement in which 
he 
underscored how Comit had "fulfilled expectations in response to 
the confidence shown to it by the government and IRI [Institute 
for Industrial Reconstruction]." 
  Siglienti went on to stress how the bank's ability to sell 
stock "was confirmed by the fact that shares sold directly by 
our bank amounted to some 40 percent of the entire world offer 
and at a price which, while very interesting for the investors 
as demonstrated by the success of the sale, represented for the 
seller, even with the discount, the most advantageous 
privatization operation carried out so far, even on an 
international level." 
  Satisfaction for the Comit operation was also voiced today 
by 
Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi who said "The privatization of 
Comit marks an important moment for the Italian economy. IRI, 
formed to manage the bank crisis of the 1930s, today exits from 
the banking sector. Some of the most prestigious public banks 
have now become banks of the public. With the sales on the 
market of Credit, IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Personal 
and Real Property] and Comit 700 thousand new stockholders were 
born." Ciampi then went on to recall the skepticism, only a few 
months ago, over Italy's true intention of privatization and 
how, between May and September, the government had paved the way 
to make it legally possible. 
  The path is now well defined, he concluded, and "must be 
followed with determination in the framework of an overall 
economic policy aimed at reinforcing the efficiency and 
competitiveness of the Italian productive system." 
  For his part, IRI chairman Romano Prodi recalled how 
privatization plans are in the process of being defined for the 
state's interests in the steel and foods sectors, to be followed 
by the privatization of such leading IRI interests as the Rome 
airport authority, the National highway authority and, above 
all, the communications company STET [Turin Telephone Finance 
Company]. In all cases, he concluded, the utmost transparency 
and rules of the market will be respected." 
  In his statement on the Comit success, Prodi stressed how it 
"confirmed that the right direction has been taken and that this 
opinion is amply shared by the public. The fact that hundreds 
of thousands of people have shown such confidence in our 
operation is a comfort in view of our next operations."

<F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Ames Case: Switzerland Cannot Grant </F>
Mutual Judicial Assistance"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Bern, 4 Mar (ATS) -- The Federal Police Office [OFP] 
has rejected the U.S. request for mutual judicial assistance in 
the Ames case. According to a press release from the Federal 
Office of Justice and Police [DFJP] published on Friday [4 
March], espionage is considered a political crime, which 
excludes all judicial assistance. However, three Swiss bank 
accounts held by Ames have been frozen. 
  The American request is based on the 1973 Treaty on Mutual 
Judicial Assistance in criminal matters. The request, which was 
made as part of an investigation into the spying activities of 
Aldrich Ames, a high-ranking CIA official, and his wife, Maria 
del Rosario Casa Ames, was received in Bern on 25 February. 
  Since 1985, the couple allegedly transmitted information on 
secret operations and on CIA agents to the former Soviet Union, 
and later to Russia, in exchange for over $1.5 million. Part of 
this money was deposited in Swiss bank accounts in Zurich and 
Geneva. The United States has requested that the accounts be 
frozen and that all banking documents be confiscated and turned 
over to it. 
  Switzerland cannot grant United States judicial assistance 
in 
this case, because spying, for which the Ames couple stands 
accused, constitutes a political crime, meaning it is 
exclusively directed against the state's political and social 
organization. 
  The treaty on mutual judicial assistance rules out its 
inapplicability to political crimes. The Public Ministry and 
the cantons concerned are making every effort to determine 
whether the Ameses have committed crimes within Swiss 
jurisdiction. 
  On Thursday evening, they ordered the freezing of three bank 
accounts in Zurich and Geneva.

<F P=106> [Article signed ME/PI: "Bale: Three Federal Councillors </F>
Present at Opening of Muba 94"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Excerpt] Bale, 4 Mar (ATS) -- The Muba, the most important 
public trade fair in Switzerland, opened on Friday [4 March]. 
Three federal councillors attended the opening. For 10 days 
more than 1,400 exhibitors will display their services and 
products in seven distinct sectors. The special presentations 
this year are dedicated to AIDS, civil protection, radioactive 
waste, and rational energy use. 
  Federal Councillors Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, Arnold Koller, 
and 
Swiss President Otto Stich attended the first day of Muba 1994. 
Among the people invited were Lonnart Meri, president of the 
Republic of Estonia; Mario Frick, head of the Liechtenstein 
Government; Gret Haller, president of the Swiss National 
Council; and Riccardo Jagmetti, president of the Swiss State 
Council. 
  [Public Economic Councillor] Jean-Pascal Delamuraz delivered 
a speech in which he said: "There is hope of a modest recovery, 
but we should also be aware that the economic recovery will not 
have an immediate affect on the labor market." He reminded his 
audience that the parliament will have to decide this autumn on 
whether to accept the new GATT agreements. These agreements, he 
said, are "good and even indispensable for Switzerland, but they 
will not perform miracles." They are aimed at entrepreneurs and 
"bold" workers, and are not "for the faint-hearted." 
<H5>  Fifteen Trading Partners </H5>
  This year, Muba is acting as host to 15 trading partners. 
Estonia, Kenya, the DPRK, and the region of Offenburg/Mid-Baden 
(Germany) are represented for the first time. The other guest 
countries are India, Mongolia, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, the 
Slovak Republic, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the Czech republic, 
Hungary, and the French region of Vosges. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [ATSA/SDAA report: "Falvio Cotti in Geneva: European Union </F>
and Blue Helmets on the Agenda. In His View 12 June Poll Goes 
Beyond the Specific Issue"] 
  [Text] Geneva, 3 Mar (ATS) -- The 12 June vote on the 
creation of Swiss blue helmets has an importance which goes 
"well beyond the specific issue" being put to the people. This 
is what Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti said in Geneva on 
Thursday [3 March] evening. The head of the DFAE [Federal 
Department of Foreign Affairs], who was the guest of the 
University Institute of Higher International Studies, also said 
he did not want to be classed among those who "praise" the 
European Union [EU] "at all costs." 
  The 12 June vote is very important with regard to the open 
foreign policy which Switzerland intends to pursue, the head of 
the DFAE said. His speech, entitled "The Integration of West 
Europe Is an Omnipresent Reality for Switzerland," dealt mainly 
with the Confederation's place in the community of nations. 
  Switzerland cannot ignore the influence which the Twelve 
have 
on its present and future development, Flavio Cotti pointed out. 
The development of a European structure is not achieved easily, 
he reaffirmed. The fact remains, the Federal Council member 
stressed, that the Twelve have so far managed to overcome the 
obstacles and give the Community a new dimension. The EU has 
become unavoidable and Switzerland cannot ignore it. 
  The DFAE chief also stressed the importance of Swiss 
membership of the United Nations. "Switzerland's entry into the 
United Nations as a full member will show its determination to 
participate in the building of a system of collective security 
and the pursuit of an active policy in favor of peace." 
Thinking mainly of the United Nations and the EU, Mr. Cotti 
said that "this absence at the highest level can only harm 
Switzerland's interests in the medium and long term."

<F P=106> [Report by Ulla Schmid: "Temelin: Vranitzky Counters </F>
Klaus"] 
  [Text] Vaclav Klaus was very outspoken. In a KURIER 
interview, the Czech Prime Minister sharply criticized Austria 
for lobbying against a United States loan to complete the 
Temelin nuclear power plant located near the [Czech-Austrian] 
border. "This intervention is impossible for me. It has 
something to do with the elections," Klaus suspects. The 
Austrians have other things on their minds rather than nuclear 
power plants. 
  Chancellor Vranitzky categorically rejects this suggestion: 
"There are clear reasons for our strict antinuclear policy: The 
referendum on Zwentendorf [nuclear power plant], the 
nuclear-free policy resulting from it, and the practical 
experience of half of Europe had with Chernobyl," the Chancellor 
said in an interview with KURIER. This is "ample justification" 
for opposing Temelin. He has repeatedly pointed out this 
problem, "which we do not want to hold back in spite of good 
neighborly relations." 
  Klaus' accusation that the investment offered by Austria to 
transform Temelin into a gas power plant was "state-organized 
lobbying," is countered by Vranitzky dryly: "The free-of-charge 
electricity supplies would have cost 3.5 billion Austrian 
schillings per year -- this is not lobbying." Also, it is not 
true -- as Klaus thinks -- that Austria lacks understanding for 
the Czech Republic that is building up a free market economy 
after 40 years of communism. But: "The answer to the effects of 
communism cannot be a nuclear power plant built the communist 
way." Vranitzky emphasized that the dispute over Temelin is 
"not a crusade against the Czech Republic, but our offer to 
cooperate."

  [Text] Vienna -- In view of the actions taken by the 
Turkish Government against freely elected deputies, Nationalrat 
President Heinz Fischer suggests that the Interparliamentarian 
Union (IPU) deal with the arrests of the Kurdish 
parliamentarians. 
  The arrest of the Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) 
parliamentarians has caused great concern all over the world. 
It is a violation of principles that also have to be observed 
by Turkey as a member of the Council of Europe, Fischer said. 
  The Kurdish problem in Turkey cannot be solved by arresting 
deputies and by using the military, but only by looking for 
political solutions and by means of negotiations, Fischer 
stressed and came out once again against the use of force -- no 
matter by which side -- in solving the problems of the Kurds.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A `No' to EU Membership Would Lead </F>
to Wage Losses"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- If the Austrian people said "no" to the 
European Union [EU], this would lead to a lower per-capita 
income in the medium term, Bernhard Felderer, head of the 
Institute of Higher Studies (IHS), said on the "Press Hour" 
television program yesterday. 
  The disadvantages for some groups, for instance in 
agriculture and in the foodstuffs industry, are far surpassed by 
the advantages of EU membership for the overall economy, 
Felderer said. Just the abolition of waiting times at the 
borders and of customs administration will produce annual 
savings of 8 to 20 billion schillings for the companies. 
  If one adds the abolition of certificates of origin, the end 
of the discrimination in the processing trade and the 
no-longer-necessary import turnover tax, this results in a 
massive growth of 30 to 60 billion schillings or 2 to 3 percent, 
the IHS head said. 
  These are only the advantages that can be calculated 
relatively easily; one also has to take the dynamism of the 
single market into account. However, it is difficult to put the 
specific effects into figures. 
  Felderer thinks that a common European currency will "not" 
be 
introduced "in this century." The dates set down in the 
Maastricht Treaty will be negotiated once again because of the 
difficulties of individual member countries, the IHS chief 
believes. 
<H5>  End of Anonymity </H5>
  Felderer said that the abolition of anonymous savings 
accounts and securities accounts is already "decided" -- which 
was, however, rejected by the Finance Ministry yesterday. 
Because of the "extremely attractive" final taxation within the 
framework of the tax on capital gains, one no longer needs 
anonymity; in case of the abolition of anonymity, he does not 
expect any negative effects on Austria as a financial location 
and on the savings quota.

<F P=106> [Article by Erich Hoorn: "2 Billion Schillings Invested in </F>
Russia"] 
  [Text] Moscow/Vienna -- Russia's debt to Austria amounts 
to 67 billion schillings, while debts of about 15 billion 
schillings were rescheduled within the framework of the Paris 
Club (loans secured by the state) last year. It is still 
difficult for Austrian exporters to get credit guarantees from 
the Control Bank. They are only granted in special cases. 
  According to Guenter Richter, the Austrian trade delegate in 
Moscow, Austrian firms have so far established 475 joint 
ventures in Moscow, in which they have invested about 2 billion 
schillings. However, many of these enterprises only exist on 
paper. 
  In 1993 Austria's exports to Russia decreased by 9.6 percent 
to 6.2 billion schillings. This was a good result because 
Russia's total imports decreased by 30 percent. About 1,200 
Austrian firms deal directly or indirectly with the Russian 
market. The most important export items are consumer goods, 
equipment for the food industry, and supplies for the natural 
gas and oil industries. 
  Last year, Austria's imports increased by 2.3 percent to 7.7 
billion schillings. The most important import item is energy, 
whose share decreased from 90 percent to 70 percent. However, 
supplies of semifinished and finished products increased.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandr Vladimirov, military adviser to the </F>
Russian presidency: "A Partnership for Peace or for NATO?"] 
  [Excerpts] It is quite likely that 1994 will go down in 
history as the year of the Partnership for Peace. It is equally 
likely that this initiative will promote an integrationist idea 
capable of shaping a new greater Europe which is both stable and 
democratic. But this idea could amount to no more than good 
intentions which, as we all know, pave the road to hell. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Uncertainties </H5>
  We have tried objectively not only to study the concept of 
the Partnership but also to understand the spirit it embodies. 
It is this in particular which has given rise to the first 
uncertainties and the following essential questions: 
  1. What is the initiative's objective? 
  2. What is the aim of the progressive enlargement of NATO? 
  3. What is "real partnership" and how much does it cost? 
  4. How do the NATO leaders see the borders of the 
"Euro-Atlantic region," the security of which they are saying 
must be consolidated? 
  5. What exactly are the "new security relations between the 
alliance and its partners for peace?" 
  NATO documents give no or incomplete answers to these 
questions. However, we believe that the essential thinking 
behind the Partnership for Peace and the political conditions 
which determined the birth of the concept can be summarized as 
follows: 

  -  the capability of the United Nations is 
insufficient; 
  -  NATO, while remaining the most powerful military 
organization, has lost the very reason for its existence; 
  -  Russia 
is at present so weakened that it can no longer control its 
former Warsaw Pact allies or the former Soviet republics; 
  -  the 
political leaders of Central Europe have chosen "a national 
flight from Russia to NATO;" 
  -  European diplomacy in Yugoslavia 
has reached the deadlock of a crisis at the European level which 
is burdened with spilled blood. 
<H5>  The Choice of Mechanism </H5>
  The conclusion is clear. Given the above conditions, the 
only possible remedy lies in a unification of the efforts of the 
whole of Europe with the precise aim of guaranteeing its 
security on the basis of partnership. The problem thus lies in 
the mechanism to be used in order to achieve this goal. 
  NATO has chosen the type of mechanism in proposing the 
Partnership for Peace plan, which is not bad in principle as it 
is only the Atlantic alliance which has real force and 
structures in Europe. However, this would create the danger of 
"progressively" pushing Russia out of this European process and 
of seeking European security without her. This brings us to the 
first illogical points which have served to over-simplify the 
model proposed. 
  All that NATO has seen in the Partnership for Peace is a 
mechanism for self-preservation and the creation of its new 
image. It is in this way that the idea of a Partnership for 
Peace has been transformed into that of a partnership for NATO. 
The euphoria was so great that it prevented NATO from noticing 
that the Russian bull was on the doorstep of the European china 
shop. This is the only way we can explain the later decisions 
of NATO which have harmed the idea of the Partnership for Peace. 
<H5>  The Revelation of Bosnia </H5>
  This lies in NATO's ultimatum to Serbia with the threat of 
air strikes against Serb positions in the region of Sarajevo. 
This decision, reached without taking into account Russia's 
opinion, suggests that NATO is anxious to establish its own 
importance, already inflated by an obstinate inflexibility. 
Moreover, the experts in Moscow were surprised by the rigid 
stance of France which, after having restricted itself for so 
many years to the confines of its "national trench," has 
suddenly decided to make a big show for all to see. The general 
impression is that Partnership slogans are replacing any real 
partnership, that NATO has little interest in a partnership with 
a strong and active Russia, and that the mentality of the 
Atlantic alliance is, and let us pray to God that this does not 
last, every bit as resistant to change as communist ideology. 
However, Russia's Serbian initiative proved both a cold shower 
for NATO and also something of a salvation as any bombing of 
Serbian positions would have inevitably posed the question: 
What now? 
  The fact that Russia made its position known firmly and in 
time and that this position has been accepted by NATO is, of 
course, very positive. We now have a good chance of achieving a 
peaceful solution to the Bosnian crisis. It is therefore 
important for NATO to refrain in the future from decisions 
likely to divide Europe and to discredit the ideas of the 
Partnership for Peace. 
  The above reasoning may be summarized under two key 
themes: 

  -  it is impossible to ignore the evidence that Russia 
is a major Euro-Asian power which has its own national 
interests. No one is in a position to "push it out" of either 
Europe or Asia as it covers large areas of both these 
continents; 
  -  the United Nations must see NATO not as a cure for 
all but as just one security instrument among others. 
  The UN peacemaking efforts must be based on the 
determination of the international community to make, over a 
very long period, substantial material contributions to, if not 
sacrifices for, the cause of peace. This means that politicians 
from all countries concerned must understand that sporadic and 
cheap military actions such as air strikes have no chance of 
solving peacemaking problems which require a systematic approach.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Emmanuel Duvivier] </F>
  [Text] The national Air Force could earn several billion 
francs by selling its old aircraft. Several countries, 
including Chile, could buy up to 20 Mirage-5 type aircraft from 
Belgium. The planes were modernized recently before being 
parked in a hangar as a result of the Belgian Armed Forces 
restructuring plan. Emmanuel Duvivier reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Duvivier] Last September, these Mirage-5 
fighters flew over the Bierset region [site of a major Belgian 
Air Force base] for the last time as a consequence of the cuts 
implemented by Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. Since then, the 
planes have been kept at a military field near the border with 
the Netherlands pending offers by potential buyers, and are 
beginning to rust. The Charleroi-based SABCA [Belgian 
Aeronautic Construction Company], which recently modernized the 
aircraft, has been asked to investigate the international market 
on behalf of the Belgian state. Preference will be given to 
potential buyers from democratic countries. The most likely 
candidates for now are the Philippines and above all Chile. 
  [Delcroix] Chile is a democracy. There is civilian control 
over its Armed Forces. The president was elected after a real 
democratic process. Thus, I believe that there is no problem in 
this respect. 
  [Duvivier] A Chilean Air Force delegation is expected to 
come 
to Belgium some time this month and test the aircraft. If the 
outcome of the preliminary contacts with that country is 
favorable the national defense budget could be credited with 3 
billion Belgian francs by next July. That amount would then be 
used to help modernize the Belgian Armed Forces. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Mia Doornaert commentary: "Russia and Europe"] </F>
  [Text] The fact that Russia is joining the Partnership for 
Peace offered by NATO is good news. Cooperation between the 
armed forces of NATO and Russia will contribute to reciprocal 
transparency and trust. It is not in the interest of European 
security for Russia to position itself, or be kept, outside 
Europe. 
  However, a statement by Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy 
Churkin is raising questions. Churkin saw "a great potential 
for partnership in the interest of peace" for NATO and Russia. 
  This is reminiscent of the Russian proposal for a 
partnership 
between NATO and Russia to guarantee security in Central and 
East Europe. The reaction of the Central European countries, 
which would like to join NATO, was an unequivocal "No." 
  What those countries want, and what they are striving hard 
to 
achieve, is to join forces with West Europe, not live under 
continued Russian tutelage, which produced little of positive 
value over the last 40 years. Moreover, Russia recently made 
some statements that were hardly reassuring. 
  A kind of condominium between the United States and Russia, 
a 
subtle continuation of Yalta, and of the dividing line of the 
Cold War, cannot be the aim of the Partnership for Peace . 
  The question as to whether Russia will play a constructive 
role in European security via that partnership depends not only 
on the Western understanding of Russian sensibilities, but also 
on Russia itself, and its determination of its legitimate 
interests. 
  If Russia includes continued limited sovereignty over the 
countries in Central and East Europe among its legitimate 
interests, then it will be making a mistake. And there is no 
enmity or Cold War dogma behind pointing out that it is 
inconceivable in the new Europe that state sovereignty should 
stop at the eastern border of the unified Germany. 
  Then again, the manner in which Russia effectively belongs 
to 
Europe also depends on Russia itself, on its choices regarding 
internal development, but, more importantly, on its attitude 
vis-a-vis the outside world. 
  No one has a hold on internal Russian development, not even 
the United States. However, the United States and the member 
states of the European Union can certainly influence Russian 
foreign policy. They can make it clear that constructive, 
friendly cooperation, which accepts the new situation in Europe 
and the regained sovereignty of the countries of Central and 
East Europe, will elicit a better response than the language of 
threats, and claims to "traditional spheres of influence." 
  One cannot celebrate the end of the Cold War while at the 
same time sticking to its borders. There need be no conflict 
between a constructive, active role for Russia in the area of 
European security and the legitimate demands of the countries of 
Central and East Europe. 
  If this is the spirit in which Russia joins the Partnership 
for Peace, then there will be every reason to applaud such a 
step.

<F P=106> [Anne Cadwallader report: "Committee on North an Insult to </F>
Nationalists"] 
  [Text] As speculation mounts on the imminent announcement 
of a "select committee" on the North at Westminster, the SDLP 
[Social Democratic and Labor Party] chief whip, Eddie McGrady, 
says he strongly disapproves of any such move, calling it an 
insult to nationalists. 
  The committee has for long been the desire of the UUP 
[Ulster 
Unionist Party] leader, James Molyneaux, who believes it will 
further enmesh the North into the British state. 
  Mr McGrady said it would run contrary to the inter-party 
talks process which was based on the "nothing is agreed until 
everything is agreed" principle. 
  The setting up of the committee would be "part of the 
Major/Molyneaux" deal -- a deal which Mr Molyneaux has denied 
even existed, said Mr McGrady. 
  "The committee would not contribute to solving any of the 
political, economic or social problems facing the North. It 
would simply facilitate the continuing of a sterile political 
stalemate," he said. 
  Nationalists now represent between 40 percent and 45 percent 
of the electorate and the proposal did not reflect 
proportionality or fairness, he said. 
  His party wanted the inter-party talks to recommence to 
address all the relationships which exist between the islands of 
Britain and Ireland.

<F P=106> [Daniel Bogler report: "Bae in Talks With Giat Over Joint </F>
Venture"] 
  [Text] British Aerospace [BAe] is negotiating with Giat, 
the huge, state-owned French arms manufacturer, about a link 
with Royal Ordnance, the British company's guns and ammunitions 
subsidiary. 
  A BAe spokesman said yesterday: "We have been talking to 
them 
for years about ways to enlarge the markets for products we have 
in common" -- though he added that no announcement was expected 
in the short term. 
  Given the decline in world defence markets and its own 
financial difficulties of recent years, BAe has been involved in 
a variety of collaboration attempts with rivals, though most of 
them have so far failed to succeed. 
  Last year it attempted to bring off joint ventures for its 
missiles division with France's Matra-Hachette and its regional 
jet business with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation, both of which 
collapsed. It also called off merger talks with Britain's GEC 
[General Electric Company], and in an attempt to slim its 
portfolio, BAe sold its corporate jets division and construction 
arm, Ballast Needam, in 1993 and is now selling Rover to BMW for 
800 million pounds. 
  A joint venture could strengthen Royal Ordnance, which is 
still believed to be losing money despite rationalisation. BAe 
bought the company from the government seven years ago to expand 
its core defence division. Royal Ordnance makes small arms, 
ammunition and guns for tanks such as Vickers' Challenger 2. 
  Jack Dromey, National Secretary of the Transport and General 
Workers Union told last night's BBC Money Programme: "Within 
Royal Ordnance, in presentations to the trade unions, the 
company has made it clear that it is talking to European 
companies -- Giat in particular--on a link-up and also on the 
production of a European tank."

<F P=106> [Christine McGourty report: "Windscale Safety Below </F>
Standard"] 
  [Text] Serious clean-up problems remain at the Windscale 
nuclear reactor at Sellafield 37 years after the fire there, 
according to a report yesterday by the Health and Safety 
Commission. 
  "A very long programme of work" was needed to make the two 
reactors at the site safe, said the Commission's Advisory 
Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installation (ACSNI). 
  The report described the state of the reactors as generally 
unsatisfactory. 
  "At present they fall far below the `as safe as reasonably 
achievable' criterion," it said. Great care would be needed to 
ensure no radioactivity was released from the reactors to the 
environment during the rest of the clean-up programme. 
  After the 1957 nuclear accident -- one of the world's worst 
-- undamaged nuclear fuel was discharged from Pile One, the 
military reactor where it occurred. 
  But the possibility of another fire still exists since 15 
tons of damaged fuel remain in the core, a further five tons in 
the water and air ducts and the graphite core of the second 
reactor -- known as Pile Two -- still stores vast amounts of 
energy. 
  Mr Eddie Varney, acting chief inspector of the Nuclear 
Installations Inspectorate, said it had been dissatisfied with 
the progress of safety work and had been forced to serve 
improvement notices on the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), which 
is responsible for the site, in 1992, to speed it up. 
  "What was worrying us was that the piles were connected 
through the stacks to the atmosphere," said Mr Varney. "We 
wanted air to circulate through so you could look for a fire. 
The Authority had proposed this but was taking too long to do 
it." 
  An improved ventilation system has since been installed at 
Pile One, reducing the possibility of a radioactive discharge, 
the AEA said yesterday. 
  It said work was underway to remove loose fuel from air and 
water ducts and improve fire detection and suppression systems. 
  ACSNI also criticised storage facilities for nuclear waste 
at 
AEA's Dounreay site. The site has been host to research into a 
new type of reactor but following the withdrawal of Government 
funding, the prototype fast reactor (PFR) is due for closure 
next month. 
  The Dounreay fast reactor (DFR) that was used to test fuel 
for the prototype has already been closed down and 
decommissioning is underway. But ACSNI said the site was "not 
well provided with waste storage capacity. As with the DFR 
breeder fuel, there are no reprocessing or disposal routes 
identified as yet for the PFR breeder."

<F P=106> [Jimmy Walsh report: "Spring Hoping To Allay Unionist </F>
Fears"] 
  [Text] Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] Dick Spring hopes 
it will be possible to convince Northern Unionists that they 
have nothing to fear from working with the Government. 
  Expressing regret at recent comments by James Molyneaux, Mr 
Spring, leader of the UUP [Ulster Unionist Party], told the Dail 
[parliament] yesterday he did not believe a strictly internal 
solution to the Northern problem would work. The most likely 
result of such an approach would be to marginalise the role and 
influence of the leaders of the Unionist community, at a time 
which could be of considerable importance for the future of the 
island. 
  He hoped those leaders would reflect very carefully on their 
position. "Their rightful place is at the negotiating table. 
Recent opinion polls suggest that is where their own electorate, 
as well as the two Governments, wish to see them." 
  Replying to Fine Gael leader John Bruton, the Tanaiste 
stressed that no party had a veto on the resumption of the 
three-stranded talks process. Both Governments were working 
towards a framework to set out a basis for these talks. 
  He hoped very sincerely that electoral considerations would 
not prompt any modification of the generally constructive line 
the Official Unionists had taken over the Downing Street 
Declaration. This agreement was far too important to allow it to 
be exploited by political manoeuvering in the context of the 
European elections. 
  Mr Bruton stressed the importance of the Government making 
contact with the Unionists to dissuade them from pursuing what 
the Taoiseach [prime minister] had aptly called a cul-de-sac. 
The Government should table proposals on strands 2 and 3 of the 
talks process to dispel suspicions -- wrongly held, he believed 
-- in the North that Dublin was not really serious about these 
strands. 
  The Tanaiste replied that efforts had been made over the 
last 
year to build up a relationship with the Unionist parties 
because of the important role they had to play in determining 
the future of this island. The Government would do everything 
possible, including the handing over of papers setting out their 
ideas for solution to the problem, to ensure that any doubts on 
the part of those in the Unionist community were ended. 
  He would be holding further discussions soon with the 
Northern Secretary on how the talks process could be advanced. 
  Mr Spring will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew informally in Dublin 
tomorrow ahead of a full session of the Anglo-Irish Conference 
in London next Thursday [10 March].

<F P=106> [Report by Leon Barkhu: "Paris Expects Blockade on Iraq To </F>
Be Lifted Through Compliance With Resolutions"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris, Baghdad -- French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe said Wednesday [2 March] evening that Iraq has achieved 
"progress" by accepting the UN resolution stipulating the 
imposition of long-term inspection of its armament programs. He 
did not rule out the lifting of the oil blockade if "Baghdad 
complies with its international obligations." During a dinner 
banquet Juppe said: "I believe that Iraq has achieved progress" 
by accepting UN Resolution 715, which stipulates that "its 
weapons of mass destruction be subjected" to UN inspection. The 
minister said that "at another level, we have achieved major 
progress in the work of the special (UN) committee entrusted 
with supervising the elimination of its war arsenal. And we are 
now in a six-month trial period to ascertain whether Iraq is 
complying with its obligations." Baghdad recently stressed that 
it now has no weapons of mass destruction and is no longer 
capable of producing them. 
  Juppe said: "This development should be taken into account 
step by step," pointing out that, if that proves to be the case, 
it will be possible to "use 22" [as published] of Security 
Council Resolution 687, which stipulates that the oil blockade 
imposed on Iraq be lifted if the country implements the Security 
Council resolutions relating to its disarmament. 
  However, Juppe pointed to the existence of other Security 
Council resolutions with which Baghdad has not complied, like 
the resolution on the inviolability of the border between Iraq 
and Kuwait. He said it is a "necessary condition" for Iraq's 
return to the international community. 
  Furthermore, it was learned yesterday from an Arab 
diplomatic 
source that Riyad al-Qaysi, director of international affairs at 
the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, will arrive in Paris today to hold 
talks with French officials. 
  The Iraqi diplomat's arrival has been confirmed by a 
spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry. He pointed out that 
al-Qaysi, who visited Paris last July, "will hold talks with 
officials at the ministry." The spokesman added that "we will 
discuss with him Iraq's position on its international 
obligations stipulated in the Security Council resolutions in 
the light of the contacts made by the special committee 
entrusted with disarming Iraq" under the chairmanship of Rolf 
Ekeus of Sweden. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia: General Cot Calls the </F>
United States to the Rescue"] 
  [Excerpt] Yasushi Akashi, special representative of the UN 
secretary general for the region, said that UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] , which comprises around 14,000 troops in 
Bosnia, needs an additional 10,650 troops immediately, of which 
4,600 would be deployed in Sarajevo and 6,050 would monitor the 
enforcement of the Croatian-Muslim cease-fire in central and 
southern Bosnia. Mr. Akashi said that he was "deeply concerned 
about the reluctant and negative reply" from the international 
community to the reinforcement request for Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, General Cot criticized NATO's attitude because of 
its readiness to send troops to Bosnia only after a 
comprehensive peace agreement has been reached. It is "a funny 
and not very brave decision," he said. "Anyone can change their 
minds and send troops to Bosnia tomorrow morning. I really 
would like the United States to send troops tomorrow morning," 
he added. "I need men immediately, but the nations which could 
dispatch troops immediately can be counted on the fingers of one 
hand," said Cot, who mentioned the United States, Great Britain, 
and France in this regard. 
  "Plans were drawn up by NATO providing for 100,000 troops. 
This was then reduced to 50,000. Today, I am asking for 10,000 
men. If one does not want everything that has been achieved in 
Sarajevo at the cost of incredible efforts to be completely 
undone, then those troops must come immediately," the French 
general stressed. "If they do not come rapidly, I am afraid 
that what has been won will be quickly lost."

  [Text] Paris does not envisage sending any extra troops to 
Bosnia, as called for yesterday [3 March] by General Jean Cot, 
head of the UN peacekeepers, but Paris could examine a 
redeployment of its soldiers stationed in former Yugoslavia. 
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman recalled that France has 
already made the largest contribution, with more than 6,000 men 
deployed there, including nearly 3,000 in Sarajevo alone.

<F P=106> [Report by Afsane Bassir Pour: "France Has Altered Its UN </F>
Draft Resolution To Take Account of Russian and American 
Objections"] 
  [Text] New York (United Nations) -- A resolution on Bosnia 
is due to be put to the vote in the UN Security Council in the 
next few days at France's initiative. However, it differs 
considerably from the initial French plan. 
  France would have liked the United Nations to appoint a 
veritable "administrator" for the city of Sarajevo. This idea 
was curbed from the start by the Americans who regarded it as an 
attack on the Bosnian Government's sovereignty. The modified 
plan now proposes the appointment of a "high-level civilian 
official" who, in "close cooperation" with the Bosnian 
Government, would have the mission of restoring essential public 
services in the Sarajevo area. 
  Russia's objections to the French plan were clearly more 
extensive. With regard to Sarajevo, Moscow opposed the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] taking control of certain road systems and 
intersections, because, they said, their soldiers could thus be 
in a situation of confrontation with the Serbian militias. 
  Russia also opposed the resolution referring to Chapter 7 of 
the UN Charter (which makes provision for the use of force) and 
reaffirming the NATO ultimatum. Finally, it refused to allow 
the use of force to be mentioned with regard to remedying the 
situation in three other Bosnian cities which France proposed 
turning into new "security areas." On Monday [28 February], 
Moscow informed the French delegation that such a plan would 
meet with a Russian veto. 
  However, following Franco-Russian contacts, the deadlock was 
broken on Tuesday and Moscow no longer intends to oppose Paris' 
efforts. According to Russian diplomats to the United Nations, 
Moscow's initial "reservations" were "bureaucratic and not 
political." 
  A compromise document was due to circulate among the other 
members of the Council on Thursday. It calls on all sides to 
"achieve with UN assistance" the full freedom of movement for 
the civilian population of Sarajevo and on the secretary general 
to appoint a civilian official "immediately and for an interim 
period." 
  Taking account of the U.S.-British initiative announced on 
Tuesday by Bill Clinton and John Major, the French resolution 
calls on Mr. Butrus-Ghali to create a fund of voluntary 
contributions for Sarajevo "with a view to promoting a return to 
normal life." Finally, the French plan asks the secretary 
general to draw up a report within 10 days on the "feasibility 
and means of extending" the protection provided for the 
"security areas" to Maglaj, Mostar, and Vitez. 
  Before the vote, Washington could still ask for amendments 
to 
curb the authority of the civilian official who will be 
appointed for Sarajevo, making him "a simple coordinator, or 
even a chief engineer" whereas Paris wants him to have "real 
powers." According to General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR 
commander in chief in Bosnia, the extension of the security 
areas to three other cities requires the deployment of 2,000 to 
3,000 additional soldiers. It seems possible to solve this 
problem because, according to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, Malaysia, 
Bangladesh, and Pakistan have agreed to send "several hundred" 
soldiers to Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Moscow Gives Approval, Paris Fears </F>
`Diplomatic Proliferation'"] 
  [Text] The agreement reached in Washington on Tuesday 1 
March between Bosnian Croats and Muslims has aroused favorable 
reactions, particularly from Moscow. Vitaliy Churkin, Boris 
Yeltsin's representative for the former Yugoslavia, spoke 
Wednesday of a "new turning-point" in the peace negotiations. 
He thinks that the Washington agreement "if it is correctly 
implemented," does not threaten the interests of the Bosnian 
Serbs, but should instead contribute to a settlement to the 
extent that "it makes it possible to solve the complex problems 
which were hampering the discussions" like that of access to the 
sea for the Muslims. 
  In Paris, the foreign minister welcomed this "first step," 
while stressing that the test would be the actual implementation 
of this Croatian-Muslim agreement on the ground, starting with 
respect for the cease-fire, especially in Mostar. Five or six 
shells fell on Tuesday evening on this city in Herzegovina whose 
Muslim district is being besieged by Croatian forces, but the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports a calming of the 
situation on all Croatian-Muslim fronts. Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic announced on Wednesday that Zagreb was 
going to withdraw 1,000 men from constituted units of the 
Croatian army still present in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He explained 
that the negotiations on what practical measures with regard to 
the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim federation, and then 
confederation with Croatia would be continued in Vienna as of 4 
March. They will try to draw up a constitution before 15 March. 
  Mr. Granic was due to have talks in Paris this Thursday with 
Alain Juppe. The previous day, during a luncheon discussion, 
the French foreign minister, while welcoming the involvement of 
Washington and Moscow in the handling of the Bosnian crisis, 
called for a meeting between Americans, Europeans, and Russians 
to prevent "diplomatic proliferation" and "put cohesion into the 
inititatives." With regard to the Washington agreement, the 
minister stressed that many questions still had to be given an 
answer: What territory does this agreement apply to? How can 
it be delimited? What are the Serbs being told? Can 
Croatian-Serbian relations be ignored? "A three-sided problem 
cannot be solved by two," Alain Juppe said, adding that the 
European Union's plan (partition into three entities) "remains 
valid in principle" although it is not "impossible to change." 
  Ankara and Athens welcomed the Croatian-Muslim Washington 
agreement, as did the UNPROFOR, whose spokesman in Sarajevo said 
that it "was in harmony with the efforts being made on the 
ground." In northern Bosnia, the Serbs are still besieging the 
Muslim city of Maglaj which, according to Sarajevo Radio, was 
again subjected to heavy shelling and several infantry attacks 
on Wednesday. The Serb forces have also stopped a HCR [High 
Commission for Refugees] convoy near Sarajevo which was heading 
for Maglaj.

<F P=106> [By Dusan Radovanovic] </F>
  [Text] Paris, March 4 (TANJUG) -- French authorities on 
Thursday [3 March] ran true to form in their anti-Serb 
discrimination policy and clamped their third ban on Serbs' 
peaceful demonstrations in under a month. 
  France banned the Serbs' Europe-wide peaceful protest from 
being staged in Strasbourg on February 6 and their more recent 
rally, organized by the Paris Union of Yugoslav Clubs. This 
discriminatory practice culminated on Thursday in the 
information to the president of the Serbian community in France, 
Ivan Jankovic, of the Paris police decision to ban the latest 
demonstration in Paris, planned for March 6. 
  The demonstration was to take the form of a march from the 
Place de la Republique to the Bastille, to end in a rally for an 
equitable peaceful settlement for war-shattered 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the lifting of anti-Serb sanctions and the 
condemnation of the media demonisation of the Serbs. 
  As the reason for the ban, French authorities again offered 
the well-worn cliche that a Serb rally would "jeopardise public 
law and order." 
  In his protest against the decision, Serbian community 
President Jankovic dismissed the offered pretext as thin and 
groundless, and pointed out that Serb protests in France to date 
had never produced a single incident. 
  Considering the fact that Moslems are allowed to organise 
militantly-intoned demonstrations in France in which they 
clamour for retaliation and military intervention against the 
Serbs, it is obvious that the explanation that a Serb protest 
would be "jeopardising public law and order" is nothing but an 
effort to prevent the Serbs from raising their voice against the 
West's shameful policy towards Serbia, of which Paris is a 
foremost champion. 
  After being denied all access to the French media, which 
continue to foment hatred of Serbia and the Serbs, the Serbs in 
France are now being denied one of the basic democratic rights, 
viz. the right to public and peaceful demonstration. 
  France, which takes every opportunity to boast of its being 
in the forefront of the struggle for human rights, is violating 
in the case of the Serbs some of the basic provisions of the 
human rights declaration, initiated in its soil. 
  The question remains why French authorities have done 
nothing 
to prevent frequent attacks on Yugoslav diplomatic and other 
representations in France. Last month, the Yugoslav Embassy and 
cultural center in Paris were attacked in full view of an 
indifferent police. Shortly before, the Yugoslav consulate in 
Lyon was attacked. 
  No blame has officially been apportioned for the assaults, 
although French authorities have made promises of quick and 
efficient investigation.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In Paris, the French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe said this morning after meeting the 
Palestinian representative Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh [head of PLO 
Information Department] that France would only decide whether to 
send observers to the occupied territories for the United 
Nations when the time came. Juppe nevertheless reaffirmed his 
confidence in the peace process. Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We insist that the security of the 
Palestinian people be effectively guaranteed. This is the only 
way for the peace process to regain its credibility. We 
therefore call on the Israeli authorities, which are responsible 
for security in the occupied territories, to take the necessary 
measures. In particular, I am thinking of the neutralization of 
all the extremists, who want to kill off the peace process, and 
who are well known to the authorities. I am also thinking of 
the fact that the settlers are armed whenever they go around the 
occupied territories. We deem it necessary that these security 
measures be placed under some sort of observation by 
international observers sent by the United Nations. Finally, we 
think that the question of the settlements and their possible 
regrouping has to be negotiated by the parties concerned. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Bastien and Michel de Grandi: "France </F>
Makes Aid for Algeria Dependent on Signature of an Agreement 
With the IMF"] 
  [Text] On his way to the IMF, the Algerian economics 
minister stopped off in Paris to sound out the intentions of the 
French. However, France will wait for multilateral approval 
before unblocking its bilateral credits. 
  Yesterday, on his way to Washington and IMF headquarters, 
the 
Algerian economics minister, Mourad Benachenhou, stopped off in 
Paris, where he met with his French counterpart, Edmond 
Alphandery. The meeting was described as "coming under the 
rubric of usual consultations," between the two countries, the 
Economics Ministry explained yesterday. Consequently, the 
Algerian minister had an opportunity to report on the economic 
situation in Algeria and, more importantly, on the difficult 
discussions currently being conducted between Algiers and the 
IMF. 
  As France has already emphasized since the Balladur 
government took office, "France has reaffirmed its support for 
Algeria," experts from the Economics Ministry reiterated 
yesterday. In 1993, Paris awarded Algeria credits totalling 
nearly 6 billion francs [Fr], 5 billion of which were commercial 
credits (1 billion covering imports of cereals), and 1 billion 
in balance-of- payments aid. However, the French Government 
gave its assurance that new French bilateral credits will only 
be set up when an agreement has been signed with the IMF. 
Moreover, France has assured Algiers of its support among the 
industrialized countries of Europe, with a view to mobilizing 
"sufficient support from the international community" when an 
IMF program has been launched in Algeria, the Economics Ministry 
explained yesterday. 
  The caution displayed by the French Government, in a -- both 
politically and economically -- particularly troubled time in 
Algeria, is in fact motivated by the imminence of an agreement 
between the International Monetary Fund and Algiers, which could 
be forthcoming within the coming weeks. So far, the Algerians 
have not succeeded in concluding such an agreement, due to the 
extremely difficult social consequences of the IMF's demands 
(devaluation of the dinar, liberalization of foreign trade, 
budgetary rigor, privatization, etc.). However, observers 
believe that the recent visit to Algiers by Michel Camdessus 
appears to have pushed things along at the political level. 
<H5>  Algiers in a Financial Impasse </H5>
  Eagerly awaited for several months, this agreement would not 
only unblock new IMF credits (Fr500 million in "stand-by" loans, 
plus Fr300 million in aid for the balance of payments to offset 
Algeria's reduced income from oil, or even an "extended 
facility" in the coming months), and credits from the European 
Union (worth nearly $1 billion), but would also open up the way 
for the Paris Club to reschedule the Algerian national debt 
($13.5 billion out of a total of $26 billion). Both the 
Algerian prime minister, Redha Malek, who returned to office one 
month ago, and the country's new president, Lamine Zeroual, now 
seem ready to accept the restructuring of Algeria's national 
debt that their predecessors had always categorically rejected 
-- on condition that this be done as "tactfully" as possible, 
taking account of domestic policy and the international 
financial markets. 
  Consequently, before it mobilizes new bilateral credits, 
Paris -- which is a privileged partner of Algiers, but intent on 
seeing some light on the Algerian horizon -- is waiting to see 
what the new contributions to multilateral credits will be, and 
possibly to see which concessions on the debt are granted by 
Western governments. 
  As in past years, in 1994 Algiers is having to face up to a 
new financial impasse. The drop in the price of oil will reduce 
its revenue even further this year: revenue of $8 billion for 
oil sales would represent a shortfall of $2 to $3 billion 
compared with 1993. However, $9 billion -- the cost of servicing 
the debt -- will remain exorbitant this year. All of which 
comes down to saying that whatever the voluntary restrictions on 
imports already decided by the government, the need for external 
financing is estimated to reach $4 to $5 billion this year.

  [Text] [Announcer] As we announced earlier, we have 
contacted Defense Minister Fabbri by telephone. Hello, Minister 
Fabbri. In a few words, is it realistic to think that our 
troops might now go to Bosnia? 
  [Fabbri] I do not like calculating probability -- let us 
stick to the facts. As far as we know, the UN position -- that 
they do not want troops from bordering countries to participate 
-- has not changed. We realize that there is a real need to 
reinforce the numbers of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia. If 
we receive a request from the United Nations, the government, as 
a whole, will calmly study the request, giving it all the 
consideration the case demands. We will take all aspects of the 
situation into consideration. Among other things, I want to 
stress that it would be important to know what stance was being 
taken by the warring parties in former Yugoslavia. How would 
they react to the possible future presence of armed Italian 
forces? This does not mean that we are laying down hostile 
conditions about our possible involvement. We are already 
playing our part by ensuring logistic and operational support 
for all operations headed toward former Yugoslavia. Moreover, 
the Italian Armed Forces have already demonstrated in Mozambique 
and Somalia that they are able to carry out peacekeeping, 
peace-enforcing, and humanitarian aid missions in a professional 
manner. 
  [Announcer] One last thing, are you saying that the UN 
Security Council would have to effectively reexamine the matter, 
along with the conditions concerning the involvement of 
neighboring countries and then make a formal request? 
  [Fabbri] That is right. The decision already made by the 
United Nations would have to be revised and a request then made 
to the Italian Government. 
  [Announcer] Thank you, Minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Silvio Berlusconi, chairman of the Forza </F>
Italia party, by correspondent Anne Sinclair in Milan on 4 March 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Sinclair] Good evening. Italy will be going to 
the polls in three weeks' time. It is going through an 
incredible period. [passage omitted] Silvio Berlusconi, good 
evening. 
  [Berlusconi] Good evening to you. 
  [Sinclair] We are recording this program on Friday evening 
[4 
March] in Milan because you will be campaigning throughout the 
country tomorrow and on Sunday. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] If you come to power, do you intend to sell your 
group? Will such private interests be compatible with the 
responsibilities of a prime minister, a European prime minister? 
  [Berlusconi] Is TF1 interested in buying us up? [laughs] 
  [Sinclair] I don't think so. This is a serious question. Is 
it possible to be a prime minister and to have so many private 
interests? 
  [Berlusconi] It must be pointed out that, if we, as a 
political party, are responsible for setting up a government, it 
is obvious that it will not be possible to submit to my judgment 
or ask me to intervene in any problem likely to concern my group 
directly or indirectly. 
  [Sinclair] I did not mean the daily management of your 
group. 
It is obvious that if you are the prime minister, you will not 
manage Fininvest, your group, directly. My question was a 
question in principle: Is it possible today to be a major 
private entrepreneur, to have one's own private capital and 
govern a leading country? 
  [Berlusconi] There have already been precedents. I know what 
is happening in the United States, for example. There, it is 
provided by law that, when someone has responsibilities within a 
government, political responsibilities, this person must resign 
from all posts in their group and distance themselves from the 
decisions regarding the group. I think that we may go in that 
direction. I also believe that we may sell most or all of the 
group's stakes if need be. But it is a prerequisite for me to 
be given responsibilities within the government, really. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] Earlier you mentioned the National Alliance -- 
everyone has adopted new names for these elections -- it was 
called the MSI [Italian Social Movement] not so long ago and 
they were known as Neo-Fascists. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, 
who lost in the last Rome elections -- you gave him your support 
at the time -- is calling himself a post-Fascist. Isn't it a 
problem to be allied with a party in which Alessandra Mussolini 
is invoking her grandfather, a party that put cassettes of the 
Duce on sale at its last meeting? Didn't you demand a public 
renunciation from them? 
  [Berlusconi] This does not correspond to reality. 
Adversaries gave this picture of this party. 
  [Sinclair] Bossi himself said that Fini was a Fascist. 
  [Berlusconi] It was an election speech, it must be 
understood 
that he needs to reassure his supporters, to find other 
positions and an identity. I believe that the French must be 
told that Mr. Fini is no more on the right than Mr. Chirac is in 
France. [passage omitted] 
  [Sinclair] The former Yugoslavia has a frontier with Italy, 
so it is a subject that is of great concern to you, and we don't 
know at all what you think about it. I suppose that like all 
Europeans you supported the ultimatum? 
  [Berlusconi] Certainly. I would only say that we waited too 
long. There was a degree of over-caution in Europe about 
intervening like this and about setting the ultimatum. I think 
France was right, and Italy too, but we should have done it 
earlier. 
  [Sinclair] General Cot, who commands the UN forces 
throughout 
the former Yugoslavia, is demanding to be sent extra troops 
urgently, because they not only have to act as buffer between 
belligerents, but also to occupy and guard the protected zones. 
  [Berlusconi] I think Europe should take on more 
responsibility here, because today we have a situation that is 
somewhat dangerous, with America supporting the Croat-Muslim 
confederation, and Russia supporting Serbia. We have let two 
non-European countries into the Mediterranean, allowed them to 
get involved in a problem that affects us, a problem that 
belongs to us. I think Europe should in the future be more 
involved, and make more resolute interventions. 
  [Sinclair] If you head the government tomorrow, you would 
take the initiative on this? 
  [Berlusconi] I have said several times that all the foreign 
ministers should be brought together to discuss this burning 
question. 
  [Sinclair] That is often done. 
  [Berlusconi] Yes, but permanently. To make decisions with 
more courage. 
  [Sinclair] Unfortunately, Europe does not yet have a foreign 
policy nor a defense policy. You are a convinced European, a 
convinced Maastricht man. You think that is the right way 
forward? 
  [Berlusconi] Certainly. I am convinced that Europe also has 
to be enlarged and opened up to all the countries of East Europe. 
  [Sinclair] Opened up to all the countries of East Europe, 
but 
aren't you afraid that too great an economic disparity might 
drive a wedge through the homogeneity of the European Twelve? 
  [Berlusconi] No, we have systems to give the countries of 
the 
Treaty of Rome greater weight. But I think that if Europe wants 
to face up to the other world powers, it must be strong and be 
truly representative of European geography. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Claudio Rinaldi: "The Poisoned Plebiscite: The </F>
Right Attacks: An Unfair Fight?"] 
  [Text] Overwhelming mass media. Shovelfulls of money. 
Nonpolitical agreements. The trio Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi is not 
competing with its adversaries on equal terms. And if the latter 
do not react, the campaign could become a walkover. 
  You are a party of the center or of the left. Do you want to 
use television advertising? You have to go to Fininvest. And 
there you have two choices. You can pay full price for the ads, 
and you are ruined. Or, you can accept Fininvest's super 
discount, which is even worse: in effect, you accept financing 
from the Milanese tycoon, and you even have to declare it in 
accordance with the law. Do you see the absurdity? Those who 
want to combat the politician Berlusconi on television must 
accept money from the businessman Berlusconi. And probably have 
to tell him: thank you, and what a pluralist you are. 
  It is just an example, not even the most important, of the 
distortions introduced into the political contest by the entry 
of the owner of Fininvest. These distortions are making a fixed 
match out of this electoral campaign because of the enormous 
disproportion between the political forces in the contest. They 
further give an artificial and vaguely repugnant appearance to 
the rise of the Right, an outcome which the polls predict. 
  The Right was strong to begin with, very strong. Never in 
power, the Lega and the MSI [Italian Social Movement] had stolen 
much less than the others: while the winds of Clean Hands were 
blowing, they could demonstrate a kind of virginity. In 
addition, they had two first rate leaders. Bossi is coarse and 
Fini pedantic, but both are capable of appealing to many sectors 
in Italy. But neither of the two would have created a triumphant 
Right without Silvio Berlusconi, the man who was described on 
the cover of L'ESPRESSO last November as "the vote gatherer" 
while many were still pondering the misleading question of 
whether or not he would run.? 
  Berlusconi has made headway with a deployment of forces 
never 
before seen, beyond the reach of any other rival. By now, 
everything is known about the limitless television and newspaper 
empire that the state and the banks have allowed him to own. But 
little attention is paid to how that empire is used, in which 
moments of impartiality are rare. The chief's adversaries are 
attacked mercilessly; on the other hand, television coverage of 
him abounds and favorable interviews appear even in nonpolitical 
newspapers. Television stations beat the drum for Forza Italia, 
mobilizing stars and starlets; the magazines even distribute 
postcards to register. But above all, Berlusconi's mass media 
are used to condition the mass media that he does not own. The 
uproar against RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] is an 
extreme case, with grotesque results, such as the gag imposed on 
the satire "Tunnel," but it is not the only one. Every day 
Fininvest's powerful resources warn the state-owned television 
news programs and independent daily newspapers against rubbing 
Berlusconi the wrong way; or else the rumor will be spread that 
the other news media owners have taken sides with the left. It 
is impressive firepower. Umberto Bossi himself recognized it 
when he admitted that without an agreement with Berlusconi, his 
League party would have risked being "literally cancelled." 
  But this is only the best known aspect of Berlusconi's 
power. 
There are others. For starters, money: Berlusconi has 
incomparably more of it than his adversaries. His companies 
(Standa [department store chain]) do not pay their suppliers, 
they delay paying eminent collaborators like Maurizio Costanzo 
(Channel 5) for months, they even leave the winners of 
television quiz shows ("Yes or No") high and dry; but the money 
reaches Forza Italia through a hundred mechanisms already 
described by CORRIERE DELLA SERA. This behavior may well be 
described as immoral, but it has the advantage of nourishing the 
network of clubs without risking criminal penalties. This is 
because, according to the law of 1974, a private company can 
subsidize a party without limits, on the one condition that the 
contributions be approved by the board of directors and 
described in the balance sheet. Well, Fininvest is not at all 
embarrassed to openly finance the Forza Italia clubs since they 
both have the same owner. For the PDS [Democratic Party of the 
left] and the PPI [Italian Popular Party], however, it would be 
impossible to find a financier who would agree to appear as such. 
  That is not all. Only Berlusconi can count on thousands of 
yes-men trained for years to the cult of the chief. This is why 
his party, created from above by managerial decision and 
entrusted to masses of paid employees, can establish in two 
months the 9,000 offices that would cost other groups the work 
of generations; and it is the only party that does not have and 
structurally cannot have internal conflicts. Forza Italia is 
also the only organization that gathers support effortlessly for 
non-political reasons: from the major bankers who risk seeing 
their credits go up in smoke to the small suppliers left waiting 
for payment, the country is full of people who have a material 
interest that Berlusconi's political adventure not end in a 
catastrophe. This does not account for the fact that 
Berlusconi the businessman, moving between commercial 
television, supermarkets and soccer teams, also has 
non-political know-how in manipulating the emotions of the crowd. 
  It is the sum of these elements of strength that confers on 
Berlusconi's campaign the unpleasant appearance of a walkover, 
and leads one to blame the right for conducting an unfair 
contest. It is not competing with the Center and the Left on 
equal terms. And the evidence is to be found not only in the 
rapidity with which the Right seems to grow, but especially in 
the speed with which Berlusconi has become the undisputed head 
of the entire alliance, supplanting within a few weeks Bossi and 
Fini, who are superior to him in charisma and in real political 
following. 
  It is obvious that Berlusconi, besides being powerful, is 
able. He knows well how to use the immense arsenal he possesses. 
He has represented his entrance into the contest as a 
long-awaited and long-feared event, by means of a show of 
pretended hesitations and reconsiderations which few recognized 
from the beginning as designed to mislead. Moreover,the great 
event has been transformed quickly into many minor events: the 
cassette with the recorded appeal on television news, the 
convention in Rome transmitted in its entirety on Channel 4, the 
refusal to take part in direct debate, the call-ins on RAI talk 
shows. By contrast, the Left has created a campaign totally 
devoid of events, except for such negative ones as agreements 
with Communist Renewal, tiresome negotiations over candidacies 
conducted by small, petulant groups, and now involvement in 
judicial investigations. Even the name chosen, "progressives," 
is abstruse, it is a word no one ever uses; and the symbol is 
ugly. 
  In 1978, Enrico Berlinguer, who did not have television, 
knew 
how to create one grand event. It was enough for him to say, in 
an interview with Giampaolo Pansa, that he accepted NATO's 
protective umbrella. There is a need for equally striking and 
serious gestures today. Otherwise, only a miracle will be able 
to stop the Right.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Our Currency Collapses to 993 Lire </F>
in Relation to the German Mark -- Milan and Other Stock 
Exchanges Give In -- Sales Snowball in London -- Spaventa Says: 
`Keep Calm, The Economy Is on Course'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The drop in interest rates "has come to a 
halt," at least for the next two months. From an economic point 
of view, "Italy is OK" although political uncertainty will still 
be felt over the next two months. Budget Minister Luigi 
Spaventa, who will be running as a progressive candidate in the 
upcoming elections, entered the field to comment on the 
difficult stage which our economy -- jolted by turbulence on the 
international markets -- is currently undergoing. Spaventa made 
a number of statements yesterday [2 March] on TG2 [TV news]: 
"Regarding the lira's [L] exchange rate," the budget minister 
said, "I do not believe that there is any reason for serious 
concern, at least not as long as these fluctuations take place 
below the L1000 to 1 German mark level." On the other hand, 
relative to interest rates, Spaventa stated "the drop has 
already been interrupted. In fact, we have experienced a rise. 
I am afraid that this climate of uncertainty or, in any case, 
the fact that the rates have not dropped further," he added, 
"may continue for another couple of months." 
  As a matter of fact, according to the progressive candidate, 
it is political uncertainty which is disturbing the markets 
most. Spaventa explained why "when it rains elsewhere, here in 
Italy it hails." The budget minister believes that "as [Prime 
Minister] Ciampi said, we are OK from an economic point of view 
in the areas of checking inflation and adjusting our balance of 
payments. If we are considered to be at risk, this is largely 
due to the political uncertainty which will continue for several 
more months. The most harmful effect will be felt, in fact, in 
terms of the interest rates, given the repercussions the 
increased cost of the debt will have on overcoming the deficit 
in public funds."

<F P=106> ["m.p." report: "Everyone Is Fighting on the Personal </F>
Income Tax Front"] 
  [Text] Perhaps the most significant part of the parties' 
electoral programs are those relating to taxation. The signals 
of increasing intolerance of fiscal pressures, which the League 
has gathered and ridden in recent years, have been picked up by 
everyone, and everyone has taken a stance on taxes. In many 
cases positions are fairly well defined, with programs on fiscal 
decentralization, tax pressure, the distribution of revenues 
between direct and indirect taxes, the reduction in the number 
of taxes, and tax policies to stimulate investment and 
employment. Among them, the topic which has suddenly become a 
hot potato is income tax, the famous and infamous 740. This is 
the electorally most sensitive tax, the one people notice the 
most because it affects their pocketbook. 
<H5>  The Right </H5>
  The proposal which opened the debate on this topic is that 
of 
Forza Italia, which intends to apply a single income tax rate of 
30 percent regardless of people's income, thereby radically 
changing the present system with its so-called "progression," by 
which the rate rises with the level of earnings. However, Forza 
Italia completes its proposal with a series of deductions and 
exemptions (not detailed in the electoral program), which would 
effectively lower to well below 30 percent the amount which 
those in the lowest brackets would have pay. According to a 
purely rationalistic calculation, this system, which would 
reduce the revenue coming from the highest tax brackets and 
maintain more or less unchanged that coming from the medium and 
lower brackets, would lead to an overall reduction of taxation. 
Forza Italia's economists believe that the reduction would be 
more than compensated for by receipts from taxable income from 
many of those people who have until now evaded, owing to, among 
other things, excessively high rates. 
  Among the parties of the right, the League's program, which 
devotes a large amount of space to tax federalization, limits 
itself, on the issue of personal income tax, to proposing a 
reduction in the levy, without further details. The National 
Alliance's program proposes "lightening the tax pressure on 
citizens and on companies, while adopting special forms of 
protection for families in general and for single-income 
families in particular." 
<H5>  The Center </H5>
  The Pact for Italy lists seven "pacts" which Italy's 
citizens 
need to make with the state. The first of these is the "tax 
pact." On personal income tax, there are two proposals: the 
first is for a "tax rate structure which means that, taking the 
different taxes as a whole, in no case will the total amount 
levied exceed one-third of the income of any physical person or 
corporate body;" while the second provides that "personal income 
tax should refer not to the single individual but to the family 
nucleus." 
  This is what is presented in the official program. Yesterday 
Pact leader Mario Segni spoke of reducing the number of tax 
rates to three or four (from the present seven) and introducing 
tax deductions for the lowest brackets. Augusto Fantozzi, a 
lecturer in tax law and the draftsman of the taxation portion of 
the Pact's program, distancing himself a little from the maximum 
rate of one-third of income, spoke yesterday of reducing the 
maximum rate to 40 to 45 percent. 
  The Italian Popular Party has not yet published its 
electoral 
program. 
<H5>  The Left </H5>
  The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also devoted much 
space to its tax reform program. For personal income tax in 
particular, the proposal is to reduce the number of tax rate 
levels, setting the maximum level at approximately 40 percent. 
The reduction in income which this solution would involve could 
be offset by the elimination of a large part of the deductions, 
and reducing privileges and possibilities of evasion. 
  The Democratic Alliance [AD] too denounces the excessive 
level of tax rates and suggests that they be reduced. However, 
its program becomes original when it suggests "converting 
personal income tax into a tax with a high degree of expense 
deductions, along the U.S. model. This -- as is written in the 
AD program -- would make it possible to introduce a generalized 
conflict of interests between taxpayers, with everyone having an 
interest in documenting the income of the other, in order to be 
able to deduct it as costs, thereby facilitating a widening of 
the tax base." The AD also proposes "shifting the burden of 
income tax from work to a tax on consumption, with particular 
emphasis on reducing the taxation on income from dependent 
employment." 
  Communist Renewal finally, proposes "reducing income tax, 
with priority given to incomes equal to or below the average 
wage of an operator in the industrial sector and with the total 
recovery of fiscal "drag." In order to increase tax equity and 
recover income Communist Renewal proposes "including all income 
toward the personal income tax and thereby eliminating areas of 
erosion, elusion, and evasion, not to mention the many tax 
reductions."

<F P=106> [Interview with Civil Service Minister Sabino Cassese by </F>
Massimo Giannini; place and date not given: "I, the Thomas Mann 
of Ministers"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Giannini] Minister, 
this business of the 400,000 new jobs has something incredible 
about it. Have you started engaging in the election campaign 
now? 
  [Cassese] It is strange. Overnight, I, who have always been 
accused of being too rigorous, too strict, or even an enemy of 
public employees, have become -- according to some newspapers, 
trade unionists, and politicians -- a dispenser of jobs for the 
boys or a reckless waster of public funds. And it is a very 
strange that these accusations are coming partly from those who 
until yesterday were arguing the need for the public 
administration to absorb -- by law and without controls -- 
personnel from crisis-ridden enterprises or bankrupt firms. 
  [Giannini] With whom do you take issue, Minister? 
  [Cassese] I could cite many instances, from Federconsorzi 
[Italian Federation of Landowners Consortia] to EFIM 
[Manufacturing Industry Holding and Financial Company], and from 
the Cellulose Holding Company to Enichem [National Hydrocarbons 
Corporation Chemicals Division]. 
  [Giannini] Very well, but let us return to the subject: Is 
the aim to regain the respect of public employees a matter of 
days before the elections? 
  [Cassese] I did not promise anyone anything: In the document 
I never mentioned 300,000-400,000 new jobs just in 1994. 
Indeed, I clearly specified that the envisaged competitions 
will not be completed before the end of the year because of the 
large numbers of applicants and the slowness of the procedures. 
  [Giannini] So if it was not an electoral move, please tell 
us 
what it was. Because there are two possibilities: Either you 
miscalculated, or we were laboring under a misconception when we 
thought that the public administration needed to be streamlined 
considerably. 
  [Cassese] Both those suggestions are mistaken. The truth is 
much simpler. There is no doubt that the public administrations 
must contain their recruitment, both because of the need to cut 
public spending and in order to restore the efficiency of the 
administrative machinery. This is indeed the thrust of Law 537 
of 1993, by introducing such fundamental innovations as a 
ceiling on recruitment and cuts in staffing levels. Keep in 
mind, however, that the law refers to the number of jobs 
occupied as at 31 August 1993. 
  [Giannini] What does that mean? 
  [Cassese] It means that the law does not annul any 
competitions initiated or authorized by that date. The 22,000 
recruitments envisaged for the ministries, investigated by the 
public administration department, result from competitions 
initiated or authorized between 1988 and 31 August 1993. In 
other words, these jobs were planned long ago and were budgeted 
for in the draft budget for 1994, so there will be no additional 
burden on public funds and no gaps will be created in current 
expenditure. Apart from this, some of these recruitments are to 
replace staff that have retired in the interim. 
  [Giannini] This is another puzzle. Did the reform not in 
fact envisage attrition? 
  [Cassese] Yes, but in a flexible form, inasmuch as it 
applies 
to 10 percent of state employees and 50 percent of health staff, 
but does not apply to local government, education, and the 
Justice Ministry. So those who retire will be replaced, albeit 
at proportionately lower levels. 
  [Giannini] Very well, but you went further than that. You 
also made a rather rash prediction: Since the new jobs refer 
only to the ministries which, with their 270,000 jobs, represent 
one-fourteenth of the 3.7 million employees who constitute the 
total labor force of the public administration, if you multiply 
the 22,000 recruitments by 14, that means some 300,000 new jobs. 
You will agree, Minister, that this is rather rash at such 
times as these... 
  [Cassese] Statistics are not an opinion. The figure of 
300,000 new jobs resulted from a simple exercise in inductive 
inference. 
  [Giannini] Please, Minister, do not make us long for a 
return 
to political jargon. 
  [Cassese] Let me explain: The statistical simulation was 
carried out by projecting onto the entire body of public 
employees the ratio between the number of jobs offered or 
authorized before 31 August 1993 in the sector of civilian 
ministry employees and the relative number of staff currently 
employed. 
  [Giannini] But of the 22,000 jobs to which you refer only 
18,000 apply to the Interior, Finance, and Justice Ministries, 
that is, the only three ministries that objectively need to be 
strengthened. Why, instead of confining yourself to an 
estimate, did you not carry out a detailed examination of 
employment in other sectors of the public administration? 
  [Cassese] Such a study has been carried out: An examination 
of the offers of employment published in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE 
revealed that some 60,000 jobs were offered in 1991, 45,000 in 
1992, and 61,000 in 1993. As you can see, the result has not 
changed much. 
  [Giannini] Pardon me, Minister, but if there are the 
excesses 
in staffing levels that you are constantly criticizing, on the 
basis of what principle are new staff to be taken on? 
  [Cassese] There are two fundamental reasons. First, there 
are some administrations in which staffing levels are too high 
and others in which they are too low, and since the new staff 
mobility procedures have not yet come into effect it is 
difficult to move personnel from one area to another. Second, 
the competitions already initiated or authorized, such as those 
referring to the 22,000 new jobs, cannot and must not be halted, 
as Article 3 of the measure attached to the Finance Bill also 
envisages, for that matter. In other words, our pledges to the 
public must be honored. 
  [Giannini] Precisely. Are you not afraid that your 
initiative may have damaged your image as a kind of Cato the 
Censor which you have acquired through your work and for which 
the Italian people have appreciated you over the months? 
  [Cassese] These are political assessments, photographic 
stills from an electoral show involving many old and new 
protagonists that does not interest me. I am more concerned 
about the community, the ordinary people in the audience. I 
remain convinced that the unemployment problem cannot be 
resolved by using the public sector to create jobs directly. 
But I do not consider it unseemly for the public administration 
to inform the public -- as the newspapers do through their job 
advertisements -- about departments that have initiated 
competitions and are offering places. 
  [Giannini] Yes, but at present, with [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi brandishing the chimera of a million new jobs, it was 
obvious that your offer would seem like an empty promise, too. 
  [Cassese] These political subtleties escape me. 
  [Giannini] Well, you are a teacher, after all... 
  [Cassese] Yes, indeed. Do you know what one of my favorite 
books is? "Confessions of an Impolitic." This government, this 
country, needed my contribution at a certain stage: I have made 
it by saying and doing the things that I believe in. That is 
all there is to it.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In his "Politics Portuguese-Style" 
column in the 12 February EXPRESSO, Jose Antonio Saraiva 
addresses the issue of relations between President Mario Soares 
and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva. He cites the conclusion of the 
prime minister's television appearance, in which Cavaco Silva 
stressed, in "words lacking sincerity," that he respects Soares, 
"who has served the country well in spite of some 
disagreements"...and has every right to end his term in dignity 
and respected by all. It is obvious from the prime minister's 
words that the tactics of his relationship with the president 
have changed, becoming "more sophisticated, more cynical, but 
politically more effective," Saraiva writes. Until recently, 
Cavaco Silva was suggesting that the president was not helping 
the government in its task or that he intervened in its action. 
By so doing, the prime minister was placing himself in an 
inferior position, for he acknowledged that Soares possesses the 
means to either facilitate or complicate the government's task 
and that indeed the government depends on Soares. Grasping the 
implications of Cavaco Silva's tactics, the president took full 
advantage of them, Saraiva continues, "subtly threatening to 
dissolve the Parliament for many months." However, the situation 
changed after the municipal elections, when the PSD "cleverly" 
presented the results as a "half-victory" for itself, defeating 
the specter of parliamentary dissolution. Cavaco Silva's 
television appearance put the final touch on the new situation, 
for it promoted the idea that the president's future depends on 
the prime minister's good will, Saraiva concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The recent congress of the Social 
Democratic Center Party/Popular Party (CDS/PP) has aroused press 
interest in a party seen by noted political commentator and 
Social Democratic Party (PSD) luminary Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa 
as possessing specific characteristics. Writing in the 21 
February Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, he notes that while 
the CDS has always had good members, it has lacked electoral 
exposure and weight and never succeeded in attracting voters. 
The CDS, which has also been unable to create a party machine, 
has suffered from ideological "confusion," Rebelo de Sousa 
continues. In fact, never "populist," the party includes a 
"measure of Christian democracy, some conservatism, a degree of 
liberalism and social-Catholicism, as well as centrist 
tendencies." Rebelo de Sousa concedes, however, that the CDS/PP 
fields good candidates in municipal elections, many of whom have 
won the race. Finally, under the leadership of present chairman 
Manuel Monteiro, the party has modified its original Europeanist 
principles, which now have taken an antifederalist tinge. 
  Reviewing the results of the party congress, Rebelo de Sousa 
notes that it brought about the CDS's reconciliation with former 
leader Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who resigned from the party some 
years ago. Secondly, the congress stressed the importance of the 
next European Parliament elections, in which Monteiro will lead 
the CDS list, despite the fact that his domestic policy lacks 
"weight, density, and credibility." Rebelo de Sousa also notes 
that one of the CDS's problems is the attempt to deprive the PSD 
of an absolute majority. Were Monteiro to fail, the CDS would 
lose its bet. Were he to succeed, the PSD could seek an alliance 
with the CDS, but Prime Minister Cavaco Silva would never lead 
such an alliance. It would thus be "bad business" for the CDS to 
ally itself with a party in crisis without Cavaco Silva at its 
head, Rebelo de Sousa contends. Finally, were Monteiro to 
succeed, the CDS would again lose because the alternative would 
be a leftist government, he concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The 19 February Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO 
published an interview by Jose Vegar with Socialist Party (PS) 
leader Antonio Guterres in which the latter rejected an 
electoral alliance with the Communist Party (PCP). In addition, 
he stressed that an "autonomous" PS would attract many communist 
voters, for he sees no reason why those who voted for the PCP 
should vote instead for the PS. Asked to comment on his belief 
that the PS's support comes from the middle class, Guterres 
noted that for the PS to win an election, it must attract a 
significant share of those who voted for the PSD in 1991 and did 
not vote again for it in the last municipal elections. 
Consequently, the PS must appeal, not only to the less 
privileged classes, but also to the "dynamic sectors" of 
society, without being "the party of the excluded." Asked 
whether this means the center-left, Guterres agreed, noting that 
this is where his party belongs. He stressed the view that there 
is no distinction today between democratic socialism and social 
democracy, despite the fact that his party does not resemble the 
PSD, which "for historical and accidental reasons has a name 
that does not correspond to its ideology." Guterres expressed 
his belief that the state's role is to "regulate and promote 
social justice and equality of opportunity," for the market, 
without which it is "impossible to guarantee the efficient 
functioning of the economy," cannot achieve these goals. 
  Guterres was also queried on his recent statement that 
Portugal must have a strategy vis-a-vis Spain. The PS leader 
replied that Lisbon must defend Portuguese interests and should 
not accept a "regional and peripheral" position within Europe 
with regard to Spain. Finally, when asked whether Portugal ought 
to participate actively in a possible NATO intervention in 
Bosnia, Guterres said that while Portugal should not refuse to 
contribute to peace missions, Portuguese Armed Forces should 
have a greater role to play in peace processes in the former 
Portuguese colonies than in the former Yugoslavia, whose 
relations with Lisbon are not of primary importance.

Antonio Guterres's request to participate in the list for the 
party's National Commission. Constancio's return to active 
partisan politics is considered "a very important event" by the 
PS leadership. The political apparatus' "boss," Jorge Coelho, 
saw it as a "great contribution to the party's central objective 
of winning the 1995 legislative elections." 
  Together with Constancio, Jaime Gama, Torres Couto, and Jose 
Lello also returned to the party's higher leadership. The list 
proposed by Guterres, which will go to a vote on 25 February, 
also includes former Social Democratic Party (PSD) member Helena 
Roseta. Guterres now hopes to convince Constancio to head the PS 
list for the European Parliament elections. Decisions will be 
made after Guterres's reelection as secretary general, expected 
on 11 March. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The 12 February Lisbon daily PUBLICO 
reports the results of a PUBLICO-NORMA political preference poll 
conducted in continental Portugal between 19 and 28 January 
among 995 individuals over 18, with a commentary by Joaquim 
Trigo de Negreiros. The poll carried a 2.3 percent margin of 
error. Results showed that the Socialist Party (PS) improved its 
score from last December, going from 34.83 percent to 37.7 
percent. It thus narrowed the gap with the Social Democratic 
Party (PSD), whose score dropped from 48.91 percent in December 
to 45.9 percent. While the PSD still maintains a "comfortable" 
lead of 8 percentage points over the PS, Trigo de Negreiros 
points out that a month ago, the gap between the two parties was 
nearly 14 percent. The scores of the Communist Party (PCP) 
remained practically unchanged (9.99 percent in December to the 
present 10.2 percent), as did those of the Social Democratic 
Center Party (CDS) (3.59 percent to 4.2 percent).

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In light of the appointment of Admiral 
Fuzeta da Ponte as the new Armed Forces Chief of Staff (CEMFGA), 
press articles have focused on the complements and strength of 
the Portuguese Armed Forces. 
  The 17 February Lisbon weekly VISAO detailed the composition 
of the Armed Forces. According to the weekly, the Army has 
21,648 men and women (447 women officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and privates in administrative positions). The ranks 
of officers and noncommissioned officers were thinned out in 
recent years: There were 10,911 in 1973, 7,728 in 1990, and 
6,381 at the end of 1993, at which time volunteers represented 
32 percent of the force (6,905 officers and noncommissioned 
officers), almost equal to the career force. The Navy's total 
strength is 11,210, including 151 women. Some 5,026 sailors are 
career and 1,088 are volunteers. The Air Forces' total strength 
is 7,754, of whom 1,752 are officers, 2,609 are noncommissioned 
officers, and 3,393 are airmen. There is one four-star general 
and 10 three-star generals, 804 captains, 362 lieutenants, 184 
majors, 166 second lieutenants, 140 lieutenant colonels, 60 
colonels, 16 brigadiers, and two cadets. The Air Force has the 
highest number of women volunteers, including a lieutenant 
colonel and five lieutenants. 
  According to Cesar Camacho writing in the 24 February Lisbon 
daily PUBLICO, while the Independent Mechanized Brigade 
dedicated to NATO needs volunteers to maintain the necessary 
level of preparedness and operational capability, it does have 
the required number of officers and noncommissioned officers. 
Camacho notes that the lack of privates stems from the "drastic" 
reduction of compulsory military service to no more than four 
months, "sufficient for little else besides basic training." 
Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira is cited as believing that 
the offer of technical-professional training to new recruits 
will attract volunteers. He has therefore given his approval to 
the creation of a professional training center in the field of 
civil engineering, including disciplines such as civil 
construction design, stone masonry, carpentry, electricity, etc. 
Other, higher-level courses in accounting, civil construction, 
and technical management are already offered.

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Center Democrats: The WEU Isn't </F>
Everything"] 
  [Text] Mimi Jakobsen, minister of Business Policy and 
Coordination of the Western European Union and leader of the 
Center Democrats, confirmed that getting closer to the Western 
European Union [WEU] is a central -- but not a deciding -- 
demand of a new government in which the Center Democrats will 
participate. The Center Democrats are in an electoral alliance 
with the Liberal and Conservative Parties for the European 
Parliament elections. 
  The leader of the Center Democrats [CD], Business Policy and 
Coordination Minister Mimi Jakobsen, agreed with her policy 
spokesman, Peter Duetoft, when he announced yesterday that 
Danish membership in the WEU must be a part of the basis for a 
new government. 
  "It won't be the deciding factor, but it is one of the 
points 
the CD will fight for. It's entirely natural," Jakobsen said. 
  She said that there was nothing new in the fact that the CD 
is working in favor of membership in the WEU, but the CD's 
partner in the coalition government, Foreign Minister Niels 
Helveg Petersen (Radical Liberal Party), was not enthusiastic 
about Duetoft's statement, which he believes is "ill timed." 
  "We have a government and the basis for a 
government, so I would also like to point out that when putting 
together a government you can't promise that Denmark will or 
will not be part of the WEU," Helveg Petersen said. 
  He finds the debate important, but believes it is too 
restrictive just to debate the WEU. 
  "The WEU is in fact just a very small detail. On the other 
hand, we do want to have a broad national debate about the 
entire changed security policy situation in Europe. It's 
needed," the foreign minister said. 
  The CD will not get unexpected support from the Conservative 
and Liberal Parties in starting now to introduce membership in 
the WEU as part of the basis for forming a future government. 
The Liberal and Conservative parties have in fact just formed an 
electoral alliance with the CD for the European Parliament 
elections in June. 
  "It is a completely absurd situation for Denmark to be the 
only European NATO country that is just there as an observer 
while the WEU, with the blessing of the United States, has begun 
to play a role in European security. We must have a discussion 
about this, something the government has thus far rejected. For 
that reason it is a brilliant idea for the CD to have made 
inroads in the discussion," said former Foreign Minister Uffe 
Ellemann-Jensen (Liberal Party). 
  The Conservatives' Kent Kirk believes the present foreign 
minister is neglecting the importance of the WEU. 
  "WEU membership will be a very significant policy element in 
connection with the creation of a new government," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jukka Perttu: "Why May Defense Goods Be Exported </F>
to Indonesia and Turkey?"] 
  [Text] Vammas Oy received permission from the government to 
export 60 mortars to Indonesia. Sisu-Auto Oy in turn received 
permission to export bulletproof Nasu all-terrain trucks to 
Turkey. 
  In the explanation of the law regulating the exportation of 
defense goods from the country it is stated, among other things, 
that exportation of the goods is not permitted to crisis regions 
or to countries in which there are serious human rights 
violations. 
  Aapo Polho, office director in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, asks if it is not true that human rights violations of 
the type that occurred with the Indonesian occupation of East 
Timor would prevent arms exports to Indonesia. 
  "The matter cannot be simplified in this way. The government 
has decided that the CSCE and EU [European Union] criteria, 
which are considerably more precise than the Finnish law, which 
leaves a good deal of room for interpretation, will also be used 
as bases for licensing. At present neither Indonesia nor Turkey 
is the object of sanctions by the UN Security Council or the EU. 
Finland condemns human rights violations in East Timor just as 
elsewhere. 
  ``A working group headed by the Ministry of Defense recently 
considered how the EU and CSCE criteria would be applied in 
Finland. In practice it would mean that supervision would expand 
to cover many more products than at present, for example cameras 
and computer programs intended to be a part of certain weapon 
systems.'' 
  Has the export licensing policy been relaxed or is it being 
relaxed somewhat? 
  "Licensing policy is neither being tightened nor relaxed in 
applying the EU and CSCE criteria -- it is just being made more 
precise. The present law permits a situation in which the 
interpretations change even monthly. In this case it is 
difficult for manufacturers to plan their output. For preserving 
Finland's defense capability it is important that Finland also 
have an arms industry." 
  Bulletproof all-terrain trucks may be exported to Turkey. 
Are 
the Nasus of such a civilian nature that they may be exported 
anywhere at all? 
  "It depends a little on how they are equipped. Those that 
are 
bulletproofed require a license, but those that are not 
protected do not." 
  May Nasus without bulletproofing be exported to Sudan, 
Somalia, or Burundi, for example? 
  "Their exportation in principle does not require a license 
at 
all, but according to the new lists that are being prepared, 
they too will be included in the monitoring without further ado." 
  May mortars be exported to Great Britain although it is 
waging war in Northern Ireland? 
  "Yes. There is no state of war there but rather the 
disturbances in Northern Ireland involve problems of internal 
security."

  [Excerpts] Russians in Finland are about to set up a 
national organization to pursue their rights. The aim is to 
develop the language, culture, and minority rights of the old 
and new Russians. The reform of civic rights that is being 
discussed in parliament mentions small minority groups such as 
Jews and Tatars. During the preparation of the language rights 
paragraph that is to be included in the constitution, the 
Somalis were discussed, but there was no talk of the Russians in 
Finland. According to a researcher of minority rights, a 
mention of the Russians would have been appropriate. Tapani 
Leisti reports: 
  [Leisti] According to the Central Statistical Office, a few 
years ago, there were just over 9,000 Russian speakers in 
Finland. The number is rising; the highest unofficial figure is 
about 20,000. It is estimated that some 3,000 of those are 
descendants of Russians who settled in Finland in the last 
century and at the turn of the century, i.e., old Russians. The 
old Russians have integrated well into the majority. Those who 
have arrived from the territory of the former Soviet Union since 
the 1950's are new Russians. The old Russians, who have 
remained quiet, seem to be waking up as a result of the changes 
in Russia and the new Russians. 
  A report by a working group of Russians in Finland was 
completed last spring. The aim is, among other things, to bring 
about the official recognition of the Russian-speaking minority 
and to set up a representative body like the consultative 
committees on Lapp and Romany affairs. The report has been sent 
to many ministries. 
  Minority languages are gaining recognition in the reform of 
civil rights in the Constitution that is currently being 
discussed in parliament. In addition to the national languages 
of Finnish and Swedish, under the government's proposal, the 
paragraph on language rights will also include the indigenous 
Lapp people and the Romanies, who have lived in Finland for 
hundreds of years. The explanatory memorandum on the paragraph 
mentions the Jews and Tatars as other minority groups that have 
been resident in Finland for a long time. During the course of 
drafting the law, Somali refugees came up, but there was no talk 
of the Russian speakers. [passage omitted] 
  Eugen Novitsky, member of the working group of Russians in 
Finland, says this about the explanations for the language 
rights paragraph. 
  [Begin Novitsky recording] Naturally, this matter has its 
own historic background. We must note today that, if and when 
we regard the Swedish language as a national language, then the 
first foreign language today is the Russian language -- if we 
count the population that uses or would like to use and preserve 
that language. For this reason, the working group thinks that, 
after studies, official and stronger recognition, as well as a 
position, should be accorded to the Russian language in our 
country. [end recording] 
  [Leisti] Novitsky says that a meeting will be convened next 
month to set up a representative body to champion the rights of 
the Russian-speakers as a citizens' organization. 
  There is no internationally binding definition of 
minorities. 
There is an agreement between Finland and Russia under which 
Finland must protect languages of the Russian language group and 
Russia must protect Finno-Ugric languages on their territories.

<F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Iceland Fearful of Isolation"] </F>
  [Text] Reykjavik -- Icelandic Foreign Minister Jon Baldvin 
Hannibalsson fears that the Icelanders will be mere spectators 
of the process of European integration after the possible future 
admission of the four EFTA [European Free Trade Association] 
countries -- Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria -- into the EU 
[European Union]. However, he takes the view that as long as 
the EU's fisheries policy remains unchanged, Iceland should 
remain firm on its decision to stay outside the EU. 
  The political reactions in Iceland to the membership 
agreements are characterized in part by fears of growing 
isolation, but several politicians are also stressing that 
Iceland as a small island nation with an 80-percent dependency 
on fishing can best satisfy its special interests through 
bilateral agreements. Foreign Minister Hannibalsson wants thus 
to strengthen Iceland's position in relation to the EEA 
[European Economic Area] and the Common Market through a free 
trade agreement with the United States. 
  Bjorn Bjarnason, chairman of the Althing Foreign Affairs 
Committee, said that the enlargement of the EU will not lead to 
immediate changes to Iceland's foreign policy. 
  "The EEA agreement fully meets Iceland's need for access to 
the European market. On the other hand, Iceland will not of 
course have the same potential to influence the decisionmaking 
processes in the EU as the other EFTA countries. The Icelanders 
will therefore be obliged to revise their attitude to possible 
future EU membership the next time the doors are opened, but 
this will not happen for some years," Bjarnason said.

  [Text] Both the yes and no groupings have strengthened 
their positions after Sweden's agreement with the EU [European 
Union] was completed at the beginning of the week, according to 
a poll by SIFO [Swedish Institute for Public Opinion Polls] 
published in GOTEBORGS-POSTEN. The group opposing Swedish 
membership is still clearly the largest, and it increased by 2 
percent to 42 percent. The yes grouping increased by 3 percent 
to 35 percent. The number of undecided voters fell, 
consequently, and now totals 23 percent. 
  According to SIFO, different groups of voters have reacted 
very differently to the negotiation result. Upper-middle-age 
men are very satisfied, while younger voters have instead become 
more negative toward Swedish membership in the EU.

  [Excerpt] The U.S. State Department conveyed through Robert 
Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on the 
Cyprus issue, that the U.S. Government would not favor Russia's 
active involvement in the Cyprus issue. 
  According to information from diplomatic circles in 
Washington, the United States supports Russia's coordination 
role through the United Nations. This development came to light 
following Lamb's recent visit to Moscow. 
  The State Department coordinator and Assistant Secretary of 
State Steven Oxman will visit Athens and Ankara next week in an 
effort to secure assurances that the two governments will fully 
support the efforts of the UN envoys for progress in the 
proximity talks. 
  Their visit to Ankara is particularly important because it 
will aim at strengthening Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller 
and her party in light of the election on 27 March. 
  It is well known that the U.S. Government is concerned about 
the possibility of the Turkish prime minister's influence 
weakening, which would seriously affect Cyprus and Greek-Turkish 
relations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by P. Kharalambous] </F>
  [Text] When the proximity talks resume next week, UN envoys 
Gustave Feissel and John Paul Kavanagh, will submit ideas in the 
form of nonpapers [previous word in English] to help the two 
sides come closer. 
  According to ALITHIA's information, this is how the UN plans 
to proceed in the discussion of the confidence-building 
measures. This is the same process that was followed in the 
1984 New York talks between President Spiros Kiprianou and 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas that led to the 1985 summit 
agreements. 
  After meeting Denktas and President Glavkos Kliridhis, 
Feissel and Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis yesterday 
confirmed that the ideas will be submitted next Monday [7 March]. 
  In a statement at the Presidential Palace and in occupied 
Nicosia, Feissel gave identical answers to reporters' questions. 
The basic points were: 

  -  There is no deadlock. 
  -  So far talks 
have been useful to the future course. 
  -  Material has been given 
to help prepare proposals. 
  -  There have been no results. 
  -  An 
agreement will hopefully be reached during the next two months 
of talks. 
  Feissel said that the ideas that will help the two sides 
converge on disputed issues will be prepared by Monday, when the 
talks resume. 
  According to exclusive information, Feissel said the issues 
on which the United Nations will make significant suggestions in 
an effort to bridge the differences concern the timeframe for 
action on Famagusta and access to it. 
  Feissel said: "I hope the ideas will prove to be useful. We 
are proceeding according to the timetable, and I don't know what 
will happen in two weeks. I am neither optimistic nor 
pessimistic. I believe an agreement will be reached on the 
confidence-building measures within two months." 
  Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas yesterday avoided 
answering reporters' questions. Kasoulidhis said the two sides 
have finished expressing their views and confirmed that the 
United Nations will now prepare its suggestions. He said we are 
at the same point we were at last Friday, adding that the talks 
will not go beyond March. 
  Concluding, Kasoulidhis said he cannot say that the outcome 
of the talks is disappointing.

<F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>
  [Excerpts] The UN envoys gave indications to President 
Glavkos Kliridhis that views may be converging on at least two 
of the serious issues on the agenda of the proximity talks: safe 
access to Famagusta's fenced-off area and Turkish Cypriot access 
to Nicosia Airport. 
  Relevant O FILELEVTHEROS information is that at their latest 
meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus, and UN Political Adviser John Paul 
Kavanagh got the impression that there will be progress on some 
issues. The UN envoys conveyed their beliefs to the Cypriot 
president. The Greek Cypriot side hopes that Feissel's "ideas," 
which will be submitted next Monday [7 March], will raise the 
prospects for progress toward implementing the measures without 
deviating from the UN secretary general's principles. According 
to the Greek Cypriot side, the most important principle is to 
open the way for a swift settlement of the Cyprus problem. 
  O FILELEVTHEROS' information mentions that the United 
Nations 
shares the Greek Cypriot view that Varosha should not be 
enclaved by the Turkish troops and that there should be free 
access by land and sea. The United Nations will control 
Varosha's offshore waters up to the buffer zone. 
  With the help of three of the four UN advisers that are 
already in Nicosia, Feissel and Kavanagh are feverishly 
preparing their proposals. They are also negotiating with the 
diplomatic representatives of the UN Security Council permanent 
members. [passage omitted] 
  The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent at the 
United Nations reports that Britain is moving to get the 
Security Council to approve a resolution, while the United 
States prefers for the Security Council president to make a 
statement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Glavkos Kliridhis by </F>
Andreas Kaouris in the Presidential Office on 28 February] 
  [Text] [Kaouris] Are there any signs of a change in the 
Turkish stance? 
  [Kliridhis] Right now, we have given the UN secretary 
general's representative our views on two basic issues: 
  Safe access to the fenced-off part of Famagusta, along with 
which we also include the issue of the security of the 
fenced-off part under UN control. We cannot build by day, while 
they go in and steal by night. There are two issues: Safe 
access and the security of the fenced-off area. We believe the 
United Nations should have responsibility for both and that 
there should be access through an area under UN control. 
  We have also given our views on the second issue of the 
timetable the secretary general wants. We have adopted the 
clear position that if we reach an agreement, as soon as we sign 
it the entire fenced-off area of Famagusta should be turned over 
to the United Nations and placed in UN custody. According to 
the agreement [on accepting the confidence-building measures], 
residents should begin to return within two months in order to 
proceed with repairs and so on. 
  These are our positions. I do not know what the Turkish 
side's positions are, but if they are positive I would know 
about it. So they have positions that are different from ours. 
  [Kaouris] Do you see the picture becoming clear in the next 
two to three weeks and things going somewhere with either 
positive or negative results? 
  [Kliridhis] As far as I know, the secretary general will now 
prepare a report, which, as both sides have been told, will be 
preliminary. In three weeks, he will submit another report that 
will clarify things. Don't forget that the time limit is two 
months. In three weeks, the new report should say whether views 
have converged on the points that he has stressed are 
substantive for the implementation of the confidence-building 
measures. 
  [Kaouris] Why do you think Rauf Denktas does not accept 
these 
measures? The Turkish Cypriots have much to gain from them. 
  [Kliridhis] I believe the Turkish side--and this was crystal 
clear--regarded these measures as much more in our favor because 
they return the entire fenced-off part of Famagusta, which means 
all the municipal boundaries of Famagusta. Denktas does not 
seem as interested as we might think in operating the airport; 
he does not know what airlines will use it. The airlines will 
use it if there is traffic. 
  [Kaouris] When we discuss access, do we mean a road, a big 
area, or merely the road that would have led to Famagusta? 
  [Kliridhis] We mean an area that will include a road and 
will 
be under UN control. 
  [Kaouris] Would it have some guardposts through which we 
would cross? 
  [Kliridhis] Yes. 
  [Kaouris] Does the international element, particularly the 
Americans and the British, play some positive role at this phase 
and do you see at least some indications that its efforts are 
turned toward Turkey? 
  [Kliridhis] We should first define the UN role. There is no 
doubt that referring to the United Nations I mean the permanent 
Security Council members. There is unanimity among the 
permanent members on the confidence-building measures, and they 
are watching closely to establish which side is trying to 
torpedo their implementation. The latest joint move by the 
Americans and Russians stresses this thing -- that is, that the 
United Nations, or, if you like, at least these two permanent 
members of the Security Council will work to realize the 
confidence-building measures. But other permanent members also 
support the confidence-building measures and warn that it would 
benefit no one to reject them. I am telling you what the 
permanent Security Council members say. Consequently, the 
confidence-building measures enjoy the support of the permanent 
Security Council members. 
  [Kaouris] Has the Russian element intervened actively 
recently? Lamb [U.S. State Department special coordinator on 
the Cyprus issue] gets a call to go to Moscow. How do we 
interpret that? 
  [Kliridhis] It seems that for some time, Russia left the 
initiative on international issues completely to the U.S. 
element. But now it appears that we are entering a new period in 
which, with regard to particular areas, Russia has decided to 
return to the position of the big power that should be playing a 
role. We saw this in Serbia. The Russian intervention had two 
interpretations: 
  First, it appeared that a NATO military action in Serbia 
could jeopardize U.S.-Russian relations, and it seems that this 
was considered quite seriously. Russia pointed out that it had 
both a say and influence in that area and intervened in the 
direction of the Serbs so that in return, a peacekeeping force 
of 400 men would be dispatched from Russia to remove the heavy 
weapons. You can see that it was the first cease-fire agreement 
that was kept; none of the others were kept. You cannot say 
that this wasn't due to the Russian intervention. 
  Second, the U.S. coordinator left Washington for Moscow to 
be 
briefed and to align his policy. This is very important. Why 
should the U.S. official visit Moscow? It is also very 
important for another reason: All those who were dealing with 
the Cyprus issue earlier, Nelson Ledsky and the others, made 
stopovers. If they were coming from the United States, they 
stopped in London and had talks with the British Government 
before going to Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. This time, there 
was no visit to Cyprus. He did not leave Moscow and go to 
Ankara, Athens, and Nicosia. His trip was Washington, Moscow, 
and back. The question being raised is: Whose idea was this 
visit? Was it a thought by the Americans to meet and coordinate 
with the Russians, or was it Russia's demand to which the 
Americans responded? This is the first time we have seen the 
man who is entrusted with coordinating the Cyprus issue go in 
another direction and make a joint decision instead of doing the 
customary triangle. The United States appears to be realizing 
that for particular problems to be solved, it should cooperate 
with Russia. 
  [Kaouris] The foreign news agencies reported that Lamb was 
invited by Moscow... [ellipses as published] 
  [Kliridhis] He responded. Don't forget that some time in the 
past, when the Russians began demanding a say, the Americans 
refused completely. There is a big difference now. Whether or 
not the Russians asked for this--they might have asked for 
it--it is now proven that Russia says there are particular areas 
in which my own involvement is also needed to solve the problems.

<F P=106> [Report by Michele Kambas] </F>
  [Text] A Limassol car bomb yesterday blasted two vehicles 
and blew in the windows of a house. 
  But the early morning bomb injured no-one. 
  It exploded under the car of Andreas Kharalambous who had 
parked outside his home. 
  The home-made dynamite bomb extensively damaged 
Kharalambous' 
Metro and his daughter's car which was parked nearby. 
  The windows of his house were also smashed in the explosion 
which could be heard all over Limassol. 
  Kharalambous is chief health inspector for the Limassol 
municipality. 
  He had no idea who was responsible for the attack, adding 
that he had no differences with anyone and had never been 
threatened. 
  But police spokesman Andreas Kariolaimos said officers were 
investigating whether the attack could have been due to 
professional differences. 
  Other police sources said suspicions are aimed at one 
specific person working with Kharalambous. 
  Attempts to secure an arrest warrant against the suspect 
have 
failed, said the source, due to insufficient evidence.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and EU 
[European Union] Commissioner on Foreign Affairs Hans van den 
Broek will have a series of discussions on the issue of Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] during their 
current joint tour of the Middle East. 
  These discussions will take place based on Wednesday's [2 
March] instruction from the EU commission to Van den Broek to 
continue his efforts to solve the dispute between Athens and 
Skopje. 
  The Greek Government spokesman described the EU's stance as 
"undoubtedly positive," and added that the Commission's stance 
gives weight to the political aspects of the issue, something 
the Greek Government has insisted on since the beginning. 
  However, a problem appeared yesterday in Prague during a 
high 
level CSCE meeting on the Skopje issue. 
  According to reports, the U.S. delegation, seconded by 
Britain and Turkey, insisted on describing the Greek measures 
against Skopje as a violation of human rights. In this way, 
they are seeking to invalidate the Greek veto of Skopje's CSCE 
membership. 
  As is known, the Greek Government has already made its 
intentions to retract the CSCE veto, provided Skopje meets the 
three Greek conditions for a resumption of the dialogue.

  [Text] With the conviction that the measures against Skopje 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] have brought 
results, at the practical as well as the diplomatic level, 
Greece awaits the Geneva meeting between Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias and UN Special Envoy Cyrus Vance. In an 
interview with ET-1, Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou 
repeated that Greece wants dialogue, not concessions. 
  [Begin recording] [Papandreou] For two years now, the 
international community did not deal with this issue as a 
serious problem, and there was a de facto acceptance of things 
that affected Greece and international law. There was an 
offensive propaganda, a big idealism by Skopje that 
unfortunately caused instability in the region. Today, with 
this movement we hope that a solution can be found. One cannot 
be too optimistic. It is a difficult problem, but we see that, 
through the initiatives of the European Union and the United 
States, a mediation process and a real approach to the problem 
has began. We therefore hope that these efforts will bear fruit 
so the two countries will be able to live peacefully together. 
  [Correspondent Fivos Karzis] Papandreou stressed that 
adopting Greek measures against Skopje has led to a clear change 
in the international diplomatic climate. 
  [Papandreou] There is substantial inaction by the 
international community on the Skopje issue. The problems 
raised by Greece regarding the symbols, name, constitution, and 
borders--that is, issues that actually have to do with the 
meaning of so-called greater Macedonia--are types of 
expansionism by this state against Greece. These Greek measures 
have succeeded in getting the international community to 
intervene and begin a discussion of these problems. In the end, 
these discussions should not legitimize the issues that are 
against Greece. 
  [Karzis] The deputy foreign minister believes the attacks 
against Greece in the European press will ultimately be proven 
groundless. 
  [Papandreou] I think the attacks against Greece during the 
last few days were particularly unfair and unacceptable, 
especially since it is the country that has been presiding over 
the European Union with particular success these days, during a 
very difficult and important case--the expansion of the Union.

<F P=106> [Report by Gr. Roumbanis] </F>
  [Excerpt] Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros 
Pangalos yesterday described the Ankara regime as "far worse 
than a dictatorship." He also said that Turkey was never a 
state of justice, and in some cases imitates and exceeds 
Hitler's policies. 
  Speaking at the presentation of a book about the Greeks of 
Istanbul by Alexandros Alavanos, Coalition of the Left and 
Progress deputy, the Greek alternate foreign minister launched 
an all-out attack against Turkey for its violation of human 
rights and its expansionist policy, for which Cyprus is now 
paying in the most tragic way. 
  At the beginning, both the Greek alternate foreign minister 
and the author referred to the history of the famous 1964 secret 
decree, with which the Ankara government prohibits the Greeks 
living in Istanbul from transferring their properties and 
confiscates the property. 
  In 1980, another law was added to that decree, prohibiting 
the execution of wills for the Greeks living in Istanbul. Both 
men stressed that even though these decrees are contrary to the 
association agreement between the European Union and Turkey, 
they are still in effect. They said the issue will now be 
brought to the attention of the European Union. 
  Pangalos noted that the 1964 decree was inspired by a 
similar 
decree Hitler issued in 1935 that was used to confiscate 
property belonging to Jews. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stavros Liyeros: "Blockade and Dialogue"] </F>
  [Text] The diplomatic tug of war concerning the Greek 
countermeasures against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] is in full swing, and the exact extent of 
western pressure on Athens is not completely clear. At the 
tactical level, this political battle will be judged by the 
government's resistance to western pressures, which is related 
to its ability to handle and blunt them. At the strategic 
level, though, the political battle will be judged by 
Papandreou's political ability to maneuver so as to capitalize 
on the negotiating advantage that has been gained with the 
implementation of the countermeasures, in order to get the best 
possible--and, above all, comprehensive and final--solution to 
the problem. 
  As is known, Athens has made lifting the blockade and 
resuming the dialogue conditional on Skopje's concessions on the 
issues of their flag, constitution, and propaganda. The 
negotiations over the name must result in erasing the term 
"Macedonia." That is why some government circles have made it 
clear that they would prefer an endless dialogue, with the Greek 
side insisting that "neither the term Macedonia nor its 
derivatives" are acceptable. But this short-sighted policy is 
tantamount to a "de facto" acceptance of the current name since, 
despite our nonrecognition, bilateral relations would be 
normalized. 
  Athens has every reason to seek a package solution, and 
[FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov wants this too. Greece could 
accept a resumption of the dialogue, even if Skopje does not 
give in to its conditions, but with the strict condition that 
the blockade will continue undiminished. In this way, the 
countermeasures will work as a strong lever, not only on the 
secondary issues (the flag and constitution), but also for the 
main bone of contention--Greece's demand that Skopje change its 
name. 
  Furthermore, this maneuver would present Greece in a 
conciliatory light and ease the pressure on it, since the 
international community has a tendency to pressure for talks 
without preconditions. The dilemma will be Gligorov's, who will 
either persist in his position of refusing to negotiate before 
the lifting of the blockade or will negotiate under the pressure 
of the blockade. In both cases, the Greek side will have the 
advantage.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 4 (A.A.) -- President Suleyman Demirel 
sent a letter to French President Francois Mitterrand, saying 
that the objective of terror in Turkey was to divide the country 
and that like in other countries this was a grave crime in 
Turkey. 
  In his reply to the French president on Feb. 21, Demirel 
said 
that the judicial authorities will reach a conclusion on certain 
claims and proofs against certain deputies and that a legal 
process was in place, rather than an arbitrary one. 
  Demirel stressed that judgement in Turkey was independent 
and 
the right to defend oneself was limitless. 
  In his letter of Feb. 1, Mitterrand told Demirel that his 
government did not support the idea of an independent Kurdish 
state and had expressed some concerns on the removal of the 
immunity of some deputies. 
  Six members of the Democracy Party (DEP), one former DEP 
member and one fundementalist deputy were stripped from their 
immunity by parliament and were taken into custody today. 
  The DEP, with deputies from the southeast drew public 
reaction as they seemed to support the killing of innocent 
people by a separatist terrorist organization. 
  The organization is responsible of the death of more than 
10,800 people in Turkey in the last 10 years when it launched a 
bloody campaign against the Turkish state and its people. 
  Hasan Mezarci, then member of the fundamentalist Prosperity 
Party (RP), drew public anger and reaction when he led a group 
of 11 deputies in a motion to posthumously restore the honor of 
a group of anti-Kemalists who plotted to assassinate Mustafa 
Kemal Ataturk 70 years ago. 
  The motion sparked anger and prompted a pro-Kemalist rally 
led by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller Monday. Public anger reached 
a fever pitch after Mezarci made defamatory remarks about 
Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.

Mentese said on Saturday [5 March] that coalition government was 
resolved to eradicate the outlawed separatist terrorist 
organization. 
  Mentese visited Anadolu Ajansi office in southeastern 
Diyarbakir Province. 
  During the visit he said lifting the immunity of the 
Democracy Party [DEP] deputies was a judicial thing. 
  Mentese said the government did its utmost for the region, 
however that separatist terrorist organization tried to hamper 
the development activities. 
  Recalling the DEP Deputy Leyla Zana's words that lifting the 
immunities would cause more bloodshed in the region, Mentese 
said DEP and the separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization were one inside the other.

  [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic 
Populist Party [SDPP], state minister, and deputy prime 
minister, has declared that he is against lifting the immunity 
of deputies in principle and for political reasons. Addressing 
the SDPP Central Executive Council meeting today, Karayalcin 
said: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] The SDPP believes that with 
regard to this critical issue, it will be more appropriate to 
pursue policies in accordance with future outcome and expected 
success rates, especially in the struggle against terrorism, 
rather than in line with momentary reactions or rages expressed 
in the society. [end recording] 
  Karayalcin noted that there is no assembly group decision on 
this matter, and SDPP deputies will decide in accordance with 
their free will, after having studied the relevant files. 
Responding to the Motherland Party leader's criticism 
concerning the struggle against terrorism, Karayalcin explained 
that his party is determined to support every possible 
initiative and measure in this regard. We cannot, however, 
accept or condone a struggle against thought under the banner of 
fighting terrorism, Karayalcin remarked. 
  Karayalcin explained that in the past 10 years of separatist 
terrorist activity, 10,000 terrorists have either been killed or 
captured and 3,500 of these were caught in the past six months. 
Pointing out that the government attained this successful point 
in the struggle against terrorism before the actual enactment of 
the amendments in the antiterrorism law, Karayalcin expounded 
with regard to Article 8,which outlines the range of terrorist 
crimes, as follows: 
  [Begin Karayalcin recording] For one thing, we do not in 
principle approve Article 8. Moreover, if Article 8 is to be 
amended, we would like the protection of the secular republic to 
be appended to this article. My dear colleagues, recent events 
have demonstrated our society's sensitivity to this subject. I 
would like to state very clearly once again that it is not 
important where terrorism stems from. The struggle against 
terrorism aimed at secession, at establishing an antisecular 
regime, or at eliminating democracy should be waged equally at 
one and the same time. They should not be categorized. [end 
recording] 
  Karayalcin averred that both his party and the government 
will continue their efforts to guarantee secure elections.

  [Excerpt] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has 
said that developments following the lifting of the immunity for 
certain deputies are contrary to the laws. 
  Addressing an open air meeting organized by his party in 
Kirikkale, Erbakan said the developments are a result of the 
government's bad administration. He said: 
  [Begin Kirikkale recording] A deputy has the right to appeal 
to the Constitutional Court regarding his immunity. A deputy 
might appeal and the court might revoke the decision. If the 
court endorses the decision, then it is issued in the OFFICIAL 
GAZETTE. Only then can the decision on lifting the immunity be 
implemented. These are the requisites of a state of law. [end

  [Excerpt] State Minister Yildirim Aktuna has said it is 
incomprehensible that the Western countries that have not 
reacted to the massacre of innocent human beings, including 
women and children, in the east and the southeast, are now 
concerned about human rights. 
  Aktuna replied to correspondents' questions during a visit 
to 
the Trabzon Governor's Office. Answering a question on whether 
any action will be taken in connection with those who arrived 
from France in support of the Democracy Party deputies, Aktuna 
said: One cannot tell them not to come; one cannot tell them 
they cannot enter Turkey. One should be tolerant within a 
democracy. There is, however, a limit to tolerance. One cannot 
tolerate a stand directed against the independence of the 
country. Aktuna recalled in particular that France and Danielle 
Mitterrand remained silent while the most fundamental human 
right, namely the right to life, was being violated and while 
people were being taken from the mosques and massacred. Aktuna 
added: They should have sent representatives to investigate the 
incidents of terror. He noted that those who refer to the 
noncommissioned officers who were killed in the Tuzla bombing 
incident as military targets, those who issue statements 
supporting the terror organization instead of opposing it, and 
those who dare to insult Ataturk have exceeded the limits. 
Pointing out that recent statements have gone beyond the limits 
of the freedom of speech and belief, Aktuna added that no 
democrat can accept this. [passage omitted]

  [Text] With the approaching local elections, the 
colonialist Turkish regime has infinitely escalated its violent 
genocidal and oppressive actions. Our people cannot have the 
opportunity to express their free will in the elections in such 
an atmosphere of violence. We will not permit elections to be 
held in an atmosphere of genocide, intimidation, and special 
warfare measures put into effect by the colonialist regime. 
  Yes, dear listeners, in a statement issued on 1 March, our 
PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] announced its policy on elections 
[words indistinct] in a statement on behalf of our party, Kani 
Yilmaz, ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] 
representative in Europe, said that we do not regard the 
elections to be held in Kurdistan as legal, and for this reason 
we are boycotting the elections. Therefore, in our view, the 
DEP [Democracy Party] decision is the one preferred by the 
Kurdish people. It is a correct decision that must be 
supported. Had there been democratic conditions, the will of 
the people in Kurdistan would have been revealed. Our leader 
stated this fact many times. To prevent the expression of the 
people's will, the Turkish state is using its army and its crime 
syndicate, the counterguerrilla [words indistinct] as long as 
the war continues in Kurdistan, we will take a clear stand 
against an election to be held outside the will of the Kurdish 
people. We will not accept these elections. Our people will 
definitely not go to these elections. I am particularly 
stressing: The candidates from the other parties must 
immediately withdraw from the elections. I repeat: They must 
immediately withdraw from the elections. If they do not 
withdraw, as of today they are ARGK [People's Liberation Army of 
Kurdistan] targets and will be shot dead. The fascist Turkish 
state is detaining and (?torturing) those persons and candidates 
who do not share its ideology. Those engaged in election 
propaganda are being shot dead, the mayors are being removed 
from their posts, and party headquarters are being bombed. The 
ballot boxes will be opened at military garrisons. These boxes 
are being handed over to the special teams and village guards. 
There cannot be any talk of elections under these conditions. 
This is a complete farce [words indistinct] our ERNK spokesman 
in Europe added: The political parties must immediately 
withdraw their candidates; otherwise, the candidates will be 
punished by our ARGK [words indistinct] he added that at present 
[passage indistinct] Every action to be taken against the 
state's election preparations has been determined. The details 
concerning each action will depend on the assessment to be made 
by regional bureaus of the movement [passage indistinct]

  [Text] State Minister Aykun Dogan has said that the banks 
have sufficient foreign exchange reserves, and that freezing 
citizens' foreign exchange accounts in the banks and converting 
them into Turkish lira is absolutely out of the question. 
  In a written statement, Dogan pointed out that certain 
newspapers recently reported that in the wake of the exchange 
rate readjustments made in January, foreign exchange accounts 
will be frozen and converted into Turkish lira. These reports 
are completely unfounded, Dogan said, adding: The balanced 
value of foreign exchange is determined by the supply and demand 
in the market. There is no need to intervene. There is no 
shortage of foreign exchange in the market. There is no need 
for a transfer of foreign exchange in the banks or in the 
Central Bank. Foreign payments are being made with no delay. 
On the other hand, citizens' foreign exchange accounts are 
totally under the management of private banks. Our banks have 
sufficient supplies of foreign exchange. It is absolutely out 
of the question as well as unnecessary to freeze citizens' 
foreign exchange accounts and convert them into Turkish lira. 
Everything is working securely and in line with economic rules. 
Any statements or commentaries to the contrary are aimed at 
confusing the citizens. 
  Turkey has opted for an open and growing economy. 
Consequently, a return to the policy of bans is out of the 
question. The free market mechanism will determine the areas to 
which savings will be channeled, as has been the case until now. 
Consequently, with the greatest peace of mind, our citizens 
must invest their savings in the way most suitable to their 
economic interests -- as far as terms, interest rates, and other 
conditions are concerned -- including foreign exchange accounts. 
Our citizens must ignore these rumors, which are contray to 
their own interests and to those of the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "GATT: Social Clause Requested by </F>
European Parliament"] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 7 Mar (ANSA) -- The European Parliament 
[EP] has requested the inclusion of a "social clause" in the new 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to be signed in 
Marrakesh this April, it was learned here today. 
  The clause's objective would be to lay down stipulations 
prohibiting forced labour and the employment of minors to be 
contained in the international regulations that govern world 
trade. 
  "In a world in which commercial exchange takes on a global 
dimension and markets no longer have frontiers, commercial 
activity could prove a forceful means of promoting social 
innovation and improving conditions for the weaker sections of 
society in the poorer countries," the European Parliament 
declared in defence of its request.

<F P=106> [Conrad Seidl report: "FPOe Supporters Now Also Mostly in </F>
Favor of EU Membership"] 
  [Text] Linz -- Public opinion regarding Austria's 
membership in the European Union [EU] is still positive: Two 
quick polls after the agreement was finalized last week and the 
"market" poll M37 conducted during the "hot stage of the 
negotiations" show that, at the moment, a majority of Austrians 
would voted "yes." 
  The "market" figures gained during 1,000 personal interviews 
at the end of February show a 44-percent majority for membership 
-- this is 5 percent more than in January and the highest value 
in three years. For the first time in a long period, there is 
the clearest majority among the supporters of the Austrian 
People's Party [OeVP], but also among the Social Democratic 
Party of Austria and the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] voters 
in favor of the European Union dominate. Being in favor of 
membership is in correlation with income and level of education. 
  However, according to "market" figures, opposition has also 
increased slightly (from 34 to 37 percent); the group of 
undecided people, on the other hand, has shrunk. 
  The quick telephone polls by OGM and Integral, which cannot 
really be compared with the above-mentioned poll in terms of 
method, showed majorities between 42 and 56 percent. 
  At the moment, a majority seems to be certain, because 
parallel to the Sunday question [how would you vote if the 
referendum were held next Sunday?], the "market" poll also asked 
whether the Austrians currently see more advantages or 
disadvantages (for months, the group of optimists has had the 
upper hand). In addition, the assessment that the referendum 
will have a positive result dominates with 33 percent compared 
to 27 percent. However, the referendum campaign is not yet over. 
  The determining factor will be which group manages to use 
the 
most convincing arguments. Therefore, DER STANDARD had some 
arguments on membership tested in the M36 poll. 
  By far the strongest argument was taken from a brochure, 
published by the OeVP's Political Academy: A total of 44 
percent identify themselves with the statement "An effective 
environmental policy must comprise all of Europe" -- even among 
opponents of membership, 39 percent agree with this argument. 
  Second and third place are already occupied by critical 
statements from the Greens' brochure on Europe: "The transit 
avalanche is on its way -- Austria will be steamrolled by the 
European Union" appeals to four out of 10 Austrians (and one out 
of three EU advocates); one out of three Austrians believe that 
the European Union could become a "single market for criminals." 
  One out of three are convinced by the "decline of prices to 
the European level" that is promised by the Austrian 
Government's information on Europe; this argument is 
particularly attractive to women. 
  Right at the bottom of the list: The slogan of the Greens 
that EU membership means "open borders for junk food" -- this is 
not believed either by EU opponents or by EU advocates.

<F P=106> [Phillip Johnston report: "Major Sets Up First Select </F>
Committee on Ulster"] 
  [Text] The first select committee on Northern Ireland is 
to be set up to enhance scrutiny of the province at Westminster, 
the Government announced last night. 
  The move was seen as an attempt to placate Unionists 
following their threat earlier this week to boycott cross-border 
talks on the future of Northern Ireland, though the committee 
was promised several months ago. But it angered Ulster's 
nationalists and also threatened a row between the Government 
and Labour over who sits on the parliamentary body. Mr Tony 
Newton, Commons leader, tabled a motion for debate next week 
setting up the committee -- which has long been sought by 
Unionists and was suspected to be at the centre of a deal with 
Mr Major last summer to secure support over Europe. 
  On the same day, the Commons will be asked to give its 
annual 
approval for renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- which 
will again put Labour on the spot as it opposes the legislation. 
  Ever since direct rule was imposed in 1972, Unionists have 
objected to the way Northern Ireland business is handled at 
Westminster without any effective monitoring by MPs. 
  The Government had resisted a select committee for Northern 
Ireland, fearing it would degenerate into a sectarian squabble. 
But ministers have judged the time is now right to establish 
the group to bolster recent efforts to broker a settlement among 
the political parties. 
  Nationalists have long harboured suspicions about a select 
committee, which they see as an attempt to tie Northern Ireland 
closer to the Union and cutting across efforts to win an agreed 
settlement among all the parties. 
  Mr Seamus Mallon deputy leader of the SDLP [Social 
Democratic 
and Labor Party], said in the Commons yesterday that the 
committee was being imposed against the wishes of a substantial 
group of MPs. 
  Ministers, however, do not anticipate any boycott of the 
committee, though they envisage fierce arguments over the 
composition. The Government wants an overall majority, in 
keeping with the convention that select committees should 
reflect the balance of power in the Commons. But with none of 
the main parties represented in Northern Ireland, the issue has 
become complicated. 
  The committee is to have 13 members -- six Conservatives two 
Labour, two Ulster Unionists, one Democratic Unionist, one 
Nationalist SDLP and Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Popular 
Unionist, who could be chairman and would ordinarily vote on the 
Government side. 
  Labour is unhappy with such a balance, arguing that it 
breaches all the rules of select committee composition set down 
since 1979. They also want the chairmanship. A possible 
compromise could be a 15-strong committee, retaining an overall 
Government majority but giving Labour more seats. 
  The Government disputes any suggestion that the select 
committee cuts across the three-strand talks process it is still 
pursuing despite recent setbacks. 
  Earlier this week, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist 
leader, said that he did not see any future in talks involving 
Dublin and that he wanted to concentrate on winning agreement 
for new forms of government in the province. 
  However, he has not broken off contact with the Government 
and further meetings are planned between the Unionists and Mr 
Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister, who is trying to find 
common ground. Realistically, ministers do not expect any 
movement on the talks process until after the European election 
on June 9.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Javier Solana by </F>
unidentified announcer; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Announcer] Let us now talk about the European 
Union, the Europe of the 15, with the agreements already 
concluded with Finland, Sweden, and Austria. The central 
question now is Norway's accession negotiations. Oslo's talks 
with the Twelve will resume tomorrow, and on the table are 
questions on which agreement is difficult, including our 
country's dispute about fishing resources. Good evening, 
Foreign Minister Solana. 
  [Solana] Good evening. How are you? 
  [Announcer] Tomorrow, or rather in a few hours time, you 
will 
be traveling to Brussels precisely for these negotiations. What 
does the enlargement of Europe, of the European Union, mean, and 
above all how will it affect our country? 
  [Solana] Look, basically it means getting a stronger Europe 
from the political point of view: Three countries or four 
countries, if Norway joins in the end, are joining, and they are 
solid countries from the democratic point of view. And also a 
stronger Europe economically, with regard to everything 
concerned with the commercial life of Europe, because the 
countries that are joining are economically prosperous. 
Therefore, we have a greater ability to exert influence in the 
world, politically and economically. And from Spain's viewpoint 
it means opening new markets, and opening new markets basically 
in areas to do with agriculture and fishing, if we achieve what 
I believe we will achieve in the negotiations with Norway, 
namely an increase in our fishing quota, basically cod. 
  [Announcer] Yes, Spanish fishermen are interested in 
recovering that historical right to fish in Norwegian waters, as 
you said, and Spain will therefore, now claim 7,000 tonnes of 
fish as a historical quota -- which it ceased catching in 1981 
when we Spaniards were expelled. Are we going to recover those 
fishing grounds, and what is the Spanish position if Norway 
sticks to its position of not giving in? 
  [Solana] Well, I want to speak very clearly to you, and 
through you to the citizens and fishermen of Spain. We will 
recover not only those 7,000 tonnes of cod that we are asking 
for as a historical right, which we have not had since 1981, but 
I believe that we will also be able to consolidate a further 
3,000 or 4,000 tonnes of cod a year. And I want to say very 
clearly that if we do not achieve this objective or something 
close in the area of fishing we will not be able to celebrate 
Norway's accession to the European Community, the European 
Union. Spain is going to maintain a firm stance on this because 
we believe that it is our right. Our right is that when other 
countries join they too should open their markets. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Solana, let us change the subject and talk 
about former Yugoslavia. Everything seems to indicate that the 
warring parties in former Yugoslavia will have to live together. 
It has also been made clear that the Americans and the Russians 
have made their mark as powers once more. What role is the 
European Union going to play in this conflict, then, and above 
all, what is the Spanish position on sending more Blue Helmets? 
  [Solana] Basically you are asking three things. Firstly, I 
believe, and hope and wish, that the peace process is spreading 
now in the agreements between Croats and Muslims. I believe 
that the understanding on Sarajevo will be a very important step 
for peace, and I believe that it will be possible to give it a 
final form. As you know, there was a fresh UN resolution 
yesterday, even appointing a person to take charge of the 
administration -- not the complete administration yet, but that 
of the collective services of Sarajevo -- to imprint that sense 
of peace. 
  Secondly, as for Russia and the United States, for many 
months the European Community has been asking for Russia and the 
United States to be involved, because it was very important when 
it came to turning to peace -- or to war then, to peace now. 
Russia has a very important role to play with the Serbs and we 
knew that the United States had to play an important role with 
the Bosnian Muslims, who needed the backing of the United States 
in order to turn in the direction that they have just turned. 
  And thirdly, about further Blue Helmets. Spain has made and 
is making a great effort. The normal thing is for us not to 
send any more soldiers because we have already fulfilled our 
obligations, we are fulfilling our obligations very well. But 
if it were necessary, in extremis, I do not think that in any 
case we could send more than what in military terms would be a 
company or thereabouts. But it would be in an extreme case in 
which the need of further forces by General Rose or the United 
Nations were a requirement of great importance. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Center Democrats: Government </F>
Should Work for the Western European Union"] 
  [Text] The next government will have to work for Danish 
membership in the WEU, the Western European Union, during 
1995-96. That is a demand from the Center Democrats [CD] to the 
next government. 
  The CD has already made inroads into the discussion on the 
basis for cooperation in a future [coalition] government. A 
demand from the CD remains that a new government be in favor of 
Danish membership in the WEU. 
  The WEU is a West European cooperative defense organization 
that, following the last NATO summit meeting in December last 
year, became the European component of NATO cooperation. 
  "We are stating clearly that a receptivity must be part of 
the basis for a new government," said Peter Duetoft, the CD's 
policy spokesman. 
  "In the government terms of office to come, each government 
must take a position on Danish membership in the WEU. If they 
say no, then Denmark will become a second-class member of both 
the EU [European Union] and NATO, and in any event we do not 
want that. Our foreign policy footnotes (provisos, editor's 
note) in the 1980's quite simply won't amount to anything 
compared with the footnotes we'll have to adopt if we're out of 
the WEU," Duetoft said. 
  He had no wish to state in which government the CD's wishes 
could be fulfilled or whether it would be easier to convince a 
nonsocialist government on the issue of WEU membership. 
  Duetoft does not support the Liberal Party's proposal -- in 
connection with elections to the European Parliament -- to hold 
a national membership on WEU membership this summer. 
  "That's much too early, because WEU membership requires 
popular enthusiasm. The Liberal Party's proposal will only lead 
to another no vote. I would rather wait until 1995-96 but 
precisely because it would be insane to put together a 
government that is closed to the idea of membership," Duetoft 
said.

  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen, [Culture Minister] Melina 
Merkouri is gone. Her death has touched the whole nation. At 
1545 today, this great Greek woman died at Memorial Hospital in 
New York. What an irony for this great Greek woman to die away 
from the country she loved. Exactly one month ago, she left 
Greece for some scheduled medical exams, saying: I am dressed 
in our blue and white national colors to give me courage, to 
come back again. 
  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said the following upon 
learning of Merkouri's death: Greece today mourns the death of 
Melina. She was a courageous fighter, great performer, and a 
wonderful person. Greece today mourns the death of the woman 
who, with her art and struggles, identified her name with Greece 
itself. All Greeks, who loved her and formed a particular 
relationship with her, are in mourning. It is a relationship 
that will outlast today's tragic moment. As prime minister, 
chairman of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement], and a 
close friend, I bid farewell to Melina Merkouri with real 
sorrow. My wife and I express our sincere condolences to her 
partner Jules Dassin and to her family.

<F P=106> [Donata Riedel commentary: "A Sheriff for Fair Trade?"] </F>
  [Text] The reaction by the German economics minister to 
the new weapon of the U.S. President in the trade war against 
Japan was unequivocal: At last, somebody has the courage to 
show the Japanese that they cannot ruin the poor but honest U.S. 
and European industries with dumping prices in the sphere of 
cars, computers, and chips! Clinton, the hero who fights for 
free and fair trade against Hosokawa, the sinister 
protectionist: "Super 301" is the miracle weapon, the bomb 
designed to safeguard world trade peace, with which the United 
States can control the evil without having to use the weapon. 
This is the most skillful way of selling the world a trade war. 
The U.S. Administration even remained honest and announced that 
the weapon is not explicitly directed against Japan. It is 
aimed at the whole world. Japan's import barriers are only the 
topical cause. 
  In the United States, which made free trade a dogma after 
World War II and defended it worldwide in numerous GATT rounds, 
a tendency toward protectionism began to spread during the most 
recent recession. When Japan's economy was more successful than 
the U.S. competition in numerous areas at the end of the 1980s, 
and when threshold countries were able to offer competitive 
products in the world markets, the Republican U.S. 
Administration started to consider trade to be the government's 
business. Bush traveled with representatives of the ailing U.S. 
automobile industry to Tokyo to ensure a larger market share 
through negotiations. Three weeks ago, Clinton tried to achieve 
the same thing for all future-oriented industries and services 
-- again without success. 
  Unlike in Japan, however, the U.S. Administration was much 
more successful in safeguarding U.S. interests in other parts of 
the world. At the end of the 1980s, the full impact of "Super 
301" was not felt in Japan, but in Brazil and India. Exactly 
one year ago, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor forced 
better access for U.S. telephone producers to the European 
Community. His main argument was that the U.S. market was 
completely open for every competitor -- a simple lie. 
  To fend off unpleasant foreign competitors, the richest 
country in the world created a sophisticated set of rules for 
the fight against price dumping and export subsidies in other 
countries. The U.S. side alone decides what is to be denounced 
as "unfair trade practices." In the case of Japan, Clinton's 
reproach of unfair and discriminatory trade practices is even 
justified. However, if he were really interested in fairness, 
he would chose a different, even if a bit longer path: That of 
the GATT world trade agreement.

Serbs"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel emphasized 
that Russia's participation in the effort to achieve a 
negotiated settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina was decisive. 
Russia's influence on the Serbs in the conflict is of 
considerable importance. Without Moscow's participation there 
will not be a solution, Kinkel said in a short debate in the 
Bundestag on Thursday [3 March]. As a result of the Russian 
efforts, the chances for the reopening of the airport of the 
beleaguered city of Tuzla have increased. The foreign minister 
said that his hope for a peaceful solution has increased since 
NATO's combat mission. Deputy Peter Glotz of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] conceded that the West was 
recently pursuing a serious political approach to solutions.

<F P=106> [Report by "Sto.": "Ruehe: Threat of Violence Came Too </F>
Late"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- Addressing the Bundestag, Defense 
Minister Ruehe, Christian Democratic Union [CDU], said it was 
"indeed a mistake" not to have "used the threat and use of 
military means as an ultimate political argument earlier" in the 
"Yugoslavia" negotiations in Geneva. During a Bundestag 
question session on the government's position on NATO military 
missions -- the session had been called for by the Party of 
Democratic Socialism [PDS] -- Social Democratic Party of Germany 
[SPD] deputies Duve and Glotz gave assurances that a SPD-led 
government would not have acted differently. The PDS, on the 
other hand, said that the participation of German troops in 
AWACS flights was a "clear-cut" violation of the constitution. 
Ruehe said that the shooting down of "Serbian" combat aircraft 
had sent "an unmistakable signal." The war in former Yugoslavia 
painfully shows that even after the end of the Cold War, peace 
cannot be guaranteed on a lasting basis without the possibility 
of employing armed forces when necessary. 
  The Bundeswehr, assured Ruehe, would continue to make its 
contribution to helping people in need. Until now, 874 flights 
had delivered 6,950 tonnes of relief supplies to Sarajevo and, 
in addition, 325 nighttime missions had dropped 1,800 tonnes of 
supplies over eastern Bosnia. Ruehe said he was pleased that 
the SPD had approved of the missions and that in the future, 
there should no longer be any differences between German 
soldiers and their comrades from alliance states. 
  Foreign Minister Kinkel said it was hard when violence could 
only be stopped with violence, but that is reality. If the 
alliance had not been so united, then the Serbs would not have 
moved their heavy weapons away from Sarajevo. The "German 
attitude of restraint has served us well, and we do not want to 
give it up," said Kinkel and, at the same time, demanded a rapid 
clarification of questions pertaining to German constitutional 
law. Like Ruehe, Kinkel said it was inaccurate for the SPD 
chairman to say that there were no differences between the 
government and the SPD on foreign policy. With their latest 
party convention resolutions, Alliance 90/the Greens had 
"completely broken with political reality," said Kinkel. And 
like Defense Minister Ruehe, Kinkel also stressed Russia's 
positive role. 
  Speaking for the SPD, Deputy Duve said that if it had not 
been for the shooting down of the aircraft over Banja Luka, the 
Washington agreement would not, perhaps, have been possible. 
The Vance-Owen plan has finally been put aside, although that 
does not mean that peace has been guaranteed, it has been given 
a new chance. SPD Deputy Glotz said that shooting down alone was 
not enough, the international community finally needs a 
political concept. Deputy Ullmann (Alliance 90/the Greens) 
expressed regret that it had taken a year before NATO had 
enforced the flight ban.

Serbs, Montenegrins, and Kosovo Albanians living in North 
Rhine-Westphalia are evidently to be deported shortly. The 
North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Ministry in Duesseldorf 
confirmed a report in the NEUE RUHR/RHEIN ZEITUNG paper, 
(Saturday's edition), according to which they will be returned 
by aircraft via the Romanian town of Temesvar and thereafter 
proceed by bus to the Serbian border. 
  Those involved numbered "probably a few thousand" refugees 
whose applications for asylum were rejected. People from rump 
Yugoslavia who were living in Germany illegally or who had 
committed criminal offenses were also likely to be deported, the 
report said.

<F P=106> [Report by "C. G.": "Kinkel Meets Kravchanka"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- Foreign Minister Kinkel called on 
Belarus to continue economic and political reforms even after 
the election defeat of President Shushkyevich. At a meeting 
with Belarus Foreign Minister Kravchanka in Bonn on Thursday [3 
March], Kinkel said that Germany possibilities for providing 
Belarus with financial assistance had been exhausted. However, 
the faster privatization and reforms proceed, the easier it will 
be to successfully attract foreign private investment capital to 
Belarus. Kinkel and Kravchanka signed a cultural treaty that 
should facilitate the work of private organizations. A 
"memorandum of understanding" [preceding words in English] was 
signed on promoting cooperation in alleviating the effects of 
the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It should 
eliminate bureaucratic obstacles in dealings between the two 
states and thus assist the work of private German relief 
organizations. Kravchanka said that only 1 percent of the 
territory of Belarus was unaffected by contamination resulting 
from the Chernobyl accident. The effects of the accident have 
caused suffering to 2.4 million Belarussians. 
  Kinkel praised Minsk's compliance with disarmament treaties. 
Like Kinkel, Kravchanka said he was in favor of an unlimited 
extension of the treaty on the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons until 1995. Kravchanka asked for technical and 
financial support for the destruction of tanks in accordance 
with the Vienna CSCE treaty on the scrapping of conventional 
weapons. Belarus must use its own financial resources to 
destroy foreign -- Soviet -- tanks and needs assistance. All 
formerly Soviet tanks that were withdrawn from abroad, including 
those that were stationed in the GDR, were brought to Belarus. 
Almost 2,000 tanks and 150 aircraft had to be destroyed, more 
than in the United States, Great Britain, and France. The 
destruction of missiles in line with START I nuclear disarmament 
is also costly. Kinkel promised that Germany would send experts 
to Russia to check what costs are involved. He could not, 
however, make any financial commitments. Kravchanka said that 
Belarus essentially took a "positive" view of the NATO offer of 
a Partnership for Peace, but had not made any official decision 
so far. Belarus would like to strengthen economic and political 
relations with Germany.

<F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: "The Future of </F>
the Baltic Lies in Europe"] 
  [Text] Declaring the three Baltic republics independent in 
1991 was correcting a historic injustice that had begun with the 
1939 Hitler-Stalin pact. The imperial way of thinking in 
spheres of influence must not happen again. It would destroy 
trust in the possibility of establishing a new type of 
cooperation in Europe. The Baltic was and will be one of the 
areas in Europe that are particularly sensitive to the major 
shifts of our times. 
  Here lies a crucial test for the new principles of peaceful 
coexistence, as laid down in the great CSCE documents of 
Helsinki and Paris. The Baltic will be the touchstone of a 
future European security structure. 
  Germany was among the first countries to resume diplomatic 
relations with the independent Baltic republics. Since then, 
there have been numerous meetings of ministers. Federal 
President von Weizsaecker visited all three countries last year. 
In continuation of this trustful dialogue, I have invited the 
foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to come to Bonn on 
9 March 1994. 
  Together with the Scandinavian countries, Germany has 
various 
historic and cultural links with the Baltic states. Many German 
families have their roots there. Cultural lives in Germany and 
the Baltic are closely related historically. This creates deep 
emotional links. 
  The cities of Riga and Tallinn reflect the tradition, 
cosmopolitan feel, and prosperity of the Hanseatic League. 
Vilnius is characterized by the cultural wealth of the Middle 
Ages. For three centuries, the Hanse linked the merchants in 
the centers at the Baltic and the North Sea; it dominated the 
trade routes and brought about a lively exchange of laws, ways 
of life, and artistic styles. In the Hanse, freedom-seeking 
towns came together under a loose trade alliance. It was an 
early successful model of all-European economic cooperation. 
For centuries international trade routes crossed in the Baltics. 
  Until 1940, economic relations between West Europe and 
Russia 
mainly went via the Baltics. This European region has always 
had the role of mediator. And a number of things indicate that 
this might again be the case in the future. Among all the 
former Soviet Republics, the Baltic states have carried out the 
most impressive reforms. Estonia will probably achieve the best 
economic figures of all the Central and East European states 
this year. 
  For a German, visiting the Baltic states brings on a feeling 
of familiarity. For us Germans, bringing back to life 
long-buried conditions is not only something that is demanded by 
our common sense, but also something close to our hearts. The 
warm reception the German cultural weeks were given in the 
Baltic states last autumn indicates the lively interest we have 
for each other. The Goethe Institute in Riga is a good 
framework for the growing cultural dialogue. The local Euro 
faculty for law, economics, and administration originated from a 
German idea. Partnerships between towns and an intense 
cooperation between the Baltic states and our north German 
laender show that contacts are getting closer on all levels. 
  In the Baltic, traditions from West and East Europe, from 
north and south, meet. The three Baltic republics are, 
therefore, yardsticks for the growing together of our continent 
to form a unity, following decades of forced separation. Every 
political and economic success in the Baltic has effects going 
far beyond the region as such. Without stability in the Baltic, 
there will be no stability in Europe as a whole. 
  The Baltic region is predestined to prove that a 
cosmopolitan 
view and cooperation are far superior to thinking in terms of 
hegemonic spheres of influence. A Baltic region that feels 
secure and gains prosperity quickly will stimulate growth in the 
entire Baltic Sea region. This will also promote a parallel 
development in neighboring Russia. 
  By maintaining close relations with both the Baltic states 
and Russia, Germany will help bring about good-neighborly 
relations, respect, and mutual understanding in the entire 
region. 
  One of the principal tasks is the quick withdrawal of the 
remaining Russian troops that are still stationed in Latvia and 
Estonia. There is no reason to delay this or make it subject to 
other conditions. No package deal can justify leaving one's 
troops on the territory of another sovereign state against its 
express wish. We, therefore, welcome Russia withdrawing its 
troops from Lithuania and indicating its willingness to pull out 
its troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994 -- leaving 
only a small number of soldiers to continue operating the 
Skrunda radar station under a special agreement and for a 
strictly limited period of time. And these deadlines must be 
kept! 
  Minorities should not be made a bone of contention but they 
should be a starting point for a policy of constructive 
neighborly relations and cooperation. Three years ago, the 
majority of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states 
supported independence. Russians, but also Ukrainians, 
Belorussians, and others will have to integrate loyally into the 
new state structures. On the other hand, those of them who want 
to remain living in the Baltic states permanently, must be given 
the opportunity to integrate and be protected against 
discrimination. We welcome the willingness of the Baltic 
republics to include CSCE standards and recommendations by the 
Council of Europe in their laws! 
  The situation of minorities, the withdrawal of troops, and 
the securing of the newly gained independence are particularly 
sensitive points for all those concerned. This sensitivity 
requires a high degree of caution and mutual understanding. It 
includes a willingness not to get stuck with individual issues 
but to make special efforts, if necessary. 
  The problems that arose after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union demand an increase in regional, bilateral cooperation. In 
West Europe we have developed the concept of Euro regions. This 
makes use of the necessity of border areas to cooperate on the 
basis of equality. 
  Germany expressly advocates full European Union [EU] 
membership for the Baltic states, to be achieved via a period of 
association. We want to help these states quickly and generously 
to find their rightful place in Europe. As advocates of the 
Baltic states, we would like to see European agreements 
concluded with them before the end of this year. The EU would 
remain incomplete without the three Baltic states becoming 
members -- just like the other states in Central and East Europe 
with which Europe agreements have been concluded. 
  At the same time, we are using the Baltic Sea Council as an 
instrument of cooperation to keep the peace and create 
prosperity. The Baltic Sea has always been a sea that connects 
states instead of separating them. At the moment, Estonia 
chairs the Baltic Sea Council. A high degree of flexibility, an 
ambitious agenda, and northern pragmatism have led to enormous 
successes for the Baltic Sea Council. Russia's participation in 
this organization emphasizes the country's belonging to Europe. 
  The Partnership for Peace offered by the NATO summit in 
early 
January has been welcomed by all Baltic states. All three 
states are already partners in the Western European Union's 
consultation forum. This way, the security of the Baltic states 
is increasingly linked with the security in the rest of Europe. 
We consider this to be part of an interlocking strategy where 
security will be increasingly based on cooperation. The Baltic 
states in particular need comprehensive security structures that 
are based on transparency and trust. This is why the CSCE has 
an important role to play there. Through its minority envoy and 
long-term missions of observers, it has helped defuse conflicts 
on minority issues in the past. The forum for cooperation in 
security issues offers all countries in that area a framework 
for future security arrangements. 
  The Baltic region has had cultural relations with West 
Europe 
for centuries. These relations must be revived. This revival 
will range from language courses, to students and teacher 
exchange programs, and assistance with joint projects. We have 
to make up for decades of neglect during the time of isolation 
between the blocs. In 1992, German universities had 25 times 
more students from Ethiopia than from the three Baltic states 
together. We must make special efforts to achieve a greater 
balance in the future. I referred to this problem back in early 
February, when I proposed a European education initiative for 
the eastern part of Europe, a "Marshall Plan for the Mind." 
Europe is not just a geographic term, but also a cultural one! 
The future of the Baltic states lies with Europe!

<F P=106> [Martin Winter report: "Remembrance Without German </F>
Diplomats"] 
  [Text] At Chancellor Kohl's wish, German diplomats have 
been forbidden to attend celebrations held in their host 
countries to commemorate "military events during the last few 
months of WWII." To participate in celebrations aimed at "peace 
and reconciliation," the diplomats need individual permits from 
Bonn. 
  The confidential circular, whose existence was confirmed to 
FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU by the Foreign Ministry on Friday [4 
March], mainly concerns the embassies in France and the Benelux 
countries. These countries will hold celebrations in 1994 to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Allied forces' fight 
against the Germans. The major event of this kind will be the 
one commemorating the landing of the Allied forces in Normandy 
on 6 June 1944, which began the liberation of France from the 
German occupiers. 
  The reason behind this ban is that Kohl is annoyed with the 
Allies. According to U.S. and French Government circles, Kohl 
had again tried informally to get an invitation this year as he 
had done 10 years ago on the occasion of the 40-year anniversary 
events. Like 10 years ago, Kohl was told this time that only the 
heads of government of the Allied countries would take part in 
this celebration. Thus, U.S. President Bill Clinton, French 
President Francois Mitterrand, and Queen Elizabeth II will meet 
in Normandy in June. 
  According to the circular, which, coalition circles say, was 
produced at the chancellor's express wish, diplomats are not 
allowed to attend smaller events either. The reason that 
diplomatic circles give for this unusual ban is that many of the 
celebrations are purely military in character, in which one does 
not want to participate. According to diplomats, this circular 
is, however, a distinct change over previous years, when there 
was no strict ban of this kind. 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] considers this 
circular to be a "setback" for relations with these countries. 
SPD Foreign policy spokesman Karsten Voigt said that "the steel 
helmet faction has got its way" in the Foreign Ministry and the 
Chancellor's Office. These people still fail to realize that 
"the German Reich had to take a defeat so that the German people 
could be liberated."

between IG Metall [Industrial Trade Union of Metalworkers] and 
the employers, the German Salaried Employees Union (DAG), too, 
has now reached a wage settlement with the employers' 
association Gesamtmetall. After top-level talks with 
Gesamtmetall this morning in Hannover, DAG called off strikes 
scheduled for Monday [7 March] by its members in the engineering 
wage negotiating region of Lower Saxony, DAG spokesman Ingo 
Schwope said. 
  The negotiating parties, led by Gesamtmetall president 
Hans-Joachim Gottschol and DAG leader Roland Issen, have agreed 
on a 2-percent increase in wages and training grants from 1 
June, as well as settlements aimed at safeguarding jobs. The 
holiday bonus, suspended by the employers, will be reintroduced 
and backdated to 1 January 1994. Special payments such as the 
Christmas bonus will be subject to a one-off reduction of 10 
percent in 1994, it was reported.

<F P=106> [Report by "Stue": "How Can Illegal Arms Exports Be </F>
Prevented?"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 4 Mar -- In the Federal Government's view, 
telephone surveillance by the Customs Criminal Investigation 
Office has proved an efficient tool in preventing illegal 
exports of defense products. The parliamentary state secretary 
in the Economics Ministry, Kolb, said in a Bundestag debate on 
Friday [4 March] that a major German supplier "of a foreign 
country's nuclear program" was detected with the help of 
telephone surveillance. Since October 1992, the Customs Criminal 
Investigation Office has applied for telephone surveillance in 
11 cases. Five cases led to criminal procedures. 
  In an amendment to the Foreign Trade Law, which went through 
its first reading in the Bundestag on Friday, the authorization 
-- limited to 31 December 1994 -- to partially circumvent the 
secrecy of letters and telephone conversations to allow 
persecuting severe offenses against the arms trade and export 
laws, is to be extended by two years. This was criticized by 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] deputy Bachmeier. He 
said that the new regulation would entail permanent telephone 
surveillance being granted to the Customs Criminal Investigation 
Office, which must, however, not be given intelligence service 
authorities. Activities involving the secrecy of postal and 
telephone services should only be carried out by the federal 
prosecutors. In the government's view, the regulation will have 
to be tried out over a longer period of time. 
  Other amendments to the Foreign Trade Law are mainly aiming 
at harmonizing German regulations with European Union [EU] rules 
on the control of dual-use products. They will enable the 
Federal Exports Office to continue granting export licenses 
under future EU regulations. The powers of the authorities 
controlling the observance of the regulations will also be 
extended to comply with European directives. The SPD considers 
this measure a "misleading signal" that does not serve the aim 
of introducing the high German control standards in Europe. 
Kolb said that in the fields of controlling conventional arms, 
services, and know-how transfer, the EU partners would not 
implement the strict German regulations. New EU directives 
would require German regulations to be changed. 
  The draft law also extends the possibility of exchanging 
data 
between the Federal Exports Office and other authorities. So 
far, the office was allowed to pass data to the customs and 
criminal investigation authorities. This is to be extended to 
include the Federal Intelligence Service (BND), the Federal 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), and 
environmental authorities, which has so far only been possible 
in connection with specific export license applications. 
According to the government, the details the Federal Exports 
Office requires from the BND and the BfV are data on foreign 
customers and arms acquisition organizations.

<F P=106> [Article by "hal": "Election Campaign Shapes Economic </F>
Policy Debate in Bundestag"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 3 Mar -- The coalition believes that the 
German economy is gradually recovering. The opposition, on the 
other hand, accuses the government of hindering an upturn 
through omissions and implementing inappropriate measures. That 
was the tenor of a five-hour debate in the Bundestag on economic 
policy and the government's action program for more growth and 
employment. The debate was heavily influenced by election 
campaigning. Despite skeptical statements from economic 
associations and institutes, Economics Minister Rexrodt stressed 
that the government expected the economy to grow by 1.5 percent 
this year. He pointed to the increasing number of orders from 
abroad and "an astounding level of demand in the construction 
sector." In view of the high level of unemployment, the 
economics minister appealed to the parties to collective 
agreements to display restraint in discussing their differences. 
A strike "is the last thing that we need now." 
  The Social Democratic Party of Germany's [SPD] main speaker, 
Saarland's Minister-President Oskar Lafontaine, said that wage 
cuts and wage freezes were completely inappropriate in the 
current economic climate. The result would be a further 
reduction in consumption and higher unemployment. In addition, 
recipients of low incomes would find themselves in an even more 
difficult situation. Pensions will also have to be reduced next 
year. Lafontaine accused the government of failure. In view of 
the weakness of consumption and the low level of investment, the 
Federal Government should not have raised any excise taxes and 
it should support medium-sized business in particular. Instead 
of that, the government canceled the equity capital assistance 
fund in 1991, and now, shortly before the elections, it wants to 
reintroduce it. It has canceled further training for budding 
master craftsmen. By contrast, the SPD wants to reduce 
ancillary wage costs and do more for medium-sized business. 
Lafontaine, like SPD Bundestag Group economics spokesman Jens, 
called on the Bundesbank to further reduce interest rates 
despite the substantial increase in the money supply that was 
recently reported. Jens went on to say that a strike is indeed 
not desirable, but if it does come to that, then it is Rexrodt's 
fault, because he has completely aroused vain hopes. 
  The deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group, Faltlhauser, 
accused Lafontaine of playing "a dishonest game." Speaking in 
the Bundestag, he said that the minister-president of Saarland 
was only opposed to a wage freeze for election campaign reasons, 
while in negotiations on a public sector collective agreement, 
Saarland was supporting employers demands for a wage freeze. 
The CDU/CSU Group's economics spokesman, Haungs, was confident 
that several hundred thousand jobs would be created over the 
next few years. 
  Companies have begun to enter new markets with new products. 
The Federal Government's action program, which Haungs described 
as optimistic, would aid the formation of companies and the 
creation of new jobs, including part-time jobs. The SPD, on the 
other hand, wants to waste billions. Haungs recalled the 
planned "Ecological Modernization" future investment program, 
under which the Social Democrats wanted to spend 10 billion 
German marks within 10 years. In addition, there would be 
additional subsidies for the steel industry, modernization 
loans, and assistance to promote exports. "What the SPD is 
planning is redistribution, not growth," concluded Haungs. 
  Free Democratic Party [FDP] economics spokesman Count 
Lambsdorff took the same line and in addition attacked SPD 
chairman Scharping. Scharping is a "master at not having a 
clear political profile," who says one thing today and something 
different tomorrow. Thus, he promised coal subsidies in Dortmund 
and the abolition of the coal pfennig in Hannover in one 
weekend. "He is like master juggler Rastelli," said Lambsdorff: 
"We are longing to see how many more balls Mr. Scharping will 
produce." The SPD is promising every citizen his own assistance 
program. They extend from research and technology, through the 
restructuring of east German companies and reducing the burden 
on reinvested taxable profits, to a uniform child allowance. 
However, Lambsdorff also criticized the CDU/CSU. It makes one 
think that at its Hamburg convention, the CDU sacrificed the 
"social market economy" trade mark to the mood of the times. 
Referring to Chancellor Kohl, Lambsdorff said that whoever 
maintains that coal, agriculture, and shipbuilding "cannot be 
judged according to free market criteria and even speaks of 
future development in this context is very far away from Ludwig 
Erhard." He criticized CDU/CSU demands for nursing assistance 
insurance paid for by contributions from employers and 
employees, taxes on people without children as well an industry 
policy involving supervision, protectionism, and the formation 
of cartels through a technology council. Lambsdorff also 
rejected Haungs demand that the money currently used for coal 
subsidies should be used for the creation of new jobs. One 
should not set some kind of new subsidy carousel in motion. 
Despite his criticism, Lambsdorff said that the FDP would 
continue to support the CDU/CSU. 
  While Alliance 90/Greens Deputy Schulz called the latest 
government annual economic report "a report produced by the 
blind, deaf, and dumb," the chairman of the Economics Committee, 
Ost (CDU), said he considered the government's assessment to be 
correct. Ost accused the SPD of "having misgivings" about 
everything that is new. He recalled the Social Democrats 
opposition to nuclear energy and the Transrapid train project. 
Ost and Jens then argued about the level of state debt. Ost 
praised the coalition for ensuring that the federal debt had 
only doubled since 1982, while when the SPD was in government, 
the level of federal debt increased -- albeit from a very low 
level -- five-fold.

  [Text] Brussels, March 8 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
threatened here Monday [7 March] to retaliate against alleged 
deficiencies in U.S. tariff-reducing offers in the final days of 
the Uruguay Round of GATT trade talks. 
  EU foreign ministers said in a statement that the Union 
should reduce its tariff offers on items important to the United 
States in retaliation at deficient offers made by Washington. 
  They said the United States had made disappointing offers in 
tariff-cutting schedules that are to be included in the final 
Uruguay Round agreement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade to be signed in Marrakesh on April 15. 
  An EU official, citing U.S. tariffs on trucks and copper, 
said the Union might in retaliation reduce its tariff-cutting 
offer in products such as nonferrous metals. 
  The ministers said such reprisals should target products 
where the United States supplied 90 percent of EU requirements, 
and should be carefully calibrated so that they could not be 
blamed for unravelling the Uruguay Round. 
  The meeting also expressed alarm at last week's decision by 
the United States to reactivate its Super 301 trade regulation 
to force open the Japanese market. 
  The statement said the trade measure would be carefully 
scrutinised to make sure it did not violate EU trade rights. 
  A spokesman for EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan quoted 
him 
as saying that Super 301 was viewed with concern as a unilateral 
trade reprisal that went against the GATT tide of multilateral 
dispute settlement. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe stressed France's demand 
that the effect on trade of environmental, social and monetary 
issues should be spotlighted at the Marrakesh conference, where 
a new World Trade Organisation is to be set up. 
  The French demand aims at preventing countries profiting 
from 
cut-price exports through poor environmental and social 
standards, and monetary manipulation. 
  There was some suport for establishing an environmental 
committee at Marrakesh. "But let's not cloud the Uruguay Round 
with other issues now," Brittan's spokesman said.

  [Text] Brussels, March 7 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
is approaching a major crisis in its row over voting procedures 
if it accepts new members, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros 
Pangalos said here Monday [7 March]. 
  Pangalos, chairman of the EU's Council of Foreign Ministers, 
said they had failed to overcome a dispute over a change in the 
balance of power if Austria, Finland, Sweden and possibly Norway 
are admitted in 1995. 
  The issue is threatening to wreck the chances that the four 
countries will be able to join the Union. 
  Pangalos said he would turn the matter over to EU heads of 
state and government if the foreign ministers failed at another 
attempt to resolve the dispute on Tuesday. 
  Italy on Monday joined Britain and Spain in insisting that 
the entry of the three or four newcomers should not affect the 
ability of a small number of countries to block controversial 
decisions. 
  The Greek minister added that there had been no progress in 
a 
dispute between Norway and Spain which is blocking the 
Norwegians' entry into the Union. 
  Spain is trying to gain catch quotas for Norwegian cod as 
part of the price for Norway's membership of the EU, a price 
which Oslo is steadfastly refusing to pay. 
  The European Union agreed with Austria, Finland and Sweden 
last week on their terms of entry, a decision which will have 
little effect if the enlargement process is torpedoed by the 
voting quarrel.

  [Text] The Nordic prime ministers have promised to continue 
their cooperation even if all the Nordic countries become 
members of the European Union [EU]. The prime ministers are, 
however, allaying the fears of the EU, denying that a Nordic 
bloc is being created within the community. Kimmo Henriksson 
reports from Stockholm on the prime ministers' meeting: 
  [Henriksson] The future of Nordic cooperation in the EU has 
aroused concern at the session of the Nordic Council that has 
opened here in Stockholm, both at the level of parliamentary 
deputies and governments. For instance, the main Swedish paper 
DAGENS NYHETER thought today that the entire Nordic Council 
would become unnecessary following possible EU membership. It 
could concentrate merely on distributing cultural prizes. 
Indeed, the role of the Council has for many years been 
insignificant in sectors other than culture. 
  The Nordic prime ministers, who were also holding their 
meeting here, do, however, give assurances that cooperation will 
continue. Carl Bildt of Sweden pointed to the cooperation 
during the EU membership negotiations and thought that it would 
continue better than ever also during membership. 
  Esko Aho of Finland was of the same opinion, but at the same 
time he reassured the EC, which fears internal blocs, that the 
Nordic countries have no intention to organize themselves within 
the Union as a pressure group of their own. It is a different 
matter how convincing the talking seems at the EU end. As is 
known, the Nordic countries have intergovernmental cooperation 
that has developed more and more in the last few years and where 
the role of host circulates annually from one prime minister to 
the other. Whether this is described as bloc building is one of 
the sensitive matters that will be heaped upon the Nordic 
countries as a result of eventual EU membership. 
  As for Nordic cooperation on the level of parliamentary 
deputies, the prime ministers promise that there will be room 
still for that. For instance, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen of Denmark 
found at least two specific issues in addition to culture on 
which cooperation between parliamentarians could be concentrated 
in the future, namely employment and environmental problems. 
  The Nordic prime ministers again urgently call for the 
withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia. At their 
joint meeting with the Baltic prime ministers in Stockholm, the 
Nordic prime ministers pointed out that Russia has undertaken to 
withdraw its troops by the end of August.

  [Text] Leaders of the Baltic and Nordic countries are 
holding a conference in Stockholm today. Here is Audrius 
Braukyla with more details about it: 
  [Braukyla] Efforts by the Baltic states to become members of 
the European Union were assessed positively by the Nordic 
countries, Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius said. 
  Together with the colleagues from Latvia and Estonia, the 
Lithuanian delegation headed by him held a discussion today with 
the prime ministers of the Nordic states. According to 
Linkevicius, [word indistinct] especially strong political 
support by the Nordic countries to the Baltic states in the 
spheres of security and economic cooperation. 
  The problem of the withdrawal of the Russian troops from 
Latvia and Estonia, which was the main topic of discussion, has 
been reflected in the statement made today by the five Nordic 
states. It stresses, among other things, that it is important 
that the Russian troops were withdrawn by the date that had been 
fixed by Russia itself--that is by 31 August 1994. 
  Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a news 
conference, stated categorically that the withdrawal of the 
troops was the norm of international law and that it should not 
be linked with any other issues. 
  Answering a question regarding what the reaction of the 
Nordic countries, and especially Sweden, would be in case a 
danger to the independence of the Baltic states arose, the head 
of the Swedish Government said that the danger to Lithuania, 
Latvia, and Estonia would also mean the same danger to the 
Nordic countries, as well as a danger to all of Europe. In this 
case, not only the Nordic states would have to react, but also 
the entire international community. 
  However, according to Bildt, it is too early to think about 
direct military assistance by the Nordic states to the Baltic 
countries in the event of aggression. 
  The observers think that cooperation between the Baltic 
states and Nordic countries based on the formula five plus three 
is gaining momentum. According to Latvian Prime Minister Valdis 
Birkavs, the Baltic states are absolutely satisfied at the 
moment with the assistance received from the Nordic states. He 
said that today's meeting was an important stage in the 
implementation of specific projects.

Stockholm.

  [Text] The Nordic countries have again urged the withdrawal 
of Russian troops from the Baltic countries. The Nordic prime 
ministers, meeting in Stockholm, thought it important that the 
Russian soldiers should withdraw from Estonia and Latvia by the 
end of August as Russia has promised. Prime Minister Esko Aho 
stressed that Finland will not offer to act a mediator in the 
dispute, even though Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
will be visiting Finland at the end of the week. According to 
Aho, it is important for Finland, however, to maintain contacts 
with both sides. 
  The prime ministers of the Baltic countries were also in 
Stockholm today. Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar stressed 
that the Russian troops pose no direct military threat to 
Estonia, but the issues concern environmental problems and crime.

  [Text] Half of Greece's prison population is taking drugs, 
officials revealed in Athens yesterday. 
  New ways of fighting the ever-increasing drugs problem were 
discussed at the start of a three-day European Union conference 
on illegal drugs, held at Zappion Hall, Central Athens. 
  The opening day seminar was on drug-addicts and prisons. 
  Addressing representatives from all over Europe, European 
Affairs Minister Theodhoros Pangalos said the production and 
trafficking of hard drugs was an increasingly serious problem 
for Greece's neighbours. Mr. Pangalos joined in wide-spread 
allegations that The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM] produces heroin. 
  "New networks of producing and processing drugs, heroin in 
particular, have developed in some countries that used to have a 
communist regime," he said. "Information is there, easy to be 
proved," he added, pointing at records of arrests that Greek 
authorities have had at their disposal during the last few years. 
  Justice Minister Yeoryios Kouvelakis said that Greek law 
punishes drug traffickers but was unfair in how it treated drug 
addicts. He did not rule out the possibility of a future 
amendment to the law. "The issue of people taking drugs and the 
way of facing them remains open," said Mr. Kouvelakis. 
  According to data presented by Manolis Skoulakis, deputy 
health minister, over half the people detained in Greek prisons 
are on drugs. Mr. Skoulakis said that medical staff will soon 
be hired by all Greek jails in order to tackle the problem: "A 
model unit for the psychological rehabilitation of drug addicts 
will be founded in Khalkidhiki, in the near future." He added 
that "the purpose of the project, costing one billion drachmas, 
will be to face the needs of drug-dependent prisoners," 
stressing that it will function on a voluntary basis.

<F P=106> [Report signed "SN-m.f.": "Iran Wants To Agree on </F>
Rescheduling Debts With Austria"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Iran, which has problems servicing its 
loans because of declining oil prices, is seeking to reschedule 
its debts. Since efforts to do this at the multilateral level 
in the Paris Club of the creditor countries have failed, Iran is 
now trying for bilateral solutions. Austrian claims from 
state-secured export business, which amount to about 12 billion 
schillings, are also affected. Negotiations are to be held in 
March. However, it will not be easy to come to an agreement, 
because Tehran wants to pay its overdue liabilities with oil 
deliveries. 
  Algeria is another country that internationally is 
considered 
as a candidate for rescheduling, because its revenues from 
business in natural gas are suffering under the decline in oil 
prices. So far, Algiers has paid its debts to Austria. In this 
case, liabilities amount to about 14 billion schillings, 9 
billion of which come from a railroad project. 
  There are also problems with Russia (liabilities: about 40 
billion schillings), which has not fulfilled obligations 
incurred in the rescheduling agreement with Austria for paying 
interest. For this reason, in contrast to its original 
intentions, the Control Bank is not issuing any more guarantees 
for exports to Russia for the time being. 
  The situation is similar regarding most other CIS states. 
Only painstakingly chosen projects are insured and financed, 
which should guarantee the servicing of such debts. Business is 
normal only with Kazakhstan and Belarus, which have been granted 
credit lines. The Control Bank was able to slightly loosen 
conditions for insuring exports to Poland (liabilities: about 
40 billion schillings), which is fulfilling its rescheduling 
obligations most punctually. 
  In 1993, the Control Bank's focus shifted toward the 
neighboring reform states and the Southeast Asian countries 
because of premium reform, economic development, and the 
development of risks as well as the release of soft loans. 
  If Austria becomes a member of the European Union [EU], this 
would also have consequences for the Control Bank. It would 
then retreat relatively quickly from short-term business with 
OECD countries for the benefit of private loan insurers, but the 
range of claims that are worth refinancing would be extended by 
the risks insured by these private insurers. EU membership 
would further stimulate business with the neighboring reform 
states because of the elimination of discrimination in the 
processing trade. 
  Last year the Control Bank's turnover in guarantees declined 
to 45.1 (48.2) billion schillings, but promissory notes rose 
clearly to 41.9 (27.5) billion schillings, which raises the 
expectation that business will recover this year. The volume of 
rescheduling loans and guarantees has increased to 87.1 (78.2) 
billion. Payment of damages from liabilities (without 
rescheduling) went down to 3 (4) billion schillings, or to 1.9 
(2.9) billion minus refluxes. 
<H5>  Countries for Half Retention Listed </H5>
  The recent amendment to the Export Promotion Regulation 
(AFVO) stipulates, among other things, a 5-percent limit for 
deliveries to countries whose credit standing has improved. 
Even though a list of such countries is still being drawn up, 
it probably will be more comprehensive than was feared after 
first restrictive comments by the Finance Ministry. 
  According to the latest information, about 15 to 20 
countries 
will probably be on the list. This applies, in particular, to 
Asian as well as the reform states of East and Central Europe 
and a few countries in Latin America and Africa. The final 
decision is to be made over the next few days.

<F P=106> [Report signed "gb": "Austria's Exports to the United </F>
States Rose Again Strongly Last Year"] 
  [Excerpts] New York/Vienna -- Last year Austrian exports 
to the United States rose strongly again. They have increased 
by 20 percent to 15.4 billion schillings. In contrast, U.S. 
exports to Austria rose by only 6.2 percent to 24.8 billion 
schillings in 1993. This resulted in a reduction of Austria's 
deficit in the bilateral trade balance by 1.1 billion schillings 
to 9.4 billion schillings. 
  Benno Koch, Austria's trade delegate in New York, says this 
development is largely due to the changes in the exchange rate. 
As he explained in a discussion with Austrian journalists, the 
strengthening of the dollar made it easier for Austrian 
exporters to get access to the market. About half of the 
increase can be considered to be due to the exchange rate, Koch 
pointed out. 
  Last year Austrian exports also got more strongly involved 
in 
the U.S. market. The recovery of the U.S. economy, while other 
important sales markets stagnated or suffered from recession, 
has made the United States once again a tempting target for 
intensified efforts. 
  For 1993 Koch noted particularly marked export increases in 
the fields of chemical products (plus 27.8 percent), processed 
goods (plus 22.8 percent), as well as machinery and vehicles 
(plus 18 percent). Together, these three fields amounted to 
almost three-quarters of Austria's overall exports to the United 
States. [passage omitted] 
  Last year Austrian direct investments in the United States, 
which had declined by about $100 million to $387 million in 
1992, also seem to have recovered. 
  In total, about 340 Austrian companies currently are 
represented with branch offices in the United States, and 10 to 
15 percent of them have their own production facilities. Focal 
areas are North and South Carolina.

who returned to Vienna on Saturday [5 March] after leading the 
Austrian anti-Temelin delegation to Washington with OECD 
Ambassador Peter Jankowitsch, is convinced that the delegation's 
activities "have fallen on fertile soil" in the United States. 
Heindler expressed the conviction "that the Eximbank cannot

and I believe that the facts speak in our favor -- a lot of 
persuasion in Congress." 
  Heindler does not want to predict whether the U.S. loan 
guarantee for the completion of the Czech nuclear power plant 
can be prevented in the end. However, he is certain that, after 
the Temelin case, there will not be any "repetition" regarding 
the financing of the refurbishing of old Soviet reactors.

<F P=106> [Interview with Erik Derijcke, secretary of state for </F>
development aid, by Didier Grogna; place and date not given: 
"Derijcke: `Alternate Development Cooperation'" -- first five 
paragraphs are L'ECHO introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Erik Derijcke was able to assess in Rwanda the 
full extent of the path which still has to be covered before the 
democratization movements are accompanied by real development in 
the poorest countries. At present, cooperation boils down to 
humanitarian aid in many cases. It is aid for survival, but not 
development aid. 
  In many situations, the problems encountered are also not 
limited to national borders. While accompanying Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes to Kigali, the secretary of state for 
development aid had the opportunity to reaffirm that Belgium is 
the state which grants most aid to Rwanda. In these conditions, 
our country has the right to give a clear message: Things must 
change. 
  For Derijcke, the institutional vacuum prevailing in Rwanda 
as in other countries prevents action worthy of the name. 
"Without an interlocutor, you can give immediate aid to the 
populations but you cannot do anything else," the secretary of 
state explained. 
  With a few weeks to go before the negotiations on the second 
financial section of Lome, Erik Derijcke gave us his impression 
on the state of this convention and the lines which Belgium 
intends to follow in acting in the cooperation sphere. In 
short: Agriculture, education, and health will be the 
spearheads of an approach which is more regional, more 
integrated, and longer term. In addition, the populations, and 
particularly the women, will have to be involved in the plans. 
  For Erik Derijcke, the most difficult thing is to make the 
populations understand the cooperation policy. "We must try to 
bridge the gap between problems and policy," he said as a 
preamble. 
  [Grogna] Does Europe have the means of pursuing an effective 
cooperation policy? 
  [Derijcke] I think that the means exist. The European 
Development Fund (FED) is by far the biggest fund in the world. 
Belgium alone contributes some 3 billion Belgian francs [BFr] to 
it. It is undoubtedly possible to do a great deal with such 
resources. There is also the Center for Industrial Development, 
which provides aid to entrepreneurs wishing to try a venture in 
the ACP [African, Caribbean, and Pacific] countries. But these 
are bodies which are perhaps not working at full stretch. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Grogna] Africa is lagging behind. Is this not the result of 
the policy pursued for 30 years by the former colonists? 
  [Derijcke] Africa's weakness probably stems from responses 
which we have had for 30 years. I admit we made mistakes during 
decolonization which was aimed, primarily, at maintaining the 
advantages of the former colonists. But I reject statements 
that the Africans are our brothers. After 30 years, I think it 
is old-fashioned and pointless. This is a tone of dependence 
which does not encourage the Africans to make efforts for their 
development. 
  In Asia or Latin America, this policy of dependence did not 
exist and the opposition movements developed sooner. Today, 
these parts of the world are reaping the rewards of that. 
  [Grogna] Africa's geographical situation has also had a 
negative impact... 
  [Derijcke] The geopolitical situation was devastating for 
sub-Saharan Africa. The countries were divided into two camps, 
between the West and the East, thus creating greater dependence. 
Then, when the Berlin Wall fell, most of these countries were 
left out. 
  The European countries have always tried to dominate the 
African countries which are now paying the price of our mistakes. 
  To realize this, you just have to look at what is happening 
in the countries in the CFA franc area. That was another form 
of domination. Today, these 13 states are faced with reality 
and are suffering as a result. 
  What Belgium has done in Central Africa was also the result 
of this policy. When cooperation was halted, Zaire was 
receiving BFr3 billion per year, of which 2 billion were for 
Belgian aid workers alone. That was not very sensible when 
hundreds of African students were coming out of our 
universities. It would have been better to help them to use 
their knowledge. 
  In general, neocolonialism has had many negative 
consequences. 
  [Grogna] At present, we should probably compensate and help 
the populations.... 
  [Derijcke] We are trying. But it is very difficult to 
convince a certain African political class to think differently. 
The whole tragedy of Lome lies in the fact that we are talking 
with a political class which rejects change and not with the 
populations. 
  I am convinced that development should call for joint 
responsibility. It must be put back into its cultural context. 
This is the success of Asia where cooperation is entirely 
different because the leaders know what they want. In Africa, 
we have always said what we wanted for them. 
  [Grogna] Do you think that opinion is ready to change in 
Belgium? 
  [Derijcke] I think so. In the Belgian Parliament too, 
because it is composed of a class of deputies who no longer have 
very close ties with the former colonies. But, to ensure that 
the debate on joint responsibility, complementarity, and 
consistency succeeds, the main development bodies must think the 
same thing. 
  It is only when these big multilateral institutions bring 
about a responsible aid policy that we will be able to succeed. 
  I think it would be a complete illusion to think that 
Belgium 
could single-handedly bring about economic recovery in Rwanda, 
or Burundi, or Zaire. We must work in a complementary way. This 
is the most fundamental debate which I tried to introduce at the 
European level during the Belgian presidency. 
  [Grogna] Are the other countries prepared to follow your 
lead? 
  [Derijcke] I have observed a change of thinking. There are 
different strategies within the European Council of Ministers. 
On the one hand there are countries which do not have much of a 
colonial past like Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and 
Belgium -- a group which will be strengthened by the countries 
which will join the Union. This group runs counter to the two 
big powers. Britain tries to sublimate its cooperation policy 
by a nonpolicy. Its recent adventure with the supply of arms to 
Malaysia is significant at this level. Finally, the French have 
great problems. Even for such a powerful country it is 
impossible to try to solve the economic problems in the CFA 
franc area countries single-handedly. The political change in 
the thinking of the French politicians is significant. They are 
obliged to call on their partners. 
  [Grogna] This collaboration probably also would enable 
better 
use to be made of financial resources. 
  [Derijcke] Indeed we do need international cooperation to 
avoid paying for the same problems several times over. Economic 
destabilization and industrial backwardness lead to political 
destabilization. As a result, we have to intervene with 
humanitarian aid, take part in the demobilization of the army, 
and think of cooperation. When that does not succeed, we have 
to intervene with emergency aid. It would be more useful to 
follow the same paths to achieve the same objectives. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Grogna] There is sometimes an impression that Belgium is 
currently moving toward the regions which it knows least well, 
like Southeast Asia, at the expense of Africa. Even if you 
refuse to talk of historical ties, we have expertise in those 
countries. Would it not be more effective to concentrate on them? 
  [Derijcke] Contrary to a widespread idea, Belgium has not 
abandoned Africa. More than 80 percent of our aid is still 
devoted to it. Belgium is the biggest per capita provider of 
aid to Africa. 
  Our presence on the other continents is more limited. In 
Latin America, we devote our attentions to three countries 
(Ecuador, Bolivia, and Suriname) where we are achieving good 
results. In Asia, we have strongly reduced our aid to Indonesia 
and Thailand, but we have started cooperation with countries of 
the future like Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We are also 
resuming cooperation with the Philippines -- a country which is 
making great efforts and which is important for our small- and 
medium-sized enterprises. 
  [Grogna] Is it not a mistake to associate democracy and 
human 
rights with development? The Asian countries are not models of 
democracy and yet they are developing. 
  [Derijcke] I have worked a great deal at the European level 
for the integration of human rights in cooperation policies. I 
attach importance to the problem of respecting human rights. 
However, the problem of democratization is less clear. In my 
view, if there is a desire to improve the existing situation, 
that is important in itself. In Indonesia, we received an 
outright rejection of our human rights policy. 
  [Grogna] Do you think human rights are the key to 
development? 
  [Derijcke] It is impossible to pursue an honorable policy if 
there is not stability and peace. 
  [Grogna] Is Belgium accepted in the community of big nations 
in the cooperation sphere? 
  [Derijcke] Absolutely. Unlike some big states, nobody is 
afraid of Belgium. In addition, we have considerable resources. 
We are in demand everywhere. Our African experience is 
recognized. In Asia, our policy in the sphere of energy, 
health, education...interests many countries. 
  States in which we had no presence are calling on us. Mali, 
Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Togo are asking to cooperate with us. 
In this region, we are working on the basis of integrated 
cooperation. 
  [Grogna] What does that mean? 
  [Derijcke] These are countries which experience the same 
problems. We are trying to help them in the same way. It is 
important to realize that many cannot overcome their problems 
unless they try to solve their problems in cooperation with 
their neighbors. 
  You just have to look at the example of Rwanda and Burundi. 
They are now dependent on international aid. But their future 
probably will depend on integrated development with Uganda, 
Tanzania, and southeastern Zaire. 
  The economic integration of the southern African countries 
(Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi) is a success which should 
lead other regions to consider this solution. 
  [Grogna] We are calmly approaching the negotiation of the 
second financial section of the Lome Convention. What is your 
attitude to these countries? 
  [Derijcke] Three essential points must be highlighted. 
  We will insist on including the reference to human rights in 
Article 5 of the Convention. This is a priority, especially 
because we are stricter in cooperation with non-ACP countries 
than with countries which are members of the Convention. 
  In addition, we want to administer the payments more 
efficiently. We want to help the poorest countries but not 
without results. We will therefore be stricter and will only 
pay when there are real opportunities to use the resources. 
  We must also plan in a more rational way and urge a degree 
of 
economic discipline. We must revitalize the economies, taking 
account also of the GATT results: To help the Africans to 
export in this new world order of trade. That is why we must 
organize basic production more effectively and revive exports. 
The nongovernmental organizations are afraid of this policy, 
fearing that the Africans will be swamped by our imported 
products. Belgium does not intend to end its food aid (to which 
75 percent of our aid is devoted), but we must also prepare 
Africa to take part in world trade. I do not want it to 
continue to be treated as a powerless continent. 
  [Grogna] Do you think that the ACP countries are prepared to 
agree to discuss a reorganization of the convention? 
  [Derijcke] This is probably the biggest problem. However, I 
think we must have discussions to achieve progress. 
Unfortunately, the ACP countries are not asking questions, are 
not making their ideas heard. 
  [Grogna] This probably shows that the political class has 
not 
changed much in recent years. 
  [Derijcke] Indeed. The political class is often isolated, it 
does not even understand the population's needs. Whether you 
like it or not, development toward democratization is necessary. 
This will take time. We know that and we do not want to hurry 
anything. We are just waiting for positive signs, the 
establishment of bases for discussion. We do not want elections 
at any cost in all the countries. Elections are the culmination 
of a long process. We are just asking the countries to start 
the process. 
  [Grogna] Do you believe in the future of the ACP? Is it not 
a term which is now meaningless? 
  [Derijcke] The term comes from the former colonies, but no 
longer means anything. I would like to play down the notion of 
the ACP. The African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries are 
totally different. However, I do not want to call into question 
the Lome Convention in which I firmly believe: It is a superb 
tool which has enormous resources. It must change, while 
safeguarding the idea of it. 
  [Grogna] Aside from human rights, what are the priorities 
for 
ensuring that bilateral cooperation functions well in general? 
  [Derijcke] Our bilateral cooperation stands up well. 
However, I would still like to develop along several lines: 
Fewer countries and better specialization; changing our 
university cooperation (reducing the number of African students 
in our country and investing in quality education in their 
countries to prevent cultural disaffection); imparting new 
dynamism to our aid workers and reducing their presence in a 
single country, where they eventually forget their mission.... 
  [Grogna] Will Belgium have a presence in Zaire? 
  [Derijcke] If a government worthy of the name is installed, 
we will be present. This does not mean we are now no longer 
doing anything. We are virtually the only country giving them 
aid. In 15 months, Belgium has paid out some BFr750 million for 
Zaire. 
  [Grogna] Does the institutional vacuum not present a 
problem? 
  [Derijcke] It presented a problem but the law now enables me 
to work directly with the Higher Council of the Republic.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Lefevre: "The Russians and Americans </F>
Are Readjusting Their Relations -- Moscow Will Join NATO's 
Partnership for Peace"] 
  [Text] Russia will soon join the Partnership for Peace 
[PFP] proposed by NATO, Moscow has just announced. The three 
ambassadors sent to the Russian capital to present this 
initiative judged the Russian reaction to be "very positive." 
This decision, taken after long hesitations, essentially 
indicates that Moscow intends to continue its policy of 
cooperation with Western countries. 
  The announcement of a forthcoming meeting between Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher on 14 March in Vladivostock to "repair" 
Russian-U.S. relations, it is said in Moscow, also points in 
this direction. It is true that since the Clinton-Yeltsin 
summit in mid-January these relations have been subject to 
increasing tensions, creating uncertainties. 
  Strong rivalry has reappeared in East-West relations. In 
Sarajevo then Tuzla, Russia has imposed itself forcefully and 
skillfully without even consulting UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force], as soon as NATO started to act without it. It has also 
opposed any new UN resolutions regarding other Bosnian safe 
areas, and any other threat of using force against the Serbs. 
  In a wider perspective, Russia has refused any enlargement 
of 
NATO toward the East. And when U.S. President Clinton invited 
Rabin and 'Arafat to Washington to try to save the peace process 
after the Hebron massacre, Moscow immediately sent its own 
emissary to Tunis and Jerusalem to see the PLO. Certainly the 
sword of Damocles named nationalism no longer allows the 
occupants in the Kremlin the slightest weakness on the 
international front. 
<H5>  Questions and Doubts </H5>
  On both sides questions are also being asked about the real 
intentions of the other party. In Washington they are wondering 
about the new Russian policies which, from Kozyrev to Yeltsin, 
are reaffirming their pretensions to a sphere of interest beyond 
Russian borders. They are asking what is the new military 
doctrine, which has still not been presented by Moscow. They 
are asking what cooperation can be expected from the Russians, 
not only in Bosnia, but also in the Near East or North Korea. 
  In contrast, in Moscow they are wondering about the reasons 
for Washington giving so much publicity to the arrest of the 
Ames spy couple. This operation was in fact revealed at the 
very moment when Strobe Talbott, the advocate of unrestricted 
cooperation with Russia, was confirmed by Congress for the 
number two position in the State Department. In the United 
States a quiet battle for influence is taking place between new 
doves and new hawks in order to reorient the White House's 
Russian policies. Moscow is entitled to wonder about its 
outcome. 
  Things have suddenly turned cold. Washington has reverted to 
a certain prudence. It has refused President Yeltsin's proposal 
for a summit conference on Bosnia. In the economic field the 
recent meeting of the finance ministers of the G-7 countries 
also indicated that there would not be any major new financial 
aid for Russia without an effective revival of the reforms, 
which looks very improbable today. In turn, worried by NATO 
going it alone in Bosnia, Russia fears isolation and exclusion 
from the debate on security in Europe, and the loss of its 
status as a European great power. 
  Nevertheless in recent days the two partners have 
rediscovered the language of moderation and are seeking to show 
consideration for their respective sensitivities. Russia will 
join the PFP, but on special terms respectful of its great power 
status. Moscow has approved the attack against Serb planes 
which were violating the Bosnian no-fly zone, but in turn NATO 
has been careful to not identify the origin of this provocation 
too closely, just as it has carefully avoided any attacks in the 
demilitarized, highly sensitive zone around Sarajevo. Between 
questions and concerns, rivalry and cooperation, the Russians 
and Americans can still find ground for agreement, it seems.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Jean Berhin, Army chief of staff, by </F>
Olivier Alsteens; place and date not given: "Army: Social 
Factors Must Be Given Priority"--first paragraph is LE SOIR 
introduction] 
  [Text] General Jean Berhin is the Army chief of staff. For 
two years he has been carrying out the government's decision to 
professionalize the Army. Is this a makeshift reform? 
  [Berhin] Professionalization is much more than eliminating 
military service, which was the initial objective of the 
political decision. 
  [Alsteens] The troops based across the Rhine will be brought 
home around mid-1994. This affects 4,000 families. The 
regrouping of units will also lead to more than 10,000 transfers 
this year. How can a "big upheaval" like that be managed? 
  [Berhin] By giving priority to social issues: First, no 
redundancies; second, one year's notification of the next 
posting; and third, taking into consideration the soldiers' 
choices. Everyone has to select three postings accompanied by a 
justification. So far 60 percent of soldiers have been given 
their first choice. We have deliberately given priority to 
social factors...at the expense of operational factors. This is 
a risk which we have taken. We must now rebuild units to obtain 
a degree of cohesion by 1997. The coming years will be very 
difficult. The professional army will not be established 
overnight. 
  [Alsteens] You are currently touring the units to meet your 
men. What are their main anxieties? 
  [Berhin] Our social effort is being recognized. The 
essential questions relate to the army's future. I cannot give 
them a satisfactory answer on that. 
  [Alsteens] Personal problems are being raised. For instance 
for Belgian-German couples. 
  [Berhin] It is true that some households are facing 
extremely 
painful choices: To stay in Germany and leave the army or to 
come back to Belgium. Strong households overcome these 
problems. For the others, it is sometimes the last straw. 
Soldiers' wives are often less mobile than their husbands. The 
problem is even greater when it comes to German wives. 
(silence... -- LE SOIR editor's note) When you tour the 
garrisons, it is not easy to come face-to-face with a man who 
blames you for this problem. You do not know what to say. 
  [Alsteens] One of the problems of repatriation is housing. 
It has not yet been solved. 
  [Berhin] For two years we have been drawing the minister's 
attention to this problem, without results, however. Except 
that he has announced his intention of building 250 family homes 
by the end of the year. I doubt that this deadline will be met. 
And then, this has come rather late... However, I hope that 
this initial step will be followed by others. 
  [Alsteens] Some soldiers are complaining that those being 
repatriated will have priority in the granting of these homes... 
  [Berhin] The German criterion is not the only one. But we 
must now draw a distinction between those who have a house and 
those who do not. This means that the military housing of those 
without priority will have to be released. I know that 
pensioners will also be affected. Social inquiries will have to 
be made. Not all pensioners are corporals... 
  [Alsteens] The professional army's main problem will be 
recruitment, especially of short-term soldiers. 
  [Berhin] This is the crux of the whole reform. We need an 
army of trained, motivated, and, above all, available 
volunteers. The legal framework does not yet exist. That is 
hampering us considerably. Recruitment is running parallel to 
the release of surplus staff. This is vital to secure financial 
resources for rehiring. Young men are needed for fighting 
roles. At the level of the troops, the ideal is to have a 
structure which is 65 percent "short-term" and 35 percent 
"career" soldiers. 
  [Alsteens] This is likely to present a problem of surplus 
numbers at the level of the troops too. 
  [Berhin] The minister denies this problem. But we will have 
to find room for the "short-term" soldiers in the troops. In 
the army, we have 300 officers and 1,600 junior officers too 
many. The number of surplus soldiers has not yet been assessed. 
  [Alsteens] What will your short-term requirements be in 
normal times? 
  [Berhin] We will hire 1,250 "short-term" soldiers each year 
compared with 725 career soldiers. 
  [Alsteens] So the surplus number of "career" soldiers by 
1997 
could be almost 5,000? 
  [Berhin] I would not say that. That would mean revolution. 
  [Alsteens] Where is there currently a shortage of 
candidates? 
  [Berhin] In fighting roles we have a constant shortage. We 
are now dreaming of units constituted as such that can be formed 
overnight. The deficit is even more glaring in the 
Dutch-speaking units. If we keep all the volunteers, at the 
expense of the age pyramid and principles of efficiency, we will 
obtain a nearly complete French-speaking contingent, but a 
Flemish contingent which is only 80 percent complete. The 
problem is that we are soon likely to have an army which 
respects the 60/40 [language] ratio in its officers but whose 
troops are mainly French-speaking. Our first recruitment 
campaign will be mainly directed toward the north. 
  [Alsteens] What are you suggesting to ensure the required 
departures? 
  [Berhin] The minister has proposed that people leave for the 
communes and regions.... That does not seem to be meeting with 
great success. The general staff has produced a new plan. 
Soldiers with less than five years before retirement could be 
given their full pension and, in the period of time between now 
and the official pension date, would receive payment at least 
equal to that pension. But that would not be enough, even by 
increasing internal mobility, for instance by placing soldiers 
in civilian jobs in the Army. We also want measures to release 
younger soldiers. For that we need significant bonuses. The 
minister is not showing any openness... Ultimately, that will 
make it impossible to send Belgian units abroad. Our units will 
no longer be credible. 
  [Alsteens] You need outstanding officers to reorganize or 
even rebuild these units.... 
  [Berhin] We need "nothing but" outstanding officers.... 
  [Alsteens] You also need an appropriate budget.... 
  [Berhin] The budget is fixed at 97 billion [currency not 
given] until 1997. We will then need a budget which makes it 
possible to implement the structures chosen by politics. But 97 
billion is not enough. We have been saying that since the start 
of the reform. And we have still not received any reply. We 
are, therefore, postponing vital investments. Our country is 
already lagging behind. We need a reasonable effort to remain 
credible. It is time the statements were acted on. Without 
that, Belgium's military will no longer have a say in the 
European and international military institutions. Without this 
reasonable budget effort, we will soon only have an army on 
paper. 
<H5>  A Tool in Claes' Hands </H5>
  [Alsteens] The professionalization of the Army is being 
carried out at the same time as an unparalleled commitment of 
Belgian soldiers throughout the world. Is this a contradiction? 
  [Berhin] We have become a tool of Belgian foreign policy. At 
present it is Willy Claes who has matters in hand. It is he who 
is requesting the interventions because Belgium wishes to play 
an active role within the United Nations. It is the military 
which has reservations about new interventions. 
  [Alsteens] Is Willy Claes the boss of national defense? What 
is Minister Delcroix doing? 
  [Berhin] The national defense minister is there to define 
and 
pass on the limit of our resources within the government. 
  [Alsteens] Is the Army really supplying the maximum blue 
helmet contingent? 
  [Berhin] Yes, this limit has been reached. In 1993, we had 
2,000 men permanently on missions. The end of the mission to 
Somalia corresponded with the start of the mission in Rwanda. 
The contingent in Africa has been halved to 450 men. We still 
have around 1,000 in the former Yugoslavia: In Baranja, and 
also engineering and transport troops in Bosnia. Last week, an 
armored infantry unit moved from Baranja to Bosnia, to much more 
exposed terrain. We must take care; These interventions are far 
from being routine. The danger exists, we must take account of 
it. So far, blue helmets still seem to be respected. They are 
not being used systematically as targets. That is reassuring. 
  [Alsteens] Proportionally, Belgium, together with France, is 
the biggest supplier of blue helmets. Why are Belgian soldiers 
popular? 
  [Berhin] Their efficiency, their training, their 
responsibility are recognized. Moreover, Belgium only sends 
career volunteers. These men are mature. This is an important 
factor. Finally, compared with other countries, the Belgians 
are operational as soon as they arrive on the scene. They take 
everything with them. Other countries send troops without 
equipment. 
  [Alsteens] Does the dispatch of Belgian troops on such a 
scale present some human problems? 
  [Berhin] Absence sometimes has major consequences for 
families. For some, who are already experiencing problems, it is 
the last straw. We hear about that later from chaplains or 
psychological services. The first missions lasted six months 
with 10 days leave in the middle. We have now reduced them to 
four months. That is preferable. 
  [Alsteens] However, the families are "supported...." 
  [Berhin] That is done at the level of the units. The 
families are kept informed during operations. They see each 
other, can send video messages... It is important to show that 
the Army is also concerned with the families. We have also 
noted the importance which they attach to links with the family 
member who is on the mission. This is essential for the morale 
of all. However, the mail never travels fast enough for them.

  [Text] Chile is to buy 20 Mirage fighter planes from 
Belgium. This was confirmed by the Chilean defense minister. 
The 20 planes will replace the Chilean British planes which 
date from the fifties. It's not known exactly how much the 
Chileans are paying for the planes, but an amount of three 
billion francs was mentioned earlier. The planes are up for sale 
as a result of the cutbacks in the Belgian Army. The planes 
were previously refurbished.

<F P=106> [Article signed KvdB: "PS Plummeting, VLD Losing Much </F>
Ground; Agalev and Flemish Bloc Only Flemish Winners in February 
Poll"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- The PS [Walloon Socialist Party] is 
suffering very adverse effects from the continuous scandals 
which have been ravaging the government in recent months. The 
February poll, conducted by Dimarso on behalf of DE MORGEN, 
reveals that the Walloon Socialists only represent 30.1 percent 
of the French-speaking electorate, representing a 6-percent drop 
since December. 
  In Flanders, the VLD's [Flemish Liberals and Democrats] 
progress seems to have come to a standstill. Party leader 
Verhofstadt and his supporters lost 1.5 percent (down to 28.5 
percent), and are now at their lowest level since July 1993. 
Dimarso's monthly poll was conducted between 7 and 16 February 
among 1,000 Flemish, 1,000 Walloons, and 400 people from 
Brussels. There was a "no response" from 18 percent of those 
questioned. 
  In Flanders, the majority parties are not benefiting from 
the 
VLD's downturn. The CVP [Christian People's Party] remains 
practically at the same level (21.8 percent), while the SP 
[Flemish Socialist Party] has dropped from 18.3 to 17.6 percent. 
Even the Volksunie [People's Union] has fallen from 6.6 to 6.3 
percent, despite the strong European list it disclosed in 
February. 
  The winners are Agalev [Live Differently] (up 0.7 percent to 
11.3 percent), the Vlaams Blok [Flemish Bloc] (from 9.7 percent 
to 11.5 percent), and Rossem (from 2 to 2.4 percent). 
<H5>  Walloon Region </H5>
  In the Walloon region, the PSC [Social Christian Party] is 
the biggest winner. Deprez' party registered a 1.5 percent 
increase to 20.1 percent; the PRL [Liberal Reformation Party] 
climbed slightly to 23 percent (up 0.7 percent); and the Ecolo 
[Ecologists] jumped to 16.3 percent (up 0.9 percent). The 
category "others," which in addition to the FDF [French-Speaking 
Front] and some minor leftwing parties includes ultraright-wing 
parties, lost some ground (from 11.2 to 10.5 percent).
