  [Excerpt] Are election programs on public and private 
sector TV fair? RAI asked a group of researchers from the 
University of Pavia to monitor the coverage given to the issues 
and the protagonists of the election campaign for nine days, 
from 25 February to 5 March. Programs scrutinized included news 
bulletins, debates, open forums, and light entertainment 
programs. Dario La Ruffa reports: 
  First of all, it should be said that the rules drawn up for 
the general election have limited political news coverage, 
especially on the Fininvest channels. Before the official start 
of the campaign the Fininvest channels allowed parties and 
candidates on average four times more space than during the 25 
February to 5 March period; RAI remained consistent. 
  Let us see who was given the most coverage on news bulletins 
between the end of February and the beginning of March: 
  The Liberal-Democratic [Forza Italia-Northern 
League-National 
Alliance, etc.] grouping -- excluding Radical leader Marco 
Pannella -- obtained 33.1 percent of political coverage on RAI. 
They obtained 41.6 percent of coverage on Fininvest channels. 
  The Progressive Alliance [Democratic Party of the 
Left-Network- Greens, etc.] obtained 30.5 percent of coverage on 
RAI news bulletins and 32.7 percent on Fininvest. 
  The center grouping -- the Pact for Italy and the Italian 
Popular Party -- obtained 25.0 percent of the coverage on RAI 
and 17.9 percent on the Fininvest channels. 
  Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia was the single party that 
obtained the most coverage on RAI news bulletins: 21.6 percent 
of the relevant air time. The PDS [Democratic Party of the 
Left] obtained almost the same amount of coverage: 21.5 percent. 
The gap was much larger on the Fininvest channels: Forza Italia 
obtained 29.2 percent of coverage and the PDS received 21.2 
percent. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Strasbourg, March 10 (AFP) -- The European 
Parliament Thursday [10 March] called on EU [European Union] 
member states to send more troops to war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to monitor a ceasefire in Sarajevo and have it extended to other 
regions 
  "NATO's riposte to Serb air forces which violated the 
Bosnian 
airspace has obviously had a salutary effect," a resolution 
adopted by European Union legislators said, referring to the 
downing by NATO fighters of four Serb warplanes over Bosnia last 
month. 
  The Parliament resolution said however that "the military 
aggression is being pursued and that Croats as well as Serbs 
continue to perpetrate atrocities in Bosnia-Hercegovina." 
  Parliament called on European Union ministers and the United 
Nations to take the necessary steps to immediately stop Serb 
militias from attacking Moslem-populated Srebrenica, Zepa, 
Maglaj, Tuzla and Bihac. 
  It also warned the Croatian government of sanctions if 
Zagreb 
continued to maintain troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Luxembourg, March 10 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] criticised the United States here Thursday [10 March] for 
trying to impose numerical export targets on Japan, but offered 
to work with Washington in pressing for lower Japanese trade 
barriers. 
  EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan said U.S. efforts to 
force 
open the Japanese market with numerical targets were 
inefficient, and violated commitments to free trade and 
multilateral dispute settlement. 
  He also warned the United States to exhaust all 
dispute-settling procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT) before resorting to its newly-reactivated Super 
301 regulation which allows trade reprisals. 
  Brittan's statement was a low-key reaction to remarks in 
Washington on Wednesday by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor, who attacked the European Union for previous criticism 
of American trade policy towards Japan. 
  "The European Union is as determined as the United States to 
see Japan enforcing bold measures that will help reduce the 
excessive trade surplus that exists both with the United States 
and the European Union," Brittan said. 
  Last month the EU commissioner suggested a "trilateral 
approach" involving Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo to negotiate 
easier access to the Japanese market. 
  Kantor said on Wednesday that the United States was ready 
for 
such an approach. Brittan replied: "I am ready to begin work 
immediately with the United States and Japan to resolve these 
difficulties." 
  Japan had a trade surplus of more than 50 billion dollars 
with the United States in 1993, and about 26 billion dollars 
with the European Union. 
  Fighting trade talk across the North Atlantic has flared up 
again less than five weeks ahead of the April 15 signing date 
for the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. 
  Kantor accused the European Union on Wednesday of hypocrisy 
for sniping at Washington during its trade dispute with Japan, 
while at the same time taking advantage of the U.S. 
market-opening leverage. 
  He also attacked EU trade barriers against foreign films and 
television programmes, telecommunications equipment, cars and 
trucks. 
  Brittan replied: "The European Union also has a very long 
list of U.S. trade barriers, some of which have been in 
existence for decades and which cause distortions to 
international trade. 
  ``What we must all do is to work to remove them 
constructively through negotiation, rather than resorting to 
finger-pointing,'' the EU trade commissioner said. 
  An EU spokesman said U.S. trade barriers included 
discriminatory taxes on European cars and passenger vans, and 
the Buy America Act -- which effectively shut European firms out 
of airport, road, rail and underground rail projects.

  [Text] Vienna, March 10 KYODO -- Inspections of North 
Korean nuclear facilities, suspected as part of a suspected 
nuclear arms development program, are not progressing according 
to schedule, sources at the International Atomic Energy Agency 
said Thursday [10 March]. 
  The sources said the inspections to ensure that North Korea 
has not been diverting nuclear fuel to military purposes may not 
be completed by March 14 or 15 as originally scheduled. 
  An IAEA official said the inspectors are not being denied 
access to North Korea's seven declared nuclear sites and that 
there is still time to complete the inspections, refusing to 
acknowledge a possible delay in their safeguards checks. 
  The sources, however, said North Korean officials have 
reportedly told inspectors that it is "not necessary" to check a 
certain number of sites before the nuclear experts have had a 
chance to look for themselves. 
  Diplomatic sources have suggested the lack of progress may 
have been influenced by the stalemate in inter-Korean 
working-level talks Wednesday on the exchange of presidential 
envoys. 
  Washington has already tied a third round of high-level 
talks 
with Pyongyang in Geneva on March 21 to the completion of the 
IAEA inspections and the dialogue on envoys. 
  The sources here suggested that if the inspections are 
delayed, the U.S.-North Korean talks will be placed in a 
delicate situation. 
  Further, if IAEA inspectors cannot ensure the continuity of 
the nuclear safeguards, the issue will likely be referred to the 
U.N. Security Council, which could call for sanctions against 
Pyongyang. 
  Meanwhile in Seoul, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) 
reported that the inspectors have found some of the seals on 
equipment to ensure the nuclear safeguards may have been damaged. 
  The seals were among those in seven declared sites in 40 
locations. 
  However, there appeared to be nothing unusual on the seals 
on 
the 5,000-kilowatt reactor in the nuclear complex at Yongbyon, 
some 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, KBS reported quoting IAEA 
sources.

<F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F>
Ruth Berschens; place and date not given: "Increase in 
Value-Added Tax"] 
  [Text] [Berschens] Mr. Paye, the economics and finance 
ministers of the seven most important industrialized states will 
meet in Detroit next weekend to discuss what can be done against 
unemployment. Do you expect the special summit to be more than 
just a big media spectacle? 
  [Paye] I think it is very good that President Clinton has 
convened this conference. The special summit is useful just 
because it directs public attention to a problem, for which the 
alarm bells have been ringing here in Europe for years. The 
governments increasingly now are trying to find recipes against 
unemployment. 
  [Berschens] So far, they, particularly in Europe, have not 
had a lot of ideas. 
  [Paye] We in Europe are paying the bill now for the fact 
that politicians and partners to the wage negotiations believed 
in growth far too long. Until the end of the 1980's, it was 
assumed that the high growth rates of the 1950's and 1960's 
could be reached again. As a result, one continued to be 
generous with wage raises, with pensions, and with the services 
of health insurance. The expansion of the social net has made 
the European economies increasingly inflexible, even though they 
should be more flexible than ever -- in view of the racing 
technological progress and the rising pressure of international 
competition. 
  [Berschens] What do the Europeans have to do? 
  [Paye] They must abolish negative developments in the tax 
system and in social security. In some countries, excessive 
ancillary wage costs prevent the employers from hiring people. 
It also happens that an unemployed person earns more in net 
terms than if we were working. Why should he then look for a 
new job? In addition, there is the abuse of social services. 
The labor exchange office, for instance, would have to cancel 
unemployment benefits if the recipient refused to accept an 
appropriate job. 
  [Berschens] Your proposals harbor the danger that the poor 
will get even poorer. 
  [Paye] There is no doubt that the necessary structural 
reforms require great sacrifices from parts of the population. 
Certainly, those affected must not be simply dropped. If these 
people get the feeling they are hopeless losers, then we will be 
facing a social explosion sooner or later. Therefore, state and 
society must help the people to react flexibly to new 
requirements on the labor market, above all through improved 
training and retraining. 
  [Berschens] You want the state to pursue a more active labor 
market policy, to reduce payroll tax, and to take over part of 
the ancillary wage costs. At the same time, however, you demand 
a reduction of the budget deficits. How is this going to work? 
  [Paye] If the state wants to get the money back from another 
source, it would be conceivable to raise value-added tax or the 
energy taxes. As a third alternative in our report, we suggest 
an increase in capital-yield tax.... 
  [Berschens] ...which would immediately provoke capital 
flight, as in Germany after the introduction of the withholding 
tax. 
  [Paye] Any tax increase harbors risks. By the way, the 
danger of capital flight would be clearly lower if all 24 OECD 
states could decide to take such a step together. 
  [Berschens] The unemployment rate in the United States is 
clearly lower than in the European states. Do the Europeans 
have to imitate the U.S. hire-and-fire system? 
  [Paye] The direction is correct, but the Europeans cannot go 
as far as the Americans. In times of an upswing, the U.S. 
system works like a machine that produces jobs. This is also 
due to the enormous mobility of the Americans regarding jobs and 
distances. In Europe, however, there will always be a denser 
social net than in the United States. 
  [Berschens] Really? The French have just introduced minimum 
wages for adolescents, which is almost as much as social welfare 
in Germany. 
  [Paye] I have four children. For them, it would still be 
better to work for a low salary than to be unemployed. In the 
long run, one cannot pay the people above the level of their 
productivity, unless society expresses sufficient solidarity. 
  [Berschens] Unemployment in Germany will continue to 
increase more strongly and for a longer period than in other 
European states, according to the OECD forecast. Have the 
Germans in particular committed many mistakes? 
  [Paye] The influx of hundreds of thousands of immigrants and 
ethnic Germans from abroad has put a great strain on the German 
labor market. In addition, the country has not yet overcome the 
shock of reunification. The economy is suffering under the high 
state debts and the pressure of inflation. Here I think the 
other Europeans have to share responsibility. 
  [Berschens] Are you saying that the British and the French 
should have contributed to paying the costs of unification? 
  [Paye] Of course, something like that is easier said than 
done. The French may have understood this more easily than the 
poorer Irish, Spanish, or Greeks. Nevertheless, it was a 
mistake to leave the country with the strongest economy and with 
Europe's key currency alone with the shock of reunification, in 
particular since everyone had to suffer from the German policy 
of high interest rates. The Europeans would have been better off 
if the burden had been shared right from the beginning.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Papoulias Makes Announcements on </F>
Bosnia and Greek Trade Sanctions"; as released by Brussels 
TEXTLINE database] 
  [Text] In his speech on Bosnia before the European 
Parliament [EP], the President of the Council of the European 
Union [EU], Mr. Papoulias, was able, for the first time in 
months, to note a number of positive developments such as 
progress in negotiations between Muslims and Croats, return to 
calm in Sarajevo, and the prospect of reopening Tuzla airport. 
The European Union will continue to play a "pioneer role" to 
try to contribute to a global solution acceptable to all and 
viable at long term, said Mr. Papoulias. He stressed that "each 
of us must bring a stone to the building" and that Russian 
participation in this process is indispensable. Furthermore, 
the Council President announced that a group of experts would be 
going to Mostar very shortly in order to examine the modalities 
for temporary administration of the town by the European Union. 
  Mr. Papoulias also spoke of the dispute between Athens and 
Skopje. As Greek Foreign Minister, he stated that the embargo 
against the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [as received] 
was necessary to allow Greece to "defend itself" against 
aggression from Skopje authorities which, he said, have not done 
anything to normalise the situation. Mr. Papoulias recalled 
that, on 10 March, he is to have a talk in this connection with 
UN mediator for Skopje, Cyrus Vance. He was reasonably 
optimistic as to the possibility of settling the dispute. The 
European Commission, recalled Hans van den Broek, has clearly 
stated that the Greek sanctions, which are "virtually an 
embargo," are in contradiction with Community law. He went on 
to say that the Commission hopes the embargo will be lifted in 
the near future and that there will be normalisation between 
Athens and Skopje. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, he noted 
the positive changes that have come about over the past weeks 
and welcomed, in particular, the fact that humanitarian aid can 
be resumed. We shall calculate new needs in close collaboration 
with the UN High Commission for Refugees, he announced. Several 
of the MEPs [members of EP] taking the floor reproached Greece 
for its decision on the embargo against Skopje. Dutch Socialist 
Mr. Woltjer said he hoped the embargo would be lifted and that 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would, for its part, 
modify its Constitution and its flag. Dutch Liberal Mr. Bertens 
found this decision "incomprehensible." Mr. Bertens also hoped 
that additional troops would be sent to UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] in order to extend the warning which worked in Sarajevo 
and other areas in Bosnia. Italian Green Alexandre Langer said 
the embargo against Skopje is "the least European, the least 
cooperative" thing imaginable: In these circumstances, he 
asked, what good is it to envisage a Pact on Stability in 
Europe? Several Members of the EP voiced concern about the 
aggressiveness of the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and 
fears about the inviolability of the frontiers between this 
country and Greece. Mr. Ephremidis (Left Unity) called Athens' 
decisions "constructive" and capable of obtaining positive 
results in the face of growing nationalism and Socialist Mr. 
Papoutsis said the Greek people support its government's 
decision and that, legally, Greece is acting within its rights 
since it acted on the basis of Article 224, which has been used 
by other countries on other occasions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "EU Budget: Members Split Over Delors </F>
II Package"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] European Union [EU] countries were reported on March 
8 to be at loggerheads over the budgetary adjustments tied in 
with the Edinburgh Summit agreement on how to fund EU activities 
over the 1993-99 period ("Delors II" package of financial 
measures) and the disagreements were particularly acrimonious 
over the adjustments to farm spending. France wants an 
agreement to be wrought before Union membership for Austria, 
Sweden, Finland and Norway as this would provide French farmers 
with guarantees about funding for the agricultural sector. 
There was still some hope of clearing this matter of all 
obstacles before the end of the March 8 Council of Foreign 
Ministers in Brussels, for Ministers were debating the subject 
afresh just as European Report was going to press at the end of 
the afternoon. 
  The most prickly problem is to do with the money available 
for the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP], as this is a highly 
controversial subject for France and southern Member States. 
Ministers are at odds on three major questions left unanswered 
by the political decision-making at Edinburgh in December 
1992: 

  -  The main thing is to fix the voting rules - unanimity 
or qualified majority voting - to change the farm speeding 
ceiling - (the agricultural guideline) if there is not enough 
money in the pot to cover all the needs. This problem is likely 
to arise come enlargement day, for the guideline which is 
calculated on the basis of the EU GNP will then increase. 
Sticklers for budgetary rectitude, the UK and the Netherlands 
are calling for unanimous voting, whereas France and the 
southerners want qualified majority decision-making. 
  -  Another 
vexatious issue is to do with the procedures for using the 
monetary reserve provided to offset any increased CAP costs as a 
result of monetary fluctuations. 
  -  Lastly, Italy is seeking 
financial guarantees that extra costs tied in with running 
market organisations for Mediterranean produce will be 
chargeable to the farm budget. 
  Less prickly subjects are the review of the Union budget 
funding system (own resources). The main problem here is a 
German one, for this country is facing a wave of protests from 
its citizens who feel that the Germany contribution to the EU 
Budget is far too high. Germany is calling for more transparency 
in the application of costs and tougher controls over the 
formula for allocating expenditure. Bonn upholds the idea of 
creating an EU Budget supervisory body, but this has foundered 
on the misgivings of several delegations that point out that the 
job is already being done by the Court of Auditors. 
  Less confrontational is the issue of budgetary balances. 
Several countries want money left unspent in the Budget to be 
carried forward two years instead of one. The review of the EU 
Budget funding system proposes that as from January 1, 1995 the 
VAT [value-added tax] base should be reduced from 55 to 50 
percent of GNP and the VAT call-up rate should be cut from 1.4 
to 1 percent for Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland. These 
changes will on the other hand taper off between 1995 and 1999 
in the case of the other Union countries. Italy dislikes the 
review decided upon by the European Council, for it means an 
significant increase in the country's Budget contribution.

<F P=106> [Article signed JCS: "Committee of the Regions Is </F>
Inaugurated"; as released by the Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 9 Mar (BELGA) -- The Committee of the 
Regions, a new European institution which is to represent the 
interests of the regions and local government in the European 
Union (EU), was formally inaugurated in Brussels on Wednesday [8 
March]. 
  The new institution's senior person, the Luxembourger Leon 
Bollendorf, said in his opening speech that for the first time 
in European history federal states, regions, departments, 
provinces and local governments could give shape to their wish 
to take part in the decisionmaking process within the EU. 
  This "decentralization" is intended to close the gap with 
European citizens. The Committee should ensure that the EU 
became a tangible reality for normal citizens, Bollendorf said. 
  The Committee of the Regions should give shape to this new 
"realpolitik" and involve citizens in its activities, otherwise 
there was a danger that citizens would regard the new 
institution as a new European administrative body, he said. 
  The Committee of the Regions has virtually no powers. Member 
states are only required to consult the Committee about 
legislative work in five fields: Economic and social subjects 
related to areas including the cohesion and structural funds, 
the trans-European networks (in the energy, transport and 
telecommunications sectors), education, culture and public 
health. 
  Bollendorf said the committee should also make a 
contribution 
toward improving urban living conditions and security. In that 
field the situation had got completely out of hand, with every 
conceivable consequence for the stability of our democratic 
structures, he said. The committee should seek a solution for 
this painful problem, he said. 
  The Committee of the Regions has 189 members who are chosen 
for four-year terms. It consists of representatives at regional 
and local levels. Both groups have an approximately equal share 
in the number of members and deputy members. The Socialists and 
Christian Democrats are the two strongest groups in the new 
institution. 
  On Wednesday afternoon the committee will elect a president 
and decide on its activities. Flemish Prime Minister Luc van 
den Brande is one of the candidates for the presidency.

East Peace Talks"; as released by Brussels Euroscope EIS 
Database] 
  [Text] Meeting in Brussels on March 7, the EU's Foreign 
Affairs Ministers made clear that the Middle East peace process 
should not be interrupted as a result of the February 25 
massacre during the Ramadan prayer in the Palestinian town of 
Hebron -- an act of violence that they have already strongly 
condemned. In a political statement issued on March 7, the 
twelve EU Member States welcomed the measures recently adopted 
by the Israeli Government to ensure the safety of Palestinians, 
and pointed out that Israel is responsible for the safety and 
protection of all inhabitants in the Occupied Territories. They 
appealed to the parties to the Middle East conflict for talks on 
the question of "the safety of Palestinians, including the issue 
of certain settlements, and to agree on appropriate measures." 
They called on the UN Security Council to adopt "an appropriate 
Resolution" as swiftly as possible and advocated the 
establishment in the Occupied Territories of "an international 
presence in which the European Union declares its willingness to 
participate." 
  The Greek Foreign Minister and current President of the EU 
Council of Ministers, Carolos Papoulias, said after the debate 
on the Middle East that all his colleagues agreed on the need to 
support the case of the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who is viewed 
as a vital element in the peace process.

  [Text] The third Euro-Arab meeting, held on Tuesday [8 
March], brought together 29 delegates from 14 Arab countries and 
several Members of the European Parliament [EP], who discussed 
political and economic support for the Middle East peace 
process, stability and security in the Arab world and Europe, 
and Euro-Arab economic cooperation. Recent events, especially 
the Hebron massacre, were in the forefront at this time, as 
participants observed a minute of silence in tribute to the 
victims at the opening of the session. All the delegations 
acknowledged the importance of continuing the peace process, 
noted Mr. Claude Cheysson (Socialist, French) at the press 
conference following the conclusion of the meeting. 
  Participants also insisted on the importance of providing 
protection for the Palestinian population under United Nations 
auspices.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Research: Commission To </F>
Vote on Three Specific Research Programmes"; as released by 
Brussels Euroscope EIS Database] 
  [Text] The European Commission is due to vote on March 10 
on its proposed Decisions for nuclear research over the next 
four years. As the Council of Ministers has still not adopted 
the 4th Framework Programme for European Union R&amp;D of which 
the 
specific nuclear programmes form part, it is not yet clear what 
procedure the coming Commission meeting will adopt: Any change 
in the overall budget agreed on for the Framework Programme 
could, of course, have repercussions on the amount available for 
the specific programmes. 
  There are three specific Euratom programmes for Union 
research and education actions in the nuclear domain, covering 
nuclear safety and security, controlled thermonuclear fusion and 
the future activities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) between 
1995 and 1998. The draft Decisions which are due to be adopted 
on March 10 set out the criteria which should govern the 
selection of joint EU action in these fields, the scientific and 
technological aims of the programmes and, of course, the budget 
figures. Provisional funding for the three programmes is set at 
160 million ECUs, 794 mECUs and 300 mECUs for nuclear safety, 
fusion and JRC activities respectively. 
<H5>  Nuclear Safety </H5>
  Although the EU's nuclear industry is considered relatively 
safe, at least when compared with other parts of the world, it 
remains unacceptable in the eyes of significant sections of 
European society. 
  The Commission argues, therefore, that European research in 
this field should be targeted towards raising understanding of 
the issues involved and awareness of the risks associated with 
the use of nuclear energy and the entire nuclear fuel cycle. 
The technical maturity of EU nuclear technology by no means 
rules out the desirability of seeking new technological 
solutions for the industry's problems, particularly 
concentrating on the areas of radiation exposure for people and 
the environment. 
  The activities proposed illustrate the new approach the 
Commission would like to adopt, exploring ways of improving the 
use of nuclear energy through an integrated approach dealing 
with the three areas that cause most concern: reactor safety, 
management of highly-radioactive material and the dangers of 
fissile material falling into the wrong hands. 
<H5>  Nuclear Fusion </H5>
  The long-term aim of EU action in this field, which brings 
together in one international programme all the thermonuclear 
fusion activities carried out in the EU Member States, Sweden 
and Switzerland, is to produce safe and environmentally-friendly 
prototype reactors, which can eventually be used to produce 
acceptably-priced electricity. It will take decades and huge 
amounts of cash to attain this goal. For the period 1994-1998, 
the priority aim is to set out the detailed plans for the Next 
Step experimental reactor, whose purpose is to demonstrate the 
scientific and technological feasibility of nuclear fusion for 
peaceful purposes. Next Step comes under the four-partner 
cooperation between Euratom, the US, Japan and Russia on 
ITER-EDA, the International Thermonuclear Experimental 
Reactor-Engineering Design Activities. 
  In parallel, research efforts will be concentrated on two 
other areas of activity: 
  a) improving the technological concepts necessary for the 
design, in the more distant future, of a demonstration reactor 
(DEMO) capable of producing substantial quantities of 
electricity; and 
  b) in the even more distant future, providing technically-, 
economically- and environmentally-acceptable solutions to the 
problems associated with using nuclear fusion to produce energy. 
These activities will be conducted through both DEMO and ITER. 
  Given the overwhelming cost and time-span involved, the 
Commission intends actively to encourage industry to participate 
in the research and will be examining the possibilities of 
extending international cooperation beyond ITER. 
<H5>  Joint Research Centre </H5>
  The JRC will continue to conduct strategic and applied 
European research. In accordance with the priorities set out in 
the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, its 
activities will be geared towards reinforcing the international 
competitivity of European industry. They will also aim to 
guarantee the independent scientific expertise necessary for 
implementating EU policies, provide the EU institutions with 
competent scientific services, improve public safety and 
environmental protection and, finally, reduce the disparities 
existing between the Member States in terms of scientific and 
technological know-how. 
  Over the next four years, the Commission recommends that the 
work of the JRC should be concentrated on two categories of 
research into nuclear fission safety and controlled 
thermonuclear fusion: institutional research activities, on the 
one hand, and scientific and technical support for EU policies, 
on the other.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "After Flight 63"] </F>
  [Text] On January 25, 1994, fourteen hours after the 
failure of Flight 63, Arianespace Chairman Charles Bigot held a 
press conference in Kourou. His initial comments were: 
  "Flight 63 was interrupted after a perfect sequence of 
preparation, checking and launch operations, after normal 
functioning of the first and second stages and strap-on 
boosters, after equally correct separation and ignition of the 
third stage, followed by normal operation for approximately 80 
seconds. Then the third staged stopped. The two satellites 
could not be placed into orbit, and the stage and satellites 
fell into the Atlantic Ocean, a few thousand miles from the 
African coast. 
  ``We would like to report our apologies and regrets to our 
two customers, for an accident which deprives them of the 
services expected from their satellites, TURKSAT 1A and EUTELSAT 
II-F6. We deeply share their disappointment (...). 
  ``After 26 highly-successful launches over close to four 
years, we have placed 40 satellites into orbit in a most 
satisfactory and, in most cases, remarkable manner. Today, 
Ariane meets with a failure. We take this failure very 
seriously, but also calmly, because we know that our launch 
system is reliable. We also know that it is not perfect. We 
will therefore actively look for all causes of the accident and 
correct them. This will make our system stronger and more 
reliable. 
  ``As of now, our analysis of the initial parameters is as 
follows: The third-stage engine stopped because the liquid 
oxygen turbopump stopped after about 80 seconds of operation, 
thus ending the oxygen flow. The turbopump itself stopped 
functioning because of abnormal heating of a turbopump shaft 
bearing. 
  ``Naturally, it is now up to the Inquiry Board to thoroughly 
analyze and understand the reasons for this excessive heating. 
  ``The nature of this event allow us to hope for a diagnosis 
and the definition of corrective measures without delay. With 
the help of the entire industry, the French space agency CNES 
and the European Space Agency, Arianespace is determined to make 
all efforts required for a quick resumption of launches. 
  ``We maintain our launch objectives over the duration of our 
order book, as Arianespace's priority is always to serve its 
customers. Naturally, all further information will be given to 
them in priority, in accordance with the policy of total 
transparency which presides over all our customer relations.'' 
<H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>
<H5>  Appointment of the Inquiry Board </H5>
  Following the failure of Ariane's 63rd flight on January 24, 
1994, Arianespace, in liaison with ESA and CNES, has set up on 
January 26 an Inquiry Board composed of independent experts. 
Its mandate is to establish the causes of the failure of Flight 
63 and to recommend all the necessary measures to be taken to 
correct the anomalies found. The Inquiry Board is composed of 
the following members: 
  - President: Jean-Paul Herteman (SNECMA, France) 
  - Vice-president: Eric Slachmuylders (ESA) 
  Carl-Helmut Dederra (DASA, Germany) 
  Mauro Varetti (FIAT, Italy) 
  Jean-Paul Bozet (Universite de Liege, 
Belgium) 
  Michel Pons (CNES, France) 
  It is requested that the Board submit its initial 
conclusions 
in mid-February.

Vaclav Klaus met on Thursday [10 March] morning with his Belgian 
counterpart, Jean-Luc Dehaene, as part of his one-day working 
visit to European Union and NATO Headquarters. 
  The two pime ministers talked primarily about the European 
integration process, the development and vision of a more united 
Europe, and about future Czech membership in the European Union. 
  Dehaene told journalists afterwards that the meeting had 
been 
productive, and said he shared Klaus' "vision" of Europe. Klaus 
said the two of them agreed that a country like the Czech 
Republic must increase its ties to NATO, the EU and other 
international organisations. "We have to find something between 
association and full membership in the European Union," he said, 
adding that Dehaene had accepted his invitation to visit the 
Czech Republic in the near future. 
  Afterward Klaus met with European Commission President 
Jacques Delors. Commissioner for Foreign Relations Hans van den 
Broek was unable to attend the meeting as had been expected, 
since he was out of town in connection with talks on Norway's 
admission to the EU.

<F P=106> [John Palmer report: "Ridicule Mocks the Sublime"] </F>
  [Text] In the European Union [EU], the sublime and the 
ridiculous frequently couple in bizarre partnerships. The 
latest crisis over enlargement of the EU this week is a case in 
point. 
  The admission of Austria, England, Norway and Sweden 
contributes a key building block in the future European Union. 
According to sublime theory the Union could, by the end of the 
decade, stretch from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and from 
the Atlantic to the borders of Russia. 
  But, thanks to a ridiculous Norwegian/Spanish dispute over 
approximately 7,000 tons of cod and arcane objections by the 
British to proposed changes in voting powers in the Council of 
Ministers, the entire enlargement project could yet collapse. 
The British government, which has consistently championed the 
expansion of the Union, now risks being seen as the main 
architect of its downfall. 
  In striking contrast to recent speeches emphasising "Britain 
at the heart of Europe," the British government has decided to 
turn the debate about the precise level at which countries 
should be able to block majority decisions into a great issue of 
principle. In so doing, ministers have provided Euro-sceptic 
MPs with a new cause to boost their flagging crusade against EU 
and revive internecine warfare in the Tory party. 
  John Major could find he has just handed a loaded revolver 
to 
his Euro-sceptic enemies which will be used against him in the 
run-up to the crucial European Parliament elections. Against 
the strong advice of Foreign Office professionals who concluded 
weeks ago that the UK could not get its way over the votes 
issue, cabinet ministers insisted on pursuing their cackhanded 
tactics. 
  Douglas Hurd and his colleagues may now have to choose 
between a humiliating climbdown or standing firm. This might 
not only endanger enlargement but would certainly alienate both 
EU partners and potential allies among the candidate countries. 
  The row with Norway over Spanish fishing rights may be 
sorted 
out soon. But if the 32 cannot agree -- primarily with the 
British -- on just how the new voting rules will work in the 
Council of Ministers when the Union grows to 16 members, 
enlargement may be postponed to 1996 or even abandoned. 
  Restive members of the European Parliament have already 
warned they will not ratify the accession treaties if thc voting 
issue is not resolved or if a solution is found which makes 
majority voting more difficult. If the British get their way 
this is precisely what will happen. The wider implications of 
the collapse of EU enlargement could be enormous. The 
governments of the four applicant countries already have a major 
fight on their hands convincing their voters to support EU 
membership in referendums to be held later this year. If their 
membership bids have to be shelved, public opinion in the Nordic 
countries could turn very hostile to any future European 
entanglement. 
  If the EU cannot agree terms for admitting countries as 
similar as Austria amd the three Nordic states, what chance of 
their absorbing the Hungarians, the Poles and others in East 
Europe who already seek EU membership? If they too are 
rejected, some in Central Europe will turn their back on the 
West and make peace with the growing forces of Slav nationalism 
in Russia as is already being canvassed in Slovakia and Bulgaria. 
  The repercussions in Germany could also be alarming. 
Chancellor Kohl -- and the Social Democrat opposition -- have 
defended the goal of a more federal EU against their critics 
precisely so that it is best placed to respond to the needs of 
Central and East Europe. If enlargement is pushed off the 
agenda, those already urging Germany to turn its back on 
European integration and to take a stronger "national" line 
towards the East will become more strident. 
  So why should the British (and to a lesser extent the 
Spanish) put all this at risk? UK ministers can fairly point to 
a bias in the present voting system in the Council of Ministers 
which over-represents smaller countries. The sensible reform 
would be to allocate votes in the Council more strictly in 
proportion to population. Reformers have also advocated that 
majority decisions in the Council should not only require a 
majority of votes but enough countries which, between them 
represent an overall majority of the EU population. 
  Logical as it may sound, this approach conflicts with 
ideological British Conservative hostility to a more democratic 
federal EU. Instead, the UK has focused obsessively, not on 
making majority decisions more representative but on 
strengthening its own power to block decisions on workers' 
rights, social standards and the environment. 
  The threatened disaster over enlargement will make the 
reformers more determined that the 1996 review of the Maastricht 
Treaty should entrench a democratic majority vote system. This 
can be underpinned with a formal EU constitution which would 
prevent one country vetoing the right of others to move to a 
deeper political Union. 
  Major could hardly object since he negotiated the British 
"opt-out" from the European social chapter and the single 
currency at Maastricht. It is a precedent which the British may 
regret since others in the EU are now determined to build on it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The IRA's Answer"] </F>
  [Text] Last night's mortar attack on Heathrow airport was 
the most eloquent response that the IRA is likely to make to the 
peace initiative launched with the Anglo-Irish declaration. The 
five mortars, apparently aimed from a vehicle in a hotel car 
park at one of the runways, instantly threw the world's largest 
international airport into chaos. A week and a half after the 
specious rhetoric of the Sinn Fein conference in Dublin, the 
Republican movement was once again speaking the language it 
knows best. 
  The immediate effect of the blast was to help secure the 
renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act by a majority of 86, 
after Labour forced a vote on an issue traditionally governed by 
bipartisan consensus. Yet its political significance was much 
broader. Since John Major and Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach, 
signed their declaration in December, Sinn Fein has sought to 
nurture an atmosphere of suspense and uncertainty. Having 
already won the offer of exploratory talks after a 12-week 
ceasefire, the IRA's political wing has encouraged the view that 
with more diplomacy, more concessions, and more attention to the 
Republican agenda it may be willing to lay down its arms. Its 
leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have called for 
"clarification," "demilitarisation" and British "persuasion" of 
the Unionists. 
  Last night, this deplorable tactic of studied indecision was 
shown for the mockery it always was. The IRA revealed that its 
true strategy is still one of attrition, an indefinite assault 
upon the weak points of the British political and economic 
system. This was its message in February 1991 when it launched 
a mortar attack upon the Gulf War Cabinet in No 10 [Downing 
Street]; in its bombing of the City in April 1992 and a year 
later; and now in its assault upon Heathrow. That the attack 
was thwarted will not concern the movement's military leaders 
unduly. Their purpose was to show the world that they could 
smuggle their artillery into the heart of an airport which is 
still the hub of the European network and a vital entrepot for 
transatlantic flights. To disable Heathrow is to strike a 
serious blow to the nation's economic credibility and reputation 
as a centre of tourism and trade. 
  The Government must now consider its own response. Those in 
Whitehall who argued last year that the IRA had become arthritic 
and was in serious operational decline must be blushing today. 
In the last three months, the Republican machine has flaunted 
the range of its capabilities, from Mr Adams's American 
propaganda trip to the continuation of the mainland campaign. 
Ministers and officials have noticeably distanced themselves 
from earlier claims in recent weeks. No longer is it argued in 
briefings that peace is imminent or even likely in the 
foreseeable future. Once billed as the starting- blocks of a 
rapid peace process, the Anglo-Irish declaration is now 
presented merely as a lapidary document outlining principles for 
an eventual settlement. But this shift of emphasis begs the 
question: where next? 
  The sooner the Prime Minister ceases to delude himself the 
better. The declaration has failed in its purpose and is no 
longer an even partially convincing foundation for government 
policy. Dublin must remember its promises to take appropriate 
action-meaning security measures -- if the initiative failed; 
President Clinton must give substance to his apparent 
disillusionment with Mr Adams by unequivocally supporting the 
British Government in its response to this attack. The 
Republican gauntlet has been thrown down at Mr Major's feet. 
Having invested so much capital in a failed peace process, he 
must show he is willing to invest similar energy in a quite 
different approach.

  [Text] Bonn/Moscow -- The Federal Government has confirmed 
that a Russian citizen has been arrested by the Moscow 
Counterintelligence Service. According to information received 
by DPA, he allegedly worked for the Federal Intelligence Service 
(BND). The Russian Counterintelligence Service reported that 
the agent, who was arrested on Thursday [10 March], will be 
indicted within 10 days. No further details have been divulged 
in Moscow. 
  A statement by the Chancellor's Office stressed that 
coordinator Bernd Schmidbauer, who is responsible for the German 
intelligence services, held a long and detailed talk with 
Safanov, the deputy head of the Russian Counterintelligence 
Service, this morning. 
  Safanov confirmed the arrest, "but made it clear that, from 
Russia's viewpoint, the matter is of no significance for 
political relations with Germany." Government Spokesman Dieter 
Vogel declined to confirm the arrested Russian's BND activities. 
  Aleksander Mikhailov, the press spokesman of the Russian 
Counterintelligence Service, told INTERFAX that the suspected 
agent, was arrested on Thursday and will be indicted within 10 
days. An unidentified Counterintelligence Service spokesman 
told ITAR-TASS: "Investigations continue. We have nothing else 
to say."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to DPA information, an agent 
of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) has been arrested on 
suspicion of espionage in Moscow. On Friday [11 March], 
Government Spokesman Dieter Vogel did not want to confirm to the 
press in Bonn that the arrested man worked for the BND, but it 
was reported in a statement from the Chancellor's Office that 
the Moscow counterintelligence service had confirmed the arrest 
of a Russian citizen. However, effects on Russian-German 
relations were not feared. In answer to an inquiry, the BND 
refused to make any statement. 
  Vogel continued by saying that it is a fact that 
intelligence 
services exist all over the world. Their work need not always 
have political effects. The intelligence services of Germany 
and Russia also cooperate in several respects. Vogel pointed out 
that official representatives of the German and Russian 
intelligence services are accredited in the embassies in Moscow 
or Bonn. In this way, cooperation, for example in the field of 
drugs and the combating of terrorism, is possible. The Russian 
counterintelligence service has not been able to produce any 
proof of intelligence service activities of the arrested man. 
  The Chancellor's Office statement says that Bernd 
Schmidbauer, coordinator responsible for the German intelligence 
services, had a long and exhaustive talk with Safanov, deputy 
head of the Russian counterintelligence service, on Friday 
morning. "Mr. Safanov confirmed the arrest of a Russian 
citizen, but he made it clear at the same time that, from 
Russia's point of view, the affair is of no consequence for the 
political relations with the FRG." 
  According to the Chancellor's Office, the open questions are 
to "be clarified exclusively in a constructive way at the level 
of the intelligence services," it was stated. Accordingly, 
Schmidbauer discussed the further proceedings with his partner 
in the talks. In the talks, the Russian side did not report on 
any details about the arrested person or on available proof of 
activities on behalf of a foreign intelligence service, it was 
stated. 
  In Bonn security circles, it was stated that there might be 
a 
connection with the espionage affair around Aldrich Ames in 
Washington. On 21 February, Ames, a high-ranking employee of 
the U.S. intelligence service, the CIA, and his wife Maria 
Rosario were arrested on suspicion of espionage for Russia in 
the United States. The U.S. intelligence services had found the 
supposed double agent Ames, who is charged with the death of 10 
U.S. agents, with the help of Stasi intelligence service 
documents. Security experts have assumed that the BND man in 
Moscow might have been exposed by information from Ames.

  [Text] Cologne, March 9 -- A six-person Polish delegation 
negotiated on Monday [7 March] and Tuesday in Bonn an agreement 
on cooperation between the police and the customs services of 
Poland and Germany and a technical protocol on re-admission of 
people who arrived in Germany via Poland and violated the terms 
of stay in that country. 
  "The talks with the Germans were conducted in a good 
atmosphere," said Polish Deputy Interior Minister Henryk Jasik 
before his return to Poland from Germany on Wednesday morning. 
  Jasik said that contacts between the leadership of the 
Polish 
and German Interior Ministries have developed well, while Polish 
Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski and his German 
counterpart had a good mutual understanding. 
  According to the asylum agreement of May 1993, Poland has 
promised to earmark half of German aid (out of the global sum of 
120 million DM) for the purchase of equipment in Germany. 
  German firms, however, offered equipment which is on average 
twice as expensive as that offered by other suppliers. The 
delegation pointed to that fact during the present talks. The 
German Interior Ministry is entitled to buy equipment from 
German producers at reduced prices and the Polish delegation 
asked the Germans to buy the equipment for Poland on the same 
principles. 
  It cannot be ruled out that the two documents, that is the 
technical protocol on readmission of people arriving in Germany 
via Poland and the agreement on cooperation of the police and 
customs services of Poland and Germany, will be ready for 
signing in spring 1994. The second round of talks on the matter 
is scheduled to be held in Warsaw in a few weeks time.

  [Text] Bonn -- Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free 
Democratic Party of Germany) has called on the parties to the 
wage negotiations to reduce wages for less qualified work. A 
low-wage sector might contribute to reducing high unemployment 
in Germany, Rexrodt stated in Bonn today. It is not a question 
of taking away something from those who have low incomes but of 
improving the opportunities for those who have no jobs. Low 
wages in certain spheres might be an initial step. 
  "In the long run, the current unemployment level is 
unacceptable," Rexrodt stressed. He referred to U.S. 
experiences. A total of 36 million jobs have been created there 
in the low-wage sphere in the past 11 years. In Europe, the 
number was only 8 million, despite the larger population. 
  Distributing work in a different way, as demanded by the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany, is a naive proposal. The 
unemployment problem can only be solved if the labor market 
becomes more flexible. In the future, working hours will have 
to be adapted to the individual needs and requirements of the 
enterprises. Flexible wage agreements are necessary to achieve 
that. If the system of area wage contracts is maintained, a 
"wide margin for individual company regulations" must be offered. 
  Rexrodt described the planned permission for private 
employment agencies a "mosaic stone in creating a more flexible 
labor market." Small private employment agencies will be able to 
fulfill the task more efficiently than the labor offices of the 
large Federal Employment Office. The advantage of private 
agencies is that they "know the people and the enterprises round 
the corner." 
  A poll carried out by the Chamber of Industry and Trade in 
Koblenz among enterprises in this region, which the chamber and 
Rexrodt presented jointly, revealed that about three-quarters of 
the companies polled would use private employment agencies. 
  Of the 2,700 enterprises that received questionnaires, 
approximately 1,400 replied. Two-thirds stated that their needs 
have never or seldom been covered by the labor offices. Larger 
enterprises were a little less dissatisfied than smaller ones. 
The majority of companies would also be willing to pay up to 
three monthly salaries for private employment agencies, the 
executive manager of the Koblenz Chamber of Trade and Industry, 
Hans-Juergen Podzun, stressed. The price will be determined by 
the market.

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, 
Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], sees essential common 
points with the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in 
foreign policy. In an interview with NEUE PRESSE (Friday [11 
March] edition), which is published in Hannover, the foreign 
minister stated that "it is correct: There are essential points 
in foreign policy where we are indeed in complete agreement with 
the SPD." Kinkel cited European policy as an example. 
  However, the controversy about international Bundeswehr 
missions is an absolutely central issue that threatens to harm 
Germany because of the SPD blockade, the FDP politician said. 
There, the SPD must "bring itself to change course." Even a 
clarifying ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court does not 
release "the SPD from its share of responsibility for finding a 
political solution for the necessary amendment to the Basic Law 
regarding Bundeswehr missions." Germany has every reason to 
strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization, 
personnel, and finances, Kinkel said. 
  (The interview was prereleased to DPA in an editorial 
version).

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After months of intensive 
negotiations, the coalition and the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] on Thursday [10 March] agreed on the introduction 
of nursing care insurance and its financing to compensate for 
the costs of employers. After several hours of tallks with 
Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union Bundestag group, SPD Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping said that domestic nursing care will be 
introduced on 1 April 1995 and in-patient nursing care on 1 July 
1996. 
  Contributions of 1 percent are to be collected as of 1 
January 1995. In the representation of Rhineland-Palatinate in 
Bonn, Scharping said he hopes that the mediation committee will 
agree to the result. The Social Democrats will agree to the 
abolition of one holiday. An exemption was explicitly defined: 
Should one land not abolish one holiday, the employer would 
have to completely take over all contributions. 
  Moreover, according to Scharping, it was further agreed that 
in the course of next year, the Bundestag and the Bundesrat will 
examine what has become of this provision in order to draw 
legislative conclusions if necessary. "It is important the 
laender are now free to consider the whole year what holiday 
they want to cancel," Scharping said. The agreement that has 
been achieved will result in a considerable improvement for the 
affected people. The compromise contains all Social Democratic 
ideas about nursing care benefits, including domestic and 
in-patient care, he said.

  [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- On Thursday [10 March], the 
employers described the mediating committee's resolution on 
nursing-care insurance as "the most severely wrong decision in 
decades." Even now, because of the excessive social costs, the 
introduction of additional social insurance to be financed 
through compensation by employers and employees alike is 
economically unacceptable, they said in a first reaction in 
Cologne. It will be "fatal for the labor market." Moreover, 
additional burdens would be shifted onto future generations that 
will be impossible to bear in view of demographic developments. 
  "Thinking in terms of political prestige rather than 
economic 
reason has been the decisive factor," the Federal Association of 
German Employers Associations said in its first comment on the 
Bonn resolution. What is particularly disappointing is that, 
with the agreement on compensation, the firm promise has not 
been honored to define bindingly in advance the compensation for 
employers' contributions for the second stage, too. "Since 
industry and labor in the major economic areas are making a 
considerable contribution to the protection of Germany as an 
economic center, these efforts are now being undermined by the 
state's social policy."

Europe Has Awakened'"] 
  [Text] Bari, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- When the European states some 
days ago called for a NATO intervention in Bosnia, Italian 
Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri today said he felt relief that 
Europe had at last awakened. 
  Taking part in a debate here Thursday [10 March] evening, 
Fabbri said he would not want it said in years to come that 
Europe had been guilty of appeasement when faced with a 
situation in the former Yugoslavia that smacked of the Middle 
Ages and of the Nazi Holocaust, and the minister reiterated 
Italy's readiness to send soldiers into Bosnia if the United 
Nations advanced such a request and if all the factions in the 
field agreed. For the moment, however, no such official request 
had been forthcoming, he noted. 
  Fabbri said that the firmer stance taken by Europe had eased 
the stranglehold on Sarajevo and halted the massacres underway 
there and he was confident that peace prospects had been 
enhanced. 
  Asked about possible reprisal action against bases on 
Italian 
soil, the defense minister said that the allied forces were able 
to moniter both naval and air space and to throw up a virtually 
impenetrable shield if the need arises. There is always a risk 
of terrorist attacks but security has been bolstered at all the 
bases, he added.

  [Text] Bari, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- The end of the Cold War and 
the balance of terror has multiplied the number of hotspots in 
the world and therefore a western foreign policy must be 
maintained, while hanging on to the role of NATO, according to 
Italian Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri Thursday [10 March]. 
  Addressing a meeting here on Puglia, Land of Peace Facing 
the 
East, Fabbri recalled the withdrawal today of Italian soldiers 
from Mogadishu and the meager results obtained in Somalia, in 
part because a plethora of contingents were sent in that had 
never before worked together, he said. For him, the only 
organization capable of carrying out a pacification effort and 
of implementing United Nations' decisions was NATO, whose role, 
he insisted, had certainly not ended with the end of the Warsaw 
Pact. 
  Within the general framework, Italian action must be 
developed with regard to the following three scenarios to the 
east: Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean area, 
and the Middle East. 
  The minister lauded "the extraordinary commitment" of 
Italian 
Armed Forces in peacekeeping missions abroad and specifically 
mentioned the success of the missions in Mozambique and in 
Albania. He also recalled the ten Italian soldiers who died in 
the Horn of Africa.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bosnia/Vatican: Pope Praises the UN </F>
Protection Force"] 
  [Text] Vatican City, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- Pope John Paul II 
today praised the work being done by United Nations forces in 
Bosnia and solemnly reaffirmed the Holy See's pledge to do 
whatever was in its power to encourage the search for peace with 
respect for the people themselves, and for their family, social 
and religious life. 
  The occasion for these remarks today was the pope's meeting 
here with a group of soldiers from a Canadian regiment on its 
way home from a stint in Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping 
force. 
  The pope said he wished to underscore his great esteem for 
the UN forces from diverse nations which are helping to limit, 
despite extremely difficult conditions, the fighting underway in 
Bosnia and who are doing everything possible to move that 
country closer to peace. 
  The pontiff praised their perseverance and dedication in 
serving as "efficient agents of international solidarity." 
  He told the Canadians that their presence had allowed 
humanitarian aid to reach populations which had been reduced, 
"through interminable sieges and fighting," to living under 
material and psychological conditions pushed to the very limits 
of what is humanly bearable. 
  Without the presence in Bosnia of United Nations forces, the 
situation in that war-torn land would be even more tragic than 
it is already, the pope concluded.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Budget Minister on Growth Figures, </F>
Interest Rates"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- Budget Minister Luigi 
Spaventa on Thursday [10 March] conceded that growth this year 
will be lower than forecasts made a few months ago but said he 
was encouraged by optimistic figures released yesterday by the 
private employers' association, Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry]. 
  "It is a certain fact" that growth will be lower than 
expected in 1994, Spaventa said on the sidelines of a conference 
here, but if gross domestic product does increase even by just 
1.4 percent, as predicted by Confindustria, it would be a 
"consistent" improvement and would "produce noticeable effects." 
  Spaventa appeared wary of comments by International Monetary 
Fund officials, who said the government will be forced to 
approve additional austerity measures in spring to offset a 
runaway deficit. "I am against so-called clinical measures aimed 
at patching up the differences in forecast growth caused by 
international economic cycles," Spaventa said. 
  He admitted that "the last word will be up to the IMF," 
which 
will probably recommend new measures to contain spending and 
possibly some indirect tax increases. 
  But interest rates are the key to balancing state finances, 
according to Spaventa: "The battle against the public debt will 
be fought with interest rates," he said. 
  As for the effects in Italy of recovery in other countries, 
Spaventa said he was pleased to see that the German central bank 
had not increased interest rates along with growing monetary 
mass; "in the past they would not have hesitated to do so."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italian Investments Abroad Booming, </F>
National Council for Economy and Labor Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- The recent Italian export 
boom has been accompanied by a surge in investments in emerging 
markets, especially by small and medium firms, the economics and 
labour institute CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] 
reported today. 
  According to a CNEL study, Italian firms with foreign 
shareholdings leapt from 270 to 350 in the two years from 1992 
to 1993. Most of the 80 newcomers were small and medium firms, 
while big groups, with the exception of IFI [Italian Financial 
Institute]-Fiat, did not raise investments in this period, or 
even disinvested. "The lead role played by small and medium 
firms is proof of the vitality of the system, as Italian 
investments abroad appear to complement rather than replace 
exports," CNEL said. 
  One other figure highlighted by the study was the ratio of 
Italian shareholdings abroad with those of foreign firms in 
Italy. Until 1992 this was about even in terms of staff employed 
in the companies concerned. But in 1992-93 it rose by 150,000 
employees for the 350 Italian-funded business abroad, compared 
to 50,000 for the 150 foreign firms in Italy. 
  As for the markets where the new Italian money is heading, 
CNEL highlighted Eastern Europe, with its high development 
potential and low cost of labour, followed by various areas in 
the Far East, especially China. Investments to the European 
Community (now Union) and North America fell proportionally in 
the two years. 
  The study also found a marked drop in foreign investments in 
Italy between 1989 (176 firms) and 1992, with just 68 firms with 
some or all foreign capital (foreign investors in fact prefer 
takeovers, the study said). But there was a slight recovery 
last year, to 84 firms. 
  CNEL said the devaluation of the lira, which might have been 
expected to generate an influx of foreign money, instead had 
little effect, "raising the need for a policy that can stimulate 
and develop the presence of multinationals in Italy, especially 
in the areas of the South which, with just 16 percent of the 
total, continue to receive a modest quota of total investment." 
  CNEL stigmatized a perceived tendency to exclude foreign 
firms from privatisation sell-offs as the fruit of "creeping 
nationalism and also possible interests against competition." 
It said this tendency must be rooted out if Italy is to have 
"efficient ownership solutions that will raise international 
competitiveness."

<F P=106> [Article by Vittorio Malagutti: "That Airport Is Cosa </F>
Nostra"] 
  [Text] The Mafia and banks. A bridge between Sicily and 
the Antilles. A 50-billion-lire loan on a phantom contract in 
the Caribbean. Thus, Montepaschi [the Monte dei Paschi di Siena 
banking group] lent a helping hand to a dubious enterprise. With 
no guaranty and... 
  He was an untouchable. A businessman feared and respected by 
everyone, beginning with politicians, bankers, and magistrates, 
on both sides of the Atlantic, in Italy, in the Antilles, in 
Venezuela, and in the United States. Over a period of more than 
20 years, Rosario Spadaro, a Sicilian from Messina, Saro to his 
friends, had built himself a fortune: casinos, hotels, tourist 
centers, a small air fleet. All of this at Saint Martin, a small 
Dutch West Indies island where he had settled in 1979. 
  A few weeks ago, the 60-year-old Spadaro reached his 
high-flying journey's end. A police boat patrol boarded his 
yacht off the Antilles and the Messina-born entrepreneur ended 
up in handcuffs. The Dutch magistrature has opened an inquiry on 
Spadaro and his activities. But the Italian magistrates also 
have many questions for him. Last September, in Messina, a pool 
of investigators conducting an inquiry into an international 
arms traffic operation served him with due notice of 
investigation. The charges: Criminal association and corruption. 
Spadaro has long been suspected of ties with the Mafia. The 
Sicilian businessman who had settled in the Antilles was well 
acquainted with Nino Salvo, Cosa Nostra's collector, who was 
killed in an ambush in September 1992. Spadaro also had ties 
with Gaetano Corallo and Ilario Legnaro, Catania boss Nitto 
Santapaola's lieutenants, who, on several occasions, like Salvo, 
had visited Saint Martin, a tourist paradise that has always 
been deemed a perfect island for laundering dirty money. Thus, 
Spadaro, who has always proclaimed himself to be simply an 
"honest and rich Sicilian," ended up in the sights of the 
Italian magistrates. 
<H5>  Mafia of the Casinos </H5>
  In 1985, Spadaro was questioned by Milanese Magistrate Paolo 
Arbasino, who was conducting an inquiry on the mafia of the 
casinos. Meanwhile, Giovanni Falcone was investigating ties 
between Messina-born entrepreneur Spadaro and Catania-born 
builder Gaetano Graci. But Spadaro's recent arrest brings 
another event into the spotlight. A story as complicated as it 
is mysterious, that, four years ago, triggered the investigation 
of the Antimafia High Commission. The Commission was headed at 
that time by Domenico Sica. It all started with a $40 million 
(over 60 billion lire) public-works contract for the expansion 
of Saint Martin's airport, a deal in which Spadaro and his 
friend Vincenzo Bertucci, a consultant of Calabrian origin, 
based in Rome, were actively involved. There was talk of 
kickbacks and mafia ties. 
  Several wiretaps revealed that Spadaro associated with 
Claudio Ciampi, an official of the BNL [National Bank of Labor] 
in New York and son of Italy's present prime minister, who at 
that time was the governor of the Bank of Italy. The inquiry 
ended up buried under proclamations of innocence by those under 
suspicion, and polemics regarding the wiretaps ordered by Sica. 
In the wake of the Tangentopoli [Bribe City] cyclone, however, 
that episode has now resurfaced. In addition to Spadaro, 
Bertucci has also had trouble with the law. His name has now 
joined the other names in the caldron of those under 
investigation in connection with the SACE [Export Credit 
Insurance Agency] scandal. 
  But there is more. The documents that IL MONDO has been able 
to examine show that the contract for the Saint Martin airport 
was financed by the ICLE [National Credit Institute for Italian 
Works Abroad], which is controlled by the Monte dei Paschi di 
Siena banking group. To the ICLE, operations like the Saint 
Martin one were not new. From the investigation of the SACE 
being conducted by the Rome magistrature, the fact emerges that 
the Monte dei Paschi group's ICLE, which merged last year with 
Mediocredito Toscano, played a central role in the financing of 
many works projects for small Caribbean republics. For example, 
ICLE had strong ties with Spartaco Ghini, the recently bankrupt 
Perugia-based builder accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. Ghini 
was very active in the Caribbean where his enterprises operated 
for years building hotels and tourist centers, always covered by 
SACE policies. Among other things, Ghini too had chosen Bertucci 
as his trusted consultant for these operations. In Saint Martin, 
however, Bertucci had applied his efforts to favoring Spadaro's 
friends. But, for ICLE, the airport operation proved a disaster. 
Actually, work under the project, initially awarded to the 
Messina-based C&amp;D Construction Company, never even got 
started. 
In 1990, a year after the signing of the contract, Saint 
Martin's governor revoked the work order. Result: The first 
tranche of the financing disbursed by ICLE, in the amount of 
$13.5 million or almost 20 billion lire, became an uncollectible 
debt. 
  Meanwhile, ICLE had paid $175,000 (over 250 million lire) to 
a Panamanian company, Spantax Holding. The identity of the real 
beneficiaries of this sum, paid out as a brokerage commission, 
remains a mystery. In order to reconstruct the succession of 
events it is necessary to take a step backward in time, and 
specifically, to the summer of 1989, when a Saint Martin 
government delegation landed in Catania. It was met by Bertucci, 
by Spadaro's son, and by representatives of builder Graci. The 
same delegation also visited ICLE in Rome. On that occasion, the 
final details of the agreement were ironed out. 
  The ICLE, which had joined the orbit of the Monte dei Paschi 
group a short time before, undertook to finance the airport 
construction project in the amount of $35 million. The operation 
was shepherded for ICLE, whose general manager was then Cesare 
Brogi, by Raffaele Gambardella, one of its high officials and 
member of the Christian Democratic Party (for as long as the 
party existed). Destined for a successful career, he is 
currently the general manager of SIMEST, the state financial 
intermediary for support of joint ventures abroad. Bertucci, 
with his Exen, a Rome-based service company, acted as the 
middleman. Bertucci being, as he was, in a position to vaunt his 
first-rate relations with the top officials of ICLE as well as 
those of SACE and of the Foreign Trade Ministry, his presence in 
the deal was by no means a casual one. 
  The contract signed, the project was initially awarded to a 
small Messina enterprise, the C&amp;D Construction Company, with 
a 
capital of only 60 million lire. The company was run by an 
engineer from Messina, Roberto Caligiore, but, according to 
wiretaps conducted four years ago by Sica's investigators, half 
the company's capital was in the name of Spadaro's wife. After a 
few weeks, C&amp;D formed an ad hoc consortium, the Juliana 
Airport 
Consortium. For this purpose, C&amp;D allied itself with AICO, 
another small construction company, headed by a certain Ugo 
Tortella. Caligiore and Tortella, together with Manlio Bertucci, 
brother of Vincenzo, were members of the board of directors of 
the consortium, 15 percent of which was controlled by AICO. This 
share was later increased to 25 percent. 
  On paper, work was to have started during the first months 
of 1990. ICLE did its part, disbursing the first tranche of the 
loan, $13.5 million. The disbursement was cashed directly by the 
Italian consortium as a down payment on the project. But on the 
other side of the ocean there had been a change of mind. Via a 
letter dated 15 November 1990, the Princess Juliana 
International Airport, the client public-sector company in the 
deal, notified the ICLE that it had no intention of honoring the 
contract initialed the year before. The Antilles airport 
company's board of directors had changed since then and the new 
board members, according to their statements, had discovered 
numerous irregularities in the agreement with the ICLE. Cited 
among these was the fact that Bertucci's Exen had furnished 
erroneous data on the volume of the work involved. "In the 
course of the investigation," the 15 November letter states, 
"the board of directors has further found that ICLE has made 
payments totaling $13.5 million to the Juliana Airport 
Consortium. Let it be understood that in the future the airport 
cannot assume any responsibility with respect to these 
payments." This amounted to saying that the Antilles government 
had no intention of paying for the work order, which it deemed 
irregular. 
  In a subsequent letter, dated 6 December 1990, Saint 
Martin's 
representative stated that ICLE had authorized the loan without 
seeking any information on the financial solidity of the 
borrower company. A peculiar proceeding, to say the least. ICLE, 
through its attorneys, formally challenged all the accusations, 
but to no avail. The contract was broken and the work order 
revoked. The Princess Juliana Airport Consortium remained de 
facto a phantom company. A phantom that had walked away with 
$13.5 million. Without having done anything.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Electorate as Varied as `a </F>
Harlequin's Suit,' Study Says"] 
  [Text] Rome, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- The results of Italy's first 
first-past-the-post general elections on March 27-28 may be 
affected to an unquantifiable degree by the variegated make-up 
of the newly drawn-up electoral colleges, which often transcends 
the traditional North-South split, according to a study of the 
electorate in the new single-member constituencies. 
  The pattern of electors that emerged from the survey by CNEL 
[National Council for Economy and Labor], Unioncamere, and the 
Tagliacarne Institute was likened to "a harlequin's suit" by 
CNEL's Chairman, Giuseppe De Rita, presenting the results 
yesterday. 
  The survey looked at criteria such as age, employment 
levels, 
and the number of businesses in order to gain an overall 
impression of the economic and social make-up of each of the 707 
constituencies. 
  For the Lower House ballot, which will assign 475 of 630 
seats, the survey found that 12 per cent of the population live 
in areas of "weak" economic power; 40 per cent live in areas of 
"semi-weak" economic power; 33 percent in "semi-strong" areas; 
15 per cent in "strong" areas. 
  Instead of reinforcing the traditional divide between North 
and South Italy, the results exposed numerous "marked 
differences found in the constituencies within each region." 
  The first three positions of the strongest socio-economic 
category are occupied by constituencies in Lombardy, but eight 
other Lombard areas are to be found in the "semi-weak" category. 
Alongside Lombardy in the top five is Emilia-Romagna. 
  Although the lower economic categories are still occupied 
almost totally by the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily, 
three constituencies in Campania have a "semi-strong" economic 
strength, the study showed. 
  The poorest zone of all Italy is that north of Aversa, in 
Campania. 
  De Rita, commenting on the findings, stressed that their 
importance must not be over-exaggerated. Despite declaring 
himself to be "an old proportionalist," he said that the 
first-past-the-post system, voted for by 85 percent of Italians 
in last April's referendum, "will enable a new political class 
at a general as well as at a local level" to come into being.

<F P=106> ["F.V." report: "Democratic Party of the Left Formula: </F>
Caretaker Government"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- "They say that they find their accord 
with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi constrictive; they say 
that they want to free themselves from Berlusconi's deadly 
embrace, that they want to reenter the game; they are sending 
out signals. But on what bases could an agreement between the 
League and the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] be formed? At 
the very most, after the elections, if the progressive forces 
fail to win, there would be an agreement with Martinazzoli's 
Popular Party [PPI]." Franco Bassanini swore that for the 
present the PDS is not thinking about a constituent government 
at all, "because we do not want it and because the conditions 
for forming one do not exist. In any case, there is no question 
of our joining with [Northern League Secretary] Bossi." So the 
PDS is rejecting the solicitations from the League which, behind 
its official statements, seems prepared to govern "with the 
devil himself" as long as it can get rid of Berlusconi and have 
its hands free again. 
  Thus the League's harsh voice became mellifluous when 
[League 
ideologist] Miglio addressed [PDS Secretary] Occhetto on the 
subject of federalism, when the mayor of Varese said in 
Strasbourg that "the League is willing to engage in dialogue 
with the left if it embraces the idea of local government," when 
[League lower house floor leader] Maroni spoke about an 
"institutional government" in the event of none of the 
alignments gaining a victory on 27 March -- that is, a 
government that will enable parliament to further modify the 
ground rules, to complete the "restyling" of the Constitution, 
and to restore decisionmaking power to the country. In fact, 
the League is not alone in thinking this way. [Pact for Italy 
leader] Segni too believes that "unless a majority capable of 
producing an executive is formed after the elections, the only 
remaining path will be an institutional government." This is 
perfectly consistent with Martinazzoli's thinking (he introduced 
the idea within the context of the political debate) and with 
[Senate speaker] Spadolini (who originated the idea). 
  But Occhetto does not seem to be allowing himself to be led 
astray by the sirens, is attacking "the brokers of the old 
politics" who "have set to work recently," and said that he does 
not like such formulas as the "institutional government" or the 
"constituent government." The PDS secretary expressed his 
"amazement" that there are those who are aiming to "dispossess" 
people of their votes and thus to recycle the old way of 
conducting politics. Let the voters decide, Occhetto is saying, 
though he too has his own "formulas" and his own kind of 
government, which he calls the government "of national 
reconstruction" or the "caretaker" government. On what kind of 
majority would it rest if the progressive pole fails to achieve 
an absolute majority? The PDS secretary did not explain this 
openly, but when he says that the left will never join "with the 
three cronies of the right" -- Berlusconi, [National Alliance 
leader] Fini, and Bossi -- that leaves only the Pact and the PPI. 
  To protect himself against charges of consociationism, 
Occhetto specified that "to rebuild is a national necessity, not 
the same old sham of the old politics of consociation." Of 
course, in an election campaign every alignment will say that it 
is sure of victory: The Left is doing so, the Right is doing 
so, and even the center is trying to do so. But it is equally 
clear that some major maneuverings are being planned. And while 
the League is doing so brazenly, the PDS and the center are 
trying to avoid making it explicit, while on the Right only the 
CCD [Christian Democratic Center] still professes its faith in 
Berlusconi. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Valencian Premier Joan Lerma by Luis R. </F>
Aizpeolea in Valencia; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Aizpeolea] Do you not 
believe the key to the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] is 
the breakup of the Gonzalez-Guerra tandem? 
  [Lerma] It is a reductionist key. Spain has changed a great 
deal, and the most important thing is that the model of 
exercising power went into crisis with the Spain of the 
autonomous communities. Decisions can no longer be made from a 
single place. There are also new social groups involved. There 
is women's participation. The problem which arises is that as 
the democratization process advances, the parties are trying to 
centralize it more. This is the case with the People's Party. 
We are approaching more the modern model of acknowledging 
diversity. 
  [Aizpeolea] But Guerra divides the PSOE into Socialists and 
social liberals... 
  [Lerma] Everybody tends to classify things in terms of what 
he upholds. There cannot be so much reductionism. These years 
will be years of the triumph of diversity and tolerance. The 
right-left division must be qualified with new elements. It is 
not left-wing to believe that power must be completely 
centralized or to make a nonparticipatory model. It is 
left-wing to democratize power to the utmost. 
  [Aizpeolea] Do you not recognize Guerra as the left? 
  [Lerma] Many people view Alfonso Guerra as a model of the 
left, but Guerra does not have a monopoly on this model. On 
some things, such as his criticisms of the right, it is easy to 
agree. On others, it is not easy. It is very important for the 
left not to be exclusive and for nobody to have a monopoly on 
the left. 
  [Aizpeolea] So what are the differences between renewalists 
and Guerraists? Is it a power struggle? 
  [Lerma] It is not just a matter of a power struggle. This 
is a left-wing party all in all, and if there are social 
liberals, they are very few. The differences are in priorities. 
The complexity in the party is that of the end of the 20th 
century, when there are economic demands and others which are 
not, such as women's emancipation, the environment, 
self-fulfillment, and the defense of freedoms. The party cannot 
uphold an economic model alone. Integration means combining the 
two things. 
  [Aizpeolea] Are you in favor of a Gonzalez-Guerra agreement? 
  [Lerma] The secretary general is the man responsible for 
forming the Executive Committee, and he must do so in accordance 
with the aspirations of the grassroots. Nobody can dispute 
this, but the congress has the responsibility of endorsing it. 
It is necessary to talk to everybody and formulate a majority 
program. I approve of Guerra's being on it, because the 
Executive Committee should be open. 
  [Aizpeolea] What is your opinion of the terms of balance and 
political weight set by Guerra? 
  [Lerma] They are not terms. They are matters of common 
sense. 
  [Aizpeolea] But it is to be deduced from his terms that his 
group of close associates should be on the Executive Committee. 
  [Lerma] The presence of this person or that does not shape 
the Executive Committee's outlook. I have no objection to their 
all staying on. I have an excellent relationship with them; 
they have worked, and I approve of their being recognized. 
  [Aizpeolea] Could not the image of renewal be eroded by 
the aforementioned group's presence? 
  [Lerma] A considerable amount of renewal must be introduced, 
but I do not believe that the amount will be affected by four or 
five people out of 33. The key to an Executive Committee is not 
its specific role but it ability to formulate specific 
renovating proposals. The people make the post. 
  [Aizpeolea] Who should predominate in the new Executive 
Committee? Renewalists? Guerraists? 
  [Lerma] New faces in order to tackle new problems. It seems 
to me very important that the new faces be in the majority. 
Neither Guerraists nor old-style renewalists. We should not be 
timid in this. 
  [Aizpeolea] What characterizes the so-called integrationists 
whom you represent? 
  [Lerma] We wish to represent a major renewal in the left's 
thinking -- a new model of social contract. Let decent 
pensions, public health, and education be maintained, through an 
economic policy proposal similar to the Delors plan (Jacques 
Delors is the European Commission president). We will also 
advocate a different way of exercising power. The freedoms 
policy should have a more preponderant role in the Socialist 
government's policy. We should not allow anybody to take the 
flag of freedoms from us. We have placed too much emphasis on 
the antiterrorist policy and the order policy, and this has been 
very closely linked to a certain minister's personality. 
  [Aizpeolea] Alfonso Guerra says that there is no longer talk 
of Spain. 
  [Lerma] This is a short-term and undramatic situation. We 
have witnessed a process of everybody's being taken back to his 
territory, in which everybody speaks of his own affairs, but 
this is unreal, because we are all interconnected and linked to 
Spain and the European Union. We must find a formula for 
integration in order to end these strains. People will not 
speak of Spain if it is an exclusive idea of its nature. In 
order to integrate, it is necessary to speak of Spain as being 
diverse and plural, as everybody's common heritage -- a diverse, 
plural, and nonuniform Spain. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Date for Membership Can Be Observed"] </F>
  [Excerpts] In statements on the European Union [EU] to the 
Bundesrat on Thursday [10 March], Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and 
Foreign Minister Alois Mock both expressed optimism that the EU 
will reach agreement on the issue of the blocking minority and 
that the EU schedule can be maintained with 1 January 1995 as 
the date for accession. In political terms, the traffic lights 
on the road to a common Europe have been showing "green" for 
Austria since 1 March. 
  "I am going on the assumption," Mock said, "that in the next 
few days it will be possible to formalize the membership 
negotiations." In their statements Vranitzky and Mock briefed 
the Bundesrat about the conclusion of the negotiations about 
Austria's EU membership. For Vranitzky the result of the 
negotiations is "certainly something that can be shown proudly" 
at home and abroad. He stressed that during the intensive 
discussions over the next weeks and months until the referendum, 
it will also be pointed out "that in some small, definable 
fields it will be necessary to make adjustments." Some people 
see this as a disadvantage. However, with a view to 
safeguarding the future, this is not a disadvantage. 
  Vranitzky also pointed out that our eastern neighboring 
countries are already "knocking" on the EU's door. This refutes 
the argument that Austria wants to join a European "fortress." 
The EU is not a "fortress" but the "core" of the process of 
European unification. 
  The foreign minister, too, stressed that "we have achieved 
an 
overall result that we can present to the Austrian people for 
the referendum with a clear conscience." The result of the 
negotiations shows "that we are moving along the path toward a 
common Europe with self-confidence." Austria now has the 
opportunity to join an EU in which peace and security are not 
empty utopias and which offers the concrete hope that national 
wars between its members will become impossible. "We simply 
must not miss the historic opportunity to belong to such a 
union," Mock stressed. 
  At a press conference on Thursday Nationalrat President 
Heinz 
Fischer cited three constitutional requirements for joining the 
EU, which is to form the basis for the EU referendum. The law is 
to contain a "clear constitutional authorization" for the state 
organs to ratify the EU accession. Furthermore, it is to 
facilitate a clear yes or no in the referendum and to define the 
contents of the EU treaty exactly. As a date for the 
referendum, 12 June has "great appeal" for Fischer, because that 
is the day on which the elections to the European Parliament 
will be held. However, the deadlines for 12 June are very tight 
and thus 19 June is more likely. 
  According to Fischer the Federal Constitutional Law on 
joining the EU is to be brief and precise. A clear definition 
of the contents of the treaty will render it legally impossible 
for any kind of changes are made in the text of the treaty after 
the referendum. Fischer called the accusation by Freedom Party 
of Austria Chairman Joerg Haider that the government might 
present a "fraudulent package" as a "politically unfair 
insinuation." [passage omitted] 
  Heinz Fischer also commented on the internal EU discussion 
about the question of the blocking minority for votes in the 
Nationalrat of the expanded EU. Since it is, in particular, 
Spain that is blocking a decision on this issue, Fischer 
appealed to those responsible in Madrid not to turn this problem 
into a stumbling block for the accession of strong new members, 
which is also very important for the EU. Fischer expressed 
optimism that this conflict will be solved in time so that the 
EU schedule will not be endangered. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Richardt Vork, head of the customs </F>
investigation troop "Sanctions Assistance Mission" is 
responsible for the UN embargo against Serbia, by unidentified 
correspondent in Vienna; date not given: "Mafia-Like 
Structures"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Your international investigation 
troop "Sanctions Assistance Mission" (SAM) has been controlling 
the embargo against the Serbs since 5 October 1992. How do are 
you proceeding? 
  [Vork] Our people -- a total of 240 men from over 20 states 
-- have been positioned at all important border crossings into 
Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM], Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine. They monitor 
all deliveries to and from Serbia and Montenegro. In 19 months, 
we have discovered several thousand violations of the embargo. 
  [Correspondent] Who breaks the embargo most frequently? 
  [Vork] The large European states are mostly involved because 
the majority of businesses with Serbian participation are 
located in Germany or Italy. Many of them claim to have 
subsidiaries in FYROM. Our investigations usually reveal two 
things: Either these businesses do not exist, which means that 
they have been invented by criminals. Or the business exists, 
but it never issued the consignment documents. 
  [Correspondent] This applies to the export of goods from 
Serbia. What about imports? 
  [Vork] Since the adoption of UN Resolution 820... 
  [Correspondent] ...which was adopted in May 1993 and also 
bans the transit of goods through Serbia... 
  [Vork] ...the number of attempts to import goods has 
declined. Yet the number is still very high. In addition, false 
UN documents are being used. Instead of applying for permits 
with the Sanctions Committee in New York, perfect fakes are 
used. The biggest problem continues to be attempts to smuggle 
crude oil into the country. 
  [Correspondent] You are facing strong criticism because 
ships on the Danube have succeeded to this very day in smuggling 
tanker-loads of oil products on the Danube before the eyes of 
the controllers. 
  [Vork] It is right that there are logistic shortcomings. 
The Romanian customs authorities, for example, had no fast 
boat. We have now acquired one, but we cannot be everywhere at 
the same time. In the Black Sea, a Ukrainian 5,000-tonne steamer 
recently ignored all requests to stop. A Bulgarian warship 
finally stopped it. The ship wanted to unload oil for the Serbs 
at a small Romanian port. The local authorities decide whether 
ships are stopped or not. 
  [Correspondent] What is coming from other directions, that 
is from West Europe? 
  [Vork] Things are easier for us on the Danube in Hungary. 
Road crossings are being monitored tightly. For this reason, 
violations are increasing in the Adriatic Sea. Ships appearing 
on the radar screen claim that their crude oil is destined for 
Croatian enterprises. We then contact the ports of Rijeka or 
Koper and ascertain whether the company mentioned really exists. 
A few days ago, we sent back another 85,000-tonne oil tanker in 
cooperation with NATO warships. 
  [Correspondent] Let me ask you a question about deals with 
third countries. It is well known that Serbian enterprises are 
operating under cover everywhere in East Europe. With the 
proceeds earned from these trade activities, the headquarters in 
Belgrade buys goods in the international black market. 
  [Vork] Things like that happen even in Vienna. A Swiss 
company may act as the agent of an enterprise in Kiev, for 
example, which is known to belong to a Serb. The financial 
transaction takes place in Vienna. Completely new mafia-like 
structures are developing in the East. Frequently, these 
criminals are armed. 
  [Correspondent] Are Austrians involved in the smuggling 
activities? 
  [Vork] A total of 224 violations on the part of Austrian 
companies have been registered. Of an overall number of 5,855 
cases, 1,600 violations alone have been committed by the FYROM. 
Over 600 infringements have been carried out by 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, and Germany.

<F P=106> ["Telephone" interview with Federal Chancellor Franz </F>
Vranitzky by Klaus Edlinger, in the studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Edlinger] You have heard the news that the U.S. 
Exim Bank has approved the credit for the completion of the 
Czech nuclear power plant at Temelin. Are you surprised, 
disappointed? 
  [Vranitzky] There was some indication that our objections 
had been taken into account and that guarantees would not be 
provided so easily. I am certainly disappointed. 
  [Edlinger] Do you think that the federal government's 
efforts were sufficient or that, maybe, you started your 
activities in the United States too late? 
  [Vranitzky] This argument has long since been settled and it 
was refuted by all those who were there. So that is not 
relevant. The point probably was that the U.S. side was less 
interested in Austria's position and gave precedence to 
considerations of economic and industrial policy, which were 
more important for the Americans than our justified objections. 
  [Edlinger] Will you continue the struggle or will you simply 
accept the decision? 
  [Vranitzky] As far as I can see there is not much we can do 
about this decision. Still, I do not yet know the arguments 
used in favor of the credit. Still, it has been partly the 
result of our efforts that future nuclear projects will be 
subjected to stricter examination standards. Therefore -- and I 
have always said that -- in the future we will not sever any 
relations but maintain a dialogue on energy -- with the Czech 
Republic and others. Still, our basic position has not changed. 
Even when we do not have to hide our disappointment now, our 
arguments led to a rethinking process and to reflection on the 
part of many Americans. 
  [Edlinger] Thank you very much for the interview, 
chancellor. 
  [Vranitzky] Not at all.

<F P=106> [Report by Hannes Reichmann: "The Serbian Sleepers"] </F>
  [Text] When Ljubisa Ristic enters the "Halali" restaurant 
in Vienna's First District, which is famous for its game 
specialities, the waiters and even the owner himself still hurry 
to respectfully greet the "Director General." 
  "Tell them," Ristic encourages the owner with an expectant 
face, "how many people I used to bring here for lunch week after 
week." The owner is all too pleased to confirm the merchant's 
tales: "Sometimes there were 20, 25 people." However, even 
though the "Halali's" special room is still unofficially called 
"Combick room," the owner has been complaining about a dramatic 
loss in turnover for some time. 
  For Ljubisa Ristic, the 57-year-old boss of the Combick 
Foreign Trade Company, on the other hand, the term "turnover" is 
slowly turning into a foreign word, because since the beginning 
of last May the formerly powerful Vienna subsidiary of the 
nationalized Belgrade trading company General-Export (Genex) has 
not been permitted to transfer one single schilling. The 
impressive figures of the dramatic fall: During the last 
business year under normal conditions -- 1991 -- more than 2 
billion schillings went across the Combick accounts in Vienna. 
In the 400-square-meter office Rastic was master of 20 
employees, received delegations of visitors from all over East 
Europe, and prepared the founding of new companies to expand 
Vienna as a business location. 
<H5>  Bizarre Administrator of a Deceased's Estate </H5>
  Today the merchant from Belgrade, together with two 
secretaries and an accountant, holds the bizarre position of an 
administrator of the decedent's estate: One half of the office 
is already taken over by a subtenant. In order to pay the 
monthly fixed costs, which have shrunk to a fraction of the 
former amounts, he needs approval from the Genex headquarters, 
because each day might be the last, as Ristic notes somberly: 
"We are just waiting for the 1993 balance sheet, then Belgrade 
will decide whether we close down." 
  His fate is shared by hundreds of companies all over 
Austria. 
It applies to trading companies, which used to juggle with 
goods of all kinds and with billions, just as to innumerable 
one-man companies and even shows an effect on a bank right here 
in Vienna. Since the UN Security Council -- as a result of the 
warmongering by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic -- imposed 
"comprehensive sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro" at the 
end of May 1992, they are all sliding into ruin in the most 
varied ways. 
  Last May, the absolute low point was reached, largely 
ignored 
by the public. A tightening of the UN embargo prohibits those 
Austrian companies, whose capital comes from mostly from Serbia, 
from also conducting so-called third-country business. However, 
it was exactly this third-country business that had been the 
last rescue for the Austro-Serbian businessmen after the 
introduction of the rigorous economic sanctions. Franz 
Brandsteidl, an official in the Economics Ministry who is 
responsible for making sure that the UN resolutions are 
observed, notes: "Companies operated by Serbs in Austria are 
moving to Russia with increasing frequency, where criminal 
organizations from the most varied countries are obviously 
establishing themselves." 
  This was precisely the development which the Austrian 
National Bank tried to counteract last May. A list of the 
National Bank, which is still kept under lock and key, lists a 
total of 28 companies which have been excluded from any kind of 
business for the past 10 months. The list contains practically 
everything that is renowned in the state-organized economic 
structure of the Belgrade regime: the Combick Trading Company 
of Ljubisa Ristic as well as the Inex Petrol AG oil company, the 
large Yugotours travel agency, or the Metal and Steel Trading 
Company (a subsidiary of Belgrade's Jugometal), which had a 
turnover of billions in the past. 
  "These 28 companies are clear cases," Friedrich Nowak of the 
National Bank's legal department argues. "In addition, there 
are hundreds of companies where the shareholders are private 
individuals. There we still have difficulties." Even Serbs or 
Montenegrins, the lawyer says, who are already Austrians but 
still have a Serbian passport, fall under the rigorous embargo. 
Nowak: "We constantly have problems with constructions where 
the shareholder is in Liechtenstein or in some other tax 
paradise and where there is the suspicion that Serbs are still 
the real owners." 
<H5>  The Specter of Smugglers </H5>
  Such merchants get only into real difficulties, when they 
meet the customs investigations teams of the "Sanctions 
Assistance Mission" (SAM) during their attempts to do illegal 
business. From the Brussels EU [European Union] Commission SAM 
has been watching the observation of the trade blockade for more 
than one and one-half year at all border checkpoints with Serbia 
and Montenegro: SAM teams inspect freighters at the Iron Gates 
in Romania as well as trucks at the Hungarian-Croatian border 
checkpoints. At the monthly routine meeting of SAM in Vienna 
last week, Richardt Vork, a native Dane, who is the head of SAM 
and thus the incarnate specter of all blockade breakers, 
described his experiences in drastic words: "Our inspectors are 
increasingly encountering armed smugglers." 
  Even though the prospects for success are rather low even 
for 
crisis-tested smugglers, the investigators have so far 
registered a total of 244 violations of the embargo in Austria. 
The colorful range of smuggled goods ranges from frozen fruit 
from Serbia to pharmaceutical primary products of a renowned 
Austrian producer, which were discovered during an attempt to 
import them into Serbia. In contrast, the number of cases 
pending in the courts remains surprisingly low. The simple 
reason: Anyone who is still successfully smuggling and 
illegally selling, uses an international network of companies 
which veils the origins of the goods almost perfectly. The 
Austrian customs service is, for instance, tracing a gang of 
Serbian merchants whose skillfully camouflaged empire reaches 
from Hong Kong via Cyprus to Barcelona and Moscow. "We cannot 
do anything," an investigator complains, "if they open a credit 
line for oil deals in Nicosia at an Austrian bank and in Nicosia 
the Beogradska Banka is involved." 
  Petrovic's Sad Job 
  Dusan Petrovic is in Vienna at precisely this bank. The head 
of the information office of Beogradska Banka laments about his 
sad job: "In 1990 our bank alone opened credit lines of 30 
billion shillings at Creditanstalt in Vienna. Today there is 
not a single schilling moving anymore." 
  In February 1993 the 62-year-old banker thought he had found 
a way out when he founded his own trading company, Beofinex 
Trading Company, to stay in the game via third-country business 
and on his own account. However, only a few months later, this 
kind of business was banned by the decree of the Vienna National 
Bank. As representative of Beogradska Banka, Dusan Petrovic 
regularly consults with Adria Bank in Vienna, where his employer 
from Belgrade still holds 21 percent of the shares. (footnote 
1) (The main Austrian shareholders of Adria Bank are Bank 
Austria--24 percent--and Creditanstalt 12 percent. A total of 
24 percent is held by the Slovene Lubljanska Banka and 21 
percent by the Croatian Zagrebacka Banka.) 
  After the outbreak of the military conflict, Adria Bank had 
to put considerable sums into reserves. Promptly, inspectors of 
the National Bank turned up, who investigated the institute for 
weeks, "but did not find any reason for complaints," as Director 
Alfred Scherhammer notes with satisfaction. At the meetings of 
the board of governors in Vienna time seems to stand still: 
Slovenes and Croats are still peacefully facing Serbian 
shareholders, who come from Belgrade. 
  Forced to do nothing, since the imposition of the embargo 
Petrovic has been dealing with comparably smaller sums and with 
individual cases such as the pensioners in Serbia and Montenegro 
who get a pension in Austria as former guest workers and have 
involuntarily gotten between the frontlines of the trade war. 
Petrovic: "This applies to a total of more than 30,000 
inviduals. Because transfers to Yugoslavia are banned, they 
must come to Austria. Among them there are people who get 1,000 
schillings per month. The trip alone costs that much." Borislav 
Kosanov, the highest-ranking diplomat of Milosevic's regime in 
Austria, says: "This is extremely inhuman." 
  While Kosanovic sees good prospects for an end of the UN 
blockade in June, Combick chief Ristic is already packing. 
Ristic has found an interesting tenant to succeed him on half 
of his 400 square meters of office area. It is the Viennese 
Oweka Trading Company of Montenegrin Petar Ivanovic. While all 
his compatriots in Austria are groaning because of the embargo, 
Ivanovic is obviously going through a period of expansive 
growth. The only plausible reason for this is a friendship 
between two men, in which he has invested much time for months 
and which opens many doors for him in Moscow. 
  After all, his new bosom buddy is Vladimir "Adolfovich" 
Zhirinovskiy. Some weeks ago host Ivanovic invited the Russian 
ultranationalist and a group of dubious advisers on a business 
trip to Belgrade and also accompanied him there.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Colette </F>
Braeckman; place and date not given: "On the Situation in 
Rwanda, Burundi, and Zaire"] 
  [Text] [Braeckman] You have just come back from Rwanda, and 
Defense Minister Leo Delcroix is flying out there today. What 
are your feelings after having seen the situation in the field? 
  [Claes] I cannot hide my concern at the present political 
vacuum, an economy in free fall, and the fact that the 
conditions which would permit the implementation of the Arusha 
accords have still not been met. But we cannot wait any longer: 
All the parties which feel able to participate in implementing 
these accords should do so, even if they leave others to join 
them later. Otherwise, I fear that Rwanda may move toward an 
almost structural confrontation between the ethnic groups. 
  [Braeckman] You have issued warnings and threatened to 
suspend cooperation. Have you been heard? 
  [Claes] My comments have not been followed by results, that 
is the least you can say: While I was in the country a 
political leader was assassinated, and I know that a lot of arms 
are held by the civilian population. I see no other solution 
than the implementation of the Arusha accords, even if a great 
deal will remain to be done after that. The two armies must be 
merged, a large part of those bearing arms must be demobilized, 
and an emergency plan must be drawn up for the economy. This 
too will require funding. 
  [Braeckman] How do you view the recent events in Burundi, 
and 
more massacres in Bujumbura? 
  [Claes] It is clear that the Army does not accept the power- 
sharing formula which emerged after the election of President 
Ndadaye and which was reproduced when his successor was 
appointed. 
  [Braeckman] Following the putsch there were calls for 
Belgian 
military intervention in order to avert further clashes, were 
there not? 
  [Claes] That is true. We were asked to send 2,000 soldiers, 
but it was clear the Army did not agree. There was a risk of 
violent confrontation. It was subsequently decided to send in a 
stabilization force consisting of troops designated by the 
Organization of African Unity. Belgium was ready to make a 
financial contribution of US$2 million to this force. 
  But even this, the dispatch of 180 men, was not acceptable 
to 
the Army. There was then talk of sending in 65 officers 
responsible for health and hygiene tasks, which was by no means 
a stabilization force. But the Burundian Army considered that 
even this was humiliating. During my talks with the government 
it became clear that the authorities want to reorganize the 
Army, they want to separate off the purely military activities 
of the gendarmerie and create a sort of republican guard. 
Belgium's help was requested, but if we now decide to restore 
military cooperation with Burundi, I wonder what kind of welcome 
our experts will receive and how we can take their suggestions 
into account. 
  [Braeckman] Belgium is still interested in Central Africa. 
But is it not one of the last remaining countries which is? 
  [Claes] This very morning I explained to the UN 
secretary-general's representative for Africa that there was a 
danger of countries in the industrialized world becoming 
disheartened over Africa, of turning their backs on it, if the 
Africans themselves did not give minimum guarantees of stability 
in order to allow a fruitful return to cooperation. You know 
that within the European Union, Belgium and France are the only 
two remaining champions of the African continent. It is only 
the Maghreb on the one hand and South Africa on the other which 
are still considered to be of interest. I must also point out 
that 85 percent of the Belgian cooperation budget is still 
destined for Africa. This cooperation must not become 
impossible. 
  [Braeckman] Turning now to Zaire, does the Western troika 
still exist? 
  [Claes] Together with Paris and Washington, we will accept 
the result of the current parliamentary sessions. We obviously 
recognize the new structure (HCR-PT, High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament), as it is the result of 
accords negotiated by the Zairians themselves. Negotiated, but 
not yet signed. Together with our partners, we support any prime 
minister drawn from this new Zairian Parliament: For us, it is 
not a question of individuals, but of principle. The HCR-PT is 
for us the new source of legality in Zaire. But I repeat that 
solid guarantees will be required before any further 
international aid is available.

<F P=106> [Article by LNS/CB: "Bonn and Paris See Dehaene as Delors </F>
Successor"] 
  [Text] Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene is the most 
likely candidate to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the 
European Commission on 1 January 1995, according to a report in 
yesterday's edition of the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN. He 
would apparently receive the backing of President Mitterrand of 
France and Chancellor Kohl of Germany, who prefer him to his 
Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers. The Parliament in Brussels 
takes this report very seriously. 
  A decision regarding a successor to Delors is expected to be 
made at the European summit of heads of state and government at 
the end of June in Corfu (Greece). 
  However, all that is certain for the moment is that the 
French Socialist Jacques Delors is to leave the Commission, the 
European Union's (EU) executive arm, after 10 years as its 
president. It is generally assumed that it is now the turn of a 
Christian Democrat from one of the EU's smaller member states. 
Until now, Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers was the most 
widely circulated name. 
  According to John Palmer of THE GUARDIAN, who is well known 
in European circles, Kohl and Mitterrand are exerting pressure 
on Dehaene to succeed Delors. Bonn and Paris apparently believe 
that Lubbers would lean too much toward the British. Kohl has 
also apparently not forgotten Lubbers' less than enthusiastic 
response to German reunification. Dehaene on the other hand 
greatly impressed the European Council last year during his term 
as president. 
  The pro-European profile of Dehaene is also to the liking of 
Europe's southern countries, who are counting on European 
solidarity. But it is precisely this profile which the British 
fear, officially supporting the candidacy of the present 
European commissioner, Leon Brittan. But even if the British 
give Lubbers their backing, Palmer reports that this would not 
stop Dehaene, provided of course that he decides to be a 
candidate. 
  When asked to comment, a spokesman for the prime minister 
would say no more than that Dehaene "has resolved not to respond 
to such rumors." 
  In the corridors of the Parliament building, Christian 
Democrat politicians responded with the comment that the report 
"has come too early, but is probably not incorrect." The fact 
that Dehaene reacted with a "no comment" rather than simply 
laughing it off is being seen as some kind of confirmation. 
  The news has caused a stir in the political world. The main 
question was how the prime minister would be able to organize 
such a move without triggering a government crisis. If he did 
decide to make the change, the local elections would seem to be 
the most appropriate time. The parliamentary elections are then 
14 months away at the most. 
  The move would also not be without its consequences for 
Karel 
Van Miert, who can no longer remain a European commissioner 
after 1 January 1995. It would also block the way for a Belgian 
presidency of the WEU [Western European Union], for which Mark 
Eyskens is a candidate. 
  Other observers point out that it would be a remarkable step 
up for someone who has only stood for election on a single 
occasion. Eric Van Rompuy of the CVP [Christian People's Party] 
reacted jokingly to the report. "That's good news, then Herman 
can become prime minister," he said, referring to his brother. 
  In any event, the situation will have to be made clear very 
soon. Especially in the Netherlands, where after the rout 
suffered by the CDA [Christian Democrat Party] in the local 
elections it is thought possible that Lubbers may announce 
before the parliamentary elections that he is to retire from 
national politics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bell Gets Big Contract -- Alcatel </F>
Bell Wins Orders for Half a Billion Belgian Francs"] 
  [Text] Alcatel Bell, the Belgian subsidiary of the 
Alcatel-Alsthom group, said on Wednesday [9 March] that it had 
won two contracts in the modernization of the public telephone 
exchange network in the region of Kaliningrad, a port on the 
Baltic. The total value of the projects is $15 million, or 
532.5 million Belgian francs. These contracts were signed by 
LenBell, a Russian company in which Alcatel Bell is the majority 
shareholder. They concern the delivery of 50,000 telephone 
lines of the Alcatel 1000 System 12 type to a mixed 
Franco-Russian company. 
  The order will be spread over four years and involves the 
delivery of a combined international-interurban-local exchange 
and several local exchanges, distant subscriber units, 
analog-numerical conversion equipment and material for 
transmission by fiber optics and electromagnetic waves. The 
first combined exchange will be put into service next September. 
  Last year Alcatel Bell and LenBell had already signed 
contracts for the delivery and installation of 84,000 phone 
lines in the cities of Novosibirsk, Kostroma, Dubno, Ufa, 
Moscow, Voronezh, and Pakov [as published]. Most of the 
exchanges will be delivered before the end of 1994. 
<H5>  And in Korea too </H5>
  On Wednesday Alcatel Bell also announced winning a 140 
million Belgian franc contract in South Korea. Signed with 
Dacom Corporation, the contract also concerns the delivery of an 
Alcatel 1000 System 12 program. "This contract is the result of 
an international public call for tenders," a company press 
release stressed. The company headquarters are in Antwerp.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Second Chamber Unanimously Approves </F>
To Keep the `Country' Aruba"] 
  [Excerpts] The Hague -- The Second Chamber voted virtually 
unanimously to keep Aruba within the Kingdom as a country. This 
happened yesterday during the discussion of a statute law aimed 
at amending the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
  The Aruba debate was one of the rare occasions in which the 
Chamber was filled with "special delegates" from the Antilles 
and Aruban states. The last time this happened was almost 10 
years ago, when a provision was included in the Charter 
stipulating that Aruba would assume a separate status as of 1 
January 1996, becoming independent as of the same date under 
international law. In the bill currently on the table, this 
provision has been scrapped. Minister Hirsch Ballin was 
assisted in the defense by the prime ministers of Aruba and the 
Antilles, the ministers plenipotentiary from both countries, and 
the Aruban justice minister. 
  Only the two single-person groups, the Reformist Political 
Federation and the Center Democrats, opposed the bill. The 
Parliaments of the Antilles and Aruba unanimously supported it. 
The Netherlands still includes the condition that talks with 
Aruba on improving the administration of the island and 
reorganizing government finances are held and implemented in 
good time. [passage omitted] 
  Aruban opposition leader Eman lashed out fiercely at the 
government of Prime Minister Oduber, who, he said, has brought 
the island to the brink of bankruptcy with an overly generous 
spending policy and by appointing political friends to official 
posts. Eman warned Minister Hirsch Ballin that financial 
support by the Netherlands for Oduber in Aruba will be construed 
as "a bonus for improper administration." The Aruban prime 
minister had already said before the debate that Eman practiced 
dishonest opposition and has no time for the radical 
re-organization which he initiated.

<F P=106> [Commentary by H.J.A. Hofland: "The Spreading of the </F>
Scandal"] 
  [Text] The scandal occupying U.S. politics under the 
collective name of Whitewater is approaching the point where it 
will become too big to be tamed. It is just like the legendary 
laboratory rat which has received too many growth hormones and 
is now showing signs of growing into a monster of Spielberg-like 
dimensions. As is the case with scandals, it is being 
cheerfully fed by the many people who have an interest in the 
destruction of the suspected victims. It is an omnivore of 
rumors, revelations, hatred, pleasure in the misfortune of 
others, panic, good intentions and the regular people's court of 
investigations. If it is not killed in time, then it will 
outgrow everyone, as happened with Watergate, which cost more 
people than Nixon their political life. Seen from a distance, 
the scandal is growing into a play where witches' cabals, 
purification and self-destruction can no longer be separated 
out. At this stage Whitewater already stands for an innumerable 
quantity of suspicions, errors, contradictory interests, shadowy 
affairs, embezzlements, a whole which in itself asks for 
clarifications. There is only one conclusion to be drawn: This 
could well last for a long time. 
  The U.S. scandal, in addition to being theatre along the 
lines of drama, is also an obstacle which has virtually halted 
foreign policy. When Joseph McCarthy declared that he had a 
list of 254 members of the communist party who had infiltrated 
the State Department, he kept Eisenhower's and Dulles' hands 
full with more than a year of work. Watergate meant a temporary 
end to the rest of the world for the Americans. Reagan proved 
to have more understanding of scandal management. While the 
evidence piled up about his involvement in, or at least 
knowledge of the Iran-Contra scandal, his enemies did not 
succeed in damaging his presidency. He could not be disturbed 
as he continued to fight the evil empire and then wind down the 
Cold War. That was genius. When Bush took over, the 
Republicans' front had closed up again, the confusion about the 
smoldering scandal worked against his opponents and the urgency 
had disappeared. 
  The Whitewater affair is totally different. At present 
everything would indicate that the zenith has yet to be reached. 
It is difficult to say how much hatred has been generated by 
Clinton over the last two years. He successfully pushed his 
affair with Jennifer Flowers into the background during the 
election campaign. He managed to overcome the disadvantages of 
his Vietnam past, he did not go there. Attempts to reveal 
others affairs have been derailed. His plan to reform the 
health care system is arousing fanatical opposition. The fact 
that the economy is recovering well under a Democratic 
presidency is not putting the Republicans in a good mood. 
Everything is contributing at present to making Whitewater the 
occasion for revenge. 
  We know that after the end of the Cold War, U.S. interest in 
West Europe weakened considerably. The first cause is the 
concentration on the big domestic issues, the second is the 
European incapacity to solve the conflict in Bosnia. Other 
priorities are emerging within the limited field of Washington's 
interests. Last year at approximately this time the bomb 
exploded under the World Trade Center. Those responsible have 
been imprisoned for life. The initial investigation and trial 
led to a suspicion that they are part of a wider conspiracy. 
The suspicion has become stronger with the attack last week on 
four orthodox Jewish students, one of whom has in the meantime 
died. In the background the fear is growing that the conflict 
between Israel and the Arabs is being extended to New York. 
  The unmasking of a CIA agent as a Russian spy has not 
boosted 
confidence in this famous secret service. Many murders occur in 
the United States, ever greater efforts to fight them are taking 
place, but political crimes and political terrorism 
traditionally arouse extra opposition, as shown by the fate of 
the Rosenbergs and Sacco and Vanzetti. Because then the efforts 
have to be mobilized against foreigners with dangerous political 
intentions. 
  The latest indication that Washington wants the least 
possible involvement with problems in Europe, be it West, 
Central or East, can be found in the visit by Shevardnadze, once 
a faithful interlocutor of Reagan and now president of a 
distant, small country in a civil war. It is rare that a 
visiting president has been pushed into the well of oblivion so 
quickly, although he did receive a promise of $70 million in all 
sorts of aid, but without any perspective of U.S. participation 
in a UN peace force. 
  The Whitewater scandal is developing in these circumstances. 
Even if things turn out well for the Clintons, in any case they 
will certainly have their hands full for a good time. This 
means that West Europe will be able to count on a U.S. presence 
even less than during the last two to three years. Fourteen 
days ago U.S. fighters under the supervision of NATO shot down 
four Serbian planes. The Europeans will have to content 
themselves with that example. As long as Whitewater lasts, 
Europe will have to clean things up itself. 
  Politics are surprising. The only person who will presently 
be benefiting from an investment project in Arkansas 16 years 
ago, and the obscurity which followed it, is the ethnic chief 
Karadzic, who is investing in death and destruction.

<F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The IRA can still join the peace talks if it 
renounces violence, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd stressed 
today. He made his pledge as the Government faced calls to 
withdraw the offer to the terrorists following two attacks on 
Heathrow Airport. 
  Mr Hurd insisted that the Downing Street declaration still 
stood, but accused the IRA of "devious dishonesty" in claiming 
that it wanted clarification of the document. 
  The latest mortar attack, just after midnight this morning, 
came after Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams warned of more 
"spectacular" strikes to remind the world of the Republican 
cause. 
  Mr Hurd said: "The Downing Street declaration isn't a 
bargaining document. It is a statement of the two governments, 
the British and Irish governments, that the future of Northern 
Ireland is going to be settled by consent, by the wishes of the 
people who live there, and that everyone can take part in that 
process -- except those who are practising violence. That is 
clear enough and that stands." 
  Mr Hurd attacked the IRA, saying: "These are people who 
claim 
to be asking for clarifications of this document about democracy 
and in fact they are scaring and killing people. I hope the 
devious dishonesty of that is clear to everyone everywhere who 
might have been taken in in the past." 
  Northern Ireland's problems could not be solved by violence 
and the people of Ireland no longer had any sympathy for 
settling them through aggression, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today 
programme. 
  Earlier politicians from all sides condemned the overnight 
mortar bomb attack on Heathrow Airport -- the second in as many 
days -- and urged a cooler approach to the IRA. 
  Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour Party MP for 
Newry and Armagh, warned that the IRA was sending a clear 
message that it was prepared to continue its campaign of 
violence. 
  It was clear that the IRA was "intent on pursuing their 
objectives through this type of very vicious cynical attacks on 
not just personnel at Heathrow but on personnel in Northern 
Ireland," he told the programme. "I believe there is a section 
within the IRA who simply are not going to stop." 
  Wolverhampton South West Tory MP Nick Budgen said the 
Government should not invite the IRA to join the peace talks, 
adding: "The IRA ought to be treated as criminals and not as 
people who have a legitimate right to negotiate about the 
constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland." 
  Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Ulster, also 
denounced Gerry Adams's "callous" warning of more spectaculars, 
saying: "Wherever the road to peace leads it doesn't lead 
through the IRA." 
  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew last night 
condemned Mr Adams. His comment came after the Sinn Fein leader 
warned of more attacks by saying: "The conflict is ongoing. 
Every so often there will be something spectacular to remind 
the outside world." 
  Sir Patrick said in London last night: "I deeply resent and 
reject the tone and content of what he is reported to have said." 
  He told a meeting of the European Atlantic Group: "The 
gloating character of that observation seems to me to be quite 
despicable and a remark of profound cynicism."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Step Up the Pressure"] </F>
  [Text] Wednesday night's [9 March] IRA mortar attack on 
Heathrow should cause little surprise. It had already become 
apparent that no consensus to support the peace process existed 
within Sinn Fein. It matters little whether the Heathrow 
operation was centrally directed by the IRA Army Council or 
launched by one of the independent cells in which the terrorists 
now operate, for security reasons. The consequence was to send 
a message to the world that, for the Provisionals, it is 
business as usual, and a minute or two either way with this 
particular business could have cost a planeload of passengers 
their lives. 
  We have urged the British and Irish governments not to allow 
Sinn Fein to make political capital out of its prevarications 
towards the Downing Street Declaration. Now, the two 
governments have no excuse for waiting any longer, and should 
act speedily to regain the initiative. They should increase 
military activity against the IRA by intensifying co-operation 
between their security forces -- if Dublin possesses the 
political will to do its part. Equally important, they should 
step up the political pressure on Sinn Fein. 
  The government in Dublin and John Hume's SDLP [Social 
Democratic Labour Party] have expended much effort on wooing 
Republican opinion, but they have failed to show matching 
sensitivity towards Unionist concerns, or towards fostering 
local political progress within Ulster. The Declaration will 
plainly remain on the table as the basis on which Sinn Fein can 
enter the political scene if it ever becomes willing to renounce 
violence. But, if Dublin and the SDLP intend to pursue the 
objectives of the Declaration with anything more useful than 
rhetoric, they should make common cause against Sinn Fein with 
the British Government and the Unionists.

<F P=106> [Report by Nell Darbyshire, Sean O'Neill, and Dan Conaghan: </F>
"Crude Weapons on Front Line of Propaganda War"] 
  [Text] Although the Heathrow attack will bring comparisons 
with the 1991 Downing Street mortar bombing, it appears to have 
been less sophisticated, designed more to disrupt than injure. 
  The home-made rockets were crude and, unlike the Downing 
Street incident which had to circumvent tight security, 
yesterday's attack was indiscriminate. 
  However, the target was sufficiently important to cause 
immense disruption, achieve maximum publicity and carry little 
risk of arrest -- all factors behind mainland IRA attacks. 
  Since the Downing Street declaration, Scotland Yard has 
feared an IRA "spectacular" to give notice that there are still 
active terrorist cells capable of continuing the mainland 
campaign. 
  Recent Royal Ulster Constabulary intelligence reports are 
understood to have mentioned rumours from within the Northern 
Irish Republican community of another mortar attack, and the 
Yard has been on alert. 
  At least two IRA cells are believed to be in London and they 
may be less enthusiastic about the prospect of peace than Sinn 
Fein. 
  While Mr Gerry Adams and other Sinn Fein leaders vacillate 
about the clarity of the Downing Street declaration terms, there 
are other IRA factions who wish to send a message to all parties 
that they are not prepared to lay down their arms. 
  Peace could bring a rapid end to the enormous profits being 
made from IRA racketeering activities and would remove the 
status attached to the terrorist "volunteer." The alternative 
for many would be unemployment or a life of crime without the 
semblance of political justification. 
  Mortar bombs of the type used in the Heathrow attack are one 
of the IRA's favoured weapons since their development in the 
early 1970s. 
  Typically they contain between 40 pounds and 60 pounds of 
home- made explosives, packed into a gas cylinder and with a 
range of 200- 300 yards. 
  Clusters of two or four mortars are fired from tubes 
attached 
to a frame and placed inside a car or van. They can be fired 
through a hole cut in the roof of the vehicle, or through a 
conventional sunroof. 
  The first such device was used against an Army base in 
Londonderry in 1972 and became known as the Mark One. It 
comprised an 8-inch piece of steel pipe packed with home-made 
explosive. 
  Successors to the Mark One were developed throughout the 
1970s and 1980s. Modifications included a firing pin and gas 
bottle of the type used to pump draught beer in pubs. 
  Fins to stabilise the bombs in flight were added and a 
propeller was fixed to the canister's nose. The device would 
tighten in flight and detonate the explosive on impact, causing 
the canister to shatter showering the target with shrapnel. 
  By February 1985, the most devastating IRA mortar attack 
killed nine police officers -- two of them women -- at Newry RUC 
[Royal Ulster Constabulary] station. The terrorists fired nine 
home-made mortars, each containing about 50 pounds of explosive, 
from tubes fastened to a steel frame and welded to the back of a 
lorry. 
  The crudely-made weapons, known as Mark 10s, were wildly 
inaccurate -- in Newry only one bomb struck its target. Several 
others overshot their target or failed to explode. 
  The lorry bearing the weapon had been parked in a disused 
works yard and aimed by pointing the weapon towards the 
station's radio mast. 
  In other IRA mortar attacks, including that on Downing 
Street, the shells have been launched from the rear of transit 
vans. 
  The only person the IRA has murdered in Northern Ireland 
this 
year was a police officer killed when a mortar struck the side 
of his armoured Land Rover in Belfast last month. 
  Constable Jonathan Beacom was killed in the Markets area 
close to Belfast city centre by a horizontally-fired mortar. 
  Partly as a result of the need to protect against mortar 
attack, the city's main Aldergrove airport is surrounded by a 
three-mile security cordon through which all traffic must pass. 
  The IRA currently favours two types of mortar -- the Mark 16 
which fires a 200 pound charge packed into a gas cylinder up to 
300 yards and the Mark 10, a horizontally-fired mortar with a 50 
pound charge and a range of around 80 yards.

<F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley: "Alert Comes as Committee on </F>
Ulster Is Voted In"] 
  [Text] Last night's attack coincided with the start of 24 
hours of significant political activity on the future governance 
of the Province. 
  Not only did it take place during a debate on the renewal of 
the Prevention of Terrorism Act but it came just hours before 
MPs voted to set up a select committee on Northern Ireland for 
the first time in Parliamentary history -- a move bitterly 
opposed by Nationalists. 
  It also came on the eve of today's Anglo-lrish Conference 
talks in London between Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland 
Secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier. 
  The two men will consider the best way to move forward from 
the Downing Street Declaration after its effective rejection by 
Sinn Fein. 
  MP's were speculating that the attack -- the most serious on 
the British mainland since the Downing Street Declaration -- 
will increase the pressure on Mr Major to end all efforts to 
bring Sinn Fein to the negotiating table. 
  One said: "This just boosts the need to turn the screw on 
the terrorists." 
  However, senior sources said last night that they would not 
allow the attack to "deflect" them from their search for peace. 
  Last night's vote to establish the select committee, which 
was passed by 324 to 221 votes, met a key Unionist demand and is 
seen by them as an important step towards closer ties between 
Britain and Ulster. While all other departments have a select 
committee to monitor their work, ministers had resisted 
establishing one for Northern Ireland, arguing that without 
Nationalist support it could damage the peace process.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>
  [Text] British reinforcement troops were today moving into 
position in Bosnia just hours after arriving in the region as 
part of a 7,200-strong international force to support fragile 
United Nations ceasefires. 
  The advance party of the 900-strong battalion group based on 
the Duke of Wellington's Regiment left the Croatian port of 
Split at first light to move up-country into central Bosnia. 
They were replacing hard-pressed troops from the Coldstream 
Guards, who have been working 18-hour days striving to enforce 
the truce agreements with thinly-spread resources. 
  They are being stationed at British bases at Duvno, Gornji 
Vakuf, Vitez and Zepce and will be used to man checkpoints, 
observation posts, weapon collection points and to help with aid 
operations. 
  Once their Saxon armoured vehicles arrive, they will be able 
to patrol the 125-mile buffer zone between Croat and Muslim 
forces across central Bosnia. 
  "They have been deployed immediately on the ground to all 
four locations and as more come in they will be moved up-country 
straight away," said a British military spokesman. 
  "The speed of the operation is quite astonishing but we want 
to move them into position as quickly as possible." 
  Troops from the 900-strong force will continue to arrive 
over 
the next week and ships carrying the armoured vehicles will dock 
between March 21 and 23. 
  The Royal Fleet Auxiliary landing ships Sir Tristram left 
the 
Marchwood military port at Southampton today. Her sister ships 
Sir Galahad and Sir Bedivere will leave tomorrow and Sunday [13 
March] respectively. 
  Precise details of the deployment will be worked out at a 
meeting tomorrow of the Joint Commission set up with Croat and 
Muslim leaders and chaired by British Brigadier John Reith. 
  Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Williams, commander of the 
Coldstream Guards, and Lt-Col David Santa-Olalla, CO of the Duke 
of Wellington's Regiment, will both attend the meeting to work 
out areas of operations. 
  "All of this will accelerate the return to normality in the 
region with a consequent reduction in these tasks," said a 
miliary source. 
  The Government hopes the "creeping ceasefire" which is 
spreading across Bosnia will persuade other nations, notably the 
United States to take part in the UN operation. 
  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it was the right time to 
send extra troops to reinforce the ceasefires. 
  "There is a good military principle about reinforcing 
success. In the last couple of weeks it has become clear, not 
that all danger is over, but that the war in Bosnia is beginning 
to die," he said. 
  "Now it may come back again to being horrible and savage but 
there is an opportunity now, not as part of a general settlement 
so far, but place by place, Sarajevo first and now in central 
Bosnia where our troops are." 
  Troops were needed to implement the ceasefires and create 
confidence so fighting did not break out again along the truce 
lines. The British force will be fundamentally reorganised 
following the Government's decision yesterday to reinforce. 
  British Battalion One, which will have its headquarters at 
Vitez, will be based on the Coldstream Guards with 
responsibility for the area from Maglaj in the north to Vitez 
and west to Travnik. It will consist of companies with Warrior 
armoured fighting vehicles, two squadrons of Light Dragoons with 
Scimitar light tanks and one company with Saxons. 
  British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's 
Regiment, will have its headquarters in Bugojno with two 
Saxon-equipped companies. A Warrior company will be based at 
Gornji Vakuf. It will be responsible for the area south of Vitez 
including Gornji Vakuf, which has been a key flashpoint, Prozor 
and Duvno.

  [Excerpts] Responsibility for last night's mortar attack on 
Heathrow Airport in London has been claimed by the IRA. In a 
statement issued in Dublin, the organization claimed it had 
given specific warnings about the bombing more than an hour 
beforehand. [passage omitted] The president of Sinn Fein, Gerry 
Adams, said the bombing was a reminder that the cause of the 
conflict in the north had not been removed. He was speaking on 
RTE radio this morning. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The IRA will not bomb the peace process off track, 
Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said today. 
  Security co-operation would continue at the highest possible 
level and political talks should go on, Mr Spring said after the 
second terrorist attack on London's Heathrow Airport within as 
many days. 
  "We are not going to be put off course by the IRA or by 
these 
despicable acts in which they have engaged in the last 48 
hours," he told RTE radio in Dublin. 
  "I think what is important is that both governments have 
made 
it very clear that we are determined to work on and obviously 
there is responsibility on all politicians now to see if we can 
resume the dialogue on Northern Ireland." 
  There was no "political vacuum," he insisted. 
  Asked whether the latest mortar bomb attack had bankrupted 
the IRA and Sinn Fein in his eyes, Mr Spring said: "What has 
happened in the last 48 hours has been quite outrageous in 
relation to the efforts of both governments to establish peace 
on this island. We must condemn them out of hand." 
  He had been studying Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's 
remarks about IRA "spectaculars," he said, adding: "I have to 
say I think those remarks are absolutely outrageous in terms of 
what the governments are trying to do. We have been trying to 
build on the Downing Street declaration."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Moscow and Bonn are to make 
further joint efforts to solve the problems of Russian ethnic 
Germans. This was stressed by Horst Waffenschmidt, the German 
Government's representative for resettlers and parliamentary 
state secretary in the Interior Ministry, in Bonn on Friday [11 
March] at the conclusion of the fifth session of the 
German-Russian Government commission on Russian ethnic Germans. 
  He welcomed the fact that, in spite of the difficult 
situation it found itself in, the Russian Government had 
promised considerable funds. The German Interior Ministry would 
make available a total of 65 million marks this year for the 
settlement centers for Russian Germans. The money is to go to 
housebuilding, cultural institutions, and medium-sized 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Vlastimil </F>
Kovar and Petr Nemec; place and date not given: "The 
Attractiveness of the European Union Is Unshakeable"] 
  [Text] [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] The so-called Euroskepticism 
is spreading in Europe. The faith in a united Europe is less 
intensive now than it was at the time of the signing of the 
Maastricht Treaty. Do you think that the original ideas about 
the European Union [EU] will undergo modification? 
  [Kinkel] One Briton said recently about Europe: "It is 
boring to be part of it, but it would be a tragedy not to be 
part of it." That describes the situation quite aptly. A 
minister of foreign affairs does not like to come across 
Euroskepticism often. Indeed, there are growing doubts about 
Europe, which used to develop on its own. Brussels is being 
blamed for everything that is negative. Europe does, of course, 
have its weaknesses. I agree with the criticism of excessive 
regulation. Unfortunately, however, I frequently hear criticism 
that turns out to be unsubstantiated when taking a closer look. 
  The main question is: What sort of Europe do we want? What 
should the EU look like in the future? An even more important 
question is: What is Europe doing to secure jobs and internal 
and external security? Those are legitimate questions to which 
we, politicians, must reply. To respond to your specific 
question -- a rectification of the excessive regulation and 
exaggerated centralism is inevitable. The goals of the EU will 
remain unchanged, however. The attractiveness of the union is 
unshakeable. Just look at the list of states that have 
expressed their wish to join. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Europe has not been able to resolve the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia. All political and security 
mechanisms, such as the CSCE, have failed. Do such institutions 
still have any raison d'etre in the first place? What could 
replace them? 
  [Kinkel] Although we justifiably feel bitterness, we should 
not succumb to radical pessimism. It is a sad fact that in 
former Yugoslavia there is a danger that, for the first time 
since World War II, the European map might be redrawn by means 
of weapons. Europe could pay for a long time to come for its 
failure to prevent that. The decisions by the EU, NATO, and the 
UN Security Council of the last few days clearly show the 
firmness with which the international community reacts to the 
Bosnian war. We have sent a signal to all parties to the 
conflict that the civilized world will no longer stand idly by 
and watch killing and political maneuvering. NATO has expressed 
unambiguously, and with firm deadlines, its determination for 
military action, if necessary, which has evidently had its 
impact. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] What are your ideas of a fully 
functioning system of European security that could guarantee 
also the security of the states of Central and East Europe? 
  [Kinkel] Our aim is a just and lasting order in Europe that 
would bring peace, stability, and security to all Europeans. To 
achieve this aim, it is important that different institutions 
with their specific contributions to the security architecture 
-- that is, the CSCE, the EU, the Western European Union [WEU], 
and, of course, also NATO -- join together in a way that will 
not create new trenches in Europe. We support the efforts of 
the Czech Republic and other countries of Central and East 
Europe to draw closer on a wide front toward the structures of 
European and trans-Atlantic security. By advancing to these 
countries the Partnership for Peace offer, the NATO summit in 
January 1994 submitted specific proposals to this effect, some 
of which have been partly implemented. Partnership for Peace 
will play an important role in the evolutionary process of 
NATO's expansion. We are also trying to improve the status of 
these countries with regard to the WEU. Trans-Atlantic 
partnership and European unification are for us pillars of 
Europe's future security architecture. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] There is talk at present of stagnation 
in Czech-German relations. Do you agree with this assessment? 
If you do, where do you see the causes? Another question: The 
Czech Government is taking steps to partially indemnify [Czech] 
victims of Nazism. What do you think about this? When will 
Germany itself be able to compensate for this guilt, in your 
opinion? 
  [Kinkel] I would not speak of stagnation in Czech-German 
relations. However, their development does not meet our mutual 
expectations in every respect. 
  In the economic sphere, with a roughly 25 percent share in 
both imports and exports, we are clearly the most important 
partner of the Czech Republic. We have opened our market to 
Czech products. Thousands of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, 
especially in the border regions. Millions of German tourists 
visit the Czech Republic. By all this we are considerably 
contributing to economic and social stability in the Czech 
Republic. 
  In other areas, such as cooperation in the border regions or 
political cooperation among young people, I see possibilities to 
achieve success, following problems that were associated partly 
with Czechoslovakia's partition. 
  Of course, claims of Czech victims of Nazism for 
compensation 
exist. Along with these claims, there also exist the claims of 
Sudeten Germans expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II. 
  Germany is aware of its responsibility toward the Czech 
victims of Nazism. We will seek an adequate solution. 
  We are watching with interest the Czech Government's steps 
concerning partial indemnification of Czech victims of Nazism. 
There must not be any prejudice, however. A dialogue must be 
conducted with the Sudeten Germans. Results of the German-Czech 
commission of historians, which has just published a report on 
its second symposium on "Germans, Czechs, and Slovaks during the 
[1918-1938] First Republic," should be taken into consideration 
much more than heretofore. This could help make the discussion 
more businesslike, which is badly needed. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] Do you think that the upcoming election 
campaign in Germany is making the talks on outstanding issues 
with the Czech Republic more complicated? 
  [Kinkel] No. The topic itself is not complicated. Quick 
solutions cannot be expected, however. 
  [HOSPODARSKE NOVINY] How do you assess conditions for 
Western businessmen in the Czech Republic? What shortcomings 
exist in this area, in your opinion? 
  [Kinkel] An assessment of the general conditions for 
entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic has been carried out by the 
German economy itself. On the one hand, it transpires from the 
bilateral trade statistics that Germany is the by far most 
important trading partner of the Czech Republic. Besides, the 
Czech economy has absorbed a considerable portion of German 
investments oriented towards Central and East European 
countries. The Germans are in second place among foreign 
investors, close behind the Americans. All this serves as proof 
that the German economy assesses the conditions for economic 
involvement in the Czech Republic as advantageous. The only 
point about which German entrepreneurs occasionally complain are 
certain administrative problems they encounter when implementing 
their projects. These problems are rather marginal, however, 
considering the great dynamism with which the Czech economy has 
been realizing its transition toward market economy.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] To 
increase revenues, you need partners on the global aviation 
market. The most important cooperation project -- that with 
United Airlines -- is, however, still uncertain. 
  [Weber] Since the signing of the partnership agreement, 
United and Lufthansa have cooperated well in many fields, but 
the joint flights cannot be organized because the Americans are 
blocking the aviation agreement. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] When will Washington finally give the 
go-ahead? 
  [Weber] I would love to know that. Unfortunately, over the 
past few days, the Americans have placed new obstacles in our 
path. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of obstacles? 
  [Weber] Basically, the only issue that is stil contentious 
is the so-called third country code sharing. The Americans -- 
above all, American and Delta Airlines -- want to make joint 
flights beyond Germany with East European airlines, such as 
Poland's LOT, Hungary's Malev, or Aeroflot, and in unlimited 
numbers. 
  [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which you cannot accept? 
  [Weber] No, this would set us back again on the path toward 
equal treatment. The fact that American and Delta may conduct 
such code sharing is fine with me, but not in greater numbers 
than we and United are permitted. Anything else is blackmail.

  [Text] Hanover (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has noted "considerable common ground with the SPD 
[Social Democratic Party]" on foreign policy, for example on 
European policy. Speaking to the Hannover NEUE PRESSE (Friday 
[11 March] edition), Kinkel referred however to the dispute over 
international deployments by the Bundeswehr. This is an 
absolutely central issue, over which Germany risks being damaged 
by the SPD's blockade. The SPD must "force itself to make a 
turnaround" on this, Kinkel demanded. Even a clarification by 
the Federal Constitutional Court does not "release the SPD from 
its share of the responsibility to find the necessary political 
solution on the necessary amendment to the Basic Law on 
Bundeswehr deployment." The Federal Republic has every reason 
to strengthen the United Nations in terms of organization, 
personnel, and finance, Kinkel said. Germany has no cause to 
"humble itself." It must represent its interests, but it also 
has to realize that these interests are linked to those of other 
states. "We adhere to our culture of restraint," the minister 
added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Asylum Law Stems Tide of </F>
Applicants"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The asylum law that came into force on 1 
July last year has caused a clear fall in the number of 
asylum-seekers. According to an Interior Ministry report, there 
were 98,500 applicants for asylum in the second half of 1993, 
against 224,099 in the first half of that year. However, the 
report says it is too soon to provide a definite assessment of 
the new law. 
  According to the report, there was a marked fall in the 
number of asylum-seekers from Romania and Bulgaria; between July 
and December 1993 the numbers were 9,898 and 2,438 respectively. 
In the first half of 1993, 63,827 Romanians and 20,109 
Bulgarians sought asylum. The fact that an application for 
asylum no longer provides automatic entitlement to a longer stay 
is given as an explanation for the reduced number of 
applications. 
  The total number of known cases of illegal entry has also 
fallen by 45 percent, but the demand for the services of helpers 
has clearly risen. Some 438 cases of illegal entry were 
recorded in the first quarter of 1993, and 509 in the second 
quarter. 
  At the end of 1993, the Federal Office for the Recognition 
of 
Foreign Refugees was dealing with 296,300 applications, 163,965 
less than in the middle of the year. The number of expulsions 
also rose from 10,798 in 1992 to 35,915 in 1993.

<F P=106> [Daniel Riegger report: "`Every Bit of Independence Is Wiped </F>
Out'"] 
  [Text] The fact that the Serb authorities have now put 
deaf-mutes in the Kosovo Academy of Arts and Sciences that they 
had forced to close down is not regarded as a coincidence by 
Adem Demaci. Belgrade is systematically "Serbianizing" the 
Albanian province of Kosovo. Writer Adem Demaci considers the 
fact that deaf-mutes are now living in the building where the 
freedom of the Albanian word used to be fought for as "cynicism, 
a way of humiliating the Albanians." 
  For his conviction, Demaci spent 28 years in prisons and 
work 
camps. He is a symbol of the Kosovo Albanians' resistance to 
Serb oppression, and he is a winner of the Sakharov Prize for 
Human Rights awarded by the European Parliament. Demaci, who 
came to Frankfurt at the invitation of the International Society 
for Human Rights, talked to FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU about the 
situation of the oppressed province of Kosovo, whose population 
includes 2 million Albanians and 200,000 Serbs. 
  "Anything that looks a bit like independence, individual 
spirit, and initiative, is wiped out." As the latest link in a 
long chain, the Institute for Albanology in the province's 
capital Pristina was closed this week and the scientists beaten 
up. The oppression is getting increasingly comprehensive, 
arrests and interrogations with torture are the order of the day. 
  Demaci complains that Europe does not care enough for the 
situation of the Kosovo Albanians. "The Serbs can tell the 
Albanians, look, we can do with you whatever we want, the world 
does not react, does not protect you." 
  For Demaci, the fact that the German Government and the 
laender want to send Kosovo Albanians back to their country in 
the planned mass deportations is "as if you throw somebody out 
of a train speeding through the country at 100 kilometers per 
hour." All those deported are likely to be interrogated by 
Serbian police in Kosovo, who quite often beat and torture them 
to get supposed confessions out of them. The human rights 
activist: "If they flee Kosovo because they were politically 
persecuted, prison is waiting for them; if they flee recruitment 
into the army, the court-martial awaits them; and if they flee 
because they had nothing to eat, death from starvation awaits 
them." Kosovo very much suffers from the embargo on the FRY; 
there is no fuel, no food, and medical supplies are very poor. 
  If the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina ends with Serbia being 
allowed to keep its occupied territories, oppression in Kosovo 
will become even more brutal, "then Serbia can play the master 
of the entire Balkans," Demaci fears.

<F P=106> [Article by "lip": "Better Prospects for German Exports in </F>
1994"] 
  [Text] Hamburg -- According to the Hamburg-based HWWA 
[Hamburg World Economic Archive] Institute for Economic 
Research, the German balance of trade surplus will continue to 
grow. The current account balance will, however, "register an 
estimated deficit of 35 billion German marks [DM]." 
  In the view of the Hamburg economic research staff, 
prospects 
for a sustained growth in German exports have increased over the 
past few months. The United States is experiencing a brisk 
upswing. In addition, a relaxation of monetary policy and the 
attendant reduction in interest rates have created favorable 
conditions for higher demand and output. 
  The HWWA states that German exports will profit from the 
improved economic climate in the industrialized countries, 
especially in Europe. The negative effects on demand of the 
German mark's high value in relation to other currencies will 
continue to diminish. As the upturn in the economic climate in 
Europe will continue at its present rate in the immediate 
future, the HWWA expects exports to grow moderately. 
  The institute estimates that west German exports will grow 
by 
about 5 percent in real terms in 1994. Last year, exports fell 
by about 6 percent. East German exporters are still heavily 
oriented toward former Soviet markets. Demand there is only 
expected to pick up slightly in the near future. In addition, 
east German exporters now have to compete against their west 
German counterparts. However, the east German economy is only 
gradually becoming more competitive internationally. The 
improvement in the worldwide economic climate is making it 
easier to enter new markets in the West. The HWWA's overall 
assessment is that "east German exports will continue to 
increase this year." 
  Economic expansion in western Germany will cause imports to 
start rising again, writes the HWWA. The institute estimates 
that west German imports will grow by about 4 percent in real 
terms in 1994. In 1993, imports in the old laender fell by about 
9 percent. In the view of the HWWA, imports from Central and 
East European countries "will register above average growth." 
  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have already ceased 
to be solely suppliers of raw materials and simple preproducts. 
They will gradually assume "the role of threshold countries." 
According to the HWWA, the increase in east German imports, 
which already rose last year, will "be in double figures 
assuming there is continued economic recovery."

<F P=106> [Wolfgang Georgi commentary: "Commodity Human Rights"] </F>
  [Text] President Clinton is once again caught in a 
difficult dilemma: His human rights representative, John 
Shattuck, had just reported "constructive discussions" with the 
government in Beijing, and the next moment the old men in China 
hit out at their dissidents. It was "significant progress" in 
the field of human rights that Clinton had expressly made the 
precondition for extending the most-favored-nation clause in 
trade with China. 
  But this demonstration of U.S. determination does not seem 
to 
have impressed Beijing very much. China knows very well that a 
market of 1.2 billion potential buyers magically attracts 
industrial nations suffering from recession. And so far, the 
West has always given in as soon as Beijing made some vague 
indications of willingness to improve. 
  What has become a major slap in the face of the U.S. 
President may have been Beijing's unsuitable attempt to maintain 
stability, to get to grips with the social tensions. These are 
permanently aggravated by corruption, rural exodus, horrendous 
inflation and crime rates -- the other side of a booming economy. 
  During the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is expected in the Chinese capital. He may severely 
criticize China's human rights policy, but afterwards they will 
come to an arrangement again. There is too much at stake for 
both sides: It is a matter of economic interests. And in this 
case, moral principles do not stand much chance in the first 
place.

<F P=106> [Petra Kolonko analysis: "An Image Question for Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, Mar -- In June, U.S. President Clinton 
will decide on the further granting of the most-favored-nation 
status in trade with China. As Clinton decided last year, China 
will only keep the trade privilege if it makes clear progress in 
respecting human rights. Secretary of State Christopher will 
come to Beijing on Friday [11 March] to point that out. If the 
U.S. President deprived the PRC of most-favored-nation status, 
this would badly hurt the Chinese economy. More than one-third 
of China's exports goes to the United States. The U.S. market 
is so important for the Chinese that it has recently been 
possible to wrest significant trade policy concessions from them. 
  On the issue of human rights, however, only a few 
concessions 
have been made. The latest arrests of prominent dissidents and 
the new religious laws shortly before Christopher's visit and 
the session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva have the 
affect of a provocation. Beijing has rejected reproaches from 
Western governments and accusations from human rights 
organizations. It rejects a combination of trade and human 
rights questions as interference in its internal affairs. The 
Chinese Government refers to cultural differences and says that 
other standards have to be applied in a developing country than 
in industrial states. At the same time, it uses the attraction 
of the big Chinese market to canvass for the most-favored-nation 
status. If China is deprived of most-favored-nation status, the 
U.S. economy will be hit more than that of China, Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji recently claimed in Japan. 
  The most important demands of the U.S. President are: 
freedom 
to leave the country and prevention of the export of goods 
produced in prisons; access to political prisoners and 
information on them; permitting foreign radio and television 
programs in China; respect for Tibet's cultural and religious 
heritage. 
  For the communist leadership it is a matter of national 
"image" that one must not give in to U.S. pressure and tolerate 
interference. Opinions on the extent of minor concessions 
regarding human rights are divided. This conclusion can be 
drawn from the present to-and-fro regarding arrests, releases, 
statements, and denials. While party leaders who are prepared 
for reforms are in favor of releasing selected dissidents and 
other gestures of goodwill, the conservatives take action 
against dissidents. 
  However, the behavior of the government can also be 
explained 
by domestic policy pressure. China is facing a change in 
leadership. Judging from the latest pictures, old Deng Xiaoping 
is no longer able to determine policies. One believes that his 
days are numbered. In the critical transition period, 
differences of opinion within the party are hushed up according 
to the old-communist pattern to present a picture of unity to 
the outside. At the same time, it is intended to prevent 
opposition right from the start. In the party leadership, which 
fears every political movement in China, however small it may 
be, there is a general nervousness that goes beyond 
parliamentary groups. The three arrested dissidents had planned 
to send a petition to the National People's Congress in which 
they advocated, above all, workers' rights. When they were 
arrested, signatures for the petition were collected. So far, it 
has not become known whether the arrests are only connected with 
the petition or whether the three men whose arrests were 
confirmed by the Chinese Government are also accused of other 
things. The petition does not make any revolutionary demands. 
The activists are saying that they are not doing anything that 
violates Chinese laws. 
  However, the party leadership points out that in 1989 the 
protests also started with open letters and a petition at the 
time of the convention of the National People's Congress. One 
month later, the students were demonstrating in the streets of 
Beijing. It is unlikely that a political movement might 
currently meet with such a response. However, the party does 
not want to take any risk. Then considerations regarding 
international repercussions of oppression recede into the 
background. 
  Moreover, the Chinese Government doubts the U.S. 
determination to really push through their conditions. China 
knows that there is a strong economic lobby in the United States 
that advocates the prolongation of most-favored-nation status. 
The U.S. Government also gives different signals. While the 
human rights commissioner discussed political oppression in 
Beijing last week, an envoy of the U.S. Department of Commerce 
tried at the same time to procure Chinese orders valued at 
billions [currency not specified] for the U.S. economy.

  [Text] Paris, March 10 (AFP) -- More than 12,000 
banner-waving students marched here on Thursday [10 March] 
demanding that the government drop plans to cut the minimum 
legal wage for young people. 
  The university and high school students paraded through the 
city's Left Bank carrying banners reading "Equal pay for equal 
work." 
  The demonstration was mainly peaceful but between 500 and 
1,000 youths, some of them masked and armed with clubs, broke 
away from the main march near the Montparnasse Tower and smashed 
shop windows, cars and telephone booths. 
  They tried to break into a shopping complex, but the doors 
had been locked. Police said they were trying to surround and 
arrest the violent protestors. 
  Hundreds of other demonstrators staged a sit-in on a main 
boulevard. 
  The marchers demanded that the conservative government of 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur withdraw its measures 
completely, although Balladur has watered them down 
considerably. 
  Several thousand students also staged demonstrations in the 
French provinces, at Dunkerque in the north, 
Charleville-Mezieres, Besancon, Belfort, Vesoul and Montbeliard 
in the east and at Bayonne in the south-west. 
  One of the march organisers, Philippe Campinchi, president 
of 
the socialist student union UNEF-ID, called on all Parisians to 
join in. "Workers, youths, jobless, come and join us," he said, 
and called for a strike Friday in all high schools. 
  Campinchi met with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy earlier 
on 
Thursday. "The minister did a lot of explaining, but he did not 
give way on the essential which is abrogation of the decrees" 
announcing the new measures, Campinchi said. 
  Initially the government planned to allow firms to recruit 
youths at less than the minimum take-home pay of 880 dollars a 
month whatever their qualifications, in an attempt to cut 
unemployment. 
  But it backed down in negotiations with the trade unions, 
saying holders of university degrees or certain diplomas would 
be paid 80 percent of the going rate set by collective agreement 
in the various sectors of industry, provided arrangements were 
made for training of the youths. 
  No one with a diploma would in any case get less than the 
minimum wage, the government conceded. 
  The communist-led CGT [General Confederation of Labor] trade 
union is planning its own demonstrations here and in the 
provinces next Saturday. 
  With French unemployment standing at a record 3.3 million or 
12.2 percent, employers and conservatives say the minimum wage 
is excessive and a major structural impediment to job creation. 
  Students and unions had charged that the Balladur proposals 
would allow employers to simply replace existing workers with 
more educated youths at lower wages.

Beatrice Taupin and Jean-Louis Validire; place and date not 
given: "Michel Giraud: The Five-Year Law Is in Line With the 
Measures Taken in Other Countries"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [FIGARO] The G-7 is to devote 
its Detroit summit to the question of employment. What views 
does France wish to share with the other members on this subject? 
  [Giraud] The seven major industrialized countries meeting in 
Detroit will exchange views on the measures they are taking to 
counter unemployment which is affecting everyone. A year since 
the idea of a G-7 meeting on employment was proposed, I have 
seen a degree of convergence in views and proposals. All the 
industrialized countries are concentrating on in-depth, 
structural, and medium-term measures. These consist of reducing 
the overall cost of poorly qualified labor in order to fight 
youth unemployment; substantial reform of the relationship 
between education and industry through the development of 
alternating work and study schemes and vocational training 
programs; the modernization of labor regulations allowing 
greater flexibility in working time and the development of 
part-time work; and the reorganization of employment services 
with a view to making them more efficient. 
  Whether we are talking about the OECD report, the white 
paper 
adopted by the European Council at the end of the last year, or 
the draft law to be proposed by President Clinton, the direction 
taken is the same in every case. The interest for France and, I 
hope, for all the G-7 countries lies in the fact that these 
measures coincide with those proposed in our five-year law on 
labor, employment, and vocational training. 
  [FIGARO] Is it not paradoxical that this meeting will focus 
only on the microeconomic aspects of the problem when a 
coordination of macroeconomic policies would seem essential? 
  [Giraud] It is true that the G-7 has traditionally been a 
forum for macroeconomic concertation. This unprecedented 
meeting is, nevertheless, the sign that the public authorities 
are becoming increasingly aware not only of the interaction 
between macroeconomics and microeconomics, but also of the fact 
that the latter cannot be neglected in favor of the former. It 
is a good sign that this trend is now being observed in the 
industrialized countries. We need time and effort, as well as 
good will, for this point to get through to the leaders of all 
the countries in the world. The end of the ideological 
confrontation that has dominated the world stage for 
three-quarters of a century gives us the opportunity and even 
the duty to once again put the individual at the center of 
society's concerns. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 9 (AFP) -- France reminded Germany 
Wednesday [9 March] of the role played by its Western allies in 
the fall of the Berlin Wall, a day after Bonn refused to allow 
allied forces to hold a parade before leaving Berlin in 
September. 
  "France, like its allies, wishes to give these departure 
ceremonies all the importance linked to a military presence that 
contributed to the fall of the Berlin Wall" in November 1989, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Richard Duque said. 
  He was reacting to German Chancelor Helmut Kohl's decision 
earlier that no military parade should be held when American, 
British and French troops withdraw from the east German city in 
September. 
  Diplomatic sources in Bonn said Kohl's decision stemmed from 
"internal and external pressure," and may be linked to the 
German government being miffed at not having been invited to 
join ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the allied 
landing on Normandy beaches on June 6.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gerard Longuet, Republican Party president </F>
and minister of industry, post, and telecommunications, and 
foreign trade, by Paul Guilbert and Joseph Mace-Scaron; place 
and date not given: "The Lack of Economic Growth Forces Us To 
Implement Reform" -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction] 
  [Excerpt] Gerard Longuet defends the philosophy which led 
to the establishment of the youth vocational training contract 
(CIP). He says he is convinced that cohabitation has not 
prevented the government from introducing reforms. Furthermore, 
he thinks that the current period of zero growth is forcing it 
to implement reform. With regard to the presidential election, 
the PR president is convinced that organizing primaries within 
the majority offers the Right the advantage of having a 
candidate backed by everybody right from the first round. 
Finally, with regard to the European elections, he favors a 
single majority list led by Jean-Francois Deniau. 
  [LE FIGARO] Was the youth vocational training contract 
clumsily presented to the public, or was it in fact questionable? 
  [Longuet] Everybody has to accept reponsibilities. The CIP 
is a result of the five-year law, which was preceded by a 
lengthy parliamentary debate and by long negotiations between 
the government, employers, and trade unions. Specific clauses 
of the CIP contracts were amended one or more times, or 
renegotiated. Thus the text we have now is the result of a real 
social debate and a thorough legislative process, no rush 
decision out of the blue. It is one element of a strategy 
designed to tackle an undeniable problem: the growth of youth 
unemployment, especially among those under 26. 
  We felt absolute priority had to be given to youngsters who 
have never worked before. In my opinion -- as a parent too -- 
there are no two ways about this. For those without any 
training, the CIP constitutes an undeniable step forward 
compared to previous reforms, both for industry and for the 
youngsters involved: for industry, because exemptions are 
clearly defined, the regulations are much simpler, and there are 
no particular constraints on hiring -- companies can really open 
their doors wide to youngsters. The CIP is a stepping stone for 
youngsters, allowing them to get their foot inside a company's 
door. 
  What I demand in this period of crisis is the right to 
experiment. I am shocked by the obstacles encountered in our 
society. Youth unemployment is a real drama for all of us, but 
one is not allowed to touch minimum wages or the hierarchy of 
diplomas. I fear the students have won a Pyrrhic victory: They 
have safeguarded the theoretical value of their diplomas, but 
they are shutting a gateway to industry. 
  [LE FIGARO] Did you expect that sort of reaction? 
  [Longuet] I am not responsible for the CIP issue. The decree 
was prepared with a view to getting it approved as fast as 
possible. 
  [LE FIGARO] This issue, together with the abrogation of the 
Falloux law, raise a fundamental question: Is it possible to 
reform, to experiment, in a period of cohabitation? 
  [Longuet] Reforms are possible in a situation of 
cohabitation. We have introduced and are introducing reforms. 
For instance, we reformed the retirement system. We are 
reforming contractual relationships within the health insurance 
system. In my ministry we have privatized Elf and 
Rhone-Poulenc; we passed a law against counterfeiting; we 
reorganized Bull; and we negotiated the GATT agreement. So 
reforms are possible in France. But everything is difficult; 
any reform is exacting. The real question should be: Are 
reforms possible in a period of zero growth? 
  Personally, I think that the absence of growth compels us to 
implement reform. If we were in a period of growth, certain 
problems would automatically disappear. The government is 
sparing with its reforms, but not with essential reforms. 
  [LE FIGARO] Are there not two periods in a situation of 
cohabitation: first, an observation period; and, second, the 
period preceding the presidential elections, during which 
reforms seem difficult to introduce? 
  [Longuet] We have a responsibility toward our electorate, 
which voted for a program. I am surprised that anyone can 
harbor resentment against a majority for being consistent with 
its commitments, especially in extremely urgent cases. Youth 
unemployment is a problem requiring reforms. Can you think of 
any government which would not, of its own free will and because 
it is its duty, tackle problems affecting public opinion?

<F P=106> [Report by Eric Zemmour: "Majority: Deniau (Probably) Head </F>
of List"] 
  [Text] A four-part plan for two parties, and a few taboos. 
In the European plan which the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and 
UDF [Union for French Democracy] unanimously adopted yesterday, 
some words are prohibited: Maastricht is one of them, but also 
federal and single currency. It is the RPR which had these 
reservations but it did not find it difficult to persuade its 
UDF partner. The campaign on the Maastricht Treaty was recalled 
and the threat of Philippe de Villiers' [anti-Maastricht] list 
is taken very seriously, especially in the Republican Party. 
  Of course, fundamentally the situation is still the same: 
The Maastricht Treaty, even rechristened "Treaty on Union," has 
been adopted by the French people. It it therefore binding on 
everybody, particularly with the single- currency objective 
which lies at the heart of it. At the UDF yesterday, some 
people still expressed surprise at the change in an RPR which 
accepts without flinching an expression such as: "The 
strengthening of economic union will precede the full 
implementation of monetary union which establishes the 
transition to the third stage in 1997 or 1999." 
  The same rapid agreement was reached with regard to 
combating 
the Brussels Commission's encroachments on the rights of hunters 
or placing a series of safeguards on the implementation of the 
Schengen accord -- the establishment of a reliable computer 
system, the coordination of immigration control policies, and 
the harmonization of legislation on illegal drugs. 
  Similarly, a European trade policy could not ruin the 
edifice. Having given unanimous approval to the conclusion of 
the GATT agreement by the Balladur government, the RPR and UDF 
would have looked ridiculous if they had allowed disagreements 
on this subject to appear. They therefore developed a balanced 
concept of "free trade" which does not mean "laxness and 
indifference." A perusal of the document even reveals a 
discreet but deliberate tribute from Giscard to Juppe on "the 
favorable conclusion of the GATT negotiations." 
  This had all been settled back on 8 February, the date of 
the 
last meeting between the RPR and UDF delegations. Two subjects 
remained to be discussed in the last two negotiating sessions: 
military affairs and institutional matters. The RPR finally 
obtained its 100,000-strong European intervention force while 
the UDF gained acceptance for the idea, so dear to Giscard, of a 
president of the European Council appointed by the Council for 
five years. 
  Everybody was in agreement on the need for strict controls 
on 
the Brussels Commission, first by the Parliament and also by the 
Council. On 8 February, Giscard had sovereignly decreed: "The 
Commission is a general secretariat." One last minor difference 
then separated the RPR and UDF negotiators: The latter wanted 
the Council, like parliament, to be able to censure the 
Commission. But this very parliamentary expression was too 
reminiscent of a federal-style system in which the Commission, 
the de facto executive power, is subject to the control of a 
lower house -- the Parliament -- and an upper house, a kind of 
Senate of the federated states -- the Council. On this point 
too, refraining once again from any provocation of public 
opinion and the electorate, the UDF accepted the more neutral 
expression of "ending the Commission's mandate." 
  "Europe is back in the Union," UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre 
Raffarin said with satisfaction yesterday. The die was cast 
from the moment when Giscard and Chirac decided not to expose 
their differences to the public and to Edouard Balladur, their 
common enemy. All that remains now is to find somebody to head 
the list. Some people in the RPR have not entirely given up 
Alain Juppe as a candidate. However, it seems that Jacques 
Chirac is ready to concede the position as head of list to the 
UDF once again. Speaking on the France 2 news program yesterday 
evening, Giscard barely concealed the fact that he already had 
Chirac's agreement: "I think that our partners are very open on 
this subject." The UDF would therefore have to choose between 
Jean-Francois Deniau and Dominique Baudis, which it would do at 
its meeting on 30 March in order to spare the joint National 
Council meeting on 7 April the torments of choice and division. 
In these circumstances, it is difficult to imagine the head of 
list being other than Jean-Francois Deniau, the Republican Party 
candidate, although some people in the RPR and UDF are already 
demanding "an effective head of list."

<F P=106> [Report signed "J.-M.C.": "LE MONDE's Special Envoy Not </F>
Wanted in Tunisia"] 
  [Text] Through the Tunisian External Communication Agency 
(ATCE), the Tunisian authorities recently informed Jacques de 
Barrin, LE MONDE's special envoy who was preparing to visit 
their country to cover the 20 March presidential and 
parliamentary elections, that he was not wanted in Tunisia and 
that, if he tried to enter the country, he would be turned back. 
  Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Tunisian 
authorities hounding "malicious media." In the past few weeks, 
the BBC correspondent was expelled from Tunisia, while KUNA, the 
Kuwaiti News Agency, narrowly avoided having its local office 
closed. And what can be said about the many problems facing our 
Tunisian colleagues in exercising their profession, because 
they, just like the special envoys of the foreign media, are 
forced to work under close surveillance. What can be said also 
about the refusal to sell foreign newspapers, including LE 
MONDE, when their content is judged to be hostile. 
  Does the struggle against religious fundamentalism justify 
the country's political life being suspended and the government 
being afraid of its own shadow? The resulting image does not 
fit with the one intended by the man who, in removing Habib 
Bourguiba from power on 7 November 1987, presented himself to 
his fellow citizens as "the man of change."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Procrastination"] </F>
  [Text] The ministers of the Twelve and their Austrian, 
Finnish, and Swedish counterparts, who last week were clinking 
their champaign glasses because they thought the path of 
enlargement wide open, today are coming down a peg. There is 
not only the accord with Norway which is still clashing with the 
fisheries dossier, but also the Twelve's inability to agree on a 
joint position with regard to the decisionmaking process in the 
expanded Union. The latter threatens to endanger the current 
timetable, in other words, to postpone enlargement beyond the 
planned date of 1 January 1995. The British and the Spanish, 
intent on a better protection of their national interests, want 
a blocking minority that can more easily be reached than today; 
the other 10 member states, including France, have an opposite 
viewpoint and want to avoid a more cumbersome decisionmaking 
process in the expanded Europe. The failure, which is 
indicative of EU [European Union] frictions, is not yet 
definitive: A new meeting has been planned on 15 March and, if 
the Twelve find back to path of compromise, everything may still 
work out well. 
  This dispute, however, indicates how hazardous it is to 
pursue an enlargement of the Union without having previously 
defined its goals and operational procedures. This precipitance 
was deliberate on the part of the EU heads of state and 
government, who are not really inclined to foment a difficult 
debate at home until the contrary winds emanating from public 
opinion as a result of the Maastricht Treaty have dropped. 
  The Commission did not have the courage to oppose this 
procrastination which plays into the hands of the opponents of a 
federal Europe. Thus, the British rather favor an enlargement 
-- including the four European Free Trade Organization countries 
today, and the central European countries at a later date -- 
which would virtually annihilate the political links provided 
for in the Rome and Maastricht treaties and thrust the Union 
into the direction of a free trade zone. 
  France did not want to oppose enlargement. It first 
advocated institutional reforms to accompany the enlargement 
process, but it renounced them in face of its partners' 
opposition, thus giving the impression that it did not know 
where it was going nor even were it wanted to go. Thus, the 
playing ground is now open to those, especially in Germany, who 
do no longer believe in the possibility of a political union in 
Europe. 
  For 40 years, the French have orchestrated European 
construction -- sometimes maybe in a way irritating others. 
Their current failure creates a malaise, all the more so since 
it is suspected to be due to conceptual impotence. Political 
determination is often necessary, and, as we have seen during 
the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia issue, no only at the 
implementation the level.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Latest Poll: Democratic Party of </F>
the Left in the Lead"] 
  [Excerpt] Rome -- Another day, umpteenth opinion poll, new 
result. This time it is Directa's turn, which, for the 
proportional vote, sees a tight victory for the PDS [Democratic 
Party of the Left] (21.2 percent) over Forza Italia (20.8 
percent), which is in a downward trend. 
  The researchers observe a slight revival for the Northern 
League (10.3 percent), whereas the Italian Popular Party [PPI] 
with 11.2 percent, the Pact for Italy with 6.2 percent, and the 
National Alliance with 9.8 percent remain more or less stable. 
The Greens (5 percent) and the Communist Renewal (4.8 percent) 
pass the 4 percent threshold. Thus, the ecologists are 
boasting: "In the battle of the opinion polls, which are very 
instrumental and hardly scientific, there finally are some data 
rendering the truth." On the other hand, the Democratic 
Alliance (3.4 percent), Rete (3.3 percent), and the Pannella 
list (2.2 percent) remain under the threshold which allows entry 
into parliament. 
  According to Directa, these results "can still change 
dramatically given the effects of the election campaign on the 
undecided voters." The percentage of undecided voters decreased 
from 60.4 to 36.4, which, 18 days from the elections, is still a 
very high figure. 
  Directa interviewed by telephone 1,527 voters scattered over 
85 small, medium-sized, and large communities, covering a sample 
representative of gender and age, divided along four 
geographical areas and four sizes of city towns. The 
interviewees were asked: "In the proportional election scheme 
for the Chamber of Deputies, you will vote for a party and not 
for a candidate; for which party have you decided to vote?" A 
total of 971 of the interviewees, i.e., 63.6 percent, replied.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In the Uninominal Constituencies </F>
Forza Italia Will Not Win"] 
  [Text] In the uninominal constituencies 35 percent of the 
electorate will vote for a progressive candidate. The Forza 
Italia candidates will acquire only 3 percent; this figure will 
rise to 17 percent in case the Snake's [Berlusconi nickname] 
people run with the National Alliance, and to 21 percent when 
they align with the Northern League. The centrists will obtain 
16 percent, Pannella 1 percent, and the others 2 percent. These 
are the results of an opinion poll commissioned by TG5 [fifth 
channel TV news] with CIRM [Italian Center for Market Research], 
which interviewed 2,077 voters. In the proportional voting the 
first party is Forza Italia with 29 percent, followed by the PDS 
[Democratic Party of the Left] with 20 percent. The undecided 
voters are at 28 percent, whereas 44 percent confirm to have 
made a definitive choice. However, 36 percent says that they 
might still change their minds. 
  This uncertainty is confirmed by the researchers of 
Datamedia 
and Noima di Accademia who questioned a sample of 6,174 people. 
Approximately 40 percent still do not know yet for whom to 
vote. However, the researchers instead wanted to know "what" 
they will vote for, "how" they are making up their minds, and 
"how much" their choice was influenced by the media. On these 
issues, 46.1 percent believe that television is the most 
reliable source, 15.3 percent the newspapers, 1.5 percent the 
magazines, 0.9 percent the radio, 0.7 percent books, 27.4 
percent personal knowledge, and 3.6 percent one's friends.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Rome RAI Uno Television Network in 
Italian at 2215 GMT on 8 March carries a 15-minute interview 
with Pact for Italy Leader Mario Segni by Bruno Vespa, in a 
special election program. The program also includes a 
five-minute talk by pundit Giovanni Sartori about the meaning of 
the term "liberal-democracy." 
  Mario Segni starts by saying that Vespa and the media as a 
whole does not seem to realize that as far as the 
first-past-the-post part of the general elections are concerned, 
the Pact for Italy is a unified alliance of which the Italian 
Popular Party [PPI], and the Italian Republican Party [PRI], are 
members. He explaines that for the purposes of the proportional 
representation part of the election, the alliance will split in 
two: the PPI and the Segni Pact, which includes the PRI among 
its members. 
  Quoting the Pact for Italy manifesto, Vespa asks Segni how 
he 
intends to create a million new jobs over three years. Segni 
answers that unemployment is largely linked to the overall 
economic climate and that the important thing is to aim for zero 
inflation. He says that the state's role is to draw up 
large-scale plans for investing in infrastructure, and that Pact 
for Italy experts have calculated that a 100,000 billion lire 
investment over three years, largely paid for by the private 
sector, would enable the government to rebuild the economy and 
create jobs. Unemployed people would also be encouraged to 
invest in small businesses. 
  Segni says that the Pact for Italy would not reduce taxes 
immediately, because the public deficit would have to be taken 
care of before this became possible. The Pact for Italy would 
not, however, increase the tax burden. More money would be 
raised by fighting tax evasion which would make it possible to 
reduce taxes in the longer term. 
  Segni says that free health care should continue to be 
provided for poorer people, but that private health care and 
pension plans should be encouraged. Segni also reiterates that 
his party would not join a government coalition with either the 
Left or the Right, and in particular that there is no basis for 
believing that the pact would rather arrange a deal with Achille 
Occhetto's Progressive Alliance after the elections.

  [Text] Naples -- "In case the left alliance wins, this 
would be a misfortune; in case the right alliance wins, this 
would be just as much a misfortune." In that way Italian 
Popular Party Secretary [PPI] Mino Martinazzoli replied to 
questions about how he viewed the outcome of the upcoming 
elections. "I feel irritated because attempts are being made to 
convince the Italians that there are only two competitors. 
However, the discussions going on within both alignments 
exactly serve to outline the reasons of our existence. The 
Italians are not as careless as one thinks, and they are not 
stupid either." 
  The PPI secretary also talked about the document signed by 
the centrist leaders protesting against the treatment that TV 
programs have reserved for their position: "I signed it with 
unruffled indignation. If they showed the Italians what is 
happening behind the doors, they would understand the deception 
that ongoing. If someone put stockings in front of a TV camera 
as a filter, it means that he is ready for a performance, and 
not for a dialogue with the people."

<F P=106> [Mariano Guindal report: "Solbes Calls For National </F>
Agreement in Order To Be Able To Reduce Public Deficit"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Finance Minister Pedro Solbes yesterday 
called for a national agreement in order to limit demands on the 
state and in this way be able to reduce the large public 
deficit. According to him, controlling the deficit is an 
essential factor for boosting and consolidating the new economic 
cycle, which "has undoubtedly now begun." 
  The minister issued two messages during an important lecture 
on "economic policy and the new situation" delivered at the 21st 
Century Club yesterday evening. In the first place, the 
government's priority and pressing task is to contain public 
expenditure and deregulate the telecommunications sector, "which 
is taking shape as the driving force of the next cycle of 
growth." 
  Second, Pedro Solbes stated that the government's economic 
policy will be based on encouraging investment and exports. The 
minister was emphatic in asserting that the mistake will not be 
made of artificially stimulating consumption by lowering taxes, 
as the People's Party demands, or increasing wages, as the 
United Left and the trade unions demand. 
  The minister emphasized that there is no longer any doubt 
that economic recovery has begun. "It now seems generally 
accepted by the experts that there are clear and sufficient 
signs to say that we have begun the change of economic cycle." 
The economy performed favorably in the fourth quarter of the 
year, breaking the downward trend. The rate of industrial 
output is beginning to show positive figures. Car sales are 
beginning to recover, and the number of new enterprises is 
growing. 
  To ensure that this trend can be consolidated over the next 
few months, the government deems it essential to reduce the 
public deficit and improve enterprises' competitiveness. 
According to him, the forecast state deficit for this year 
exceeds 3 trillion pesetas, which represents just over 5 percent 
of GDP. Hence the public deficit does not yet exceed the 
interest which the state is paying on the public debt in 
circulation, which this year will stand at 4.5 trillion pesetas. 
  Solbes was emphatic in asserting that it is essential to 
stop 
at this point. "The danger of a self-sustaining deficit process 
could come about very quickly unless we act extremely firmly. 
If we do not do so, traumatic solutions would be required, as 
has happened in other countries." 
  In order to achieve this, there is a need for "an agreement 
among everybody in order to limit our demands on the state. 
Together with this, it is clearly necessary to wage a more 
effective struggle against every kind of fraud -- not just tax 
fraud -- and improve administration." 
  Pedro Solbes reflected on the nature of the public deficit, 
pointing out that "it undoubtedly occurs because the state is 
spending more than it raises, but the state spends on those 
policies which the public demand of it -- whether it be on 
health, education, unemployment, or roads -- and raises what the 
country's wealth permits and what people are socially prepared 
to tolerate as a tax burden. The state's expenditure on its own 
functioning as an administration barely exceeds 3.5 percent of 
total expenditure." 
  The minister pointed out that the state will owe 60 percent 
of GDP at the end of the year -- that is, over 36 trillion 
pesetas. This debt attracts interest which now represents 16 
percent of total expenditure. Hence it has become the item on 
which we spend most after paying pensions. He stated that "the 
public deficit occurs because the public demand more of the 
state than they themselves are prepared to contribute. Hence a 
supportive austerity effort is necessary for the next three 
years." According to him, the economic recovery will not be 
enough to rebalance public accounts. 
  The second element of the new economic policy -- "those who 
continue to demand a change in economic policy are unable to 
recognize that this change has already occurred" -- is improving 
enterprises' competitiveness. In his opinion, the devaluation 
of the peseta and the reform of the labor market were two key 
elements for achieving this, "but we must continue to work in 
two other directions -- continuing with the structural reforms 
and promoting stable and lasting restraint in earned and 
unearned incomes." 
  With respect to the deregulation of the telecommunications 
sector, he stated that over the next few months the necessary 
decisions must be taken in order to prevent Spain's being left 
out of that process which is now mobilizing very considerable 
resources in the United States and Europe. "An early decision 
on this matter will have very positive effects on investment and 
employment, and will make it possible to reduce inflation."

<F P=106> [Javier R. Ventosa report: "Spain Rejected German Leopard </F>
Tank Purchase Offer"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The German authorities recently offered a 
consignment of Leopard tanks to Spain, which did not even 
consider the offer, believing that its stock is already 
sufficient, according to Defense Ministry sources. 
  The informal offer was made during the Spanish-German summit 
held in Granada at the end of November, in which the two 
countries' defense ministers took part, meeting again in Bonn a 
few weeks later. 
<H5>  Almost Free of Charge </H5>
  Although specific details of the offer have not leaked out, 
it apparently involved several dozen Leopard-1 tanks -- some 
circles speak of 300 -- which were to be destroyed or withdrawn 
from Germany as a result of the conventional disarmament treaty, 
which limits the tanks of all European countries. The terms for 
their sale were virtually free of charge. 
  The Spanish Army had been keenly interested for some time in 
Leopard tanks in order to renew its aged armored vehicle stock, 
although the Defense Ministry sources consulted stated that the 
latest German offer "came too late," since Spain has already 
renewed its stock since 1993 with the arrival of 300 U.S. M60 
tanks. 
  Moreover, receiving German technology would necessitate 
changing the Spanish Army's maintenance and logistic systems, 
which are geared to the U.S. equipment. In this connection, 
reliable sources state that the German offer's ultimate aim 
could have been a commercial motive; the creation of a "captive 
market" in Spain which would necessitate purchasing all the 
spare parts in Germany. 
  Since 1992, Spain's armored vehicle stock has undergone a 
transformation as a result of the implementation of the 
conventional disarmament treaty. Spain had 854 tanks (375 
M47's, 180 M48's, and 299 AMX-30's), and the conventional 
disarmament treaty set the Spanish Army a ceiling of 794 tanks, 
so it had to destroy just 60 in order not to exceed that limit. 
The decision to accept 420 surplus U.S. tanks in Europe raised 
Spain's stock to 1,264, with the consequent need to destroy 480. 
  The Army later discarded 110 of the 420 M60's, although it 
still needed to destroy the 480 surplus tanks, so Spain's 
armored vehicle stock was finally put at 684 tanks (310 M60's, 
already received, 164 M48's, and 210 AMX-30's), with the 
possibility of increasing it by 110, to reach the ceiling set by 
the conventional disarmament treaty. 
  Out of the 480 tanks to be destroyed or disabled, the 
Spanish 
Army has now discarded 120 tanks between September and November 
1993. The other 360 -- mostly ancient M47's -- are to be 
disabled before November 1995.

  [Text] [Announcer] Today Minister of Interior Antoni 
Asuncion met democratic political groups to inform them about 
antiterrorism policy. For state security reasons, this meeting 
was held behind closed doors and what was said is secret. 
However, after the meeting, some of the data the minister put 
forward, data about ETA's infrastructure, became known. 
  The terrorist group now has 10 active commandos: five of 
them 
are of the so-called illegal type, that is people already known 
to the police; four of the legal kind, that is people without 
police records; and one support commando who is active in 
Guipuzcoa. This information was leaked by one of the deputies 
present at the meeting. 
  The Ministry of the Interior has refused to confirm or 
comment on the leak because the issue was dealt with at a secret 
meeting linked to state security. Over to our reporter Blanca 
Zabala. 
  [Zabala] Right now the terrorist organization ETA has a 
total 
of nine commandos of which five carry out the attacks. 
According to the police, they are located in Madrid, Barcelona, 
Guipuzcoa, Vizcaya and along the southeast coast. Three 
commandos collect information in Guipuzcoa and Navarre. And 
finally one commando providing logistical support. This one is 
located in Guipuzcoa. Furthermore, the commando in Alava is in 
the process of being reorganized. 
  This data about ETA's current strength was provided by 
Minister of the Interior Antoni Asuncion to the meeting of the 
representatives of the political parties which signed the pact 
against terrorism. Normally what is said at such meetings is 
considered secret but today the press was given this information 
by one of the parliamentarians who attended. 
  At the end of the meeting, the minister said that revulsion 
towards terrorism grows day by day. 
  [Begin Asuncion recording] There is a very marked difference 
in the civil society environment around Herri Batasuna [ETA's 
political wing], KAS [Patriotic Socialist Coordinating 
Committee], and platforms that have organized themselves as 
associations which oppose violence. [end recording] 
  [Zabala] Both the minister and party representatives said 
the 
antiterrorist pact has been strenghtened by this meeting and 
there is still a consensus on this issue. 
  Referring to the rehabilitation of ETA prisoners, Asuncion 
added there will not be a blanket solution for all the 
prisoners, each case will be treated on its merits as it has 
been done until now.

Multimillion-Kroner Loan To Rescue Faeroes' Unemployment Fund"] 
  [Text] The Faeroes' unemployment fund needs additional 
capital again. The fund will be exhausted this month. The unions 
are threatening to resign from the administration of the fund if 
conditions worsen for the unemployed. 
  Torshavn -- The Faeroes' depleted unemployment fund must be 
rescued by a new multimillion-kroner loan. 
  This decision, reached by a committee set up in the Faeroes, 
could mean that within the next few days the Faeroese government 
will apply to the Danish Government for permission to take out a 
loan of between 40 and 50 million kroner for the purpose of 
supporting unemployed local inhabitants. 
  There are so many jobless people in the Faeroes that the 
unemployment fund pays out far more money in support than it 
receives. In February the fund will once more be exhausted. 
  The committee, made up of members of the Faeroes' coalition 
government parties, decided to recommend leaving the 
unemployment payment rules as they are and offsetting the 
shortfall by taking out a loan of between 40 and 50 million 
kroner. That should be enough to support the jobless in the 
Faeroes for the rest of the year. This assumes that the 
unemployed will continue to be allowed to remain enrolled in the 
fund for 24 months instead of cutting the enrollment period to 
15 months, as some have proposed. 
  Johannes Eidesgaard, the Faeroes' government member 
responsible for social and labor issues, said that he intends to 
start by applying to the local banks and savings institutions 
because they should assume their share of the responsibility for 
the jobless in the Faeroes. However, if the Lagting [Faeroese 
parliament] must also guarantee the loan, it will be necessary 
for both the Lagting and the Danish Government to give their 
approval. 
  In connection with the loan agreements that Denmark and the 
Faeroes have reached, the Danish Government has stipulated not 
only that the accounts of the Faeroes' unemployment fund must be 
balanced, but also that the unemployment system must not be 
provided with money via the Faeroese budget. This requirement is 
one of the reasons why the unions in the Faeroes have proposed 
that local labor market issues be made a joint national affair 
so that Denmark has a responsibility to ensure that the 
unemployed in the Faeroes have the same conditions as Danes who 
are out of work. 
  The trade unions in the Faeroes have threatened to resign 
from the administration of the unemployment fund if conditions 
deteriorate for unemployed people there.

  [Text] The Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety 
is dismissing the reports of a leak at a nuclear power station 
in Kola yesterday as incorrect. The Center for Radiation and 
Nuclear Safety says that it has been in telephone contact with 
the nuclear power station in Kola. The station's chief engineer 
said nothing exceptional had taken place in the station this 
week. The German news agency DPA and AFP of France, quoting 
ITAR-TASS, reported that the third reactor at the Kola nuclear 
power station had had to be closed down. The reason given was 
unusual steam in the station building.

  [Excerpts] Preliminary approaches have been made to Finland 
concerning the transfer of the Finnish peacekeepers in The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to Tuzla in 
Bosnia. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto confirms that an 
unofficial inquiry has been received from the United Nations and 
the matter is currently being studied. 
  [Begin Haavisto recording] For the time being it is a very 
preliminary contact. It seems that the United States will be 
sending more peacekeepers than before to the territory of former 
Yugoslavia and apparently they would like to station them in 
FYROM. The question has been raised whether consideration could 
be given to the possibility that the post of the Nordic 
battalion there might be changed. [passage omitted] [end 
recording] 
  Finland's current law on peacekeeping prevents Finnish 
soldiers from being sent to the warring Bosnia. Now people are 
waiting to see whether a debate will resume on amending the 
peacekeeping law. At least Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn is in 
favor of increasing the peacekeepers' right to self-defense that 
would make it possible to send them to Tuzla, for instance.

  [Text] Finland will send more peacekeepers to the former 
Yugoslavia. The Defense Ministry reports that a group of 39 
guard soldiers will travel to Pleso near Zagreb, the capital of 
Croatia, in just under a week. The Finns will start guarding 
the Pleso base and airport. So far, the Nordic peacekeepers in 
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] have guarded 
Pleso intermittently. Finland already has 230 peacekeepers in 
the area of the former Yugoslavia, in FYROM.

<F P=106> [Aslak Bonde and Hilde Harbo report: "Oyangen's Agreement </F>
Concluded Last Night"] 
  [Text] In the very early hours, Agriculture Minister 
Gunhild Oyangen was finally able to present the agricultural 
chapter of the accession agreement with the EU [European Union]. 
For the most part, it is like the agreement concluded with 
Finland last week, but there are better terms for the most 
vulnerable sector of the foodstuffs industry as well as 
regarding the scale of the permanent subsidy arrangements. 
  "We can give extra support to 85 percent of the country. The 
measures we pushed through for [the area] north of the 62d 
degree of latitude we can also give to large parts of southern 
Norway, including parts of Hedmark and Oppland, the northernmost 
parts of Buskerud and Telemark, the mountainous areas of Agder 
and Rogaland, and substantial parts of Sogn og Fjordane, and 
Hordaland." 
<H5>  Districts Safeguarded </H5>
  "This is a good agreement for Norway, one which safeguards 
what we sought to achieve all along. Employment and settlement 
in the regions has been safeguarded," said Gunhild Oyangen. 
  The agriculture minister also said that she is happy with 
the 
agreements reached on the foodstuffs industry. 
  Norway and the EU agreed on a declaration that makes 
provision for Norway to request the European Commission to 
impose a ceiling on imports of manufactured agricultural 
products. The condition is that documentary evidence can be 
provided that free imports from other EU countries are actually 
hindering the healthy reorganization of the Norwegian foodstuffs 
industry. This applies to meat, flour, canned products, animal 
feed, and most dairy products. 
  These measures will be available for use over a three-year 
period. During this time, support for restructuring will also 
be given. 
  "These measures will give us sufficient time to reorganize. 
And the important thing is that we have won understanding for 
our `better safe than sorry' principle," said Oyangen. 
  Before the agreement had been approved, none of the 
Norwegian 
negotiators had wanted to be quoted as saying that Norway had 
achieved a better deal than Finland as regards protection for 
its foodstuffs industry. Nevertheless they indicated that they 
had something positive to bring home. 
<H5>  Understanding </H5>
  Earlier yesterday, the minister of agriculture said that she 
was far from displeased with the attitude she had encountered in 
Brussels: "I would like to say that there are many here in 
Brussels who know more about Norwegian agriculture -- and have a 
greater respect for it -- than many Norwegians." 
  Yesterday Gunhild Oyangen was able to present a far more 
detailed agreement than the Finns could last week. For Finland, 
it has been unclear all along how the safety clause for the 
foodstuffs industry was meant to work. 
  This Finnish solution, which Norway was initially expected 
to 
receive a virtually identical copy of, was met by a storm of 
protests from the Norwegian foodstuffs industry. Gunhild 
Oyangen was given rough treatment when she returned home unable 
to point to Norwegian solutions that were better in practice 
than the Finnish ones. Over the last few days in Brussels, she 
and her negotiators have fought tooth and nail to gain some 
improvements. 
  "It was extremely necessary for Norway to secure durable 
solutions, because the EU's agricultural policy is not adapted 
to the circumstances in Norway," said Gunhild Oyangen. She 
noted with satisfaction that the EU has changed its agricultural 
policy as a result of the enlargement negotiations.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] So far, only Great Britain has 
responded positively to the UN request to send more soldiers to 
Bosnia. In Sweden there are discussions to move the Swedish 
company in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to 
Bosnia. This could take place quickly, but there are several 
problems; among other things, the Swedish UN soldiers must 
accept to serve in Bosnia. They have been sent on a 
peacekeeping mission in the FYROM and in Bosnia they will risk 
ending up in conflicts. 
  [Correspondent Boerje Remdahl] The question on whether to 
move the Swedish UN unit from FYROM to Bosnia is currently being 
studied by the government. The military headquarters have not 
yet received instructions to prepare the transfer of the troops 
there. Sweden, Norway, and Finland all have their rifle company 
and service and staff personnel in FYROM, and the redeployment 
now spoken about concerns the 250 Swedes, among others. The 
soldiers will be allowed to decide for themselves whether they 
want to serve in Bosnia. The task in FYROM that they signed up 
for is a peacekeeping contribution, while serving in Bosnia 
includes the risk of ending up in conflicts, despite the fact 
that there now is a cease-fire to monitor. [passage omitted] 
  The transfer of the Swedish company, or the whole battalion, 
can take place quickly provided that Sweden, Norway, and Finland 
can agree. It might be more difficult for Finland than for 
Sweden and Norway to send its soldiers from FYROM to Bosnia, 
because the Finnish Government does not accept participation in 
any other UN tasks than strictly peacekeeping operations. 
[passage omitted] 
  Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says that he expects 
a meeting of Nordic defense ministers to take place in a few 
days to discuss the UN's wishes to transfer the FYROM battalion 
to control the cease-fire in Bosnia. The tasks in FYROM can 
possibly be taken over by U.S. UN units.

  [Text] Stockholm, March 10 (AFP) -- The Swedish Government 
favours switching its UN battalion in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck said Thursday [10 March]. 
  "The American Defense Secretary William Perry contacted me 
on 
Wednesday. I think we can handle this mission," said Bjoerck 
during a military conference in Halmstad, southern Sweden. 
  No details were released on when the redeployment could take 
place. 
  "We're still working on how this will exactly happen," he 
underlined. 
  But a decision could be made quickly, without a 
parliamentary 
discussion, Bjoerck added. 
  "Parliament has given permission to send a maximum of 1,000 
men to Bosnia. There are just over 800 there now, so there is 
room to manoeuvre," he said. 
  Nordic defense ministers could meet to discuss the issue in 
the next few days, Bjoerck hinted. 
  Meanwhile Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, speaking at a 
meeting of political party leaders in Stockholm, said the issue 
would be further examined at a meeting of the advisory council 
on foreign affairs next week.

  [Text] Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special 
coordinator on Cyprus, repeated that both sides are negotiating 
seriously and constructively on the proposals for the 
confidence-building measures. However, he expressed the view 
that one cannot speak of significant progress in the 
negotiations. Speaking after a meeting with President Glavkos 
Kliridhis this morning, Lamb noted that even the people who 
oppose aspects of the confidence-building measures should 
realize that the proposals for the measures are a reality and 
that these proposals are on the negotiating table. Responding 
to a question, though, on the end-of-March deadline for 
conclusion of an agreement on the confidence-building measures, 
Lamb was unclear about maintaining it. He said that the 
procedure must advance quickly but with care. Time, he noted, 
is an important aspect but all should feel comfortable in the 
negotiations and there should be no feeling that the process 
moves hastily. The target, Lamb said, is not so much the 
deadline but for progress in the procedure as quickly as 
possible.

  [Text] Larnaca (CNA)--A phone call saying that a bomb had 
been planted on a plane going to Vienna delayed the flight of 
Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special representative on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  An unidentified man who spoke in Greek called the duty 
officer at Larnaca Airport and told him that "there is a bomb on 
the plane that will fly to Vienna." 
  The Austrian Airlines flight had just landed at the airport 
coming from Cairo. It was supposed to leave for Vienna at 1435 
today. 
  Police inspected the aircraft but found nothing suspicious. 
Following a careful inspection of the luggage and the 
passengers, which lasted for approximately one hour, the plane 
left at 1505 for its destination. 
  The U.S. coordinator handled the situation with humor. Lamb 
and the U.S. Embassy spokesman who was accompanying him remained 
in the VIP room during the inspection.

explicit manner that during the talks on the confidence-building 
measures [CBM's], the UN secretary general's representatives 
never directly or indirectly, orally or in writing, suggested 
that the Greek Cypriot side would get Famagusta's fenced-off 
area [Varosha] in exchange for recognizing the so-called Turkish 
Cypriot passports. 
  In a written statement on press reports on safe access to

from Famagusta, Kliridhis added that they have no connection to 
the UN suggestions. The president said that these press reports 
give the United Nations the impression that we are trying to

  [Text] Lefkosa, Mar. 10 (A.A.) -- Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas criticized on 
Thursday [10 March] a report of U.N. Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, on the indirect talks being held in Cyprus 
concerning the confidence-building measures. 
  In a statement from the TRNC capital, Denktas also announced 
that he had postponed a meeting scheduled for this afternoon 
with U.N. envoy Gustave Feissel, to Friday. 
  He said that he was to review the draft document given to 
him 
by the envoy, together with the prime minister and consultants. 
  "An incomphrehensible haste prevails in U.N. circles," he 
said. "This is not an issue that could be resolved in such a 
haste. Even a single word needs emphasis." 
  Denktas pointed out that the Butrus-Ghali report attributed 
a 
title to one of the sides, which is unacceptable to the other 
and that they would not accept Kliridhis being called 
"president," while he himself is referred to as "leader." 
  "The course of events are directed to support the `Cyprus 
republic' and to just mend us to it. [sentence as received] 
Therefore we shall continue to review the document put before 
us, very minutely," he said.

  [Text] The prospects for the Skopje issue [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] appear positive following 
yesterday's meeting in Geneva between UN mediator Cyrus Vance 
and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today described the 
meeting as a sure success, stressed that Vance understands the 
Greek positions, and announced that the talks between Papoulias 
and Vance will resume. It is not ruled out that Vance's 
associates will meet Greek Government officials. 
  The government spokesman also announced that a Skopjean 
delegation has been called by the European Union [EU] Commission 
and the European Parliament to participate in a pan-European 
transport conference in Crete on 14-15 March organized by the EU 
Commission and the European Parliament with the participation of 
the responsible Greek ministers who also preside over the 
respective EU councils. The Skopean delegation will be headed 
by the Assembly President Stojan Andov. The government 
spokesman noted that the Skopean delegation will participate in 
the conference under the conditions that recall the practical 
signs [of goodwill] that Greece demands from Skopje. Venizelos 
clarified that the Skopjean delegation will come to Greece with 
a visa on a plain piece of blank paper with no Star of Veryina 
in sight and with the use of the term FYROM. Venizelos added 
that no issue outside the conference framework will be raised 
and said it would not be proper for Andov to hold a news 
conference on Greek territory on issues concerning Greek-Skopje 
relations. 
  Referring to yesterday's meeting in Geneva, the government 
spokesman also said that Vance submitted ideas that Greece will 
study and reply to with relevant comments within 15 days. Asked 
if Vance's ideas include the proposal for the name, Venizelos 
said these ideas refer to all the topics. He added that Greece 
remains firm in its positions on the need to formulate the 
preliminary conditions for resuming the dialogue. 
  Referring to the resolution adopted by the European 
Parliament, Venizelos expressed the Greek Government's 
satisfaction and noted that, given the climate at the European 
Parliament, the resolution was the best possible. He also 
stressed the contribution of PASOK's [Panhellenic Socialist 
Movement] deputies who participate in the European Socialist 
Party, the draft from which formed the basis for the resolution.

  [Text] Responding to questions on the Skopje [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] issue, government 
spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that American and 
European efforts on the Skopje issue tend to be in the same 
direction on the matter of how they should formulate the 
preliminary conditions for dialogue between the two sides. He 
stressed that the coordinator of the efforts is Cyrus Vance. 
  The government spokesman also said that there is no 
possibility for a temporary lifting of the measures against 
Skopje and that Greece will lift the measures only when Skopje 
gives practical signs of goodwill, as demanded by the Greek 
side. A temporary suspension of the measures to allow a 
resumption of the dialogue is not in the government's plans, 
Venizelos said.

<F P=106> [From the "Our Views" column: "Embargo of Dependence"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Greek Government's measures against the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] have undoubtedly 
achieved a very important result in every way. The measures 
have deepened our country's dependence on the United States and 
European Union, something that today, one month after the 
measures were imposed, cannot be denied. What has followed the 
measures leaves no room for misinterpretation or different 
views. The Western allies who caused the problem with the 
barrage of recognitions of the neighboring republic have 
aggravated things anew by ignoring the positions of the Greek 
Government. They now come as mediators, brokers, and cool 
evaluators of the situation, with advice and threats, judgments, 
and criticism. [passage omitted] 
  The course of developments should change, even now. The 
measures against FYROM should be lifted and the stirring of 
nationalism and chauvinism should stop. If nothing else, when 
these feelings reach extremes, as in the case of the former 
Yugoslavia, they only bring war, hatred, and the bestiality of 
man. Direct dialogue with the neighboring state should begin 
now, away from the tentacles of the "protectors." Doesn't their 
involvement in the Cyprus issue over 40 years prove that they 
bring tragedy to a country?

  [Text] Turkey has said that the resolution adopted by the 
European Parliament in connection with lifting the immunity of 
certain deputies in Turkey is prejudiced and full of grave 
mistakes. 
  A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry says: The mere 
fact that the resolution was adopted without waiting for (Gali), 
cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary committee 
and member of the European Union, to return from Turkey is 
enough to show the extent to which the resolution is prejudiced. 
The fact that the resolution criticizes the Turkish Government 
shows how little those who drew up the resolution understand and 
respect the principles of a state of law: The decision to lift 
the immunity is a decision of the legislative body. The 
subsequent steps will be taken by the judiciary. The government 
has no authority to intervene in either of these stages. 
  The fact that the resolution talks about a Kurdish minority 
or autonomy is incompatible both with the realities in Turkey 
and with international law. 
  The resolution talks about lifting the immunity of eight 
Kurdish deputies, six of whom are DEP [Democracy Party] members. 
In other words, former Prosperity Party member Hasan Mezarci 
has also been placed in the same category. This basic material 
mistake can also give us an idea about the seriousness of the 
resolution. 
  A resolution that is full of such grave mistakes is bound to 
be just another European Parliament resolution.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still photographs of President </F>
Demirel and German Chancellor Kohl] 
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that even 
sympathizing with the separatist terrorist organization means 
indirect support. Therefore, he added, western countries must 
be careful about this point when they comment on lifting the 
immunity of certain deputies in Turkey. 
  Demirel received (Mark Gali), the European Union special 
envoy and cochairman of the Turkish-European joint parliamentary 
committee. A statement issued by the Presidential Press Office 
says Demirel recalled at the meeting that as recently as 1993 
the separatist terrorist organization killed 1,800 persons, of 
whom 1,100 were civilians. The president stressed that no state 
can allow the foundations of its constitutional order to be 
destroyed or its country to be divided. He pointed out that the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly resisted lifting immunities 
until very recently, but the attitude of some Democracy Party 
[DEP] deputies toward the recent incidents infuriated the 
public. That is why, Demirel said, the Assembly had to take 
certain measures to open the way for the independent judiciary 
in order to prevent certain deputies from using their 
legislative immunity as armor. 
  Demirel pointed out that the deputies in question have full 
means of defense under the guarantee of the Constitution, the 
protection of the law, and before independent judicial courts. 
Nobody should doubt the independence of the Turkish courts of 
justice, the president stressed. 
  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl telephoned President Demirel 
today, saying that the detention of some deputies has led to a 
negative campaign against Turkey in Europe. Kohl told Demirel 
that incorrect information and erroneous reports about the issue 
are circulating that are tarnishing Turkey's image. Kohl said 
he has absolutely no intention of interfering in Turkey's 
internal affairs, and he only wants to express certain ideas as 
a friend of Turkey and of the president. 
  During the telephone conversation, Demirel told Kohl that 
certain circles in Europe are trying to portray Turkey as 
unjustified in many cases where it is justified. Demirel 
pointed out that the DEP deputies and party leaders were acting 
as a branch of the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] terrorist 
organization. We have the documents to prove it, Demirel said, 
adding that he repeatedly asked the DEP deputies to openly 
denounce the terrorist acts perpetrated by the PKK. They always 
refrained from doing that, he added. 
  Demirel recalled the remarks by the DEP leader, who had said 
that the murder of five NCO cadets in Tuzla, Istanbul, by the 
PKK was a normal thing and part of a war. The president stated 
that these remarks infuriated the public, and the Assembly was 
forced to take the measure it took. He stressed that this 
measure is nothing but a step to open the way for the judiciary. 
He also said that the Constitutional Court will soon announce 
its ruling about the DEP application concerning the lifting of 
the deputies' immunity. 
  The president stressed during the conversation that nobody 
should doubt the independence of the judicial bodies in Turkey. 
The measures taken in Turkey so far, he said, are not and will 
not be any different from the measures taken or to be taken by 
any European country against terrorism and separatism.

[DEP] candidate for the Adana mayorship, were captured in 
Ankara. Among the captured is also the organization's 
responsible for the provinces of Ankara, Yozgat, Kirsehir, 
Konya, Kirikkale, and Kayseri. 
  It was determined that the persons, who were captured in 
operations conducted by teams belonging to the Ankara and 
Kirsehir Security Directorates, were preparing to perpetrate 
actions in Ankara, Kirikkale, and Kirsehir. Ensuing the 
suspects' interrogation, it was determined that they 
participated in the following acts: burning the forest opposite 
the Turkish Grand National Assembly lodges in Ankara and 
throwing bombs at the Nationalist Action Party provincial 
headquarters in Ankara and True Path Party District headquarters 
in Cankaya. It was also reported that the suspects perpetrated 
actions such as throwing bombs, attacking, and extorting money 
on behalf of the organization in Kirsehir, Diyarbakir, and 
Bingol. 
  In searches conducted of the safe houses and work places 
indicated by the suspects, two long-range automatic rifles, six 
magazines for these automatic weapons, 156 flares, three 
revolvers of various calibers and four magazines belonging to 
them, material used in the manufacture of bombs, and 
organizational documents were seized. 
  According to a statement issued by the Ankara Security 
Directorate, the head DEP official for Ankara Province is being 
sought. 
  Meanwhile the captured answered reporters' questions and 
stated that they were penitent, calling on everybody to resist 
violence. The suspects further explained that the terrorist 
organization is planning on transferring its violent 
perpetrations to metropolitan areas and for that reason they 
were also transferring their cadres to big cities.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 10 (A.A.) -- The Democracy Party (DEP) 
assembly said today that as they have withdrawn from the mayoral 
elections, they believe that, "those who have put their faith in 
our party will hopefully refrain from voting for the status quo 
parties and thus give them a lesson." 
  Assistant chairman of DEP, Kemal Bilget announced his 
party's 
assembly decisions in a press conference here today. 
  The statement said that DEP was ready to do whatever it 
could 
in accomplishing democracy, peace and brotherhood, despite the 
fact that the state has removed the immunity of six of their 
deputies. 
  "The party assembly, which has decided to take the necessary 
legal actions to celebrate Nevroz in some parts of the country, 
will spend all efforts to have the celebrations in a peaceful 
manner and free of bloodshed," the announcement said. 
  Bilget told journalists that his party was not, in fact, 
calling on the people to boycott the local polls. 
  "This is not a boycott but a wish" he said, adding that on 
March 27, he will stay in his home. 
  He added that his party was evaluating the option of 
celebrating Nevroz in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Izmit, Bursa, 
Mersin, Adana and Gaziantep, rather than the emergency rule 
regions. 
  He added that his party members will be in their electoral 
districts during Nevroz and large numbers of delegations from 
foreign countries will also go to the southeastern region during 
the Nevroz. 
  Meanwhile, the Anatolian News Agency learned that DEP 
members 
Remzi Kartal and Sedat Yurtdas flew to Brussels today to take 
part in a Kurdish conference.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 10 (A.A.) -- The four-way meeting 
between Turkey, France, Britain and the United States on the 
multinational force concluded here today. 
  A statement after the four-and-one-half-hour meeting said 
that the officials from the four countries reviewed the 
implementation of Operation Provide Comfort II and the situation 
in northern Iraq. 
  Representatives to the meeting were Deputy Foreign Minister 
Ozdem Sanberk, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European 
and Canadian Affairs Stephen Oxman, British Assistant 
Undersecretary for Middle East Affairs Michael Burton and French 
Foreign Minister for North Africa and Middle East Affairs Denis 
Bauchard. 
  "The sides expressed satisfaction with their ongoing 
cooperation, which deters the renewal of fighting and provides a 
framework in which humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people in the 
north can be met," the statement said. 
  The statement read by Sanberk called on the Iraqi Government 
to remove all the economic restrictions and embargoes it imposed 
on the northern Iraqi people. 
  "The participants reiterated their governments' commitment 
to 
the preservation of the independence, unity and territorial 
integrity of Iraq -- principles on which relevant UN Security 
Council resolutions are based, and which reflect the common 
stand of the international community," it said, also stressing 
that they "reaffirmed their determined opposition to all acts 
and efforts that may lead to the division and dismemberment of 
Iraq." 
  The parties in the meeting repeated their strong 
condemnation 
of terrorism and their "full support for Turkey's right of 
self-defense against the acts of violence of separatist terror 
organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]." 
  The statement added that the sides also emphasized that the 
territory of Iraq should not be a safe haven for the terrorists. 
  Concerning the economic losses Turkey suffered because of 
the 
embargo on Iraq, the statement said France, Great Britain and 
the United States reitrate their appreciation for Turkey's 
attitude during and in the aftermath of the Gulf crisis and 
recognized the continuing heavy economic burden on Turkey. 
  "They will consult further for ways and means for 
alleviating 
that burden," the statement said.

Guarantees Foreign Currency Accounts"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has denied the rumors 
that foreign currency deposit accounts will be converted into 
Turkish lira and that exchange bureaus will be closed. Ciller 
was shocked by reports published by Turkish newspapers yesterday 
that the deposit accounts will be converted into Turkish lira 
and that the exchange bureaus will be closed. She quickly 
called Yaman Turuner, the head of the central bank, and Aykon 
Dogan, minister of state responsible for economic affairs, from 
Istanbul to instruct them to make a detailed statement. 
  Ciller answered a HURRIYET correspondent's question in 
Eskisehir, saying: "That is out of the question. Who stands to 
gain from such rumors? Even the military regimes would not put 
that process into effect. I have already given an instruction 
for an official statement on the affair." 
  Later, Aykon Dogan issued a written statement. He said: 
"There is no need to intervene in foreign currency 
transactions. Foreign currency is not in short supply on the 
markets. No pending transfer in foreign currency exists in the 
central bank or the other commercial banks." 
  The central bank also issued a statement. It said: "Our 
people must ignore such rumors and maintain their deposits and 
investments in any way they wish without anxiety."

to preserve its power to block directives are met. 
  Speaker after speaker at the Strasbourg parliament stated 
during a debate on the enlargement talks that it would be 
impossible for the treaty to be ratified by the 518-member 
chamber if the British position were adopted. 
  There was support for Britain from only one MEP, a Spaniard. 
  The problem arises because of British fears that the 
admission of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden next year will 
dangerously dilute Britain's ability to block measures it 
disapproves of. 
  During two days of talks in Brussels this week, Mr Douglas 
Hurd, Foreign Secretary, told his European counterparts that 
Britain did not want the number of votes needed to block 
decisions increased when the Council of Ministers, the EC's 
decision-making body, gains in size. Britain now faces either a 
humiliating climb-down or the rancour it will cause by delaying 
the expansion of the EC. 
  Currently, two large countries and a small one can stall 
legislation by assembling a "blocking minority" of 23 votes out 
of a total of 76. Fifty-four votes out of a total of 76 are 
needed to approve an EC proposal in the present 12-member 
Council. 
  The number of votes are allocated to each country roughly 
according to population size, but small countries enjoy a 
disproportionate weighting. 
  Britain has 10 votes, or roughly one for each five million 
people; the new members will get a vote for roughly every three 
million. 
  Mr Hurd argues that, if the blocking minority is raised to 
27, it would be possible for countries with 41 percent of the 
EC's population to be outvoted. 
  Britain, with limited support from Spain, wants to keep the 
blocking minority at 23 after the enlargement. The remaining 
members, led by Belgium and the Netherlands, want it raised to 
27 to make it harder to veto majority decisions. 
  Herr Klaus Kinkel, the German Foreign Minister, opposed 
keeping the blocking minority at 23 for fear that the European 
Parliament would refuse to ratify the treaty. 
  "Britain has no chance of getting its position approved. It 
is a mystery why they have dug themselves into such a hole," a 
senior diplomat said. 
  Diplomats last night outlined a possible, though far from 
satisfactory, compromise, which would at least allow the 
enlargement procedure to go ahead. 
  It is a classic Euro-fudge. Under the compromise the 
blocking minority would be frozen at 23, in accordance with 
British wishes, pending the report of a high-level committee, to 
be established at June's EC summit in Corfu. 
  The committee would also prepare for institutional reform at 
an Inter-Govermental Conference in 1996. 
  The compromise would allow Britain to claim a degree of 
victory, although the row will merely be deferred for a year or 
so. 
  But it will be difficult to get through the European 
Parliament. There is also the strong possibilty that either the 
Belgian or Dutch parliaments would then reject the treaty. 
  The row, which is pitting Britain against its European 
partners to a degree rarely seen since the days of Mrs 
Thatcher's campaign for a budget rebate, will rumble on until 
ministers meet next Tuesday [15 March]. 
  That meeting will also attempt to resolve outstanding issues 
over Norway's membership.

<F P=106> [Article signed SM/NB: "Beginning of Talks on FYROM in </F>
Geneva"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Geneva, 10 Mar 94 -- Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in 
the dispute between Greece and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], met Thursday [10 March] at noon 
with the Greek Foreign Affairs Minister Karolos Papoulias. 
FYROM Foreign Affairs Minister Krste Crvenkovski, will meet 
with Mr. Vance in the afternoon. 
  The goal of the UN mediator is to renew the dialogue between 
Greece and FYROM which was cut off after Athens' decision to 
force a commercial blockade on FYROM. Just before the meeting 
with the Greek foreign affairs minister, Mr. Vance said he hoped 
to reach an agreement. 
  Greece decided on the blockade in order to defend itself 
from 
"the aggressive attitudes" of FYROM, Mr. Papoulias reminded the 
European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. The European 
Commission repeated that the Greek measures are in contradiction 
with the right of the European Union [EU], which is currently 
being presided by Greece. 
  On 16 February, Athens refused the transit of goods to FYROM 
from its harbor of Saloniki and closed its consulate in Skopje, 
capital of FYROM. In order to lift the blockade, Greece wants 
FYROM to renounce its name. It estimates that the name 
"Macedonia" implies territorial claims on a northern province in 
Greece which has been called Macedonia for centuries. 
  The United States declared to the government of Athens that 
they wish to see the economic embargo against FYROM lifted 
because it "does not contribute to stability" in the Balkans. 
Washington favors a renewal of the dialogue between Athens and 
Skopje under the protection of the United Nations. But 
Washington will not put forward "an American solution."

<F P=106> ["fk"-signed report: "The European Central Bank Will Not Be </F>
Simply Modelled on the German One"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Alexandre Lamfalussy firmly 
believes that European monetary union "will come sooner rather 
than later" and that it will be a union to promote stability. 
Addressing the German banking community, the president of the 
European Monetary Institute [EMI] made it clear that the 
European Central Bank (EZB) would not be modelled solely on the 
Bundesbank. 
  An extensive shift, a kind of "cultural revolution" geared 
toward price stability has taken place in Europe, explained the 
former general director of the Basel Bank for International 
Settlements (BIZ) in Frankfurt, addressing representatives of 
the German banking industry for the first time in his capacity 
as EWI president. It is no coincidence that inflation in a 
number of European countries has stood at below 3 percent for 
years and has even exhibited a downward trend in countries that 
have seen the value of their currencies fall. 
  According to Lamfalussy, Germany and the Bundesbank have 
earned the respect of their partners for the successful pursuit 
of a monetary policy geared toward price stability over a longer 
period of time. The decision to base the EMI and the future 
European Central Bank in Frankfurt is a tribute to that success. 
"However, it should come as no surprise to you that other 
European countries also have learned something that merits 
praise. A process of learning from one another" has commenced. 
  Lamfalussy recalled that the EMI's main task is to enhance 
the coordination of member-states' monetary policies while the 
responsibility for the formulation and implementation of 
monetary policies is still firmly in the hands of national 
central banks. He cannot share the view that this amounts to 
squaring a circle, because the Maastricht Treaty expressly 
describes "ensuring price stability" as the goal of coordination 
efforts. 
  Speaking about the preparations that the EMI has to make for 
the future European Central Bank, Lamfalussy focussed on the 
monetary supply target envisaged by the Bundesbank. The central 
banks could use goals of that kind to make themselves to a 
certain extent independent of political pressure and ensure that 
there is no relaxation of policy rigors. In any case, there has 
to be a sufficiently stable relationship between the money 
supply and prices, and this is something central banks are in a 
position to influence by means of medium-term money supply 
targets. 
  Germany and several other countries believe that both 
conditions "have been satisfied, not completely, but 
adequately," explained Lamfalussy. In the case of Great 
Britain, which is the most important example in Europe, at least 
one of these conditions is no longer relevant (the same applies 
to Canada and the United States). The EMI's chief's assessment 
of the present situation is "irrespective of what we agree on 
regarding a medium-term goal, the European Central Bank will in 
any event require a clear, operational medium-term goal, such as 
the level of short-term interest rates." 
  According to Lamfalussy, monetary union can be the result of 
a peaceful and gradual convergence process (with the EMI making 
its contribution in this respect) or possibly the result of a 
crisis (which the EMI could try to prevent). In any event, he 
believes that monetary union will occur "and sooner than 
sometime next century," because economic and financial markets 
"are forcing us to do so." 
  Lamfalussy warned that without a genuine monetary union, the 
reality of the European single market will be endangered by 
pronounced negative developments with regard to real exchange 
rates. The European Monetary System is a provisional solution, 
which can be torpedoed by pressure from speculation in a 
situation in which there is free movement of capital. It is 
"self-evident," said the EMI chief, that only those countries 
that have achieved a reasonable degree of convergence will 
maintain stable nominal exchange rates within the European Union.

<F P=106> [Philippe Escande report: "Difficult Birth of Environment </F>
Agency"] 
  [Text] Decided in 1989 and then officially created in 
1990, the European Environment Agency still does not have its 
own home. Tossed about by political battles which go way beyond 
it, so far this modest institution has not had much luck. For 
three years, France, although it initiated the project, blocked 
any decision on the Agency's headquarters while the future of 
the European Parliament in Strasbourg was threatened. The 
affair was settled last year and resulted in the selection of 
Copenhagen as the final headquarters. 
  This new Community body, modest in size, correspondently has 
an extremely ambitious objective: To finally give the European 
Union [EU] the means of pursuing a real environment policy. "In 
the absence of any reliable statistics, we cannot say anything 
about the state of the environment and respect for the 
directives in the different countries of the Union," Ioannis 
Paleokrassas, current commissioner for the environment in the 
European Commission, admitted. It is still impossible to 
compare the quantity of waste consumed, air pollution, or the 
quality of water between two Union countries. Indeed, Brussels' 
aim is to have a reliable and indisputable tool which enables it 
both to prepare future directives on the environment more 
efficiently and to monitor their effectiveness on the ground. 
<H5>  Independence but Modest Budget </H5>
  "The original idea was also to combat ecological 
inequalities 
by preventing the transfer of polluting activities to less 
demanding countries," Jacques Varet, director of research at the 
Environment Ministry and first chief of the French Environment 
Institute (IFEN), explained. The aim now is to gather, check, 
and process data coming from the whole European Union in order 
to make them available to Brussels, member states, and the 
public (associations or enterprises). 
  To carry out its task effectively, the Agency will have 
around 40 people and a budget of around ECU10 million (ECU9.5 
million this year, almost ECU13 million when fully operational). 
These are limited means which force it to work through a 
network. Correspondents in each country, called "focal points" 
in Community jargon, will have the task of collecting these 
data. In Germany, the focal point simply will be the big 
Federal Environment Agency, whereas France has set up a body 
especially devoted to this work -- the IFEN. It is for the 
European Agency to harmonize the methods and to compile and 
interpret the results. In addition, for specific requests, the 
Agency will use thematic centers (which may or may not be focal 
points) on specific subjects such as air, water, noise, waste, 
or land use. 
<H5>  Political Role </H5>
  At first, the Agency will mainly work on air and water 
quality, natural habitats, and waste. These priorities were all 
defined in the Fifth EU Framework Program. Every three years it 
will publish a report on the environment, a vast compendium 
including all the data harmonized at the European level. 
Meanwhile, it will design specific studies, for instance on 
acid rain, waste transportation, or the greenhouse effect. 
  The director of the Agency should be appointed in April. 
Then a work program covering several years will be drawn up 
before the summer. Officially, this institution will work 
completely independently. This is demonstrated by the fact that 
its 18-member Administrative Council will comprise in particular 
two Commission members, two members appointed by the European 
Parliament, one representative from each member state, a 
representative from Eurostat (the European statistical body), 
and a representative from the Joint Research Centers. This 
independence could ultimately engender tension. Although all 
states agree on the need to have a data collection tool, many 
are worried about seeing this institution transformed into a 
censor with the task of pointing out good and bad students 
(which are not necessarily those you would expect...) in the 
European Union in the sphere of the environment and the 
implementation of EU directives. 
  This is a "political" role which so far the Agency is being 
refused, but one which Brussels would like to see it playing. 
If it is simply a question of compiling and harmonizing 
statistics, was there any need to create a new body when a 
powerful tool in this sphere already exists with Eurostat? In 
addition, the web-like organization of the network, with focal 
points intersected by thematic centers, raises the fear of an 
escalation of bureaucracy, for which Brussels is already all too 
often criticized. 
  The Agency, because of this "headquarters battle," comes 
rather late, at a time when many of the European directives have 
already been adopted or are "in the pipeline" and especially at 
a time when the environment no longer has the same influence as 
before within the Commission and in the member states. It will 
therefore have to prove quickly that, despite its late arrival, 
it is still an observation post that is more vital than ever.

<F P=106> [Unattributed staff interview with Philippe Bourdeau, </F>
responsible for the European Environment Agency within the EU 
Commission; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [LES ECHOS] Why create a new Community institution 
devoted to the environment? 
  [Bourdeau] Hitherto, Community policy in the environmental 
sphere was limited to drawing up European directives and 
regulations. We did not have the means to monitor the effect of 
these directives on the environment. Hence the idea, launched 
by Jacques Delors in 1989, for a monitoring body capable of 
delivering objective, reliable, and comparable information on 
the state of the environment in Europe. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is this not redundant with the work Eurostat is 
carrying out already? 
  [Bourdeau] Eurostat is complementary, because it does not 
supply information on the state of the environment but economic 
data. These will be used by the Environment Agency in the 
framework of its work. For instance, in the case of a study on 
the influence of automobile traffic on air pollution or on the 
greenhouse effect, the Agency will compare its data on pollution 
with Eurostat's data on the automobile. 
  [LES ECHOS] Who will have access to the Agency's work? 
  [Bourdeau] The Commission, the member states, and the 
public, especially through the widest publication of a report on 
the state of the environment which will be updated every three 
years. But also through more specific studies, like studies on 
substances which affect the ozone layer, or on waste 
transportation. The choice of these special themes will be made 
in accordance with the preparation of European directives or at 
the request of the member states. But associations and 
enterprises will also be able to turn to the Agency to express 
their desire to have a particular subject studied. Although it 
is premature, it is not impossible to imagine that special 
studies may eventually be commissioned from the Agency. 
  [LES ECHOS] How long will it take before the Agency is fully 
operational? 
  [Bourdeau] The staff, 45 to 50 people, should be recruited 
by the end of 1995. Although things can be done before then, 
the Agency will not really be fully operational until mid-1995. 
At that time, new tasks might also be entrusted to it. For 
instance, the verification of the effective implementation of 
directives by the member states or the definition of 
environmental impact criteria for the establishment of ecolabels. 
  [LES ECHOS] Is the multiplication of national correspondents 
in "focal points" and in "thematic centers" not likely to make 
this institution difficult to manage? 
  [Bourdeau] Our aim is not to create new structures but to 
set up a network which is efficient. Our correspondents in each 
country will be the focal points. They may be big, as in 
Germany where the Federal Environment Agency will be our 
interlocutor, or smaller, as in France, with the French 
Environment Agency [IFEN]. But, for some specific tasks, the 
Agency will contract out work to specialized centers for limited 
periods and these will be much smaller in size. For instance, 
if we are carrying out a study on pollution in the 
Mediterranean, it is natural to try to use a specialized center 
chosen through a call for bids. The situation strikes me as 
perfectly manageable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "CORINE, the Agency's First Project"] </F>
  [Text] In 1985, the European Commission launched a pilot 
program christened CORINE which, translated from the Brussels 
jargon, means Coordination of Information on the Environment. 
Originally provisional, this project has become definite. 
Henceforth it will be taken over by the European Environment 
Agency because its mission foreshadows that of the new 
institution: To study the feasibility of an information system 
on the environment. The aim is to design a geographical 
database (maps), which would need to be comparable from one 
country to another, on various environmental issues. Six 
inventories are currently being drawn up or have been completed: 
on atmospheric emissions, water quality, biotopes, coastal 
erosion, soil erosion, and finally land use. This is a vital 
tool for carrying out thematic studies at European, national, or 
regional levels. 
  The land use program called "CORINE Land Cover" is being 
carried out under the leadership of the French Environment 
Institute (IFEN). It uses photographs transmitted by the 
(American) Landsat and (European) SPOT satellites, but also many 
aerial photographs, to draw up an accurate inventory (on a scale 
of 1:100,000) of the land used by towns, agriculture, forests, 
and other natural spaces. Compared in time (with old maps), 
these data make it possible to follow the progress of urban 
development, the erosion of natural areas, the development of 
pollution, and so forth, in 22 European countries. A valuable 
tool for planners, and especially for regions, but also for the 
allocation of EU [European Union] regional aid.

<F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Gonzalez Denies That Agreement </F>
With People's Party Should Be Simultaneous on All Institutions"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday 
rejected the possibility of using RTVE [Spanish Radio and 
Television Company] as a bargaining counter in the negotiations 
taking place with the People's Party on the so-called democratic 
impetus. Gonzalez thus denied that the government could accede 
to the People's Party's desire to renew the RTVE board of 
directors in return for the People's Party's allowing the 
filling of vacancies in the judiciary body -- the General 
Council of the Judiciary [CGPJ] -- and that of the ombudsman. 
  On the course of the above-mentioned negotiations, the prime 
minister said during his joint appearance with Argentine 
President Carlos Menem: "I am interested in an agreement, and 
since I am interested, I wish to create no declarative obstacle 
or obstructive declaration, so I will be cautious. I believe 
that the filling of posts in bodies such as the CGPJ or that of 
the ombudsman is not interchangeable with the discussion on how 
Spanish Television should operate. I am also prepared to change 
radically the RTVE charter, and for there to be a completely 
different board of directors. So I am completely open to 
negotiation, but it seems to me that the need to fill the 
vacancies in the judiciary bodies or that of the ombudsman 
cannot be lumped together with it." 
<H5>  New Executive Committee </H5>
  In government circles it is asserted that the government is 
prepared to accept that the RTVE parliamentary oversight 
committee must confirm the appointment of the public 
corporation's director general, who is appointed by the 
government itself. In addition, Gonzalez also gave a new clue 
to his ideas on the future PSOE leadership, in asserting that 
the current incompatibilities, which now limit -- and more so, 
if many of the amendments put forward for debate at the party 
congress succeed -- the prospects of, among others, the members 
of the government and regional leaders attaining the Executive 
Committee group, should be annulled. "I believe," he stated, 
"that the incompatibilities should be those laid down by the law 
on a general basis for all citizens, and, within the parties' 
functioning, the minimum ones in order to ensure that they are 
observed. Therefore, I would abolish even the incompatibility 
which exists right now between holding public office and the 
so-called area secretaries in the Executive Committee (or 
between a regional organizational post and a national 
organizational post)." 
  With respect to the existence or otherwise of profound 
differences between Guerraists and renewalists, with a view to 
the federal congress, Gonzalez denied "that there are major 
ideological differences. Ideologically distant stances are 
sometimes sought because there are personal disagreements, which 
are wrapped up with ideas." "But I believe," he added, "that 
there are no major ideological differences. There is a lively 
debate on some aspects which are very specific, such as the 
welfare state in a modern society or the role played by 
enterprises' competitiveness. I claim," he stated, "the right 
to be able to promote enterprises' competitiveness from a 
progressive stance, and for that to be introduced absolutely 
naturally and smoothly into social democratic language, since it 
must be modernized." 
  With respect to the High Court of Justice of Catalonia's 
ruling on the use of Catalan in education, the prime minister 
said that he respects it. "I believe," he added, "that it will 
pose no especially delicate problem, either of relations (with 
Convergence and Union) or, of course, of implementation. It is 
certainly a ruling which everybody will be prepared to 
implement."

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Engell, leader of the Conservative </F>
Party, by Karen Syberg; place and date not given: "Engell: `We 
Are Not Tiptoeing Anxiously Outside the Door'"] 
  [Excerpt] Hans Engell is proud of his success in keeping a 
steady course for the Conservative Party in a difficult year, 
but thinks that the party must be deserving of a return to power. 
  The administration has just celebrated its first 
anniversary, 
which of course means that the opposition also has a one-year 
anniversary. What does the leader of the Conservative Party, 
Hans Engell has to say about that? INFORMATION would like to 
know, which is why we visited the leader at his office at 
Christiansborg. 
  Christiansborg is mildly euphoric. It is seething with 
changes in the administration. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has just 
fired Major Bergstein, Arne Melchior, and Karen Jespersen, and 
Mimi Jacobsen has been appointed minister of coordination and 
industrial affairs and Bente Juncker minister of social affairs. 
  "Normally we do not comment on such ministerial 
reshuffling," 
Engell says on the phone, but nevertheless accepts the call from 
the journalist at the other end of the line. 
  According to Engell, the reshuffle is a helping hand for a 
troubled CD [Center Democrats] that thereby obtains "two weighty 
appointments." 
  "I know Bente Juncker to be a personally involved and 
dynamic 
politician," he says, moreover finding it remarkable that Nyrup 
changed ministers and their jurisdictions so close to a 
Folketing election. But it was probably the CD's weakened 
position that made it necessary. Karen Jespersen, who had not 
made any mistakes, was the person who had to withdraw, because, 
according to Engell, Bente Juncker's area was social policy, and 
should she become minister, it would have to be in this position. 
<H5>  Particular Mood </H5>
  Would Engell prefer to be a minister or to be in the 
opposition? 
  He seems to think that is has been difficult to be a 
minister 
at times, for instance when he was minister of justice in the 
summer of 1992 when the Tamil case "lay like a shadow over 
everything," and he had all together only five days off, which 
he spent on the phone. 
  The Palestinian problem? In this case people failed to 
realize that Engell as a minister was unable to do anything 
about the Refugee Council's rejection of the asylum application 
and that he had left an impression of trying to avoid the 
responsibility of being the appeal of last resort. What did he 
think about that? 
  "One grows to like it. If you find yourself in a besieged 
castle under constant fire, a special mood arises that has its 
own charm," says the former minister of defense, whose office is 
decorated with an impressive collection of coats of arms. "The 
problem was that I spent too much time solving problems and too 
little on conducting politics." 
  Of course he would prefer to be in the cabinet, he says, but 
"we do not tiptoe impatiently outside the door just waiting to 
take over. We have lived through a difficult year, during which 
we had to take responsibility for the Tamil case, regroup from 
being in a position of power to being in opposition, change our 
leader, and create an opposition policy. We have been able to do 
this without showing any signs of panic and without changing our 
policy, and I am satisfied with what we have done. 
  ``I have a feeling that we will be deserving of a return to 
power.'' 
<H5>  Considerable Modesty </H5>
  [Syberg] Will you admit to acknowledging that the 
Conservative Party was thoroughly compromised by the Tamil case? 
  [Engell] No, I will not say that. I will not say that the 
party has a collective responsibility, but we have received a 
psychological nosebleed and it is natural that we will need a 
time-out to consider. 
  [Syberg] Should there be a basis for a VK 
[Liberal/Conservative] government after the election, will there 
also be two candidates for prime minister? 
  [Engell] I feel very hesitant about discussing this topic. 
First, we have a prime minister; and secondly, we have said that 
the matter at heart is not a question of who. 
  [Syberg] Is that the same as saying that you know that the 
Liberals will insist on Uffe Ellemann? 
  [Engell] No, it is not the same. Who will become prime 
minister is a question of votes. The person who wins the 
majority of votes in the Folketing will become prime minister. 
  [Syberg] But something says that it is better to remain in 
the opposition for a while yet? 
  [Engell] No, I will not say that. There appears to be a rule 
of thumb that says that the longer one is in the opposition, the 
more difficult it is to escape the role of being in the 
opposition. 
  [Syberg] You make it sound like a law of nature? 
  [Engell] The more time that passes the more entrenched Nyrup 
will be in the prime minister's office. 
  [Syberg] But there must be something that the voters 
determine? 
  [Engell] Of course. But in summing up I will say that my 
intention is to return after the next election and to coordinate 
the party's regaining of power and strength. But there is time 
enough. 
<H5>  More Ideology </H5>
  The power and strength of the party is to be regained by 
creating a more ideological profile, Engell opines. 
  [Engell] I think that we, in the eyes of the voters, stand 
out like skilled craftsmen able to make agreements and that type 
of thing. This has cost us something because, strangely enough, 
we live in a time when ideologies apparently have gone bankrupt; 
in a very ideological time, when attitudes and values are in the 
seat of honor. And in those areas the profile we have kept is 
too low. 
  Schluter would not like to hear this, but we have probably 
neglected the ideological debate. 
  [Syberg] You appear to be the man in the Conservative wing. 
Are you? 
  [Engell] That is because the areas I have been responsible 
for are difficult areas like defense and the judicial system. 
If, instead, I had been minister of social affairs or culture, 
my profile would have been different. But as to attitudes, I 
really am a proper, traditional conservative, thinking for 
instance, that it should be made easier for the traditional 
family to survive, and working for a two-track school. 
  "But I do not think that it is the job of society or the 
party to determine how people should live," the leader stresses, 
advocating a [tolerance for] a broad variety of opinions, saying 
that he is happy that the Conservative Party is broad-minded 
enough to include a range of "members from a middle point of 
view to something that is on the edge of the Danish Society." 
  [Syberg] Are you happy that some of your members are at the 
edge of the Danish Society? 
  [Engell] No, no, that is not what I meant. It was the wide 
spectrum [of opinions] I was happy over! 
  [Syberg] Won't the Liberal Party's more ideological attitude 
be a problem in a coalition? 
  [Engell] No, it is good to have some ideological luggage. 
And 
when it comes to practical politics, in reality nobody lets 
himself be ruled by ideology. 
<H5>  Less Ideology </H5>
  [Syberg] Are you not in reality closer to a social democracy 
that carries out a middle-of-the-road policy: Is there any 
alternative to the welfare state? 
  [Engell] I prefer to call it a welfare society; but no, I do 
not think there is an alternative. I do not want a state with a 
minimum level of social welfare. The Conservative Party has had 
a considerable coresponsibility for the social development since 
the 1940's; we have voted for a majority of the most important 
new laws and one would be turning one's back on the entire 
development if one did not acknowledge this responsibility. 
However, we do think that the richest people should help the 
poorest; not that everybody should have a long list of similar 
social benefits. We want a better balance. 
  [Syberg] Why not implement this along with the Social 
Democratic Party that is working toward the same goals instead 
of with the Liberal Party which is working in the opposite 
direction? 
  [Engell] The Social Democratic Party is too much a part of 
the system we know today. It is the party with the least number 
of fresh ideas. They are too collectivistic in their way of 
thinking. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  The similarity between the "two old city parties" that 
Engell 
acknowledges to be there is to a large extent due to the fact 
that the political agenda has changed, so that there are more 
issues that the parties must agree on, he thinks. For instance, 
there is no party that does not demand a responsible 
environmental policy, nobody who does not think that the 
government's finances should be in order, etc. 
<H6>  * * * </H6>
  [Engell] Today we have more parties than unattached 
political 
points of view. 
  [Syberg] That raises the question of whether the party 
system 
has outlived itself. When everybody thinks the same, it does not 
matter who one votes for? 
  [Engell] No, that is not right, because there are always 
differences in attitude. Most new ideas come from the 
nonsocialist side. Both the Social Democratic Party and the 
Socialist People's Party stick with set ideologies. 
  [Syberg] When looking at your new party program "Freedom 
together," one is struck by one aspect. You always write that "a 
basic conservative attitude means so-and-so, 
but...then comes a bunch of qualifications?" 
  [Engell] The reason for that is exactly that we are not an 
ideological party. Conservatism is an expression of an attitude 
toward life, an inner compass, but beyond that we have made 
accommodations to social development. 
  [Syberg] You often ascribe to the basic conservative beliefs 
something which is impossible to disagree with, even for a 
non-Conservative, while what comes on the other side of the 
but might look like it cannot be carried out based on 
this basic belief. As an example you want a policy that promotes 
both the environment and growth. There are at least some who 
think that this is impossible? 
  [Engell] Not all economic growth needs to have environmental 
consequences. High technology and pharmaceutical products can 
easily be produced without harming the environment. 
  [Syberg] Is it right to say that you want to further some 
forms of growth and hinder others? 
  [Engell] No, definitely not. We think that there is a close 
relationship between growth and the environment. There is an 
incredible amount of hypocrisy in the environmental debate. For 
instance, look at the Soya cake. If we say that we do not want 
this kind of production in the middle of a big city or in this 
country, it will probably be moved to a place where the 
possibility of solving the problems is much poorer. This type of 
a problem must be solved using filters, safety precautions, etc. 
It is growth that will finance environmental policies. 
<H5>  Unworkable Program </H5>
  [Engell] A party program also has the attribute that some 
part of it is outdated as soon as it is in place -- while other 
parts will never get done. That is why I think that the process 
is just as important as the result. When working on this program 
many new members will be drawn into thinking and formulating 
political ideas. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Inger Jagerhorn report: "EU Stamp on Nordic Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The specter of the EU [European Union] hovered over 
the opening of the Nordic Council's meeting in Stockholm on 
Monday [7 March]. 
  The Nordic prime ministers all emphasized that the Nordic 
Council is now working under a new constellation of stars. It 
was almost as if it were possible to see the blue and gold 
banner of the EU fluttering alongside the eight Nordic flags in 
front of the Riksdag building. 
  According to Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the Nordic area will 
be a strong voice, but not a bloc in European cooperation. No 
Scandinavian politician was prepared to say on Monday precisely 
how this would be achieved, for the enlargement of the European 
Union to include three of the Nordic countries is still an open 
question. 
  On 1 March Sweden and Finland concluded their negotiations 
with the EU, whereas the Norwegian negotiations on fisheries 
became deadlocked. When the session began, Norwegian Prime 
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was absent. She was in Brussels 
with many members of her government in a final, all-out attempt 
to try and catch up, and bring the Norwegian negotiations to a 
successful conclusion before the end of the EU meeting, which 
ends on Tuesday. 
<H5>  Iceland Out in The Cold </H5>
  It fell to Prime Minister David Oddsson of Iceland -- the 
only Nordic country that is neither a member of the European 
Union nor an applicant for membership -- to deliver the five 
prime ministers' joint introductory address at the session's 
ceremonial opening in the Riksdag building. The presidency of 
the group of prime ministers rotates, depending on which Nordic 
country will host the next session. In 1995 it will be Iceland' 
s turn. 
  At a press conference the prime ministers developed their 
ideas about continued Nordic cooperation in a new and unfamiliar 
situation. Carl Bildt seized the opportunity to have a dig at 
those members of parliament who are worried that the prime 
ministers are assuming too much power: "We view the criticism 
as recognition of the fact that the prime ministers have 
accomplished something, and perhaps also as a relection of a 
fear that we have succeeded far too well. I think the members 
of parliament should regard it as a challenge for themselves." 
  Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, a long-standing member of 
the Nordic Council, went on to say that over the last 10 years 
the Council had failed to achieve anything new. 
  Bildt thought that time and time again Nordic studies had 
reached the conclusion that the necessary preconditions for 
making further progress in many areas do not exist. 
  Nonetheless, the prime ministers agreed that Nordic 
cooperation is now heading toward a brighter future within the 
framework of European integration. Bildt mentioned the fact 
that recently cooperation has been more intensive than anything 
he had experienced before. Aho thought he could see guarantees 
for the Nordic dimension also being able to function within the 
EU. And Denmark' s Poul Nyrup Rasmussen felt that Nordic 
parliamentarians have a future at European level. 
  Nyrup Rasmussen also consoled the Norwegians by saying that 
there is no such phrase as "the breakdown of negotiations," and 
that he is among those who believe that Spain should give way in 
the fisheries dispute. Esko Aho took the opportunity to point 
out that this proves it is possible for any member state to 
fight for its own national interests, despite its EU membership. 
  There will be referendums on EU membership in all three 
Nordic candidate countries, and Finland has indicated already an 
interest in 18 September, the same day as parliamentary 
elections in Sweden. 
  Carl Bildt reported on the Swedish situation following the 
chaotic meeting of party leaders on Friday: "There are two 
conceivable times -- mid-June or the end of November. A 
majority seem to be in favor of mid-June. However, that does 
not mean to say that it will be held in mid-June. At least two 
meetings of the party leaders still have to be held before the 
issue can be decided." 
<H5>  Domino Effect </H5>
  The Norwegian Government is counting on a domino effect, for 
Norwegian opinion polls show that the prospects for a "yes" will 
increase significantly if Finland and Sweden hold their 
referendums first. In response to a question as to when Norway 
would hold its referendum, the Norwegian minister of labor and 
municipal affairs, Gunnar Berge, answered cryptically: "Does 
the sun not move from east to west?" 
  When the 87 elected members of parliament from the five 
countries plus Aaland, Greenland, and the Faeroe Islands took 
their seats in the session chamber it was the second time that 
they tested a new arrangement that was introduced last year -- 
that is, that it is the prime ministers, rather than the 
ministers of Nordic cooperation, who outline their priorities 
and plans for Nordic cooperation. 
  Foreign policy, which used to be such a taboo subject at the 
sessions of the Nordic Council, now has its allotted place in 
the introduction to the prime ministers' opening address. The 
situation in the Baltic states, democratic developments and 
uncertainty in Russia, and the anxiety concerning the 
disintegration of Yugoslavia were central issues. The tone was 
more cautious on the subject of internal Nordic cooperation. 
<H5>  New TV Attempt </H5>
  David Oddsson raised the topic of TV cooperation, where -- 
after decades of failure -- attempts are now being made to open 
up the way for cross-border broadcasting, but where the problems 
of copyright still remain unresolved. He mentioned the plans 
for a Nordic environmental strategy for the years 1994-1996, and 
the data network that will now be linked up to all schools in 
the Nordic area with a view to improving language teaching. 
Preparations are also underway for a Scandinavian year against 
xenophobia. 
  "When one sees how comprehensive Nordic cooperation is, it 
is 
impossible not to wonder at how little the citizens of 
Scandinavia know about it," David Oddsson complained, adding: 
  "For a long time we have been talking about a single Nordic 
market. Thanks to the EEA [European Economic Area] agreement 
this has finally become a reality." 
  At the press conference, Carl Bildt said that in four or 
five 
years it will be time for a reassessment of the Nordic Council.

<F P=106> [Maria Romantschuk report: "EU Dominated Debate in Nordic </F>
Council"] 
  [Text] Stockholm -- As expected, the EU [European Union] 
ended up dominating the general debate at yesterday's session of 
the Nordic Council. 
  Advocates of the EU are convinced that cooperation within 
the 
EU will have a positive effect on Nordic cooperation, whereas 
Norwegian opponents, in particular, doubt this. 
  During the debate, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the 
leader of the Moderate Coalition Party, who seemed to be the 
person most enthusiastic about the results of the negotiations 
with the EU, cited Carl Jonas Love Almqvist and made a 
comparison with Robinson Crusoe's meeting with Friday. 
  "Regarding the platform that Almqvist sketched out, he says 
that it would be valuable to have a coin of the same value," 
quoted Bildt from the 1846 work of the writer, Almqvist. 
  "It was right then," he continued. "It has been right since 
then, and it continues to be right," he said, responding to a 
question raised by Norwegian Center Party leader Anne Enger 
Lahnstein, who may be said to symbolize EU opposition in Norway. 
  In her speech, she wondered how politicians who are in favor 
of the EU intend to get the people on their side and pointed to 
opinion polls showing that opposition to the EU has a firm base 
among the broad masses. 
  "When policies get really bad, then they hide behind opinion 
polls," remarked Bildt. 
  He praised the informal cooperation that also characterized 
Nordic cooperation and views the EU as a possibility. 
  "We are taking the step into the European, but this is 
providing us with opportunities to give Nordic cooperation a new 
lease of life. I am convinced that those who believe that 
cooperation will now be weakened do not understand what is 
happening. It is now that the Nordic area has its big chance." 
  When Enger Lahnstein said that she was worried about losing 
independence, Bildt made his comparison with Robinson Crusoe: 
"Robinson Crusoe was independent on his isolated island. He 
made all his decisions for himself until Friday appeared on the 
scene. When Friday arrived, Robinson Crusoe lost a little of his 
independence," Bildt admitted, but he went on to say that in 
today's world there was no room for a Robinson Crusoe policy on 
an isolated island. 
  Anneliese Dorum of the Norwegian Labor Party wondered 
whether 
conservative or social democratic policy will be pursued in the 
united Europe. In reply, Bildt could only say that it would be 
the voters who decided that. Norway's Kjellbjorg Lunde, from 
the Socialist Left Party, said that she believes that Bildt 
wants the help of the EU to scrap the Swedish welfare state. 
Prime Minister Bildt sees a no to the EU as a yes to isolation 
and views this as the worst alternative in every respect. 
  Social Democratic Party leader Ingvar Carlsson, the leader 
of 
the Swedish opposition, also spoke of the EU in glowing terms: 
"The Nordic area is being given a whole new platform to 
revitalize its own cooperation," said Carlsson, who does not 
believe that Nordic cooperation will be watered down within the 
EU. "Brotherly and sisterly feelings are not lessened by 
getting together with our cousins. If the political will is 
there, then I am convinced that, on the contrary, European 
cooperation will strengthen the family's togetherness." 
<H5>  Nothing About the Nordic Council in the EU Agreement </H5>
  Eduskunta deputy Mats Nyby of the SDP [Finnish Social 
Democratic Party] wondered why Nordic cooperation had not been 
written into the outcome of the negotiations with the EU that 
had been achieved the previous week in Brussels in the same way 
that it is written into the EEA [European Economic Area] 
agreement. He is worried that the omission of this clause from 
the EU agreement could hinder Nordic cooperation in the united 
Europe. Nyby suspects that Council cooperation was deliberately 
left out of the agreement. 
  Meanwhile, Eduskunta deputy Claes Andersson of the Left-Wing 
Alliance wondered why the EEA administration is already being 
dismantled before the referendums have been held in the 
respective candidate member states. In his opinion this 
demonstrates a contempt for democracy and the will of the people. 
  Ole Norrback, the minister for Nordic cooperation, made it 
clear that membership in the EU did not mean that there would 
necessarily be any haggling over Nordic cooperation. On the 
contrary, such cooperation is a more active period. 
  "Nordic cooperation can certainly function best if all the 
Nordic countries have the same relationship to the EU, but no 
country can be left out of Nordic cooperation, regardless of 
what happens with the membership of the remaining countries." 
  Eduskunta deputy Erkki Tuomioja (SDP) said that the Nordic 
Council must not become an oversight body for Nordic European 
policy. 
<H5>  A European Line Vis-a-Vis Russia </H5>
  During yesterday's session, Prime Minister Esko Aho 
reiterated his conviction that the EU simply presents Nordic 
cooperation with a challenge. In his speech, he also touched on 
the line to be taken toward Russia. 
  "As far as Russia is concerned, there is only one European 
line, which the Nordic area should also support and actively 
promote. We must avoid isolating Russia or allowing Russia to 
isolate itself from the European community or from Nordic 
cooperation." 
  Hjorleifur Guttormsson of Iceland's People's Alliance 
wondered why in his speech Aho did not go into the EU's foreign 
and security policy, which Finland as an EU member state must 
embrace. 
  Aho stated that Finland has said that it is ready to 
participate in that process "if we are members of the EU when it 
happens." However, he said that in the future too the guiding 
principle in Finland's foreign and security policy will continue 
to be military nonalignment and an independent defense force. 
  Also Finnish Social Democratic Party leader Paavo Lipponen 
believed that it was important for Finland to be involved in 
shaping the EU's foreign and defense policy. 
  Lipponen also promised that the Social Democrats in Finland 
will make a constructive contribution to resolving any 
outstanding questions concerning Finland's national subsidies 
for farmers "after the government had examined the matter and 
reached a decision on its proposals." 
  The Center Party's Timo Jarvilahti outlined Finland's 
farmers' need for additional support, "so that it will be 
profitable to cultivate crops throughout the whole country."

<F P=106> [Report signed M.d.M.: "The EU Committe of Regions Is Born </F>
-- Institution Presidency Slips Through Luc Van den Brande's 
Hands"] 
  [Text] It was amid much disorder, but the makings of a 
historic moment was there, when the EU [Europoean Union] 
Committee of the Regions was inaugurated last Wednesday [9 
March] and Thursday. The meeting of the 189 representatives of 
regional and local government resulted in the appointment of a 
president for the institution. Of the four candidates, the 
Frenchman Jacques Blanc, president of Langedoc-Roussillon, was 
eventually elected. His appointment is the result of lobbying 
among his colleagues as well as the outcome of agreements with 
other candidates. Luc Van den Brande from Flanders, the main 
outsider was felt to be too supportive of the North, but above 
all handicapped by the separatist and radical image of a certain 
element of Flanders. 
  Mr. Blanc will remain president for two years. He will then 
switch places with Catalan Deputy President Pasquall Maragall. 
The secretary general will probably be a German. Pause from 
Bavaria is the most likely candidate. 
  Despite the celebrations, the Committee members did not 
forget that they are on probation until 1996, when the Committee 
statute may be modified. Some members, like Bavarian President 
Edmund Stoiber, intend to turn the Committee into a Third 
Legislative Chamber, alongside the Council of Ministers and the 
Parliament. 
  To deserve this promotion, the Committe will have to prove 
that it means business. It will be consulted on numerous 
matters, such as the European transport and telecommunication 
networks, economic and social cohesion, structural funds, etc. 
With its first recommendation being sought by 9 April, the 
Committee will hold its next session in Brussels on 4-5 April. 
Jacques Blanc indicated that it will have to focus on clear 
objectives and avoid going in too many directions.

  [Text] Geneva, 10 Mar (ATS) -- Cyrus Vance, UN mediator in 
the dispute between Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM], had a long meeting in Geneva on Thursday [10 
March] with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. "There is 
room for a solution but obstacles remain," Mr. Vance said after 
the meeting in which he handed Mr. Papoulias a "document," the 
contents of which he did not reveal. 
  The Greek minister welcomed the "excellent climate" which 
prevailed during this meeting. A second meeting will probably 
be held in "the near future," Mr. Vance said. Meanwhile, "our 
representatives will meet to continue the search for a means of 
breaking the deadlock," Mr. Papoulias explained. 
  The question of the blockade imposed by Greece on FYROM must 
be "discussed." "I do not think that this blockade will be 
lifted soon," Mr. Papoulias stressed. The lifting of the 
blockade will have to "form part of an overall solution to the 
problem" of FYROM, the Greek minister said. 
  Following his first meeting with the UN mediator, Mr. 
Papoulias left Geneva for Belgrade, according to his spokesman. 
No meeting therefore will be held in Geneva, as had been 
rumored, between the Greek minister and FYROM Foreign Minister 
Stevo Crvenkovski, who meanwhile had arrived in the lakeside 
city. 
<H5>  Damaging Effects </H5>
  Mr. Crvenkovski had a meeting with Mr. Vance late in the 
afternoon. The FYROM minister stressed the "illegal" nature of 
the blockade whose effects are "enormously" damaging for the 
FYROM economy. 
  Mr. Papoulias reaffirmed to the European Parliament in 
Strasbourg on Wednesday that Athens had decided on an economic 
blockade to defend itself from FYROM's "aggressive attitudes." 
Since 16 February, the passage of goods for FYROM through the 
Greek port of Salonika has been banned. In addition, the Greek 
Consulate in Skopje, capital of the FYROM, has been closed. 
  Greece is demanding that the Skopje government abandon its 
flag, which shows the Vergina sun (symbol of the late Macedonian 
dynasty), and the name "Macedonia." This name, Athens points 
out in substance, implies territorial claims on the northern 
province of Greece which has been called "Macedonia" for 
centuries.

<F P=106> [Article signed GGD/RHR: "Bulgaria and Partnership for </F>
Peace: Financial Problems"; as released by Brussels BELGA 
Database] 
  [Text] Brussels, 11 Mar (BELGA) -- Bulgaria, which signed 
the Partnership for Peace [PFP] last month, may lack the 
resources to fully participate in the joint activities planned 
with NATO due to financial problems, reports the Bulgarian Army 
chief of staff. 
  General Lyuben Petrov ended a five-day visit to Belgium on 
Friday [11 March], during which he noted the similarities 
between army reforms in Belgium and Bulgaria, he told BELGA on 
Thursday. His talks with his Belgian counterpart, Lieutenant 
General Jose Charlier, focused in particular on the Partnership 
for Peace proposal made by NATO to its former enemies in East 
Europe. 
  General Petrov believes that the lack of financial resources 
could, however, prevent his country from being a "major partner" 
in multilateral cooperation activities with NATO. Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev came to Brussels on 14 February to sign 
the Partnership for Peace document proposed by the Atlantic 
alliance to former Warsaw Pact countries. 
  "We may not be greatly involved," said General Petrov on 
Thursday, in reply to a question which raised the fact that most 
of the costs of the Partnership will be borne by East European 
countries. 
  He believes the Bulgarian Army welcomes this proposal which 
includes possible joint participation in peacekeeping 
activities. He pointed out that for the first time Sofia had 
sent a contingent of blue helmets to Cambodia. But they 
encountered "difficulties" when they arrived due to their lack 
of preparation. 
  The Bulgarian chief of staff believes each participating 
country is free to choose the Partnership activities. "We are 
in the process of preparing a national program, which the 
government and Parliament must then approve," he stated. 
  He is also pleased with the quality of the bilateral 
military 
cooperation which has existed between Belgium and Bulgaria over 
the last two years, "the best" of any Western countries which 
maintain military contacts with Sofia, and which has produced 
"substantial exchange programs," in the words of General 
Charlier. 
  The Belgian chief of staff observed that the first joint 
military exercises planned by the Partnership would probably not 
be able to start immediately. "We must first set up the 
necessary structures, receive the political directives, and draw 
up procedures," he stated. 
  During his visit to Belgium, General Petrov met with Belgian 
Defense Minister Leo Delcroix. He also visited SHAPE [Supreme 
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe], the Florennes air base, the 
7th Armored Infantry Brigade at Marche-en-Famenne and the 
National Geographical Institute.

Highlighted by Bouvard"] 
  [Text] Tirana, 11 Mar (ANSA) -- Louis Bouvard, chairman of 
the North Atlantic Assembly -- the forum of NATO and ex-Warsaw 
Pact nations -- today told Albanian Defence Minister Safet 
Zhulali that Albania is a "true partner" of NATO and that there 
will be no lasting peace in the Balkans without the 
participation of Albania. 
  Bouvard stressed that Albania's associate membership in the 
North Atlantic Assembly was an important step in its integration 
with NATO. Zhulali described Bouvard's speech to the Albanian 
parliament as "the warmest ever" by a foreign political figure. 
  Zhulali asked for greater support to counteract the effects 
of the embargo on former Yugoslavia, and expressed the view that 
there will be no "definitive end" to the Balkan crisis without a 
solution to the Kosovo, the largely ethnic-Albanian enclave 
within Serbia.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN Under Secretary Kofi Annan from Ghana by </F>
Guido Santevecchi in Rome; date not given: "The `Folgore' May 
Be Called Upon To Intervene in Bosnian Chaos"] 
  [Text] Rome -- A tough, frustrating and painful mission has 
just come to an end in Somalia, and there is already talk of 
committing Italian troops in another nightmarish war scenario, 
namely, Bosnia. The United Nations is looking frantically for a 
further 10,000 blue berets to be deployed within the next few 
days in order to preserve the fragile cease-fire. Until now, 
nobody had requested Italian troops, given the rule which 
prohibits the United Nations from making use of military 
personnel from bordering countries or countries involved in 
previous conflicts (such as World War II), but in the face of 
desperate need, the British suggested a departure from that 
rule. The UN undersecretary for peace missions arrived 
yesterday in Rome. 
  [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, are you here to take up the offer 
of 
1,700 soldiers which the government made in 1992? 
  [Annan] The policy of ruling out bordering countries has not 
been changed yet. I have no requests to make, I am not here to 
negotiate, but to take part in a convention on UN reforming. 
True, the countries already involved in operations in the 
former Yugoslavia are saying that they already have done enough. 
Unless we find another solution fairly quickly, in the end we 
may have to drop that rule which so far has excluded Italy, 
Austria, and Turkey. This possibility is being discussed in New 
York. 
  [Santevecchi] It has also been suggested that Italians could 
be sent to take over from other forces in hot spots that are not 
affected by the prohibition? 
  [Annan] This would make no sense. Reinforcements are needed 
in Bosnia as soon as possible. Consider, for example, replacing 
forces deployed in Cyprus, Somalia, or Mozambique, with Italian 
troops. It would take too long and, besides, you cannot change 
a unit's operational area from one day to the next. At the 
most, we could send replacements to Croatia in order to be able 
to transfer units which are already incorporated in UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] from Croatia to Bosnia. [Annan ends] 
  It sounded somewhat strange to discuss the possible 
deployment of Italian troops under the UN flag with a man who 
was one of the protagonists of last summer's "hot days," when he 
asked for, and obtained, the sacking of General Bruno Loi, who 
was guilty of having predicted, and stated, that by following a 
hard line and giving [Somali General] Aidid no quarter, 
Mogadishu would become an uncontrollable battlefield. This, of 
course, is exactly what happened. Moreover, today Kofi Ann will 
be sitting beside the "rebel" officer, since they will both be 
speaking at the meeting organized in Rome by the Disarmament 
Archive. 
  [Santevecchi] Mr. Under Secretary, only yesterday Robert 
Oakley, former U.S. envoy to Mogadishu, admitted that "Italy, 
with its profound knowledge of Somalia, had understood the 
dangers involved in the operation much earlier than the 
Americans, who unfortunately only realized this too late." 
Oakley also asserted that the United Nations proved to be 
incapable of coordinating its efforts with the countries already 
involved in field operations. 
  [Annan] (The Ghanaian diplomat nodded affirmatively, and 
then 
replied with frankness about the summer crisis between the 
United Nations and Italy and the brutality) No doubt some 
mistakes were made. Attention has focused too much on Aidid's 
personality, and on North Mogadishu. The fact that in the rest 
of Somalia the operation was largely successful, and that nobody 
is dying of starvation any longer down there, has not been 
sufficiently highlighted. But I think the main mistake, on the 
part of governments and public opinion alike, was expecting a 
rapid solution with no risks involved. In this sense, the 
problems we faced in Somalia have helped us clarify our ideas as 
regards future peacekeeping operations. As far as Loi is 
concerned, his fault lay in voicing his disagreement publicly. 
This is not allowed when you are part of an international 
force. (So, then, Annan and Loi are still "enemies.") 
  [Santevecchi] Anarchy and partisan warfare will be resumed 
on 
a large scale. This is what most experts expect following 
Western disengagement. 
  [Annan] Let me say that in all situations of this kind, the 
decisive thrust toward peace can only come from the local people 
and their leaders. The international community can only help. 
Discussions and negotiations are currently under way in Somalia 
among the various chiefs, including Aidid. I believe they now 
understand they cannot afford to miss this opportunity. I do 
not believe that the 20,000 blue berets that will remain there 
(Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese, Zimbabweans) will be subjected 
to systematic attacks. I do not rule out the possibility of 
skirmishes, banditry, but you will see, the situation will not 
return to what it was before the intervention. 
  [Santevecchi] You seem to be engaged in a permanent quest 
for 
men and resources, a sort of door-to-door begging to obtain a 
few hundred blue berets. How can this be changed? 
  [Annan] Currently we are engaged in negotiations with more 
than 50 states with a view to reaching permanent agreements. We 
want to know what resources these countries are ready to commit 
to the United Nations -- combat units, logistic support, medical 
units -- including the timescales and terms of this commitment. 
Then we will know what forces we can rely on. 
  [Santevecchi] Mr. Annan, let us imagine that the "Folgore" 
[Division] arrives in the former Yugoslavia. What would you 
think if General Loi joined them, perhaps in command of the 
troops? 
  [Annan] (Laughed, then was serious again) It is not UN 
policy 
to suggest to any country who should command their troops. That 
is all.

<F P=106> [Julie Wolf report: "Brittan Veers From UK Line on Union"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union 
[EU] trade commissioner, has distanced himself from the British 
Government line by pressing for trade union rights to be 
contained in future international trade agreements. 
  The stance will be taken by some European politicians as a 
sign that the former Conservative cabinet minister wants to 
underline his independence from Britain as part of his campaign 
to succeed Jacques Delors as European Commission president. 
  A strategy paper drawn up by Sir Leon says the EU should 
"make clear its willingness to include the trade-related aspects 
of human and social rights" in the World Trade Organisation 
being set up under the GATT Uruguay Round. The paper, which is 
to be put to the full European Commission for adoption in coming 
weeks, specifically lists trade union rights, forced labour and 
prison Iabour as subjects to be pursued by the EU. "The 
institutions of the EU must enunciate more clearly the social 
commitment entrenched in the Maastricht Treaty, and must explain 
more clearly to the citizens of Europe how in the past these 
principles have already been carried into practice as well as 
what more can be done," Sir Leon's paper says. 
  Incorporating labour issues into the world organisation 
could 
open the way for the withdrawal of trade advantages to 
developing countries that fail to respect internationally agreed 
rights. The commissioner's position runs counter to the British 
Government's contention that there is no place for social issues 
in world trade negotiations. British officials believe there 
could be a dangerous impact on trade if the organisation is 
given the mandate to deal with social issues. 
  The Government could be embarrassed by Sir Leon's call for a 
strengthening of the International Labour Organisation [ILO] 
including the possible imposition of sanctions against countries 
that fail to live up to ILO conventions. Britain has faced 
repeated criticism from the ILO, in particular for its trade 
union ban at GCHQ [Government Communications Headquarters]. 
  Sir Leon's stance also marks a shift from his initial 
hostility to recent suggestions from the Clinton Administration 
that labour issues be brought into the world trade arena after 
next month's signing of the GATT deal in Marrakesh. 
  Washington argues that developing countries should not be 
able to gain competitive advantage on world markets because of 
poor working conditions. 
  The paper puts Sir Leon closer to the views of Europe's 
Christian Democratic parties, which strongly support efforts to 
improve working conditions in Europe and elsewhere in the world. 
Unlike the Tories, the Christian Democrats are closely linked 
to trade union movements. 
  Sir Leon's initiative is likely to be broadly welcomed by 
the 
European and international trade union movements, which have 
been pressing for some time for a social clause in GATT.

Kurdish Parliamentarians Detained in Turkey"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Strasbourg, 10 Mar (BELGA) -- The European 
Parliament (EP) denounced Thursday [10 March] the arrest of 
Kurdish Parliamentarians in Turkey and asked that they be 
released immediately. 
  On 2 March, the Turkish Parliament decided to waive the 
parliamentary immunity of eight Kurdish deputies, six of whom 
belong to the Party of Democracy (DEP). Most of these deputies 
subsequently were arrested. 
  Belgian socialist deputy Marc Galle (of the Flemish 
Socialist 
Party) made an emergency trip to Turkey on 7 March in his 
capacity as chairman of the interparliamentary delegation for 
Turkey, it was learned on Thursday. Mr. Galle has the task of 
collecting information in Ankara from the Turkish president and 
Government. He must make his report next week in Brussels 
before the EP's Committee on Foreign Affairs and Security. 
  In its resolution, the Parliament denounces the "Turkish 
Government's attack on pluralist democracy" and says that the 
"only crime" of those arrested was "defending the interests of 
the Kurdish people in Turkey who are the victims of a bloody 
military repression." 
  The policy of repression and the ban on elected 
representatives expressing themselves freely "could only 
encourage the members of the Turkish minority to support the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]." The EP concluded by asking the 
Turkish Government "to finally recognize the right to autonomy 
of the Kurdish people in Turkey."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "East Europe -- Parliament Approves </F>
EU Contribution to EBRD's "`Nuclear Safety' Account"; as 
released by Brussels Textline database] 
  [Text] Reinforcing nuclear safety in the countries of East 
Europe is a matter of great importance to the European 
Parliament [EP], which has followed its rapporteur Mr. Adam 
(Soc, UK) and approved the Council's proposal of contributing 20 
million Ecus to the "nuclear safety" account set up with the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In his 
report, Mr. Adam states that the first operations done in this 
area by the EBRD in Bulgaria and Lithuania seem to meet EP 
criteria. The next operations in Russia are a test of the 
EBRD's strategy and are therefore to be closely monitored by the 
Community institutions. The sums in question were included in 
the 1993 budget but were not committed because there was no 
legal base. They are included in the 1994 budget as a token 
entry, and if the 1993 appropriations are to be used this year, 
a decision will have to be made before the end of March. 
  The EP wants the operations in question to be included in a 
strategic and safety action plan negotiated with the beneficiary 
countries (which should respect the main international 
agreements of security) and the interested countries to be 
endowed with an independent body responsible for safety. It 
also called for the early closure of the plants the least safe. 
During the debate, Mr. Bettini (Greens, It) criticized the 
report, calling for large-scale reconversion to "clean" energy, 
as Mr. Shevardnadze himself had proposed for all of Georgia's 
energy.

<F P=106> [James Blitz article: "Clarke Pledges Relentless Pressure on </F>
Spending"] 
  [Text] Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday 
rejected criticism from rightwing Tory backbenchers that he had 
been too cautious in cutting public expenditure. 
  He said spending restraint was a "relentless task" which 
would be central to all Conservative Budgets. 
  In an unusually tough speech Mr Clarke gave his first clear 
backing to the fundamental reviews of departmental expenditure 
being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the 
Treasury. 
  Mr Clarke underlined the importance of the reviews by saying 
that they were not a one-off attempt to reduce a big budget 
deficit. 
  He said the whole basis of departmental spending -- 
including 
the issue of whether the state should withdraw from certain 
activities -- should be regularly scrutinised in the approach to 
the annual Budget. 
  He told industrialists at a conference in Westminster: 
"Bearing down on public spending is a relentless task. My 
strong view -- and that of Michael Portillo -- is that 
controlling public spending is definitely not something 
chancellors and chief secretaries only do once in a while." 
  In recent months some Tory backbenchers, including Mr Norman 
Lamont, the former chancellor, have warned that tough spending 
cuts recommended in some of Mr Portillo's early reviews were not 
fully implemented in the last Budget. 
  They have said that cost-cutting measures announced by Mr 
Clarke last November in areas such as social security and 
education -- were already in the pipeline, and that Mr Clarke 
could have been even more stringent. 
  The chancellor emphasised yesterday, however, that he had 
reduced spending plans by 15 billion pounds more than had been 
envisaged in the March 1993 Budget -- "more than anyone thought 
possible." 
  He said that the first four expenditure reviews -- in 
health, 
Home Office, education and social security -- had "contributed 
to the success of last November's spending round." 
  Treasury officials privately emphasised yesterday that two 
cost-cutting reforms announced in the November Budget -- the 
introduction of the job seekers' allowance and of incapacity 
benefit -- were direct results of Mr Portillo's review of social 
security. One official said: "That was what the review was 
after and that was what we delivered." 
  Mr Clarke stressed that cuts in taxation before the next 
election would be possible only against a background of spending 
restraint. 
  "Whenever I am asked `Will taxes ever come down?' I say: 
`Yes, provided we control public spending,'" he said. "As a 
Conservative chancellor, I will always look first to the 
spending side of the account when deciding how to reduce the 
deficit."

<F P=106> [Larry Elliott article: "CBI Attack on Unequal Britain"] </F>
  [Text] Howard Davies the director-general of the 
Confederation of British Industry [CBI], called on the 
Government and employers last night to face up to the 
consequences of deep-seated economic changes that had 
transformed Britain into a more unequal and poverty-stricken 
society. 
  In a hard-hitting lecture to Manchester Business School, Mr 
Davies said the dramatic upheaval over the past decade required 
better training, a radical shake-up of the tax and benefits 
system and policies to help the long-term unemployed back into 
work. 
  The leader of the employers' organisation distanced himself 
from the laissez-faire approach followed in the 1980's and urged 
action to cope with the sharp increase in joblessness among 
unskilled men. 
  He said the widening gulf between rich and poor had not been 
matched by a universal increase in living standards. Over the 
past 10 years "the poorest 10 percent and some others have 
become absolutely poorer." The Government has always argued 
that all income groups have become better off in the past 15 
years. 
  Mr Davies said the 1.3 million increase in jobs during the 
1980's was entirely accounted for by part-timers, mostly women. 
  Mr Davies canvassed the idea of a negative income tax, which 
would top up the pay of those on low wages and thereby drag them 
out of the poverty trap. 
  Despite giving guarded support to the Chancellor's attack on 
excessive boardroom payouts, Mr Davies concentrated on the 
changes lower down the income scale. "It is clear that, for a 
combination of reasons not by any means all under our control, 
British society is becoming more unequal," he said. 
  The CBI chief said society was being transformed in four 
distinct ways -- a greater prevalence of divorce, increased 
participation in the workforce of part-time women from generally 
better-off households, widening income distribution and higher 
poverty. "These four changes have occurred quite rapidly and 
the cumulative effect of them is enormous." 
  As a result, Mr Davies said Government and industry needed 
to 
rethink their attitudes to training, child care, benefits and 
working practices. "We must try to upskill workers displaced 
from traditional industries. And we start from a long way back, 
with a workforce which is endowed, on average, with 
significantly lower skills than our competitors." 
  In his 18 months at the CBI Mr Davies has been no stranger 
to 
controversy, causing a flurry in government circles last autumn 
when he warned that business was unhappy about the anti-Brussels 
rhetoric from ministers at the Conservative party conference. 
  The CBI chief said he was pleased that the paper prepared by 
the Treasury and the Department of Employment for next week's 
Jobs Summit in Detroit had stressed the need for a close look at 
ways of using the tax and benefits system to improve incentives 
to work. 
  "But what will the `close look' signalled by this paper 
produce? Are we ready to accept that the tax and benefit system 
should be integrated more closely, with concepts such as 
negative income tax? Or is that too much like socialism?" 
  Mr Davies defended management from blanket attacks on their 
pay increases, saying there was little evidence that overall 
there was "one law for the rich and one for the poor." 
  But he added: "It is -- sometimes -- difficult to understand 
the rationale for packages which include high basic pay, large 
bonuses and big tranches of options, all at the same time. And 
when I say it is difficult, what I mean is, it is too difficult 
for me and I am not even going to try." 
  He added that income inequality was greater in some of the 
world's most dynamic economies such as the U.S. Many people 
would accept greater inequality if the concomitant was a dynamic 
economy in which everyone's living standards rose. "But in the 
last decade that is not the way it has been." 
  Mr Davies said that during the 1980's the average income of 
the top tenth of earners rose by 62 percent, the bottom 10 
percent saw a fall of 14 percent. The numbers on income support 
had risen from 3 million to 4 million. "The new poor are 
heavily concentrated among one-parent families and the long-term 
unemployed."

<F P=106> [Bronwen Maddox article: "Half of Country `Is Damaged by </F>
Acid Rain'"] 
  [Text] Buildings and wildlife in half of the UK are being 
damaged by acid rain, says a government report published 
yesterday. 
  Scientists say the contraction of the coal industry will cut 
the area affected by nearly nine-tenths early next century. 
  The estimates, prepared for the Department of the 
Environment, show that western and northern parts of the UK, 
including much of Wales and Scotland, are particularly affected. 
  Mr. Robert Wilson, chairman of the report's research group, 
said the soils and rocks of these areas contained little 
alkaline material to counteract the acid. 
  Last week in Geneva the UK agreed the terms of a UN protocol 
to curb the sulphur dioxide emissions which help cause acid rain 
and come largely from coal-burning power stations. Under the 
agreement, likely to be signed later this year, the UK must cut 
emissions to 50 percent of 1980 levels by the year 2000, and to 
30 percent by 2005 and 20 percent by 2010. 
  Ministers have been assured that the power generation 
industry's switch from coal to gas means that the UK can meet 
the new obligations. 
  Environmentalists such as the pressure group Friends of the 
Earth have criticised the UK for refusing to sign an earlier 
sulphur protocol which expired last year. 
  The report employs the "critical loads approach" that the UK 
has urged international conventions to follow. This takes 
account of the environment's sensitivity as well as the extent 
of pollution when assessing the impact of acid rain. 
  The report says that some damage to Scottish heather and to 
salmon and trout stocks in Wales can be attributed directly to 
acid rain. However, it adds: "It is harder to link damage to 
tree health directly to air pollution -- the causes are complex." 
  About 10 percent of pollution recorded by the study was 
found 
to come from other countries. 
  Even if sulphur emissions were curbed sharply some areas, 
such as the southern Pennines, "would never recover from layers 
of deposits since the Industrial Revolution," the report says. 
  Negotiations on a protocol to curb nitrogen oxides, which 
are 
emitted from vehicles and other sources, are expected to take 
several years.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [10 March], Defense 
Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], 
met Lithuanian Foreign Minister Povilas Gylys for an exchange of 
opinions. The Defense Ministry has stated that the two 
ministers discussed the situation in the Baltic republics and 
the CIS. In addition, they also broached issues of European 
security architecture and bilateral cooperation. They also 
talked at great length about details of NATO's Partnership for 
Peace offer to the countries of East Europe. 
  Gylys had met Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free 
Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], on Wednesday. That meeting 
was also attended by Estonian Minister Without Portfolio Juri 
Luik and Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs. After his 
talks, Kinkel warned Moscow against "adding" further conditions 
to delay the 31 August 1994 deadline for the withdrawal of the 
Russian forces from Estonia and Latvia.

  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer 
(Christian Democratic Union) has announced an overall solution 
for the approximately 380 tonnes of pesticide toxic waste from 
the former German Democratic Republic [GDR] that has been stored 
in Albania for nearly two years. As he stated at a news 
conference today, he will present a concluding report next week. 
At the Bundestag on Thursday [10 March], he indicated that the 
pesticides transported to Albania are to be returned to Germany 
"in a more or less legal way" and disposed of here. 
  However, the financial aspect of the operation has 
apparently 
not yet been settled. The Finance Ministry has not yet released 
the 1.4 million German marks [DM] needed to handle the toxic 
waste, which is mainly stored in a train of the GDR Railroads. 
The costs for the return and disposal are expected to be much 
higher. A similar operation during which waste from Romania was 
transported back to Germany involved about DM10 million.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS] expects to enter the European Parliament and the 
Bundestag. The Federal Government does not have any "feeling" 
for the east Germans, PDS Bundestag Group chairman Gregor Gysi 
said on Friday [11 March] shortly before the opening of a party 
congress in Berlin. Therefore, he is optimistic that his party 
will exceed the 5-percent threshold. 
  The party sees "realistic prospects" for getting a direct 
mandate in 10 east German constituencies. Therefore, it will 
"struggle very vehemently for first votes" there, Gysi said. In 
the old laender, the struggle will be pursued for the second 
votes. Andre Brie, the party's election campaign leader, 
calculated that the PDS wants to get 18 to 20 percent of the 
votes in the east and 1.5 to 2 percent in the west and thus jump 
over the 5-percent threshold. In the Bundestag election 
campaign the PDS will put the topics of mass unemployment, basic 
social safeguards, as well as the opposition against social 
cutbacks and a shift to the right into the center of its 
activities. 
  At the three-day party congress the 524 delegates, who 
represent 131,406 members, intend to adopt their ticket of 
candidates for the European elections as well as the programs 
for this election and for the Bundestag election. It is 
considered certain that Bundestag Deputy Hans Modrow, the former 
GDR premier, will head the ticket. The announcement that the 
Dresden public prosecutor's office will indict him for 
intentional false statements under oath threw a shadow on his 
nomination. Nevertheless, the PDS will nominate Modrow, PDS 
Chairman Lothar Bisky stressed.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After the defeat in the Lower Saxon 
election, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Chairman Klaus 
Kinkel appealed to his party to mobilize all forces now for the 
coming elections. The election result is sad and there is no 
reason to extenuate it, Kinkel said on Monday [14 March] in 
talks of FDP leadership bodies in Bonn. Nevertheless, he sees 
no reason "to repent in sackcloth and ashes." One must now roll 
up one's sleeves and look ahead and fight for better results. 
Kinkel said that he was anything but pessimistic and was 
certain that better results would follow. 
  According to Kinkel, the FDP's poor result also had 
something 
to do with the "dilemma" into which the FDP has been forced in 
the coalition in Bonn. On the one hand, it wants to complete 
the full term of the coalition in an orderly way, while on the 
other, it also wants to prove its independence. Moreover, the 
governing parties, especially those in Bonn, are currently 
blamed for all things negative. Asked whether support for the 
nursing-care insurance contributed to the FDP losses, Kinkel 
said that it was he, in particular, who wanted the nursing-care 
insurance. One must not put off such an important issue merely 
out of consideration for election results. Only if one keeps to 
one's course in difficult days and situations can one prove that 
"one has got some backbone." 
  In Lower Saxony, the FDP lost 1.6 percentage points, only 
achieving 4.4 percent, and is no longer represented in the 
Landtag. FDP Honorary Chairman Lambsdorff rejected blaming 
Chairman Kinkel for the defeat. Kinkel is a generally 
respected, good foreign minister, and a greatly liked and 
confident personality for the FDP. Kinkel's deputy, Irmgard 
Schwaetzer, said that although she was sad, the result was not a 
disaster. Hermann Otto Solms, chairman of the FDP Bundestag 
group, said that it was not obvious what the FDP's function 
should have been in Lower Saxony.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU] 
Chairman and FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel has called for a 
basic redefinition of German foreign and security policies. At 
a CSU foreign political congress in Munich on Saturday [12 
March], Waigel said that Germany has to vacate the "box seat of 
a passive observer" in world politics and become active in 
international security policies together with its European 
neighbors. 
  An end must finally be put to the phoniness of some citizens 
who get all worked up in front of the television set every 
evening because of terrible pictures from the world and 
demonstrate against international missions of German soldiers on 
the next day. The assumption of more international 
responsibility, however, also requires Germany to remain a 
"cosmopolitan country that is friendly toward foreigners," the 
CSU chairman stressed. Humanity and tolerance are 
unrenounceable characteristics of the Christian-Occidental 
culture. 
  Waigel reaffirmed his party's claim to participation in the 
shaping of foreign policy questions. His office in the Bonn 
government with international monetary and financial policies 
provides good opportunities to influence issues because "more 
things happen during the G-7 meetings than in the traditional 
circles where the foreign politicians have their pictures taken 
and not much is achieved."

  [Excerpt] Munich (DPA) -- In 1994, on an annual average, 
FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of 
Germany) expects approximately 450,000 more unemployed than last 
year, despite an economic growth of 1 to 1.5 percent. The 
reduction of jobs in large enterprises is continuing and cannot 
be balanced by new jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises, 
Rexrodt said at the opening of the 46th International Trade Fair 
(IHM) in Munich (until 20 March) on Saturday [12 March]. 
  The end of the employment crisis can be expected in 1995 at 
the earliest, with a presumable growth of 2 to 2.5 percent. 
Rexrodt, Trade President Heribert Spaeth, and Bavarian Minister 
President Edmund Stoiber (Christian Social Union) paid tribute 
to the latest wage agreements and the first step toward more 
flexible working hours as a step in the right direction. Labor 
costs are too high, it was stated. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Publitalia, Berlusconi To Submit </F>
Statement to Scalfaro"] 
  [Text] Milan, 10 Mar (ANSA) -- Media 
magnate-cum-neo-politician [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi will submit a statement to Head of State Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro on Friday [11 March] in which he decries the actions of 
the Milanese magistrature's office with regard to a probe into 
Publitalia, the advertising arm of the Berlusconi empire. 
  In the statement Berlusconi will insist that the charges 
levelled against Pubitalia are nothing more than "a house of 
cards. There are no skeletons in our closet," he quipped this 
evening. "At the most one might find a couple of crutches," he 
continued. 
  Then, getting more serious, Berlusconi said that the rules 
must apply to all, and that that went for public ministers as 
well, "who should respect these rules even more than the others." 
  Six persons, including the chairman and two managers of 
Publitalia, were reported by a Berlusconi channel Wednesday as 
being the objects of preventive detention requests in a case of 
alleged false invoices to cover a 6.5 billion lire kickback in 
the world record transfer of soccer star Gianluigi Lentini for 
an official 18 billion lire from Torino to AC Milan 18 months 
ago. 
  Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello 
Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano 
Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named 
Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5 
news [TG5] admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but 
stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to 
take flight. 
  "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely 
risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are 
turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the immediate 
comment of Berlusconi, the Fininvest owner, who stepped down 
from the helm of his media-to-retail empire when he took the 
political field with his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to 
beat the left in the March 27-28 elections. 
  At a press conference today Berlusconi claimed that within 
the Clean Hands pool of magistrates there were those who sought 
justice and those who played politics. 
  Meanwhile Justice Minister Giovanni Conso has opened an 
investigation into the leaking of the names of those Fininvest 
managers to be served warrants, names which were made public by 
TG5 before the preliminary judge in the case arrived at any 
decision in the matter. 
  Meanwhile, it was learned here this evening that Berlusconi 
and Adriano Galliani, respectively president and managing 
director of the professional First Division soccer team, Milano, 
could, within the next few days, be called before Milan judges 
looking into the transfer of Gianluigi Lentini from Torino to 
the Milano team. The former head of the Torino team, Gianmauro 
Borsano, gave testimony today.

political struggle behind it, but nevertheless we must have 
confidence in the institutions," the Popular Party's Giuseppe 
Gargani said. "I have been saying for some time that the 
magistrates are going too far and that justicialism does not 
pay," Giovanni Pellegrino -- senator and representative of the 
PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] extreme moderate wing -- 
said. 
  Liberal Alfredo Biondi urged Minister Conso to open an 
inquiry in order to dispel any suspicions of interference in the 
conduct of the elections. "A few days ago," Biondi said, 
"Attorney Spazzali asked to have [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and 
[PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema called as witnesses in a matter 
that needed to be clarified, but the court turned down the 
request," deeming it "irrelevant." Now, however, the threat of 
arrest is brandished even in seeking to discover on what terms a 
football player has been bought and sold. The charge is leveled 
that justice is being conducted by "alternating current." 
  The Liberals' Raffaele Costa, a Forza Italia candidate, also 
condemned the judiciary, talking about "inquiries conducted 
according to the clock." Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli, another 
Forza Italia candidate and former member of the CSM [Higher 
Magistrates Council], said: "The judiciary has decided to enter 
the arena in this election campaign, and it is clear in favor of 
whom. The rules of the law-based state are being destroyed: An 
inquiry lasting over 16 months and referring to events in 
1990-91 is reaching its final stage, just three weeks before the 
elections." All this, while the Milan court considers the 
evidence of Occhetto and D'Alema "irrelevant" in the Cusani 
trial. 
  According to Gianfranco Miglio, the Northern League's 
ideologue, "there is undoubtedly a tenacious attitude on the 
part of the judiciary in pursuing certain individuals involved 
in the political struggle," while National Alliance's 
coordinator Gianfranco Fini criticized "sectors of the judiciary 
closely associated with the left." In Genoa Bossi thundered: 
"Bribe City is a sham; we have seen no proper sentences" (and 
he repeated that the League represents the new and Forza Italia, 
the old.) 
  But not everyone is attacking the judges. Some people defend 
them, such as Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto Bertinotti or 
former magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (Democratic Alliance): "It is 
entirely untrue that the magistrates take orders from Violante 
[anti-Mafia committee chairman], as is being whispered in 
parliament. I am well acquainted with the world of the Italian 
judiciary and I can assure you that such a hypothesis lies 
beyond the realm of possibility." According to the PDS' Nicola 
Colajanni, a former magistrate, Berlusconi is leveling charges 
at the judiciary "because he confuses his economic enterprise, 
Fininvest, with his political enterprise, Forza Italia, and this 
prompts him to consider that a search carried out at his offices 
constitutes a political attack; but it is not so." Massimo 
D'Alema, PDS lower house floor leader, said: "The Fininvest 
inquiry? I hope that there will be a sense of proportion on the 
magistrates' part. I believe in the judiciary," Italian Popular 
Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli said. However, he then made 
the following cutting remark about Berlusconi: "In an attack of 
megalomania, he asked us to dissolve ourselves. He may be 
confident that we will not do so." Former President Francesco 
Cossiga cited [former President] Pertini, pointing out that 
judges, and especially prosecuting attorneys, "must not only be 
independent but also be seen to be so."

<F P=106> [Enrico Marro report: "Berlusconi Snubs Confindustria: `I </F>
Will Not Sit Down With People I Do Not Like'; Abete: We Will 
Not Respond to Provocations"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The rupture between [Forza Italia leader] 
Silvio Berlusconi and Confindustria [General Confederation of 
Italian Industry] occurred within the space of only a few hours, 
yesterday morning. At the headquarters of the employers' 
federation in Rome's exhibition center area Chairman Luigi Abete 
was presiding over a meeting of the Council, Confindustria's 
parliament. 
  Berlusconi should have been there, too, being a member. But 
Forza Italia's leader was busy with his election campaign. 
  Almost deliberately, he happened to be just a few kilometers 
away, on a visit to another professional organization, 
Confartigianato [General Confederation of Italian Artisans and 
Craftsmen], which is often in dispute with big industry. On via 
dell' Astronomia industrialists discussed the delicate political 
situation and the prospects of economic recovery. On via San 
Giovanni in Laterano Berlusconi snubbed them, and attacked them. 
  "I do not often visit Confindustria," he told artisans, 
whose 
vote he is seeking. "I am a member of the Council, but I do not 
go there gladly because I do not like to sit down with people I 
do not like. They breathe a rarefied air there, not that of the 
trenches, of work. Furthermore, I have always had the 
impression that the people sent to work for Confindustria are 
the ones better not left to work in the factories. Those fine 
people often have other things to do...." 
  After the Council meeting finished Abete gave a press 
conference. Reports of Berlusconi's remarks had not yet arrived. 
Asked to make a statement about Fininvest's legal troubles, the 
chairman replied diplomatically: "We must ask magistrates to 
abide by the rules and we must have confidence in the quality of 
their conduct. Citizens' rights must be protected in a modern 
society that does not want to be medieval and that wants to have 
confidence in justice." 
  Abete also sought a complex equilibrium in connection with 
political issues: Confindustria is not siding with any of the 
alignments, and is indeed "disappointed" with an election 
campaign that everyone is conducting by dint of slogans, 
completely ignoring matters of policy. 
  If no clear majority emerges from the elections, better a 
transitional government that will complete the electoral law 
than the labored continuation of the legislature. The press 
conference was over. 
  But a few minutes later the news agencies reported the 
remarks just made by Forza Italia's leader. Abete was surprised 
and resentful: Berlusconi's statements seemed offensive to 
Confindustria and are doubly serious coming from a member. The 
chairman paused for a moment to prepare a reply -- angry but 
detached. It took only a few lines: "Confindustria states that 
it does not intend to allow itself to be manipulated in the 
conduct of a party election campaign, nor to allow itself to 
become involved in a coarse political rivalry. Just as in the 
recent past it has ignored provocations from other party 
representatives, so Confindustria does not intend to respond to 
this latest one, either." 
  Chairman of the young industrialists, Aldo Fumagalli, took 
issue directly with Berlusconi, however: "Let Berlusconi 
remember that Confindustria is a voluntary organization 
comprised of 110,000 enterprises, which evidently think 
differently from him. If Berlusconi had attended the Council's 
proceedings more assiduously, his assessment would now probably 
be more balanced." 
  Former Confindustria Chairman Ernesto Gismondi, a candidate 
for the progressive forces in Milan, reminded the Forza Italia 
leader and Fininvest boss provocatively of "the enormous benefit 
that his group, with its huge debts, was able to enjoy from the 
reduction in the cost of money, which was the result of one of 
the many battles waged by Confindustria." 
  There has never been much fellowship between Berlusconi and 
the employers' federation. At the beginning of his career 
Berlusconi felt snubbed by the major potentates of Italian 
capitalism. 
  He probably now wants to take his revenge and to exploit 
this 
front too. Furthermore, Berlusconi's chief enemy is one of 
Confindustria's top men -- Carlo de Benedetti, president of 
Olivetti and owner of the L'ESPRESSO-LA REPUBBLICA publishing 
group. He is almost certainly one of the "people I do not like" 
cited by Forza Italia's leader in his attack on Confindustria. 
  Last, there is certainly no love lost between Berlusconi and 
the present Confindustria chairman. Abete is a committed 
supporter of an active role for the organization, has little 
sympathy for uncommitted associates, and is certainly not among 
Forza Italia's supporters. 
  Furthermore, Berlusconi does not know what to do about 
Confindustria's position on the elections: The organization has 
not expressed a preference for any of the alignments, nor can it 
do so, in view of the fact that within it there are such 
opposing viewpoints as those of Berlusconi and de Benedetti, for 
instance. 
  Berlusconi's aim with yesterday's rupture -- which has been 
in the air for some time -- is probably to gain more support 
from small entrepreneurs, professionals, and the self-employed, 
which groups have always been critical of the predominant role 
played by Confindustria.

<F P=106> [Report by Gianluigi Da Roldt: "Maroni: It Is Our Job To </F>
Lead the Government"] 
  [Text] London -- Roberto Maroni [Northern League lower 
house floor leader] has no doubts, the Northern League alone 
offers a true turn toward free trade in Italy. [Northern League 
Secretary] Umberto Bossi's candidate for prime minister sought 
to explain this to the City of London, to dozens of financiers 
who handle multibillion lire deals and who want to know whether 
Italy can be a "fertile ground" for investments and, in 
particular, be politically stable. 
  Maroni, accompanied by Senator Giancarlo Pagliarini and 
Lombard League Secretary Luigi Negri, did his best. He met 
people from Morgan Grenfell, Mercury, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, 
and Japanese Nomura, the world's largest investment company. 
Bossi's lieutenant left the answers to the more technical 
questions to Pagliarini, reserving for himself the description 
of the political framework and stressing, on a couple of 
occasions that "it is we who will be winning these elections." 
  The style of the League's visit to the city was purposely 
one 
of "understatement," low-keyed compared with [secretary of the 
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto's visit on 25 
February: short, direct meetings at the offices of the 
financial groups, a "cut and thrust" in English, in the first 
person, by either Maroni or Pagliarini, very pragmatic. With a 
pinch of venom at the end of the speech at Barclays, Maroni 
commented: "We are not here for the elections. We were invited 
and therefore we came to talk to investors and to financiers, 
not to London School of Economics students." 
  But Roberto Maroni's interventions all started from the same 
point: "We are the political force which in these years has 
come into the limelight with an increase in votes which would 
impress anybody." Someone in the know, as if living in Milan, 
asked him about his relationships with ally [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi, about Fininvest's financial difficulties, 
and whether the League intended to bring in a law on television 
news. 
  Maroni took the question head-on. "I believe that after 28 
March a leadership problem will present itself inside the 
electoral coalition which we are a part of. The electors will 
decide: We have the North, let us see what position Berlusconi 
will take in the South." In substance, sharing Umberto Bossi's 
line, Maroni gives the impression of distancing himself more 
politely from Berlusconi: It is the League which should be at 
the rudder of the change, it is the League's men who can ensure 
political change in Italy. 
  On the issue of TV news, Maroni gave no joy to anyone hoping 
for new polemics: "We have already spoken, also with 
Berlusconi, on this topic. We are against monopolies, both 
private and public, and will therefore be proposing a 
broadcasting act, also an antitrust law covering other sectors 
such as newspapers. In this way Berlusconi will be able to 
prove that he is a great entrepreneur and not, as people say, a 
favorite of [former Prime Minister] Craxi." 
  However, Bossi's lieutenant wanted to insist on the 
political 
stability which the "pole of freedoms" was offering. "We and 
Forza Italia have a free trade program which is 95 percent 
similar. Hence, if we win, Italy can make a fresh start. If the 
`pole of the left' wins, on the other hand, the problems will 
start all over again. They agree on almost nothing between 
themselves." And what about the government? Could there be 
switches in alliances? To which Maroni curtly replies: "If we 
govern, we will do so only with our ally." Pagliarini, on the 
other hand, spoke about the Italian public debt and the INPS' 
[National Agency for Social Security] "black hole." It is the 
problem of getting the economy running: "Even if we were to cut 
public employees' salaries by 10 percent, we would not achieve 
major results. The problem is one of increasing the domestic 
product and promoting investment. Nor does raising taxes serve 
anything, Italian companies are already under oppressive fiscal 
pressure." For Pagliarini, the solution is to be found in 
fiscal decentralization, in the reorganization of the state, in 
a cultural jump toward free trade, and "direct responsibility 
for expenditure and receipts," also in the South.

<F P=106> [Ignacio Cembrero report: "Solana Responds to Greek </F>
Presidency's Attacks by Accusing It of Lack of Common Sense"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana 
yesterday set aside his usual verbal caution and attacked the 
Greek European Union [EU] presidency's partiality in the 
negotiation on enlargement which ended provisionally early 
yesterday morning. Solana spoke out against Greek Foreign 
Minister Theodhoros Pangalos, about whom he went so far as to 
say that his remarks lack common sense. At a Congress [of 
Deputies] plenary session, Solana received the People's Party's 
qualified support for the firmness shown by the government in 
the negotiation to admit Norway to the Brussels club. 
  He arrived home from Brussels at 0600, slept for just a few 
hours, and at 1400 held a press conference with Jose Manuel 
Durao Barroso -- his Portuguese counterpart. Perhaps it was the 
lack of sleep, but the fact is that Solana responded to the 
European partners' criticisms with unusual harshness. 
  Pangalos is not in the habit of beating about the bush. At a 
press conference which he held after the abortive round of 
negotiations, he reviewed the concessions made by each 
delegation, and finally emphasized that only the Spanish 
delegation remained inflexible, for reasons which he could not 
understand. 
  Solana stated that he was unaware of the remarks by the 
Greek 
[EU] Council of Ministers president, but he pointed out that he 
had heard him on many other occasions since he has been heading 
the EU. "His remarks," he commented, "do not always impress me. 
They sometimes lack common sense." 
  Greece's stance has caused some disappointment in the 
Spanish 
delegation. It was known that Athens, currently holding the 
presidency, would not behave as the Mediterranean ally which it 
has been on many occasions. "However, we were not expecting 
that the presidency would put us against the ropes," a diplomat 
remarked. 
  Greece's conduct is all the more incomprehensible inasmuch 
as 
Spain has been one of the four EU countries which have hitherto 
refused to take the step of establishing diplomatic relations 
with Macedonia -- Greece's northern neighbor. Athens refuses to 
recognize it until it obtains guarantees of its renunciation of 
its alleged territorial claims to northern Greece. 
  Nevertheless, the Spanish foreign minister denied that Spain 
has refused to strengthen ties with Skopje -- Macedonia's 
capital -- in the hope of receiving favorable treatment from the 
Greek presidency. "Only yesterday, I told Pangalos," Solana 
stated: "Spain is not a country for bartering. This is not a 
case of logrolling. We did not refrain from doing so in the 
hope of some kind of gratitude." He also responded to the 
criticisms of Spain by Klaus Kinkel -- his German counterpart -- 
but did so much more cautiously. His statements asking him for 
greater flexibility seemed to him "reasonable in the framework 
of a negotiating process such as this." 
<H5>  Isolation </H5>
  In Spanish and even in English, Solana reiterated once more 
the Spanish stance demanding of Norway greater access to its 
fishing grounds -- Oslo is offering only 3,700 tonnes of cod per 
year -- and refusing to accept that the blocking minority in the 
Council of Ministers should rise from 23 to 27 votes, as a 
result of which the Mediterranean countries would be left in a 
minority. He strove to prove that Spain is not alone. 
  Although Pangalos praised the Portuguese concessions 
yesterday, Durao Barroso expressed his complete solidarity with 
Spain in its struggle to regain access to the Norwegian fishing 
grounds, which also interest Portugal. However, the Portuguese 
minister distanced himself from the Spanish approach in the 
institutional sphere. 
  Colleagues of the minister acknowledged that not enough 
efforts were made to explain why a country such as Spain, 
anxious to deepen European building, upheld a stance which, if 
it succeeded, would hamper decisionmaking in the Council of 
Ministers. "The ideal thing would have been to carry out a 
major institutional reform," one of them lamented, "but France 
ultimately did not venture to give battle, and we could not do 
so, either, on our own." 
  At the Congress plenary session in the afternoon, People's 
Party deputy Jose Maria Robles Fraga urged the government to 
hold its ground in the negotiation. "If you block," he stated, 
"do not do so in the darkness and solitude to which you have 
accustomed us. Do not give in, Mr. Minister; you are not alone 
in Brussels," because you have the support of public opinion and 
of the parliamentary forces. "If they tell you: `Not one more 
fish or one more vote,' you will have to tell them: `Or one 
more country.' I am very glad to know that the People's Party 
is behind the government," Solana replied.

<F P=106> [Article signed FSS: "Von Roll's Business in Iraq -- </F>
Investigation Nearly Concluded -- Three-Year Inquiry Into 
Illegal Export of Military Hardware"; as released by Bern 
ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern, 11 Mar (ATS) -- The investigation undertaken 
against Von Roll SA for the suspected illegal export of military 
hardware to Iraq is about to end, said the president of the 
Court of Criminal Appeal of the Federal Tribunal, Karl Spuehler, 
to ATS on Friday [11 March]. If there had not been a hint of 
illegal intrigue, then we would have noticed it a long time ago, 
said the examining magistrate with regard to a possible 
indictment. 
  On 18 March 1991, the Federal Council ordered an inquiry 
into 
Von Roll SA in Bern, as well as a Vaud-based company. The 
federal examining magistrate, Monique Saudan, has been following 
the case for three years. The inquiry is concentrating on a 
number of deliveries to Iraq of what were said to be materials 
for building presses. These deliveries were made between 1989 
and 1990. 
<H5>  Iraqi Supergun </H5>
  An inquiry opened in May 1990 by the Swiss public 
prosecutor's office concluded that there was a suspicion of the 
manufacture and illegal delivery of weaponry, which is said to 
have been used in the manufacture of the Iraqi "supergun." 
  Although the inquiry has taken a particularly long time, 
Federal Judge Karl Spuehler said that it is not a question of 
being delayed. The president of the Court of Criminal Appeal, to 
whom Judge Monique Saudan must make a monthly report, explained 
that there were three reasons for the long duration. 
  First of all, the matter is extremely complex. The case has 
international ramifications, and is therefore linked to requests 
for judicial cooperation, which take a lot of time. Moreover, 
certain interim decisions were attacked by defense. 
<H5>  No Specific Date </H5>
  On the basis of the most recent interim reports from Judge 
Saudan, Judge Spuehler predicts that the final report will be 
submitted within the "foreseeable" future. Mrs. Saudan herself 
did not wish to communicate the specific date for the submission 
of her final report. Nor did she want to say if she will 
recommend an indictment. She limited herself to stressing that 
if there had been no hint of guilty intrigues, then this would 
have been noticed a long time ago. 
  Judge Saudan will have to forward her report to Appenzell 
public prosecutor Felix Baenziger in Trogen [Aargau canton]. 
Mr. Baenziger was appointed as extraordinary federal public 
prosecutor for this case. He is the one who will decide, if 
necessary, whether a complaint should be filed against the 
management of Von Roll, and on what grounds. 
  Under the presidency of Karl Spuehler, the Court of Criminal 
Appeal of the Federal Tribunal will then decide what action 
should be taken. If it approves the complaint, the file will be 
forwarded to the Penal Chamber of the Federal Tribunal. 
  Von Roll is first waiting for the publication of the 
preliminary inquiry report. The Solothurn-based group still 
feels that it has not "knowingly or willingly" committed any 
crime, said its spokesman Victor Bader.

<F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers by </F>
Vladimir Plesnik in The Hague on 3 March: "East Europe Is 
Transforming Itself and the West"] 
  [Text] Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers (55) 
granted an interview to Czech reporters in The Hague on 3 March. 
Prior to the visit to the Czech Republic by Netherlands Queen 
Beatrix on 22-24 March, the prime minister outlined his 
country's views on the issues affecting present-day Europe. 
  [Plesnik] Many leading Czech politicians believe that the 
integration of the countries of Central and East Europe will 
mean far-reaching changes not only for the postcommunist 
countries, but also for West Europe itself. 
  [Lubbers] This is already happening. I will not only refer 
to the Association Agreements with the East European countries 
-- they are certainly opening the gates, and not just to one-way 
traffic. The current world is characterized by the 
globalization of the economy; in this new and changed situation, 
new pressure is coming from those seeking membership to the 
European Union, not only from the former communist countries, 
but also from countries such as Austria and Scandinavia. What 
is the result? Greater competitiveness, tougher competition, 
and new impulses. 
  Let me give you an example: How do we stimulate investments 
in the financially demanding most modern technologies so that we 
stay abreast of Japan or the United States? Until recently, our 
financial system preferred direct taxation, because it 
guaranteed progressive taxes and, consequently, higher revenue 
for the state and the possibility of higher social benefits. 
Now, everything has changed quite substantially. Even the 
left-wing Greens, who were successful in the local elections on 
Wednesday [2 March], have beseeched us: Support indirect 
taxation; it could release funds for ecological projects, for 
other sources of energy. 
  [Plesnik] Do you share the view of some politicians in the 
postcommunist Central European countries that the vision of a 
united Europe along the lines of Maastricht was premature and 
naive? 
  [Lubbers] No, I do not think this at all. I look at the 
Maastricht Treaty on two levels: On the one hand, as a specific 
vision following the culmination of which the Community should 
shift as a whole to a higher level and, on the other hand, as 
something that contains the resources for fulfilling this 
vision. This is not a stiff, rigid strategy, but one that can 
be modified relatively flexibly. I have in mind, for instance, 
the negotiations on the affiliation of Austria and Norway to the 
European Union being held since the beginning of this week, 
negotiations that went into the smallest details. 
  [Plesnik] The Russian nationalist Zhirinovskiy forecasts 
that, sooner or later, the Czech Republic will be swallowed up 
by Germany and, thus, the instincts of previous generations will 
be aroused. What are the Netherlands' experiences with European 
Germany as a partner? Does the country view it as such a threat 
as, for example, some of the Danes? 
  [Lubbers] The Netherlands, as a small country, immediately 
and fatefully depended for centuries on communication and 
contacts with the surrounding world, including an economically 
and politically influential neighbor. This has something to do 
with national identity and preserving and developing it, because 
it is not ingrained forever. I view equilibrium in relations 
with a strong and influential Germany based on democratic 
principles, a Germany integrating into Europe, as a challenge 
and as a stimulus for the Netherlands itself. 
  [Plesnik] Do you think that the Kingdom of the Netherlands 
will "disappear" in the future European federal superstate or 
will it try to preserve its identity? 
  [Lubbers] I do not think that we would be lost in the Europe 
of the future. Society in the Netherlands in recent years has 
transformed itself from a traditional social welfare state into 
a state with a resolutely functioning government and responsible 
citizens and has found a certain equilibrium between these two 
elements. The state is simply moving toward the citizen as much 
as possible -- take culture, health care, and education. Of 
course, the state is not abandoning its mission, because some of 
the most pressing issues can only be resolved on a pan-European 
or even global level -- for example, ecology. 
  Naturally, during the Cold War, while someone was labelled 
an 
adversary, it was simpler to lump people together. However, the 
situation has changed, and it is the task of politicians not to 
make promises that cannot be fulfilled, but to constantly 
communicate with the citizens.

<F P=106> [Interview with Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans </F>
by Josef Vesely in The Hague; date not given: "Peter Kooijmans: 
Moscow Cannot Dictate Terms to NATO"] 
  [Text] The Hague -- Netherlands Foreign Minister Peter 
Kooijmans claims that Europe's security is facing a rather 
uncertain future. Nevertheless, at the same time, he gives the 
Czech Republic a chance of possible membership in NATO and the 
European Union [EU]. He also emphasizes that the alliance's 
policy cannot be dictated from Moscow. Therefore, MLADA FRONTA 
DNES asked him for an interview. By the way, 70-year-old 
Kooijmans will accompany Netherlands Queen Beatrix on her visit 
to Prague in three weeks time. 
  [Vesely] The Czech Republic will officially become part of 
the Partnership for Peace initiative this week. Do you have any 
idea what our next step with regard to NATO could be and when 
the time will come for this? 
  [Kooijmans] The future is so uncertain that it would be 
better for you to banish any exaggerated hopes. The admission 
of individual countries into NATO would, after all, just mean a 
new dividing line across Europe. This could provoke a reaction 
from the countries on the other side of this line and lead to a 
threat to stability in Europe. The Partnership in its original 
form envisaged that all the countries of Central and East Europe 
would be treated equally. During consultations with you and 
among the allies, this concept was gradually changed. Each 
applicant has to progress and do something for membership. It 
is apparent, however, that given proper coordination among the 
allies, it is possible to establish a differentiated 
relationship between NATO and the individual partners. This 
gives them a chance to gradually become familiar with the 
alliance. The changing developments in Europe must also be 
taken into consideration in the future. It must be clear to 
everyone that countries like the Czech Republic will have closer 
ties with NATO than, for instance, Kazakhstan or Georgia. 
  [Vesely] Nevertheless, Yeltsin maintains that not only the 
East European countries, but even other states in Europe must 
not give a thought to NATO before Russia. What do you intend to 
do about this? 
  [Kooijmans] The alliance's policy cannot be dictated from 
Moscow. We must, it is true, take into consideration what 
Russia says, but do not forget that the Western European Union 
(WEU) and NATO complement each other. Each new member of the 
European Union must, consequently, adapt its relations with the 
WEU. Although a new member will only be an observer at first, 
it will not avoid membership later. The guarantees ensuing from 
this are similar to those from NATO. This means that the moment 
a country -- let us say, Sweden or Finland -- becomes a member, 
apart from the Western European [Union] partners, the United 
States is also indirectly interested in it. Moscow should not 
overlook the fact that being a member of the WEU means the same 
as being a member of NATO. Even so, I do not see any threat to 
Russia here. 
  [Vesely] When, in your opinion, should the Czech Republic 
submit an application to the European Union, which is currently 
being expanded to include four more countries? 
  [Kooijmans] A country may submit an application whenever it 
wants. It will come first to the European Commission, which has 
to give its point of view. If it is positive, the negotiations 
can begin. I understand the reasoning of the countries from 
your region that it is necessary to submit the application as 
soon as possible, since the negotiations could be long. It took 
a total of nine years for Spain and six years for Portugal. It 
has only taken two years for the Scandinavians and the 
Austrians, but the four European Free Trade Association 
countries were already participants in the agreement on the 
European Economic Area. It has a regime that made association 
with the Twelve easier. In your case, this will not only 
require political will, but -- in my opinion -- it will also 
involve a formidable process of harmonizing employment, social, 
ecological, taxation, and other standards. 
  [Vesely] It is not pleasant just to be in the anteroom and 
wait until others make a decision for you. 
  [Kooijmans] You are right -- if these were to be 
negotiations between a superior and an inferior, then, this 
would spoil the whole atmosphere. Fortunately, things are 
different: The state applying for membership is not the only 
one who can benefit. The entire Union will also benefit. We 
know that Prague has a certain tendency to proceed independently 
of the other countries in your region. However, although the 
Czech Republic will be ready for admission before others -- and 
this has to be taken into consideration -- the European Union 
will not waive the comparisons that unite all the new candidates 
as a group. Your advantage -- compared with the Finns, Swedes, 
Norwegians, or Austrians -- is that you do not have an arctic 
agriculture or Alps, and so your situation is more like that of 
the Netherlands or Germany. Despite this, it will be very 
difficult to draw the negotiations to an end. After all, this 
will involve a transition from one system to a completely 
different system.

<F P=106> [By Jackie Burdon, Mike Harvey and John von Radowitz, PRESS </F>
ASSOCIATION] 
  [Excerpts] Scotland Yard's chief police officer appealed 
for calm tonight after a third mortar attack on Heathrow Airport 
in the space of five days. Metropolitan police commissioner 
Paul Condon said: "As a community we must keep our nerve and not 
give into the despair that the terrorists would hope to 
generate." 
  He spoke as hundreds of police officers supported by 
soldiers carried out a huge search around the airport for more 
hidden mortar launchers. 
  Today's attack came just after 8 A.M. when four mortars were 
fired towards the Terminal Four area from launch tubes concealed 
about 80 yards from the southern perimeter fence. One hit the 
roof of the Terminal Four building. The others landed in the 
apron area of the terminal, where planes are normally parked. 
  As in the two previous attacks on Wednesday [9 March] night 
and early Friday morning none of the bombs exploded and no 
damage or injury was caused. But once again the world's busiest 
airport was crippled as plane arrivals and departures were 
halted, thousands of passengers moved out of danger areas, and 
roads closed. 
  Terminal Four was evacuated and flights stopped from using 
the southern runway from the time of the first warnings until 
the runway was partially reopened for "short take-offs" at 9.30 
A.M. But police and airport chiefs decided to keep the northern 
runway operating as normal. 
  The southern runway, closed immediately after the attack, 
fully re-opened at 1.40 P.M. and Terminal Four at 2.30 P.M.. 
The northern runway escaped disruption. 
  Mr Condon said he had asked for military help to assist in 
the search for further mortars but claimed army security patrols 
at the airport would not have deterred today's attack. [passage 
omitted] 
  So far the IRA has claimed responsibility only for the first 
attack, but all three incidents have followed a similar pattern. 
  Police said the terrorists had gone to great lengths to hide 
the five-tube trestle launcher used in today's attack. 
  The device was partially buried in scrubland and camouflaged 
with wood, leaves and re-laid turf. It was almost certainly 
fired using a timing device -- long after the terrorists were 
safely away. 
  The attack followed a series of unspecific coded bomb 
warnings to various news media between 0619 and 0641 A.M. 
[passage omitted] 
  Each mortar bomb was potentially deadly, containing between 
half a pound and a pound of powerful Semtex explosive. But 
tonight there was speculation over whether the bombs were duds 
or merely a clever propaganda weapon -- intended only to cause 
disruption but not to kill. Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist 
Branch chief Commander David Tucker offered no explanation as to 
why none of the 12 mortars fired at Heathrow in the three 
attacks exploded, but suggested there was a "mechanical defect." 
  Mr Condon maintained that all the devices were "potentially 
viable" and could have detonated. But security sources in 
Northern Ireland said such a failure rate was unprecedented for 
the IRA. They pointed out that the Provisionals had perfected 
their engineering techniques to such an extent that virtually 
every missile fired in Ulster now keeps a straight line and 
explodes on impact. One senior RUC officer said today: "In 
military terms this is powder puff stuff, and it is quite 
obvious what they are up to... 
  ``The Provos [Provisional IRA] are piddling about. If they 
really wanted to cause death and destruction, they could do it. 
It's second nature to them. What they are doing at Heathrow is 
hinting at the potential. They're having a good laugh, and 
keeping morale high back here in Belfast.''

<F P=106> [By Shenai Raif, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] IRA terrorists brought Heathrow and Gatwick 
airports to a halt this evening with coded warnings of more 
mortar attacks similar to the three on London's main airport in 
the past five days. 
  But the security alert was later lifted and the airports 
reopened after Scotland Yard accused the IRA of a cynical 
attempt to frighten passengers and cause confusion. 
  Hundreds of passengers were stranded in terminals for three 
hours as police and troops searched outside, and incoming 
passengers were diverted all around the country. 
  As in previous attacks, coded warnings were given during the 
evening and followed the third mortar attack on Heathrow this 
morning. 
  But this time Gatwick, London's second airport, was also 
threatened. 
  A new strategic plan agreed between police and airport 
officials, was put into place. All runways were closed, 
together with perimeter roads and public transport was halted. 
Flights, 20 of them heading for Heathrow, were diverted to 
airports as far afield as Stansted, Southampton, Luton, 
Manchester, Bournemouth, Bristol, Cardiff and Birmingham. 
Terminal Four at Heathrow was closed and passengers were told 
they could not leave other terminals at both airports. 
  The first coded warning closed the aiports at 7 P.M. 
Warnings were then phoned to Sky News at 7.10 and 7.35 P.M. 
They said "there will be bombs in one hour's time." 
  They came on the same day that more mortars were fired at 
Heathrow. They failed to explode and no one was injured. 
[passage omitted] 
  Heathrow was reopened at 2130 after tonight's new warnings 
and passengers were gradually being allowed to continue their 
journeys although departing travellers were advised to check 
with their airlines. 
  The security alert at Gatwick ended after a thorough search 
by security services and the airport was reopened at around 10 
P.M. A spokesman said the airport is now fully operational.

  [Text] The IRA tonight accused police of gambling with 
peoples' lives over the Heathrow airport mortar bomb attacks. 
The Provisionals claimed their warnings of attacks were 
deliberately ignored. 
  In a statement, the terrorists said: "The luck of the 
British 
authorities who are deliberately taking these calculated and 
cynical gambles with peoples' lives will inevitably run out. 
Our coded warnings should be heeded." 
  The IRA claimed the authorities failed to "act 
appropriately" 
when they were given what it described as accurate advance 
warning of the attack on the north runway on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The Provisionals accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
Paul Conlon and anti-terrorist squad head David Tucker of 
"arrogant boasting" and claimed a six-hour warning of the attack 
at terminal four had been totally ignored.

  [Text] John Major received the Portuguese prime minister 
this afternoon at 10 Downing Street. Our special correspondent 
Pedro Cid reports: 
  [Cid] As expected, Cavaco Silva and John Major had a lengthy 
conversation, most of which was devoted to matters related to 
the European Union [EU]. Cavaco Silva advocated no further 
discussion of the present EU institutions before 1996, adding 
that in the meantime, it was necessary to make an appraisal of 
what had been achieved and of the implications of enlargement. 
Any further enlargement should only be contemplated after 1996, 
Cavaco Silva said. He said that Portugal has no objections in 
principle to Cyprus and Malta joining the Union in the 
short-term future, nor, in the medium-term, to the EU being 
enlarged to include some East European countries such as 
Hungary, Poland, and the Czech republic. 
  Cavaco Silva said that the present balances within the EU 
should be maintained, but added that the EU should remain an 
open and original model, evolving gradually and amenable to 
readjustments. 
  All the above points were made during the conversation 
between the two prime ministers. 
  Particular attention was also devoted to matters pertaining 
to southern Africa, such as the elections in South Africa -- 
with regard to which Cavaco Silva expressed the hope they will 
pass normally -- peace in Mozambique, and the situation in 
Angola. On the latter the prime minister had this to say: 
  [Begin Silva recording] The Angolan situation is no less a 
tragedy than that in Yugoslavia. The international community 
ascribes great importance to, and, naturally, is very concerned 
about the situation in the former Yugoslavia. however, Angola's 
tragedy is of a much greater magnitude than Yugoslavia's. Many 
more people are dying in Angola than in Yugoslavia. This is the 
reason why I have asked several European leaders to bring all 
possible pressure to bear, if need be through the UN Security 
Council -- should this be deemed appropriate. Portugal would 
not oppose a further meeting of the UN Security Council -- to 
bring strong pressure to bear on the Angolan Government and on 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to 
secure the signing of the agreement currently being negotiated, 
and which has been practically completed. In our opinion, with 
goodwill on all sides it could be signed in the not too distant 
future -- and to insure that this would have repercussions on 
the ground. The fact of the matter is that at present there are 
no practical implications; The situation is now worse than it 
was some time ago. [end recording] 
  [Cid] Cavaco Silva further stated that Portugal is willing 
to 
commit itself even more strongly to all ongoing processes. It 
will not refuse its cooperation in the peace effort in 
Yugoslavia, and is also prepared to involve itself even more 
actively if required in the Angolan and Mozambican questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Charles Clover: "Nuclear Waste Review Likely To </F>
Delay Sell-off"] 
  [Text] Plans for disposing of nuclear waste, much of it in 
temporary storage at sites around Britain, are to be reviewed, 
possibly delaying privatisation of the nuclear power industry. 
  The plans were strongly criticised by the Government's chief 
safety adviser last year. 
  Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, who 
has indicated that he wanted to see privatisation before the 
next election, has been pressing for what some officials call a 
"short and dirty" review. 
  This would focus narrowly on the potential commercial 
viability of privatised Pressurised Water Reactors and would 
report by the summer. 
  But Mr John Gummer, Environment Secretary, is adamant that 
the review should cover both long-term liabilities from 
decommissioning nuclear plants -- costing an estimated 20 
billion pounds -- and plans for disposing of nuclear power waste. 
  A remit for the waste review, to be carried out by the 
Department of the Environment, has been long delayed but is now 
expected within weeks. The review would be expected to take 
until the end of the year. 
  Yet some industry observers say Mr Heseltine must take a 
decision this summer on the sell-off of Nuclear Electric and 
Scottish Nuclear if privatisation is to happen before the next 
election. 
  It was uncertainty about the scale of long-term liabilities 
that led to the nuclear industry being dropped from 
privatisation in 1989. 
  The waste review is likely to focus on plans of the nuclear 
waste agency, Nirex, for a 3 billion pound national nuclear 
waste dump at Sellafield -- and how realistic these are. These 
plans have slipped from around 2003 to after 2010 while waste 
continues to mount at Magnox power stations. 
  The review is also likely to look at costs and strategies 
for 
decommissioning nuclear power stations, many of them closing in 
the next 10 years. This alone will cost up to 10 billion 
pounds. Other liabilities, including disposing of Atomic Energy 
Authority sites and British Nuclear Fuels, bring the total 
closer to 20 billion pounds. 
  Final disposal of waste, which environmentalists say has 
never been properly planned, is expected to cost more than that 
but has never been fully costed. 
  The recent approval given for the British Nuclear Fuels 
Thorp 
plant will probably mean that a lot of extra waste is likely to 
be generated, with nowhere for it to go. 
  Last autumn Prof John Horlock, departing chairman of the 
Advisory Committee on the Safety of Nuclear Installations, 
criticised the quantities of waste piling up at power stations 
and nuclear stores. He called on the Government to ensure that 
the Nirex waste repository proposed for Sellafield came into 
operation earlier than 2010. 
  It is not known if the review will cover reprocessing or dry 
storage. If it were to do so, it would be a new blow to British 
Nuclear Fuels which has just won a 16-year battle to open its 
Thorp reprocessing plant: dry storage is seen by many as a 
cheaper option than reprocessing. 
  Nuclear analysts reacted without surprise to the news of a 
nuclear waste review. 
  Mr Gordon MacKerron, senior fellow at the Science Policy 
Research Unit at Sussex University, said: "There is a clear 
public perception that our nuclear waste disposal policy is in a 
complete mess." 
  "Nuclear Electric will want the Government to clear up all 
the historic liabilities because it is clear that the City does 
not want to take them on." 
  A spokesman for Nuclear Electric disputed whether a waste 
review would mean delay for privatisation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer by Einar </F>
Koch; place and date not given: "Bonn Intelligence Service 
Minister: Why We Still Need Spies"] 
  [Text] [Koch] The Russians are claiming that they have 
exposed a German spy. Is that correct? 
  [Schmidbauer] Moscow briefed us on the arrest of a Russian 
citizen who is accused of having worked for the Federal 
Intelligence Service [BND]. I cannot confirm that at all. I had 
an exhaustive talk with Safanov, head of the counterintelligence 
service. We decided that the Russian side will approach us as 
soon as more detailed information is available. Moreover, I 
asked BND President Porzner to keep me abreast of things. Mr. 
Porzner will return prematurely from his visit to Moscow. The 
next steps will then have to be considered very calmly. It is 
now the turn of the Russian side. The FRG Government is 
interested in avoiding political complications. In view of our 
previous good cooperation with the Russian side, we are 
confident that all irritations will be eliminated. 
  [Koch] Is this the Russians' revenge for KGB agent Ames in 
Washington? 
  [Schmidbauer] I do not rule out that the Ames psychosis is 
spreading among the Russians, since alleged members of other 
Western services have also been arrested in Moscow. 
  [Koch] After the end of the East-West confrontation, do we 
still have to spy on each other at all? 
  [Schmidbauer] In the world as it has developed, it is 
indispensable that the governments procure information. We need 
the intelligence services for it. The work of Western 
intelligence services was and is not an aggressive activity. It 
is legally controlled.

<F P=106> [Article by "fy.": "Grachev's Visit Assessed as Success"] </F>
  [Text] Berlin, 11 Mar -- Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev's three-day visit was determined by efforts on both 
sides to positively shape German-Russian relations in the 
military sphere after the withdrawal of all Russian soldiers 
from Germany on 31 August this year. The visit was concluded on 
Friday [11 March] with a news conference in Berlin, where 
Grachev and his host, Volker Ruehe, concurrently assessed the 
visit as a success. Ruehe said that the intention to make 
special efforts to intensify cooperation after the withdrawal of 
the Russian armed forces ran through the visit "like a red 
thread." Grachev said that the point is that cooperation 
between the German and Russian armed forces will not only be 
improved by the stipulated joint maneuvers and the exchange of 
officers who will participate in General Staff courses in 
Hamburg and Moscow. What is more, it is important to secure 
both the quantity and quality of the armed forces' relations 
with each other "for the foreseeable future." Grachev thanked 
Ruehe for his hospitality. Ruehe, for his part, paid tribute to 
Grachev's preparedness to honor the members of the military 
resistance against Hitler and the assassins of 20 July 1944 by 
laying a wreath in the courtyard of the Bendler Block. The fact 
that the uprising of 20 July had been attempted from the Bendler 
Block is the reason for his decision to set up his official seat 
in Berlin in this building. 
  Grachev and Ruehe largely evaded questions about the 
organization of the ceremonies on the withdrawal of the Russian 
soldiers, which is to take place in August. Grachev said that a 
celebration with the Germans that emphasizes the friendly 
character of the Russian soldiers' return is wanted. Ruehe 
added that the point is to lay the foundation for good relations 
in the future by a worthy celebration. Kohl and Yeltsin have 
made it a business of the bosses. Questions about Russia's 
attitude toward NATO, the Partnership for Peace, and the East 
European states took up a lot of space. Grachev resolutely 
contradicted the allegation that he had advocated a delimitation 
of responsibilities in Europe. The contrary is the case. 
Russia is in favor of a uniform European security system that 
comprises Russia and NATO. At the same time, he confirmed his 
assessment that he had made in Bonn -- that is, that the project 
Partnership for Peace is conceived for a transition period. In 
response to the question of how long this transition period will 
last, in his opinion, the Russian defense minister said that 
this transition period started with the Warsaw Pact's 
dissolution. It will last until the former Warsaw Pact states 
have found their place in the European security system and the 
world. This process also includes their economic recovery. They 
must stop being debtors who have to beg for unlimited loans. Not 
only NATO but also the CSCE, the European Community, and other 
organizations belong to a pan-European security system. In his 
opinion, they should all cooperate under the CSCE's leadership. 
He did not rule out that NATO will also become a partner of the 
CSCE. Grachev evaded questions about the relationship that the 
East European states should have with NATO, in his opinion. 
Moscow wants to see by the example of other countries that 
they, like Russia, are also prepared for cooperation with NATO, 
he said. 
  In response to questions about Russia's behavior toward the 
Baltic states, Grachev said that the view that Foreign Minister 
Kinkel took during his meeting with the foreign ministers of the 
Baltic states corresponds to the current position. Russia 
continues to be in favor of a speedy withdrawal of its troops 
from the Baltic states. However, it does not forego the 
fulfillment of the demands made by it. It will not accept 
apartheid. This statement was understood as Moscow's demand 
that the Russian inhabitants of the Baltic states have the same 
rights as the citizens of these countries.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Christian Wulff, Christian Democratic </F>
Union's leading candidate in Lower Saxony elections, by 
unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Herr Wulff has just come into the 
studio. Are you the biggest loser of the day? 
  [Wulff] I do indeed believe that the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] is the loser. We have lost 5, 6 percent. However, 
I do want to say at this point that I take responsibility for 
this defeat -- that goes without saying. I am the top 
candidate. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] This really is the worst result -- we have to 
have a close look at the figures -- in almost 30 years. This is 
indeed a huge defeat for you personally. I remember you saying 
before the elections that you tried to represent the young, the 
new, the renewed CDU. Was not this what the voter wanted? 
  [Wulff] I think the process of renewal has to continue. We 
were popular in certain groups of the population and put on 
great election campaign events. We now have to continue to 
fight, to work, and I want to do this in the state parliament in 
particular, also as leader of the opposition in order to have a 
different basis from which to start out next time and to win. 
We are of course convinced that our policies are the right ones 
and that this federal state needed a new start. We did not get 
the votes required for this, so we will go into opposition and 
be a good opposition. 
  [Announcer] How much blame for this defeat goes to Bonn? 
  [Wulff] In the last elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Hamburg, 
and Brandenburg we lost 10 percent of the vote and we have lost 
around 5 percent here. That is quite a change. We managed to 
keep the Republikaner out of parliament which is a great 
success. In Hamburg almost 8 percent of votes were for the 
right-wing extremists. We kept the Statt [Instead] Party quite 
small because we have renewed ourselves as an established party. 
Thus, we have some positive signs from this election result. 
But the climate necessary to bring about this turnaround was 
lacking. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] But you will be going to Bonn sometime, of 
course. It is said you once put your foot down there. Will you 
do that again? 
  [Wulff] We think we can see some improvements in Bonn, also 
over the last eight weeks. This was not expressed in the 
election result, but when I see how things have gone with the 
nomination of Roman Herzog, nursing care insurance, and changes 
in bad weather payments yesterday and the day before, then I 
have to say that Bonn supported us greatly in the end, so thanks 
also to Helmut Kohl, Peter Hintze, and others in Bonn, who 
fought like Frau Merkel, Herr Wissmann here, a great thing. So 
we also have support in Bonn, to whom we owe our thanks.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- This morning the Free Democratic 
Party [FDP] Presidium described its election defeat in Lower 
Saxony as a warning not to be ignored. Before the FDP Executive 
meeting which followed, party chairman Klaus Kinkel said it is 
now time to "roll up our sleeves." 
  Kinkel regards the FDP's difficulty as walking a tightrope 
between loyalty to the coalition and taking a position of its 
own: "The FDP has the problem that it is a coalition partner in 
Bonn and, as far as actual issues and style are concerned, it 
wants to bring this coalition to a respectable end and it will 
do so. On the other hand, we have to show independence. So we 
are caught in a bind."

recognize the Republic of Kosova as a sovereign and neutral 
state." German Deputy Peter Reuschenbach greeted the rally. 
Here is a report by Mimoza Cika: 
  [Cika] With their participation today in the protest under 
the leadership of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branch, 
all Albanians who live and work in Germany showed that they are 
living proof of the national and political determination and 
devotion. 
  LKD Branch Chairman Afiz Gagica addressed the demonstrators 
and stressed the motto of this protest. 
  Mr. Peter Reuschenbach, chairman of the parliamentary group 
to the German Bundestag for Albania, also greeted the 
demonstrators. 
  Various representatives of high-level German organizations 
and bodies also greeted the rally participants. The petitions 
addressed to the high-level German authorities are based on the 
main demands to stop the violence and the Serbian systematic 
state terror against the Albanian population in Kosova and to 
prevent the eruption of an armed conflict in the Republic of 
Kosova by withdrawing the armed police forces from the Republic 
of Kosova. They also asked Germany and the united international 
states to recognize the independence of the Republic of Kosova.

  [Excerpt] Peter-Michael Diestel, deputy for the Christian

president of the East German Committee of Associations. 
According to a declaration, the committee sees itself as an 
east German chamber that wants to participate in the lawmaking 
process and thus represent the interests of the east German 
population. 
  Wolfgang Richter, the first vice president of the committee, 
said that, since the annexation of the GDR to the FRG, one 
partner to the unification treaty ceased to exist, the committee 
is taking up the idea of a third chamber. It should mainly be 
concerned with harmonizing living conditions in east and west 
and guaranteeing the basic supply of work, living space, health 
care, and pensions. For this purpose, the committee, which 
includes more than 40 associations with 1.5 million members, 
wants to turn to the Bundestag to be included in hearings and 
debates on draft laws. An east German federal congress is due 
to be held on 28 May 1994 intended to discuss social-policy 
questions and election criteria for the parties. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Bart Willems: "Germans Are Arming Themselves </F>
Via Belgium on Massive Scale"] 
  [Text] In the heavily guarded offices of the Bundes 
Kriminal Amt (BKA, Federal Investigation Department), the 
service yesterday presented the results of a nationwide arms 
raid that yielded more than 1,000 weapons of Belgian origin. 
The haul ranged from handy, light arms for ladies to 
ultramodern, fully automatic Uzi's. At the same time, the 
German justice authorities expressed severe criticism of the 
liberal Belgian arms legislation. 
  The house search action, "a raid on law-abiding citizens who 
arm themselves," resulted in more than 750 apartments being 
searched. A total of 2,247 agents were deployed throughout 
Germany, bringing hundreds of people out of their beds from 0500 
GMT Wednesday [9 March] morning. The largest number of holders 
of illegal firearms live in the border area, just a 30-minute 
drive away from Liege. However, major caches were found in 
Berlin, too. "It is curious that someone should drive 600 km 
there and back to buy a weapon," noted the BKA. 
  In all, 1,049 weapons were found in the searched houses. 
They included revolvers, rifles, and automatic machine pistols. 
However, the lion's share of the arms haul comprised rifles and 
handguns. The BKA believes that it only discovered the tip of 
the iceberg during this haul: "We think that the arms 
discovered during this action represent 15 to 20 percent of 
annual illegal exports," said Commissioner Ulrich Kamp, who led 
the investigation. 
  Kamp thinks that his service missed another 250 weapons: "We 
did not find any at addresses where there should have been 
some." One day after the arms haul, it became apparent that 
more than 30 weapons had been used in armed raids, shooting 
incidents, and suicides. The people in possession of illegal 
weapons risk prison sentences of between six months and six 
years. 
<H5>  Arms Tourism </H5>
  "Germans are arming themselves via Belgium on a massive 
scale," was the conclusion reached by Cologne prosecuting 
attorney Egbert Buelles. He was concerned about how easy it is 
to acquire weapons in Belgium. Buelles has been entrusted with 
taking care of the criminal prosecutions arising from the case. 
"The problem caused by the different regulations governing arms 
ownership that apply in various European countries has become a 
burning issue from today," he announced. According to Buelles, 
the Belgian legislation plays right into the hands of this kind 
of "arms tourism." "I hope that the Belgian authorities will 
recognize one fact, namely that the bearing and using of 
firearms must simply be banned." In Germany, the arms 
legislation in application is highly restrictive. The BKA claims 
it is the strictest in Europe. Even the purchase of weapons for 
self-defense is inadmissible. Anyone wanting to come into 
consideration for a permit must take a shooting test. 
  Investigation chief Ulrich Kamp emphasized that the Belgian 
state police passed on the details of the searched addresses to 
the BKA of their own accord. In Belgium, anyone purchasing 
weapons must show their identity card, and it was those details 
that the BKA used: "The purchasers were not aware that we could 
get hold of the information." 
  None of those responsible for the action wanted to say so in 
as many words, but there are major difficulties concerning the 
exchange of information with France. As a result, the question 
concerning the next raid in search of weapons of French origin 
was merely met with a broad smile. 
<H5>  Ostend </H5>
  During the presentation, the BKA did not give any details on 
where in Belgium the weapons had been purchased. The arms were 
neatly displayed on a table and commented upon by an arms expert 
wearing a spotless white coat. Subsequently, Commissioner Kamp 
wanted to make it known that the main centers involved had been 
Eupen and Liege. Because of their location, close to the German 
border, many Germans go there to buy weapons. However, weapons 
are purchased in Antwerp and, remarkably enough, even in Ostend. 
According to Ulrich Kamp: "During the summer of 1992 and 1993 
we noted peak sales in Ostend. Perhaps people combined their 
holidays with the purchase of a weapon." 
  According to Volker Rehm, the head of the organized crime 
division of the BKA, there are no indications of commercial arms 
trading between Belgium and Germany: "However, that is 
certainly an area which we will be keeping a close eye on." 
  Rehm emphasized that the action by the German police had 
been 
of a primarily preventive nature. "We want to warn all those 
law-abiding citizens that they cannot simply go to Belgium to 
purchase a weapon there," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt by </F>
Thomas Neuschwander in Bonn; date not given: "`We Will No 
Longer Be Able To Achieve Full Employment in the Classic Sense'"] 
  [Text] [Neuschwander] Four million people are unemployed. 
That is the highest number since the war, and another half a 
million people will lose their jobs in 1994. What are Germany's 
weaknesses as a center for business? 
  [Rexrodt] One problem is that we have lost our "monopoly" in 
technology and training. Second, we can no longer keep up with 
costs. Third, we have far too many regulations and too much 
bureaucracy. Fourth, we must find new markets, and that should 
be viewed as finding new opportunities and not just as a risk. 
We know what has to be done. The point now is to translate 
that into practice. 
  [Neuschwander] When you took office a year ago, you said 
that German companies had become complacent. Now, when you 
presented the annual economic report, you gave the impression 
that the crisis was over. 
  [Rexrodt] Companies had become complacent, and incidentally, 
that was also true of the public sector. Adjustments are being 
made in the economy, and that is why average unemployment in 
1994 will be higher than in 1993. However, I expect things to 
ease in 1995, even if only moderately. Germany will come out of 
this adjustment crisis strengthened. 
  [Neuschwander] You have called for intensive research and 
development work, but while you have been in office this budget 
has not risen and has in fact declined in real terms. 
  [Rexrodt] I too am hardly delighted that funds for research 
have been frozen. This is counterproductive. However, I would 
warn against linking research and innovation in Germany solely 
to growth in the federal budget. Industry faces a challenge, 
and it must once again place more emphasis on high technology 
and translating the results of scientific research into practice. 
  [Neuschwander] How can one motivate companies? 
  [Rexrodt] I cannot dictate anything, I can only see to it 
that there is an appropriate framework. The economy must be 
given clear signals for the future with regard to subsidies for 
research and the areas on which there will be emphasis, in, for 
example, defense. As far as the technical standards for 
products and investment in future technologies are concerned, 
the economy will have to find the appropriate resources by 
itself. 
  [Neuschwander] New jobs can be created in the industries of 
the future above all. What industries are those? 
  [Rexrodt] That is something that industry itself must know. 
I do not want to decide on its behalf. However, they 
undoubtedly include the aerospace sector and microelectronics. 
We also have to maintain our top position in chemicals and 
recover that position in genetic technology. We should not 
abandon engineering but exploit our traditional strengths in 
this field. In the good years, industry failed to make the 
appropriate decisions -- that was the case in one or two areas 
though not overall. 
  [Neuschwander] In the past, the industries that were 
subsidized were above all the old industries, mainly steel and 
coal. Has the subsidizing of key technologies been neglected? 
  [Rexrodt] We have put billions into key technologies. If 
more is said about coal and steel that is because of the public 
debate, which is very much inclined to focus on the social 
problems experienced by the people working in those sectors. 
  [Neuschwander] Japan above all has scored successes with its 
industrial strategies. Can Germany learn anything from Japan in 
this respect? 
  [Rexrodt] The Japanese Economics Ministry is in the process 
of abandoning its previous industrial policies and adopting the 
kind of approach that we use. It is a mistake to pretend that 
the state can decide what kind of research should or should not 
be pursued. It can do that in its basic research institutions 
and universities, but not in industry. The end result is like 
the Kalkar plant, a disaster. Billions have gone into 
microelectronics in Germany! We possess first-rate technology, 
and Germany can produce microchips of the most advanced kind! 
As for research in our institutes, universities, and many 
companies, we are among the world leaders. 
  Our problem is turning research into products: Frequently, 
we cannot produce in a quantity and with a cost structure that 
would make us competitive internationally. This is an area in 
which we have to catch up. 
  [Neuschwander] Statistics on patents show that we are not 
even leaders in basic research. Between 1987 and 1992, there 
were 216 German patents in the microelectronics field compared 
to 12,688 Japanese ones. 
  [Rexrodt] Statistics on patents are only an indication and 
not proof of the technological maturity of an economy. We 
register patents differently than in other countries. In the 
United States and especially Japan, every second- and third-rate 
invention is registered. That does not say anything. However, 
in our country, registering patents is too expensive and takes 
too long. 
  [Neuschwander] It is regularly argued that Germany is in 
danger as a center for business, because of a costs crisis. Is 
the pressure of costs one reason why innovations cannot be 
translated into products? 
  [Rexrodt] The costs crisis would not be so pronounced in 
certain areas if we had high-tech products above all. However, 
an economy cannot just produce high-tech products. Most 
products and processes are standardized, but we can still 
produce a standard product, an armchair or a table, using 
high-technology processes. As far as the costs crisis is 
concerned, the facts are that we are a high-wage country with 
wage increases that exceed the growth in productivity. 
Ancillary wage costs are a very heavy burden on our companies 
and our unit labor costs are the highest among all developed 
countries. 
  [Neuschwander] If one lowers ancillary wage costs, that 
affects the social welfare safety net, and if one lowers wages, 
it affects what the employee has in his pocket. You can expect 
to encounter considerable resistance. 
  [Rexrodt] It is precisely our policy to overcome rigidity 
and change structures. We do not want to dismantle the welfare 
state and become a low-wage country. We want to shift the 
emphasis. The social welfare system accounts for a third of 
gross national expenditure. We have reduced the social welfare 
budget by 15 billion German marks, that is, 1.5 percent. Thus, 
no one can talk about dismantling the welfare state. 
  [Neuschwander] It is supposed to be a first step.... 
  [Rexrodt] ...and if it were followed by further steps, which 
is not something that I am announcing, the welfare state would 
still exist and would still be the most extensive welfare state 
in the world. If, over a period of two or three years, there is 
no further redistribution with respect to wages and real incomes 
even decline or stand at their 1989 levels, this does not mean 
that there will be poverty in this country. 
  [Neuschwander] Germany lacks 5 million jobs. What does full 
employment mean today? 
  [Rexrodt] It would probably be possible to achieve a certain 
degree of full employment today if labor as production input 
were completely mobile, but labor also means people and ties, 
and it is not possible to achieve this kind of mobility. That 
is why I fear that we will no longer be able to achieve full 
employment in the classic sense of the 1960's. However, we 
cannot allow ourselves to have 5 million unemployed people on a 
long-term basis, and that will not be the case. 
  [Neuschwander] How do you intend to create new jobs? 
  [Rexrodt] To tackle unemployment, we must also make 
adjustments to the employment system that will be of financial 
significance. Those who receive social assistance must be given 
an incentive to transfer to the regular labor market, because 
they will earn more there. 
  [Neuschwander] If one looks at the low wages in East Europe 
in, for example, the Czech Republic, can adjustments to wages 
have any kind of effect whatsoever? Should the emphasis be on 
structural reorganization? 
  [Rexrodt] The emphasis is on structural reorganization. We, 
that is, the parties to collective agreements, must achieve 
changed conditions in the form of more flexibility and the 
appropriate wage agreements for the time being. By transferring 
certain forms of work to those countries, we even have a chance 
to make a contribution to overcoming the costs crisis. Things 
will only become dangerous if we can no longer keep up and 
transfer so much that our integrated industrial structure, our 
industrial network will suffer. 
  [Neuschwander] Collective agreement opt-out clauses have 
become fashionable in eastern Germany. Will they become 
customary throughout Germany? 
  [Rexrodt] I am sure of that. There will be more room for 
maneuver, and in a few years we will have a labor market that 
cannot be compared to the present one, a more flexible labor 
market in the sense that people will be able to work 10 hours a 
week, or 20, or 50, or 70. Whether working hours are to be 
extended or reduced will become completely a thing of the past. 
  [Neuschwander] Anyone who banks on courageous innovations 
and investment finds it difficult to obtain capital in Germany. 
What has to be changed? 
  [Rexrodt] We have start-up capital and other assistance 
programs. In providing capital, the banks perform a traditional 
risk assessment and then make a slight deduction, but that does 
not.... 
  [Neuschwander] ...so one's own home is the necessary 
security...? 
  [Rexrodt] ...exactly. However, I am by no means criticizing 
the banks. Unlike a country such as the United States, there 
are not enough private sources of venture capital on our venture 
capital scene. This not an institutional, but a psychological 
problem. I do not have a recipe for that. 
  [Neuschwander] Incentives can be created in the form of 
higher depreciation? 
  [Rexrodt] That is exactly what we do not want, because it 
means that the risk is borne by the state, whereas the risk 
should be borne by the private sector. 
  [Neuschwander] You advocate an intensive dialogue between 
political, business, and scientific circles. What has been 
lacking until now? 
  [Rexrodt] In the past, dialogue was better with the trade 
unions than with business, better in any case than dialogue with 
the top business organizations. There was something of a 
communication problem between business and the state as a result 
of personal animosities on the part of certain representatives. 
Those have been overcome, even though I still see that there 
are problems. 
  In the case of scientific circles, discussion was 
unfortunately confined to financial problems and qualitative 
issues were talked about too little. I support as a matter of 
urgency the introduction of qualitative standards for colleges 
and institutes that would enable one to link the funds allocated 
to a college or institute to its performance, or a system under 
which the pay of professors or scientific personnel would be 
based more on performance. 
  [Neuschwander] So, how will Germany's economic structure 
change by the year 2000? 
  [Rexrodt] The services sector will undoubtedly expand, and 
the role of manufacturing will decline. Mining will also 
definitely decline. Steel will have to make adjustments. There 
will definitely be a structural slimming down in certain areas 
of manufacturing. Some areas will be transferred to low-wage 
countries. 
  All sectors connected with the environment will experience 
an 
upswing, and that will also apply to transportation, aviation, 
the railroads and the automobile industry. Above all, we will 
experience a boom on an unprecedented scale in the 
telecommunications industry. 
  [Neuschwander] What status will the trades have in a German 
economy with an emphasis on technology? 
  [Rexrodt] If one knows a trade, one will always be able to 
make a living, and that is equally true of both production and 
services, because they are geared toward people's immediate 
needs. Things will always be repaired, renovated, and produced. 
That is why I believe it is more likely that the trades will 
increase their share of the national product.

<F P=106> [Article by "G.B.": "Bundesbank Against Short-Term Public </F>
Borrowing"] 
  [Text] In its recent meeting, the German Bundesbank's 
Central Bank Council agreed to continue to reject short-term 
public borrowing. If the state were to incur sizable short-term 
debts, it would make the Bundesbank's policy of stability more 
difficult, Bundesbank Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said 
in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. Conversely, many 
large commercial banks in Germany would like to see the Federal 
Government issue short-term securities. 
  Legally, the Bundesbank is not able to prohibit the Federal 
Government or other public entities borrowing short-term money 
by issuing tradable securities. Nevertheless, it can be 
expected that the Bundesbank's voice is heard in Bonn. So far, 
the Federal Government borrows money mainly through the emission 
of medium- and long-term securities and bonds quoted on the 
stock exchange. Federal one- or two-year financing treasury 
bonds have existed for many years, but these papers have not 
been quoted on the stock exchange and, compared with the major 
bonds, they are rather insignificant. 
  Yet, in many other countries the state borrows money also 
through the emission of short-term securities, for example in 
the United States, France, or Italy. Particularly popular 
instruments are standardized, and thus tradable, Treasury bills 
with maturities between three and twelve months. In the past 
few years, this form of federal financing, for mere cost 
reasons, did not constitute an alternative, since short-term 
interests were quite often significantly superior to long-term 
rates (inverse interest structure). Yet, this is currently 
changing, which is why issuing short-term securities might soon 
become more attractive. Some time ago, the Federal Government 
created the legal conditions for major short-term borrowing, but 
has not issued such papers so far. 
  The Bundesbank's reservations have to be seen from the angle 
of monetary policy. If one were to use the money market for 
financing state spending, one would narrow the Bundesbank's room 
to maneuver on the money market, Gaddum said. Yet, the 
Bundesbank must continue to be able to operate more or less 
freely on the money market. The Bundesbank obviously suspects 
that it might be maneuvered into situations in which it might no 
longer be able to decide on a major increase of the prime rate 
at the time it wants to, because this would conflict with the 
emission of short-term state papers intended for the same time 
or temporarily mess up an existing market for short-term papers. 
Such cases were reported from other countries in the past. 
  In Gaddum's view, short-term borrowing is not only a 
disadvantage, but even unnecessary. The old principle that 
long-term investment spending should also be financed with 
long-term money is, after all, not wrong. Moreover, Gaddum 
regards it as evidence for the confidence in the stability of a 
currency when long-term spending can be financed through 
long-term borrowing. 
  Should the Federal Government respect the Bundesbank's wish 
and do without issuing short-term securities, banking circles 
believe that this would be a severe blow for the new three-month 
interest rate future (Fibor-Future) at the German Options and 
Financial Futures Exchange. At the moment, there are only few 
short-term tradable financial products that might serve as the 
basis for three-month futures. These include short-term 
Bundesbank papers (Bulis) and the so-called "Commercial Papers" 
(CP), which are mainly emitted by private enterprises. The 
hopes of many bank managers have so far been based on the 
federal authorities, which were expected to issue short-term 
Treasury bills in large amounts. These Treasury bills should 
constitute the most important basis for transactions with the 
Fibor-Future. 
  If the state were to do without the emission of short-term 
papers, it would, in the future, probably also affect 
transactions with money market funds. These are funds that 
invest their money mainly in shorts. While money market funds 
are quite popular in some countries, the Bundesbank's opposition 
has so far stopped the Federal Government from admitting German 
mark monetary funds in Germany. 
  At the moment there are, however, efforts made in Brussels 
to 
permit money market funds in all European Union member 
countries. It may well be that the German law-makers will one 
day submit to this desire. In other countries, these funds are 
usually investing strongly in short-term state papers. Should 
these not be available in Germany, the investment possibilities 
of the money market funds would then no longer be legally, 
although economically, limited. One can assume that such a 
situation would quite suit the Bundesbank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bundesbank Director Edgar Meister by Sigrid </F>
Ulrich; place and date not given: "We Are Not Liable for Damage 
Done by Others"] 
  [Text] [Ulrich] Stock brokers have sensitive noses. They 
are afraid that the financial markets will collapse, they smell 
inflation. Are they right? 
  [Meister] Markets tend toward exaggeration. We will do all 
we can so that the market remains stable. However, one thing is 
correct indeed: The bond markets are currently unstable. Stock 
brokers suspect pent-up inflation and thus rising interest rates 
in the pipeline. Therefore, they reacted so strongly to the 
rising interest rates in the United States and to the 
over-20-percent growth of the German money supply. The strong 
increase surprised us, too. 
  [Ulrich] Not only in the view of stock brokers is the money 
supply, which is the basis of the Bundesbank's policy, a compass 
that reacts to any rusty nail. 
  [Meister] It is undisputed that special factors have 
distorted the real significance for two months now. Innumerable 
new loans and refluxes from Luxembourg have inflated the money 
supply. The state was also involved because of changed tax 
regulations. The money supply is to grow by 6 percent at most 
on annual average. I am confident we can achieve this goal. 
  [Ulrich] Will the Bundesbank now not lower the prime rate 
any further? 
  [Meister] In the future, too, we will sound out any leeway 
for lowering interest rates. Three weeks ago we lowered the 
discount rate because of the favorable price trend, even though 
we had to expect the growth of the money supply to remain high. 
  [Ulrich] Do you blame the so-called gambler funds from the 
United States? 
  [Meister] You will understand that I do not want to adopt 
this term. It is clear that the speculation of these funds 
regarding futures and loans puts a strain on the markets. 
Basically, central banks need not care about where those 
investors, who are bored in gambling casinos, use their money. 
However, we will not permit them to endanger the international 
financial system. 
  [Ulrich] Do we have to fear a financial maximum credible 
accident, if a large bank miscalculates on the futures markets? 
  [Meister] One cannot speak of that at all at the moment. 
However, it is important that, internationally, complicated 
deals in so-called derivatives, that is, options and figures, 
are paid much more attention now. The sums that are shifted in 
this connection, are gigantic and grow rapidly. The global 
players on the financial markets should be clear about one 
thing: The Bundesbank will not spread a net to bolster losses 
from high speculative deals. Nor are we liable for damage done 
by others.

<F P=106> [Report by "he": "Tietmeyer: Increase in Interest Rates </F>
Should Not Be Overestimated"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt -- The latest increase in interest rates 
on the capital market should not be overestimated, in the view 
of Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. It was caused less by 
the events in Germany than by those on the international 
financial and capital markets. No central bank can accept 
direct responsibility for the development of the capital market 
interest rates but can only reduce the expectations of 
inflation. Referring to the German money supply, which has 
soared 20.6 percent, Tietmeyer warned against precipitate 
conclusions, because the money supply reflects a number of 
special influences. Even though it is not easy to distinguish 
the special factors from the trend, in the future, too, the M3 
money supply will be watched closely as one of the essential 
indicators. The decisions of the Bundesbank are based on the 
overall economic development. Therefore, the money market 
interest rates need not remain at the current level.

  [Text] Stuttgart (DDP/ADN) -- The main wages commission of 
the public sector union of OeTV [Union of Public Service and 
Transportation Employees] has approved the employers' offer of a 
2-percent pay rise with a large majority. This was announced by 
OeTV Chairwoman Monika Wulf-Mathies this afternoon in Stuttgart. 
This means the wage compromise deal for the 3.5 million or so 
workers and employees in the public service sector is settled. 
The 36-man OeTV negotiating commission had earlier recommended 
acceptance of the compromise with 29 votes. 
  The employers' proposal provides, among other things, for a 
pay rise for lower paid workers from July 1994. The pay of 
medium- and higher-paid employees will be raised from September 
1994. In addition, the pay of east German employees will be 
brought up to western levels in two phases of 2 percent each. 
Employment-protection measures are also planned in eastern 
Germany. The new wage agreement will have a 15-month period of 
validity to offset costs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dieter Kirchner, main manager of the </F>
Gesamtmetall metal industry employers' association, by Alexander 
Jung; place and date not given: "No New Costs"] 
  [Text] [Jung] Two days before the strike scheduled for 
the metal industry you came to an agreement with the IG-Metall 
trade union. Was the whole thing just a show, a ritual, or did 
Chancellor Kohl put pressure on you? 
  [Kirchner] Not at all. We worked out the agreement 
ourselves, and we are rather proud of that. I make it clear: 
We were not staging a show. 
  [Jung] Were there long faces among your people? 
  [Kirchner] The Gesamtmetall Executive Committee unanimously 
approved the result. Of course, some entrepreneur or other may 
not be enthusiastic. But we have found a fair compromise that 
pays off. 
  [Jung] Medium-sized companies in particular are teetering on 
the brink. 
  [Kirchner] Medium-sized industry, too, will recognize the 
advantages of this contract. We have developed a number of 
flexible models, which had not previously existed. And it is 
particularly important is that we have managed to prevent a cost 
increase for wages. This year's productivity increase may be 
fully invested in improving competitiveness. 
  [Jung] But the goal was to reduce costs considerably? 
  [Kirchner] In the final analysis, we have a reduction of 
costs. We can compensate for the wage increases of 2 percent: 
Until June there are five "zero months." The vacation and 
Christmas bonuses are being frozen for three years; in addition, 
the 1994 Christmas bonus is being reduced by 10 percent. All 
that adds up to a very clear, calculable zero for this year. 
  [Jung] Does that stop the development of entrepreneurs 
nowadays arranging agreements with shop councils on income and 
working time on their own? 
  [Kirchner] I hope so. The area wage contract has been 
opened up a little with the new models so that the companies can 
adjust their work time in line with their requirements. As a 
result, the area wage contract will probably regain acceptance. 
The autonomy of collective bargaining has proved its worth in 
the crisis. 
  [Jung] Is the metal industry contract a model for the 
negotiations in the public sector that are still continuing? 
  [Kirchner] We have integrated the agreements at Volkswagen 
and in the chemical industry. The public sector and the Public 
Services, Transportation, and Traffic Trade Union (OeTV) will 
certainly take the appropriate steps derived from our result.

<F P=106> [Fritz Wirth commentary: "At the Mercy of Others and </F>
Partners"] 
  [Text] The ice-cold diplomatic shower to which the Chinese 
subjected U.S. Secretary of State Christopher was not necessary 
to make it clear that U.S. foreign policy missions no longer 
have the aura of being dominating visits, during which 
superpower United States places its stamp on conflicts. For 
some weeks now the international crisis-management scene has 
become tangibly more lively, more active, and thus more 
complicated. The main reason: Moscow has started to gain 
profile as a new foreign policy figure. This can be seen from 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev's virtually hectic activities 
in the Bosnian conflict and in the crisis between Israel and the 
PLO. 
  This new role of Russia's already has obvious consequences. 
It has made the United States give up its so far very passive 
foreign policy role under Clinton and pursue a constructive 
policy. It has become visible in the Bosnian conflict and in 
the efforts to restart the negotiations between Israel and the 
PLO in the Middle East. No matter how limited Yeltsin's 
possibilities may be because of his serious domestic problems, 
this new foreign policy dualism has positive aspects for 
international affairs. Competition is the best means on the 
international political scene for overcoming budding 
isolationist trends in Washington. Therefore, today's meeting 
between the two foreign ministers, Kozyrev and Christopher, in 
Vladivostok is of particular importance. One can expect 
important decisions on the course and progress in the Bosnian 
conflict and in the Middle East. 
  For the Europeans there is good reason to reconsider their 
own role in view of this development. It is high time for them 
to develop their own predictable foreign policy position. If 
this is not done, they will remain at the mercy of others 
instead of being partners in the new game of international 
political forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F>
Massimo Archidiacono; place and date not given: "Silvio, Why 
Are You Protesting?" -- first six paragraphs are L'INDIPENDENTE 
introduction] 
  [Text] [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi is siding 
neither with the Knight [Berlusconi nickname] nor with the Clean 
Hands Team. 
  He is not upset over the magistrates' accusations about 
Fininvest [Berlusconi business group] and the declarations made 
by [Judge] Borrelli seem obvious to him: What is happening, the 
kickback scandal and all that is involved is only the 
consequence of the "country system" as he calls it. 
  "One could say that the leading businessmen have had to cope 
with a stack of laws -- explains the Senator [Bossi] -- with a 
system of compromises that guaranteed no real clash, foreseen as 
possible under the rules of competition." 
  The Northern League leader drives his metallic-colored car 
to 
the umpteenth election meeting in Lavagna (Liguria) where he is 
expected at 9:00 PM. He knows little about the controversy that 
has exploded between the leader of Forza Italia and the head of 
the Clean Hands team. 
  "It was the parties that controlled everything," he 
continued. "There was a real duopoly and not only in television; 
an entire economic system was divided between political 
oligarchy and the dynastic oligarchy of a few powerful business 
families." 
  The moral of the tale is: "Now Berlusconi is protesting, he 
talks of a political attack, but to tell the truth I really do 
not know what he is protesting about. The judges are doing 
their job, and if they really dig deep down who knows what they 
will find.... There may also be a political maneuver behind 
this. The whole kickback scandal is political, otherwise there 
would be no explanation as to why, at a certain point of the 
investigation, they decided to attack the League, trying to 
corner us, by implicating us with the Sama trap, instead of 
calling on trial all those people that are now fleeing overseas 
in order not to end up in prison." 
  [Archidiacono] Bossi, are you siding with the magistrates 
who 
are prying into Fininvest? 
  [Bossi] No, I am saying that the system of corruption 
created 
a heavily interlaced plot. No leading businessman was excluded 
from this. And I mean no one, have I explained myself? I am 
saying that if the judicial authorities dig deep, they risk 
upsetting everything. However, at the same time the kickback 
scandal was created not to do justice but as an escape valve for 
a system of old parties in difficulty. I see nothing shattering 
about this last incident, rather it confirms that Berlusconi is 
a branch of the old regime: which could even be positive if he 
demonstrates (as he is doing) that he wants to change. 
  [Archidiacono] I insist, the statements made by the Knight 
are resentful, he is talking of "political repression" at his 
expense.... 
  [Bossi] I can well believe that he is shouting, he is afraid 
of being damaged and of losing votes. Already in the North he 
will get nothing because we from the League are there. Now he 
is also running a risk in the South. 
  [Archidiacono] Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian 
Popular 
Party, PPI] even maintains that Berlusconi is suffering from a 
"sudden attack of megalomania." 
  [Bossi] I will not enter into controversies of this kind. I 
could not care less. Our alliance with Forza Italia is an 
electoral alliance precisely to avoid destruction by moderates 
like Martinazzoli. If I was asked who Berlusconi is, what I 
think, I would reply that in the end he is some one that has 
been able to set himself against the old regime.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance leader Ferdinando </F>
Adornato by Alberto Leiss in Rome; date not given: "Adornato 
Answers Serra: We All Stand Together, But To Govern" -- first 
paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] "Relax, Ferdinando," wrote [satirical journalist] 
Michele Serra in L'UNITA the other day. His reluctance to join 
up with Rete and Communist Renewal is a "neurosis" that 
threatens to degenerate into an "obsession." "Take your mind 
off Bertinotti and Orlando and try to focus on the students who 
vote for Rete and the factory workers in the north who vote for 
Communist Renewal." We met the target of the article, 
Ferdinando Adornato, during his election campaign in Umbria. He 
had no intention whatsoever, he said immediately, of quarreling 
with Serra. 
  [Leiss] So there is no neurotic obsession? 
  [Adornato] We in AD [Democratic Alliance] were the ones who 
promoted a climate that would allow different forces to stand 
together. We said, "Being different is not an obstacle, it is a 
source of enrichment." When we proposed a single symbol for a 
single alliance, they accused us of wanting to dissolve the 
parties. Then that is exactly how things went.... 
  [Leiss] Then why all this insistence on keeping Orlando and 
Bertinotti out of government, out of a future "Democratic Party?" 
  [Adornato] Different political traditions can stand 
together, 
but not diverging political platforms. I am convinced that the 
progressives' job is to govern, not to continue playing at 
opposition. I think that this is also of interest to the 
students and factory workers with whom Serra suggests I take up. 
Many of them vote for the League, for Fini, and for Berlusconi. 
Does this mean we should be talking to them as well? 
  [Leiss] Is a more moderate position needed to get through to 
these voters? 
  [Adornato] No. Proposals for radical changes are what is 
needed. For example, we must sweep away the old method whereby 
the parties took possession of the state and society. But 
politics should speak a temperate language and make sure that 
rationality wins over the prevailing climate of brawling and 
bawling. 
  [Leiss] Away with the parties. Nevertheless, when it came to 
presenting candidates and collecting signatures, it emerged that 
a bit of organization is not a bad thing. 
  [Adornato] What I am talking about is the end of the single 
public spending party, of a political system that cut civic 
society out completely. There must be organized political 
forms, of course there must, and we are working to achieve a 
great democratic party taking in the Catholics who jump off the 
centrist fence, the nonreligious, the environmentalists, the 
democratic left .... 
  [Leiss] Without Rete and Communist Renewal? Do the Italian 
situation and tradition not suggest a federative "path" showing 
greater respect for the various individual elements? 
  [Adornato] We are not precluding anyone. We can all change, 
especially now that the ideological preconceptions have gone by 
the board. If anything, it is Rete and Communist Renewal that 
express positions tainted by ideological attitudes. I, too, am 
in favor of federative stages, indeed, it is what is already 
happening, is it not? 
  [Leiss] Does not the brawling spring from turning [politics] 
into too much of a show, a factor for which another "neurotic 
obsession," with television, is responsible? 
  [Adornato] I agree with you there. At times they tell me I 
appear too earnest. I appreciate that a bit of a show does no 
harm, but politics is a serious matter. 
  [Leiss] Does the fault lie with the media or with the 
political leaders? 
  [Adornato] There is something of a vicious circle between 
politics and the media, which push the Sgarbi [controversial 
talk show host and deputy] model. But this Grand Hotel with all 
its chandeliers runs the risk of having nothing real to tell the 
voters. 
  [Leiss] What is there to tell them? 
  [Adornato] At 15 days from the poll, the progressives must 
be 
made aware that the problem is not merely one of beating 
Berlusconi. I am not at all worried by the opinion polls that 
show Forza Italia in the lead. The only ones capable of 
providing a reliable government to rebuild the country are the 
progressives, and the emphasis must be placed on their platform, 
to give it substance and credibility. 
  [Leiss] How, for example? 
  [Adornato] We shall be seeking to explain in Rome tomorrow, 
at the event promoted by the Italian intellectuals who have 
launched the "Ragiona Italia" [Reflect Italy] appeal, in the 
Sala Umberto. The speakers will include the Norberto Bobbios and 
Umberto Ecos of this world, who propose the country should 
follow the path of reason, not the Bossi-Fini-Berlusconi union, 
which has no underlying principles. What Italy needs is a new 
pact between the professions, business, and the world of work to 
take the place of the old deal between evaders and those 
benefiting from state support, a pact that will promote the 
market and development but will not cut off the lifeline of 
solidarity. 
  [Leiss] A pact in favor of a "constituent government?" Is 
Occhetto right to criticize this formula as outdated? 
  [Adornato] I agree that the electorate must vote first, then 
the discussion can begin. The progressives can win. And the 
formula of the old political system is obsolete.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Media statements by Italy's major 
political parties and their leaders have largely ignored foreign 
policy issues during the campaign for the 27-28 March 
parliamentary elections. Exceptions have been the leftist 
Progressive Alliance's internal debate on the role of NATO and 
comments made by several political figures on the recent UN 
action in shooting down four Bosnian Serb military aircraft. 
<H5>  PDS's Ochetto Visits NATO </H5>
  The only mention of foreign policy in the election platform 
presented by the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) on 15 
February addressed the subject in general terms only. A summary 
of the platform appeared in the Rome daily L'UNITA--the PDS 
paper--on 16 February, stating that the aim of the PDS is to 
promote supranational integration, reform the United Nations, 
ensure equal rights for all ethnic communities, develop a 
responsible policy on cooperation, eliminate all protectionism, 
and fight international crime. Regarding Europe, the PDS 
platform presses for a European seat on the UN Security Council, 
increasing the powers of the European Commission, Parliament, 
and central bank, and developing a common European policy on 
labor, research, training, and taxation. 
  PDS Secretary Achille Occhetto publicly disagreed with 
assertions by his Progressive Alliance coalition partner, 
Communist Renewal (RC) Secretary Fausto Bertinotti, that NATO 
should be abolished because the Warsaw Pact no longer exists and 
that NATO now often violates its strictly defensive role, a 
remark reported in the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO on 24 February. 
While visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels on 28 February, 
Occhetto said that Italy must remain in NATO. An article by 
Marco Panara in Rome's LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March reported 
Occhetto's opinion that while it does not make sense for Italy 
to leave NATO, NATO's role must be redefined. "NATO must now be 
equipped to deal with the new and different challenges that 
present themselves to peace," Occhetto said. Panara wrote that 
the PDS envisages NATO maintaining close cooperation with other 
international organizations, especially the UN. In discussing 
his meeting at NATO headquarters, Occhetto said that granting 
representation to major regional areas to prevent the poorer 
countries from feeling neglected was discussed, and added that 
the PDS's intent to "impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role" 
was welcomed by NATO Secretary General Manf red Woerner. 
  On the Balkans, Occhetto said he had no doubt that "we must 
intervene in Bosnia and the international community must take up 
an active position" (LA REPUBBLICA, 10 February). At the NATO 
headquarters meeting, Occhetto defended the shooting down of the 
four Bosnian Serb military aircraft, as reported in the RAI Due 
Television Network on 28 February. 
<H5>  RC Against NATO, Intervention in Bosnia </H5>
  As reported by correspondent Maurizio Caprara in the Milan 
daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA on 24 January, two anti-NATO motions 
were filed at the RC congress held in late January. The first 
motion requested that Italy leave NATO and the second requested 
"fighting against NATO." According to another Caprara article 
in CORRIERE DELLA SEFA of 24 February, in presenting RC's 
political platform, party leader Armando Cossuta reaffirmed the 
demand for eliminating NATO. Caprara emphasized that Cossuta 
called for "elimination" of--rather than an "exit" from--NATO. 
  According to an article in LA REPUBBLICA of 1O February, RC 
has taken a stand against foreign armed intervention in Bosnia. 
As reported in LA REPUBBLICA of 1 March, the party harshly 
condemned the downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. RC 
officials asserted that the action may adversely affect the 
fragile truce in the area. They added that NATO seemed to be 
looking for a pretext to address the Bosnia problem by military 
rather than diplomatic means. 
<H5>  Northern League Ignores Foreign Issues </H5>
  The Northern League has not focused on foreign policy 
issues. 
A 27 February Rome ANSAMAIL Database version of the League's 
platform totally ignored the subject. A rare monitored 
reference to a foreign issue appeared in LA REPUBBLICA of 1 
March, stating that the League welcomed the news of the NATO 
downing of the four Bosnian Serb aircraft. The League statement 
called the action a positive fact and added that NATO's role in 
Bosnia is confirming how essential NATO is for European security. 
<H5>  Forza Italia Supports Military Force in Bosnia </H5>
  ANSAMAIL reported on 28 February that Forza Italia's 
political platform states: "We want an Italy that is once again 
a prime mover in the history of Europe, playing an active role 
in the process of European unification, no longer basing its 
foreign policy on improvisation but on the correct definition of 
its national interests." On the Balkans, LA REPUBBLICA of 1O 
February reported a comment by Forza Italia leader Silvio 
Berlusconi to the effect that peacemaking actions in Bosnia must 
be backed by military force and that "Italy must support, within 
the European Community, the `line of determination,' making 
available its prestige and its military bases." 
<H5>  National Alliance `Cannot Abide' U.S. </H5>
  The National Alliance (AN) "cannot abide the Americans," 
wrote LA REPUBBLICA correspondent Antonello Caporale on 1 March. 
The Alliance dreams of a Greater Europe, with East and West 
finally united and with "no subjugation" to the United States. 
According to Caporale, AN believes in European autonomy in 
political and military decisionmaking and espouses a broad-based 
alliance with South America, with Italy and Spain "as its 
vanguard of special influence." AN also wants a "30-year 
European plan for Africa, which would act as a European pillar 
in competing with the United States and the Far East," Caporale 
reports. 
  According to Caporale, the AN has called for an unspecified 
"revision" of the Maastricht Treaty; for Istria, Rijeka, and 
Dalmatia to be returned to Italy "by means of international 
treaty"; and for Europe to have a seat on the UN Security 
Council. In an interview in the Milan daily IL GIORNALE of 31 
January, AN ideologue Pino Rauti said he "criticizes Americanism 
and mercantilism." 
<H5>  Italian Liberal Party Calls for Renegotating Maastricht </H5>
  In an opening statement at the Italian Liberal Party (PLI) 
congress in early February, PLI member and Transport Minister 
Raffaele Costa has suggested the need for renegotiation of the 
Maastricht Treaty, and in an interview given to IL GIORNALE on 4 
February, Costa said he will challenge the European Union (EU) 
over its "bureaucratic and welfarist approach" and will demand 
that the treaty be "renegotiated and its implementation 
reviewed." 
<H5>  Pact for Italy Embraces `Western Ideals' </H5>
  The only monitored mention of interest in foreign policy 
issues by the Pact for Italy appeared in a 2 March CORRIERE 
DELLA SERA article, which briefly reviewed the Pact's program. 
According to this article, the program called for a foreign 
policy that "espouses the Western ideals of freedom and 
democracy with a view to countering the resurgent specter of 
ethnic, racial, and religious hatred." 
<H5>  Commentary Notes Lack of Interest in Foreign Affairs </H5>
  The lack of a foreign policy in the political platform of 
most Italian parties was commented on by Franco Venturini in 
CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 15 February. Venturini wrote that Italy 
"must learn to create its own foreign policy based on internal 
[Italian] consensus," which means the country's foreign policy 
will be different depending on whether the Right or the Left 
wins in the parliamentary elections. Venturini saw truly 
"revanchist" feelings concealed in AN leader Gianfranco Fini's 
attitude toward Istria and Dalmatia, and anti-Western resentment 
lurking in the fringe groups of the extreme right. On the left, 
the PDS is allied with RC, which applauds Fidel Castro, 
Venturini wrote. In the center, silence reigns and an 
"antihistorical temptation to remain collusively passive is 
still felt." 
  Venturini concluded his commentary with some dark humor. He 
reported Foreign Minister Andreatta's quip that Berlusconi 
rhymes with Zhirinovskiy, that the Italian Republican Party 
organ VOCE REPUBBLICANA had compared Fini with Nazi German 
official Von Ribbentrop, and that Italian Popular Party member 
Rocco Buttiglione had charged Northern League leader Umberto 
Bossi with being a new fuehrer. With this evidence in hand, 
Venturini wondered why anyone would still believe that Italy's 
electoral campaign is neglecting the outside world.

  [Text] And now let's turn to Italian news: the Intelligence 
and Democratic Security Service [SISDE] slush fund investigation 
-- Fabrizio Feo reports on the latest developments: 
  The five former SISDE administrators involved in the slush 
funds scandal have all been sent for trial: Riccardo Malpicca, 
Antonio Galati, Rosa Maria Sorrentino, Matilde Martucci, and 
Michele Finnocchi, who is still wanted by the police, will be 
tried in six weeks. In the meantime, the former SISDE 
treasurer, Ugo Timpano, who was arrested last week, obtained 
house arrest. It is said that he has made the first admissions 
on the movement of funds, termed top-secret, the origin and 
destination of which were not clear; 35 billion lire per year 
and none of it under any form of control. 
  A new, sensational chapter has been opened in the scandal. 
Ten billion lire from SISDE are said to have been spent in 
order to support the electoral campaign of one of the governing 
parties. That sum is said to have come from the money used to 
buy the site of SISDE's new headquarters in Via Polli, which was 
sold to the security service for 25 billion lire by the 
architect, Adolfo Salabe.

  [Text] In response to the request from the United Nations 
to increase the number of soldiers in the conflict zone, Spain 
will send to Bosnia-Herzegovina about 200 more blue helmets, who 
will join the Spanish UN battalion next week. In all, the new 
Spanish contribution will comprise around 200 men, who will be 
joining the 1,200 Spanish blue helmets stationed in the Mostar 
area. It is expected that they will be able to travel to the 
former Yugoslavia during the course of next week. According to 
an official spokesman, a radar detection unit, which locates 
mortar and heavy weapon trajectories, will be sent. The unit 
will comprise six vehicles and 25 men, who will have the task of 
monitoring and consolidating the cease-fire in the city of 
Mostar, which is considered vital for the security of the 
population.

  [Text] The Spanish Government has given to understand that 
in Brussels on Tuesday [15 March] a fisheries agreement could be 
reached with Norway, which would permit this Nordic country's 
entry into the European Union [EU]. However, according to 
official sources quoted today, Saturday, by the Madrid daily EL 
PAIS, there is no compromise in sight on institutional 
adaptations and changes in voting. Meanwhile, the Spanish 
Government has won the support of all the political parties, 
including those of the opposition, in the joint congress-senate 
commission of the Spanish Cortes [parliament] for the position 
being upheld in Brussels in the face of its Community partners. 
  Today, the aforementioned Madrid newspaper carries an 
article 
by Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister of agriculture, 
fisheries and food, in which he reflects on the common fisheries 
policy and defends the Spanish position as regards its partners. 
Albero reiterates the point that on the subject of fisheries, 
Spain has a great interest in a country like Norway joining the 
European Union, but he stresses that this does not justify the 
abolition of the common wealth by pleading geographical 
exceptionality or greater efficiency of management of resources. 
In his article, the Spanish minister of agriculture and 
fisheries recalls that the Spanish fishing industry is the 
biggest and most complex of the whole of the European Union. He 
warns that Community enlargement must not and cannot represent a 
step backwards as regards what has hitherto been achieved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose-Antonio Ardanza, president of the </F>
Spanish Basque Government, by Patrick Lopez in Paris; date not 
given: "Ardanza: `The Regions Want More Power in Europe'"] 
  [Text] Jose-Antonio Ardanza, the president of the Spanish 
Basque Government, is visiting Paris for the first time. He is 
demanding a role for the regions in Europe, and wants to attract 
French investors to his region. 
  [Lopez] On this first official visit you are surrounded by 
ministers and businessmen. Is it not, however, a political 
visit rather than an economic visit? 
  [Ardanza] This visit has three aims. The first is clearly 
political, the second is economic, and our third aim is to 
change the image of the Basque country. I tried to explain to 
Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate, and to French 
leaders the idea we have of our place in the Spanish state and 
in Europe. I believe that, while we are close geographically, 
the French political class does not really know us. 
  [Lopez] Are you not also trying to appear more European than 
Spanish and trying to stress your importance in a Europe of the 
regions, which is nonetheless a difficult exercise in France? 
  [Ardanza] Of course it is difficult (...). European 
construction can only be achieved by abandoning some of the 
sovereignty of the states. For the first time in its history, 
this continent... is attempting a process of peaceful 
unification. It is understandably slow (...). The dynamism 
will be born within the states by the rise of regional movements 
(...). I think that the regions deserve greater powers at the 
European level. 
  [Lopez] Are you satisfied, as a Basque, with the stance 
taken 
by Madrid on the question of fishing rights in the context of 
Norwegian entry into the European Union [EU]? 
  [Ardanza] It is normal that we should defend this sector of 
activity which is important for us. In 1986, when we joined the 
EC, we kept a low profile. Today, we have proved our respect of 
democracy and our competence, and the Spanish Government has 
been a driving force behind the European idea. Clearly, the 
countries now applying for membership have some of the highest 
incomes per inhabitant in the world and they fully intend, 
through joining, to further improve their position. By 
defending our fishing rights we want to put the brakes on the 
implementation of a two-speed Europe with a rich north and an 
increasingly poor south. 
  [Lopez] What were your plans when you came to Paris? 
  [Ardanza] What do we see on the geoeconomic level? In 
addition to the north-south divide, is there not also an 
East-West divide? Faced with development in the east, from 
London to Lyons via the channel tunnel, and in the Mediterranean 
from Genoa to Barcelona, the Atlantic fringe was going to be 
marginalized. That is the purpose of our initiatives: 
developing partnerships between the various regions of the 
countries on this fringe, in particular to avoid having to take 
a resigned attitude toward Brussels. 
  Second, France is our leading economic partner and we would 
like to allay certain fears that your country's businessmen have 
concerning the Basque country. The best recommendations come 
from companies that have already set up in our region. 
  [Lopez] Is it to further attract them that you have granted 
tax incentives? 
  [Ardanza] We have the same taxation powers as a state. In 
the delicate industrial situation our region finds itself in, I 
think it is quite normal to want to attract companies. We are 
not the only ones using this type of incentive and I do not 
think it is what people call fiscal dumping. It is also true 
that the Basque state has always historically intervened in the 
region's economy, but of course I would like the state to be as 
least interventionist as possible. However, we have to 
encourage companies to modernize by helping them financially and 
sometimes by taking stakes in them.

  [Text] In Helsinki, Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin has assured that Russia will fully repay its debts 
to Finland, so that this question, which has been a stumbling 
block in the relations between the two countries, will be 
resolved. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin today started a two-day 
official visit to Finland. The first day's talks have 
concentrated on the bilateral questions and especially on 
questions of economy and trade. 
  An agreement was signed today with which Russia will pay 450 
million Finnish markkas [FMk] of its debt with arms deliveries. 
Finland's receivables from Russia are altogether nearly FMk8 
billion. Prime Minister Esko Aho was of the opinion that the 
payment of the debt to the Bank of Finland with arms deliveries 
was an excellent arrangement that suits Finland well.

  [Text] Industry in Finland hopes for a speedy solution to 
the financing problems in trade between Finland and Russia. 
Mining Counselor [honorary title] Krister Ahlstroem, the 
chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers, 
told Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who visited the 
Confederation, that the industry is especially hoping for 
counterguarantees to be arranged. Ahlstroem also raised the 
Finnish companies' 6 billion Finnish markkas of receivables from 
Russia. According to Erik Forsman, the press director of the 
Confederation, the Russian prime minister did not promise a 
quick solution to the debt problems. 
  [Begin Forsman recording] Chernomyrdin's general assessment 
was that the debt looks a lot bigger from the Finnish side than 
from the point of view of Russia, when they are looking at 
Finland -- your 6 billion is not such a big matter -- but when 
you look at it from our point of view, it is a big matter. [end 
recording] 
  Chernomyrdin, who this morning arrived as a guest of Prime 
Minister Esko Aho, has in addition to meetings with 
industrialists had lunch with President Ahtisaari. The official 
talks of the prime ministers are now coming to an end at the 
State Banqueting Hall.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has, 
during his visit to Finland, which started today, had talks 
especially on the economic cooperation between Finland and 
Russia. Chernomyrdin said that Russia is going to continue, 
despite problems and setbacks, on the reform line it has chosen. 
Our reporter Jukka Palmen has been following Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's news conference. 
  [Palmen] Here at the State Banqueting Hall, or the Smolna of 
Helsinki as it used to be called, the news conference of Prime 
Minister Chernomyrdin has now taken about 30 minutes. The 
matters raised have mainly been economic questions. This visit 
seems to very strongly concentrate on economic questions. The 
unceremonious character of the visit became clear in the 
morning, when Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was received without 
any official welcoming ceremonies, and he has during the whole 
day had talks with Prime Minister Esko Aho and had lunch with 
President Martti Ahtisaari in between the talks. 
  No significant news has come up yet today except that Russia 
will cover part of its debt to Finland with arms deliveries. 
How big these arms deliveries are is not quite clear yet. 
According to Prime Minister Aho, the deliveries are so big that 
they will cover the Russian debt on the clearing account of the 
Bank of Finland. 
  Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also visited the Confederation 
of 
Finnish Industry and Employers and four fairly urgent projects 
were taken up there; projects that Finnish industry would like 
to get off the ground. These are the diesel engine factory in 
St. Petersburg, the production of railway carriages, and the 
Outokumpu mining company project to open mines on the Kola 
Peninsula, among others. Nothing concrete was agreed on these 
either. 
  Of foreign policy questions, the question of the Baltic 
countries was taken up briefly at this news conference when a 
Swedish reporter asked whether Russia will really impose 
sanctions on the Baltic countries if it is of the opinion that 
the human rights of the Russians are not secured in the Baltic 
countries. Chernomyrdin denied all sanctions but said that the 
human rights of Russians, like the human rights of everybody 
else, must be secured in the Baltic countries. I am ending my 
report here, now back to the studio in Pasila.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Gustav Haegglund, </F>
commander of the Finnish Defense Forces, by correspondent Harri 
Korkkula; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] President Martti Ahtisaari has appointed 
Lieutenant General Gustav Haegglund, the chief of the General 
Headquarters, as the commander of the Defense Forces. [passage 
omitted] After extensive Air Force procurement, it is now time 
to develop the land and naval forces, according to the new 
commander. 
  [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, while you are 
commander 
of the Defense Forces, Finland will have to take far-reaching 
decisions; how does possible EU [European Union] membership 
change Finland's security policy status, in your view? 
  [Haegglund] It will open new possibilities for us that do 
not 
exist without the membership. That is one important factor, the 
other one is that of course Finland, as a member of such a big 
Union alliance, will be in a different kind of position than 
being alone, and we would then have to make all sorts of 
policies run in parallel with these partners. 
  [Korkkula] So what is Finland's position if it stays outside 
the EU? 
  [Haegglund] Well, then nothing will actually change in a 
defense policy sense, because then there are no other 
alternatives but military nonalignment and national defense, in 
other words what we have now, and it would be quite logical to 
continue on the same course after that. 
  [Korkkula] There has also been talk about Finland's possible 
membership of NATO. Lt. Gen. Haegglund, will this matter be 
topical while you are the commander of the Defense Forces? 
  [Haegglund] I do not have a crystal ball, so I cannot 
predict 
that. 
  [Korkkula] There has also been talk about the threat from 
the 
East in Finland, what do you think about this sort of talk? 
  [Haegglund] I think it is more or less nonsense. As far as I 
understand there are quite a few internal problems and factors 
in the East currently, and the trend there is withdrawal from 
the West and not pushing into the West. This thinking is maybe 
slightly outmoded. 
  [Korkkula] In the recent report on the EU commissioned by 
the 
government, it is said that Russia might sooner or later bring 
Finland into its sphere of influence if Finland does not join 
the EU, do you agree in this matter? 
  [Haegglund] What else could I do but agree with the 
government while I am serving the government. [passage omitted] 
  [Korkkula] Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, the Air Force is in 
the 
next few years going to take up a large part of procurement 
appropriation in Finland; what other branches of defense should 
especially be developed in Finland now? 
  [Haegglund] Well, the land and naval forces, we have no 
branches of defense other than these three; these must be 
developed in equal measure so that nothing is allowed to become 
completely run down. At the moment, the emphasis is moving from 
the land forces, which were developed recently, to the Air 
Force, and that is quite correct because the Air Force would in 
a few years be the weakest link in Finland's defense: The 
fighter aircraft we have are getting old, and that would leave a 
gap that would have to be filled, so it is now the Air Force's 
turn. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The UN Security Council a short time ago passed a 
resolution calling for the conclusion of an agreement on the 
confidence-building measures [CBM's] without delay. The 
resolution implies a timetable of three weeks by asking the UN 
secretary general to proceed with a longer report on the result 
of his efforts to finalize the agreement by the end of March. 
  According to our New York correspondent Apostolis 
Zoumbanioti, UN circles expect that by the end of this month the 
talks in Nicosia will have made enough progress to make possible 
direct meetings between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish 
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas in New York. The same circles 
consider 29 March the most probable date for Mr. Kliridhis and 
Mr. Denktas to visit New York. 
  The resolution further welcomes the fact that the intensive 
discussions made it possible for the UN secretary general's 
representatives to promote ideas which, it is noted, could 
facilitate the talks aimed at achieving agreement on the key 
issues for implementation of the CBM's. 
  The resolution, which bears the number 902, stresses that 
the 
CBM's are neither an end in themselves nor a substitute for the 
broader political process. It also notes that the CBM's will 
offer significant advantages to both communities and will 
facilitate the political process for the achievement of an 
overall settlement. 
  At the same time, the resolution reiterates the Security 
Council's position that the status quo in Cyprus is 
unacceptable. The resolution also notes that the Security 
Council will proceed with an extensive review of the issue on 
the basis of a relevant provision of Resolution 789 and on the 
basis of the report that the UN Secretary General will submit.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis described the 
latest UN Security Council resolution on the Cyprus issue--both 
regarding the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and the more 
general factors of the issue--as very satisfactory and 
substantive. 
  In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation, 
Mikhailidhis said the new resolution clearly says that an 
agreement must be reached on the CBM's with no delay and that 
the measures do not constitute either a substitute or an overall 
Cyprus solution. They are measures that will open the way for a 
substantive dialogue on a solution. 
  Mikhailidhis also noted that the resolution clearly mentions 
that the current situation in Cyprus is unacceptable and that if 
current efforts fail, the Security Council should study other 
ways for implementing the several UN resolutions. 
  Referring to the draft document on UN ideas that was 
submitted to the two sides in the form of informal documents, 
Mikhailidhis said the Greek Cypriot side has asked for 
clarifications and has taken neither a positive nor a negative 
stance on the draft document. He added that from the meetings 
held so far between President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special 
representative in Cyprus, it seems it will not be possible to 
hold meetings in New York at the end of March. The foreign 
minister noted that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas' recent 
statements do not give positive messages. 
  The foreign minister announced that Hans van den Broek, the 
European Union [EU] commissioner in charge of foreign political 
affairs, will visit Cyprus on 24 March for talks on the Cyprus 
issue and the Cyprus-EU relations.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Greek-language Nicosia dailies on 
Thursday, 10 March comment on UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's latest report on the progress of the proximity 
talks on the confidence-building measures being held by Gustave 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special 
representative in Nicosia. 
  Right-wing I MAKHI carries a 350-word editorial on page 16 
entitled: "Unacceptable Document!" The paper says: "The UN 
secretary general's latest report on the new phase of the Cyprus 
issue has caused strong discontent in Nicosia." On the one 
hand, in his report the secretary general tries to stress the 
dangers and on the other hand, he tries to make the famous 
confidence-building measures look better, by presenting them as 
a panacea! The Butrus- Ghali report is not only reserved for 
making the confidence-building measures look better. From any 
other side, it is also disappointing and unacceptable for the 
Greek Cypriot side because Butrus-Ghali himself abolishes the 
four principles that he had set down in his previous report. 
Now, he wants to present UNFICYP [UN Forces in Cyprus] as 
supra-government and supra-authority, but at the same time he 
demands that the Republic of Cyprus cede some of its powers and 
authority. 
  And not only this! He also demands that the legal government 
recognize the pseudostate's "documents" so that the Turkish 
Cypriots can travel freely anywhere in the world. At the same 
time, he wants the area of Nicosia Airport and the fenced area 
of Famagusta to actually become a "state" of the United Nations. 
The writer goes on to say that if this UN proposal is accepted, 
in Cyprus there will be the most unusual phenomenon with part of 
the island under the control of Greek Cypriots, another part 
under the Turkish Cypriots, another part under the British, and 
finally a fourth part under UN control. The writer concludes 
with the following: "With such unacceptable views and 
philosophies, there will be no solution to the Cyprus issue in 
the foreseeable future. And since the UN secretary general and 
the other foreigners behind him have now revealed the most 
miserable plan against Cyprus, we should make our own decisions. 
The measures by Butrus-Ghali, the British, and Americans belong 
in the trash can! The National Council should, at last, make its 
own decisions." 
  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, mouthpiece of the Democratic Party, which 
shares power with President Glavkos Kliridhis' former party, the 
Democratic Rally, comments on the secretary general's report in 
the 200-word "Freely" column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report," 
on page one. The writer says: "The first conclusion one draws 
after a careful study of the UN secretary general's report to 
the Security Council, is that we are drawn to even deeper seas 
and, at the same time, we move further away from the substance 
of the Cyprus issue and the principles of international law and 
the United Nations which should govern a just and lasting 
solution of our issue." The writer then says that the UN 
Secretariat actions are outside the norm and thus create new 
faits accomplis, and adds: "We think that we should tell 
Butrus-Ghali certain things clearly. We should register our 
disagreement in a straightforward way, and with dignity and 
credibility demand justice. Neither Butrus-Ghali nor anyone 
else should be allowed to form the impression that we are 
willing to be brought back and forth and be dragged into 
arrangements that do not take into account the justice of our 
case." 
  KHARAVYI, mouthpiece of communist party AKEL [Restorative 
Party of the Working People] comments on the report in a 
150-word column entitled "The Butrus-Ghali Report," under the 
general banner "Aggressively" on page five. The writer says: 
"The UN secretary general's first report on the proximity talks 
for the confidence-building measures has brought confusion to 
the government, which has avoided commenting on it. The ideas 
for promotion of the proximity talks appear to be based on the 
UN experts' reports [on implementation of the 
confidence-building measures] which the government did not want 
to accept at the negotiating table. Naturally, with the 
Butrus-Ghali report it is evident that the fenced area of 
Famagusta and Nicosia Airport will be under UN administration. 
This means that beyond the occupation and sovereignty of the 
British bases, we will now have the sovereignty of the United 
Nations, albeit temporary, in two parts of our homeland. Of 
course, the danger of indirect recognition of the pseudostate is 
present, since we also have the demand to allow the Turkish 
Cypriots to travel freely abroad." The writer says that it 
appears rather difficult for President Kliridhis to be able to 
overturn the developments, as the secretary general's report is 
very strict, and concludes: "The government reaps what it has 
sown." 
  Independent O AGON carries a 450-word comment in the 
"Opinion" column by the "Observer" on page three, entitled "The 
Republic of Cyprus Is Being Abolished." The writer beings by 
asking: "Why are we shocked and surprised by the contents and 
approach of the UN secretary general regarding the way the 
confidence-building measures will be implemented and by the 
status that will result from the implementation of the relevant 
arrangements? Butrus-Ghali has said nothing more upsetting than 
what was `pictured' in his documents for the confidence-building 
measures. He also does not present any other reality than what 
was expressed by the UN experts in their reports." The writer 
says that the secretary general has already told us how things 
will be, and explains: "Famagusta will be a new, worse Pyla, 
captive of the Turkish Army. Nicosia Airport will be the 
entrance to the recognition of the pseudostate. The sovereignty 
of the Republic of Cyprus will be canceled. The sovereignty of 
two administrators, one Greek Cypriot and one Turkish Cypriot, 
will take its place. Famagusta will be under double 
sovereignty, that is, Greek-Turkish sovereignty." The writer 
says the same will happen with Nicosia Airport and, "the first 
step toward abolition of the Republic of Cyprus is a fact." The 
writer argues further why the UN proposals will abolish the 
Republic of Cyprus, and concludes with the following: "We are 
only a small step from the abyss. The step will be made if we 
accept the measures."

  [Text] Police yesterday denied reports of a top alert at 
Larnaca Airport on Thursday [10 March] night in anticipation of 
the arrival of Carlos, the world's most wanted terrorist. 
  A senior police officer described as untrue reports issued 
earlier in the day that the Latin American terrorist, also known 
as "the Jackal," had been expected to stop over at the airport 
en route to Europe. 
  The reports said Carlos was believed to be on a flight from 
either Damascus or Cairo. Dozens of policemen and members of 
the antiterrorist squad had reportedly taken up positions in the 
airport. Policewomen were also allegedly assigned to check each 
passenger on flights from Cairo and Tel Aviv. 
  It had also been alleged that Thursday's bomb hoax 
concerning 
an Austrian airlines flight carrying U.S. Special Coordinator 
Robert Lamb was intended to divert police in the event of 
Carlos' arrival.

  [Text] The arms and explosives that were discovered in 
Paphos [on 13 March] may belong to an international gang that is 
selling arms to terrorist organizations. Police are 
investigating this possibility and whether the arms are a 
sampling of a larger quantity that is hidden in other areas. 
The arms were discovered during an investigation into the 
smuggling of stolen luxury cars from abroad to Cyprus. 
  Two military rifles, a rifle with a telescopic lens and a 
silencer, nine guns and revolvers of various calibers, 23 bullet 
cases, and two silencers were discovered.

  [Text] Commenting on the entry of about 70 railway wagons 
with oil into Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM], government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said 
that this was not a political gesture. He noted: This action 
is not linked politically with the Papoulias-Vance meeting; the 
wagons were in Greek territory before 16 February. 
  Responding to a question, Mr. Venizelos said that this was 
not a relaxation of the Greek measures and noted it is a matter 
of 4,500 tons of oil, which is only sufficient for the Skopje 
refinery's operation for half a day.

  [Excerpts] Greece yesterday hailed the 10 March meeting 
between UN mediator Cyrus Vance and Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias in Geneva as a positive step toward restarting the 
dialogue between Athens and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia--FYROM]. [passage omitted] 
  Encouraging signs that the Skopje dispute was slowly heading 
toward a settlement also came from Paris, where EU Commission 
President Jacques Delors offered his own "gesture of goodwill." 
Describing Mr. Vance's mediation talks in Geneva as "very 
good," Mr. Delors said: "I intend to wait for a while, and 
delay initiating injunction proceedings against Greece for its 
economic measures. Athens should take this as a gesture of 
goodwill and understanding on my part." Mr. Delors acknowledged 
"the political side of the problem since Greece invokes reasons 
of internal security."

<F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "Disastrous Mistake"] </F>
  [Text] It would be a disastrous mistake by the 
international community to decide to dispatch Turkish troops as 
Blue Helmets [UN forces] to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Enough mistakes have been committed thus far, the primary 
mistake being the breakup of Yugoslavia. Europeans played a 
pioneering role in this breakup, which opened the road to 
bloodshed and the current deadlocks. 
  It would be a disastrous mistake, because in no case should 
any other Balkan country become involved in the Balkan crisis 
and, moreover, a country which had a historic involvement and 
expansionist designs. 
  It is obvious that Turkey does not seek a peacemaking role 
in 
the Yugoslav crisis. It seeks to be present and exert influence 
in the former provinces that were enslaved by the Ottoman Empire. 
  Therefore, it would be a provocation for all the Balkan 
peoples if their former oppressor returned allegedly as 
peacemaker. 
  Turkey is seeking a role in the Balkans and without any 
loss, 
as is always the case. It seeks this role at a time when the 
Turkish economy is threatened with a collapse since all its 
exchange reserves have been exhausted. In addition, Turkey is 
also facing a lot of internal problems with open fronts in the 
Kurdish areas. 
  The United Nations and, above all, the European Union cannot 
ignore the elements of the Yugoslav crisis and throw oil on the 
Bosnian fire when the danger of a more general conflagration is 
obvious. 
  It is precisely because of this danger that there is an 
unwillingness by many countries to send the Blue Helmets to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. In spite of this, there is an offer 
sufficient to cover the needs by countries that have no 
connection with the Balkans. 
  Greece ought to persist firmly on its stance and prevent by 
all means the dispatch of Turkish or other troops from any 
Balkan country. 
  Lack of forethought by the international community could 
turn 
back the clock of history and cause a conflagration with 
unpredictable consequences. 
  So, they must study history and the peculiarity of the 
Balkan 
region before making any offhand decision. They have done 
enough that is not to their credit regarding the bloodshed and 
deadlocks in the former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
said that there is a threat from Turkey and that the decision 
for a unified defense area with Cyprus is a natural development 
since Greece is a guarantor power on the island and is 
responsible for its defense. Mr. Arsenis will arrive in Cyprus 
on Wednesday [16 March] for talks with the Cyprus Government. 
Our correspondent Andreas Stilianou has the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Stilianou] In a statement to a current 
affairs program on Athens ET-1 Television Network, Mr. Arsenis 
pointed out that Greece's role as a guarantor power in Cyprus 
gives it direct responsibility for the island's defense. Mr. 
Arsenis reiterated that any intensification of the Turkish 
threat in Cyprus would be a casus belli for Greece, and added: 
  [Arsenis] When you have two Hellenic countries--Greece and 
Cyprus--which believe, and they are right, that there is a 
common threat against them, Turkish expansionism, it follows 
that these two countries should coordinate their national 
defense plans. The unified defense area....[sentence unfinished 
as received] 
  [Stilianou] Mr. Arsenis further noted that a unified defense 
area means that Greece and Cyprus are discussing their defense 
and coordinating their plans so that they can be more efficient. 
Responding to a question, Mr. Arsenis said that he did not get 
the impression that there were reservations about the joint 
Greek-Cypriot decisions. He said: Many countries questioned 
the move and it was necessary for us to clarify our goal. Mr. 
Arsenis concluded: 
  [Arsenis] From the moment it becomes crystal clear that as 
far as we are concerned the issue is coordination of defensive 
plans to deter a common threat, then the matter has been 
explained sufficiently. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that the 
resolution adopted by the European Parliament [EP] regarding the 
lifting of certain deputies' immunities is unacceptable adding 
that the reason for it is lack of information. 
  Answering reporters' questions in Eskisehir, Cetin pointed 
out that there is a wish to politicize the issue and take it 
outside its limits. Indicating that similar decisions have been 
taken in numerous countries, Cetin gave the lifting of four 
German deputies' immunities for holding an illegal demonstration 
as an example. 
  In answer to a question, Cetin stated that Turkey does not 
make concessions, the government being a government which cannot 
be coerced.

<F P=106> [Report by Hakan Akpinar and Kadir Ercan: "They Went To </F>
Appeal to Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] Ankara--The Democracy Party [DEP] has launched a 
diplomatic initiative in Europe after six of its deputies, 
including party leader Hatip Dicle, were placed in custody. 
Sedat Yurtdas and Mehdi Zana, DEP deputies from Diyarbakir, 
left Turkey for France for that purpose yesterday. They will 
appeal to the international organizations, including the Human 
Rights Court [as published], to launch initiatives to have the 
detained deputies released and their legislative immunity 
returned. 
  It has been ascertained that the French Government has been 
informed on Yurtdas' and Zana's visit to Europe to appeal to 
President Mitterrand and Mrs. Mitterrand to take action to 
support them. 
  The officials will begin to interrogate Hatip Dicle, Orhan 
Dogan, Ahmet Turk, Leyla Zana, Sirri Sakik, and Mahmut Alinak 
today. Dicle and Dogan have been in custody for six days and 
Turk, Zana, Sakik, and Alinak have been held in custody for five 
days. They will be interrogated by a group of officials under 
Nusret Demirel, chief prosecutor of the State Security Court. 
The group is made up of Major Ulku Coskun, Kemal Ayhan, and 
Talat Salk, who are prosecutors affiliated with the State 
Security Court. The deputies will be isolated in separate rooms 
during the interrogation. 
  Meanwhile, an anonymous person called the Directorate 
General 
of Police on behalf of the Kurdish Workers Party yesterday and 
warned that the PKK will assassinate several officials if the 
deputies are not released from custody. A special operations 
team armed with M-16 automatic rifles was instructed to guard 
the building that houses the antiterror department after the 
call was received. The DEP deputies are being held in that 
department.

  [Text] A foreign tanker and a foreign freighter collided 
at the Black Sea entrance of the Istanbul Strait. Fires erupted 
on both ships as a result of the collision. The fire on the 
freighter is under control, but the fire on the tanker loaded 
with fuel continues. Two persons were killed in the accident, 
29 were wounded, and 23 crew members from both ships are missing. 
  Our correspondents have learned that the Greek Cypriot 
tanker 
(Nafia), which was entering the strait from the Black Sea, 
collided with (Sharprock), a freighter sailing toward the Black 
Sea, at around 2230 last night. Fires erupted on both ships as 
a result of the collision. The freighter, in flames, ran 
aground at Anadolu Kavagi. The fire was gotten under control 
early this morning. The tanker, also in flames, sailed on out 
of control for a while. The tanker had loaded 50,567 tonnes of 
fuel in Russia and was on its way to Italy. It hit rocks in the 
Cakar region near Rumeli Kavagi and ran aground. The tanker is 
250 meters long and weighs 66,820 tonnes. The fire continues to 
rage and explosions are occurring. 
  Fire fighters from the Port Authority and from the Istanbul 
Fire Brigade are at work. Two fire-extinguishing ships have 
sailed from an Izmit refinery to help with the efforts to put 
out the fire. 
  State Minister Yildirim Aktuna, Istanbul Governor Hayri 
Kozakcioglu, and Istanbul Mayor Nurettin Sozen went to the site 
of the incident. Kozakcioglu said that the fire does not pose a 
threat to the residents in the area. He noted, however, that 
the fire will continue for some time. The governor said that 
there were 30 crew members aboard the (Nafia). Of them, 23 were 
wounded, one was killed, and six are missing. There were 24 
crew members on the freighter, of whom one was killed, six were 
wounded, and 17 are missing. The governor said that there are 
reports of bodies on the freighter, but they have not been 
reached yet. 
  State Minister Aktuna said that efforts are being made to 
ensure that the tanker remains where it is. ANATOLIA reports 
that Aktuna said that the (Nafia) has 10 oil tanks and that 
three of them are empty and three are burning. We are cooling 
the four other tanks, he said, to prevent them from burning, 
too. He explained that measures have been taken to prevent the 
burning tanker from being dragged toward the Bosphorus by the 
wind. He stressed that residents in the area need not worry and 
that every necessary measure has been taken. 
  Minister of Environmental Affairs Riza Akcali said that the 
incident proves once again how Turkey is right when it says that 
transporting fuel through the straits has risks and might be 
very dangerous for Turkey. In a statement to Turkish Radio and 
Television, Akcali stressed that the international agreement on 
the traffic through the straits must be reassessed in accordance 
with present conditions. Akcali went to Istanbul to check the 
site of the incident. 
  State Minister Ibrahim Tez said that after the accident, the 
relevant crisis centers have been activated and that the 
Istanbul Strait has been closed to maritime traffic. He pointed 
out that barriers have been sent to the area to prevent the 
spread of oil leaking from the tanker. He noted that there were 
no traffic guides on either of the ships. He also said that 
even though there is no danger of a big explosion on the tanker, 
the ships at the Kavak Pilot Station, in Altinkum, and in 
Buyukdere Bay have been evacuated as a precaution. 
  [Nicosia Bayrak Radio in Turkish at 0600 GMT on 14 March 
reports that the freighter (Sharprock) is Greek and that at 
least eight persons are dead, 18 are missing, and 23 are 
injured.]

that it is out of the question to ever sit at the negotiating 
table with these persons. 
  Ciller visited the children's hostel of the Child Protection 
Association in Istanbul's Kasimpasa quarter this afternoon. She 
exchanged holiday greetings and distributed gifts. In reply to 
a question, Ciller said: The terrorists cannot be our equals. 
We cannot consider them our equals. We, therefore, cannot sit 
at the negotiating table with them. The important issue is to 
ensure the security of life and property of our citizens in that 
region. We are able to celebrate the holidays in security 
throughout Turkey today. We will hold the elections in a 
similar atmosphere. Had these terrorists not existed we would 
have reached this point much earlier. The important issue now 
is for them to give up. The state is powerful. The Turkish 
state is very powerful. We are very determined.

sticks, electronic equipment used in manufacturing explosive 
devices, clothing ready to be sent out to the rural regions, and

Mentese] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has stated that 461 
terrorists have been killed and 2,189 captured during the 
security forces' operations since the beginning of the year, 
among them 365 who were killed and 1,271 who were captured in 
the state of emergency region. 
  Mentese noted that the terrorists and their supporters were 
in a panic as a result of not being able to resist the security 
forces as well as from suffering great losses. Mentese further 
stated that the terrorists are trying to solve their 
difficulties, which result from failure and the lack of support 
they receive from the people, by undertaking efforts to 
cooperate with foreigners. Mentese indicated that these 
developments are clear proof that certain foreign circles are 
using the terrorists as their tools. 
  Stating that it is unfortunate that there are parties and 
persons who boycott the regional elections in spite of the 
safety in the country established by the great sacrifices of the 
security forces, Mentese said that the political parties' duty 
of participating in the elections is a fundamental principle of 
democracy, adding that the people who avoid this duty will 
receive what they deserve from the people.

  [Text] Ankara--Chief of Staff Gen. Dogan Gures has called 
for an emergency meeting of the Supreme Military Council (SMC) 
before the potentially explosive Nevroz festivities and the 
local elections. 
  The meeting is tentatively scheduled for March 18 but 
military sources told the Turkish Daily News on Tuesday [8 
March] that the date may be rescheduled by a day or two "but 
will definitely be held before March 21," the day the Nevroz 
festivities are to be held. In the past, separatist Kurdish 
terrorists have used the festivities to wreck [as published] 
havoc in southeastern Turkey. 
  The unprecedented meeting is designed to pinpoint the 
assessments of the leading Turkish generals and admirals 
regarding the Southeastern problem and to convey the military's 
views to the National Security Council (NSC), which will convene 
under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel on March 30 
after the local elections. 
  The Supreme Military Council meets twice a year according to 
the law to discuss strictly military matters. However, the 
chief of staff also has the authority to call for an emergency 
meeting of the council which is chaired by the prime minister. 
The presence of the prime minister is usually only a formality. 
The prime ministers open the military council meetings and then 
leave the generals and admirals to deliberate amongst themselves. 
  Political observers say it is meaningful that the council, 
which normally meets in December and August, is being called to 
an emergency meeting only a few days before Nevroz and about a 
week before the local elections. 
  They say this will mean the military leaders will discuss 
the 
outstanding issues and reach a consensus to be conveyed to the 
civilian authority. 
  According to the law, the military council is only charged 
with "presenting the views of the military" and handling 
promotions and retirements of officers. However, the law does 
cover a broad scope of issues on which the military can present 
its views. 
  The law says the military can do the following: disclose its 
views on the determination of military strategical concepts to 
be developed by the general staff and the reassessment of these 
concepts; to disclose its views on the main programs and targets 
of the military; to comment on the laws, statutes and 
regulations concerning military matters; and to air its views on 
various military issues seen fit by the minister of defense, the 
chief of staff and the prime minister. 
  The law does not mention "internal security" as an issue to 
be discussed by the military council, yet as the Army is charged 
with handling security matters in southeastern Turkey, this 
situation entitles the military to discuss the problem within 
the context of the "military strategic concept," according to 
observers. 
  Besides the prime minister and the chief of staff, the 
members of the military council include the defense minister, 
the commanders of the Land, Navy and Air forces, the Gendarmerie 
commander, the commanders of the First, Second, Third and Aegean 
armies, the commander of the fleet, the commander of the war 
academies, the commander of the NATO Southeastern Allied Land 
Forces, the secretary-general of the National Security Council 
and, last but not least the second chief of staff. As most of 
the leading commanders cannot participate in the National 
Security Council meetings they can air their views on the 
"protection of the integrity of the state, of the unity of the 
country and measures to preserve calm and tranquility in Turkey" 
at the military council meeting. 
  Under normal circumstances the military council cannot 
discuss security issues regarding the nationwide local 
elections, yet as the military units are charged with restoring 
law and order in southeastern Turkey along with police forces, 
the commanders can discuss this issue as it is allowed to debate 
all issues that concern the military. 
  It is known that the military wants the government to 
legislate a new wide-ranging anti-terrorism bill and is 
disturbed with the delays. The military council which can voice 
its views on laws concerning the military may officially convey 
its concern to the civilian authority on the delays regarding 
the anti-terrorism law. 
  There is also talk that the military council may discuss the 
need for the proclamation of martial law in the troubled 
southeastern provinces, especially in view of the expected 
violence during the Nevroz celebrations. If a majority of the 
generals and admirals press for martial law, the council may 
convey such a request to the Supreme Military Council meeting at 
the end of the month soon after the local elections. Martial 
law can be proclaimed by a request from the Supreme Military 
Council. 
  The Cabinet then convenes under the chairmanship of the 
president and proclaim martial law for a period not to exceed 
six months.

  [Text] A French soldier was killed this morning in the 
Bihac area, in the western part of Bosnia. It is still not 
known who fired the shot. This is the 19th French soldier 
killed in former Yugoslavia. Francois Leotard heard the news 
while in Israel and the defense minister expressed his anger to 
Pierre Veil: 
  [Begin Leotard recording] As you can understand, my reaction 
is one of great sadness and anger. France is making sacrifices 
for peace. The soldiers who are targeted in this cowardly way 
are soldiers of peace. They are there to accomplish 
humanitarian missions. They escort food supplies and protect 
civilian populations. They are Blue Helmets, therefore they are 
not engaged in a war situation. War is often waged on them in a 
cowardly way. I express with great vigor my indignation at this 
kind of behavior. I hope that our mission there is understood 
despite all the difficulties encountered. Despite these 
victims, our mission is to bring peace to a war-torn region, 
which could pose a threat in the future. The French people 
should be aware of this. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by announcer </F>
Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the studio -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Giesbert] Edouard Balladur 
announced yesterday in Bosnia that [Defense Minister] Francois 
Leotard and you will make proposals to render air response 
effective. What does that mean? 
  [Juppe] It means that the situation today is not 
satisfactory. Both the legal apparatus -- that is the UN 
Security Council resolutions -- and the operational apparatus -- 
that is NATO forces, planes in particular -- are ready. 
  [Giesbert] The problem is timing, then, the 60-minute gap, 
more or less, between the moment when the decision to respond is 
made and the moment when it is actually put into effect. 
  [Juppe] Yes it is, maybe a little bit more than that. Timing 
is one problem but the desire is another. It seems that those 
in charge on the ground, who represent the UN secretary general, 
are not ready to use force whenever necessary. But it is 
necessary. In spite of last month's developments in the war in 
the former Yugoslavia, things are still very confused on the 
ground and dangerous -- as we unfortunately saw in the case of 
the 19th French soldier to be killed. The task we are carrying 
out there, in the former Yugoslavia. [sentence as heard] We 
must be faster and we must be more determined to use force 
whenever it is necessary. 
  [Giesbert] Today the initiative you have taken with regard 
to 
the former Yugoslavia has not really been very successful. Are 
you not a little frustrated? It seems that all this will 
eventually end up with a Serb victory. They control 70 percent 
of the land and they will return only what they want to return. 
  [Juppe] This is absolutely untrue. All the peace plans which 
have been prepared -- including the efforts we are making now -- 
have stipulated that the Serbs will have to withdraw and will be 
able to occupy 49 percent of the territory at most. This is 
what was said in the European Union plan. Why should I be 
frustrated? As I told you, we were at a turning point one month 
ago. Sarajevo is now coming back to life. Croats and Muslims 
are holding talks and making progress. It is true that in some 
places, in Bihac in particular, tension is still running high. 
This is why we should have two goals: We should be much 
stricter and much faster. I do not want to repeat what I think 
of the use of force. Second, I think we should try to stick the 
pieces of the diplomatic process together. Today, negotiations 
are being held in many places. We should all sit around a table 
again: Russians, Americans, and Europeans. If the three parties 
involved refuse to sit at that table, we will not really have a 
global solution. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, March 14 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe Monday [14 March] slammed the United Nations saying 
it lacked the "determination" to use force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "I don't have the feeling that officials on the ground -- 
those who represent the UN secretary general -- are firmly 
committed to resorting to force everytime it's necessary," Juppe 
said on Europe 1 radio. 
  "One must act faster and be more determined," he said, 
referring to this weekend's failure by North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation warplanes to retaliate against Serb forces in the 
western Bihac region, despite calls for strikes by French 
peacekeepers. 
  One French peacekeeper was killed in the Bihac pocket last 
week. 
  French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who visited Bihac on 
Sunday, strongly criticized "the often overly long delays, (and) 
the too heavy administrative and political procedures" 
preventing immediate retaliation when blue helmets come under 
fire. 
  He had earlier spoken of his concern to the UN's special 
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. 
  Juppe, for his part, said that "Americans, Russians and 
Europeans had to convene again around a table," failing which 
there could be no global solution to the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Interview with correspondent Bernard Volker by announcer </F>
Claire Chazal--recorded] 
  [Text] [Chazal] On 18 February, we told you that the 
Sarajevo market massacre, in which 68 people were killed on 5 
January, had been provoked by a shell fired from Bosnian 
Government lines. Correspondent Bernard Volker at the time gave 
us details of an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] report, and said 
that Lord Owen, co-chairman of the peace conference on former 
Yugoslavia, had sent letters informing European foreign 
ministers of the results of this enquiry. We can now show you 
this confidential letter. This text confirms what we told you on 
18 February. At the time, our report had been denied by the 
United Nations. 
  [Volker] Let us first look at the text that I saw and which 
we have filmed for you: Lord Owen, former British foreign 
minister, represents Europe at the conference on former 
Yugoslavia, which he chairs together with Mr. Stoltenberg, the 
UN representative. On the evening of 12 February, Lord Owen 
sent European foreign ministers copies of the confidential 
report. 
  We have obtained access to the report. Here is paragraph 7, 
which addresses the question of the 5 February Sarajevo attack. 
Lord Owen says, I quote: 7. The Serbs, it appears, will not 
give up their claim to part of Sarajevo. I fear the Serbs are 
ready to sit tight and wait to see what happens in Sarajevo. 
The Serbs expect the UN ballistic experts to confirm the story 
about leaked UNPROFOR documents carried in TANJUG (datelined 
Sarajevo, 8 February) about the shell that provoked the tragedy 
in Sarajevo's open market. The spot from where it was fired 
is some 1 to 1.5 kilometers inside the territory under Muslim 
control, measured from the demarcation line with the RS 
[Republika Srpska] army positions. This fact was confirmed 
tonight for TANJUG by highly reliable and confidential sources 
within UNPROFOR's HQ who wished to remain anonymous, and it was 
also stated in the report by UNPROFOR's commission of experts 
that conducted an investigation. The report was sent this 
morning to the UN HQ in New York. 
  [Chazal] This confirms the information we had earlier given, 
even though it had not at the time been confirmed by the United 
Nations. 
  [Volker] According to this text sent by Lord Owen, which you 
have just seen, the report outlining the conclusions of 
UNPROFOR's inquiry was sent on the morning of 12 February to UN 
headquarters, therefore to Mr. Butrus-Ghali. That was two days 
after NATO had issued its ultimatum to the Serbs to force them 
to lift the siege of Sarajevo. It was a truth that was rather 
inconvenient at the time. The international community, Europe, 
had for the first time managed to come to a real, firm decision 
in Yugoslavia, and lifting the siege of Sarajevo was a priority. 
That meant that our report had to be denied. The official UN 
version was that it was impossible to say with certainty where 
the shell had been fired from. 
  [Chazal] Can we be sure of the authenticity of this 
document? 
  [Volker] I am certain of it. I had it in my hands just now. 
I myself photocopied paragraph 7, which you saw a moment ago. 
I noted the identification codes, which show with certainty 
that this is a confidential document reserved for foreign 
ministers. 
  [Chazal] Can you tell us who gave you this document? 
  [Volker] You know, since 18 February, this report was 
confirmed to us, to you Claire, to me, to other journalists from 
TF1, both in France and abroad, by several leading figures who 
are in a position to be very well-informed. They asked to 
remain anonymous. We will therefore not reveal their 
identities. The truth is in fact often neither pleasant nor 
convenient. I think that we nevertheless have a duty to say 
what we know, having thoroughly checked the reliability of our 
sources, and while maintaining professional confidentiality.

against the Mafia. French and Italian judges are meeting near 
Aix-en-Provence today to assess the infiltration of the Mafia in 
the southeast of France. More details from Michelle Fine and 
Pascal Pons: 
  [Fine] Even though his report stimulated the measures 
announced by the justice minister, Judge Thierry Jean-Pierre was 
the only absentee from this meeting of 30 or so French and 
Italian judges, where the minister announced these three 
measures to toughen the fight against the Mafia. 
  [Begin Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie recording] 
Organized crime does not respect borders, therefore justice will 
not stop at borders. This is why the three decisions following 
the contacts we intend to establish in coming weeks are, first, 
to set up a central intelligence network to support -- this is 
the second decision -- special courts to deal with all forms of 
organized crime. The third issue, stressed by our Italian 
friends, is that organized crime is not only made up of obvious 
violent actions, but also of moneylaundering, of entering French 
territory to seek refuge from Italian justice. In the coming 
weeks, we will adopt additional laws to combat all forms of 
money laundering. [end recording] 
  [Fine] Many more meetings between French and Italian judges 
and several months' work will be needed before the measures 
announced this evening can be implemented.

<F P=106> [Report signed "P.C." on interview with Congolese President </F>
Pascal Lissouba in Paris: "French Employers Have a Card To 
Play"] 
  [Text] Since last Monday [7 March], Congolese President 
Pascal Lissouba has been on a private visit to Paris, during 
which he has already met with President Francois Mitterrand, 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, and officials from the CNPF 
[National Council of French Employers]. The visit is primarily 
a political one, following the devaluation of the CFA franc. 
  In an interview given to LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, the 
Congolese 
president wondered: "Who asked for the CFA to be devalued? 
That was one of the conditions that had long been demanded by 
the World Bank. I do not wish to get emotional. The 
devaluation is a fact. I do not wish to manage the negative 
aspects of this decision; this is an opportunity that I want to 
seize. First, at the regional level, we must reinforce economic 
and monetary integration. Next Monday, I will be in N'Djamena 
in the company of other central African heads of state to debate 
the prospects of an economic and monetary community." 
  Pascal Lissouba affirmed that after the devaluation of the 
CFA franc, Congo and France found themselves confronted with 
three types of problem: "First, the problem of the French 
private sector which, if not supported, will face disaster. 
Second, the problem of the social aspects which the structural 
adjustment programs have always underestimated. France has made 
proposals for aid to the program. The implementation of these 
programs has yet to be determined. And third, investments in 
the future will cost two or three times more than they do now, 
and I do not have any funds for supporting investment." 
  Referring to his meeting with the leaders of the CNPF, the 
Congolese president said that "French employers have a card to 
play because they have experience in Africa. They have friends 
in Africa, and they definitely have business to do, provided 
that a minimum level of justice is respected. France itself 
also has interests. French banks in Africa are suffering from 
the lack of liquidity. For more than a century, we have had 
links with France. We are blithely eliminating them out without 
really realizing that we are sucking out the core too." 
  What is the purpose of Pascal Lissouba's visit to Paris? "I 
did not come here to try and get myself liked, but to get myself 
understood," he affirmed, "to explain our difficulties, our 
limitations, and our expectations." Congo, which is facing a 
foreign debt of some 15 billion French francs (more than 70 
percent of which is owed to France as government debt and trade 
debt), has experienced social and political unrest in recent 
months. The country has what the IMF and World Bank feel is an 
exorbitant number of civil servants. "Human dignity lies in 
work, not unemployment. Should the choice be to die of hunger or 
die from a bullet? The people who participate in riots do not 
ask themselves that kind of question," the Congolese president 
explained.

  [Text] Paris, March 12 (AFP) -- Tens of thousands of youths 
marched through Paris on Saturday [12 March] to demand that the 
government drop plans to cut the minimum legal wage for young 
people. 
  The demonstration was the second in three days as pressure 
mounted on the conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur. 
  Saturday's march was called by the communist-lead CGT 
[General Labor Confederation] trade union. Taking part were CGT 
Secretary General Louis Viannet and Communist Party National 
Secretary Robert Hue. 
  But student unions, a teachers' union and antiracist 
organisations joined in as the Left appeared to unite against 
the government. 
  A large police contingent monitored the march to prevent a 
repeat of violence that marred a student demonstration Thursday, 
when gangs of hooded youths burned cars and looted posh stores 
in the Montparnasse area on the city's Left Bank. 
  In Saturday's march on the other side of the Seine River, 
CGT 
guards clashed with splinter groups and drove them off. 
  Another big demonstration has been called for Thursday by 
students, the independent trade union Force Ouvriere and the 
pro-socialist labor union CFDT [French Democratic Confederation 
of Labor]. On Saturday, Viannet anounced that the CGT would 
take part in that rally. 
  On Saturday, demonstrators also turned out in six provincial 
capitals, at Marseille and Toulouse and in Bastia on the 
Mediterranean island of Corsica in the south, at Lyon and Metz 
in the east and at Nantes in the west. 
  More than 25,000 marched in Toulouse, 25,000 in Nantes and 
in 
Lyon the turnout was estimated at more than 10,000. 
  The marchers demanded that the government withdraw its youth 
employment measures altogether, although Balladur has 
considerably watered them down. 
  Initially the government planned to allow firms to recruit 
youths at less than the minimum take-home pay of 880 dollars a 
month, whatever their qualifications, in an attempt to whittle 
away at France's record unemployment. 
  But it backed down in negotiations with the trade unions, 
saying holders of university degrees or technical diplomas would 
be guaranteed the minimum wage provided arrangements were made 
to train them. 
  With French unemployment at 3.3 million or 12.2 percent, 
employers and conservatives say the minimum wage is excessive 
and a major structural impediment to job creation. 
  Students and unions had charged that the Balladur proposals 
would allow employers to simply replace existing workers with 
more educated youths at lower wages.

  [Text] Paris, March 12 (AFP) -- Conservative Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur's popularity has further slipped ahead of key 
local elections next weekend, according to the latest opinion 
poll. 
  The decline comes as the approval rating of President 
Francois Mitterrand, Balladur's socialist rival, is rising. 
  A poll for the JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE newspaper, to be 
published 
Sunday [13 March], said 45 percent of voters expressed support 
for Balladur, down from 47 percent in February. Forty-seven 
percent said they were dissatisfied, up from 43 percent last 
month. 
  For Mitterrand, 44 percent said they approved of his 
performance, up from 41 percent in February. However, 48 
percent of voters expressed dissatisfaction with the president, 
down from 50 percent. 
  The telephone poll was conducted between March 3-11 among a 
sample of 1,888 registered voters. 
  It comes ahead of the 20 and 27 March local elections which 
will test the popularity of Balladur's conservative coalition 
government. 
  Balladur, who enjoyed a long honeymoon in public opinion for 
his presidential style as prime minister, has recently suffered 
a sharp fall in popularity. It comes in the wake of 
demonstrations by fishermen angry over cheap imports and young 
people protesting a government proposal to let businesses hire 
them for less than the minimum wage as a way to fight France's 
nagging unemployment problem.

  [Text] The trade unions and parties of the Left are back in 
business. This is good news for the quality of democratic 
debate. A country with no opposition is like a person suffering 
from partial paralysis. But you have to be pretty cynical to 
tap into the despair of the country's youth in this way after 
having failed to respond to their questions and their needs 
during 10 years in power. 
  The 813,000 unemployed young people between the ages of 18 
and 24 -- including 80,000 with qualifications of no use in the 
labor market -- have good reason to blame their elders, and most 
certainly the government of the day. However, it is primarily 
due to the Socialists that they are so numerous, because it was 
the Left which allowed state education to fall into its present 
sorry state. The tens of thousands who took to the streets on 
Saturday had picked the wrong target in denouncing the first 
government which has made any attempt to tackle the difficult 
problem of youth unemployment. 
  The government would, however, be making a serious mistake 
if 
it did nothing but denounce its predecessors. It is in power 
today precisely because the country sought to punish the 
Socialists. Now, one year later, it is perfectly reasonable to 
demand an explanation from those who govern. The criticism from 
the opposition is perfectly valid, but the Majority has the 
means to defend itself provided it does not indulge in internal 
quarrels. The matter of the CIP [Youth Vocational Training 
Contract] has shown that solidarity within government ranks was 
fragile to say the least. 
  The problems of the government seem to be providing fuel for 
the prime minister's rivals. The same mistakes are being 
repeated which, on two occasions already, have resulted in the 
defeat of the parliamentary Right. The leaders of the RPR 
[Rally for the Republic] and the UDF [Union for French 
Democracy] seem to be concerned only with fighting Balladur. 
Votes in Parliament and claims of solidarity -- when openly 
discovered trying to trip up their colleagues -- change nothing. 
The voters have quite clearly understood that the battle for 
the crown is being waged once again. The refusal to clearly 
support Matignon [prime minister's office] on the CIP issue 
shows the ulterior motives of the politicians. 
  This attitude is suicidal in two respects. On the one hand, 
the credibility of potential presidential candidates of the 
Right would not benefit from the declining popularity of the 
prime minister (who remains the best-placed candidate for the 
Elysee [presidential office). The government would also be very 
mistaken to believe that it is assured of victory in 1995. The 
Socialists will no doubt not do very well in the European 
elections. But too damaging a failure for Rocard -- openly 
desired, and perhaps soon to be organized by a section of the 
Left, and by the Elysee -- could result in him dropping out of 
the presidential race to Jacques Delors' benefit. This would 
greatly complicate the job of the candidates of the Right.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Chinese-American Test of </F>
Strength"] 
  [Text] The arrival in Beijing on Friday, 11 March, of U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was the opportunity for a 
serious test of strength between the United States and China. 
The authorities of the Communist regime immediately indicated 
to Washington's diplomatic chief that he had no right to meddle 
with the affairs of the host country. 
  In order to make things quite clear, shortly before Mr. 
Christopher's arrival, the Shanghai police briefly detained Wang 
Fuchen, the secretary of the human rights association of the 
southern capital. 
  The difference of agreement is nothing new: Beijing has 
always acted as leader of those -- mainly Asian -- countries 
which more or less support the view that the subject of human 
rights is only used by the West as a means of exerting pressure, 
mainly for commercial ends. The debate was revived by the 
possibility of an imminent reconsideration by Washington of 
Beijing's attribution with most-favored-nation status. 
Recently, President Clinton gave his Chinese partner until June 
to demonstrate good will regarding human rights. 
  The novel aspect now is that this time China risks 
humiliating the world's leading power for which it has generally 
reserved more circumspect treatment than for many other Western 
countries. Why? Without a doubt it feels emboldened by the 
points it has just scored against France, which was forced to 
call off its sale of aircraft to Taiwan, and against Great 
Britain, which was duly informed that the reforms implemented by 
Hong Kong Governor Patten will be repealed on the same day that 
the colony returns to the fold. 
  Perhaps, above all, Beijing's attitude is symptomatic of the 
form of government practiced by the high-ranking officials in 
the run-up to the probable upheaval that will follow the death 
of the patriarch Deng Xiaoping: Nothing must happen that calls 
their absolute authority into question. Even the respectful 
mode of dissent chosen by the dissidents, who sweep aside any 
hypothetical removal of the regime, is not convincing the old 
guard to accept the dialogue which questions their system of 
order. 
  The Chinese leaders believe they can adopt the same attitude 
in the international context. Deep down, they believe that 
President Clinton, following the others, will ultimately 
consider it more pressing to uphold the capitalist interests of 
his country than to echo what they take to be pure 
sentimentality on the part of both intellectuals and 
humanitarian organizations, relayed by an influential 
international press. 
  Consequently, the visit by Mr. Christopher would appear to 
be 
crucial. In fact, it will enable the Chinese to gauge U.S. 
determination, and inevitably it will serve as a barometer for 
other visitors, starting with Edouard Balladur, who is expected 
in Beijing on 7 April.

  [Text] The Balladur government has suffered setbacks. In 
some cases it is not to blame, and in other cases it is to 
blame. The Majority is reprehensible when it stresses these 
failings. The Left, however, would be clumsy not to seize on 
them. However, politics is not simply a question of adroitness, 
or at least adroitness has its limits. Let us consider the 
example of youth and the unemployment crisis. It is quite 
legitimate for [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard 
-- even if he was unable to convince youth and could not solve 
the unemployment problem, and even if, being who he is, he has 
resorted to using vulgar arguments -- to criticize [Prime 
Minister] Balladur's policies. It is not acceptable, however, 
for him to draw fire and bitterness, and feed the flames of 
anger with his insidious remarks that combine the problems of 
secularity, unemployment, and the supposed censuring of freedom 
of expression. Everything precludes these actions: the nature 
of his responsibilities, his failures, and good will. 
  Let us take another example, that of civil liberty. When 
Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand sensationally condemns the attacks on 
civil liberties by the current government, clearly accusing 
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, although not naming him 
directly, of endangering democracy, she is parodying reality, 
overstepping her duties, and insulting her adversaries. France 
is clearly not a land of oppression. Mrs. Mitterrand does not 
occupy the post of judge, and the Majority has passed the laws 
that she is questioning. 
  The similarity between these references is no coincidence. 
Naturally, it is hardly likely that the wife of the president of 
the Republic and the first secretary of the PS planned together 
to heap opprobrium on the Balladur government. However, it is 
not merely by chance that they seized on the same opportunities 
to fight the same battle with the same arguments on the same 
ground and with the same political objective. There is a common 
thread behind the cause they are defending. This thread is the 
disarray of youth. There are no holds barred in feeding this 
disarray, irrespective of the excesses and the harm that this 
could result in. It is the government's weak point. It is thus 
this weakness that they are attacking, with even the most 
trivial of weapons. Let us agitate the most malleable of 
armies, those people who are the most affected by the current 
hard times, and attack the enemy! 
  The socialist Left was looking for this kind of clientele. 
Now it has found it. The Left is faltering: The Mitterrand 
generation will give way to the Rocard generation! Since they 
cannot prepare a political and ideological takeover campaign, 
they are restoring an inexhaustible issue -- youth -- under the 
banner of an inexhaustible myth -- liberty.

to increase the number of soldiers in the conflict zone, Spain 
will send to Bosnia-Herzegovina about 200 more blue helmets, who 
will join the Spanish UN battalion next week. In all, the new 
Spanish contribution will comprise around 200 men, who will be 
joining the 1,200 Spanish blue helmets stationed in the Mostar 
area. It is expected that they will be able to travel to the 
former Yugoslavia during the course of next week. According to 
an official spokesman, a radar detection unit, which locates 
mortar and heavy weapon trajectories, will be sent. The unit 
will comprise six vehicles and 25 men, who will have the task of 
monitoring and consolidating the cease-fire in the city of 
Mostar, which is considered vital for the security of the 
population.

  [Text] The Spanish Government has given to understand that 
in Brussels on Tuesday [15 March] a fisheries agreement could be 
reached with Norway, which would permit this Nordic country's 
entry into the European Union [EU]. However, according to 
official sources quoted today, Saturday, by the Madrid daily EL 
PAIS, there is no compromise in sight on institutional 
adaptations and changes in voting. Meanwhile, the Spanish 
Government has won the support of all the political parties, 
including those of the opposition, in the joint congress-senate 
commission of the Spanish Cortes [parliament] for the position 
being upheld in Brussels in the face of its Community partners. 
  Today, the aforementioned Madrid newspaper carries an 
article 
by Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister of agriculture, 
fisheries and food, in which he reflects on the common fisheries 
policy and defends the Spanish position as regards its partners. 
Albero reiterates the point that on the subject of fisheries, 
Spain has a great interest in a country like Norway joining the 
European Union, but he stresses that this does not justify the 
abolition of the common wealth by pleading geographical 
exceptionality or greater efficiency of management of resources. 
In his article, the Spanish minister of agriculture and 
fisheries recalls that the Spanish fishing industry is the 
biggest and most complex of the whole of the European Union. He 
warns that Community enlargement must not and cannot represent a 
step backwards as regards what has hitherto been achieved.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose-Antonio Ardanza, president of the </F>
Spanish Basque Government, by Patrick Lopez in Paris; date not 
given: "Ardanza: `The Regions Want More Power in Europe'"] 
  [Text] Jose-Antonio Ardanza, the president of the Spanish 
Basque Government, is visiting Paris for the first time. He is 
demanding a role for the regions in Europe, and wants to attract 
French investors to his region. 
  [Lopez] On this first official visit you are surrounded by 
ministers and businessmen. Is it not, however, a political 
visit rather than an economic visit? 
  [Ardanza] This visit has three aims. The first is clearly 
political, the second is economic, and our third aim is to 
change the image of the Basque country. I tried to explain to 
Rene Monory, the president of the French Senate, and to French 
leaders the idea we have of our place in the Spanish state and 
in Europe. I believe that, while we are close geographically, 
the French political class does not really know us. 
  [Lopez] Are you not also trying to appear more European than 
Spanish and trying to stress your importance in a Europe of the 
regions, which is nonetheless a difficult exercise in France? 
  [Ardanza] Of course it is difficult (...). European 
construction can only be achieved by abandoning some of the 
sovereignty of the states. For the first time in its history, 
this continent... is attempting a process of peaceful 
unification. It is understandably slow (...). The dynamism 
will be born within the states by the rise of regional movements 
(...). I think that the regions deserve greater powers at the 
European level. 
  [Lopez] Are you satisfied, as a Basque, with the stance 
taken 
by Madrid on the question of fishing rights in the context of 
Norwegian entry into the European Union [EU]? 
  [Ardanza] It is normal that we should defend this sector of 
activity which is important for us. In 1986, when we joined the 
EC, we kept a low profile. Today, we have proved our respect of 
democracy and our competence, and the Spanish Government has 
been a driving force behind the European idea. Clearly, the 
countries now applying for membership have some of the highest 
incomes per inhabitant in the world and they fully intend, 
through joining, to further improve their position. By 
defending our fishing rights we want to put the brakes on the 
implementation of a two-speed Europe with a rich north and an 
increasingly poor south. 
  [Lopez] What were your plans when you came to Paris? 
  [Ardanza] What do we see on the geoeconomic level? In 
addition to the north-south divide, is there not also an 
East-West divide? Faced with development in the east, from 
London to Lyons via the channel tunnel, and in the Mediterranean 
from Genoa to Barcelona, the Atlantic fringe was going to be 
marginalized. That is the purpose of our initiatives: 
developing partnerships between the various regions of the 
countries on this fringe, in particular to avoid having to take 
a resigned attitude toward Brussels. 
  Second, France is our leading economic partner and we would 
like to allay certain fears that your country's businessmen have 
concerning the Basque country. The best recommendations come 
from companies that have already set up in our region. 
  [Lopez] Is it to further attract them that you have granted 
tax incentives? 
  [Ardanza] We have the same taxation powers as a state. In 
the delicate industrial situation our region finds itself in, I 
think it is quite normal to want to attract companies. We are 
not the only ones using this type of incentive and I do not 
think it is what people call fiscal dumping. It is also true 
that the Basque state has always historically intervened in the 
region's economy, but of course I would like the state to be as 
least interventionist as possible. However, we have to 
encourage companies to modernize by helping them financially and 
sometimes by taking stakes in them.

<F P=106> [Article signed JPH/DVA/PLS: "Claes: Cooperation Treaty </F>
Between EU and Ukraine Almost Completed"; as released by 
Brussels BELGA Database] 
  [Text] Kiev, 11 Mar (BELGA) -- On Thursday [10 March] and 
Friday in Kiev, foreign ministers of the European Troika 
[Belgium, Greece, Germany] and the European External Relations 
Commissioner Hans van den Broek prepared a cooperation agreement 
between the European Union (EU) and Ukraine for signature 
possibly on 23 March in Brussels. 
  A similar agreement between the EU and Russia is being drawn 
up but has not been completed. It appears that partnership with 
Ukraine will come first. 
  During the talks with Ukrainian political leaders (Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Chairman of Parliament Ivan 
Plyushch on Thursday and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk on 
Friday) the Troika made it clear to Ukraine that the EU is 
serious about its "Global Approach Strategy." In other words, 
technical and economic cooperation is exchanged for 
denuclearization and signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty 
[NPT]. 
  Ukraine has started dismantling the 1,800 nuclear heads on 
its territory. In exchange for this, the former Soviet republic 
will also receive financial support from the United States. 
However, cooperation with the EU goes even further than this. 
  The objective is to continue the denuclearization process in 
Ukraine. Should this process come to a halt, then European 
cooperation would also stop. 
  The European ministers in Kiev also insisted on 
normalization 
of relations with Russia and on compliance with all the 
conditions of the IMF and the World Bank -- two institutions 
that Ukrainian President Kravchuk visited last week in 
Washington. 
  The relations between Ukraine and Russia are not very good. 
In January, Kiev agreed with Moscow on the dismantling of 
nuclear warheads in exchange for enriched uranium for Ukrainian 
plants. Recently, President Kravchuk indicated that 
denuclearization is underway as agreed. He made it clear that 
dismantling of nuclear warheads would be conditional on gas 
deliveries from Moscow. This month, Moscow suspended its gas 
exports to Ukraine. 
  During a press conference following the negotiations, 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko told the international press 
that when parliamentary activities resume (after the 27 March 
elections), the Ukrainian Parliament would ratify the 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  EU Commissioner van den Broek indicated that the success of 
the cooperation agreement will "largely depend on the success of 
the economic reforms in Ukraine. If Ukraine benefits from the 
macroeconomic conditions, foreign investors will be convinced." 
  Belgian Foreign Minister Claes pointed out that the 
cooperation agreement provided for import restrictions on, among 
other things, Ukrainian steel and aluminium -- there are 70,000 
posts at stake in the European steel sector -- as well as an 
antidumping clause. "There will be rules for both partners. 
Ukraine and Europe will benefit from the treaty. The contract 
is not based on full reciprocity: Ukraine has the advantage," 
Claes added. 
  Claes said that "the priority was to establish a stable 
monetary system in Ukraine to enable foreign investments." 
  On Friday, the Ukrainian president confirmed to the troika 
that he expects to gather the requested majority (and the 
requested quorum) in Parliament to ratify the Nonproliferation 
Treaty, Claes added.

investigation team. What is your reply to that? 
  [Borrelli] We are quite happy. Rather, I do not know how to 
interpret this excessive agitation on Mr. Berlusconi's part. It 
may lend itself to several interpretations, not all of them 
consistent with an entirely calm conscience on the part of the 
agitated person. I repeat, we are happy. The prospect of a 
recourse to the CSM does not worry us. It seems clear to me, 
however, that the judicial initiatives of the District 
Attorney's Office are a matter of concern to those who believe 
themselves to be the subject of them. 
  [Buccini] Actually Berlusconi said something different from 
that. First, he attacked an unnamed magistrate. Now he is 
directly attacking your deputy, Gherardo Colombo, adding that 
the aim of the Publitalia investigation was to attack a 
political adversary during the election campaign, and is urging 
that the situation be remedied, to "take control of the 
situation in which Colombo is playing a leading role..." 
  [Borrelli] I consider it disgraceful to place a political 
interpretation on judicial initiatives which, apart from 
anything else, have been ratified by not one but three assistant 
attorneys and approved by the chief attorney. I deplore being 
dragged into these petty exchanges, but I am obliged to respond 
once again to defend my office, my magistrates, and the truth... 
This is not the first time that political intentions have been 
attributed to magistrates, with the sole aim of undermining 
their authority in order to defend those under investigation. I 
note that the unknown magistrate mentioned by Mr. Berlusconi in 
earlier remarks has now been named. This man, Gherardo Colombo, 
deserves respect for 20 years of service in the judiciary, 
during which time it has never been possible to level any 
charges of partiality or lack of independence at him. [Borrelli 
ends] 
  Blow after blow, the battle between Fininvest and the 
Attorney's Office came to a head after Silvio Berlusconi's 
latest attacks broadcast on the evening television news. But 
throughout the day there was a heavy atmosphere in the office in 
Milan. Initially, Saverio Borrelli was cunningly evasive: 
"What statements by Berlusconi? I would say there was some 
shouting, rather..." Then he began to issue a response. And 
his tone grew sharper by the hour. 
  [Buccini] Berlusconi talked about a system of justice 
working 
according to the clock and said: In any case, I am here to 
guarantee that such things do not happen again. He really has a 
grudge against the prosecuting attorneys, do you not think? Are 
you afraid that an attempt is being made to trap you in a corner? 
  [Borrelli] I do not know whether that is exactly what 
Berlusconi said. But anyone aiming to prevent the prosecuting 
authorities from exercising their penal activities, to influence 
their timing and methods, is someone who has in mind a prospect 
opposed to that of the law-based state, a state in which 
everyone is answerable to the law -- not only ordinary citizens, 
but also the so-called powerful. 
  [Buccini] But Berlusconi says that you took action on the 
basis of events that happened years ago. Why did you act right 
now? 
  [Borrelli] I must just say that this is not true. In the 
investigation in question the events date up to mid-January 1994. 
  [Buccini] A year ago you were under attack from [former 
Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, and now it is 
Berlusconi's turn. The faces have changed, but not the nature 
of the polemic. Why? Are you really sure that your conscience 
is clean? 
  [Borrelli] We have suffered many such attacks in the past, 
too. The truth has been distorted. Attempts have been made to 
attribute political intentions to initiatives taken to ascertain 
the truth. I reaffirm my complete confidence in the 
independence and honesty of all my prosecuting attorneys. As 
for myself, all kinds of things have been said about me. First, 
I was suspected of being a League supporter, then a sympathizer 
of Orlando's Rete, and last of being a communist or 
cryptocommunist... 
  [Buccini] Be that as it may, there is no question that your 
office is again under attack at present. You requested a 
transfer to the court of appeal. A few days ago your deputies 
urged you to stay on, in a letter in which they forecast further 
difficult times for the prosecuting authorities. Do you not 
think that you could meet their request? 
  [Borrelli] I am thinking about it. I will not conceal from 
you the fact that this letter had a profound effect on me. But 
it is not an easy decision. 
  [Buccini] Why not? 
  [Borrelli] Because... partly because, if I do stay on, there 
is a danger that I will be accused of being the deliverer. And 
I do not believe, and have never believed, in deliverers.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, March 13 (A.A) -- The "international 
Kurdish conference" held here for two days, with doubts that it 
produced the expected results for its organizers. 
  The biggest disillusion of separatists who organized the 
meeting was the fact that the Turkish society living in Belgium 
showed no reaction to the meeting and did not enter any dispute, 
despite the provocations the conference made. 
  Since the beginning of the conference Saturday [12 March], 
separatists kept on saying that they were facing danger and 
Turks can attack any time. However, there was neither an attack 
nor an interest towards the meeting. 
  The Belgian police took intensive measures around the 
Sheraton Hotel which the meeting was held. A gendarme official 
in site was saying, "the danger does not come from the Turkish 
society, but from the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants 
inside." 
  The Belgian media did not cover the conference and the small 
number of audience included Pakistanis invited to the 
conference, who were not listening to the conference but drawing 
pictures. 
  None of the separatists in the meeting were speaking 
Kurdish. 
All the addresses, excluding former True Path Party member 
Abdulmelik Firat, were speaking Turkish. 
  After PKK head Abdullah Ocalan's message, which claimed that 
the terror organization was not intending to divide Turkey, was 
read, a naive British participant who said "I did not know that 
he was not a terrorist and did not aim at dividing Turkey" was 
evaluated by the other participants as "the only person who took 
the message at face value." 
  Meanwhile member of Democracy Party Remzi Kartal took the 
floor to say that "they had been forced to carry an armed fight 
against Turkey." 
  The Democracy Party, which hold 13 seats at the Turkish 
Grand 
National Assembly denies that it has links with separatist 
terror organization PKK which claims nearly 11,000 lives in 
Turkey in a decade of its bloody campaign against the Turkish 
state and people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Canadian troops will be staying on in the former 
Yugoslavia, at least until the end of September. The federal 
Government says it has agreed to extend the mandate for 
providing peacekeepers to the UN force in Bosnia and Croatia for 
another six months. But it has refused to increase the number 
of soldiers Canada is providing. Michael McCullough reports: 
  [McCullough] Canada's commitment to keep troops in Bosnia 
and 
Croatia was due to expire at the end of this month. For a time 
there seemed to be some legitimate doubt concerning whether or 
not Canada would renew that commitment. There were concerns 
about costs estimated at $180 million a year, and Prime Minister 
Cretien openly wondered if, given all of the dangers Canadian 
soldiers faced, it is really worthwhile. But it is worthwhile 
according to Foreign Affairs Minister Andre Ouellet. He says 
Canada will commit to keep its soldiers there for another six 
months and provide assistance in a number of other ways. 
  [Begin Ouellet recording] We will continue financial support 
for various international humanitarian aid agencies and make 
military flights available to the United Nations to deliver that 
aid. [end recording] 
  [McCullough] Ouellet also downplayed the fact that while 
Canada has agreed to maintain its current troop strength, it has 
turned down the UN's latest appeal for additional soldiers.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has said that democracy 
means freedom but that no one has the right to violate the 
Constitution. She noted that the decision to lift the 
parliamentary immunity of certain Democracy Party [DEP] deputies 
is Turkey's internal affair. 
  In reply to a reporter's question aboard a plane on her way 
from Ankara to Balikesir, Ciller said that she explained the 
situation to the European Parliament officials with whom she 
met. Ciller recalled that a similar case had occurred in 
Belgium and that the immunity of certain deputies had been 
lifted. Turkish Radio and Television correspondent Yurdaer 
Tartan reports that Ciller said that democracy means freedom and 
that the True Path Party is the party that attaches the most 
importance to this principle. Ciller said: Everyone is 
commenting. Democracy is a regime in which freedoms and rights 
are balanced. No one has the right to help murderers under the 
guise of exercising their right to freedom. No one has the 
right to violate the constitution. That is not a state of law 
but one of anarchy.

<H5>  Statements by the Social Democratic Party of Austria </H5>
  Party Chairman [Franz] Vranitzky said: "This is a sad 
Sunday." Nevertheless, important objectives, such as entry into 
the European Union [EU], full employment, and social security, 
have to continue to be pursued. It is simple to give advice 
from the "box seat of the opposition" because the opposition 
does not have any responsibility. The resignation of [Carinthian 
Governor] Ambrozy is not the deciding issue, he said. 
  Commenting on Carinthia, Federal Manager [Josef] Cap said: 
"This is sad but not hopeless. We will nevertheless claim the 
provincial governorship." 
<H5>  Statements by the Austrian People's Party [OeVP]l </H5>
  Chairman [Erhard] Busek said: "It is a good day for the 
OeVP." The result reassures me, as far as the EU referendum and 
federal policies are concerned. The stability and the 
credibility of our politicians have paid off. 
  Secretary General [Ingrid] Korosec said: This is altogether 
a good result for the OeVP. [OeVP Governor of Carinthia 
Christoph] Zernatto has stood his ground in Carinthia. The 
losses in Salzburg and Tirol are smaller than predicted. 
<H5>  Statements by the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] </H5>
  [FPOe Chairman] [Joerg] Haider said: I will negotiate for 
the office of Carinthian governor. Talks with the OeVP will 
also be held in the other provinces. 
  Secretary General [Walter] Meischberger said: "This is a 
fantastic election success." Anyone else but Haider as a 
provincial governor would mean that the voters' will is being 
disregarded. At any rate, all three results are a clear answer 
from the voters to the government's results in the EU 
negotiations. 
<H5>  Statements by the Greens, Liberals </H5>
  Greens Floor Leader [Madeleine] Petrovic said: Tribute has 
been paid to our serious work and untiring support for 
environmental protection. The results can be regarded as a 
rejection of the way in which federal politicians are dealing 
with EU criteria. Federal Spokesman [Peter] Pilz said: "The 
results show that several things went wrong" in Brussels. 
  [Heide] Schmidt, the federal spokeswoman of the Liberal 
Forum, said: "The time for new thinking is not yet ripe." The 
electoral law, which is hostile toward minorities, has resulted 
in a distortion of the voters' will.

<F P=106> [Report signed "voel": "Smuggling of People Is a Thriving </F>
Business"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- At the security meeting entitled "The 
International Threat," which was held on Thursday [10 March] on 
the occasion of the Security and Safety fair in Vienna, Interior 
Minister Franz Loeschnak reported on new types of organized 
crime: The smuggling of refugees, mafia-type blackmail, and 
economic crimes. 
  According to Loeschnak, 5,000 to 10,000 people are 
"smuggled" 
into Austria illegally every year. Further tens of thousands, 
mainly from African countries, are transported by gangs to other 
countries via Austria. Loeschnak stated: "This is a thriving 
business." Up to $10,000 is being charged per person. 
  Another type of crime is also spreading in Austria, namely 
the extortion of money through blackmail. Loeschnak believes 
that "at least every third, but maybe even every second" citizen 
from Turkey and the former Yugoslavia is being blackmailed by 
organized gangs to pay protection money. 
  Austrian companies that are carrying out orders abroad are 
also faced with blackmail. Loeschnak claimed that they are 
"paying without hesitation" so as not to endanger their workers 
abroad. The climax of these criminal machinations has not yet 
been reached, and the international threat has reached a 
"considerable extent." 
  Loeschnak spoke of "very sophisticated" econmic crime where 
"big chiefs" of international concerns illegally "embezzle 
hundreds of millions of schillings, German marks, or dollars." 
  Loeschnak mentioned several measures to be taken by the 
executive bodies to get the situation under control. The 
establishment of special units are an initial step. In the 
sphere of drugs, specialist have been active for years. This 
must be extended to economic crimes, the smuggling of refugees 
and of cars. 
  To achieve success in the fight against organized crime, 
"suitable tools" are needed. Loeschnak mentioned the so-called 
bugging campaign, "no matter whether big, medium-sized, or 
small," and the state's regulation of evidence. "We should not 
develop any philosophies or principles in this respect. This is 
not important. What we need are suitable instruments." 
  In this respect, the interior minister clearly supported 
membership in the European Union, because international 
cooperation against cross-border crime must be intensified.

<F P=106> [Report signed "b.b.": "Fear of Imperial Russia"] </F>
  [Text] Vienna -- "The new democracies should be accepted 
into NATO as members without any further delay. This would also 
be in the interest of the Western alliance." Bronislaw 
Geremek's advice to Western leaders was very clear. At the 
weekend, the chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee of the 
Polish Parliament gave a lecture at the Institute for the 
Sciences of Man in Vienna on the issue of: "The collapse of 
communism and European security." 
  After the collapse of the communist regimes, Professor 
Geremek sees internal and external reasons for the feeling of 
insecurity in Central and East Europe: The conversion to the 
mechanisms of the market economy has led to a steep increase in 
the number of unemployed; the crime rate has also exploded, "a 
fact that is dramatically undermining public security." Of the 
external reasons he regards first of all Russia as the main 
source of danger "because it has not given up its imperial 
ambitions. Thus, NATO membership would significantly strengthen 
the feeling of security but also the process of democratization 
in the new democracies," Geremek said. 
  If, however, NATO were to continue to oppose expansion, the 
Polish politician suspects that "the spirit of Yalta would 
continue to prevail, and the division of the world would be 
prolonged. The imperial tendencies in Russia would even 
increase." Geremek believes that the current NATO cooperation 
scheme Partnership for Peace and the possibility for cooperation 
in the Western European Union is "not an adequate response to 
Russia's neo-imperial tendencies." 
  Europe is currently at a crossroads. Geremek: "Europe must 
look ahead and, especially on the issue of security policy, give 
up its traditional bureaucratic way of thinking." 
  According to agency reports from Brussels, Russia recently 
linked its participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program 
to a series of conditions: Moscow has demanded a veto on NATO 
planning, wants to complement or amend the program with a 
proposal of its own, and is seeking a special status within the 
framework of the Partnership. Said one NATO staffer: "That is 
unacceptable for us."

<F P=106> [Report by Erich Hoorn: "Czech Republic Woos Western </F>
Capital; 1.5 Billion From Austria"] 
  [Text] Vienna/Prague -- About 2,400 of the approximately 
10,000 registered foreign companies (joint ventures and 
100-percent subsidiaries) in the Czech Republic are Austrian, 
which means that Austria occupies second place behind Germany, 
Josef Altenburger, the Austrian trade delegate in Prague, 
stresses. 
  However, there are no spectacular Austrian investments such 
as Volkswagen (passenger cars) or Philip Morris (tobacco 
sector). It is mainly small- and medium-sized Austrian 
companies that are investing in the Czech Republic. They not 
only participate in local companies there, but also build 
factories from scratch. Therefore, Austria's presence in the 
republic is wide-ranging both in regional terms and regarding 
industrial branches, Altenburger says.

  Austrian companies are shifting certain production to the 
Czech Republic, because wages there are only about one-sixth of 
those in Austria. However, labor productivity is also lower. 
Wages differ strongly depending on sectors and regions. In 
Prague there is overemployment, skilled workers are scarce. 
  Following coupon privatization, Austrian companies have the 
opportunity for capital participation in these transformed 
companies, which need capital because this kind of privatization 
does not yield money for the companies. Therefore, management 
is often interested in foreign capital. Generally, 
participation is conducted by means of increasing capital in the 
form of machinery or equipment. Foreigners can also buy company 
shares from investment funds, from banks, or via the stock 
exchange. 
  In 1993, foreigners where, however, restrained: Instead of 
the expected $1.2 billion, they invested only $561 million. 
According to the Czech National Bank, this is linked with the 
separation from Slovakia and with the recession in the West. 
Furthermore, foreigners waited for the end of the first wave of 
coupon privatization in autumn. 
  Since 1990, $2.1 billion has been invested: Germany leads 
with $641 million, followed by the United States ($572), France 
($259), Belgium ($145), and Austria with $126 million (1.5 
billion schillings). 
  In 1993, the largest investor was the United States with 
$255 
million, followed by Germany ($82 million), and Austria with $55 
million, which corresponded to 9.7 percent of foreign 
investments.

  [Text] Changes have been made in the group of 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE shareholders. KURIER, which has so far held 
49.5 percent, is leaving and transferring its shares to the 
HANDELSBLATT publishing group, which now holds 99 percent of the 
company (1 percent still belongs to Peter Michael Lingens). 
Thus, the Austrian WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE has finally been integrated 
in a highly reputed, international publishing group, which 
comprises publications such as HANDELSBLATT, the German 
WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE, or the Swiss monthly BILANZ. In addition, 
linked with the group are the S. Fischer publishing house, the 
Rowohlt publishing house, the Droemersche publishing company, as 
well as SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN in the United States, to mention 
just a few. 
  These products and publishing companies have one thing in 
common -- a high standard which imposes a duty on us and gives 
you, the readers, the guarantee that WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE's lead in 
quality will be steadily increased.

  [Text] Vienna -- Even after the decision by the U.S. 
Eximbank to guarantee loans for the completion of the Temelin 
plant, Austria's efforts to prevent this Czech nuclear power 
plant continue. Over the weekend Lower Austria's Governor Erwin 
Proell demanded that the IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] check whether Western safety standards can be achieved 
at least at a rudimentary level during the expansion of the 
nuclear power plant. In addition, Proell called for a referendum 
on nuclear power in the Czech Republic. 
  On Sunday [13 March] Johannes Hawlik, environment spokesman 
of the Viennese section of the Austrian People's Party, called 
for an antinuclear policy including an antinuclear coordinator 
in the chancellor's office the establishement of a 1-billion 
schilling Eastern Ecological Fund to promote alternative 
energies and higher energy efficiency. 
  Peter Marizzi, federal manager of the Social Democratic 
Party 
of Austria, said that in the future the Austrian people will 
think twice whether they should buy products of the U.S. company 
Westinghouse, which reequips Temelin with safety technology on 
the basis of Eximbank financing. 
  The Global 2000 environmentalist organization is taking hope 
from a letter by Democratic Congressman John D. Dingell, dated 
10 March 1994, to Eximbank President Kenneth Brody. In this 
letter Dingell, chairman of the Oversight and Investigations 
Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, requests all 
relevant documents for a "review" of the Eximbank guarantees for 
Temelin by 25 March. Global 2000 doubts that the Eximbank even 
has the requested documents.

of Austria [SPOe] in the diet elections in Carinthia, the 
expected reshuffle was decided today: Health Minister Michael 
Ausserwinkler will replace the unfortunate SPOe Chairman Peter 
Ambrozy. Ambrozy will resign from all political functions. 
  Ausserwinkler immediately announced his claim to the 
position 
of provincial governor. It is logical that the representative 
of the party that got the most votes should become governor. 
The goal of the negotiations with the Austrian People's Party 
is a functioning government, he said.

<F P=106> [Report signed "ROe": "Even FPOe and Greens Supporters `In </F>
Favor of EU'"] 
  [Text] On Monday [14 March] at the Center for Applied 
Political Research, Fritz Plasser and Peter Ulram presented the 
results of telephone surveys carried out by the Fessel Institute 
and the Market Research Organization analyzing the results of 
Sunday's provincial elections. The survey shows an atmosphere 
"in favor of the European Union [EU]," even among supporters of 
the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] and the Greens. 
  The analysis shows that subjects relevant to the EU and 
membership questions have been superimposed on the provincial 
elections, Ulram said. Some 54 percent of the 1,500 persons 
asked (500 in each province where elections were held), took a 
positive view toward EU accession, while 25 declared that they 
were against it, and 21 were still undecided. The figures were, 
of course, different in the individual provinces: With 62 
percent supporters and 19 percent opponents, the mood in favor 
of the EU is most marked in Carinthia. In Salzburg 58 percent 
were in favor of accession and 22 percent skeptical. Even in 
Tirol the EU supporters are slightly ahead of opponents: 41 
percent took a positive view, 35 percent said they were 
skeptical, and 23 percent were still undecided. 
  The scientists also drew cautious conclusions for the 
nationwide parliamentary election in the fall: The Social 
Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's 
Party [OeVP] are struggling with structural problems. After its 
unsuccessful petition drive for a nationwide referendum [on the 
immigration issue], the FPOe has overcome its low, and, 
according to Plasser, it might climb across the 20-percent 
level. Despite the failure in Sunday's election, the chances 
for the Liberal Forum to stay in Parliament are still intact, 
and the Greens have overcome their structural problems. 
  The success of the Tirolean OeVP, which managed to retain 
its 
absolute majority of parliamentary seats and in the government, 
is partly the result of its EU strategy. Plasser said that 
Governor Wendelin Weingartner managed to do something that is 
normally bound to fail, namely to walk a tightrope: He managed 
to secure the support for the OeVP of both EU supporters (with 
his basically positive attitude) and EU skeptics (by signalling 
that he was ready to fight for the best possible results for 
Tirol). 
  Plasser said that one interesting feature was that EU 
supporters are not confined to the SPOe, OeVP and the Liberal 
Forum but that EU accession is also backed by FPOe and Greens 
supporters. FPOe supporters appeared to be polarized in 
Sunday's election (with 44 percent for and 39 percent against EU 
entry), a phenomenon that has appeared in nationwide surveys 
before, while among the Greens there is a clear 59:19 percent 
majority against membership. In view of these figures, Plasser 
expects FPOe Chairman Joerg Haider to make a tactical change of 
course: His policy critical of the EU was probably timed to 
last exactly until 13 March, and, Plasser suspects, the FPOe 
leader will now quietly wait for the EU referendum and not raise 
the EU issue until the parliamentary election campaign -- when 
he knows he can benefit from it again. 
  According to a preliminary analysis of the election result 
carried out by the IFES [Institute for Empirical Social 
Research] Institute as early as on Sunday night, the result of 
the EU negotiations had a strong influence on the election 
result in Tirol, Carinthia, and Salzburg. By and large, it 
turned out that the FPOe mainly appealed to people who are 
worried about their future, while the Greens rather managed to 
win the support of Europessimists. 
  On the other hand, both the FPOe and the Greens lost EU 
supporters, which benefitted not only the two coalition parties 
but also the Liberal Forum. It was in Tirol and Salzburg, in 
particular, where the FPOe lost a significant number of EU 
supporters. The election analysis shows that it was possible to 
win votes with a clear, pro-EU position. 
  The analysis carried out by IFES for ORF television shows 
that there was strong movement within the Carinthian electorate. 
Five percent of former SPOe voters cast their vote in favor of 
the OeVP this time, while another 5 percent voted for the FPOe. 
Yet, the OeVP not only won votes from the SPOe but also 4 
percent from the FPOe. On the other hand, 6 percent of former 
OeVP voters abstained, while 1.5 percent wandered off both to 
the SPOe and the FPOe. According to this analysis, the FPOe, in 
turn, lost 1 percent of its voters to the Liberal Forum. The 
FPOe's success was mainly the result of people who abstained in 
previous elections and now voted for it. 
  According to IFES, in Salzburg the movements of voters 
between the parties was not quite as dramatic as in Carinthia. 
There, the OeVP lost 4 percent to the FPOe and more than 1 
percent to the Greens. On the other hand, the OeVP received 1.2 
percent of former FPOe voters. The SPOe lost 2 percent each to 
the FPOe and the Liberal Forum. One percent of former Greens 
voters wandered off to the Liberal Forum. Three percent of 
former FPOe voters did not go to the polls this time.

<F P=106> [Report by Andreas Schwarz: "Waldheim Hopes for Watch List </F>
Revision"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Former Austrian President Kurt Waldheim 
is of the opinion that the U.S. accusations against him because 
of his wartime past, which have now been published, have long 
been refuted and he hopes now the "Watch List" decision will 
finally be revised. Austria will now decide on what further 
steps are to be taken. This was stated by Waldheim in an 
interview with DIE PRESSE following the U.S. Justice Department 
publication of the report that was the basis of the Watch List 
decision in 1987. It accuses Waldheim of a "significant role" 
in participating in or supporting Nazi activities. 
  "The file contains accusations that have been known for 
years, have long been refuted, and have been examined thoroughly 
by three investigating committees; I have never been accused of 
any personally culpable behavior," Waldheim said. Waldheim 
cites a few examples: The accusation that he participated in 
the transport of imprisoned civilians to concentration camps was 
refuted already in 1988 in the course of the investigations of 
the Historians' Commission: "This was the famous Plenca 
document, by which DER SPIEGEL was taken in and which then 
turned out to be forged." Concerning the accusation that 
Waldheim was involved in the mistreatment and execution of 
imprisoned soldiers, "the investigation by the British Defense 
Ministry clearly noted that I was not involved." 
  One cannot speak at all of any attempts to cover up his past 
after his activities in the Balkans became known. Waldheim has 
"repeatedly and categorically rejected" accusations in U.S. 
newspapers that the Soviets knew about his past and that, 
therefore, he, Waldheim, was a target for blackmail as UN 
secretary general. 
  Yesterday Waldheim issued a statement; he also anticipates 
that a clarifying statement will be issued by the Foreign 
Ministry. The publication of the paper, which had been kept 
under lock and key for seven years -- "it was not published 
because it does not contain any proof" -- has started some 
movement; he will now examine the possibilities of taking action 
against the Watch List decision. Waldheim does not rule out the 
prospect that the decision could be reversed. 
  For Foreign Minister Mock so far "only the slanderous 
concoction by Mr. Sher is known" (author of the paper), now all 
the papers have to be examined. On Monday [14 March] the 
Foreign Ministry expressly welcomed the publication of the 
report. Several international investigations have shown that 
the "known accusations" against Waldheim, which it contains, 
"lack any foundation."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hans Rauscher: "Waldheim Affair: Seven </F>
Years Later -- Nothing New"] 
  [Text] "U.S. Report Links Waldheim With Atrocities" -- 
this is the headline in THE WASHINGTON POST. The secret report 
by the U.S. Justice Department, which was the basis for putting 
the then Austrian president on the Watch List and isolating him 
internationally, has now been published (because of a court 
ruling). 
  The world, which by this time is only moderately interested, 
and Austria itself now can examine what excited us seven years 
ago, what caused a rift right through the country, but also 
forced us for the first time to deal with the Nazi past that had 
been pushed away. 
  A first examination of the essence of the 204-page report 
provides certainty: The differing assessment that had to be 
reached seven years ago by any serious observer, including the 
author of these lines, remains correct. 
  As an intelligence officer in the Balkans, Kurt Waldheim 
dealt with war crimes in a clerical manner, so to speak; he 
collected, summarized, and signed reports about them. Thus, he 
knew about them. He was not involved in them in the sense of 
having any authority to give orders. However, the report by the 
U.S. Justice Department interprets this work massively to 
Waldheim's disadvantage. 
  Waldheim was certainly a small cog, but he was located in an 
important place in the German military machine, contributing to 
the functioning of this machine. But he did not commit any 
crimes. For the U.S. Watch List decision, however, it was 
unimportant whether Waldheim had only collected reports about 
atrocities or had provided the "logistical conditions" for them. 
The corresponding law is so flexible that he had to be covered 
by it. 
  The political assessment is something quite different. 
Today, as in the past, one can say: Waldheim suffered an 
injustice because his work in the Balkans was assessed too 
harshly, too ignorantly, and probably also too maliciously by 
the U.S. authorities and the U.S. public. It is also a fact, 
however, that he kept silent about this work and covered it up 
-- and this made him untenable as Austrian president.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi Opens Meeting of Environment </F>
Ministers"] 
  [Excerpts] Florence, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- The environment 
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations, 
meeting here today and tomorrow for informal talks to prepare 
for the G-7 summit in Naples in July, are now given the 
opportunity to "jointly reflect on the relationships between the 
environment, technological progress and economic development," 
said Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy. 
  Opening the assembly in historic Palazzo Pitti, the 
government leader pointedly asked, "If the developing countries 
were to reach the same rate of consumption as our own in an 
uncontrolled way, how many more planets other than the earth 
would we need?" 
  The Italian [environment] minister, Valdo Spini, reminded 
his 
colleagues that, "One of the G-7 priorities should be that of 
launching a vast program of technological partnership to 
facilitate access to appropriate standards of high technology 
for the protection of the global environment. 
  ``More in general, if we do not want developing nations to 
industrialize according to polluting models of the past, we 
cannot preach to them. We must, rather, help them introduce new 
clean technologies,'' said Spini. 
  Discussing the search for new instruments for financing 
sustainable development, the minister said, "Our economies will 
benefit from a partial shift in the distribution of taxes away 
from economic assets, such as work and capital, and towards the 
so-called environmentally-harmful, such as wastes, emissions and 
non-renewal resources. 
  ``Eco-taxes can provide funds for the reduction of the 
public 
deficit and public-sector spending requirements at a cost lower 
than conventional rates,'' said the minister. Pursuing the same 
theme, Spini said, "Thanks to the fiscal lever, it will be 
possible to finance indispensable environment protection 
programs which involve job creation. The white paper approved 
by the European Union last December," he continued, "clarifies 
how an ambitious environment policy, as [European Commission 
President] Jacques Delors says, can create hundreds of thousands 
of jobs." 
  Concluding his remarks, the minister noted that the links 
between new jobs and eco-taxes will come up for further 
discussion in Detroit where the G-7 labor ministers begin 
meeting Monday [14 March]. [passage omitted] 
  Later in the day, Ciampi noted, "There are no simple 
solutions for complex problems. What is required is a 
systematic, open and innovative approach, with coordinated 
answers, more valid than the sum of the single answers." 
  In his statement to the ministers, the premier focused on 
the 
problem of financial resources and the aggravation of this 
problem by the present recession. In this connection he cited 
the need for a further search for "original solutions, based not 
so much on greater budget allocations as on the careful 
management of what we have available, on suiting our conduct to 
new development requirements, on a commitment to appropriate 
fiscal and credit incentive instruments, on further recourse to 
measures for energy saving and the development of renewable 
resources." Thus, he added, it will be necessary to "rule 
technological progress and not be ruled by it." 
  According to Ciampi, the "essence of sustainable development 
is, in fact, in a commitment to harmonize solid and lasting 
economic growth through the rational utilization of materials 
and economically-scarce energy resources, along with the need to 
avoid interventions by man which have negative impact on the 
local and global environment." 
  After noting the growing role played by environmental issues 
in the work of the annual G-7 summits, the premier recalled that 
the Rio de Janeiro Earth Conference "highlighted in an 
unequivocal way the unavoidable link between safeguarding the 
environment, productive processes and technologies." This is a 
matter of, on the one hand, "preventing pollution, climatic 
changes, the alteration of great natural spaces and, on the 
other, work for governing and quickly directing complex 
phenomena linked to populations and their habits, such as those 
related to disorderly demographic growth." 
  The "keystone" for erecting "a new concept of development," 
one which takes environmental issues into the picture, the 
premier continued, is the "capability of the industrialized 
nations to reduce the environmental impact of their economic 
activities and, at the same time, help developing countries to 
provide themselves with development models which are less 
wasteful and better able to sustain themselves than the ones we 
have adopted to reach our present stage of growth." Research 
and the transfer of technologies from the North to the South "to 
foster the social and economic take-off of the Third World" will 
play a decisive role, he added. 
  Italy is a Mediterranean country, in a region in which 
environmental risks are more acute and more complex because of 
their social and economic ramifications, said Ciampi. Thus, 
Italy is aware of the urgency of these problems. 
  On related front, the premier told the ministers Italy 
intends to work for "an open and constructive dialogue for the 
development of channels of communication and exchange" between 
the two shores of the Mediterranean. He went on to underscore 
the need for moves to block "destabilization and the 
proliferation of the phenonena of fundamentalism and rejection 
of the West, also with a view to sustaining and cooperation with 
the Middle East peace process." 
  Also to be avoided, he said, is allowing the climate of 
confidence created with the Israeli-Palestine Liberation 
Organization agreement signed in December "to give way to new 
demonstrations of hatred and intolerance. For this purpose, the 
Italian government has singled out the International Affairs 
Institute in Rome as a preliminary and useful channel for 
broadening these issues, initially non-governmental in nature 
and then liable to more direct involvement of the governments 
concerned. 
  ``The Mediterranean dimension in the environment and 
development is, therefore, placed for the Italian government as 
a test at the regional level of the challenges which sweep 
contemporary society and the international community in its 
entirety,'' he added. 
  Concluding his remarks, the premier noted, "Nearly 80 
percent 
of the planet's population live in the Third world. It is up to 
us to solve the problem of how to help them improve their state, 
to uproot poverty and hunger, but also to give themselves 
social, economic and physiological development to allow them all 
access to dignified living conditions."

<F P=106> [Paul Brown and John Vidal report: "Catastrophe Threatens </F>
World's Fisheries as Stocks Fall"] 
  [Text] The world's fishing stocks are being rapidly 
depleted with disastrous repercussions in places as far apart as 
the corridors of power in Brussels, the unemployment queues in 
North America's eastern seaboard and the diets of people in the 
Third World. 
  According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture 
Organisation [FAO], which monitors fish stocks, nine of the 
world's 17 main fishing grounds are suffering potentially 
catastrophic declines in some species. 
  An FAO paper to be published later this month warns of the 
"severe" political and economic consequences of not 
rationalising the industry along "sustainable lines." 
  While rich countries will find previously common fish 
becoming luxury foods, the FAO warns that rising populations, 
migration to coastal cities and sustained high demand in the 
North could be catastrophic for many poor countries. 
  "The most severe impacts would be in East and South Asia 
where fish play a vital role in the diet," says the report. "An 
additional 8.5 million tons of fish a year will be needed by 
2010 just to maintain present consumption levels in this region." 
  The FAO attempts to address the problem of managing the 
free-for-all in the world's oceans at a four-day meeting which 
starts in New York on Monday. But the political problems, as 
seen this week in negotiations over Norway's entry to EU 
[European Union], are intractable. 
  Europe's fishing industry shows the failure to cope with 
competing ecological and political demands. In Hull, 30,000 
jobs have gone in the fishing industry since 1945, and a 
deep-sea trawler fleet of 300 smallish vessels has been replaced 
by 15 superships. 
  In 1976 the herring fishery collapsed completely and fishing 
was banned. It took until the 1980's for stocks to recover but 
quotas are set far below historic catches to prevent another 
population crash. 
  The cod, haddock and plaice fisheries are now going the same 
way even though quotas are in place. Fish are getting smaller 
and fewer and most do not reach sexual maturity before being 
caught. Scientists believe that by 1995 there may be so few cod 
and haddock left that commercial fishing may be uneconomic and 
it may be years before stocks recover sufficiently to sustain 
even a small European fishing industry. 
  Most of the world's 200 million people who directly and 
indirectly depend on fishing for a livelihood live in coastal 
communities in the developing world. Marine fishing is the 
world's most valuable source of protein, providing more than 
beef or pork. Twenty percent of the world's animal-based protein 
comes from the sea but many developing countries depend for more 
than half of their diet on the sea. 
  The roots of the fishing crisis lie partly in the 
over-exploitation of northern fishing grounds but also in the 
heavy subsidising of fishing fleets. The FAO estimates that 
annual spending on fishing amounts to $124 billion (83 billion 
pounds) to catch $70 billion (47 billion pounds) of fish. 
  European Union and international fleets are increasingly 
moving in on traditional Third World fisheries, says Indrani 
Lutchman, fisheries officer at the World Wide Fund for Nature. 
The FAO estimates that almost 45 percent of the money earned by 
the fish trade comes from fish caught in developing world waters. 
  "Having exhausted many of their own fishing grounds, the 
North is now turning to the South and undermining the 
livelihoods of coastal communities. More than 25 percent of all 
fish consumed in the EU are caught by EU-registered boats 
fishing in unpoliced Third World waters." 
  Uncontrolled fishing by foreign fleets off Sierra Leone has 
led to a serious decline in the catch of traditional fishermen, 
who supply 75 percent of their country's consumption of animal 
protein. 
  Developing countries, backed by international loans, have 
invested heavily in fishing to earn foreign exchange via 
exports, says Peter Weber, a researcher with the Worldwatch 
Institute in Washington. Much of their catch is denied local 
consumers and threatens the inshore fisheries. The FAO 
estimates that almost 40 percent of the fish caught in the world 
are exported, 90 percent of it to Japan, the United States and 
the EU. 
  New technology, including satellites, is used to locate fish 
and has boosted world catches 6.6 percent a year from 22 million 
tons in 1950 to a record high of 100 million tons in 1989. 
Fishing became a boom industry in the 1980's, increasing a 
third in size and doubling its economic value. 
  In the last three years the world catch has declined to 
about 
97 million tons largely because of declining catches and the 
confusion in former Soviet fleets. Twenty countries, led by 
China, Japan, Peru, Chile, the United States and India catch 
almost 80 per cent of all fish. 
  Not all the over-exploitation of the oceans can be explained 
by overfishing. Coastal waters contain the richest sources of 
food for fish but are also the most polluted and vulnerable to 
development. Almost two thirds of all commercially valuable fish 
spend the first, vulnerable stages of their life in these waters 
where 90 percent of the world's marine catch is caught. 
  Tourist industry pressures have depleted many wetland, 
mangrove and estuary habitats in the Far East and the 
Mediterranean. Pacific salmon have largely disappeared, says 
the Worldwatch Institute, because the freshwater streams where 
they spawn have been soiled or are blocked by dams. Restoring 
the streams may cost more than $2 billion (1.3 billion pounds) 
in the United States alone. 
  The only hope of maintaining stocks at present levels, says 
the FAO, is through better management. This could yield 
approximately 20 million more tons. The second source of 
additional food could come from the 30 million tons of fish 
presently converted into fishmeal for pigs, chicken, shrimp and 
salmon. Ten million tons could be saved from discarded fish.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniela Polizzi and Pier Luigi Todisco: "Where </F>
the Emir Buys"] 
  [Text] Arab finance: The Gulf countries' European 
offensive. In Italy, they already have a 7-percent stake in La 
Rinascente. In France, they are into Total and ELF. And in the 
center of London, Arab capital is creating a second City. 
  They ended 1993 triumphantly. In December, 1 percent of 
Total 
passed into the hands of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority 
(ADIA). And in Italy, the Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) 
acquired a 7-percent stake in the La Rinascente group's capital 
shares. They did not stop with the new year. Only last week, 
Saudi businessman 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sulayman acquired a 
1-percent stake in the French petrochemical giant ELF, the 
privatization of which started last Tuesday [1 February], and 
thus enriched his already well-stocked portfolio, which includes 
2 percent of Accor and Club Med. 
  In sum, Arab financiers' interest in Europe is on the rise 
again. Attracted by the recession and the devaluation of the 
currencies of some European countries, investment companies, 
commercial banks, and businessmen have thrown themselves into 
the pursuit of profitable pieces of business. First among them 
is Nemir Kirdar, of Iraqi origin and former manager of Chase 
Manhattan of London, who today heads Investcorp, a powerful 
investment company employing 70 financiers, all recruited at 
top-drawer prices from Salomon Brothers, Goldman-Sachs, and 
Morgan Stanley. In the last five years, the company, which is 
quoted on the Bahrain Stock Exchange, has invested 8.8 trillion 
lire in holdings in Europe. In its most recent operation, last 
fall--and in keeping with its philosophy of always buying 
distressed companies in order to put them back on their feet and 
reap substantial capital gains--it acquired 50 percent of the 
capital shares of Italy's Gucci company. The remainder was 
already in Investcorp's portfolio. 
  The case that most symbolizes this strategy was the 
acquisition of the Saks Fifth Avenue chain of department stores 
in the United States. On the verge of bankruptcy, the chain was 
sold to Investcorp by Bat Industries for less than 200 billion 
lire in 1989, and sold again two years later for approximately 
double that price. In its 12 years of life, Investcorp's 
stockholders have injected approximately 2 trillion lire into 
its capital, which is divided among Saudi Arabia (25 percent), 
Bahrain (24.5 percent), Arab Emirates (11.5 percent), and Qatar 
and Oman (7.5 percent each). The rest is shared among its 
executives. These include notables such as Kuwait's former prime 
minister, 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Atiki. Much of its capital is invested 
in the luxury sector, in big names such as New York's Tiffany's 
jewelry store and Germany's haute couture house Mondi. Marketing 
is also one of the sectors of major interest to Cem Cesmig, 
general manager for Europe, as his recent acquisitions 
demonstrate: Camelot Music, the U.S. chain of music stores, and 
Great Britain's Sports &amp; Recreation and Circle K Corporation 
stores. 
  Stockholders are happy with Investcorp's performance. In 
1993, profits increased by 7.3 percent to 110 billion lire, and 
the return on its capital investments was 19.3 percent. Not all 
its deals, however, have had a happy ending. For example, the 
French company Chaumet, bought five years ago on the brink of 
collapse, continues to weigh down the financiers' portfolio with 
losses hovering around 180 billion lire a year. And the listing 
of the Swiss company Breguet on the stock market, planned for 
last fall, was cancelled owing to Breguet's financial 
difficulties. 
<H5>  The King's Friend </H5>
  Different but just as aggressive has been financier Rafic 
Hariri's expansion during these years. He chose on the one hand 
to build strong ties with the French banking system, and on the 
other to build a fortune, operating between France and England, 
in the real estate sector. 
  A native of Lebanon, where he was minister of foreign 
affairs 
and prime minister, Hariri works mostly on behalf of King Fahd 
of Saudi Arabia. Among other things, the king received a letter 
around the middle of January, signed by Italian Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, inviting him to participate, by way of 
investments, in the Italian privatization process. 
  Hariri has bought, for King Fahd, all of Europe's most 
famous 
hotels, from the Ritz to the Royal Monceau of Paris, to 
Brussels's Sheraton, to Montecarlo's Palace. All of these 
holdings, totaling 400,000 square meters, are controlled by the 
French real estate holding company Fradim, which in turn is 
controlled by the HPI financial intermediary. HPI also controls 
industrial holdings in French plastic packaging and oil products 
processing enterprises, for the account of Saudi Arabia. 
  Even more significant are Hariri's stock cross-links with 
Compagnie de Suez and Paribas (3 percent and 5 percent 
respectively). Together with Banque Indosuez, of which he is a 
director, Hariri controls the Banque Francaise de l'Orient, 
which is the operating arm for the development of Franco-Saudi 
interests in all the Far East countries. 
  "At any rate," Martin Glen of Lehman Brothers of London told 
IL MONDO, "the oil sector remains the Arab countries' only real 
strategic investment in Europe. Holdings in other sectors are, 
for the most part, strictly financial." In fact, among the 
privatizations recently launched by France, those selected by 
those countries' investors were precisely oil companies such as 
ELF and Total. In these operations, the principal players were 
private groups from the United Arab Emirates, which at this 
point in time have the most liquidity at their disposal. Abu 
Dhabi, through the ADIA, whose capital is approximately 260 
trillion lire, is the richest of them all. It controls three 
quarters of the 2.2 million barrels of oil extracted daily by 
the Federation of Emirates. In France, the ADIA, together with 
the Qatar government, has bought 40 percent of the Compagnie 
Petrochimique du Nord. And, again in France, the ADIA has 
founded Siparex, a financial holding and assets management 
intermediary. 
  Real estate represents another sector of interest but, in 
this case, to the Arab banks instead, and in particular the 
Lebanese banks, which at the European level are concentrated 
mostly in France. After the failure of several institutions that 
during the 1980s lived off the arms trade, a new generation of 
Lebanese banks is taking root in Paris. These include Banorab, 
Audi, Saradar, and Faransa, private banks that are prospering on 
financing the reconstruction of Beirut and Kuwait. "The Lebanese 
banks," Rashid Hossan, of London's Saudi Research Institute, 
told IL MONDO, "are now asserting themselves as the entire Arab 
world's financial reference point in Europe." The management of 
Arab fortunes abroad is becoming the new business of many Arab 
banks in the West. In London, observers connected with Morgan 
Stanley and Lehman Brothers speak of the birth of a kind of 
second financial center that is gradually taking place there. 
Shortly before Christmas, the Bahrain and Kuwait Bank, 
International Investors, and the Arab Banking Corporation opened 
private banking offices in the triangle that runs from Oxford 
Street to Hyde Park and up to Regent Street. "Huge quantities of 
money are pouring into London at this time," adds Martin Glen of 
Lehman Brothers, "from Bahrain builders, Qatar gas 
industrialists, and big importers in Dubai, a platform for 
trading with Iran. The Arab banks, too, want to profit from the 
fat commissions charged in this sector." 
<H5>  The Shaykh's Troubles </H5>
  Faced with the resurgence of activism on the part of the 
private operators, some big government-connected investors have 
brought their operations to a halt, so as to initiate a profound 
internal reorganization. There is, for example, the Kuwait 
Investment Office (KIO), the financial operating arm of Kuwaiti 
Shaykh Jaber Al-Sabah whose assets in the mid-1980s topped $100 
billion and now total less than half that amount. The Gulf war 
wounds are only partly responsible for their collapse. In recent 
years, KIO's managers have made several strategic blunders. 
  One was that of associating themselves in Spain with the 
unscrupulous Catalan financier Xavier de La Rosa, with whom, in 
1986, the Kuwaiti institution raided the Torras group, a 
conglomerate with interests mainly in the real estate, chemical, 
and paper industry sectors. In the six years that followed, the 
Torras group lost more than $4 billion (slightly less than 7 
trillion lire at the present rate of exchange), owing mainly to 
de La Rosa's turbid management of the company's funds. Another 
was the acquisition of 21.7 percent of British Petroleum [BP] 
for the account of the Kuwait Petroleum Company toward the end 
of the 1980s, in the hope of thus circumventing London's tax 
authorities (operations by government institutions are 
tax-exempt). The Kuwaitis were counting on reselling more than 
half of their share of BP free of any payment to the British 
Treasury. Three years ago the sale was completed. But the London 
government did not play ball, and, last September, took the case 
to court, impelling KIO to come to terms. Just last week, an 
agreement was outlined that will cost the Kuwaitis not less than 
1 trillion lire. 
  And in Germany, where Shaykh Al-Sabah's financiers hold 
substantial stakes in groups such as Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, 
and Hoechst, they are having to cope with the serious crisis 
confronting Metallgesellschaft, the metallurgical company that 
in its 1992/93 financial year alone lost almost 2 trillion lire. 
KIO owns one fifth of Metallgesellschaft's capital stock. 
  In the wake of an intervention by Kuwait's parliament, many 
of those managing the shaykh's capital have rolled. And the two 
new men in charge, Yusuf al-Awadi for KIO and Ali Rashid al-Badr 
for Kuwait Investment Authority [KIA] (the first subordinate to 
the second), are now having to restructure the portfolio in 
depth. In keeping with the new course, the capital increase that 
has been decided on to save Metallgesellschaft will not be 
subscribed by KIA (which controls the Kuwaiti holding). This 
will have the effect of reducing KIA's stake in that company. 
<H5>  The Colonel's Tricks </H5>
  The holdings of Libyan investment institutions have also 
undergone a profound restructuring. But the reasons in this case 
are attributable mainly to circumstances over which the 
institutions have no control. The embargo against Libya decreed 
by the UN, in order to obtain Tripoli's compliance with UN 
resolutions relative to terrorism, entered into effect around 
the beginning of last December, after a long arm-wrestle with 
Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi that gave his financiers ample 
time to dilute Libyan holdings abroad or to hide them in tax 
havens, and so avoid the freeze that would result from the 
embargo. 
  Last October, for example, an Oilinvest increase of 
exclusively Italian capital reduced the Libyan holding to a 
minority level. Tripoli's international activities in the oil 
sector are all concentrated in Oilinvest which has total annual 
billings of over 11 trillion lire. The operation was subscribed 
entirely by the other partners, namely: the Novara-based Armani 
Brothers oil group, which now holds 13 percent; shipowner 
Corrado Montanari; Mario Busenti, managing director of the 
Rome-based SIRM [Italian Maritime Radio Company]; Veneto 
entrepreneur Pietro Triboldi; and four foreign operators of the 
sector. Each of the latter seven partners now holds 6 percent, 
bringing this coterie's total holdings to 55 percent of 
Oilinvest's capital. The remaining 45 percent continues held by 
Libya. 
  Still not content, Tripoli's financiers carried out a 
similar 
operation on Tamoil, Oilinvest's principal holding. Again, an 
Italian coterie led by Armani, Montanari, and Triboldi acquired 
a total of 55 percent of Tamoil's shares. The latter two also 
acquired, respectively, the Tamoil Transport and Chempetrol 
Overseas companies, both from the Tamoil group. In spite of its 
ups and downs, however, Tamoil is not abandoning the expansion 
of its core business, oil: It has entered the lists, together 
with the API [Italian Oil Company], to take over the Cameli 
activities in the oil sector. 
  Lafico, which controls all Libyan interests in non-oil 
sectors, with international activities put at around 35 trillion 
lire, has also reconfigured them to be able to continue doing 
business. In London, for example, it has formed the Security 
International Retail Trading company, in partnership with a 
local company. In Italy, Lafico owns some tens of minor 
holdings. In its most recent operation, in 1993, it acquired the 
Ermitage Hotel, on the Adriatic riviera at Pesaro. And in the 
rest of Europe it has holdings such as 33 percent of the 
Metropole Hotel chain and, at least up to the start of the 
sanctions, controlling stakes in several companies. But it has 
also divested itself of some, as in the case of Kaelble, in 
which it has reduced its holding from 93 percent to a minority 
level.

<F P=106> [Article by Lionel Barber: "More Does Not Mean Merrier"] </F>
  [Text] The smart money is on a deal. But whatever the 
outcome of tomorrow's emergency foreign ministers meeting in 
Brussels, the latest crisis over enlargement of the European 
Union [EU] seems certain to have far-reaching repercussions. 
  Much more than a few thousand tonnes of Norwegian fish is at 
stake. Either through miscalculation or as a matter of 
principle, the UK has forced its EU partners to confront the one 
issue which most would prefer to ignore: the distribution of 
power in an expanded Union. 
  The resulting clash has pushed the enlargement talks to the 
brink of collapse. Britain, and to a lesser extent Spain, stand 
accused of breaking the pledge of the twelve to wrap up 
negotiations by early March so that Sweden, Finland, Austria, 
and Norway can enter the Union by January 1 1995. 
  The row has exposed the faultlines in the Union which the 
Maastricht treaty failed to close: between a rich north and a 
poorer south; between big and small member states; between 
sovereignty- conscious countries such as the UK, which hankers 
for a looser Union based on inter-governmental co-operation, and 
federalists such as Belgium and the Netherlands which want 
faster integration and streamlined decision-making. 
  Diplomats in Brussels remain baffled at the readiness of Mr 
John Major's government to risk sacrificing enlargement, a 
policy which seemed central to its aim of a wider Union. "The 
British are playing politics at any price," said one German 
official, "but this is a very dangerous game." 
  There has always been a paradoxical element in plans to 
expand the Union. Increasing the number of member states will, 
at some point, require a reform of collective decision-making. 
Without such an overhaul, the Union risks grinding to a halt, 
says Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and the senior 
British commissioner in Brussels. 
  Yet the basic cogs in the EU's machine have remained 
unchanged for 35 years, in spite of a doubling of member states 
from six to 12. The number of commissioners and official 
languages has crept up to 17 and nine respectively, though some 
are visibly underemployed. Above all, the EU still runs by a 
"weighted voting" system, whereby the voice of the bigger 
countries is reduced so as not to drown smaller neighbours. 
  At the Lisbon summit in June 1992, the 12 agreed that it was 
more important to press ahead with enlargement than tinker with 
the institutional balance of the Union. Leaders concluded that 
it was better to delay reforms until the next batch of entrants, 
the Central and East Europeans, Malta and possibly Cyprus. At 
this point, it was agreed, reform of decision-making in a union 
of 20- plus countries would become irresistible. 
  Crucially, the Lisbon summit understanding maintained the 
principle of the "blocking minority," whereby a member state 
mustering sufficient support can thwart the legislative 
intentions of its partners. 
  Until the latest British and Spanish interventions, it had 
been assumed that the number of votes required to form a 
blocking minority would rise slightly to take account of the 
four new members. Thus the current proposal is to increase the 
present 23 votes out of a total of 76, to 27 votes out of an 
expanded total of 90. The compromise maintains the proportion 
needed for a blocking minority at roughly 30 per cent; but it 
has two big drawbacks: First, the increase from 23 to 27 further 
distorts the relationship between a country's voting strength 
and population. It would mean that a combination of smaller 
states could technically outvote large states representing 40 
per cent of the population of the Union. "This raises an 
important democratic principle," says a UK diplomat. 
  Second, the end of the 23-vote threshold would mean that two 
large countries and one small country could no longer join 
forces to block measures. Spain, fearful that enlargement will 
tilt the political gravity of the Union to the north, wants to 
preserve the 23-vote threshold on core Mediterranean issues such 
as agriculture. British officials argue, too, that the 
power-sharing dispute is about vital national interests. A 
recent survey of Whitehall departments says one UK official, 
suggested "there was greater advantage in forming a blocking 
minority rather than forming a qualified majority (needed to 
push decisions through)." 
  Where do the British believe they are most at risk in being 
outvoted? One answer is trade policy, where the UK has 
traditionally led a blocking minority of free-traders including 
Germany, the Netherlands and sometimes Denmark against a 
protectionist camp led by France and Spain. 
  Yet the line-up on such issues is far from clear: Germany 
wobbled during last year's General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade negotiations to appease the French government over 
protection for agriculture; but the entry of the Scandinavians 
ought technically to strengthen the free-trading club in the 
Union. 
  Other British arguments on the blocking minority risk 
sounding defeatist. Officials fret about the threat of being 
outmanoeuvred on social policy. But this suggests that the 
much-vaunted opt-out of the social charter which Mr Major 
secured during the Maastricht negotiations, may not be as 
effective as first thought. It underlines, too, how the prime 
minister's vulnerability at home is affecting British 
negotiating tactics in Brussels. 
  UK officials confirm there was a "political calculation" in 
London that a change in the blocking minority could provoke a 
revolt by Tory Euro-sceptics. There were worries about a split 
in the party ahead of the European parliamentary elections in 
June in which the Conservatives are expected to suffer heavy 
losses, possibly provoking a leadership challenge to Mr Major in 
the autumn. 
  Yet diplomats agree that Britain's stand on the blocking 
minority may have the perverse effect of arousing the Tory 
right: an arcane Euro-squabble has been elevated into a cause 
celebre, making a climb-down this week or next harder than it 
might have been. 
  Virtually none of these arguments impress Britain's European 
partners. Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands are upset that 
the UK seems oblivious to the risk that the European parliament 
will block the enlargement agreements if the voting weights are 
not adjusted. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is said to be crestfallen 
at Mr Major's equivocation on enlargement. German officials 
complain that the Chancellor has had no reward for standing by 
Mr Major during ratification of the Maastricht treaty, or for 
agreeing in 1992 to extend the British budgetary rebate to 1999, 
a concession worth almost 2bn pounds a year. 
  German nervousness is compounded by Britain's argument that 
voting weights need to take greater account of the size of 
population. The logic points to Germany, with 80 million 
people, moving up from 10 to 15 votes; but this would end the 
voting parity between France and Germany, undermining the 
Franco-German partnership which in the post war period has 
depended on a delicate balance of political power. 
  The more conspiratorially-minded believe weakening the 
Paris-Bonn axis is Britain's "great game" in Europe. French 
officials routinely state that the UK aim in freezing voting 
weights at their present level is to paralyse decision-making 
inside the Union and create a "wider Europe" which is little 
more than a free trade area. "Major is trying to bring back 
Maggie's Europe," says one senior Brussels diplomat. 
  None of this may be true. It is possible that the British 
are simply putting down a marker ahead of the 1996 
inter-governmental conference to review the operation of the 
Maastricht treaty, signalling that they intend to protect 
vigorously the interests of the larger member states in an 
expanded Union. But the risk is that if sufficient numbers of Mr 
Major's EU partners believe the opposite, they may well be 
tempted to move faster toward integration. He would then face 
the choice he is desperate to avoid: splitting his Tory party or 
swimming with the continental tide.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stupide Albion"] </F>
  [Text] Mr John Major's government is lurching towards 
another pothole. The foreign secretary, long regarded as the 
Cabinet's "safe pair of hands," has landed Mr Major with a new 
political drama which again threatens to divide his party. 
  The enlargement of the European Union [EU] to admit Austria, 
Norway, Finland and Sweden was not a purely British idea. But 
Mr Major had pushed it, especially during the UK presidency in 
1992 against the reticence if not outright opposition of several 
other member states, and had insisted on giving it priority over 
various other tasks, including notably the reform of the EU's 
decision-making process. 
  Two weeks ago this policy appeared close to a deserved 
success. After hard negotiations agreements with three of the 
applicants were concluded, and that with Norway appeared very 
close. Yet now the whole enterprise is in jeopardy because the 
UK, of all countries, is pressing for a change in the qualified 
majority voting system -- reducing the "blocking minority" in 
the EU Council from 30 to 25 percent. 
  Of course, that is not how the British Government presents 
the matter. By stressing the absolute number of votes, as 
opposed to the percentage, it poses as defender of the status 
quo against yet another onslaught by wild-eyed continental 
federalists. At present, says Mr Douglas Hurd, two large states 
and one small one form a blocking minority, and that must remain 
the case even when there are 16 member states altogether. 
<H5>  Trumpet Call </H5>
  By putting it like that he gets the worst of all worlds. 
Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers have been roused by his 
anti-federalist trumpet call, so that the government cannot now 
accept the obvious and rational solution to the problem -- which 
is to keep the percentage as it is until the whole matter is 
reviewed at the Maastricht revision conference in 1996 -- 
without provoking yet another crisis over Europe within the 
Conservative party. So far from showing a safe pair of hands, 
Mr Hurd has used his left hand to sabotage the efforts of his 
right, with which he has been trying to hold the party together 
on Europe as the European elections approach. 
  At the same time he has yet again presented his EU partners 
with the image of Britain as a negative, obstructive force, bent 
on blocking any kind of reform or advance, even one which it 
purports to favour. If he does not back down the result will be 
either to abort the enlargement process altogether -- if the 
European parliament goes through with its threatened veto -- or 
to make enlargement a prescription for even greater paralysis in 
EU decision-making, as the majority required for a decision will 
be greater than before. 
<H5>  Voting Weights </H5>
  Moreover, he has argued his case in such a way as to bring 
forward the issue of the relationship between voting weights and 
population. Small states are overrepresented in the present 
system, for a reason that should command the British 
Government's sympathy: the EU is an association of sovereign 
states, not a federation. Yet the British foreign office has 
been hinting that it might accept a compromise whereby the 
"blocking minority" would vary according to the combined 
population of the states composing it. 
  Such a solution would be a significant step towards 
federalism since it would amount to saying that the Union is 
composed of individual citizens -- who should be equally 
represented in its institutions on the basis of one person one 
vote -- rather than of states with equal sovereign rights 
irrespective of their population. 
  That federalist principle is already acknowledged in the 
fact 
that small and large states have different voting weights. But 
the more precisely voting weights are aligned with population, 
the stronger the federal character of the Union becomes, and the 
weaker the sovereignty of the member states. The Germans, who 
as the state with the largest population stand to benefit most 
from such a reform, have none the less held back from pushing 
it: They can see the danger of invoking their superior numbers 
as a reason for having more influence in the Union than the 
French. 
  But Britain's gallant defenders of national sovereignty have 
blundered in where German federalists feared to tread.

  [Excerpts] Detroit (DPA) -- In the view of Economics 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt, of the Free Democratic Party of 
Germany, new programs to stimulate the economy are not offering 
a way out of the crisis on the German labor market. All efforts 
to solve high unemployment must focus on structural changes, 
"since, even after the solution of the economic problems, 
unemployment will remain," albeit at a lower level. This was 
stated by Rexrodt on Monday [14 March] before the beginning of 
the first employment conference of the seven major 
industrialized nations (G-7) in Detroit, Michigan. 
  Only "a steady economic policy," which is aimed at improving 
the conditions for competition, easing the cost burden on the 
enterprises, more flexibility on the labor market, and further 
privatization, can create "larger room for creating new jobs," 
Finance Minister Theo Waigel, of the Christian Social Union, 
said. The two-day G-7 conference, which will be attended by 
Germany, the United States, Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, 
and Canada, was to be opened at noon (local time) by U.S. 
President Clinton. [passage omitted] 
  During a breakfast with President Clinton and the labor, 
economic, and finance ministers of the G-7, Waigel emphasized 
that the world could not expect any "patent prescriptions" from 
the conference. "The alarming situation on the labor market" is 
a worldwide, and especially a European problem and it is "the 
result of technological developments, structural inflexibility, 
and the revolutionary changes in connection with the lifting of 
the Iron Curtain." Solutions can, therefore, not be achieved in 
the short term, Waigel concluded.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- It is now up to Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl to decide in 
what form the last Russian soldiers will be sent off at the end 
of August. "That is now up to the bosses," Defense Minister 
Volker Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union, said on Friday 
[11 March] in Berlin at the conclusion of a three-day visit to 
Germany by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev. The Russian 
defense minister said that the Russians want to be sent off as 
partners and friends. 
  On Friday, Grachev visited a Bundeswehr unit in Brandenburg. 
Accompanied by Minister Ruehe, he was observing an exercise of 
soldiers of an armored infantry battalion and a motorized 
infantry battalion at the Lehnin training area. Afterwards the 
two ministers laid wreaths at the Soviet memorial and the 20 
July 1944 memorial. Thus, for the first time a Russian 
politician has honored the heroes of the German resistance of 20 
July 1944 by laying a wreath. 
  The Bundeswehr and the Russian Army intend to cooperate more 
closely in the future in the areas of environmental protection 
at the level of Armed Forces and the exchange of officers. 
Agreements to this effect were signed by the two ministers on 
Friday. In a first stage, three Russian officers should study 
at the Bundeswehr's command and control academy in Hamburg and 
one German colonel at the Moscow military academy. In addition, 
joint navy exercises were agreed for this year in the Baltic 
Sea. Plans for 1995 include the participation of German 
soldiers in an exercise in Russia.

  [Excerpt] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) does not see any alternative 
to continuing support for the reform forces in the East, "as 
they are represented by (Russia's) President Boris Yeltsin." In 
a discussion in the Bundestag on Friday [11 March] about aid to 
the reform democracies in the East, Kinkel stressed "the Federal 
Government's pioneering role." By providing almost 90 billion 
German marks [DM] so far to the countries on the territory of 
the former Soviet Union, it has provided more than half of the 
entire international aid and is surpassed only by the United 
States. In contrast, Japan has spent DM46 million. 
  Kinkel said that German aid to the Central European reform 
states (except the CIS) has amounted to about 37.5 billion since 
the end of 1989. He advocated accepting Russia as an equal 
member into the G-7 groups of the large industrialized 
countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The chairman of the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU], Chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as the 
CDU's leading bodies have decided that Christian Wulff, the 
CDU's top candidate in the elections in Lower Saxony, is to take 
over the role of the opposition leader in the Landtag in 
Hannover. After the meeting of CDU Presidium and Executive 
Committee, Kohl told journalists in Bonn on Monday [14 March] 
that Wulff had conducted an excellent and dedicated election 
campaign and had achieved an excellent personal election result. 
In the CDU's leading bodies everyone thinks that Wulff should 
consistently use his opportunities in the group leadership in 
the Lower Saxony Landtag. 
  Kohl admitted that the decline in the number of votes for 
the 
CDU by 5.6 percent is a "serious loss" for his party. It "is no 
consolation" that the predictions were even worse. "This is a 
defeat." Concerning the results achieved by the Free Democratic 
Party of Germany [FDP], Kohl said the fact that FDP land 
chairman had changed his statement on the coalition a few days 
before the elections was certainly one of the mistakes that 
threw the FDP out of the Landtag. 
  In the view of the CDU chairman, the election result as a 
whole refuted the "stupid talk that the Germans are all on the 
point...of refusing to vote." The predictions of an attitude of 
refusal were wrong. The predictions of an end of the large 
people's parties are similarly incorrect. It is highly 
gratifying that the Republikaner remained far below their own 
expectations with only 3.7 percent, Kohl stated.

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- With a call for more 
self-confidence, the congress of the Party of Democratic 
Socialism [PDS] was concluded in Berlin on Sunday evening [13 
March]. "We are the fresh wind from the left in this country," 
PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky said at the conclusion of the party 
congress with more than 430 delegates present. He called on the 
party members to support the PDS candidates for the Bundestag 
and European elections. Before that, the program for the 
Bundestag and European elections had been adopted by a vast 
majority of the delegates with few votes against. The PDS placed 
Honorary Chairman Hans Modrow first on their federal list for 
the European elections. A program for the European elections 
with a call for a change of the course of European unification 
that has been taken so far was also adopted.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- In the view of the Federal Economics 
Ministry, the west German economy will have overcome the 
recession by the end of March. In the first quarter of 1994, 
the real gross domestic product of the old laender will increase 
again over the same period of the previous year for the first 
time since the end of 1992, the ministry stated Tuesday [15 
March] in its monthly economic report. Despite the 0.5-percent 
decline from the third to the fourth quarter of 1993, economic 
activities have overcome the lowest point. 
  The last time the west German GDP achieved a real plus (0.9 
percent) compared to the same three-months period of the 
previous year was in the fourth quarter of 1992. In 1993, the 
decline in the first quarter was 3.4 percent but diminished in 
the course of the year to 1.9, 1.4, and finally 0.9 percent in 
the last quarter.

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- In January, the money 
supply grew even more strongly than assumed: The monetary stock 
grew at an annual rate of 21.2 percent. By announcing this, the 
Bundesbank revised upward the preliminary value of 20.6 percent, 
which it had published at the beginning of March. 
  For 1994 the Bundesbank is aiming for a money supply growth 
between 4 and 6 percent. In particular the strong expansion of 
loans as well as some "special factors" contributed to the 
unusually strong expansion of M3 -- this includes cash in 
circulation, sight deposits, time deposits with maturities of 
less than four years, and savings deposits -- in January.

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- According to preliminary 
calculations, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn) increased its 
sales by 8.3 percent to 58.5 billion German marks [DM] in 1993. 
"All our various branches contributed to this gratifying growth 
rate," Helmut Ricke, chairman of the board of directors, said in 
Hannover on Monday [14 March]. "According to the currently 
available figures, we have before-tax revenues of more than DM5 
billion, which is fully passed on to the Federal Government." 
Upon inquiry by DPA, it was said that there "will certainly not 
be any profit" shown in the balance sheet. One can once again 
expect compensation payment to the sister companies, but one 
cannot yet say anything about that. 
  For 1994 Telekom expects another increase in sales by 8 
percent to DM63 billion. By the year 2000 business is to be 
expanded to DM80 billion and the number of employees is to be 
reduced by 30,000 to about 200,000. This year 3,500 employees 
are to be dismissed, which will increase productivity. 
  Four years before the end of the telephone monopoly, Ricke 
drew up a positive interim balance sheet: "We have made a lot 
of progress on the path from an authority to a market- and 
customer-oriented company." The number of telephone hook-ups 
rose from 35.4 million to about 37 million last year. The 
number of cable hook-ups rose from 11.8 million in 1992 to 13.5 
million in 1993. Regarding the use of ISDN [integrated services 
digital network] networks, Telekom "occupies first place 
internationally," Ricke said. The number of channels, with 
which language as well as text and pictures can be transmitted 
in one network, has almost doubled from 600,000 to more than 1 
million in 1993. 
  By the turn of the century Telekom plans to have all analog 
systems replaced with digital ones. The exchange will be 
concluded six years earlier than planned. The average Telekom 
customer need not expect any price increases. Telekom plans to 
enter the Asian-Pacific market with representations in Singapore 
and Beijing. The transformation into a shareholding company 
will probably be postponed by four months to January 1995, 
according to Ricke. In 1996 at the latest Telekom wants to go 
to the stock exchange.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Real, Not Paper Economy in Detroit, </F>
Italy Says"] 
  [Text] Detroit, 13 Mar (ANSA) -- The Group of Seven summit 
of labour and economics ministers opening here Monday [14 March] 
was billed by Italian officials here today as the first G-7 
meeting ever convened "on the real, rather than the paper 
economy" and one they hope will lead to moves to ensure a fairer 
spread of new technologies in the world. The reference was to 
previous summits and meetings in which the leading seven 
industrial powers have put their names to declarations urging 
certain macro-economic targets or generic forms of economic 
convergence. 
  Here in Detroit, however, the whole agenda revolves round 
the 
very real question of what should be done about workers whose 
qualifications are now becoming irrelevant as their jobs are 
eliminated by technological advance. 
  According to Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, 
however, macro-economic policies concerning interest rates and 
so on should not lose sight of objectives such as balanced 
growth and tangible advantages for those who work in the various 
economies. Following this line of thinking, Italy will be using 
the conference to urge the G-7 to create a task force "on the 
problems of the real economy," one Italian official disclosed. 
  Filling in the background to the Italian position, the 
official said there must be improvements in real cooperation 
between the G-7 nations in all fields and sectors. At the same 
time, budget adjustments needed to fight inflation should not be 
seen as a justification for "indiscriminate cuts in welfare." 
  According to this official, the G-7 must seek to develop 
policies and institutions to ensure a balanced spread of new 
technologies and improvements in efficiency to "reduce the 
inequities of international trade." 
  "One question is to avoid one area such as the United States 
being in the middle of an economic boom when another area such 
as Europe is still getting to grips with the recession," said 
Labour Minister Gino Giugni. He also argued for a new European 
Union pact to avoid discharging the costs of convergence between 
the European economies onto the "real economy," with an 
increasing gap between welfare and the indicators for the real 
economy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi Complains to President </F>
About Magistrates"] 
  [Text] Rome, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- [Forza Italia leader] Silvio 
Berlusconi has filed an official statement with President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro complaining of the judicial handling of 
investigations into Berlusconi's Fininvest media and publishing 
empire, the president's office announced Saturday [12 March]. 
  Scalfaro has forwarded Berlusconi's complaint to the self- 
governing disciplinary body of the judiciary, the Higher Council 
of Magistrates (CSM), of which Scalfaro is also chairman, a 
presidential communique said. 
  The statement, drawn up by Berlusconi and his lawyers, has 
not been made public but was prompted by recent requests from 
public prosecutors in Milan for arrest warrants for six top 
Fininvest executives, including Marcello dell'Utri, who heads 
the Publitalia '80 advertising giant. 
  Berlusconi yesterday said he was writing to the president to 
raise a problem concerning judges' conduct. "The fact is, you 
cannot apply different criteria for different people. For 
certain political parties, enquiries are being shelved or put 
off. For others, on the other hand, enquiries are being stepped 
up, putting hard-working groups in the stocks." 
  Berlusconi's decision to write to the head of state was 
called into question by Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco 
Saverio Borrelli who in a television interview said Berlusconi 
was "going about things totally in the wrong way." 
  Borrelli noted that neither the president nor the CSM have 
the power to intervene in judicial enquiries or measures taken 
by judges in court cases. "They have disciplinary duties but we 
are very far away from hypotheses which involve the aspect of 
disciplining magistrates," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefania Tamburello: "Giugni: 600,000 Jobs"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Rome -- One should not expect a miracle. For 
Labor Minister Gino Giugni, the grave problem of unemployment 
will lessen if growth picks up and if flexibility is introduced 
into the labor market. Giugni was leaving for Detroit to take 
part in the summit of the 7 most industrialized countries (G-7), 
devoted entirely to employment. He is flying to the United 
States with a recipe under his arms: "Italy," he says openly, 
"is going to the summit with an original contribution. We 
believe that the problem of employment should be confronted 
either in macroeconomic terms or in terms of labor market 
intervention based on social consensus. An objective which we 
achieved in the July accord." The Minister explains: "If in 
the coming five years Italy is able to attain an economic growth 
of 3 percent, it will be possible to create 600,000 new jobs 
every year. Not many, certainly, but one can do more only by 
adopting policies of labor flexibility, and by achieving 
transparency of the hidden sector. In this way it will be 
possible to achieve European Commissioner Jacques Delors' 
objective of 3 million jobs." 
  In the meantime, Finance Minister and progressive list 
candidate Luigi Spaventa has launched a new and concrete 
proposal: an extraordinary three-year plan to invest 30 trillion 
lira, concentrated in the transport, telecommunications, and 
environmental sectors. The project, to be financed by 
fixed-rate long-term securities issued through an appropriate 
agency and guaranteed by the state, would increase employment -- 
300,000 jobs, Spaventa forecasts -- and would raise GDP (gross 
domestic product) by 1 percent a year. Investments, economic 
growth, and flexibility. But industrialists are asking for an 
additional effort to liberalize the labor market. "Development, 
which is necessary, is not enough on its own," Confindustria 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry] Director General 
Innocenzo Cipolletta stated. The July accord represents an 
income policy which has proved particularly effective for Italy. 
But one must push more for the liberalization of the labor 
market: Instruments such as part-time work and short-term 
contracts exist, but are exceptions. If, now that we are at the 
beginning of a positive phase in the economic cycle there were 
to be greater liberty, we will be able to create new jobs at a 
speed which is unknown in our country, but which is known, on 
the other hand, in America. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Prosecutor Confirms Journalists in </F>
Ferruzzi Pay"] 
  [Text] Milan, 13 Mar (ANSA) -- Three journalists reported 
in this morning's press as having received off-the-records 
payments from the Ferruzzi agro-industrial empire were named in 
a statement by ex-Ferruzzi chief Carlo Sama, Milan's chief 
prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli confirmed Sunday [13 
March]. 
  "No one else is named," Borrelli added, as he confirmed the 
reports that Giuseppe Turani of LA REPUBBLICA, Osvaldo de 
Paolini IL SOLE-24 ORE, and Ugo Bertone of LA STAMPA were named 
by Sama. 
  Sama presented himself to magistrates last week to discuss 
payments made to journalists in order to ensure favourable press 
coverage for the Ferruzzi empire, after financier Sergio Cusani, 
on trial in Milan, confirmed that large sums had been put aside 
by Ferruzzi for this purpose, but refused to name the 
journalists involved. 
  The chief prosecutor said he will now be consulting his 
assistants to gauge whether the journalists' case is a criminal 
or disciplinary one. If it is disciplinary, "we would simply 
pass on the documentation...and the three journalists would not 
even be called in for questioning." At that point, the order of 
journalists, which oversees the profession, would step in and 
could strike the three off its list of members. 
  In statements issued this morning, the three journalists 
named by Sama strongly denied the press reports, which at the 
time had not received confirmation from Borrelli. Claiming 
always to have worked "in complete honesty, and correctly," 
Turani said "I categorically exclude ever having received sums 
of money from Carlo Sama." 
  Turani, an economic journalist who said he would be stepping 
down as editorialist of the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA until his 
name is cleared, said that his journalism is proof "of total 
independence and intransigence with regard to all industrial 
groups, including Ferruzzi." 
  Ugo Bertone, head of the Milan bureau of the Turin daily LA 
STAMPA stated "I have never taken, either directly or 
indirectly, a lire from him (Sama), from the Ferruzzi group or 
from Montedison." In a comment to the press, Bertone added "I 
think I have written one article about Sama in the last two 
years. According to him I receive 100 million lire (60,000 
dollars) for this. That's the kind of money a Pulitzer prize 
winner gets, and I am not one of those." 
  De Paolini also denied having received money "from Carlo 
Sama 
or anyone acting for him, either in relation to the family 
project nor to any other project linked to the image of the 
Ferruzzis or Montedison." 
  Sama alleged that sums were paid out to journalists to 
enhance the image of the Ferruzzi family after its acrimonious 
split with brother-in-law Raul Gardini, who ran the Ferruzzi 
empire and its Montedison division until 1991. 
  De Paolini, who has appealed against a journalists' order 
decision to expel him for alleged insider trading, challenged 
Sama to come up with proof of the under-the-counter payments. 
  Later in the day, Bertone, in charge of LA STAMPA's Milan 
bureau, said he was taking leave as the newspaper's union 
representatives issued a communique in which the editorial staff 
voiced "full confidence in the work of the judiciary and 
confidence that full clarity will be quickly brought to the 
`clean pens' case."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ilva Labor Agreement on Cutting </F>
12,000 Jobs"] 
  [Text] Rome, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- Ilva, the loss-making steel 
producer 100 percent owned by the public sector holding company 
IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction], and trade unions 
today signed an agreement on a restructurization plan for 
1994-95 which calls for the elimination of a maximum of 12,517 
jobs out of workforce of 45,000 over the coming three years. 
  "This is an important accord," said Salvatore Biondo of the 
FIM [Italian Federation of Metal workers and Mechanics] 
steelworkers union who reported, "It was reached with difficulty 
because in play at the same time is restructurization, break-up 
and privatization." 
  Another union spokesman, Maurizio Micolia of the UILM 
[Italian Metal Workers Union], said the agreement reached with 
the mediation of Labor Minister Gino Giugni, "confirms an 
important philosophy for negotiations, that is, this accord will 
be inherited by the private- sector buyers as a special clause 
in the sales contracts." 
  Luigi Portioli of the FIOM [Federation of Employees and 
Workers in the Metallurgical Industry] said the agreement was 
"undoubtedly costly but certainly effective. We hope that Ilva 
will be sold to a big national steel business capable of 
assuring international cooperation." 
  Most of the workers whose jobs are targeted in the new plan, 
10,450, will receive early retirement with benefits to be 
written into an updated Labor Ministry law degree. According to 
the labor side, early retirement costs will come to 1.8 billion 
lire (1.07 billion dollars), to be added to expenditures for 
other social safety nets for the additional jobs losses.

<F P=106> [Article by Georgina Higueras] </F>
  [Text] Iraq's dramatic situation has led its government to 
approach certain "friendly countries" to supply it with food and 
medical supplies. The bill would be paid at the end of the 
embargo decreed by the United Nations after the invasion of 
Kuwait on 2 August 1990. "For the moment, importing Spanish 
medical supplies in the amount of 1.45 billion pesetas would be 
sufficient to meet our needs," said Iraqi Minister of Health 
Umid Midhat Mubarak in an interview with this newspaper. "We are 
optimistic with respect to Iraq's future, but now we need our 
friends. As the Orientals that we are, we never forget those who 
are with us in difficult moments," Mubarak added. 
  Although the UN embargo allows Iraq to import medicines and 
other civil goods essential for the population, the prohibition 
against oil exports leaves Iraq without the hard currency needed 
to pay for such imports. The funds that were frozen in several 
Western countries under the embargo--with the exception of those 
related to oil and its derivatives, which were transferred into 
a UN account--have been slowly unfrozen to pay for exports of 
goods of humanitarian nature, and in many cases these funds have 
been exhausted. 
  According to Mubarak, there are more than 1.5 billion 
pesetas 
still frozen in Spain. The Iraqi Embassy in Spain reduces that 
figure to "some 300 million pesetas," belonging to two Iraqi 
banks. And Jose Ramon Baranano, assistant director of the 
Spanish Foreign Ministry's International Economic Relations 
Section, asserts that Iraq "now has not a single frozen peseta 
left in Spain." 
<H5>  Searching for Formulas </H5>
  With or without funds, what the Iraqi government suggests is 
that Spain "find formulas, because they do exist, to prevent 
suffering by the Iraqi population." "We do not want to 
manufacture weapons, we want to keep people from dying," asserts 
the minister of health. 
  Data compiled by UNICEF are hair-raising: Infant mortality 
has tripled; 80 percent of the children are born with less than 
normal weight because of the mother's malnutrition. Hospital 
occupancy has dropped to approximately 30 percent. "Without 
medical supplies, people do better remaining home." And of the 
200 ambulances existing in 1990, only 37 throughout the country 
are in operation. "We have run out of tires and batteries, and 
as one breaks down, we use its parts to fix another." 
  The Spanish Government says that it "understands" Iraq's 
problems, but argues that the Security Council allows no margin 
of maneuver whatever, forbidding any type of credit, even if it 
is for humanitarian reasons. Diplomatic sources assert: "We are 
complying with UN regulations, and we hope that Iraq continues 
to show its willingness to cooperate, as it has been doing 
lately, so that the embargo may be lifted the soonest possible." 
  Fearing that the United States may veto the lifting of the 
embargo even though it may be fulfilling the requirements of UN 
resolution 687 (forbidding Iraq to sell oil until the UN 
ascertains the dismantling of its mass-destruction arsenal, and 
to install an anti-arms warning system), Baghdad meanwhile is 
seeking alternatives and is offering "large future 
compensations" to those enterprises that may take the chance of 
"delivering today and collecting tomorrow." 
  "We have already signed some substantial agreements with 
several European enterprises. Spanish companies should not lose 
this opportunity to cash in on lucrative profits in a not too 
distant future," says Umid Midhat Mubarak.

<F P=106> [Interview with Joan Reventos, president of the Senate's </F>
General Committee for the Autonomous Communities, by Luis R. 
Aizpeolea; place and date not given: "The Senate Must Totally 
Change Its Role"] 
  [Text] On 2 February, Joan Reventos, 66 years of age, 
was appointed president of the Senate's General Committee for 
the Autonomous Communities. The veteran Catalan Socialist 
politician will thus head the experiment aimed at transforming 
the Senate into a Chamber of the Autonomous Communities. 
  The Senate has just created a new entity, a Committee for 
the 
Autonomous Communities. Its objective is to test the 
possibilities of transforming the Senate into a Chamber of the 
Autonomous Communities. The Parliamentary parties have embraced 
the experiment, although the nationalist parties have expressed 
some reservations. 
  [Aizpeolea] What will this Committee contribute to the 
Senate 
and to the development of the State of the Autonomous 
Communities? 
  [Reventos] Its contribution can be fundamental, an authentic 
turning point in the operation of the Senate, which, in the long 
term, could be transformed into a Chamber of the Territories or 
of the Autonomous Communities. This Committee will be unique, 
first, in that the autonomous governments and the national 
government can all share representation with the senators, 
within the same body. The number of senators will be double 
those of other committees. And secondly it will be unique in 
that this Committee will actually be a Parliament in which 
important matters relative to the autonomous communities will be 
discussed, and which in this respect will serve to lower 
tensions in the State of the Autonomous Communities. 
  [Aizpeolea] The Committee for the Autonomous Communities did 
not have a good start. On 2 February, the day it was 
established, the representative of the PNV [Basque Nationalist 
Party] relinquished his seat on the Committee, because he 
considers that the Committee diluted the distinctiveness of the 
autonomous communities. 
  [Reventos] It is true that the PNV representative, Ricardo 
Sanz, has left the Committee, but it is also true that he has 
associated himself with the joint work of the Senate's Executive 
and Chamber Business Committees and that he is contributing his 
ideas to that work. Everything new arouses interest and 
reservations. But the results of the work done in the Committee 
for the Autonomous Communities will be arrived at strictly by 
consensus. 
  [Aizpeolea] The nationalist parties--the PNV and the CiU 
[Convergence and Union]--fear that this Committee may be a 
maneuver to shrink bilateral relations with the State central 
government, to which the autonomous community governments, 
headed by nationalists, want to accord primacy. 
  [Reventos] At this point in time, bilateral relations 
between 
the central government and the autonomous governments are 
irreplaceable, and their elimination would be a fiasco. The 
Committee will be the body in which matters of common interest 
to the autonomous communities will be debated. The Committee 
must bring diverse volitions together and inspire confidence on 
matters that may attract the interest of the autonomous 
communities. 
  [Aizpeolea] What matters of common interest to the 
autonomous 
communities may be debated in the Committee? 
  [Reventos] The application of European Community guidelines 
affecting the autonomous communities, agreements that affect two 
or more communities, and issues that by force of attraction 
affect all of them. A clear example is the transfer of 15 
percent of the IRPF [Personal Income Tax] revenue to the 
autonomous communities. Had there been a Committee for the 
Autonomous Communities, it would have been the proper body in 
which to hold the debate. 
  [Aizpeolea] What is currently the Committee's first action? 
  [Reventos] The reform of the 11 so-called slow-track 
statutes. In committee, we have heard the representatives of the 
Legislative Assemblies of the autonomous communities, and the 
reform will go to the plenary session of the Committee for the 
Autonomous Communities on 1 March. 
  [Aizpeolea] What is to be the Committee's task from now 
until 
summer? 
  [Reventos] The Committee has the task of rendering an 
opinion 
on matters relating to autonomies that may come before the 
Chamber. Between now and June we will hold two general meetings 
on the State of Autonomous Communities, one at the plenary 
session of the Committee and the other at the plenary session of 
the Senate. The presidents of the autonomous community 
governments will be present at both meetings. 
  [Aizpeolea] Do you think those meetings will indeed be 
attended by the presidents of the autonomous governments, or 
rather by their representatives assigned to this Committee? 
  [Reventos] The president of the Senate has addressed the 
presidents of all the autonomous communities and proposed to 
them individual or collective talks. I, too, am willing to 
travel anywhere and everywhere I may be called, to explain the 
importance of this Committee. To date, we have not received a 
single negative response. 
  [Aizpeolea] Do you think that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
will come to the Committee to debate with the presidents of 
communities on the State of Autonomous Communities? With 
Ardanza, Pujol, or Rodriguez Ibarra? 
  [Reventos] Why not? The central government of the State is a 
full-fledged member of the Committee, just as are the autonomous 
governments. There, Felipe Gonzalez can debate on autonomy with 
Ardanza, Pujol, Rodriguez Ibarra, and any other presidents of 
autonomous communities. 
  [Aizpeolea] Is there an external model of the one you are 
testing? With it, are we moving toward federalism? 
  [Reventos] It borrows something from the experience of the 
German Bundesrat and from that of the United States' federal 
formulas. But it also has its own individuality. Therefore, I 
dare not give it a name. The test of its initial phase will 
define it. 
  [Aizpeolea] You are saying that the work of this Committee 
is 
a test to which you cannot give a name. To what can it lead, and 
within what time? 
  [Reventos] If the results of the Committee's initial phase 
are good, the Senate may totally change its role and transform 
itself into a Chamber of the Autonomous Communities. This would 
require that the Constitution be amended. And with that, the 
role of the Congress would be redefined. But I do not wish to 
set time limits. We intend to take it step by step.

  [Text] Geneva, March 14 (AFP) -- The UN's Human Rights 
Commission [UNHRC] should have new powers to punish 
uncooperative states and promote democracy, rather than just 
react to past violations, its president said Monday [14 March]. 
  Speaking to journalists at the end of the Commission's 
annual 
six-week session, Dutch diplomat Pieter van Wulfften Palthe 
demanded reforms to enable the Commission to encourage 
"democratisation in the world" rather than "look towards the 
past." 
  A working group would try to reform the Commission during 
1994 to make it more "relevant to the outside world" and cut 
down on "long reports and speeches," he told a press conference. 
  The Commission should also deal "in a much stronger way" 
with 
states that refused to cooperate with human rights rapporteurs 
and the UN system generally, such as Iraq, Iran, Cuba, and Sudan. 
  "The one thing international law lacks is sanctions," said 
Palthe. "It is the same with the Commission on Human Rights 
(...) Unfortunately there are no sanctions mechanisms," he 
commented. 
  He singled out Sudan, which had denounced as "blasphemy 
against Islam" a critical report by special UN human rights 
rapporteur Gaspar Biro. 
  "The Sudanese attacks against Mr. Biro are quite 
unacceptable. I'm glad the Commission condemned this unwarranted 
attack," he said. 
  The group's 53 member states had acknowledged the changes in 
South Africa but had not shown enough recognition of the Middle 
East peace process, he said. 
  The disputed Indonesian territory of East Timor had been 
less 
controversial this year because of Jakarta's cooperation, but 
India and Pakistan had "abused the Commission's time" by their 
long debates on the "highly political" question of Kashmir. 
  "The Commission is not a place for bilateral disputes," he 
commented. 
  Palthe said he would be appointing someone within the next 
few weeks to take up the newly created post of special 
rapporteur on violence against women, who would then be 
confirmed by UN headquarters in New York this June.

  [Text] The European Union [EU] will evaluate the progress 
of efforts toward a solution of the Cyprus issue in January 1995 
based on the report of its observer [Serge Abou] and 
irrespective of whether or not the UN secretary general assigns 
blame to the interested parties. This was stated by EU Foreign 
Affairs Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek during the EU-Cyprus 
joint parliamentary committee meeting in Brussels. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Speaking 
during the committee's meeting, EU Commissioner Van Den Broek 
said that the European Union supports the confidence-building 
measures and in the fourth financial protocol it is preparing 
for Cyprus, it is providing a special chapter on their 
implementation. Van Den Broek said that he will visit Cyprus on 
24 March. The Dutch commissioner said that it is uncertain if a 
solution could be found quickly. The EU Council of Ministers, 
he added, should evaluate the stance of the interested parties 
at the beginning of January 1995 and based on this evaluation 
should evaluate Cyprus' application for accession. The EU 
Council of Ministers' decision, he said, will be based on the EU 
observer's report irrespective of whether or not the UN 
secretary general assigns blame to the interested parties. 
  Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis stressed that it is 
very 
clear that the Turkish side is looking for ways to abandon the 
process or, at least through time-consuming discussions, make 
the process ineffective. 
  [Mikhailidhis] Despite all this, our side will continue full 
cooperation with the UN secretary general and his 
representatives. We are ready to discuss in a constructive way, 
with goodwill, and within the assigned timeframe in hope that 
such an agreement will be possible with the European Union's 
precious support. [end recording]

  [Text] Florence, Italy, March 12 (AFP) -- Prime Minister 
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi opened an environmental meeting of the 
seven richest industrialized nations here Saturday [12 March] 
warning that population growth increasingly threatened the 
world's ecology. 
  "When one thinks that one-tenth of the world population, 
concentrated in the G7 countries, consumes about two-thirds of 
the available energy, it is easy to imagine what a destructive 
effect the pressure of a growing population has on the 
environment and rare resources," Ciampi said. 
  "If the developing countries go on, in an uncontrolled 
manner, to achieve the same level of consumption as us, how many 
other planets will we need in addition to Earth?" he added. 
  Environment ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Japan, Italy, and the United States are attending the two-day 
meeting.

  [Text] Florence, Italy, March 13 (AFP) -- Environmental 
protection schemes could provide jobs for more than two million 
people in the recession-hit seven most industrialized countries, 
their environmental ministers said here Sunday [13 March]. 
  At an informal meeting, held unusually ahead of a summit of 
the G7 countries scheduled for July, the ministers said they 
were convinced environmental projects could generate 2.1 million 
jobs in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the 
United States. 
  They agreed that preservation of nature could be financed by 
"environmental accounting" or better distribution of taxes. 
  "No one talked about creating new taxes," said Italian 
Environmental Minister Valdo Spini at the end of the two-day 
meeting. 
  French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said Europe must 
"implement such reforms together," noting that "pollution has no 
boundaries." 
  On safety at nuclear plants, particularly in Central and 
East 
Europe, the ministers pledged to "promote aid and economic and 
technological assistance to countries with the biggest problems." 
  They also discussed the greenhouse effect -- or warming up 
of 
the earth's climate through pollution -- as well as 
deforestation, desertification and water pollution.

  [Text] Brussels, March 15 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
will not renew its minimum prices on imports of seven fish 
species in the immediate future, a spokesman for the European 
Commission announced on Tuesday [15 March]. 
  The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire 
March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against 
excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set 
for fish last year as well, from February to December. 
  The spokesman said there were no data showing that the 
market 
is destabilized at present by cheap fish imports. But if it is, 
the Commission "is prepared to re-establish the minimum prices". 
  Last week, France asked the Commission to extend the minimum 
prices. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes 
violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU 
countries that drive down prices of French fish. 
  The Commission spokesman said that the general situation on 
the market for fish products and its "structural weaknesses," 
especially in France, will be studied on the basis of a report 
at a fishing ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on April 12.

<F P=106> [Article by Christophe Lamfalussy: "The Irreplaceable Mr. </F>
Dehaene?"] 
  [Text] Jean-Luc Dehaene, whose popularity is far from 
evident, has just benefited from the most effective and least 
costly of promotional campaigns, courtesy of the GUARDIAN 
newspaper. Last Wednesday's edition [9 March] of the British 
daily reported that the Belgian prime minister is Helmut Kohl 
and Francois Mitterrand's preferred candidate to replace Jacques 
Delors. 
  This cannot be verified. Dehaene is surprised, but it is not 
impossible that his name is being considered without his 
knowledge. This kind of appointment, which is settled by the 
heads of state and government of the Twelve, is very insidious. 
There are those who can be encouraged to become candidates. 
And there are also jobs which you do not refuse. 
  Jean-Luc Dehaene owes his experience on the European 
political scene to the term of the Belgian EU presidency. With 
his rough manners, he was not an obvious candidate to impress 
anyone. But, situation after situation the Belgian prime 
minister succeeded in demonstrating his ability to solve crisis 
situations. President Mitterrand in particular is indebted to 
him for having settled the differences between Paris and 
Brussels on the site of the European Parliament. 
  To consequently conclude that he is the Paris candidate, 
however, would be rather hasty. He is no doubt preferred by 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a Christian Democrat, who would like to 
squash at the earliest opportunity the candidacy of Sir Leon 
Brittan, a British conservative who is campaigning as European 
commissioner. 
  There will be much speculation until the European summit in 
Corfu 24-25 June. In the meantime, why not support the 
candidacy of a Belgian as head of the European Commission, even 
if it does mean denying ourselves his services? 
  It is true that the Belgian domestic situation has worsened 
and that Jean-Luc Dehaene brings a certain cohesion and 
stability. But if we are forced to conclude that there is 
nobody in Belgian politics to replace him, we must then also ask 
ourselves what exactly Belgium would be losing, as it would 
greatly benefit from having a Belgian as president of the 
European Commission.

  [Text] Switzerland and France have criticized each other's 
approach to European transport policy. Swiss Transport Minister 
Adolf Ogi said France was being tough on Switzerland by opposing 
Swiss attempts to resume transport negotiations with the 
European Union. Mr Ogi, speaking after talks in Crete with his 
French counterpart Bernard Bosson, said Switzerland would 
nevertheless continue to press its case. 
  Mr Bosson told reporters that Swiss policy was 
contradictory. 
He said Switzerland had voted to ban foreign heavy goods 
traffic from its north-south transit roads, while at the same 
time demanding free access for its own heavy goods vehicles on 
French territory. Mr Ogi and Mr Bosson are in Crete for a 
European transport conference.

<F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] The IRA tonight demanded new direct talks between 
Republicans and the Government. 
  Just hours after accusing the police of gambling with 
peoples' lives over the Heathrow airport mortar attacks, the 
Provisionals said there had to be discussions if there was any 
chance of an end to the violence. 
  The IRA was prepared to be flexible and positive in 
exploring 
potential for moving the peace process forward. But the lines 
of communication between the two sides would have to reopen. 
  In a statement released in Dublin, the IRA said: "The 
continued opportunity for peace should not be squandered. There 
is an urgent need to re-focus attention and to move the peace 
process forward." 
  Although the Provisionals have yet to make a definitive 
response to the Downing St declaration reached between Mr Major 
and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds three months ago, this 
is as close as they have come to acknowledging that the 
agreement clearly is not enough to persuade them to stop their 
campaign. 
  The bomb attacks at Heathrow effectively confirmed that, but 
the terrorists said they were still interested in trying to 
reach a settlement with Britain. 
  Secret contacts between the IRA and the Government stopped 
last November after disclosures that the two sides were in 
discussions. 
  The Provisionals claimed they had been prepared to call a 
fortnight's ceasefire the previous May to try and help reach 
some sort of settlement. 
  But they alleged the Government walked away from the offer 
of 
a truce because of the need for Ulster Unionist support to 
survive the Maastricht vote. 
  Tonight, the IRA tonight said its attitude to the peace 
initiative between the SDLP [Social Democratic Labour Party] 
leader John Hume and Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was 
positive and flexible. It was also abiding and enduring. 
  But there was a responsibility on Britain to move from what 
it described as "its current negative stance." The people of 
Britain and Ireland deserved better, they claimed. 
  The statement said: "We, our supporters and activists have a 
vested interest in achieving a just and lasting peace in 
Ireland. We are prepared to be flexible in exploring the 
potential for peace. All concerned should leave no stone 
unturned. Our objectives which include the recognition and the 
exercise of the Irish people's right to national 
self-determination are well known. Our commitment and our unity 
of purpose remain steadfast."

<F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Government today dramatically slammed the 
door on all overtures for talks with the IRA until their 
campaign of terror is ended for good. 
  And a transatlantic plea by SDLP [Social Democratic Labour 
Party] leader John Hume for ministers to resume negotiations 
with Sinn Fein met with a similar rebuff from Downing Street. 
  The message from the British Government to the men of 
violence was stark and uncompromising in the wake of the three 
terrorist mortar attacks on Heathrow Airport within the space of 
five days and killings in Ulster. Downing Street seemed to 
treat with contempt Mr Hume's implied suggestion that it was in 
the IRA's favour that it was not their intention to detonate any 
of the mortar bombs which rained into Heathrow in the three 
attacks. 
  Mr Hume, who is in Boston, Massachusetts, drumming up 
investment for Ulster, said: "It was their intention to 
demonstrate to the British Government what they are capable of, 
so that if there is a total cessation of violence they are not 
backing down or standing down from a position of weakness, but 
from a position of strength." 
  And he claimed that this was the best opportunity for peace 
in 20 years. 
  But a senior Downing Street source said: "It is deeply 
offensive to people in Ireland and in Britain that the IRA 
should claim to be interested in peace while continuing to kill 
in cold blood and to mount acts of terror. This behaviour will 
only reinforce the Government's resolve to stick with utter 
determination to the course which we have chosen which has huge 
support. We have not been waiting and we are not waiting for 
the IRA in our efforts to achieve a lasting political settlement 
which is acceptable to all the constitutional, democratic 
parties." 
  New top-level talks are planned between Dublin and London on 
security cooperation, amid speculation that a crack-down is on 
the way. 
  The Government continues to say that internment is not ruled 
out, but its imposition could -- some believe -- destroy Albert 
Reynolds, the Irish Premier. 
  Meanwhile, Heathrow was recovering from the chaos created by 
the third attack on Sunday [13 March], and compounded by a 
security shut-down overnight -- an alert which also closed down 
Gatwick for a time. 
  The IRA itself also demanded new direct talks with the 
Government, insisting there had to be discussions if there was 
to be any chance of an end to the violence. They said they were 
prepared to be flexible and positive, but the lines of 
communication between the two sides would have to reopen. 
  But the message from Downing Street was that there was 
absolutely no prospect of resuming negotiations or contact under 
any kind of duress. The IRA overtures are seen by the 
Government as a means of trying to force talks before any 
commitment to end the violence. 
  The IRA came under attack from Mr Reynolds. "This multiple 
attack on Heathrow and indeed the closure of Gatwick is in my 
view a gross miscalculation by the IRA. It is not going to 
advance the peace process and it is certainly not going to do 
anything to endear themselves to the general public." 
  Mr Reynolds, who was speaking in New York, was at one with 
John Major in insisting that the Downing Street declaration was 
unaffected by this latest IRA campaign. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Square One"] </F>
  [Text] The IRA's mortar attacks on Heathrow have made the 
British and Irish Governments look foolish. For months, both 
London and Dublin forbore to impose a deadline for Sinn Fein to 
accept December's Downing Street Declaration. The two 
governments put up with Sinn Fein's obvious prevarication, its 
attempts to start negotiations without renouncing violence, and 
the propaganda advantage which its leader, Gerry Adams, was able 
to garner while the world awaited his response. 
  Repeatedly it was explained that, whatever the provocations 
of Mr Adams, both the Prime Minister and the Irish Taoiseach, Mr 
Reynolds, were prepared to go that extra mile for peace. Now, 
after the Heathrow attacks, they are generally perceived to have 
failed. Sinn Fein has issued a statement demanding talks, 
without accepting the precondition that the IRA should first 
abandon violence. 
  The Downing Street Declaration was accompanied by 
unspecified 
threats of a security clampdown if the IRA spurned its place at 
the conference table. There seemed at least an implication 
that, in such an event, the Irish Republic would at last throw 
its full weight behind new security measures. Now that the IRA 
has called its bluff, that prospect looks remote. The Irish 
have promised to tighten up their extradition law, but little 
else. Internment and the right of hot pursuit across the border 
do not seem to figure even remotely on the Irish agenda, 
although -- as John Keegan discusses on the facing page -- joint 
internment would offer the brightest prospect of ending the 
terrorist campaign. Nor, it seems, are the Irish much 
interested in attempts to make political progress in the absence 
of Sinn Fein. 
  There is little we can do about any of this; the Irish are 
our neighbours and we must live with the limitations of their 
polity. But next time the British Government contemplates a 
joint initiative with its Irish counterpart, it should remember 
that while Dublin is always interested in extracting 
constitutional concessions, it remains unable to deliver its own 
society -- above all its judiciary -- on the key issue of 
security. 
  The only encouraging aspect of the present impasse is that, 
events at Heathrow notwithstanding, Sinn Fein and the IRA also 
look weak. They are clearly divided as to how to respond to the 
Declaration and concerned that it has undermined the will of a 
significant proportion of its supporters, both in the Republic 
and Ulster. Their statement at the weekend contained little of 
the usual bombast; indeed their plea for talks without 
preconditions sounded almost plaintive. They may still mount 
"spectaculars" but their capacity indefinitely to maintain their 
campaign must be in doubt, when many in their ranks think that a 
negotiated deal is available. 
  The terrorist campaign is likely to persist, however, as 
long 
as Sinn Fein believes that British will is uncertain, that 
Dublin is disinclined to tighten the security squeeze, and that 
the distant prospect exists of a better deal from a British 
Labour government. The only course now is to leave the 
Declaration on the table for Sinn Fein to ponder, and meanwhile 
press on with the security struggle against the IRA -- with or 
without increased help from Dublin.

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has 
said that there is a disinformation campaign against India on 
the Kashmir issue. 
  Addressing the Indian community at the Guild Hall in London, 
he said we live in a world in which mastery over technique of 
disinformation creates the possibility of more massive 
disinformation. Mr. Rao regretted that Kashmir valley has been 
a victim of proxy war from across the border. The prime 
minister expressed surprise that a country on the verge of being 
declared a terrorist state should talk of human rights. He 
reiterated India's willingness to resume dialogue with Pakistan 
to resolve the bilateral issues despite the provocative and 
unreasonable attitude of the neighboring country. Mr. Rao said 
if the external factor is removed from Jammu and Kashmir, 
normalcy can be brought back there. He expressed confidence that 
the government will achieve normalcy in Kashmir through the 
time-tested democratic method and commitment to the Indian 
values based on a political and consensual approach. 
  During the one-to-one talk with his British counterpart Mr. 
John Major, Mr. Narasimha Rao said India is very much interested 
in resumption of political process in Jammu and Kashmir even 
though the fear of the gun instigated from across the border 
continues. He told Mr. Major that New Delhi is always in favor 
of a dialogue with Islamabad. Mr. Rao also drew Mr. Major's 
attention to the six concrete proposals put forth by India in 
January. 
  Earlier, India and Britain signed an agreement on the 
promotion and protection of investment. Three other memoranda 
of understanding were also signed in the field of power 
generation, telecommunications, and electrical transformers. 
  Later, in an interview to BBC, Mr. Narasimha Rao expressed 
the hope that the bilateral trade would be further stepped up. 
He said the Indo-British Partnership Initiative has been 
extended by another year so that it can complete its tasks. 
Though it has made significant progress certain things still 
remain to be done, Mr. Rao added.

  [Text] India and Britain have signed an agreement on 
promotion and protection of investments. The agreement was 
signed by the Indian High Commissioner, Dr. L.M. Singhvi, and 
the British foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, in the presence 
of the prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and his British 
counterpart, Mr. John Major in London. Our official 
correspondent, P.J.S. Trehan reports that Britain is the first 
country with which India signs such an agreement. The 10-year 
agreement aims at creating conditions conducive for investment 
in each other's country and is designed to increase investors 
confidence. Three other Memoranda of Understanding -- MOU -- 
have also been signed. The MOU's were signed between the 
private companies of both the countries in power generation, 
telecommunications, and electrical transformers. 
  During his talks with Mr. John Major yesterday, Mr. Rao said 
that India is very much interested in the resumption of the 
political process in Jammu and Kashmir. However, the fear of 
the gun instigated from across the border is continuing in the 
valley. Mr. Rao recalled that the ground work for starting a 
political process in the state has already been initiated. Mr. 
Major, on his part, laid stress on the desirability of a 
dialogue between India and Pakistan. In his reply, Mr. Rao said 
New Delhi is always in favor of such a dialogue. On Mr. Major's 
inquiry about the confidence- building measures with Pakistan, 
Mr. Rao drew his attention to the six concrete proposals put 
forth by India in January last. The two prime minister endorsed 
the continuation of the Indo-British Partnership Intiative -- 
IBPI. Presenting the initiative to the two prime ministers, the 
cochairman, Dr. J.J. Irani of India and Mr. Robert Evans of 
Britain described the initiative as a great success. 
  Addressing the Indian community at the Guild Hall last 
evening, Mr. Narasimha Rao said if the external factor is 
removed from Jammu and Kashmir, normalcy can be restored, the 
political process started, and economic activity revived in a 
very short time. He regretted that the valley has been a victim 
of proxy war from across the border. He said we live in a world 
in which mastery over technique of disinformation creates the 
possibility of more massive disinformation. It should, 
therefore, not come as a surprise to us that made victims of 
terrorism organized and financed from across the border, should, 
sometime, find ourselves subjected to unwarranted criticism, Mr. 
Rao added. [sentence as heard] He said it is strange that the 
world should worry about the human rights of the terrorists who, 
massacre innocent people or use religious places for political 
ends, and not of those who are being forced out of their homes, 
attacked, and terrorized. Mr. Rao expressed surprise that a 
country on the verge of being declared a terrorist state should 
lustily proclaim that it would not have discussions with India 
until the human rights record improved. Mr. Rao reiterated that 
India stands for peace all over the world. Our democracy 
remains not only intact, but also a vibrant and proven force 
overcoming all kinds of disasters and manmade tragedies. 
  On the third day of his visit, Mr. Narasimha Rao will call 
on 
Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace this morning. He will also 
hold talks with the Secretary of State for Foreign and 
Commonwealth affairs, Mr. Douglas Hurd. The Commonwealth 
secretary general, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, is also scheduled to 
call on the prime minister.

  [Text] The prime minister has said that the Indian economy 
is poised for quantum growth and there will be no looking back 
on the economic reform process. Mr. Narasimha Rao declared that 
India will continue with its economic reform programs while 
ensuring that the government does not lose touch with the 
realities and exigencies of development for the vast number of 
underprivileged. Mr. Rao was replying to the toast proposed by 
the British prime minister, Mr. John Major, who hosted a lunch 
in Mr. Rao's honor at 10 Downing Street in London. He said a 
democratic and secular India pursuing economic liberalization is 
keen on tapping the vast potential in Indo-British relationship. 
He observed that during the last two years, Indo-British ties 
had made remarkable progress. The progress has been visible 
since Mr. Major visited New Delhi in January last year. 
  The Indo-British Partnership Initiative, IBPI, was today 
extended by another year. The IBPI was set up in January 1993 
for a period of one year to increase awareness of trade and 
investment opportunities between the two countries. The 
recommendations of the two co-chairmen of IBPI were presented to 
Mr. Narasimha Rao and Mr. John Major today. The report 
recommends for greater emphasis on the involvement of small- and 
medium-size companies. It has identified different sectors for 
business opportunities. These sectors include agro food 
processing, manufacturing technology, telecommunications and 
(?telemetry), infrastructure and environment, oil and gas, and 
industrial components. The report among other things identified 
major issues for the governments. Some of these are reduction 
in tariff, import duty, single window clearance system, 
flexibility in labor laws, and comprehensive infrastructure 
development. 
  Our correspondent Alok Deshwal reports from London that New 
Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas assistance 
for 1993-94. The United Kingdom has pledged 239 million pounds 
to India during this period. 
  Later, in his meeting with the secretary of state for 
defense, Mr. Rifkind, the prime minister discussed various ways 
and means of increasing defense cooperation between the two 
countries. Earlier, in the morning, Mr. Narasimha Rao had a 
breakfast meeting with the lord mayor of London. The prime 
minister called upon the British investors to show quick 
decisions about making investments in India. 
  Britain has announced a 10 million pounds assistance for the 
World Bank-aided rehabilitation project in the Maharashtra 
earthquake-hit areas. During her half-an-hour meeting with the 
prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in London this morning, the 
minister for overseas development assistance, Baroness (Linda 
Chalker), said this will be in addition to 3 million pounds aid 
Britain has already given. 
  Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, was formally 
received by the British prime minister, Mr. John Major; and the 
foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, at the Foreign Office in 
London this morning. He also inspected a special guard of honor.

  [Text] Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said 
tonight it had been made very clear to the IRA that there was no 
possibility of its involvement in negotiations in present 
circumstances. 
  The IRA had been told that if it ended terrorism, the 
British 
and Irish governments would be "generous in their response," he 
added. 
  But he said there had to be "an absolute renunciation of the 
violence, an end to violence, and an acceptance that violence 
will not solve the problems that we have on this island." 
  After recent incidents -- "the endangering of life at 
Heathrow, the murders in Belfast, it is time the IRA came to 
their senses and put it to an end," said Mr Spring, who is also 
his country's Foreign Minister and joint chairman -- with Ulster 
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew -- of the Anglo-Irish Northern 
Ireland Conference. 
  Mr Spring said the IRA's actions over the past few days 
appeared totally contradictory. "On the one hand, they are 
saying they are flexible, they want to look at the peace 
process. At the same time, they are insulting the intelligence 
of ordinary people by bombing Heathrow airport, threatening 
innocent people in their daily lives. That to me is a total 
contradiction. 
  ``They have to end the violence, they have to show 
willingness and an acceptance that the Downing Street 
declaration is the best prospect for establishing peace on this 
island,'' he said.

  [Text] An Armagh man wanted in Britain for the murder of a 
soldier has been freed by the Dublin district court. The 
release of Anthony Gorman follows the recent decision by the 
High Court not to extradite Joseph Magee to England for the same 
offense. Our legal affairs correspondent Kieron Wood reports. 
  [Wood] Twenty-four-year-old Anthony Gorman and 27-year-old 
Joseph Magee, both from Armagh city, are wanted in England for 
the murder of Sgt. Michael Newman outside an army recruiting 
office in Derby in 1992. Two weeks ago Magee was freed by the 
High Court. The judge said the shooting of Sgt. Newman with a 
nonautomatic weapon was a political offense. He also ruled that 
the district court order was invalid and that Magee wouldn't get 
a fair trial in England because of the prejudicial pretrial 
publicity. Following that decision, in the district court, 
sitting this morning in Green Street courthouse, counsel for the 
attorney general, Mr. Eamonn Leahy, said he was offering no 
evidence in the case of Gorman. Judge Gerard Horton said he'd 
make an order discharging the accused man. The entire hearing 
lasted just two minutes. Gorman was told by garda [police] he 
could leave. After speaking briefly to his lawyers he gave a 
clenched fist salute and shouted "let's go." He told reporters 
afterwards that he should never have been held. He said there 
was no justice for Irishmen in England, and he called for the 
release of other prisoners awaiting extradition. Kieron Wood, 
RTE News, the district court.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lego for the United Nations"] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of the year, UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali sent his emissaries to Europe on a 
particularly sensitive mission. They were to levy troops for 
blue helmet units that would be permanently available for UN 
operations such as the one in Somalia. 
  The Danes and Norwegians immediately made pledges. In Bonn, 
however, there were problems: The team from New York was 
consoled. The government's decision was that at this stage it 
could not name any Bundeswehr units that would be available for 
Butrus-Ghali's future intervention troops. The UN was asked to 
wait until the Bonn constitutional debate about the deployment 
of troops abroad has been settled and the German military 
mission in Somalia has been assessed. 
  Butrus-Ghali does not want to wait that long. He, along with 
the French, British, and Americans are trying to pressure the 
Germans, who are seeking a permanent seat on the UN Security 
Council, into making a greater military commitment. Germany is 
to provide New York with information on its UN troop contingent 
before the Bonn summer recess, that is, by the end of June. 
  The UN chief has drawn his first conclusions from the 
failure 
in Somalia. He never again wants to have to beg for soldiers 
all over the world when an operation is already in progress. 
Nations should maintain military units ("stand-by forces") 
which could be called up and assembled by an expanded general 
staff at UN headquarters under whose joint command they would be 
placed. 
  Bonn knows that it will not be able to refuse indefinitely. 
Concrete plans are already being prepared behind the scenes, as 
if the Bundestag had already changed the constitution, which 
forbids the deployment of Bundeswehr units in military 
conflicts, a long time ago. 
  The times when the government wanted to limit such 
involvement to high-tech troops for "humanitarian missions" are 
long over. German combat troops are also to be available now. 
  "The troops that we will provide to the United Nations will 
not be limited to medical orderlies and logistics specialists, 
but will cover the entire range," says one Defense Ministry 
planner. Following "Bundeswehr successes" in Cambodia, Somalia, 
and among the Kurds, says the Foreign Ministry, the allies' 
"expectations have become higher." 
  Thus, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union], has abandoned his plans to create two special 
battalions for UN missions along the lines of the Somalia force. 
The new plan envisages "maintaining" a large number of 
companies in various large formations, from communications 
specialists to paratroopers. 
  These units will receive special training and materiel. The 
military wants to form blue helmet units according to the "Lego 
system" (Defense Ministry jargon). In Regensburg, a special 
command staff ("airborne forces command") is already being 
formed and it should command forces all over the world. 
  Military leaders do not want to have to look once again for 
troops in 200 different units as was the case with their corps 
for Africa. "We need," says a planner in the best military 
German, "units that are available and on alert and will serve as 
elements for putting together larger formations." 
  The detailing of troops should not be the end of the matter. 
The people in Bonn are pressing for more organizational 
positions. The Defense Ministry is calling for more key 
positions in the UN military staff. At the moment, there are 
five Bundeswehr officers there, and only two of them are serving 
in the important operational section. "We must be present in 
coordination and decisionmaking," says one Kinkel colleague, 
drawing conclusions from the Somalia debacle. 
  Irrespective of the price? 
  Senior Bonn military officials are already working out a 
simple sum: As in NATO, the number of posts in the military 
staff should be based on the number of troops in contingents. 
Thus, the Germans would have to offer several thousand troops 
to be able to take part in decisions on how the United Nations 
is to promote peace. 
  Bonn's allies have made it clear beyond any doubt that 
whoever wants to participate in command decisions must also 
participate on the battlefield. The chancellor has had to 
abandon his belief that Bundeswehr troops have nothing to look 
for in territories that were at one time occupied by Hitler's 
troops, such as Bosnia and the former Soviet Union. The people 
in Bonn have been trying to avoid deployment in former 
Yugoslavia, despite being urged to do so by the main allies. 
Several blue helmet battalions belonging to other nations have 
been fully equipped with former GDR People's Army equipment at 
no cost. Hundreds of trucks, armored personnel carriers, and 
radio communications units have been given to a Pakistani 
regiment as a present. 
  The government will not get away so lightly next time. In 
its capacity as a regional UN organization, the CSCE is 
currently looking for forces to be used in an armed peace 
mission in the Caucasus. 
  In the crisis region of Nagorno-Karabakh, where Armenians 
and 
Azerbaijanis have been waging a bloody conflict for years, the 
CSCE is planning its first large-scale operation as a guarantor 
of peace. A demilitarized corridor is to be created between the 
two opposing parties and it is to be safeguarded by an 
international buffer force. According to a Defense Ministry 
general, "the inevitable question for us is what form will 
Germany's participation take?" 
  Bonn and NATO face a dilemma. On the one hand, no Western 
state is prepared, according to a Kinkel aide, "to get its 
fingers burned there." On the other hand, the Germans do not 
want the Russians alone to ensure order in the former Soviet 
Union -- not even if they receive a concrete assignment from the 
United Nations or the CSCE. What the Western states have 
proposed is that Moscow should provide the troops, but that CSCE 
officers, including Germans, must also be given supervisory 
roles in blue helmet staff headquarters. Their job, says a Bonn 
diplomat, would be to ensure the Russians adhere "to the rules 
of the game." 
  The Russians have responded cleverly. CSCE officers are 
welcome in the sensitive Caucasus mission, but on one condition: 
Western states are either to provide them with their own troops 
or provide the Russian Army with money.

<F P=106> [Article by Dieter Wenz: "People of Baden, Swabians, and the </F>
Rhine Boundary--The `Europe of Regions' Is an Icon"] 
  [Text] Freiburg, Feb -- Everybody talks about Europe and 
hardly anyone knows exactly what he is talking about. This is 
even the case along the Rhine between eastern France and 
southwestern Germany. "Meaningful regional politics here must be 
politics that transcend the border," says Lord Mayor Boehme of 
Freiburg. The western limits of this city in Baden extend to 
within three kilometers of the Rhine and France. Stuttgart, the 
capital city in the Swabian part of the land, is located 80 
kilometers by road to the east, already far enough, it appears, 
for estrangement and indifference to have set in. 
  "Still today, I feel that it is a gift of history and a 
great 
stroke of luck," Boehme writes, that he is received "as a 
friend" in the department store in Colmar or in the city hall in 
Mulhouse or Strasbourg, and that he is able to discuss "our 
problems here without official posturing." Again and again, 
however, agency heads in Wuerttemberg, including some very 
capable ministers, have interfered with their friends' efforts. 
"Why should we give the French money to boot?" one of them said 
recently. 
  Also the blissful coexistence of the German and French 
neighbors will suffer if a price is put on it. Municipal leaders 
and representatives from the German Upper Rhine region and 
Alsace recently held another of their periodic meetings. At 
issue was a project affecting both these regions which was to 
have cost 50,000 German marks [DM]. According to the notes taken 
by the lord mayor of Freiburg, the German side was represented 
by members of the land government in Stuttgart and their 
responsible officials, important people, since they administer 
the finances "and in the final analysis decide on the fate of 
the projects." Representing the French side were, above all, 
Alsatian mayors and their employees, in many cases "intelligent 
and distinguished" men, "fluent in both languages and at home in 
both cultures." 
  "Well now, Mister Mayor!" Cautiously, at first, the pros and 
cons of the project had been discussed. At some point, however, 
senior public servant Mueller from Stuttgart could not remain 
seated any longer--he jumped up, fixed his eyes on the aged 
mayor of Colmar, Gerrer, and bellowed out: "Wouldn't just 30,000 
do the trick?" The reference was to German marks. "I felt 
ashamed," recalls administrative chief Boehme, who was also a 
Bundestag representative for ten years and then a parliamentary 
state secretary in Bonn. 
  All this might perhaps not even have been necessary. In 
1945, 
the French had marched into the regions of the Upper Rhine and 
along the section of the river between Basel and Lake Constance, 
and this had brought not only privations. "We young people," 
recalls Boehme, who was born in Konstanz, "at that time ventured 
into the realm of French culture, a realm which from then one 
kept everyone from our generation firmly in its grip." And now 
the European internal market is offering opportunities which 
transcend the old boundaries. But business deals are not 
everything. To this day, European progress remains an 
administrative snail. The truth is that mayors, representatives, 
and district councillors from Baden feel closer to Strasbourg 
than to Stuttgart. Here, too, lies the serious crux of the 
"Baden question," a question which has now come back with a 
vengeance in the land. 
  Freiburg is now growing and flourishing. When the 
smokestacks 
in Swabia were still vying with each other to see which one 
could put out more smoke, the services metropolis in Baden had 
been smiled at condescendingly. But it was precisely the small 
number of manufacturing trades which in the end made the 
community less dependent on economic fluctuations. Where until 
recently the city's effluents were still seeping into the 
ground, a new city district is being built, ten thousand people 
are to find housing there, soon the 200,000th inhabitant will be 
welcomed to the city. The city is going places, but where is 
there to go with its belly up against the Rhine? 
  Karlsruhe is flourishing. With no-nonsense steadfastness, 
Lord Mayor Seiler brought an economic boom to the old royal 
seat, the likes of which very few German cities have experienced 
during the last ten years. But what else is there? In Karlsruhe 
is the royal residence, so the song of the Badeners goes, "in 
Mannheim, the factory." Mannheim, in northern Baden, will have 
to take care that it will be left with a few factories. Rastatt 
is bracing itself against decline, and Baden-Baden, once an 
internationally known spa, is losing its luster. 
  One's own efforts, even the most forceful, are now 
increasingly encountering limits, complains Professor Seiler, a 
political economist respected not only in Karlsruhe. "We are 
being deprived of the centrality to which we are entitled." 
Early on, already, numerous land agencies, including free-lance 
chambers, municipal associations, and industrial organizations, 
were pulled out and moved to Stuttgart. It is true, Seiler 
stated, that the state theaters in Stuttgart claim more public 
funds than those in Karlsruhe and Mannheim combined. The flow 
into the Swabian interior has become ever stronger, he stated: 
DM1.4 billion of the land's money is to be spent on the 
expansion of the airport on Swabian soil. DM5 million, possibly 
a little more, is to be made available for a regional airport in 
northern Baden (in Soellingen). 
  The list is a long one, and fiscal and tax law expert Boehme 
has no desire to go through it in detail. But he does want to 
talk about "centralistic stupidities." The central Neckar 
region, with its classical machine construction and automobile 
and automotive supplier industries, "all this is out," his 
agency maintains. For some time, already, decentralized, 
flexible structures have been required. What is needed more and 
more is an intelligent production that is compatible with the 
"environment and human beings." 
  "This here," attorney Boehme, referring to the Rhine basin, 
is convinced, "this is the future." Here only the West European 
card can be trump. It is in the hands of the Germans and the 
French. Why does one not play this card? 
  In 1953, Baden and Wuerttemberg were joined as states, 
naturally for reasons of expediency. As late as 1970, it had 
taken a plebiscite to placate the "old Baden" resistance that 
was still flaring up against the hyphenated makeshift 
construction of Baden-Wuerttemberg. But the land has never 
really become one--the financial and mental differences 
prevailing there, and the pride taken in these differences, have 
historical roots. The wish for more "freedom" and "autonomy" was 
heard much sooner in the grand duchy of Baden than in the 
rigidly regulated state of the Wuerttemberg kings. The promises 
of the French Revolution had their effect along the Rhine. Since 
then the Swabians have been viewed not only by the residents of 
Baden as efficient, but sometimes also grimly determined, 
workers. "Work imperialists," Theodor Eschenburg once lovingly 
called them. The residents of Baden see themselves mainly as 
quieter, more creative, and more imaginative. But again and 
again they have also been on the losing end, and not just in the 
dual confederation. They have always been willing to give in, 
even if only for a good glass of wine. 
  Small occurrences in everyday municipal life in western 
European border regions are sometimes more revealing than 
polished papers of the government. Lord Mayor Boehme of Freiburg 
now plans to concern himself more with contacts with Alsatian 
politicians and with the project of a "Bi-Lingua-Zone," a 
project that is to promote linguistic understanding at least 
directly along the Rhine. Itinerant lecturer Oskar Lafontaine, 
who in other respects is not easily irritated, expressed 
concerns recently while in the region that Germany and France 
might drift apart permanently. Not far from Freiburg, in Colmar, 
Prime Minister Balladur recently raised his bushy eyebrows, 
sounded warnings against the creation of cross-border 
dependencies, and called on the residents of eastern France to 
strengthen the nation above all. 
  The German-French border region--where the postulates of 
increased municipal capabilities to create and act, of autonomy, 
and of "subsidiarity" would have had a special meaning--feels 
itself without an appropriate role: Even along the upper Rhine, 
the "Europe of regions" has remained an icon. That, too, has 
caused old dissatisfactions to resurface in the extreme 
southwestern region of many.

<F P=106> [F. Weckbach-Mara report: "Vietnamese Smuggled to Germany </F>
-- Government Also Cashes In"] 
  [Text] Gangs of Vietnamese smugglers are illegally 
smuggling asylum-seekers to Germany with the support of their 
government. According to information obtained by BILD AM 
SONNTAG, this is stated in alarming reports by police and 
intelligence services, which are available to the Federal 
Government. 
  According to these reports, the state tourism administration 
(Vietnam National Administration of Tourism) gets about $6,500 
for each Vietnamese, who is smuggled into Germany via Moscow, 
Prague, and the relatively unguarded border. So far, police 
authorities have registered 100 such smuggling organizations. 
  To prepare the operations -- the reports say -- Hoang D. Tao 
of the Vietnamese Economics Ministry and Tran T. Ngi of the 
Vietnam National Administration of Tourism were in Germany. 
Obviously, they arranged with the Embassy in Bonn that 
practically any desired document be issued for asylum-seekers in 
Germany "for a fee." They learned what is needed from 
Vietnamese asylum-seekers, whom they questioned in reception 
camps. 
  According to information obtained by BILD AM SONNTAG, the 
Vietnamese Labor Ministry is officially propagating a policy for 
the export of Vietnamese workers -- in the hope of getting 
foreign currency for the state coffers. Bernd Schmidbauer 
(Christian Democratic Union), the coordinators of the 
intelligence services in the chancellor's office, told BILD AM 
SONNTAG concerning the police findings: "We have to take these 
reports very seriously and we will do everything to prevent a 
new wave of smuggling operations."

<F P=106> [Report by Margarete Limberg] </F>
  [Text] Social Democratic Party [SPD] Chairman Rudolf 
Scharping appeared to be highly satisfied with Gerhard 
Schroeder's election success. When praising his former rival 
for SPD chairman, Scharping did not miss the opportunity to pay 
due tribute to the federal SPD too, which he is heading. 
  [Begin Scharping recording] It has been a clear victory for 
Gerhard Schroeder and the Lower Saxon SPD, and the principal 
credit goes to them. The success is the result of high 
concentration on issues of economic development, fighting 
unemployment, and the restoration of social rights, against the 
background of remarkable achievements in the land in terms of 
housing construction, kindergartens, and education policy. The 
fact that, at a federal level, the SPD has become a stable 
force, was certainly not a disadvantage -- I think it was even 
helpful. [end recording] 
  Gerhard Schroeder had given assurance that he and Scharping 
were only temporary rivals while now they were friends again 
just as in the past. Moreover, he is certainly too intelligent 
to indulge in excessive muscle flexing. Nevertheless, Schroeder 
will not hide his light under a bushel, and his weight in the 
federal party has certainly increased. 
  Despite the satisfaction about the good start into the 1994 
super election year, Rudolf Scharping's statements were 
characterized by his traditional sobriety. He said that the 
election victory gave the SPD the opportunity to achieve clear 
leadership. 
  [Begin Scharping recording] From that aspect, the result is 
optimal. It does not mean the trees will grow to unprecedented 
heights but it indicates that we do have good chances and that 
we have to continue our hard work and maintain our high 
concentration. I would like to warn everybody in our own party 
against sticking their noses up in the air. [end recording] 
  Lower Saxony is the first land in which a coalition between 
the SPD and Greens went through a whole legislative term, and in 
which the SPD was not harmed through its alliance with the 
Greens. Nevertheless, the SPD leadership does not yet want to 
draw any conclusions from that for the Bundestag election and, 
what is more, does not want to have a coalition discussion 
forced upon it at an early stage. The goal of becoming the 
strongest party has now become even more realistic, Scharping 
said, and he anticipates that the offer of coalition partners 
will be larger than the demand -- which, as everybody knows, is 
something that always reduces prices, he said. 
  Scharping assessed the renaissance of the main parties, 
which 
won 80 percent of the vote in Lower Saxony, as positive. This 
is a sign that there is still a chance to reduce the public 
irritation with politicians and political parties, Scharping 
said. In addition, it was encouraging that the Republikaner 
were given a rebuff. Nevertheless, their share in the vote was 
still much too high, Scharping concluded.

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Social Democratic Party [SPD] 
Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned the Social Democrats 
against being too confident of victory after winning the state 
parliament elections in Lower Saxony. Sunday's result was an 
encouraging signal that the SPD can achieve a clear lead in 
Germany, Scharping said in Bonn at noon today, but this has to 
be worked for. 
  The SPD leader added: "I can only warn against going around 
with our heads held so high the rain gets up our noses." 
Scharping stressed that in this respect the outcome of the 
Lower Saxony election was "the best possible" because it does 
not mean there is nothing better to come. At the same time, the 
aim of the SPD to be the strongest party in the Bundestag 
election has become "a lot more realistic." Scharping again 
refused to state with which party the SPD would be prepared to 
form a coalition before the Bundestag election. 
  The SPD leader stressed that the result of the Lower Saxon 
election is a good start to the 1994 election year and an 
impressive confirmation of the work of Minister President 
Gerhard Schroeder (SPD). The fact that the SPD has become a 
stable force at national level has certainly not harmed things 
either he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping by Klaus </F>
Zoellner; place and date not given: "We Will Never Cooperate 
With the PDS"] 
  [Text] [Zoellner] Mr. Minister-President, you have been 
elected [frontrunner of the Rhineland-Palatinate ticket] without 
any dissenting votes. Six months before election day, does the 
mood of the Social Democrats seem to be good? 
  [Scharping] Yes, the mood is very good. By its clear 
concentration on combating unemployment, and the reestablishment 
of social justice and internal peace in Germany, the Social 
Democratic Party [SPD] has distinguished itself and gained 
confidence and competence and I am sure we have a very good 
chance in the Bundestag election. 
  [Zoellner] The present mood in the population, the voters, 
seems to be not so good. Never before has weariness with 
politics or even an election boycott been mentioned so often.... 
  [Scharping] First of all, politicians have to act in the way 
they talk and politicians have to talk in they way they think. 
The basic political capital, that is, confidence, has been 
considerably damaged by the past few years and many untenable 
promises, particularly regarding German unity. Nevertheless, I 
think that many things in the public debate on weariness with 
politics are exaggerated and wrong. I know many older and 
younger men and women who are very interested in politics and 
are also committed. People are annoyed at the political 
behavior and political parties, too. The turnout in the 
Bundestag elections will be considerably higher than many 
believe. 
  [Zoellner] Take the new laender. In the so-called 
reunification election campaign, the key points were focused 
there. Is this where the established parties should expect the 
greatest number of people who refuse to go the the polls, since 
it is precisely there that many promises have hardly been kept, 
and in many places there is decline instead of recovery? 
  [Scharping] I hope not! Precisely regarding eastern 
Germany, one has to say: If people have lived under dictatorial 
conditions for many decades and then achieve freedom and 
democracy, one has to deal with the implied hope in a 
particularly careful and credible way. It was a bad mistake to 
promise because of the election campaign in 1990 that unity will 
be managed without tax increases and it was also a bad mistake 
to promise flourishing landscapes to the people in eastern 
Germany. Both things have to be corrected. However, this 
requires that politicians formulate objectives and that all work 
credibly on them, not only in politics, but also in the 
enterprises and the trade unions. The concentration of forces 
and new hope in Germany -- this seems to me a promising concept 
for the country and the people. 
  [Zoellner] Take the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS]. In 
the new laender the PDS is increasingly accepted. How seriously 
do the Social Democrats take the New Left? 
  [Scharping] None of the radical parties, neither the PDS nor 
the Republikaner, is a partner for the SPD. On the contrary, 
these parties are being combatted in a particularly resolute way 
and all people in eastern Germany have to know that social 
progress, internal stability, justice in Germany, the 
procurement of work, that all that is in the best hands with the 
Social Democrats. Those who want to vote for the PDS because 
they are angry and want to protest have to know that this is the 
wrong course. Those who want to take effective action for 
Germany's inner unity should turn to Social Democracy. Those 
who vote for the PDS throw their votes into the wastepaper 
basket because this party will not participate in the formation 
of will. 
  [Zoellner] Have I understood you correctly that, in your 
opinion, the PDS is not a new leftist, democratic party, but a 
radical party? 
  [Scharping] The PDS is the immediate successor of the 
Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the old forces are also 
increasingly gaining ground there. No, for us the PDS is a 
party with which we cannot and will not cooperate as a matter of 
principle. 
  [Zoellner] A clear word. That is to say, the PDS is also no 
partner for a talk on the necessary majority in Bonn? 
  [Scharping] No. We guarantee that we will never cooperate 
with the PDS or other radicals and we also guarantee that we 
will not conduct an election campaign for a coalition, but for 
the objective that the SPD will be able to take over the lead in 
politics and the government. 
  [Zoellner] Finally a topical issue: nursing-care insurance. 
After it looked as if an agreement on this question were not 
possible, an agreement was suddenly achieved. Excuse me, but 
this smacks of election tactics.... 
  [Scharping] No. Permit me a personal remark: Since the 
fall, I have made intensive efforts to bring about the 
nursing-care insurance, I invested much time and strength, and I 
am satisfied that a result has now finally been achieved. This 
would have been earlier possible in the interest of those 
affected and who need nursing care. For me this is a reasonable 
and justifiable result and it is a result achieved at the very 
last minute with a view to the parties' prestige. We from the 
SPD would not have been able to afford the to-and-fro over more 
weeks or even months.

<F P=106> [Article by Wolfgang Stock: "Solely on the Left--The Greens </F>
Want To Share Government in Bonn"] 
  [Text] Bonn, Feb -- "The Alliance 90/Greens want to share 
in the responsibility for the future." Thus begins the campaign 
platform of those Greens who at one time had lined up in 
opposition to the "established" parties, both inside and outside 
the parliaments, but most assuredly without having any sort of 
governing responsibility. 
  In many land governments, this is now nothing more than 
yesterday's dogma. The party--including all its factions--is now 
trying with all its might to get to the cabinet's table in the 
Chancellor's Office. That this will come about is seen by many 
as probable. The weakness of the Kohl government, they say, and 
the "right" image that SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] 
Chairman Scharping has prescribed for his party, have opened up 
great opportunities for a left-wing party. 
  The Greens want to avail themselves of these opportunities. 
The platform approved by them over the weekend does reaffirm 
their old goals, to be sure, but at the same time it qualified 
them dramatically: Not one of the demands contained in the 
campaign platform could be cited as a justification for causing 
a failure of coalition negotiations with the SPD, neither by the 
Green fundamentalists nor by the Social Democrats. Likewise, of 
the points of controversy that arose between the "realists" and 
the leftist "fundamentalists" at the party congress over the 
weekend, all lend themselves to negotiation, for the party is 
bent on gaining power. After 14 years in an opposition role and 
an apprenticeship in a number of land governments, the Greens 
finally want to help shape politics in Bonn. 
  The Greens as a party of the "sixty-eighters" have grown 
older. Like all other parties, it now has a youth organization. 
But not only aging has caused the Greens to become wiser, the 
country's reunification, as well, changed them in many ways. 
"Alliance 90/The Greens"--this is not only a new name. Even 
though the courageous GDR civil rights proponents of 1989/90 are 
of little consequence numerically, they did lastingly change the 
face of the party that had been unified only a year earlier. 
Especially in the area of foreign and security policies, many of 
the civil rights campaigners successfully called into question 
traditional positions, ranging from the use of military force to 
save people in Bosnia to the debate on the Bundeswehr. To be 
sure, the "realists" have so far been unable to gain a 
"structural" majority, yet the party's left wing felt compelled 
prior to the party congress in Mannheim to give the assurance 
that it had "never" demanded in the recent past that the 
Bundeswehr must be abolished "immediately." The word now is that 
this will be a long-lasting "process"--in view of the very real 
budgetary concerns, it is now easier than it was before to 
convince people that this process has already begun. 
  Before the Greens could gain access to a Federal Government, 
they would of course have to return to the Bundestag. In the 
last elections, the west German Greens had not managed to do 
this--contrary to all expectations. And so they associate with 
German unity the memory of their greatest defeat. Because they 
conducted an unrealistic ideological campaign in 1990, they did 
not receive the required 5 percent of the votes. "Green" 
parliamentary work at the federal level has since been carried 
out by the successful civil rights campaigners of the Alliance 
90 from the east. 
  Those responsible learned from this bitter experience. The 
party congress over the weekend was marked by real concerns of 
the voters--jobs and a secure future. Ecology was in last place. 
In its program, the party is pinning its hopes on a solidarity 
alliance of the materially satisfied middle class, which is 
willing to make financial sacrifices for more quality of life 
and environmental protection, also for socially weaker persons. 
But that will not suffice for the "basic social security" which 
provides for circa 1,300 German marks [DM] per month for 
everyone. For that reason, the party wants to tax the "huge" 
capital and land holdings of the rich at a substantially higher 
rate than in the past. Following the pattern set by West 
European neighbors, also heirs are to share their "unearned" 
gain with the "poor." 
  With these leftist redistribution maxims and its resolutions 
calling for a drastic reduction of working hours, the party is 
more radical than the SPD, and yet is not too far distant from 
it. At the same time, the Greens' former criticism of capitalism 
has become more muted. Even though they denounce the alleged 
failure of the market economy in the reconstruction of the east, 
they nevertheless want to exploit the forces of the marketplace 
in the ecological tax reform. Here it is even difficult to find 
differences from the new "ecological and social market economy" 
of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]. 
  And so the controversy between the party's fundamentalists 
and the realists basically turned only on the question of how 
sharply the Alliance 90/Greens, as a left-wing party, is to 
distinguish itself in its election platform from what is alleged 
to be an SPD that has moved to the right--and how honestly one 
plans to say that "everything is negotiable." 
  Despite their clear coalition statement, the Greens are 
under 
no illusions. Even though polls currently show them to be the 
third strongest party: Only the results of the election in the 
fall will show whether they can "force" the SPD to adopt a 
"reform policy," or whether Scharping must seek his salvation in 
a different, perhaps grand, coalition. For the Greens know that 
the SPD chairman is not exactly an enthusiastic supporter of 
"red-green." What Scharping would probably like most of all is 
to play the Greens and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] off 
against each other in a "traffic-light coalition." 
  The Alliance 90/Greens is less enthralled by such a 
prospect. 
For that reason, the party is now offering its services as the 
best guarantee to avoid the nightmare of a grand coalition--it 
plans to offer itself to the voter as the "sole left-wing 
party." A professional campaign management team is to help the 
party achieve its goal, a party that is as united and motivated 
as never before.

<F P=106> [Article by Guenter Bannas: "`The Greens Aren't Going To </F>
Find a Partner for That'--The SPD Distances Itself From the 
Red-Green Possibility"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 28 Feb -- Following the party congress 
resolutions of the Alliance 90/Greens on security and energy 
policies, the leaders of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of 
Germany] see a confirmation of the correctness of their strategy 
not to burden their campaign with the announcement of a 
red-green coalition. The Greens' demand for a "political 
initiative for the disbandment of NATO" and for the abolishment 
of compulsory military service, as well as their assertion that 
all German nuclear power plants could be shut down within two 
years, would otherwise have prejudiced SPD Chairman Scharping's 
strategy for broadening the voter spectrum of the SPD with 
signals of domestic policy reliability and foreign policy 
continuity. The party congress of the Alliance 90/Greens does, 
however, provide him with a basis for defending, if it comes to 
that, the failure of red-green coalition negotiations following 
the Bundestag election against the left wing of the SPD, which 
wants "red-green." 
  Following the conclusion of the party congress of the 
Alliance 90/Greens, SPD national business manager Verheugen 
called their resolutions "unrealistic dreams." "The Greens will 
find no partner for this platform." It is above all the 
resolution calling for the disbandment of NATO which is being 
opposed in the SPD. The remark by the chairman of the Young 
Socialists, Westphal, viz. that "we want to resolve something 
similar at our next party congress," is approved by only a 
minority even among SPD left-wingers. In disagreeing with this 
remark, Verheugen stated: "To demand NATO's disbandment at a 
time when the Central and East European countries would like 
nothing more than to join it is not only unrealistic, it is also 
intrinsically wrong." 
  Of course, the SPD leadership does not already now want to 
rule out a red-green coalition following the Bundestag election. 
It is not sure if the party congress resolution of the Alliance 
90/Greens on foreign policy will be made a condition in 
coalition negotiations. In this case, they assure us, the 
coalition talks would fail. If, on the other hand, Alliance 
90/Greens were ready to compromise, the party would suffer a 
"credibility gap." In view of this, Verheugen termed their 
resolution "astonishing." The executive committee spokeswoman of 
Alliance 90/Greens, Birthler, sought to modify the consequences 
that the resolutions would have on coalition policies with the 
remark that no one had demanded "that NATO immediately vanish 
into thin air." She called attention to the formulation which 
called for NATO to be absorbed by a system of mutual security 
and a restored CSCE. 
  That could create some leeway for negotiations. Verheugen 
said that, following the election, the SPD--assuming a favorable 
outcome of the election--would talk with all democratic parties, 
thereby excluding the Republikaner and the PDS [Party of 
Democratic Socialism] as conversational partners of the SPD. 
However, democratic parties, in Verheugen's opinion, are not to 
be excluded from the outset from talks for reasons of their 
platforms alone. 
  The, at best, basic candor of the SPD leadership serves not 
only the purpose of winning over voters who in the event of a 
commitment to the Alliance 90/Greens might vote for the current 
coalition or--to assure their entry into the Bundestag--to the 
Alliance 90/Greens. It is also an expression of the tensions 
existing between proponents and opponents of a red-green 
coalition. The left wing of the SPD wants to give red-green 
cooperation "a solid programmatic foundation above and beyond 
the pure arithmetics of a coalition." It was in this vein that 
the chairman of the Young Socialists, Westphal, warned the SPD 
leadership against branding the Greens as "incapable of making 
politics." Standing on the other side is the labor union wing of 
the SPD. IG-Chemie Chairman Rappe advised the SPD leaders "to 
ignore the signals of the Greens and to stop striving for 
red-green coalitions." Otherwise, the competence of the SPD in 
the economic and foreign policy arenas will be jeopardized. 
Rappe outlined his preferences last week in the NEUE 
OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG: "Given a choice, I view red-green as the 
worst possible of all conceivable coalitions. In that case, I 
would prefer the FDP [Free Democratic Party] or the CDU/CSU 
[Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] every time."

<F P=106> [Article by "hjh": "Modrow Heads PDS Ticket for European </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- The struggle against mass unemployment 
will be the priority issue for the Party of Democratic Socialism 
[PDS] in the forthcoming election campaigns. At the federal 
party congress over the weekend the delegates adopted 
corresponding programs for the European elections and the 
Bundestag elections. Honorary PDS Chairman Hans Modrow was 
nominated as top candidate for the European elections. A total 
of 94 percent of the delegates voted for the former GDR premier, 
who was indicted for perjury on Friday [11 March]. The fourth 
place on the ticket is occupied by Heinrich Fink, former rector 
of the Berlin Humboldt University -- another candidate who has 
been laid open to suspicion because of his former contacts with 
the Stasi. Before his election, Fink came out against locking 
the Stasi files away. One just has to read them correctly, he 
said, defending his former role in the GDR. 
  In its European program the PDS rejects the Maastricht 
Treaties, but it comes out in favor of European unification and 
the creation of a "European Germany." In the future European 
Parliament the PDS wants to work for overcoming mass 
unemployment, for equal rights for men and women, for more 
democracy, and for an ecological restructuring. 
  If it gets into the Bundestag again, the PDS plans to work 
for the same goals there. At the conclusion of the party 
congress, Bundestag group chairman Gregor Gysi expressed 
optimism that the PDS will have even more deputies than so far 
in the new Bundestag. It will be a "consistent opposition 
party" there, Gysi announced. He explained in detail how the 
PDS wants to combat unemployment. In this connection, Gysi 
called for flexible work time models, an industrial policy by 
the state, the reduction of obstacles for investments and 
employment, as well as alternative forms of production. The 
social division of the society because of unemployment is 
gaining the dimension of social destruction, Gysi said. 
  Gysi rejected the accusation from the ranks of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] that the PDS is preventing a 
change in power in Bonn. The Bundestag deputy noted that it is 
the declared goal of the SPD to block the PDS. The SPD and 
Alliance 90/Greens are striving for participation in power at 
almost any cost. However, they are not a real alternative. The 
decision for the PDS does not endanger the political change in 
Germany. It is not the Social Democrats that are the "main 
enemy" of the PDS; the main enemy is on the Right, Gysi said. 
However, the SPD remains a political opponent. On the fringes 
of the congress, the former PDS chairman said that he is always 
ready for cooperation with the SPD on specific, individual 
issues.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dispute Over Germany's New Role"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Berlin -- A dispute has broken out within the 
coalition over Germany's future role in foreign and security 
policies. On the weekend, Christian Social Union [CSU] 
politicians demanded that the government change its course and 
emphasized their right to cocreate European policy. The Free 
Democratic Party [FDP] sharply rejected their coalition 
partner's initiative yesterday. [passage omitted] 
  CSU Land Group Chairman Michael Glos stressed that the "key 
problem" is that Europe is a giant in terms of economy, but a 
dwarf politically. Glos said it is "intolerable" that the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] still opposes an amendment of the 
constitution that would allow German forces to participate in 
missions outside NATO territory. 
  According to FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer, the CSU's 
shooting forward in foreign policy matters is a mock attack. 
The CSU is "deeply at odds" in European policy and presents 
"completely differing positions to the outside," Hoyer said. 
Thus, the Maastricht Treaty bears Waigel's signature on the one 
hand, while on the other Bavarian Minister President Edmund 
Stoiber (CSU) "takes every opportunity to spoil this agreement 
and the European idea." Hoyer said that a calm course and 
predictability are especially important now if one wants to 
achieve something for Germany in terms of foreign policy. 
  The CSU's demands have also been criticized by SPD Bundestag 
Group Chairman Hans-Ulrich Klose. He strongly rejected Waigel's 
demand for a quick association of the East European reform 
states up to full membership in NATO and the European Union 
(EU). The EU is in a difficult position at the moment: "We do 
not want a mega-EU," Klose said at the Spring Conference of the 
Political Club of the Tutzing Protestant Academy. He said he 
does not see any chance for countries like the Ukraine to be 
accepted in the next 15 years.

<F P=106> [Article ay "hig.": "Will Gasoline Become Even More </F>
Expensive? Bonn Is Looking for `Income Improvements'"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 13 Mar -- FRG Finance Minister Waigel 
(Christian Social Union) is considering a further increase in 
the gasoline tax in 1996, to finance the old debts of the 
railroad. On Sunday [13 March] in Bonn, a Finance Ministry 
spokeswoman confirmed relevant statements by Waigel that had 
resulted in fierce discussions over the weekend. However, she 
said that an increase in the gasoline tax "comes last" in 
considerations about servicing old debts of the railroad. Tax 
increases are not being contemplated in the first place. The 
private financing of the superhighway or superhighway tolls with 
a sticker is also being considered. To finance the second stage 
of the railroad reform, further "income improvements" in the 
traffic sector are necessary in 1996. The coalition decision on 
the railroad reform provides for this. Transportation Minister 
Wissmann (Christian Democratic Union) will be presenting the 
relevant proposals. 
  The spokeswoman rejected statements on the extent of the tax 
increase -- DER SPIEGEL reported an increase of eight pfennigs 
-- as "speculations." At the beginning of this year, the 
gasoline tax was already increased by 16 pfennigs per liter of 
gasoline and seven pfennigs for diesel to finance the debts of 
the railroad. 
  However, Transportation Minister Wissmann warned against a 
further increase of the mineral oil tax. People on lower 
incomes cannot cope with such a burden, he said in an interview. 
In order to relieve the traffic budget, even more private 
financing of traffic projects than has been planned so far is 
required. "The gasoline tax screw" must not be turned. 
Koppelin, chairman of the Schleswig-Holstein Free Democratic 
Party of Germany, sharply criticized Waigel's plans. Even now, 
Germany has the highest gasoline prices. Those like Waigel who 
call for tax increases obstruct the economic recovery and 
endanger additional jobs. Car drivers are not a "financial milk 
cow" for Waigel. 
  The railroad reform, which was resolved after long 
controversies between the government and the laender over the 
distribution of burdens in December, made it possible that the 
West German and East German railroads were transformed into a 
stock corporation on 1 January. It is to increase the 
railroad's competitiveness in the long run. However, the 
government continues to bear a large part of the burdens and to 
take some future risks. It has not only assumed the 
responsibility for old debts of about 70 billion German marks 
[DM] from 40 years of the West German railroad, but it also 
continues to participate in financing the development of the 
railroad lines. In addition, the government has to bear the 
costs of the East German railroad's adaptation to west German 
standards. The investment in the East German railroad is 
estimated at DM33 billion over the next nine years. As it has 
been resolved, the Federal Government also wants to participate 
with about DM6 billion in the costs of the Transrapid magnetic 
levitation train.

<F P=106> [Article by "tl": "Dasa Turnover To Grow to DM2.5 Billion </F>
in the Civilian Sector"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 12-13 Mar -- Deutsche Aerospace AG (Dasa), 
Munich, has appealed to the Federal Government to improve during 
the first half of this year the possibilities for German 
companies to participate in international cooperation projects 
in the armament sector. Otherwise, 4,000 jobs will be lost, 
Werner Heinzmann, member of the Dasa Executive Committee and 
chairman of the company branches space flight, defense, and 
civilian systems, told journalists in Bonn. 
  Dasa is trying to put the entire field of guided weapons 
into 
Euromissile -- a joint subsidiary with the French Aerospatiale. 
The seat is to be in France. Heinzmann reported "very positive 
signals" from the Federal Government, which is to facilitate 
armament cooperation projects in line with the so-called 
Schmidt-Debre Agreement in the next few weeks. This agreement 
refers to government cooperation projects and says one partner 
country must inform the other but the partner country does not 
have the right to veto the export intentions of the other 
partner. According to Heinzmann, France has been able to export 
the Milan and Roland weapons systems to areas, which would have 
been taboo for German companies because of the tighter export 
control. The Dasa Executive Committee demands from the Federal 
Government that this agreement should not just apply to 
government cooperation projects but also for industrial 
cooperation. The FRG Economics Ministry has confirmed that 
corresponding talks are taking place, but no details were 
revealed. 
  According to Heinzmann, the joint subsidiary Euromissile 
would have a turnover of about 3 billion German marks [DM], to 
which Dasa contributes about DM1 billion. Heinzmann justified 
the French interest in cooperation by pointing to the fact that 
the German market continues to be interesting and that the 
Germans have complementary skills, which are indispensable for 
the French. 
  According to Heinzmann, pure program cooperation is no 
longer 
sufficient, since the capacities have become undercriticial in 
many fields because of drastic cutbacks in the defense budgets, 
Heinzman said. Preservation is possible only in "full-step" 
European companies with a bundling of the resources and mutual 
dependence and supplies (single-sourcing). Heinzmann: "Basic 
military business can survive only in European companies in the 
future." Nevertheless, there remains defending the central 
business of Dasa. For this purpose, however, the company needs 
planning security provided by the Federal Government. 
  According to Heinzmann, basic military business is the 
precondition for growth in civilian markets. Heinzmann 
announced "considerable efforts" to develop new civilian 
business and to expand existing markets. Here he cited in 
particular communications and information technology, 
environmental technology, and satellite-based navigation 
systems. Turnover in the civilian sector should rise from about 
DM700 million to up to DM2.5 billion. Since 1990 Dasa has 
created about 1,300 new jobs in the civilian area and it plans 
to create another 1,500 new jobs there by 1998, Heinzmann said. 
Dasa will leave research and development investments at the 
former high level of DM1.5 billion in five years to finance 
entering new fields of growth. Heinzmann warned Bonn against 
ending activities in manned space flight.

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Haendeler: "Germany Has Missed the Boat; </F>
Thoughts on Kondratieff's Theory of Long Economic Cycles"] 
  [Text] Munich, 20 Feb--Anyone who believes we merely need 
to wait for the next upswing in order to deal with the economic 
crisis will have a long wait. Germany will not be able to cope 
with recession and mass underemployment for some time because it 
has reacted to new challenges with old recipes and is continuing 
to do so. It has been resting on the laurels of the economic 
miracle and has failed to adapt to the rules of the new growth 
industries even as the its old industries are getting rid of 
more and more workers while production figures remain virtually 
the same. 
  These are the views of Leo Nefiodow of the Society for 
Mathematics and Data Processing in Bonn who traces the recession 
to the theory of long economic cycles, the so-called Kondratieff 
cycles, named after Nicolai Kondratieff who stated his concept 
in a 1926 article in the ARCHIV FUER SOZIALWISSENSCHAFT AND 
SOZIALPOLITIK [Archives of Social Science and Social Policy]. 
<H5>  The Dynamics of Growth </H5>
  According to this theory the economy is not only governed by 
short or medium-term cycles but also by growth cycles lasting 
some 50 years. They are the result of basic innovations such as 
the steam engine, electrical engineering, the automobile, or 
information technology which penetrate all areas of society. 
They sustain economic growth for decades and alter the ways in 
which societies organize themselves. Economies which were best 
at adapting to new rules and formulas for success and at making 
use of these fundamental innovations were able to offer good 
social services because of their leading technological position 
and to support large armies--such as 19th century England with 
the help of the steam engine, cotton, and steel. But because 
Great Britain held on to the coal and steel success formulas 
after 1890 and failed to adapt to the new challenges of the 
third Kondratieff cycle (electrical engineering and chemistry) 
and the fourth cycle as of 1950 (automobiles and petrochemicals) 
it was overtaken by the United States and Germany, Nefiodow says. 
<H5>  Doubling Every Six Years </H5>
  Now it is the Japanese who are technologically and thus 
economically ahead and will probably be forging ahead 
politically as well because they have made the best use of the 
causes of the reorganization process which the industrial 
nations have been going through since the seventies, i.e. 
information technology and its applications which is having an 
increasingly rapid and widespread impact on all sectors of 
society. In a world which doubles its knowledge every six years 
it is no longer a question of more information but one of 
administering information properly to quickly get at the 
information one needs, Nefiodow says. 
  In Japan, this led to economic growth independent of energy 
use while the largest German industries--automobiles, mechanical 
engineering, and chemistry--are part of the now-exhausted growth 
industries of the bygone, i.e. fourth Kondratieff cycle. 
Siemens-Nixdorf alone is holding its own on the world growth 
market of information technology in which the Japanese occupy a 
good to very good position with 20 companies. 
<H5>  Why We Are Behind </H5>
  Why has Germany missed the connection to the fifth 
Kondratieff cycle? Nefiodow thinks that an aversion to 
technology is to blame and above all the social, cultural, and 
societal customs and mannerisms which keep us from listening to 
and motivating each other and to work together--which are the 
major preconditions for an information society. Thus, the 
Japanese with their group ethic oriented toward the common good 
(for the company and its individual departments) were better 
able to adapt to the success formulas of the fifth Kondratieff 
cycle than the Europeans with their secularized, individualistic 
ethic. 
  This means that German enterprises must restructure their 
hierarchies and their hierarchical thinking and create teams 
which work together to solve complicated problems; teams in 
which information flows and can be applied quickly, in which 
small-time despots do not lord it over their colleagues and do 
not permit disputes to turn into power struggles which keep on 
festering until retirement. Everyone, regardless of rank, should 
be able to make a contribution in accordance with his/her 
knowledge and aptitude. The fifth Kondratieff cycle no longer 
calls for obedient, exchangeable workers but well-informed, 
loyal, and creative team players capable of interacting openly 
and cooperating with his colleagues. 
<H5>  Sixth Cycle Is Coming </H5>
  Nefiodow thinks Germany does not stand a chance of catching 
up with Japan during the fifth Kondratieff cycle. The 
government, he says, should stop subsidizing shipyards and coal 
mines--the growth industries of the initial Kondratieff 
cycles--out of the national debt and put money into the 
development of future growth markets instead. If and when the 
sixth Kondratieff cycle comes in the next millenium, it, too, 
will be sustained by basic innovations independent of energy 
use. Nefiodow believes that Germany should bet on this new 
long-term cycle whose outlines are already becoming apparent. 
The candidates of the sixth cycle are information, the 
environment, and health. 
<H5>  Well Prepared This Time Around </H5>
  Germany is extremely well prepared for the development and 
exploitation of these huge markets because of the high level of 
expertise in metal processing, metrology, control engineering, 
chemistry, software, and systems technology and above all 
because of the high degree of acceptance by the population of 
environmental, health amd information issues.

  [Text] Finance Minister Theo Waigel, Christian Social 
Union, wants to scrap federal financial support for AIDS 
information. Under the Finance Ministry's medium-term financial 
plan, expenditures on information about the illness and its 
prevention is to be reduced from 20 million German marks [DM] 
this year to zero by 1997. The Federal Central Office for 
Health Information, which will have to disband its AIDS 
department, is not the only organization that will be affected 
by the Bonn savings program. German AIDS Help, an umbrella 
organization to which 130 AIDS groupings belong, will also 
experience financial difficulty. As federal funds are to be 
reduced to DM16 million next year and to DM11 million in 1996, 
Waigel's officials want to cut down on the information campaign 
in the new laender above all. The argument is that there are 
still not that many AIDS cases there.

<F P=106> [Henrik Bork report: "China Presents Dissidents Like Pandas </F>
in the Zoo"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- He was arrested, sentenced, and 
forgotten. However, all of a sudden, China's rulers found Liu 
Gang, the 38-year-old former activist of the 1989 students' 
protests, useful to a certain extent again. Relations between 
Beijing and Washington are slightly strained because President 
Clinton is taking aim at human rights violations in China. A 
conciliatory gesture vis-a-vis the United States was needed. 
Thus, Beijing's propaganda experts remembered Liu Gang. 
  On Thursday of last week [3 March], Beijing selected five 
U.S. correspondents, picked them up from their homes in a 
minibus, and put them on the train from Beijing to Lingyuan. On 
Friday morning, they were allowed to visit the work camp 
Lingyuan Number Two -- one of six retraining camps in the 
godforsaken village 300 km northeast of Beijing. 
  "Through a tinted window on the second floor, we were 
allowed 
to see Liu Gang, who crossed the courtyard once with a guard," 
one of the reporters stated. "It is impossible to say anything 
about the state of his health." In a letter smuggled out of the 
camp about one year ago, Liu Gang mentioned torture and a 
festering rash on his face. 
  When the U.S. journalists wanted to speak to Liu, his guard, 
Xin Tingquan, stated: "We are not afraid of your seeing him. 
Yet Liu Gang tells lies. For this reason, he is not allowed to 
meet with anybody." Thus, it was only possible to see Liu from 
a distance, like a panda in the zoo. The propaganda show 
culminated in the presentation of a prisoner dance group that 
hopped to Michael Jackson's pop song "Bad." 
  Liu Gang's presentation was the most tasteless example of 
what the human rights organization Asiawatch describes as 
China's new "hostage policy" -- the release or the presentation 
of well-known political prisoners at important political moments 
that promise the greatest possible journalistic effect. The 
largely anonymous majority of prisoners of conscience is being 
forgotten, Asiawatch complains. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will certainly 
expect some gesture, no matter how dubious it may be from a 
moral viewpoint, when he arrives in Beijing this Friday. "Human 
rights are a priority on the agenda of my visit to China," 
Christopher announced a few days ago. 
  U.S. President Clinton has linked the extension of the 
most-favored-nation status, which is renewed every year, with 
"significant progress" in Beijing in the sphere of human rights. 
Christopher's report on his visit to China will be Clinton's 
major basis for a decision. The status grants China normal 
customs tariffs. If it should not be extended, China's textile 
exports to the United States would become much more expensive. 
Billions of dollars in bilateral trade would be in peril and 
tens of thousands of jobs would be lost in the United States and 
in China. Thus, this step would be tantamount to trade 
sanctions. 
  The debate about the most-favored-nation clause has been 
part 
of the summer show in the U.S. Congress since 1989. So far, the 
Sword of Damocles always hung over the Chinese for a few weeks 
without descending completely. The losses for U.S. and Hong 
Kong enterprises would have been too big. Year in year out they 
are paying the fees of a group of professional lobbyists who 
fight for a renewal of the clause and against sanctions against 
China. 
  This year, the variable is the new President. How serious is 
Clinton about human rights, which he advocated strongly during 
his election campaign against George Bush? He is now the 
President and "jobs, jobs, jobs" is all his compatriots are 
interested in. China might take revenge by discriminating 
against U.S. companies when placing orders for large economic 
projects. Beijing followed this principle recently when France 
concluded a weapons deal with Taiwan. 
  Neither of the two sides shows any flexibility. Clinton 
declared three weeks ago that China has made "some limited 
progress," which, however, is not yet sufficient. U.S. Human 
Rights Commissioner John Shattuck recently visited Beijing to 
remind the Chinese once again of all the individual points in 
Clinton's "executive order" on the most-favored-nation clause 
for China. The presidential decree of May 1993 calls for 
"significant progress" in the following areas: Release or 
information on the fate of political prisoners, guarantees for 
the humane treatment of prisoners -- by allowing inspections by 
international organizations, for example -- and the protection 
of the cultural and religious heritage of the Tibetans. It also 
demands an end to the jamming of international television and 
radio programs, freedom of emigration, and a ban on the export 
of goods to the United States that have been produced in Chinese 
prisons. 
  So far, China has hardly made any concessions, apart from 
propaganda videos and propaganda trips. Initial cautious 
negotiations with the International Red Cross on visits to 
prisons have not yielded any results. Officially, China rejects 
U.S. pressure on every occasion as "interference in the internal 
affairs of a sovereign state." Referring to human rights, Prime 
Minister Li Peng told the National People's Congress on Thursday 
that "China is against any kind of hegemonism." His statement 
was welcomed with strong applause by the approximately 3,000 
puppet delegates. 
  In a seeming effort to express its defiance vis-a-vis the 
United States, China's police arrested over a dozen dissidents 
in the runup to the visit and the session of "parliament" that 
began on Thursday. Some were released after the hour-long 
interrogations designed to intimidate them, but at least three 
are facing several-year prison terms. China's most well-known 
dissident, Wei Jingsheng, with whom Christopher would like to 
meet, has "departed" from Beijing under mysterious circumstances. 
  A clear change of course of the Chinese leadership in the 
sphere of human rights is unlikely in the near future, 
irrespective of the outcome of the visit by U.S. Secretary of 
State Christopher. After all, the power of the CPC depends on 
the intimidating effect of the Chinese gulag, as the 89-year-old 
patriarch Deng Xiaoping knows very well. To achieve this goal, 
the security organs frequently have to carry out raids during 
the night, and the fearless few like Liu Gang are arrested, 
sentenced, and forgotten.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "W.A.": "Snubbed in Beijing"] </F>
  [Text] What happened to the U.S. secretary of state in 
Beijing boils down to a humiliation of the leading Western 
power. Christopher's wish -- which was not even presented in a 
particularly sharp form -- that human rights be observed was 
answered in a way that almost had the effect of an insult. Not 
only was his visit overshadowed by the prosecution of a 
well-known Chinese human rights activist, Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen even accused the United States of violating laws: 
Beijing takes offense at U.S. human rights commissioner 
Shattuk's meeting with prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng a few 
days before Christopher's appearance. 
  What caused the Chinese rulers to behave in such an 
unfriendly way? What has driven them to make it almost 
impossible for U.S. President Clinton to agree to prolonging the 
preferential treatment of imports from China? It is true that 
Christopher should have known that Beijing would react 
particularly stubbornly to direct reproaches and is at best 
sometimes willing to give in tacitly after Western visitors have 
departed. However, no other U.S. secretary of state has met 
with such a cold snub in Beijing -- even though quite a lot is 
at stake for China's flourishing trade with the United States. 
Why, therefore, is it so unyielding? 
  Unlike Russia, China is not only potentially, but even now 
is 
a profitable market. Economic growth has reached dimensions 
that meanwhile even frighten the central planners. Therefore, 
however, the political leadership has become even more 
self-confident, even if the memory of the democracy movement 
that was so bloodily stifled a little less than five years ago 
may have a lasting effect and explain the nervousness with which 
the rulers react to even the smallest movements of the 
opposition. However, it is also part of this memory that the 
West, with an eye on the Chinese market, quickly forgave 
oppressors of the likes of Premier Li Peng. Beijing is also 
banking on exactly that this time -- and knows that U.S. 
businesses that are no less angry with Christopher for 
advocating the observance of human rights in China are on its 
side.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "heb": "Only on `Probation'"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese Government revealed its arrogance of 
power not by arresting people who think differently but by 
voicing one sentence. Wei Jingsheng is only a "criminal who has 
been released on probation," the government spokesman said 
during a visit to China by the U.S. secretary of state. 
  The disgust about such lies is part of the routine of 
foreign 
observers of China. On the other hand, arrests at night, 
threats, and long prison terms for some of them are "routine" 
for China's small group of dissidents, who are, however, 
becoming more active again. One became all the more conscious 
of that during Christopher's visit. Before, during, and after 
his visit there have been arrests, sentences, and torture in 
China. 
  If human rights were a topic like any other, Beijing would 
have won on points with its rebuff of Washington. The U.S. 
Administration must accept the accusation of once again having 
weakened its pressure concerning human rights with "mixed 
signals": While Christopher is talking about human rights, a 
high-ranking U.S. military officer is in China to negotiate 
about "military cooperation." 
  However, human rights are too serious an issue to leave them 
solely to the diplomats. Courageous Chinese, human rights 
organizations, "criminals released on probation," and others 
will have to continue their struggle for human rights also after 
the spectacle involving the extension of the most-favored-nation 
clause. This time, if at all, Beijing will be released only "on 
probation."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Detlef D. Pries: "Rebuff"] </F>
  [Text] "Disrespect of laws," "impertinence," "deeply 
disappointed," "most concerned" -- it is a long time since words 
like these were last heard in U.S.-Chinese diplomatic relations. 
Christopher went to Beijing to request respect for "The 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights," a respect to which Bill 
Clinton wants to link the most-favored-nation status for Chinese 
exports to the United States. However, the guest was coolly 
told that China had "a concept of its own" regarding human 
rights and -- if Washington could afford it at all -- Beijing 
could, if necessary, even do without that particular favor. 
  True, by the standards of the complacent West, one will 
hardly be able to approve of the way in which China treats 
political opponents. Whether such standards are applicable for 
the huge Middle Kingdom, however, remains dubious. In a 
nutshell, "China's concept" of human rights consists in 
guaranteeing an improvement of the living conditions for the 
more than 1 billion Chinese. A great deal remains to be done in 
this connection and Beijing will be measured by the Chinese 
themselves if and when it fulfills the promise. Experience has 
shown that no one can force a different concept on the Chinese 
leadership from the outside. Even less so if the advocates of 
"universal human rights" prove to be hypocritical. Did the 
United States care for human rights at all when the "Chinese 
card" could still be played as a trump against Moscow? And how 
would it want to guarantee the most primitive human rights if 
China were to experience catastrophes like the current ones in 
the crumbling Soviet State and in the Balkans?

<F P=106> [Peter Seidlitz commentary from Beijing: "More Important </F>
Issues"] 
  [Text] U.S. human rights policy toward China borders on 
cynicism. This was shown during the visit by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher to Beijing. The way the communists 
deal with people who think differently, who have different ideas 
and are rebellious, who want independent trade unions and demand 
freedom of speech and of the press, the uncomfortable people who 
face up to the state and are therefore removed from circulation 
-- allegedly, this was the most important issue on the human 
rights agenda that the U.S. chief diplomat broached in Beijing. 
  In fact, however, this is not true. By publicly insisting on 
the observance of international norms also in dealing with 
dissidents, the U.S. secretary of state mainly had an eye on his 
own audience in Washington. Congress and the Senate have linked 
trade and customs preferences via the most-favored-nation clause 
with better treatment of political prisoners, with visits to 
prisons, with stopping the production of goods for the U.S. 
market manufactured by prisoners in labor camps, with questions 
of the immigration of Chinese refugees, and with improvements in 
the situation in Tibet. 
  The U.S. Administration, which has landed in a dead end with 
its policy toward China, is now desperately trying to sell the 
skeptical Congress the claim that, at least in some areas, the 
human rights situation in China has improved over the previous 
year--because the United States needs China as a market. In 
China, Boeing is struggling against Airbus, the powerful U.S. 
telecommunications corporations are struggling against Siemens. 
Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler are competitors for a planned truck 
factory in Guangdong. Mercedes-Benz has even involved Chancellor 
Kohl in this project. Unexpectedly, German Foreign Minister 
Kinkel will soon go to Beijing again and, as one has heard, 
prepare a trip to Germany by head of government Li Peng, because 
the Chinese head of government will come to Bonn as the 
chancellor's guest before the Bundestag elections. Japan's Prime 
Minister Hosokawa has announced his visit to Beijing for next 
week, and France's Balladur will visit China in April. 
  Thus, the Americans rightly fear that Europeans and Japanese 
might compete with them for positions in China. This is 
particularly the case if the abolition of the 
most-favored-nation clause leads to a boycott of U.S. companies. 
However, the United States also needs the government in Beijing 
as a global player in the conflict settlement in the UN Security 
Council and as a security partner in Asia. In addition, the 
U.S. consumer would be punished if Chinese goods were burdened 
with penal duties. From the U.S. point of view, there are far 
more important issues than human rights. It is just that they 
are not mentioned so much. 
  "Common global and regional interests" determine the U.S. 
relationship with China. This is how Christopher summed up his 
talks in China. Regarding the way it deals with dissidents, 
China is prepared only for cosmetic corrections. It is 
unrealistic to expect anything else.

<F P=106> [Klaus Peter Krause commentary: "Club-Law in Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Is the news on the agreement in the U.S.-Japanese 
dispute over radio telephones news from the world of trade peace 
or trade war? One may disagree on this issue. In fact, the 
U.S. Administration is once again using the club in trade 
policy. President Bill Clinton has reenacted the Super 301 
clause of the U.S. trade law. It makes possible sanctions 
against the import of goods from countries that close their 
markets to U.S. goods and services. Thus, the U.S. 
Administration can impose high punitive tariffs on these 
imports. Yet a certain procedure has to be followed. It 
ensures that no rash decisions are made, and that there is 
enough time for negotiations and compromises. 
  Still, the threatening gesture has a certain impact -- as 
can 
be seen in connection with the radio telephone issue. Yet this 
behavior is not exactly a fair procedure in trade policies; it 
does not follow the principle that the international community 
has been trying to implement so long -- opening up markets on 
the basis of multilateral rules, not with the help of 
multilateral retaliatory strikes. 
  After all, it took seven years to adopt successfully new 
GATT 
rules for fair trade among the states. The results of the 
eighth GATT round -- the Uruguay Round -- that were achieved 
with difficulty are to be signed by the governments in Marrakesh 
in mid-April and to be ratified by the participants afterward. 
The agreement is based on the principle of multilaterality, 
which also applies to conflicts between two countries. 
Washington simply ignores this rule. 
  The agreement restricts U.S. leeway for unilateral 
sanctions. 
In fact, it has not yet entered into force and the United 
States is not yet obliged to observe it. However, it would be 
wise for the largest trade power to respect the spirit of the 
GATT agreement already at this point instead of violating it in 
such an obvious manner and of undermining it before it is 
signed. Moreover, this affects U.S. credibility as a power that 
strongly advocates free trade. It is important for the United 
States to strengthen its credibility because it is not exactly a 
shining example as far as fending off undesirable import 
competition at home is concerned. 
  Japan, too, is not enthusiastic about opening up its markets 
for free trade. Yet the United States is threatening the 
government in Tokyo in such a way that one has the impression 
that stubborn Japan is barricading itself against the goods that 
the United States wants to export, with high protective tariffs, 
quotas, import bans, and other classical protectionist measures. 
Yet this is not true at all (with the exception of rice, which, 
however, is not an issue at present). The goods reach Japan 
unimpeded, but it is difficult or impossible to sell them there. 
  One reason for that is restraint of competition in the 
Japanese market, partly carried out by the state and partly by 
private enterprises. The restrictions by the state include 
vague regulations, complicated provisions governing aliens' 
registration, the preferential treatment of Japanese enterprises 
in public invitations to bid, arbitrariness on the part of the 
authorities, additional examination of products, delayed 
permits, other technical requirements, and similar things. 
  Some of these barriers naturally result from the realities 
in 
Japan, which exist everywhere, including the United States, and 
which are not aimed at impeding import competition. Yet they 
have this effect. Some measures, however, are designed to serve 
this goal. It is clear and quite understandable that Washington 
is trying to urge the Japanese Government to remove these 
barriers. This also applies to restrictions in the private 
sector, including cartels aimed at allocating market shares and 
regulations that partly or completely deny importers access to 
the market. However, Japanese "newcomers" also suffer from 
these rules. A stricter policy on competition by the state is 
required in this respect. 
  Another reason that makes it difficult for exporters to 
sell their goods in the Japanese market is naturally foreign 
peculiarities which have to be handled by foreign suppliers 
everywhere. They include the Japanese mentality, the behavior 
and regulations prevailing there, the foreign language and 
characters, the complicated trade and sales network, developed 
personal relationships, exclusive contracts between subsuppliers 
and the production industry, old habits, different industrial 
structures, and the different tastes of consumers. All these 
and many other things make it extraordinarily difficult for 
foreigners to carry out business. In other words: These are 
advantages that domestic competitors always enjoy at home and 
which are not condemnable at all. 
  The United States, however, behaves as though the Japanese 
Government should also eliminate these natural peculiarities 
because they limit "fair competition." What it does not say is 
that the Japanese are facing similar difficulties in the United 
States, but that the Japanese apparently find it much easier to 
adapt. Another aspect that the United States ignores is that 
there are foreign companies that have succeeded in gaining a 
foothold in Japan, despite the fact that they were confronted 
with the same problems. Thus, they must be more skillful in 
offering their products and in their behavior, which means that 
they must be more competitive. 
  Clearing the path forcibly for U.S. enterprises which are 
not 
capable of adapting to the situation by means of official U.S. 
pressure on Japan, by urging fixed import quotas and market 
shares does not correspond to the spirit and meaning of free 
trade. Washington believes that it is right in its dispute with 
Japan, which is partly justified, but it is trying to manipulate 
trade, resorting to club-law. Both sides are exaggerating. The 
Japanese Government is wriggling like an eel. The truth is that 
the market in Japan is much less closed than Washington claims.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Isnard: "Secret Services and French Arms </F>
Manufacturers Have Difficulty Cooperating in Foreign Markets"] 
  [Text] A number of France's weapons manufacturers and its 
intelligence services are currently involved in a 
misunderstanding at best or a divorce at worst. Without actually 
proclaiming it from the rooftops, the former are not above 
accusing the latter of being of no use to them at all in the 
cut-throat competition that pits them against their main rival, 
the United States. The latter have willingly condemned the arms 
industry's inability to work with discretion, while castigating 
its propensity for being a blabbermouth in a world in which 
secrecy is the rule. 
  The attitude of certain French arms firms stems from deals 
in 
Asia and the Pacific and the Near or Middle East, where they 
feel that over the course of the past few months, the General 
Foreign Security Directorate (DGSE) has not given them the 
support they expect from its officers in the field. If one is to 
believe the arms merchants, the intelligence services are 
unable--when they so request--to provide them, in time and with 
sufficient precision or even evidence, with information on the 
precise nature of the proposals submitted to foreign customers 
by their American rivals. The DGSE is supposed to have somewhat 
legal and occasionally even clandestine means to gain access to 
such files. 
  For the arms builders in question, this accusation could 
serve as an alibi for failures vis-a-vis a competitor whom they 
suspect of not sparing any means to win the contract. This 
explanation of the divorce between the DGSE and certain French 
firms remains plausible, but is not sufficient since 
intelligence officials tacitly recognize (without singling out 
any one manufacturer) that it may well be recriminations that 
they are hearing. Nevertheless, they hasten to return the ball 
to the other court. 
<H5>  Excessively Lax, Even Imprudent </H5>
  At the root of this controversy is the so-called affair of 
the "leaks" in March 1993, on the heels of the legislative 
elections in France, when the American press published documents 
implicating the DGSE in acts of industrial, technological or 
economic espionage in the United States. The accusations 
generated strong tension in intelligence communities on both 
sides of the Atlantic (LE MONDE, 4 June 1993), damaged relations 
between the DGSE and the CIA, and forced the new "boss" of 
French intelligence, Jacques Dewattre, to try to restore ties 
with his American counterparts on a different basis. 
  Although the documents, some of which had been doctored from 
what were initially authentic elements, did not emanate from the 
DGSE directly, everything led French agents to believe that the 
sending of the material to American interlocutors was the work 
of industrial sources that either blundered or acted out of 
spite. Whatever the case, the DGSE began to distrust the French 
industrial world, particularly the aeronautics and arms 
industry, which stands accused of not being able to hold its 
tongue and of being too lax in its exchanges with other 
countries, when not openly taxed with imprudence at best and a 
deliberate intent to do harm at worst. 
  From this arises the current limitations placed on the 
transmission of certain "sensitive" intelligence to 
manufacturers who want to know the position of their rival 
exporters across the Atlantic and, in particular, the secrets of 
their proposals compared with French bids. From this the 
discontent of major firms in the face of what seems to them to 
be a deliberate and discriminatory retention of its information 
by the DGSE has also developed. 
<H5>  Reorientation of Missions </H5>
  The whole affair would be no more than an anecdote if it did 
not actually reveal how difficult it will be to handle the 
transformation which most intelligence services in the world 
undertook at the end of the Cold War between the East and West. 
Like its foreign counterparts, the DGSE works less and less on 
military intelligence strictly speaking and now gives priority 
to gathering information of a more political, economic, 
financial, banking, scientific, industrial or commercial nature. 
Today, the quest for so-called defense intelligence makes up 
only 20 percent of the DGSE's overall activities. 
  This reorientation of missions poses the problem of knowing 
to whom to transmit information obtained in these new "niches." 
When the DGSE intercepts documents on GATT, as it did during the 
recent trade negotiations between Europe and the United States, 
there is little uncertainty about the final destination of the 
dossier in question. But when the DGSE reads a message on the 
long-term strategy of a foreign firm that might threaten the 
activity of its French rivals, who should be informed? The 
State, meaning the Elysee and the government through the 
agencies directly involved? Or certain specially designated 
ministries? Or, more directly, the national or private 
enterprise in the sector involved, provided that the 
intelligence services--which have no mandate to do so--interfere 
in the French industrial fabric by giving preference to one 
company over another in the same sphere of activity? The 
questions go unanswered. 
  In practice, the intelligence services in France and abroad 
seek to identify a hand-picked official, the duly-empowered CEO 
or general manager, to come consult the file on site, even 
refusing the right to photocopy the document. 
  All things considered, it is a delicate affair. It is not 
always enough to allay the vigilance of intelligence 
professionals, now distrustful of anyone not sharing their 
natural or excessive obsession with secrecy. It has also 
occurred to manufacturers that they would henceforth be better 
served by setting up their own intelligence networks or by 
calling upon the services of professionals!

  [Excerpt] [Minister of Defense] Francois Leotard just lost 
the chance of being Jacques Chirac's minister of defense 
someday, and he has every reason to congratulate himself. First, 
because the feverish interest in military issues demonstrated by 
the Rally for the Republic's (RPR) natural candidate would make 
the job very sensitive under his tutelage. Secondly, his 
fixation on resuming nuclear testing augurs poorly for his 
diplomatic discernment. The Leotard side offered itself the 
pleasure of noting it for future reference, under guise of 
ironic advice to the aspiring president of the republic: when 
one occupies this job, it is better to remember that France does 
not live alone in this world, unless one wishes to put one's 
government (and eventually one's country) in an untenable 
situation. In other words, if the Americans and the Russians 
persist in abolishing nuclear testing, it is not in the best 
political interest to oppose such praiseworthy intentions by 
insisting on resuming ours, of whose urgent usefulness, 
moreover, not all experts are equally convinced. However, the 
present priority of the RPR leader is of course more prosaic. It 
is less important to publicize one's own defense project than to 
show that the prime minister lacks one because of cohabitational 
collusion. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Weakened GATT"] </F>
  [Text] It is a serious commercial weapon that President 
Clinton exhumed by reestablishing on 3 March and for a two-year 
duration the dispositions of the trade law called "Super 301" 
with a view to reducing the gigantic Japanese trade surplus with 
the United States. Applied for the first time between 1988 and 
1990 to force Washington's trade partners to open their markets 
to U.S. products, it proved its efficiency, particularly against 
Japan which, at the time, was already in Washington's line of 
sight. Recommended by congressional officials, its 
re-establishment through a presidential decree will please a 
U.S. public opinion that is sensitive to a measure which, 
according to Mr Clinton, will "create jobs" on the other side of 
the Atlantic. 
  The escalation tactics that Washington decided to adopt 
toward Japan are nevertheless inopportune. They create an 
impasse in the very unequal state of health of the two principal 
economic powers of the world. The United States' strong growth 
stimulates imports, while Japan, faced with a recession 
unprecedented since the end of the war, is applying the brakes 
on imports. Part of the U.S. deficit ought to be ascribed to the 
present gap. 
  It is also inopportune for President Clinton to take it out 
on a Japanese prime minister already seriously weakened 
domestically, especially at a time when the Japanese Government 
promises to open significantly the Japanese market to foreign 
competition, against the opinion of part of the administration. 
  Japan is not alone in having to worry about U.S. actions. 
This is true also of Mexico and Canada, now linked to Washington 
by a free-trade agreement. It is equally true of the Europe of 
the Twelve. Beyond the fact that the Americans would sell more 
to Japan to the detriment of the European Union, it is the 
edifice that was laboriously constructed thanks to the GATT 
during the Uruguay Round negotiations that appears threatened. 
  The EU [European Union] countries--and France more than 
others--have insisted on the major advance represented by the 
creation of a World Trade Organization to replace the GATT. 
Responsible for smoothing out future trade conflicts, this 
organization is supposed to mark the end of "bilateralism," and 
thus deprive the United States of the right to impose its law on 
less powerful partners. A month and a half away from the 
official signing of the final act of the Uruguay Round, the 
reestablishment of "Super 301" proves that Washington intends to 
preserve its full freedom of action.

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F>
Fini by Gianni Pennacchi in Rome; date not given: "Fini: `We 
Will Conquer the South'" -- first two paragraphs are 
L'INDIPENDENTE introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- To whom will the south go? To us, of 
course. [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini is so sure of 
crushing his opponents from Rome that these days he is scouring 
the far north in an attempt to eat into the votes of Bossi, "the 
Attila of national politics." He makes no secret of the reason 
for this: If the League ends up being a minority in the 
center-right line up, Fini will be the one to lay down the 
conditions for governing. With [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi, of course, with whom he seems to be in full 
agreement even though he did not manifest a great deal of 
solidarity in the Publitalia affair. 
  It is a victorious Fini who is speaking. You people should 
not be splitting hairs over the fact that there are already too 
many shouts of victory during these last phases of the election 
campaign. Yesterday the National Alliance leader was in Udine 
and Gorizia. As usual he laid the blame on [Northern League 
Secretary] Bossi, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, and [Italian 
Popular Party Secretary] Martinazzoli. Then, perhaps because of 
the proximity of the border, he relaunched an attack on Italy's 
shattered rights in Istria. Japan, which is a democratic 
country like ours can try to get the Kuril Islands back from 
Russia "solely by diplomatic means," of course. Whereas Italy 
should not even worry about compensation for all those who were 
obliged to abandon Istria at the end of the war. 
  [Pennacchi] Fini, you really do not want to let go on 
Italian 
Istria? 
  [Fini] It is a matter of principle that must be assessed as 
such and that does not bring any immediate consequences. I have 
been thinking a great deal about his: We must look to Japan as 
an example. I am asking to open diplomatic talks, not war. 
  [Pennacchi] Are you not afraid that raising the Istrian 
issue 
again could create problems with Berlusconi? 
  [Fini] I do not think so. Even so, I could not care less if 
the things in which I believe create problems. This matter is 
entirely free of consequences, except for those who are totally 
in bad faith. I am laying down the problem as a whole, so that 
matters that can be resolved are discussed in concrete terms: 
the problem of the goods that were expropriated, that of 
safeguarding the Italian language, of maintaining cultural 
institutions that have been eradicated. 
  [Pennacchi] "Attila" Bossi you said yesterday. If you 
continue in this way, and even if the progressives lose, you 
will end up being unable to govern because of too many exchanges 
of insults. 
  [Fini] I have never declared war, neither am I waging one. I 
only feel the need to explain why an agreement was not possible 
in the north. 
  [Pennacchi] Okay, but let us face it. If you win, you will 
have to govern together. 
  [Fini] Everything depends on the voters, they are the ones 
who will establish the power relationship. If a power 
relationship is balanced out with the League, which is the 
easiest of the three, Bossi will clearly have to come off his 
high horse. 
  [Pennacchi] To do this you will have to double your victory 
in the south. 
  [Fini] We will have an extremely good result in the south. 
But even the north will give us some nice satisfaction. I went 
to a meeting in Arezzo where there were 5,000 people, more than 
Fanfani attracted in 1948. There is a revolt against the old 
system. National Alliance is a credible alternative. 
  [Pennacchi] What relationship do you foresee between 
yourself 
and Berlusconi for those elected in the center-south? 
  [Fini] Unlike the others, when I sign an accord I respect 
it. 
Therefore, I am not concerned about whether Forza Italia or 
National Alliance will take the lion's share. The important 
thing is that the pole does its utmost. 
  [Pennacchi] Are you convinced that you will be the strongest 
in the south? 
  [Fini] Yes, certainly. 
  [Pennacchi] Your accord with Berlusconi seems perfect but 
you 
left him alone with little or no solidarity in the clash with 
Judge Colombo [on Fininvest investigations]. 
  [Fini] I never generalize, I do not consider it right to say 
"the judicial authorities...." The magistrates are all the 
same. However, there are undoubtedly shortsighted magistrates 
who see very little when they must investigate to the left and 
are quite farsighted when they investigate in other directions. 
  [Pennacchi] And as far as separating careers in the 
magistracy is concerned? 
  [Fini] This is sacrosanct. There are three fundamental 
aspects of reform: freeing the Higher Council of the Magistracy 
from political party influence; abolishing automatic career 
advancements; and separating the careers of the judges from the 
public prosecutors. 
  [Pennacchi] What will happen after the elections? 
  [Fini] The winner will govern. Not any hypothetical body of 
married institutions, therefore the voters must be careful: Any 
vote for Segni or Martinazzoli is the photocopy of a vote for 
Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left]. 
  [Pennacchi] So, let us return to Bossi. If you win, will you 
succeed in staying together? 
  [Fini] The voters must decide who will have more power in 
the 
pole of freedoms. The ones with more power will lay down the 
rules for the government. And since I am convinced that it will 
not be Bossi, I am very, very calm.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Saavedra Accuses People's Party of </F>
`Alarmism Over Autonomy'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Minister of Public Administration 
Jeronimo Saavedra yesterday attacked some People's Party leaders 
for transmitting "alarmism" over autonomy that does not fit the 
facts. He said -- and we quote: "There is no question of 
tearing up any map or territory, as might be deduced from the 
alarmism that some People's Party leaders wish to transmit to 
the public." 
  Saavedra advocated the path of "calm, tranquillity, and 
mutual respect" in order to achieve the impetus to autonomy to 
which Felipe Gonzalez committed himself in his investiture 
speech and which will enable the autonomous communities to 
achieve the maximum level of powers recognized by the 
Constitution and their respective autonomy statutes. 
  The minister asserted that the government will not negotiate 
Aznar's autonomy proposal in its current form and that it will 
continue to implement its own policy. As will be recalled, 
Saavedra has described as "simplistic" and "underdeveloped" the 
autonomy proposal that the People's Party presented in Barcelona 
and asserted that an issue as complex as building the state of 
the autonomous communities cannot be reduced to a proposal that 
seeks the standardization of powers of all the communities 
within two legislative terms and that recognizes only a few 
distinctive features. 
  In this connection, Saavedra clearly distanced himself from 
the People's Party strategy of finalizing the autonomy framework 
by stating that the state of the autonomous communities is 
always being built, "like it or not." But Saavedra's line 
hardened even further when he added that "if this (approach) is 
shared by the other political forces, I am delighted for 
everybody; if not, let everybody implement the autonomy policy 
that he deems most opportune." 
  In his opinion, it is clear that the People's Party does not 
have a serious and well-developed autonomy proposal on which to 
sit down and negotiate, since its document does not specify the 
distinctive features or define points as important as the 
matters that are nontransferable and those that can be 
transferred to the autonomous communities. 
  Nevertheless, he especially emphasized the government's 
desire to reach agreement with the People's Party on the 
so-called democratic impetus and the "local pact." According to 
the minister, the latter agreement will bring about a real 
decentralization of the state's public expenditure, which will 
make our country one of the most decentralized in the world. In 
this connection, he agreed with [Catalan president] Jordi Pujol 
that the distribution of expenditure must be in keeping with the 
level of powers assumed by each of the state's administrations. 
  Last, the minister would not assess the Federation of 
Municipalities' new demands for powers and played down its 
threat to curb the turnabout in autonomy unless there is 
previously a municipal pact.

<F P=106> [M. Abizanda report: "Vargas Acknowledges Operational </F>
Problems in Armed Forces Owing to Budgetary and Management 
Reasons"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- The defense minister acknowledged 
yesterday that the existence of operational problems in the 
Armed Forces is a result of the budget cuts and management of 
resources. Garcia Vargas appeared at a secret session before the 
Congress [of Deputies] Defense Committee to report on the Armed 
Forces' effectiveness and stated that the greatest danger for 
Spain stems from local centers of tension in a very specific 
area -- the Mediterranean. 
  The defense minister's remarks centered on two matters -- 
the 
units' effectiveness and the new Spanish strategic approach 
resulting from the profound international changes of the past 
few years. On the latter point, the minister explained that our 
country does not have to face up to situations of global danger, 
stemming from the former Cold War atmosphere between blocs. 
However, he did acknowledge that Spain must assess hypothetical 
situations in a very specific area -- the Mediterranean -- that 
have a certain degree of probability of occurring. These 
dangers concern the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the 
southern Mediterranean countries and the current conflict in the 
Balkans. However, he took the view that these dangers can in no 
way be imminent threats. 
  The minister explained that although the new Joint Strategic 
Plan is pending, the lack of it has been covered by two 
documents -- the National Defense Directive and the Military 
Defense Directive -- and that the planning cycle will be 
restored over the next few months. 
<H5>  Differentiate Between Units </H5>
  The minister also referred, as he explained to journalists, 
to the Armed Forces' operational situation. In this connection, 
he emphasized the need to differentiate between the various 
units comprising the Armed Forces -- especially the Army -- and 
said that those comprising the Rapid Action Forces, the Reaction 
Forces, and the Territorial Defense Forces are not the same 
thing. 
  In this connection, he stated that the first two are 
equipped 
and have "acceptable effectiveness," whereas he acknowledged 
grave shortfalls in equipment and human resources in the 
Territorial Defense Forces. In fact, these units will be the 
basis on which the mobile reserve will be formed when the 
redeployment plans currently under consideration are set in 
motion. 
  Garcia Vargas stressed that the process of concentrating 
units envisaged in the redeployment plans (the Army will pass 
from the current 20 brigades, including the garrisons outside 
the peninsula, to 15) will cause the units to be better provided 
with equipment and human resources. "The quantity will be less, 
but the quality will be better," he asserted, and asked for the 
current situation to be compared with that of 10 years ago. He 
also asserted that the Armed Forces' problems are not only 
budgetary but also those of personnel, management, and 
organization. 
  With respect to the Navy and Air Force, the minister 
acknowledged shortfalls in some of the main combat forces. In 
the case of the former, these shortfalls mainly affect those 
units that are not among the Navy's current priorities, which 
are the escort and transport ships. Those most affected by the 
cuts are the submarines, in which the delays in major refits of 
some of them -- the latest being the S-64, Narval -- have caused 
a lag in the Submarine Force's operational cycle. 
  As far as the Air Force is concerned, the main problems 
center on the Mirage F1's. As People's Party Defense Committee 
spokesman Santiago Lopez Valdivielso pointed out at a previous 
appearance, these aircraft had been barred from flying for more 
than two hours on safety grounds, and it has also been advised 
that they do not exceed 1,100 km per hour (650 knots). Part of 
the F-18 fleet is currently undergoing a "retrofit" (later 
modifications without going through the assembly line) at the 
Zaragoza base, in order to update all the aircraft to the F-18A 
"plus" model. 
  The Air Force also faces problems of lack of fuel and 
ammunition. On this point, the defense minister explained that 
a major effort has been made over the past few months to correct 
these shortfalls, and right now the situation is beginning to be 
acceptable. 
  The fuel shortage has also caused the Armed Forces to fall 
short of the standard set by NATO as far as proper training on 
maneuvers is concerned. In this connection, maneuvers have been 
substantially reduced, and in some cases have had to be made up 
for by real-life exercises, such as the participation in the UN 
mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina or the presence of ships in the 
NATO fleets in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. [passage

  [Excerpts] According to studies commissioned by the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry, the advantages of Finnish 
membership in the European Union [EU] would outweigh the 
disadvantages. A strengthening of the Finnish economy is 
mentioned as an advantage of EU membership, while the adaptation 
of farming is regarded as a disadvantage. [passage omitted] 
  Only now is a special working group going to start drafting 
a 
detailed study on the effects of the EU settlement on Finnish 
farming. [passage omitted] 
  The other studies published today see the advantages of 
Finnish EU membership as greater than the disadvantages, which 
is probably no great surprise. The advantages mentioned are an 
increase in investments, participation in the EU's joint trade 
policy and other decisionmaking processes, and a strengthening 
of the foreign and security policy. But the latter is also 
linked with great problems, in addition to farming, depending on 
whether Europe is moving toward integration or division and on 
what Russia's position in Europe will be. 
  With EU membership, Finland would say farewell to the policy 
of neutrality. According to a study commissioned by the 
Ministry of Trade and Industry, as a member of the EU, Finland 
could not pursue the policy of neutrality as it did in earlier 
years. According to the same study carried out by the Foreign 
Policy Institute, outside the EU, the only alternative remaining 
for Finland would be a policy of neutrality, whose pursuit, 
however, would be more difficult than in the Cold War era. The 
study stresses that as a member of the EU, Finland could expect 
support for the security policy and solidarity from the other 
member countries.

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report: "New Poll: Forty-Five Percent </F>
of Finns Support EU Membership"] 
  [Text] Almost half, or 45 percent, of Finns favor joining 
the European Union (EU), according to a poll taken after 
conclusion of accession talks last Tuesday [1 March]. According 
to the poll results announced on Finnish Broadcasting Company's 
TV news program, 27 percent of respondents opposed membership. 
Another 27 percent were in the "don't know" category. 
  Commissioned by Television News, the poll was conducted by 
Taloustutkimous OY last Wednesday -- or the day after the 
accession talks were concluded. Some 1,000 Finns were asked 
whether Finland should join the EU, based on the outcome of the 
negotiations. 
  The margin of error for the poll is in the 3-percent range. 
  According to the poll, the typical supporter of membership 
is 
engaged in intellectual work [henkinen tyo] and is in a 
leadership positions. He is a resident of Uusimaa province and 
under 40 years old. 
  In contrast, the typical opponent is a rural area farmer or 
worker, most often retired, living in the northern or 
southwestern areas of the country, or in Hame province. 
  It was found that deciding on a position regarding the EU is 
extremely difficult for pensioners. 
  Regarding specifically the outcome of Finland's 
negotiations, 
1 percent saw the results as "excellent," 41 percent as 
"satisfactory," and 12 percent as "poor." 
  Television News intends to follow opinion trends about once 
a 
month until the referendum this fall.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Christer Larsson] </F>
  [Text] Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn is backing 
down from previous statements and is now saying that there may 
have been some form of hidden military cooperation between 
Finland and Sweden. Her changed view follows an interview this 
morning by "The Echo" program with Kaarlo Pitsinki, party 
secretary of the Finnish Social Democrats in the Sixties, who 
himself also took part in the secret military cooperation 
between Finland and Sweden. 
  Kaarlo Pitsinki, party secretary of the Finnish Social 
Democrats in the Sixties and provincial governor until 1982, 
told the "Morning Echo" that he himself had worked for Swedish 
military espionage in Finland directed against the Soviet Union. 
But he also confirmed that the chiefs of Finland's own 
espionage and counterespionage were those who handled the 
regular military intelligence cooperation with Sweden. "The 
Echo" has reported on this three times in the past, with the 
help of Swedish sources. Finnish Defense Minister Elisabeth 
Rehn has three times put her own defense chiefs against the wall 
in order, as she says, to find out the truth. Her own defense 
chiefs have three times denied all forms of hidden military 
cooperation, even with Sweden. After this, they declared that 
if the information obtained by "The Echo" turned out to be true, 
it would be such a scandal that either the defense leadership or 
she herself would have to resign. This is what Kaarlo Pitsinki 
had to say about that this morning: 
  [Begin Pitsinki recording] She is speaking against her 
better 
judgment (?or) she is in the wrong job. [end recording] 
  [Larsson] This is what Elisabeth Rehn tells "The Echo" 
today. 
  [Begin Rehn recording] I must again come back to what 
Pitsinki is saying, namely that I am evidently in the wrong job 
since I am not familiar with my own military and my own defense 
force. Yet, I would like to claim that among the defense 
ministers in Finland I am probably better informed than many of 
how we work. [end recording] 
  [Larsson] Now, for the first time, the Finnish defense 
minister is also beginning to back down from her previously 
categorical position, which was that there was never any hidden 
military cooperation in any form, even with Sweden, during the 
Cold War. 
  [Begin recording] [Rehn] I might perhaps not be surprised if 
one thing or the other occurred in the fifties between persons 
with different interests, but as for later periods, I would be 
very surprised if anything like that could be documented, if it 
happened. 
  [Larsson] The sixties, seventies? 
  [Rehn] Very surprised. 
  [Larsson] But do you want to rule it out? 
  [Rehn] I have learned that you must never say never about 
anything, but I would like to say that I find it extremely alien 
[words indistinct] claimed here, but as I say, I am no expert. 
I find it very strange to have to speculate about something I 
am definitely not an expert. Ask me about today's defense and 
that of the future and I will be very expert on that. 
  [Larsson] And nothing is going on today? 
  [Rehn] There is no established cooperation between our 
defense and foreign nations. Whether there is any individual -- 
no one can know. [end recording] 
  [Larsson] That was Elisabeth Rehn. Kaarlo Pitsinki has 
himself many times wondered why official Finland continues to 
pretend that there was never any regular intelligence 
cooperation, even with Sweden. 
  [Begin recording] [Pitsinki] I have been wondering about 
that, I have been wondering about precisely that. She must know 
about the regular cooperation. 
  [Larsson] Why is it so important, then, to deny this 
cooperation? For the sake of the Russians? 
  [Pitsinki] That is the only reason. 
  [Larsson] Does anybody believe that this is unknown in 
Moscow? 
  [Pitsinki] No, I don't think so, it is part of the act. [end 
recording]

mainly beer lovers. Several retail stores ran out of beer last 
week and some restaurants, specializing in the sale of 
medium-strength beer, have already had to close their doors. In 
other respects, there have been sufficient quantities of food in 
the shops so far. This morning, all the basic necessities were 
still available almost as normal, but the situation may become 
somewhat more difficult in the next few days. The employers' 
organization in the food industry thinks that processed meat and 
fresh meat will disappear from the stores at the end of the week 
if the strike continues.

<F P=106> [Article by Gosta Karlsson: "Environmental Research in </F>
Danger: Contribution to EU May Force Reductions"] 
  [Text] Swedish environmental research is in danger of large 
cutbacks as Sweden moves closer to the EU [European Union]. 
Sweden's contribution to the EU's research program will eat up 
more than half of the National Environmental Protection Board's 
appropriation for environmental research here at home. 
  This is what Erik Fellenius, head of research at the 
National 
Environmental Protection Board (SNV), says. He believes that 
the government should distribute the EU payment to more Swedish 
authorities and research councils that finance research on the 
environment. 
<H5>  Increased Influence </H5>
  In 1992, when Rolf Annerberg, the general director of the 
National Environmental Protection Board, turned his 
environmental research study in to the government, SNV warned 
that national environmental research goals could not be achieved 
within the budget framework that the government set at that time 
for environmental research. 
  Two years ago, 20 million from SNV's budget went to the EU 
research program "Environment." In fiscal year 1995-96, between 
70 and 100 million kronor from of SNV's total purse of 155 
million will go to research projects decided upon by the EU. 
  "Even if we get increased influence over the EU's research 
program, we cannot be sure that Sweden's special research needs 
will be satisfied. At issue are research on acidification, the 
salmon disease M74, and other things. The research program that 
we need to form a basis for arguments in international 
environmental negotiations is in danger of suffering serious 
reductions," says Erik Fellenius. 
<H5>  Spread the Contribution </H5>
  He believes the government should distribute the EU 
contribution to more Swedish financiers, for example the 
Business and Technical Development Board (Nutek), the Science 
Research Council, and the Forestry and Agricultural Research 
Council.

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Policy Discussed </H5>
  Writing in the 20 February Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, K.I. 
Angelopoulos focuses on the U.S. recognition of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. It is difficult to 
believe that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs failed to understand the U.S. diplomatic 
language in recent months and were surprised when Washington 
established diplomatic relations with Skopje, Angelopoulos 
contends. It is equally difficult to accept that U.S. policy 
could suddenly change in a few days. The United States "never 
promised Athens anything," he continues, and the only element in 
doubt was the timing of the formal recognition, which had been 
rumored in Athens diplomatic circles to occur "within a matter 
of weeks at most." The Papandreou government's 18 February 
statement that the U.S. State Department had assured Athens on 1 
February that recognition would not take place is a "timid" 
attempt at projecting an image of a Greek Government "deceived" 
by U.S. diplomacy and "fails to convince anyone," Angelopoulos 
asserts. 
  The "Athens-Washington big love-in" has surely been 
interrupted, Angelopoulos continues, for U.S. positions on the 
FYROM issue are "clearly aggressive toward and critical of 
Greece." Despite official attempts by U.S. Ambassador Thomas 
Niles to preserve good relations between the two countries, a 
large segment of the Greek population believes the United States 
is responsible for recent developments. However, Papandreou does 
not want relations to worsen in view of his scheduled April 
visit to the United States. Meanwhile, there are good reasons to 
think that following the "break" caused by Papandreou's 
announcement of the embargo against FYROM, initiatives aimed at 
an Athens-Skopje dialogue will "fatefully" emerge, perhaps 
leading to lifting the Greek embargo, as the Americans are 
requesting, Angelopoulos notes. While this is the most 
optimistic scenario, developments related to other Balkan 
problems may still complicate matters for a Greek foreign policy 
"not noted for long-term, cool-headed planning," as well as for 
Greece's European Union partners and Washington diplmats, whose 
Balkan policies have thus far "lacked accuracy and stability," 
Angelopoulos concludes. 
  The issue of U.S.-Greek relations is also discussed by 
Alexis 
Papakhelas, I KATHIMERINI's Washington correspondent, in the 20 
February issue of the newspaper. Papakhelas concludes that 
Greece can no longer expect from the United States a positive 
attitude in the FYROM issue for the following reasons: 
  l. As good as President Clinton's personal intentions may 
be, 
he does not conduct President George Bush's kind of personal 
diplomacy. 
  2. The U.S. State Department bureaucracy has a "negative" 
view of Greek policy because of past difficulties in 
Greek-American relations during the 1981-89 Papandreou 
administration, as well as because of its "obvious" sympathy and 
concern about Turkey and FYROM. 
  3. Arguing that ethnic groups cannot determine U.S. policy, 
professional diplomats "abhor" interventions by the 
Greek-American lobby, which has mobilized on behalf of Greece. 
  While the United States supports Greece as a friend and 
ally, 
"it does so only on issues not involving a third country," 
Papakhelas concludes. 
<H5>  Poll Results </H5>
  As late as 13 February, but before U.S. recognition of The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I KATHIMERINI published 
the results of a 26-27 January poll conducted by the ALKO-MARTEL 
polling organization, with a commentary by Yiannis Loulis [no 
further information]. Respondents were asked their opinion on 
continuing a dialogue with FYROM in the United Nations. 
According to Loulis, results showed an "impressive" turn in 
public opinion in favor of a more measured attitude toward the 
FYROM issue. In fact, the number of partisans of a dialogue in 
the United Nations increased from 77.2 percent last December to 
the present 80.9 percent, while those who opposed it decreased 
from 19.5 percent in December to 14.2 percent in January. 
Respondents were also asked what could "realistically" be 
expected from such a dialogue. Some 31.8 percent thought that 
80-90 percent of Greece's expectations could be met, 27.3 
percent thought that 60-70 percent of Greek expectations could 
be satisfied, 10.3 percent that success would be total, 14.9 
percent that few expectations could be met, and 7.5 percent did 
not know. 
<H5>  Economic Repercussions </H5>
  An article by Athina Kalaitzoglou in the 20 February I 
KATHIMERINI reviews commercial relations between Greece and 
FYROM and comments on economic losses FYROM will sustain from 
the Athens-imposed embargo. Forty percent of basic goods, 
including food items, enter FYROM from Greece and 70 percent of 
imports-exports transit through the port of Salonica. In 1993, 
FYROM imported through Greece 1.5 million tons of hydrocarbons, 
487,000 tons of raw materials (zinc, manganese, and various 
alloys), 101,000 tons of phosphates, and 118,000 tons of 
coal--also, 8,500 tons of coffee, 5,000 tons of leather goods, 
and 473 tons of cigarettes. Exports from FYROM to third 
countries through Salonica amounted to 471,000 tons of various 
goods. Provided governmental measures are respected by private 
and public entities alike, FYROM problems will quickly mount, 
Kalaitzoglou contends. She quotes Salonica economic circles as 
stating that "unless there are leaks, this is a golden 
opportunity to put our money where our mouth is." In addition, 
the essentially agricultural FYROM economy has been unable to 
attract foreign investments, she continues, the only possible 
exception being minerals. On the other hand, the embargo will 
affect around 25 Greek-FYROM companies created in recent years 
near the common border in the areas of textiles, ready-to-wear 
articles, food, and chemicals, Kalaitzoglou notes. Already, it 
is estimated that Greek trade, notably in Northern Greece, has 
already suffered losses of 3 billion drachmas. 
<H5>  Relations With Serbia </H5>
  According to Nikos Marakis writing in the 13 February Athens 
weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Greek-Serbian relations have 
entered a "trying" period. Citing "reliable" diplomatic sources, 
Marakis quotes Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as saying 
"Athens is no longer a trustworthy conduit for communication 
with Belgrade." Marakis lists a number of reasons for the 
falling out: 
  1. The refusal of the Greek Government to invite Milosevic 
to 
Athens following the October elections. 
  2. The absence of a reply from Prime Minister Papandreou to 
an invitation to visit Belgrade before the NATO summit. 
  3. The rejection of Serbian proposals for a Greek initiative 
within the EU framework aimed at diluting the pressure from the 
military threat. 
  4. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' low-key reaction to 
the decision of EU foreign ministers regarding NATO air strikes 
against Bosnian Serbs. 
  According to a brief article in the 16 February I 
KATHIMERINI, relations between Papandreou and Milosevic are 
"even worse" than was thought. Belgrade is very "disappointed" 
with Greek policy on the former Yugoslavia, the article reports, 
citing Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian ambassador to Athens, as 
having said that a lack of understanding exists between his 
government, the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Prime 
Minister Papandreou. The article cites diplomatic sources as 
noting that difficulties started when Papandreou, thinking that 
a visit to Belgrade on his return from Brussels was "too 
daring," ignored Milosevic's invitation.

  [Text] Ankara's pressure for the dispatch of Turkish 
forces to Bosnia is creating a new situation. The Greek 
Government is now considering the likelihood of being compelled 
to send Greek troops to join the peace forces in Bosnia. 
  According to information available at the Foreign Ministry 
and the National Defense Ministry, the United Nations will 
accept the Turkish proposal for the dispatch of Turkish troops 
as Blue Helmets [UN forces] in Bosnia. 
  Referring to this possibility, Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias said yesterday that a new situation is developing with 
pressure by Turkey, which the Greek Government has to address. 
  The Greek Government has been intensely preoccupied since 
yesterday with the new developments. Our diplomats have already 
put pressure on UN officials so that the Turkish proposal will 
not be accepted because Turkey falls within the guidelines of 
international conventions that define which states cannot 
participate in the peace forces. 
  Along with the diplomatic moves, the competent departments 
of 
the National Defense Ministry are also vigilant. A number of 
meetings have been held at the National Defense Ministry and 
officials of the [Greek] Pentagon said that Greece is prepared 
to address any eventualities. 
  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos also stressed in a 
statement the requirement that no Balkan country should 
participate in the UN peace forces in Bosnia. Mr. Venizelos 
said that Greece is following the developments with particular 
attention and makes a joint appraisal of all the facts. The 
spokesman stressed: What is of primary importance is that 
Balkan countries and countries that have historically been 
involved in the problem must not participate in the UN military 
forces in Bosnia. 
  Responding to a question on convening the party leaders' 
council under the chairmanship of the president, the government 
spokesman said that the government does not oppose the principle 
of such meetings but it does not seem that there is a specific 
reason now for a party leaders' meeting under the president. 
Besides, he added, the basic options of the government's 
foreign policy cover a broad political spectrum and move within 
the framework that was formulated at the recent meetings of the 
party leader under the president. 
  Deputy National Defense Minister Nikolaos Kouris, in a 
statement to a private radio station, said: The Greek position 
on the participation of military forces from other Balkan 
countries in the former Yugoslavia is firm. However, if there 
is a case of military involvement by other Balkan countries in 
the situation that now prevails in the Balkan region, then the 
government might find itself in need of reconsidering its 
position. This is something that we will see in the course of 
things, Mr. Kouris concluded.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 11 (A.A.) -- Iraqi Ambassador to 
Turkey Raf i'Dahham Mujjawil al-Tikriti said Friday [11 March] 
that Iraq has abided by the conditions to lift the economic 
embargo imposed by the United Nations (UN) after the Gulf war. 
  "However," he said, "the United Nations has failed to lift 
the embargo." 
  Speaking to the Anatolian News Agency al-Tikriti said the 
economic embargo including the closure of the Turkish-Iraqi 
pipeline should be lifted. 
  "Western countries again use a double standard as they are 
doing in Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. 
  Al-Tikriti said the closure of the pipeline negatively 
affected Turkey and Iraq adding, "Turkey calls for the lifting 
of the economic embargo, why does the West fail to take this 
into consideration." 
  "Iraq cannot have pre-conditions for the opening of the 
pipeline as we are not the ones who closed it," he said. 
"However we always support the continuation of bilateral talks 
with Turkey." 
  Referring to the four-way meeting between Turkey, the United 
States, Britain, and France which centered around the future of 
the multinational force, al-Tikriti said such meetings meant the 
intrusion into Iraq's internal affairs. 
  "Iraq is an independent country and Turkey is our neighbor 
and friend, but we cannot accept the United States, Britain, and 
France making decisions for the region," he said. 
  Al-Tikriti also claimed that the Kurdish problem in northern 
Iraq was created by the West. 
  The ambassador said the Iraqi administration did not impose 
a 
blockade on northern Iraq. 
  "But the UN-imposed economic embargo affects the whole 
country," he said.

  [Text] The Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] leader Abdullah 
Ocalan has proposed to the Turkish Government a cease-fire by 
both parties and the start of a dialogue to peacefully resolve 
the Kurdish issue in Turkey. According to reports, Ocalan 
declared that the PKK is prepared to accept any formula for a 
dialogue with Ankara that aims at finding a peaceful political 
solution to the Kurdish issue, provided a general amnesty is 
issued to all PKK members and there is a recognition of the 
Kurdish identity in Turkey. He called on international and 
European organizations, such as the European Parliament, the 
European Union, and the United Nations, to play a mediation role 
and supervise the dialogue for a peaceful solution to the 
Kurdish issue. It is worth noting that Turkish Government 
officials have turned down this peaceful overture.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that the 
request to use the Turkish straits as an oil route poses a great 
danger to Istanbul -- with its population of 10 million -- and 
the accident that occurred last night has once again 
demonstrated this. Cetin stated that the most appropriate route 
for the safe transportation of the oil from the Caucasus and 
Central Asia is an oil pipeline via Turkey. 
  Cetin replied to questions by TRT correspondent Ersin 
Kucukbarak. 
  [Begin recording] [Kucukbarak] Two foreign ships collided 
in the Bosporus last night and the population of Istanbul was 
again faced with great danger. Given the fact that there are 
requests to use the Istanbul strait as an oil route, how do you 
evaluate last night's incident? 
  [Cetin] Istanbul, which has a population of 10 million, was 
really faced with great danger as a result of the collision of 
two ships last night. This shows that the passage of flammable 
and explosive substances, such as oil, from the Bosporus will 
create problems, especially from a safety viewpoint. For the 
past few years, we have been trying to explain to both our 
neighboring countries and to transporters using the route the 
safety problems entailed in this. Last night's incident 
demonstrated once again how justified we are in our sensitivity 
to the matter. 
  Turkey believes that the passage from the straits should be 
regulated by certain rules. To this end, a statute was drawn up 
with the contribution of my ministry. This statue is due to 
come into effect on 1 July 1994. The arrangements stipulated in 
the statute comply with the Montreux Treaty. When the statue is 
implemented, such accidents will be reduced to a minimum, but I 
do not believe that this will constitute a total solution. The 
Istanbul strait is one the most dangerous sea routes in the 
world. At certain points, this strait becomes as narrow as 700 
meters. Given the tonnage of today's ships, even their ordinary 
passage becomes highly dangerous. Transit traffic through the 
straits has become increasingly intense in recent years. More 
than 50,000 ships pass through Istanbul every year. 
  Turkey cannot remain indifferent to such an important issue. 
This is unthinkable. The Bosporus is extremely important 
because of the people around it. The Istanbul strait cannot be 
utilized for long to serve such a purpose from the 
environmental, security, and technical viewpoints. In the 
future, dry cargo traffic will increase and the development of 
Ukraine and the Russian Federation will contribute to this 
increase. Therefore, we propose the following as an ultimate 
solution: The Istanbul strait should not used for the 
transportation of flammable and explosive materials such as oil. 
If at all, it should be used at a minimum. 
  Therefore, for some time now, we have been explaining these 
problems, introducing new arrangements, and speaking to 
neighboring countries. We are seeking a definitive and lasting 
solution with a view to preventing the increasing traffic in the 
future. This solution consists of transporting crude oil to the 
Mediterranean via pipelines to pass through Turkey. Last 
night's incident has unfortunately once again demonstrated how 
justified we are on this matter. It seems that the world wishes 
to ignore such dangers as long as it does not witness or 
experience them. For a long time, we have been trying to 
explain that the Istanbul strait cannot be used to this end. 
Therefore, as an ultimate solution, the Bosporus should not be 
used to transport dangerous substances like oil and the oil 
should be transported to the Mediterranean via pipelines through 
Turkey. 
  [Kucukbarak] Would this entail a change in the Montreux 
Treaty? 
  [Cetin] Actually, there is no need to make an amendment to 
the Montreux Treaty for the oil pipeline. A change is also not 
necessary for the new statue. In other words, even if Turkey 
does not rediscuss the Montreux Treaty, it cannot allow this. 
It cannot endanger a city with 10 million people. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has stated that 
Nevruz will be celebrated freely throughout the country on 21 
March but that nobody will be allowed to use it as a tool for 
provocation. 
  Answering reporters' questions in Ankara, Mentese said that 
Nevruz celebrations have been held for years and that the state 
will take the necessary measures to prevent it from being used 
as a tool for other goals. 
  Asked to comment on the latest resolution passed by the 
European Parliament in connection with Turkey, Mentese pointed 
out that there is no discrimination between Turks and Kurds in 
Turkey. He said that such unfounded allegations are made by 
circles that want to divide Turkey. Our Kurdish brothers in 
Turkey are not a minority, he said, adding: It seems that the 
European Parliament does not know Turkey. They must come and 
see for themselves how the Kurds benefit from all rights. 
  The interior minister also said that the necessary measures 
are being taken to ensure that the local elections are held in 
security.

  [Text] Prosperity Party [RP] General Chairman Necmettin 
Erbakan, in Adil Ekonomik Duzen [Just Economic 
Order], the book he wrote in 1991, proposed "miraculous 
prescriptions" in explaining the economic system they would use 
if they assumed power. He included solutions peculiar to 
socialist economies in the system, in which everyone would have 
retirement insurance without making payments, interest is 
described as oppression, and prepaid vouchers and low prices are 
promised. The book contains radical changes in everything from 
taxation to unemployment prevention without mentioning where the 
resources would come from to do it. 
  Some of Erbakan's economic prescriptions follow: 
  --How the slavery system exploits us: Our 
diagnostic brochure explains clearly that the slavery system 
exploits us through the five germs of interest and capitalism. 
These germs are: the interest germ, the unfair taxation germ, 
the mint germ, the exchange rate germ, and the credit system 
germ. 
  --Basic principles of the Just Economic Order: As 
known, a mathematical system is expressed in basic terms that 
describe the system. For example, Euclidean geometry is based 
on three fundamental axioms, whereas Lobachevski geometry is 
based on three different axioms. Numerals, of course, are based 
on four axioms. 
  Likewise, there are basic principles that allow a game of 
checkers to be played, just as there are basic principles 
exclusive to chess that allow that game to be played. 
  (These two kinds of geometry are different from each other 
from the standpoint of the postulates -- accepted basic truths 
-- that comprise their foundations. This is especially clear in 
the "parallel postulate": Euclid--In the ancient 
Greek geometry of 4 BC, only one parallel may be drawn to a 
straight line from a point outside it. 
Lobachevski--In the geometry of the 18th [as 
published] century Russian Academy of Science, it is possible to 
draw an infinite number of parallels to a straight line from a 
point outside it.) 
  --Regulatory services: In the Just Economic Order, 
the state also provides regulatory services for basic economic 
goods. In the Just Economic Order, for example, a Wheat 
Foundation would take the place of today's Soil Products Office. 
This organization is renamed as a foundation because it 
renounces any goal of profit and becomes an organization solely 
for the service of the citizen. This foundation would be 
organized at the city level throughout the entire country. 
Anyone who had wheat and wished to sell it would give the wheat 
to this foundation and receive payment at that day's price. Or 
anyone wishing to buy wheat would pay at the current price and 
receive as much wheat as he wanted. 
  --"No interest" principle: There would be no 
interest in the Just Order. For interest is unfair and 
oppressive. The man who accepts interest is like the man who 
drinks the tears and consumes the flesh and blood of the poor 
and needy. One who drinks blood is a vampire. The reasoning 
offered in order to suppress these facts and, knowingly or 
unknowingly, defend the capitalistic interest system is: 
  "Money is a special commodity, because a great deal of 
expense is gone to and effort expended to preserve its stability 
and value. Property is rented, so why shouldn't money be rented 
also? Interest is something like rental and, therefore, is 
right, as capital is an element of production." 
  --Principle of money as equivalent of land, plant, 
standard commodity, gold and foreign exchange: It is 
possible to divide goods which may be bought and sold into four 
groups in the Just Order. They are land, plant, standard 
commodities, and gold and foreign exchange, or precious minerals 
and values, which have been offered for sale. Whatever the 
amount at which these are offered for sale, money exists in that 
amount to purchase them. Money cannot be poured into the 
marketplace in exchange for anything else than these goods which 
may be bought and sold. 
  --Work on credit: Suppose a sewing machine 
operator makes 5 million Turkish liras a month under the Just 
Order. I would hire these people and put them to work. The bank, 
or the state, would pay their salaries and I would be the 
borrower as the entrepreneur, the owner of the factory. I would 
then sell the clothing I produced and pay my debt. 
  --Hold credit: I have some wheat. Prices are cheap 
right now, and I'm thinking prices will be higher in 3 months, 
so I deliver my wheat to the wheat foundation on condition [of 
future sale]. I receive, for example, 80 percent of the present 
price as credit on the wheat being held. When prices increase 3 
months later, I say that I'll sell my wheat at today's prices, I 
get the rest of the price at that time and I'm paying off the 
hold credit I received. 
  --Paid tax-equivalent credit: If someone has 
occasion to receive income from the state, he may receive credit 
in accordance with specific criteria and under specific 
conditions from the state, depending on the income in question. 
The name of this credit is "paid tax-equivalent credit." 
  --What is taxation?: All taxes, funds, and 
deductions that have been imposed under various names are 
totally unfair and all of them must be abolished. 
  --Social security: A person receives the 
compensation that is right for the amount of time he works. When 
he is unemployed, he receives unemployment compensation. When he 
wishes to retire, he receives retirement compensation. Suppose a 
worker receives 5 million liras a month while employed, 4 
million liras when unemployed, and 3 million liras when he 
retires. There is no need for this person to wait until a 
specific age to retire and receive a retirement pension. If he 
wishes, he may retire and opt for the retirement pension. If he 
desires to work again later, he may return to active working 
life.

<F P=106> [Article by Jale Ozgenturk and Ridvan Akar: "Two Most </F>
Painful Prescriptions"] 
  [Text] The Turkish economy has failed to get off to any 
kind of a good start for 1994. The public deficits, foreign 
deficits, and inflation that have been accumulating for years 
ended up surfacing in a foreign exchange crisis...and 
devaluation of the Turkish lira, resignation of the Central Bank 
president, and the rapid rise of bank interest. Is the crisis 
temporary? What will the effects of it be, and what measures 
should be taken because of the crisis? 
  We asked for answers to these questions from Prof Dr Salih 
Neftci, who drew up a draft stabilization package for TUSIAD 
[Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association] two years 
ago, and former DPT [State Planning Organization] Under 
Secretary Yildirim Akturk, who was on the team that applied the 
24 January measures. Both offered prescriptions that differed 
from others by their "radical" approaches. 
  Neftci said that, first of all, it would be impossible for 
the economy's own balances to pull it out of the current 
impasse. He stressed that a stabilization package is definitely 
required and that timing of the package is more important than 
content. 
  Prof Dr Salih Neftci's views follow: 
  --It is too early as yet for a stabilization package. For 
Turkey to accept a painful prescription it will be necessary for 
the crisis to deepen and for inflation to reach three digits. 
The crisis will deepen within one and a half to two years. Any 
stabilization package whose implementation would be attempted up 
until this time would inevitably fail. 
  --Stabilization packages are a price that all segments of 
society have to pay. Today everybody is saying, "Okay, a 
stabilization package is absolutely necessary." Everyone throws 
the ball into someone else's court when it comes to shouldering 
the cost. Which means that no one wants to make the sacrifice 
yet for a stabilization package. 
  --All of the stabilization packages on the agenda at the 
moment are similar. However, it is necessary that this 
stabilization package concept not be allowed to degenerate. 
Stabilization packages have to be radical in content. When the 
crisis hits bottom there may be a question of 300,000 public 
employees being left jobless, provided they are given 
compensation. There may be a midnight decision to shut down a 
bunch of KIT's [State Economic Enterprises]. All segments of 
society must be prepared for this kind of decision. 
  --An important feature of stabilization packages is that 
society must have confidence in the people who head up this 
matter. Bearing in mind that the decisions they make will not 
take effect in the short term, all must recognize that the 
prescription cannot go forward without confidence in those who 
will be implementing it. 
  --Attention must be paid to another very important point in 
moving so rapidly towards the stabilization-package stage. It is 
necessary to prevent the great losses that the government could 
cause, in foreign loans in particular. If Turkey could not honor 
its foreign exchange obligations, a credibility crisis would 
occur in which no stabilization package could alleviate the 
burden of this economy. 
  Akturk's "painful prescription," meanwhile, contains the 
following measures: 
  --Turkey has reached the point of an impasse under the 
influence of mistaken policies that have been pursued since 
1988. Military spending went up. Black holes were created. You 
get lost if you get into a black hole. Yet the governments were 
positive in order to appear fashionable. 
  --This tableau created an ever-worsening illness. The tumor 
grew rapidly. The scalpel is the only remedy. It cannot be done 
without the knife. It cannot be done with drugs. We have to cut 
the tumor out to eradicate it. 
  --The state, employers, workers, farmers, and business must 
sit down together now and work out a compromise. 
  --Goals must be discussed, starting with inflation. 
Agreement 
must be reached on reducing inflation step by step to 45 percent 
the first year, 35 percent the second year, 20 percent the third 
year. 
  --The state must set a goal of 50 percent interest on 
borrowing. Price increases in commodities must be at this rate 
also. The need for government borrowing must be reduced. Price 
increases are the way to do this. The rate must be reduced from 
20 percent to 12 percent. 
  --As regards taxes, a system like advance taxation is 
necessary. Tax collection should be turned over to the private 
sector to increase tax revenues. Bonded financial consultants 
are capable of doing this. 
  --The most important element is wage-related. Wages and 
productivity must be linked. The message must be given that 
wages will decline in businesses that suffer losses. Urgent 
reduction of cadres is necessary. Only required employees must 
remain. 
  --Some of the KIT's must be closed. Severance pay for 
personnel working at the KIT's up for sale, such as Sumer Bank, 
should be converted to shares, and employees should become 
partners in these businesses. 
  --Politicians cannot achieve this alone. The police regime 
must be given up. It is necessary for everyone to sacrifice. A 
solid determination is necessary. This can be resolved only by 
an above-party compromise. It does not seem possible for this 
government to take stabilization measures, at least until the 
local elections. 
  --The country will be saved if after the elections we get an 
extraordinary government able to assume political responsibility 
and if a workable cadre is formed that will last for a year. 
Otherwise, inflation will reach three digits within a year, and 
Turkey will have serious payment difficulties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7: Nuclear Safety, Key to Russian </F>
Membership"] 
  [Text] Florence, 13 Mar (ANSA) -- The safety of nuclear 
power stations in Central and East Europe may prove a key for 
allowing Russia to join the elite club of the world's most 
industrial nations after the Group of Seven summit in Naples 
this July, according to Italian Minister for the Environment 
Valdo Spini. Specifying that he was speaking on a personal 
basis, Spini, who chaired a summit of G-7 environment ministers 
here this weekend, said an enlargement of the group to eight 
nations would be "positive" for environmental issues. 
  Spini said the summit decided to add nuclear safety in East 
and Central Europe to the six-point agenda on environmental 
issues already sketched in for Naples. "We wanted to underscore 
a sense of alarm, without going into detail about possible 
interventions," explained Spini. 
  One consideration was that the region in question has scarce 
primary sources of energy whence an option for nuclear power is 
more probable. 
  The latest figures indicate that, even Russia, which is a 
major oil and natural gas producer, already has 27 working 
reactors for an installed power of 5,800 megawatt and plans to 
increase nuclear power's contribution to its total energy needs 
from 14 to 34 percent by 2000, bringing three new reactors on 
stream by 1995 and developing a further eight for 2005. 
  Spini told reporters that a major demand from the summit 
here 
is that the G-7 nations should supply greater technical and 
financial assistance to the Central and East European nations in 
this field. 
  He added that a major obstacle for making Russia the eighth 
nation in a Group of Eight was its economic problems, but he 
said that direct Russian involvement in the debate on the 
environment planned at the end of the Naples summit could be a 
first step to the group's enlargement.

  [Text] The taoiseach [prime minister] has said there must 
be a cessation of violence before there can be any direct talks 
with Sinn Fein. Mr. Reynolds was speaking in New York about the 
IRA statement which calls for a reopening of direct links with 
the British Government. From New York, our political editor 
Donal Kelly: 
  [Kelly] Mr. Reynolds played down the significance of the IRA 
statement, saying he saw nothing new in it. He made clear there 
could be no talks between two parties about the peace process to 
the exclusion of all others. And anyway, he said, it was only 
by a cessation of violence that talks could take place with 
everybody around the table. If violence ended then the forum 
for peace and reconciliation could get underway, as well as the 
preliminary talks between Sinn Fein and the British Government, 
leading to full all-party negotiations. 
  Asked if he thought the IRA was indicating the declaration 
did not go far enough, the taoiseach said that if they didn't 
like it there was nothing to stop them ending violence and 
getting around the negotiating table. However, he said, he was 
still cautiously optimistic about the prospects for the 
declaration. It would form the basis for future talks, he said, 
with or without Sinn Fein.

<F P=106> [Gerd Brueggemann report: "Jobs Will Be the Only Topic"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Detroit -- A big conference of ministers of the 
seven leading industrial nations (G-7) that starts in Detroit 
today will be dealing exclusively with problems of employment. 
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who suggested the conference last 
year, considers the meeting a first step "toward starting a 
dialogue with our international partners that will open up ways 
for sound economic conditions" for the 21st century. 
  The German delegation will include Ministers Waigel, Bluem, 
and Rexrodt. As the current unemployment problem is mainly a 
structural one, Bonn thinks that "the exchange of ideas on 
flexibility and deregulation, training, the importance of labor 
costs, as well as opportunities of labor policy" ought to be the 
central issues of the talks. 
  Bonn wants to refer to the plans laid down in the 
government's paper on Germany as a business location, which have 
been partially put into practice already, on how to do away with 
obstacles to employment by rigid labor market strategies. In 
addition, the German ministers want to ask the other countries 
at the Detroit conference to enforce the results of the GATT 
free trade talks consistently. In the long run, protectionism 
does not secure any jobs but endangers them, the German 
conference paper says. 
  With these positions, Bonn seems to be wanting to counteract 
U.S. intentions to make the Bundesbank's interest rate policy a 
central issue in Detroit. In the days prior to the conference, 
U.S. politicians repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. economy is 
on a course of sound economic growth, which has already led to a 
reduction in unemployment from almost 8 to 6.5 percent. Now it 
is time for the European and Japanese economies to be boosted. 
  In particular, U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence 
Summers has voiced such demands prior to the "Job Summit." 
Lower German interest rates would be an important contribution 
to strengthening demand in Europe, he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Margaretha </F>
Kopeinig in Brussels; date not given: "Klaus Kinkel Is 
Optimistic: EU Compromise in Sight"] 
  [Text] Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel is 
optimistic that the membership negotiations in Brussels can be 
formally concluded during Wednesday night [16 March]. Provided 
the referendum is positive, this would give the go-ahead for 
Austria to join the European Union [EU] as of 1 January 1995. 
  Kinkel was essentially involved in the success of the EU 
negotiations. Every time the talks were stalling, he provided a 
new impetus with proposals for a compromise. 
  [Kopeinig] Minister, will there be a breakthrough for Norway 
during the forthcoming EU negotiations -- and thus a solution to 
the institutional issue? 
  [Kinkel] I will do everything for the negotiations to be 
concluded successfully for Norway, too. I am still optimistic. 
It must not and cannot be that the expansion fails because of a 
few thousand tonnes of fish or because of the institutional 
question, important though this is. 
  [Kopeinig] Have you received any signals that Great Britain 
and Spain are willing to give in regarding the raising of the 
blocking minority? 
  [Kinkel] I am in permanent contact with my colleagues Hurd 
and Solana. Both countries want expansion, but the British 
Government is under domestic pressure. It is quite clear that 
the blocking minority must be raised from 23 to 27 votes. The 
European Parliament will not agree to the membership treaties as 
long as the blocking minority has not been raised. 
  [Kopeinig] London continues to insist on 23 votes. Where do 
you see a compromise in this respect? 
  [Kinkel] A solution could emerge by coming to a temporary 
settlement with 27 votes until the government conference in 1996 
and by making a final decision only in 1996. 
  [Kopeinig] What do you expect of Austria as a future EU 
member? 
  [Kinkel] Austria is highly welcome in the EU. As a state in 
the center of Europe, it will contribute its political vitality, 
its economic capacity, and its culture to the EU and it will 
constructively participate in shaping this Europe, which is 
subjected to great changes as a result of the disappearance of 
the East-West conflict. Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway 
belong in this EU. In the future all members must master the 
common tasks with a readiness for compromise and in the European 
spirit.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrice-Henry Desaubliaux: "Paris Criticizes </F>
UNPROFOR"] 
  [Text] France will increase its contingent of 6,042 men by 
an additional 800 men, in theory for a period limited to three 
months. These reinforcements, drawn mainly from the 9th Marine 
Infantry Division (2d RIMa [marine regiment], RICM [expansion 
not given], 6th Engineers Regiment), will form a third French 
battalion in Sarajevo. 
  For a long time Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has opposed 
these reinforcements. He only recently consented to the 
dispatch of the addtional troops after three vital preconditions 
were met: The arrival on the spot of other UN contingents; the 
return to France by 15 June of the battalion deployed in 
Krajina; and better protection for the French blue helmets. 
  Originally, the prime minister's surprise visit on Sunday 
[13 
March] was intended to provide support and encouragement to the 
French battalion stationed in Bihac, one of whose soldiers was 
killed on Friday by a Serb or Bosnian marksman. Indeed it 
primarily enabled Edouard Balladur to convey a message: Paris 
expects the United Nations to show a more vigorous reaction when 
French blue helmets suffer a deliberate attack, as was the case 
on Saturday evening. 
  "The Serbs began to attack French elements at 1830. The 
decision to respond by air fire was not made until 2335. Much 
too late, especially because it was night." Colonel Chanier, 
deputy chief of the SIRPA [Armed Forces Information and Public 
Relations Service], said yesterday that the reaction time should 
be reduced to less than one hour. Once you go beyond that, 
efficacy is no longer guaranteed and the response tends to 
become a reprisal action, which the UN resolutions would not 
authorize. 
  How is it possible to move more quickly? On Saturday, the 
procedure was as follows: The blue helmets attacked in the city 
of Bihac reported the incident to their command posts which 
requested air intervention at 1900, reporting the matter to the 
military chief of the Bihac pocket, who alerted General Rose. 
At 2030, the chief of the blue helmets in Bosnia reported the 
matter to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] Chief General Cot. 
There were then requests for explanations by the forces on the 
spot. At 2150 General Cot telephoned Mr. Akashi, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's personal representative, and then sent him the 
official request for an air intervention at 2240. The matter 
was then referred to New York, before coming back to Zagreb, 
where permission to intervene was given by Mr. Akashi at 2335. 
  During a private conversation, the prime minister informed 
Mr. Akashi that it was "imperative" to rapidly review this 
procedure. Gen. Joel Marchand, coordinator of French resources 
in the former Yugoslavia, was instructed to ask UNPROFOR to 
establish a rapid and effective decisionmaking process. 
  At the same time, Mr. Merimee, the French ambassador to the 
United Nations, is to request that the delegation of powers, 
currently entrusted to the UN secretary general's 
representative, be given to members of the military. Or, at the 
very least, that it be in the hands of authorities who are 
permanently reachable. 
  These provisions are of a technical nature. They will be 
adopted if there is a real political will within the United 
Nations. Hence the political pressure which Edouard Balladur's 
visit to Bihac represented.

  [Text] Madrid, March 14, IRNA -- Iran's deputy foreign 
minister for Euro-American affairs, Mahmud Va'ezi, arrived here 
for a three-day official visit here Monday [14 March] and was 
received by the director general of the Spanish Foreign Ministry 
for the Middle East and Northern African Affairs Moratinod [name 
as received]. 
  Va'ezi said his trip is intended to promote Iran-Spain 
relations in economic and cultural areas as well as on the 
international scene. He said his talks with Spanish officials 
would encompass topics as wide as those of Russia, Central Asia, 
Karabakh, Tajikistan, Iraq, the Persian Gulf, the European Union 
and current developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Commenting on an Iranian loan outstanding to Spain, Va'ezi 
said the loan is not reallly substantial and commented that in 
just the same way as agreements had been reached with Germany on 
outstanding loans, so too, a similar agreement would be arrived 
at with Spain. He said Spain is a major buyer of Iranian oil, 
and that in addition there is very good prospects for export of 
Iran's non-oil products to that country. He said the two 
countries can also exchange students and artists and also 
establish departments of Persian and Spanish at their respective 
universities. 
  The Iranian official said since Spain is due to become 
chairman of the EU [European Union] next year, he would also 
discuss cooperation with Spanish officials in this field.

<F P=106> [Article by Iver Hoj: "Serbs Will Decide If We Are at War"] </F>
  [Text] Military theorists agree that NATO's first act of 
war in 45 years intensifies the conflict in Bosnia. But there is 
profound disagreement on whether the attack was necessary. 
  After U.S. NATO planes shot down four Bosnian Serb planes, 
it 
is the Serbs who will decide if Denmark becomes a belligerent 
power for the first time since 1864. 
  That is the view of retired Lieutenant Colonel Regner R. 
Moller, a jurist who was administrative chief of the Defense 
Research Service and a member of the Defense Research and 
Analysis Group until October 1993, following the first NATO 
attack in the alliance's 45-year history. "Denmark, as a NATO 
country, is not automatically at war with the Bosnian Serbs. But 
this was not a defense against an attacking 
adversary. This was an air attack -- whether or not there are UN 
resolutions. If the Serbs regard this as an act of aggression on 
the part of NATO or the United Nations and think they are at war 
with the aggressors, then Denmark will also be at war," he said. 
  Unlike another military theorist, Lieutenant Colonel Michael 
Clemmesen of the Defense Academy, who considers the action 
logical and justified, Moller is worried that Denmark might be 
heading into a war because -- in his opinion -- U.S. F-16 planes 
overreacted in the air space over Bosnia. He sees many 
unclarified political pitfalls in the development. Among other 
things, the question of who gave the order to shoot the planes 
down is decisive: 
  "Was it a NATO general or the UN system? If it was the 
United 
Nations, the world stands together. If it was NATO -- and the 
Serbs can seek support from Russia -- Denmark and NATO could be 
on their way into a conflict that could have incalculable 
political consequences." 
  Moller -- who is a member of the Farum municipal council for 
the Liberal Party -- belongs to the wing of military theorists 
who want a low NATO profile in Bosnia-Herzegovina. And he is 
very concerned that the clearly superior F-16 planes shot down 
four outdated Serb planes. 
  "That should not be necessary. It is the NATO hawks who have 
the upper hand. I fear this could Vietnamize the conflict in the 
Balkans," he said. 
<H5>  Important Hours </H5>
  Lt. Col. Clemmesen has a firm and entirely different 
assessment of the events: 
  "The Serbs must have perceived that the recent signals from 
Russia meant they could do anything -- as long as they did not 
touch Sarajevo. It looks like a quite deliberate move on the 
part of the Serbs. 
  ``When six planes take off simultaneously and fly in 
formation, it is a crystal-clear violation of the flight ban. 
NATO regarded the action as a gross violation of the UN 
resolution. Quite rightly.'' 
<H5>  Serb Provocation </H5>
  Clemmesen refused to call the shooting down of the planes a 
move on NATO's part. 
  "It was a programmed action, entirely prepared for. The 
possibility that they would react if this kind of thing happened 
has been in the air. We are sending a signal to the Serbs that 
we will ensure that the UN role is fulfilled. But this is a 
striking change in the normal picture in Bosnia. It is a 
deliberate Serb provocation and the next 24 to 48 hours will be 
very important. If the Serbs -- as seems likely -- choose to 
deny that the planes were shot down, it will be a good thing. If 
so, they apparently accept the fact that they must try to avoid 
losing face to an even greater extent."

  [Text] Despite obstacles, it appears that a dialogue 
between Greece and Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] with Cyrus Vance's mediation will begin and is 
expected to continue immediately after the two sides reply to 
the proposals presented by the international mediator in Geneva. 
Very little is known about the contents of Vance's set of 
ideas. However, there are reports that the proposed draft 
agreement has basic similarities with the one presented in May 
1993 by Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen although it has some basic 
differences. 
  According to information from diplomatic sources, the most 
significant difference is the separation of the 
confidence-building measures from the issue of the name. 
According to the same sources, in order to continue the current 
efforts, the international mediator has not made the lifting of 
Greek countermeasures a condition, as Skopje insists. Greek 
diplomatic moves are distinguished by a first phase that 
includes the formation of the preliminary conditions for the 
resumption of the dialogue and a second phase that includes 
dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations and economic 
cooperation measures between the two countries. Parallel 
meetings of experts from the two countries with Vance are 
expected in the next couple of days to discuss his proposals. 
Separate meetings between the UN mediator and the foreign 
ministers of the two countries are expected to follow.

<F P=106> [Report by Selin Caglayan: "Argument With the United States </F>
at the Summit"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Yesterday's summit on northern Iraq in 
Ankara, which included the United States, France, Britain, and 
Turkey, failed to create any hope of removing Turkey's anxiety 
over the embargo on Baghdad. Assistant Secretary of State 
Steven Oxman's inflexibility over maintaining the embargo on 
Iraq created an argument in the bilateral talks held with the 
Turkish side. Oxman remained irreconcilable on withdrawing oil 
from the Karkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline, saying that that would 
breach the embargo. Oxman was informed that Ozdem Sanberk, 
under secretary of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will 
visit Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi officials on the issue. 
  The Turkish side informed the U.S., French, and British 
officials of the existing problems and suggested that the world 
should move to normalize its relations with the Baghdad 
administration with a view to solving these problems. Sadi 
Calislar, Turkey's charge d'affaires in Baghdad, explained his 
observations in Iraq and stressed that the view that the embargo 
would remove Saddam Husayn from power is wrong. But Oxman 
clearly said that the adopting of a moderate approach toward 
Saddam Husayn by Washington was out of the question. The 
Turkish side responded by explaining that the problems relating 
to the Hammer Force, northern Iraq, and the embargo cannot be 
solved if the current approach to the Saddam administration is 
not relaxed. Turkish officials also explained that Ankara 
upholds that view, not because it supports Saddam Husayn, but 
because the embargo and the confusion it has created have 
seriously affected Turkey's economy and security. 
  The Turkish side listed its views in the summit as follows: 
  1. The confusion in northern Iraq must be removed quickly. 
The Hammer Force cannot remain in the region indefinitely. New 
clashes may occur as a result of the confusion. That could 
affect the entire region. 
  2. Turkey cannot allow the establishment of an independent 
Kurdish state in northern Iraq. The West is inclined to favor 
the establishment of a Kurdish state, something that has caused 
anxiety in Turkey. Extending the flight region of the Hammer 
Force aircraft to the southern sector of the 36th parallel in 
Iraq is out of the question. Make no decision to encourage the 
Kurds on that issue. Instead, encourage them to establish a 
dialogue with the Baghdad administration. Ankara is convinced 
that the effort to be made in that direction will yield a result. 
  3. The problem must be solved by the peoples in Iraq through 
democratic methods and on the basis that Iraq's territorial 
integrity is maintained and Baghdad is recognized as the central 
authority. 
  4. The embargo on Iraq still creates problems for Turkey. 
It must be lifted. It has been established that the embargo 
cannot be a solution. The Baghdad administration must be 
encouraged to fully comply with the UN Security Council 
resolutions.

  [Excerpts] Brussels--Speaking during the international 
conference on the Kurdish problem in Brussels, Kani Yilmaz, 
Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] representative in Europe, 
criticized the West's approach to the Kurdish problem in a 
threatening tone. Yilmaz attacked European countries' stance on 
the problem in southeast Turkey and accused them of maintaining 
double standards "particularly on issues relating to human 
rights." He said: "The approach maintained by several 
countries against the PKK, including their move to ban the PKK 
after ridiculously accusing it of being a `terrorist 
organization' indicates that they support the tyrannical country 
that maintains an unjust approach and that is responsible for 
bloodshed. We know of the sources that provide arms and 
economic support to Turkey in the unjust war against the Kurds. 
That is unacceptable. I want to stress that the effort to solve 
the problem in the absence of our party [not further specified] 
will be an interference in our people's will. That will not be 
allowed. We won't remain inactive in the direction of the 
governments and international organizations that maintain that 
approach while claiming that they want to take initiatives or 
steps toward solving the Kurdish problem. Several friendly 
countries know our position in that regard." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Ocalan Sends Message to the Conference </H5>
  PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan conveyed a message to the 
conference in Brussels. It listed his views as follows: 
  1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution. We 
will also remain open to initiatives by foreign countries and 
organizations to solve the problem. 
  2. I want to point out that we do not want to divide Turkey 
and that the propaganda against us conflicts with our approach. 
  3. I want to point out that we will agree to be a side to 
any democratic dialogue that the Turkish Government may want to 
establish, a dialogue in which we can outline the legitimate 
demands of our people and achieve a result. We have neither 
rejected nor opposed any concrete proposal for a solution since 
the problem began. Within that framework, we are prepared to 
discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a 
federation. 
  4. We won't try to avoid and we won't try to impose our 
views if an initiative is taken for a cease-fire agreement and 
talks to solve the problem under international supervision. 
  5. Most importantly, I want to stress that we guarantee we 
will agree to the decisions the conference may adopt for a 
solution. I also want to stress that we will end the armed 
struggle if the ground is prepared for a political solution and 
free political activity.

  [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union and 
[EU] Norway reached agreement here early Wednesday [16 March] on 
Norwegian membership of the EU, the Greek presidency of the EU 
said. 
  Diplomats said Norway had joined Austria, Finland and Sweden 
in qualifying to join the 12-nation union on January 1 next year. 
  One diplomat said: "It's a considerable breakthrough. Most 
people here didn't believe Norway would do it on time." 
  The breakthrough came after Norway and the EU agreed to 
Spanish demands for extra fishing catch quotas as part of 
Norway's entry ticket to the Union. 
  Under a complicated formula, the EU's four poorest countries 
have been given the right to an extra 14,100 tonnes of annual 
cod catch quotas in the Barents Sea starting in 1998. 
  About 6,000 tonnes will be offered by Norway, calculated 
partly on a predicted increase in fish stocks by 1998, and the 
EU is to buy the right to catch another 8,000 tonnes, mainly in 
the Russian waters of the Barents Sea. 
  EU officials said 45 percent of the extra quotas would go to 
Spain, 45 percent to Portugal, five percent to Ireland and five 
percent to Greece. 
  Austria, Finland and Sweden agreed to their terms for 
joining 
the EU on March 1, but Oslo originally refused Spain's demand 
for access to Norway's fish-rich waters. 
  But EU membership for Norway and the other applicants is 
still dependent on ratification by popular referendums in each 
of the four countries and by the European Parliament. 
  It also depends on resolution of an internal EU quarrel over 
changes in the voting rules of ministerial councils to take 
account of the newcomers. 
  Britain, with some backing from Spain, continued Tuesday to 
oppose any change in the balance of power which would result 
from the entry of four new members. 
  EU foreign ministers will meet here again next Tuesday to 
continue their attempts to overcome the British objection.

  [Text] The Norwegian Government is satisfied with the 
achieved negotiations' result with the European Union [EU]. Our 
reporter in Oslo, Ulla-Maria Johansen reports: 
  Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen and Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland are satisfied with the negotiations' result, 
which the fisheries minister regards as better in many respects 
than the negotiations' result of 1972. According to Prime 
Minister Brundtland, Norway has achieved a good agreement and 
she recommends that Norway should now grasp the historic 
opportunity and take part with its Nordic neighbors in the 
political cooperation on our continent. 
  Anne Enger Lahnstein, chairman of the Center Party opposing 
EU membership, is of a different view. One of the central 
issues of the agreement is the Norwegian model of control over 
the fish stocks, which is due to be transferred to the EU after 
the transitional period as part of the EU's fishing policy. 
Lahnstein thinks that the agreement is bad and it will turn the 
sea region north of the 62d latitude into an EU sea. Norway 
will not receive guarantees that after the transitional period 
it will control the fish stocks in the Barents Sea. 
  The leader of the citizens' movement against the EU, 
Christen 
Nygaard, thinks that Norway surrendered during the talks. He 
regards the fishing agreement as serious for the whole coast. 
  The leader of the European Movement favoring EU membership, 
Inge Loenning, thinks for his part that the negotiated fishing 
agreement is so good that he believes it will guarantee a 
majority in favor of membership in the referendum.

  [Excerpts] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- Norwegian Prime 
Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland urged her countrymen and women 
early Wednesday [16 March] to seize a "historic opportunity" to 
join the European Union [EU]. 
  She was speaking in Oslo immediately after Norwegian and EU 
ministers had agreed here on the terms for Norway to join the 
Union along with Austria, Finland and Sweden on January 1 next 
year. 
  Brundtland announced an immediate start of campaigning to 
persuade Norwegian voters to ratify EU membership in a 
referendum later in the year. 
  Similar referendums are also planned in the other three 
applicant countries, which reached agreement on EU membership 
two weeks earlier on March 1. 
  Opposition to EU membership is strongest in Norway. 
Norwegians have already rejected membership of what was then 
the European Economic Community once before, in 1972, when a 
referendum rejected a treaty of accession that saw Britain, 
Denmark and Ireland join the Community. 
  According to latest polls, opponents still number 44 percent 
of the population against 28 percent in favour. But the gap is 
narrowing. 
  In a speech which was distributed here, Brundtland said 
Norway had achieved all its objectives in the negotiations, 
including special financial support for its cold climate 
agriculture. 
  But diplomats conceded that the Norwegian Government would 
have to persuade their electorate that they had lived up to 
their pledge not to grant "a single extra fish" to foreign 
fishing boats seeking to exploit Norwegian waters. 
  "I don't know how the agreement will be received on the 
coasts of Norway," Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen 
admitted here at a press conference. 
  Oslo's accord with the EU had been held up for two weeks 
because of a dispute with Spain over Spanish demands for access 
to the fish-rich waters if Norway joined the Union. 
  Ultimately, Norway conceded about 6,000 tonnes of cod catch 
quotas a year -- mainly to Spain and Portugal. [passage omitted] 
  Oslo was pressed into agreeing not to export whale products, 
so that whale hunting will be limited to a handful of families 
which traditionally have made their living from it. 
  Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said membership 
of the EU was important for security. "Norway is still located 
at a strategically important crossroads. By joining the EU and 
participating in its common foreign and security policies, we 
will ensure that relations between Norway and Russia become part 
of Russia's relations with an integrated Europe, not merely 
relations between a major power and a small neighbouring 
country," Godal said.

  [Excerpt] Brussels, March 15 (AFP) -- Foreign ministers of 
the European Union [EU] resumed their quarrel here Tuesday [15 
March] over a balance of power deadlock which is holding up the 
entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU. 
  "We have to get a deal because otherwise the whole process 
of 
EU enlargement is threatened," Luxembourg Foreign Minister 
Jacques Poos said ahead of the third effort in less than three 
weeks to break the impasse. 
  The enlargement process was being held up by the demand of 
Britain and Spain that the entry of more small countries into 
the Union should not dilute the ability of London and Madrid to 
block decisions they do not like. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was not 
optimistic. "There is nothing on the table at the moment that 
satisfies the general concerns of the people of Britain," he 
said. 
  The ministers were also debating a dispute between Spain and 
Norway over fishing catch quotas which threatens to stop Norway 
from entering the Union on January 1 next year. 
  Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of 
membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations 
with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to 
Norway's fish-rich waters. 
  Diplomats expect that the fishing issue will be resolved 
more 
easily than the voting rights dispute, and that Norway and 
Spain's EU partners might buy off the Spanish opposition to 
Norwegian membership with more fish. 
  But Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said there were 
no 
new proposals to break the balance of power deadlock, which 
hinges on the effect of enlargement on the EU's 
delicately-balanced system of majority voting. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 15 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
is heading for crisis over Britain's refusal to back down in a 
balance of power dispute over voting rights, Danish Foreign 
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said here Tuesday [15 March]. 
  He was speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers which 
was deadlocked over the voting issue, which is holding up the 
entry of Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into the EU on 
January 1 next year. 
  "The EU is heading towards a very serious crisis. This 
really is serious," Petersen angrily told journalists. 
  EU enlargement is being blocked by London's demand, backed 
by 
Spain, that the entry of more small countries into the EU should 
not dilute the ability of bigger members like Britain to block 
decisions they do not like. 
  The Danish minister suggested that it was a waste of time 
continuing to negotiate with Britain, because "it is out of the 
question that it will give in today." 
  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he doubted whether 
a compromise was in sight, despite telephone contact earlier in 
the day between German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime 
Minister John Major. 
  But several ministers said agreement was near in a dispute 
between Spain and Norway over fishing catch quotas which 
threatens to stop Norway from entering the Union with the three 
other applicants. 
  Austria, Finland and Sweden finally agreed on their terms of 
membership for joining the EU on March 1. The EU's negotiations 
with Oslo are still blocked by Spain's demand for access to 
Norway's fish-rich waters. 
  Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques Poos said: "We are very 
close to an agreement on fish. Diplomats said Norway, together 
with Spain's EU partners, might buy off the Spanish opposition 
to Norwegian membership with more fish." 
  The more intractable balance of power deadlock hinges on the 
effect of enlargement on the EU's delicately-balanced system of 
majority voting. 
  It provides that the bigger members such as Britain, France 
and Germany have more votes than their smaller partners, but 
fewer votes in relation to their populations. 
  The current system allows one small and two large countries 
to band together in a blocking minority with 30 percent of the 
total votes. 
  Most EU countries want to keep this proportion unchanged 
when 
the four applicants join the Union. But this would raise the 
blocking minority threshhold and three countries would no longer 
have the power of veto. 
  It would mean that Spain, Italy and Greece, for example, can 
no longer block decisions they believe are bad for Mediterranean 
agriculture. 
  Britain, Germany and Denmark or the Netherlands would lose 
their power to block trade regulations backed by the EU's more 
protectionist members. 
  Britain's stand accords with its general policy to keep the 
EU's power as limited as possible. Its opponents accuse the 
British of wanting to paralyse the decision-making process. 
  Spain is wary of any enlargement that would shift the EU's 
balance of power away from the agricultural south to the 
industrial north, which might be less inclined to subsidise 
Mediterranean farmers. 
  The dispute heralds a wider ideological dispute between 
federalists and free traders at a 1996 conference to change EU 
rules before the Union decides on accepting such countries as 
Malta, Cyprus, Poland and Hungary.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
took a major step towards widening its ranks here early 
Wednesday [16 March] by accepting Norway's application two weeks 
after agreeing to take in Austria, Finland and Sweden. 
  In a 13-hour meeting that ended after midnight, EU foreign 
ministers also narrowed the gap in an internal split over voting 
rights which was threatening to block the entry of all four 
applicants into the Union by January 1. 
  The Greek chairman of the EU's Council of Ministers, 
Theodoros Pangalos, said: "I think we can give out a message of 
optimism to the people of Europe. It is a sign of strength that 
Europe can work together well." 
  Pangalos added that impetus had been given to proposals for 
a 
further enlargement of the Union -- initially to take in Cyprus 
and Malta, then other applicants which include Hungary, Poland 
and the Czech Republic. 
  The EU ministers hammered out a compromise deal to give the 
EU's poorer countries, particularly Spain, limited access to 
Norwegian fishing waters plus bigger catch quotas in other 
fishing grounds. 
  The negotiations had been blocked earlier by Spain's 
insistence on access to Norway's fish-rich waters as part of 
Norway's price for EU membership, and Oslo's refusal to open up 
its carefully-husbanded fishing grounds. 
  But the meeting could not overcome Britain's refusal to give 
way in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial 
councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take 
account of the four new members. 
  The ministers agreed to meet again next Tuesday in their 
fourth attempt to resolve the dispute amid signs that a 
compromise might be in sight to let Britain back down without 
too much political damage at home. 
  Pangalos warned that the Union would be in trouble if the 
issue was not resolved. "The whole of community life would be at 
a dead end. I do not think this is possible," he said. 
  Britain, with some backing from Spain, was demanding that 
the 
entry of four small countries into the EU should not tilt the 
balance of power in the EU by diluting the ability of bigger 
members to block decisions they do not like. 
  The argument hinges on the system of weighted majority 
voting 
in ministerial councils. Under current procedures, 23 out of 76 
votes divided up among the 12 members -- 30 percent -- are 
enough to block majority decisions. 
  Such a blocking minority can be formed by one small and two 
large countries. Most members want to keep the 30 percent 
threshhold so that 27 out of 90 votes would be necessary for a 
blocking minority after the four applicants join. 
  Britain and Spain objected because this would mean three 
countries could no longer form a blocking minority, so that 
London and Madrid would have a harder time defending their 
interests. 
  But Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes said Spain was 
leaning towards the majority view on the issue. "I can't see 
Britain alone being prepared to shoulder the blame for 
preventing enlargement (of the EU)," he said. 
  Some diplomats suggested that the British opposition was 
more 
cosmetic than real, aimed at appeasing anti-Europe sentiment 
back home which could be damaging to the government of Prime 
Minister John Major. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there had been 
understanding for the British point of view, despite the charge 
from his Danish colleague, Niels Helveg Petersen, that London 
was driving the enlargement drive into crisis. 
  Hurd suggested that progress might be made on Tuesday. "We 
want enlargement but we do not want that to weaken minorities," 
he said. 
  Pangalos proposed a compromise -- that the blocking 
threshhold should be raised to 27 pending a major review of EU 
rules in 1996, but that the interests of minority groupings 
would be treated sympathetically in the meanwhile. 
  The dispute must be resolved by the end of March if the four 
applicant countries are to have any chance of joining the EU by 
the target date of January 1 next year.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Luxembourg Foreign Affairs </F>
Minister Jacques Poos by Wim Brummelman in Luxembourg on 12 
March: "Our Relationship Is an Example for Europe"] 
  [Text] Luxembourg, 12 March -- Just as Alfons Verplaetse, 
the governor of the National Bank of Belgium, fights not only 
for the credibility of the Belgian currency, but also for the 
stability of the Luxembourg franc, so do Netherlands diplomats 
look after the interests of not only the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands, but also those of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg in 
many parts of the world. 
  The Netherlands has embassies in 87 countries, whereas 
Luxembourg has representations in only 19 countries. That is 
why Netherlands diplomats act on behalf of Luxembourg if that is 
convenient. They prepare visits by political and trade 
missions, and Luxembourg subjects can turn to Netherlands 
embassies if they need help. 
  This is a unique form of diplomatic cooperation which, 
according to Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques F. Poos, would 
serve as "a good example" for other member states of the 
European Union to combine their powers. With the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the dismantling of the Soviet Union, some 20 new 
states have already been created in Europe alone. It is very 
expensive to open diplomatic posts in all these countries. That 
is why the small- and medium-sized member states of the European 
Union would be well-advised to open joint representations in the 
future, Poos said. 
  The diplomatic cooperation between Luxembourg and the 
Netherlands stretches back to the last century when Luxembourg 
was made a Grand Duchy in personal union with the Netherlands 
under the terms of the Vienna Congress. The first of April will 
mark the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of an official 
cooperation treaty between the two countries. In order to 
celebrate the anniversary, Minister Poos today opened -- 
together with Prime Minister Santer (who is also minister of 
culture) and in the presence of Foreign Minister Kooijmans -- an 
exhibition of Netherlands and Luxembourg artists at the Musee 
National d'Art et d'Histoire. The exhibition will travel to our 
country in May. 
  Poos' desire to have the Luxembourg-Netherlands example 
imitated contrasted sharply with the humiliating experience the 
minister had earlier this week in Brussels during the 
enlargement negotiations for the EU. Norway's accession looked 
like it was going to be blocked by 7,000 tonnes of cod. In 
addition, the membership of Sweden, Finland, and Austria was 
seriously jeopardized by the frontal assault which Great Britain 
and Spain launched against the position of the smaller member 
states in particular in the Council of Ministers. 
  To the rage of most of the EU member states, London and 
Madrid refused to raise the threshold of the blocking minority 
from 23 to 27 votes. By taking this hard-line position, both 
governments put a heavy advance burden on the intergovernmental 
conference to be held in 1996 on the future structure of the EU. 
During that conference the administrative coherence of the EU 
is to be reinforced to such a degree that by the end of the 
decade the following step -- the inclusion of countries from 
Central and East Europe -- can be made flawlessly. 
  The 58-year-old Poos is clearly disappointed. "Nobody 
understands the attitude taken by Spain and Great Britain which 
provoked this discussion and jeopardized the current 
enlargement. Everyone is guessing at the underlying 
considerations," he said. "Naturally, the Union will have a 
different geographical configuration after the enlargement. The 
weight of northern Europe and the weight of Germany -- through 
the adhesion of Austria -- will be reinforced. But surely that 
is nothing new? That was already known a year and a half ago 
when, at the European summit in Lisbon, we decided that 
enlargement should take place quickly and that this accession 
would still fit in with the existing institutional relations. 
The Spanish and British prime ministers were there and said 
`yes.' Now the time has come for a signature, and they are 
saying `no.' They have assumed a serious responsibility in 
doing so, but I have not yet given up hope that this crisis can 
still be overcome in the coming days." 
  [Netherlands] State Secretary Piet Dankert said this week 
that the debate on the voting position must be taken up at the 
intergovernmental conference in 1996, when all institutional 
changes must be put on the agenda. "I am not saying that in 
1996 the Netherlands will definitely agree with 23 votes," 
Dankert said. Poos agrees completely with this position. "Nobody 
currently has a clear blueprint" for the future structure of the 
Union, he said. However, "everyone does agree that the EU must 
remain efficient, and the fundamental principle of equality of 
the countries must not disappear," Poos stated Luxembourg's 
position. His government is not looking forward to an 
institutional revolution. After 1996, too, the maintenance of 
Luxembourg's national identity as a founding father of the 
united Europe is a priority. 
  This implies, among other things, that the Grand Duchy is 
firmly committed to having a representative in the European 
Commission. The suggestion of appointing, say, one commissioner 
for the Benelux countries -- once the EU has been enlarged -- in 
order to keep the size of the European Commission under control 
is unthinkable for the Luxembourg Government. "No, no, no. 
That would be unacceptable to the Luxembourg parliament, and 
also for the Netherlands parliament. We are not yet that far 
advanced with the federal Europe," Poos said. According to him, 
"it is up to the Commission, and not the member states" to find 
a meaningful distribution of work. 
  According to Poos, there should also be talk of things 
besides the expansion of the powers of the European Parliament. 
"I am convinced that the national parliaments will claim their 
share of powers in the European decisionmaking process. The 
role of the national parliaments at the European level has only 
grown in recent years. Europe's democratic legitimacy has two 
pillars: one in Strasbourg and one in the national parliaments." 
  When speaking of national identity you inevitably come to 
the 
status of Luxembourg as a financial center. Germany, which will 
take over the EU presidency this summer, has already hinted it 
will submit plans for a European tax on interest income. Bonn 
hopes to curb capital flight to neighboring Luxembourg in this 
way, but the Luxembourg Government will not cooperate, Poos 
announced. Such a proposal is "not acceptable" because that 
would start off a capital flight not only from Luxembourg but 
from the entire European Union to financial centers outside the 
Community. "We will not move as long as gaps inside and outside 
the Community remain unplugged," Poos said. 
  He can say that easily because decisions in this area must 
be 
made unanimously and not with a majority of the votes. "We 
therefore do not need a blocking minority. We have a veto, but 
we do not stand alone here. The British, too, do not favor 
this, nor do other countries, such as the Netherlands." 
  Poos the economist is optimistic that the majority of EU 
member states can move on to the third phase of economic and 
monetary union [EMU] in 1997, and that "the ECU will become the 
currency of Luxembourg." Last year, when the Belgian franc 
dropped sharply, there were even rumors that Luxembourg wanted 
to break off the monetary union with Belgium. However, said 
Poos, that would be "a catastrophic option, which we do not even 
want to think about seriously." He simply said that Belgium 
would be in a position to move on to EMU along with Luxembourg 
in 1997. 
  Poos' optimism was further strengthened with the visit by 
Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski to Luxembourg this 
week. The economic recovery is already under way in the United 
States, as well as in several East European countries. Economic 
growth in Poland is now around 4 percent, according to 
Olechowski. 
  That offers hope. Poos is counting on countries like Poland, 
Hungary, and the Czech Republic to become members of the 
European Union before the end of the century. "We have no 
alternative. If we say `no,' we will send them back into chaos. 
Then we would perhaps be responsible if the democratic 
governments in these countries were overthrown. That is why we 
must say `yes,' and why we have already said `yes.' The only 
thing is we cannot yet give an exact date."
