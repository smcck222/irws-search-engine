<F P=106> [Arthur Leathley: "CBI Chief Attacks Way Britain Is Run"] </F>
  [Text] The leader of Britain's employers, the 
Confederation of British Industry [CBI], last night demanded 
wide-ranging changes in central and local government and in 
Britain's European role. 
  Howard Davies director-general of the CBI set out a 
catalogue 
of reforms which called into question the fabric of 
decision-making in Britain. Local government was at the head of 
what he described as "a menu of modest proposals" which would 
require an overhauling of the way that the public sector was run 
at regional and local level. 
  Mr Davies, speaking to the European Policy Forum, an 
independent think tank, demanded that central government should 
allow local councils greater flexibility over their own 
functions, particularly through greater control of their own 
money. 
  Wider sources of revenue, such as channelling vehicle excise 
duty to local councils, would help to make local authorities 
self-financing, while national services, such as education, 
should be taken out of local authority control. 
  Mr Davies said that, although he respected the strengths of 
Parliament, there was widespread concern about whether it was 
effective in preparing legislation. 
  His intervention comes at a sensitive time for the 
Government 
as it faces criticism for its handling of local government. 
  Voicing the concerns of the business community, Mr Davies 
said there was a need for a regional dimension for handling 
transport and planning needs. 
  Many local authorities were "small-minded, grotesquely 
inefficient and generally awful," and were "in desperate need of 
reform." 
  However, even after 144 pieces of legislation under the Tory 
Government, Mr Davies insisted last night that "we are left with 
much confusion and conflict." 
  He called for more extensive consultation with outside 
bodies 
before Bills were drafted, and said that interested parties 
should be called to give evidence to MPs scrutinising new 
legislation. There should also be periodic review of the 
operation of legislation, which would allow input from outside 
bodies. 
  His pressure for change will strike a chord with many MPs of 
all parties who are concerned that the relationship between 
local and central government has become increasingly strained.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov on 
Tuesday [15 March] in Bonn described the Greek embargo against 
his country as a danger to the stability in the entire region. 
Gligorov, who along with Slovene President Milan Kucan was 
invited to a Europe Dialogue Forum sponsored by Bundestag 
President Rita Suessmuth, underlined his readiness for immediate 
talks with the participation of UN mediator Cyrus Vance. 
  For two years, Greece has been trying "irrationally and 
emotionally" to prevent international recognition of The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. The Macedonian 
president once more denied any territorial claims on the Greek 
province of the same name and emphasized the need for a peaceful 
agreement. "Our objective is the Europeanization of the 
Balkans," Gligorov said. 
  Slovene President Kucan, who had come on a private visit to 
Bonn just like Gligorov, said that implementing the market 
economy and full integration into Europe was his supreme 
objective. Both presidents were planning to pay a courtesy call 
on Federal President Richard von Weizsaecker on Tuesday.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Defense Minister Volker 
Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the German armed 
forces now have to be geared toward future tasks as far as their 
abilities and structures are concerned. After the Federal 
Cabinet adopted the "1994 white paper" on Tuesday [15 March], 
Ruehe told the press that the compulsory military service system 
would remain a "constituent element of the Bundeswehr." 
  The army is underfinanced, and its duties and funds must now 
be harmonized, Ruehe said. The important thing is to carry out 
consistent streamlining schemes now. He had ordered the 
necessary studies, the minister said. The ratio between 
investments and operational spending must be improved to the 
advantage of investments. The Bundeswehr must remain efficient 
and modern. 
  By reducing the strength of the armed forces to a maximum of 
370,000 men, as agreed in a treaty concluded between Federal 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 
the Caucasus in 1990, this process will be largely concluded. 
Ruehe emphasized that precedence has to be given to the 
establishment of readily available crisis reaction forces. 
  Germany must be able to participate in all UN tasks without 
any reservations. The Federal Government is ready to assume 
this responsibility. Clarifying the constitutional basis for 
all Bundeswehr missions is thus in the interest of the 
predictability of Germany's foreign and security policy and in 
the interest of the Bundeswehr. NATO's, the European Union's, 
the CSCE's, and the United Nations's ability for 
crisis-management must improve. 
  The army needs light, air mobile, and air mechanized units 
for the crisis reaction forces. In addition, air transport 
capacities must be extended. The navy must also provide forces 
for crisis reaction. According to Ruehe, the Bundeswehr's 
"control and strategic surveillance capability" are of vital 
importance in this connection. It must be possible to transfer 
armed forces contingents over large distances by sea and air. 
In this connection it is also important to secure the supply 
for these forces. 
  Ruehe pointed out that, since 1990, the Bundeswehr has been 
engaged in the greatest transformation process in its history. 
The white paper, due to appear on 5 April, shows that Germany's 
security is now higher than ever before, Ruehe said. Never 
before has Germany's strategic situation been as favorable as it 
is now. "Today we are surrounded only by friends and 
democracies, all of Germany is enjoying the protection of NATO 
and the European Union." 
  The current document is the ninth white paper. The last 
report was issued in 1985 by Manfred Woerner, who was the CDU 
defense minister at the time. The first white paper on security 
policy was published in 1969 during the era of the Grand 
Coalition.

  [Text] Bonn -- Despite its tough austerity course, the 
Federal Government will stick to the planned strength of the 
Bundeswehr of 370,000 men. According to the most recent white 
paper entitled "On the security of the FRG and on the situation 
and the future of the Bundeswehr," which will be presented by 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe on Tuesday [15 March], the German 
armed forces will consist of 39,700 officers, 133,300 
noncommissioned officers, 38,000 privates who sign up for a 
certain period of time, and 155,000 conscripts doing basic 
military service. A total of 4,000 reserve duty training places 
will be available. 
  As DPA learned from reliable sources today, the 
establishment 
of the crisis reaction forces will be given top priority. 
"Together with its partners, the Bundeswehr must be in a 
position to transfer, deploy, control and support troop 
contingents to a limited extent but within a short time under 
extreme environmental conditions across long distances," the 
white paper stresses. The climate and geographic conditions 
outside Europe require suitable material equipment and personal 
outfit for the soldiers. To control operations of the crisis 
reaction forces of the Bundeswehr, far-reaching reconnaissance 
resources and communication are required. 
  Air transport will play a major role in supporting the 
operations of the crisis reaction forces. "Air transport is an 
essential precondition for the extended tasks of all military 
services that support the operations of the crisis reaction 
forces, peace missions, and humanitarian operations," the 
comprehensive report points out. Regarding the future transport 
requirements of the crisis reaction forces, one must bear in 
mind that the bulk of the equipment and part of the personnel 
are usually transported by sea, but it must be possible to 
transfer troops with several battalions and their support units 
quickly and on a large-scale basis by air. 
  According to the white paper, Germany's full sovereignty, 
resulting from the unification of both parts of Germany, and the 
extended tasks of the Bundeswehr represent a new challenge for 
the command and control organization of the armed forces. To 
make participation in peace missions under UN auspices and in 
humanitarian operations possible, the Federal Government must be 
able in the future to control the Bundeswehr as a sovereign 
army. The leadership structures in the Defense Ministry must be 
streamlined. The number of staff sections, subdivisions, and 
other sections will be "clearly reduced." 
  The white paper contains clear support for compulsory 
military service because it ensure the operational readiness of 
the Bundeswehr. Because of the tight financial situation, the 
armed forces renounced important projects. For the period 
between 1995-1997, the defense budget will involve 47.5 billion 
German marks. The Bundeswehr will keep the three military 
services; army, air force, and navy.

  [Text] Bonn -- The defense expert of the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany, Walter Kolbow, has described the government's 
report on the Bundeswehr as a "white paper of helplessness." In 
an interview with the private FFH radio station in Hesse, Kolbow 
stated that Ruehe described the world situation but forgot to 
explain the future development of the Bundeswehr in such a way 
that the soldiers know what they have to expect and where the 
army is going. The white paper mentions neither the future 
strength of the Bundeswehr nor details concerning compulsory 
military service. 
  The member of the Free Democratic Party of Germany Juergen 
Koppelin stated that the adherence to a strength of 370,000 men 
is not suitable for "discussing the future of the Bundeswehr in 
an unbiased way." This is more wishful thanking that does not 
correspond to the reality. The Bundeswehr will be reduced to 
345,000 soldiers by the end of 1994. 
  The defense spokesman of the Christian Democratic 
Union/Christian Social Union, Paul Breuer, however, praised the 
"1994 white paper." He described it as a balance sheet and 
important document determining the future of the Bundeswehr. 
The reduction of the number of soldiers to 300,000 by 1996, as 
claimed by the Social Democrats, serves a "short-sighted 
populism and is dangerous for Germany's external security."

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [15 March] the Federal 
Government adopted the ratification law for the association 
treaties of the European Union [EU] with the Czech Reublic and 
the Slovak Republic. The agreements replace the treaty with the 
dissolved CSFR. They are oriented toward the EU agreements with 
Poland and Hungary and envisage a further opening up of the 
market, as the FRG Economics Ministry announced. In contrast to 
the old agreement with the CSFR, the new agreements permit an 
immediate unilateral cancellation of the treaties in case of 
severe violations of the principles of democracy and of human or 
minority rights.

this decision, Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer 
(Alliance 90/Greens) gave in in the dispute with Federal 
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union). 
  The ministry in Wiesbaden stated that the decree issued 11 
days ago after a fire in the reactor can be lifted. According 
to the decree, preparations for a renewed operation of the 
reactor had to be stopped after the regular revision. 
  It was also announced that the evaluation of the expert 
reports commissioned by Fischer and Toepfer, which came to 
different conclusions, did not reveal any findings that would 
have required a closure of the plant.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta Blames High Finance for </F>
Privatisation Hold-Ups"] 
  [Text] Bologna, 12 Mar (ANSA) -- High finance has been 
instrumental in holding up Italy's ambitious but slow-moving 
privatisation process, Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, a 
respected economist, said Saturday [12 March]. 
  At a meeting of European business managers here, the foreign 
minister said "for the past twelve months I have been asking for 
consultants to be named to get the privatisations of STET [Turin 
Telephone Finance Company], ENEL [National Electric Power Board] 
and the petrol sector off the ground." 
  "Well," said Andreatta, who served as budget minister in the 
government of Giuliano Amato which gave a push to the 
privatisation process, "these nominations have been frozen for 
twelve months, in a subtle game in which the great potentates of 
high finance have played their part." 
  "I am not claiming," he went on, "that there is some kind of 
feud between some politicians and high finance. Personally I am 
convinced that we need to keep checks on the influence of high 
finance.... In the past few months I have seen thousands of 
objections raised by high finance to a process that must be done 
well, following the example set in Britain and France." 
  The foreign minister voiced worries that some areas of large 
industry are suggesting that partnerships should be limited to 
those with industry in France. "But I do not think that deals 
between two countries with rather interventionist tendencies 
would be the best thing for our privatisation process." 
  The possibility of the privatisation process being wound 
down 
by the winners of the March 27-28 general elections was played 
down by Andreatta who forecast a governing alliance which 
differed considerably from the coalitions as they head into the 
vote. 
  "And in this reorganisation, I think that intermediate force 
will prevail in the left-wing, right-wing and centrist line-ups, 
allowing a continuation with the action set in motion by the 
Amato government and (the current) government of (Carlo Azeglio) 
Ciampi, privatisations included," he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ties Between Left-Wing Parties, </F>
Cooperatives Probed"] 
  [Excerpts] Rome, 14 Mar (ANSA) -- Investigations into the 
eventual funding of Italy's major left-wing parties by 
construction and other cooperatives enjoying close links with 
the Left are continuing apace, judicial sources said here this 
afternoon as they confirmed that the names of leading officials 
in the Democratic Party of the Left, the major opposition party, 
have been mentioned during the enquiries. 
  Disclosing that some sections of the enquiry have been 
handed 
over to the Milanese prosecutor's office, the sources said the 
Left Democrat Party officials whose names have come up during 
the collection of evidence include Party Secretary Achille 
Occhetto, his right-hand man Massimo D'Alema, and others. 
  Yesterday, Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, an 
ex-Christian Democrat, said in an electoral speech in Pisa that 
the investigators had so far shown "little curiosity" about 
contracts granted left-wing cooperatives. 
  According to Andreatta's charges, the left-wing parties 
seemed to be unaware of the way in which many of the present 
cases involving crimes against the public finances included 
agreements drawn up to leave space for these cooperatives, 
especially in those working in construction. 
  In particular, he mentioned, but failed to identify more 
precisely cases in Milan in 1975, in Sicily, in the area covered 
by the former Fund for the Mezzogiorno to finance development in 
southern Italy, and in aid projects, for example in Mozambique. 
[passage omitted] 
  Judicial sources, who disclosed that a meeting of 
investigators here this morning covered the state of play in the 
investigations and speculated that they may extend more widely, 
confirmed that Occhetto and others were on the list of those who 
had entered the enquiries, a formal procedure for anyone whose 
name crops up during the collection of evidence, but far short 
of issuing any form of subpoena or warrant. 
  The judicial sources said that all the cases in question 
were 
among those mentioned in a dossier submitted to the Roman 
judicial authorities in February by former Socialist Party 
Secretary Bettino Craxi, himself under multiple investigation 
for accusations of massive corruption, illegal party funding, 
and other misdeeds. 
  The sources said that the cases extracted from the dossier 
and handed on to the Milanese prosecutors include the building 
of the Milanese subway and the re-building of Malpensa Airport; 
the installation of emission purification plant at Brindisi 
power station; and various bribes allegedly paid for 
construction contracts. [passage omitted] 
  The sources said the Rome prosecutor's office has kept the 
section of Craxi's dossier alleging that the ex-Communist Party 
received illicit funding from East Europe. Many of the charges 
within the competence of the Milanese investigators have already 
been shelved for some defendants, only to be exhumed when Craxi 
cited the names of Occhetto, D'Alema and the others in Rome. 
  The Left Democrat Party's lawyer, Guido Calvi, pointed out 
that the various names involved had been registered in Rome on 
the list of those whose names appear in an enquiry only on the 
basis of Craxi's allegations. In a further step, as the result 
of a recent agreement between the Turin, Milanese, Roman and 
Venetian judiciaries, the investigators agreed to criteria for 
territorial competence in anti-corruption enquiries whereby the 
Roman magistrates have now sent back those sections of Craxi's 
allegations that "could find no roots in Rome," Calvi noted. 
  "Nothing more has happened, and nothing more could happen, 
since Milan has been investigating the subway and Malpensa for 
over a year, and the preliminary hearings are now very close," 
said the lawyer, who also appealed for respect for the facts of 
the case: "The rest is pure, shameful electoral speculation". 
  A statement from the Left Democrat Party also pointed out 
that entering a name on the register of those entering an 
enquiry is a "formal obligation which is therefore automatic." 
The statement also reiterated the Left Democrats' conviction 
that Craxi's allegations were based on "slanderous and unfounded 
accusations destined solely to set up hurdles and traps on the 
path of justice." 
  Meanwhile, in a radio interview, Milan's Chief Prosecutor 
Saverio Borrelli said that, "after deep thought," his office has 
decided to pursue its anti-corruption investigations "as if 
there was no electoral season." "I would be a hypocrite if I 
said the problem doesn't exist," added Borrelli of the debate 
over whether the enquiries should proceed during the campaign 
for the March 27/28 vote, but he also pointed out that, if the 
investigators were to allow their work to be conditioned by 
political circumstances as regards "timing, let alone 
substance," accusations of having pursued political criteria in 
rendering justice would surely follow. 
  "Even delaying acts for which the time is ripe in strictly 
judicial terms could be a choice representing a favour to one 
political side and a disfavour to another, and tomorrow could 
represent a reason for blame," he noted. In other points, he 
said it was a simple rule of "good civic education" to read the 
acts of the magistrature for what they are and for what they 
"objectively appear as." 
  "I think it is uncivil...to try to psychoanalyse a measure, 
carrying out psychoanalysis of the motivation in order to claim 
that the words say one thing, but underneath them there is 
something else."

("we will never join a government with the PDS, unless it is an 
institutional government") or with the right-wing front. 
  He received a polemical response from National Alliance 
coordinator Gianfranco Fini in Gorizia: "Center voters must 
realize that by voting for the PPI, they are voting for a carbon 
copy of Occhetto's party." 
  But Segni went further than that, accusing [Forza Italia 
leader] Berlusconi on the one hand and the PDS on the other of 
maintaining a similar stance with regard to their 
conflict-ridden relations with the judiciary. Segni, speaking 
at a public rally with [Italian Republican Party Secretary] 
Giorgio La Malfa, cited the statement submitted by Silvio 
Berlusconi to the head of state to criticize the action of the 
Milan judges, describing it as "a serious matter, a very serious 
matter." He added: "Occhetto used to praise the judges when 
they arrested his adversaries. The moment he is affected in 
some way, he starts attacking them. Berlusconi, however, 
started right away. You have to decide: Either you respect the 
judiciary or you do not. We do respect them, and we act in such 
a way as to enable them to do their job freely." This elicited 
an immediate response from PDS headquarters: "Segni, that soul 
in torment, has decided to step into old Forlani's shoes. But 
apart from being a diehard Forlani-like man, he is also a liar. 
And you cannot build anything on lies." 
  "If Berlusconi feels that he is under attack, he can respond 
however he likes," Giorgio La Malfa commented, "but he must 
realize that these are the pains of political life. Perhaps, 
being a businessman, he is not accustomed to this kind of 
atmosphere." 
  Mino Martinazzoli reaffirmed his fear that "some coarse 
victor may imagine that the issue of the power of the judiciary 
can be resolved by reducing their autonomy and independence." 
  The Popular Party secretary stressed: "When the hunt for 
Christian Democrats began, everything was fine, because the 
judicial instrument was being used in the political struggle. 
We never indulged in insults and invective, so we are entitled 
to express amusement at the fact that certain other people start 
shouting the moment any initiative impinges on their territiry."

<F P=106> [Interview with Massimo d'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F>
Italian Democratic Party of the Left, by Francesco Verderami in 
Gallipoli; date not given: "d'Alema: Ciampi for 
Reconstruction"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Verderami] What about all the 
rumors on constituent or institutional governments? What about 
the hypotheses concerning [Budget Minister] Spaventa, and the 
murmurings about [the chairman of the Institute for Industrial 
Reconstruction, IRI] Prodi? 
  [d'Alema] So much empty talk. Our job is not to study 
farfetched formulas, but to give precise indications as to what 
we are prepared to do if we win the elections. 
  [Verderami] Without first reaching an agreement with the 
center? 
  [d'Alema] We must not announce an alliance with the center, 
but rather, with the citizens. In fact, the center might be 
irrelevant in the next parliament. The real problem is a 
different one: The electoral campaign is beginning now, and the 
opinion polls indicate an essentially balanced situation between 
the progressives and the right, with the center losing votes. 
Now, there is a considerable proportion of undecided voters. 
We are now in the run-up. Within the next few days the balance 
may turn in favor of one of the two alignments. So, although it 
may be premature to think in terms of a coalition after the 
elections, it is not premature, however, to think in terms of 
the government. The government constitutes the fundamental 
issue distinguishing the two alignments, and it is also the 
issue on which the progressive alliance has an advantage. 
  [Verderami] Well, on the right there is [Forza Italia 
leader] 
Berlusconi running for the premiership.... 
  [d'Alema] Berlusconi's electoral campaign is similar to 
Craxi's in 1992. If, like Craxi, he does not win, his plans 
will collapse, and after a while he will move abroad. In any 
case, his leadership has been called into question by [League 
Secretary] Bossi. This means that a right-wing victory might 
open up the prospect of ungovernability. The progressives, on 
the other hand, are showing greater cohesiveness. The more 
guarantees we are capable of offering in terms of governability, 
the greater our chances of prevailing. 
  [Verderami] Have you explained this to [Communist Renewal 
Secretary] Bertinotti? 
  [d'Alema] Communist Renewal is excessively preoccupied with 
the need to establish its own identity, and in doing so it has 
not always made the right move. In fact, it would be well 
advised not to force matters just for propaganda purposes. 
However, I think Communist Renewal's case is receiving too much 
attention. In the final analysis, it is only a limited radical 
component within a much broader alignment. Communist Renewal is 
welcome to adopt any platform that it wishes, but, of course, it 
cannot possibly expect some of its proposals to be included in 
the platform of a government supported by the progressives. If 
Communist Renewal should propose taxing treasury bills and 
leaving NATO, this would be a reason for not forming a 
government together. 
  [Verderami] Do you draw a distinction between the 
progressives and Communist Renewal? 
  [d'Alema] If the progressives win a majority, they will 
guarantee a national reconstruction government for the country, 
not a left-wing government: a government committed to economic 
recovery and improving the employment situation; a government 
which will make the welfare system more efficient and uphold the 
principle of solidarity; a government which will propose a more 
authoritative and, at the same time, a less invasive, meddling 
type of state. I am speaking of the invasiveness of political 
power... 
  [Verderami] ...and of judiciary power? 
  [d`Alema] Yes. I believe, for example, that the electoral 
campaign must today consist of a political debate on the 
country's problems rather than being conducted on the basis of 
information leaked from the courts of justice... These are the 
objectives of a national reconstruction government, within a 
framework conditioned by the need to pursue a financial recovery 
policy. This perspective could be expressed through a new 
cabinet headed by Ciampi. I repeat: a new cabinet. When I 
refer to the current prime minister I am not referring to the 
current ministerial make-up. 
  [Verderami] Is Ciampi therefore the progressive's candidate 
for the premiership? 
  [d'Alema] Let us be clear. I am not saying that Ciampi is 
the head of the progressives. We do not have a presidential 
system in Italy, and we have no need to nominate a head of state 
in order to get people to vote for us. 
  [Verderami] However, Ciampi is saying that he would rather 
see a member of parliament at Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's 
office] in the near future. 
  [d'Alema] In my view, if at present the progressives are 
prepared to support this sort of government -- leaving aside the 
prerogatives of the head of state, and Ciampi's intentions -- 
this would be the wisest solution. This solution is necessary 
by the current stage of events, but it is not a concession that 
we owe anybody. In any case, the new government should mark a 
change in relation to the past. I am thinking, for example, of 
the Interior Ministry... 
  [Verderami] With d'Alema replacing [current Interior 
Minister] Mancino? 
  [d'Alema] It is not one of d'Alema's prerogatives to name 
ministers. However, it would not be with d'Alema in The 
Viminale [Interior Ministry], if this is what you are suggesting. 
  [Verderami] What about the possibility of Spaventa heading a 
progressive government? 
  [d'Alema] Spaventa is a statesman who, being young, can 
still 
make a contribution to the country for a long time to come. 
However, I believe that, after 28 March, in order to get out of 
the "bottleneck" and recover international credibility, we must 
give signs of stability. 
  [Verderami] Do you believe that your allies will agree with 
you? 
  [d'Alema] Actually, my intention is to address a proposal to 
the progressive candidates: As from today, we should be 
committed to having a consistent attitude after the elections, 
we must work with a view to maintaining cooperation in 
parliament beyond the electoral alliance. I am thinking in 
terms of a single parliamentary group or, at least, a federative 
pact. During this last stage of the electoral campaign, it 
would be important for us to tell voters: We are together 
today, we will be together tomorrow. This would be like 
offering them an investment geared to the future. 
  [Verderami] Are you thinking in terms of a future Democratic 
Party? 
  [d'Alema] I believe that by acting in this way we would 
establish the foundations for a future progressive democratic 
force, within a bipolar, European-type framework, which is what 
Italy should be aiming at. 
  [Verderami] Do you think that everybody will agree on this 
proposal? 
  [d'Alema] The single group will include forces prepared to 
take part in such a project. Of course, there are those who are 
aiming to preserve their own identity. However, what position 
will those candidates adopt who are an expression of civil 
society? And what will be the fate of Democratic Alliance, that 
was set up precisely in order to promote this kind of 
aggregation process? What will happen to the Socialist forces 
that have decided to join the progressives? Should we not be 
thinking in terms of common prospects? In the final analysis, 
we are all part of a single European Socialist party, and I do 
not think that the existence of two different reference points 
in our country will make sense for much longer.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Average Candidate Is Well-Off </F>
Professional, Says Censis"] 
  [Text] Rome, 14 Mar (ANSA) -- The average candidate in the 
race for the Lower House or Senate which will be voted in March 
27 and 28, in Italy's first general election with a mainly 
majority voting system in place, is a professional aged between 
40 and 50, enjoys a declared gross income of 125 million lire 
(75,000 dollars) and is already active in public life. 
  The outlines of a middle-aged, well-educated Rotarian with a 
good income were pencilled in today by Giuseppe De Rita, the 
director general of the Center for Social Investment Studies 
(CENSIS) who also reported that 61 percent of the hopefuls are 
"second string" politicians, with records of service as members 
of municipal, provincial and regional governments. 
  As a result of the devastation wrought on the nation's 
political scene by more than two years of investigations into 
business and public works corruption, illegal political party 
funding and other wrongdoings, candidates who are former MPs 
account for only 17.5 percent of the 4,352 in the running. 
  The head of CENSIS said, on the basis of interviews of 535 
candidates, the uninominal system adopted "will not renew the 
leadership class." In the place of front-rank politicians are 
those arriving from the second and third ranks, lowering the 
Parliament to a super-provincial council. 
  "But even more worrying is the barrier to access, which is 
of 
two types, on the basis of the census and profession," De Rita 
continued. "Future members of parliament will form a nobility 
which will not be easy to replace. There will be a niche, a 
segment of society which is not the general class, without an 
ability to govern. I think we will still have to have Ciampi 
governments which can interpret general interests," said the 
CENSIS secretary general with reference to the premier, former 
Bank of Italy government Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, not a member of 
parliament or a party. 
  According to CENSIS, the arrival to parliament of a 
"multitude" elected in small electoral districts from along 
"low-level leaders" will mean a wealth of "micro-lobbies of the 
old nobility." 
  Back on the figures, CENSIS said 35.9 percent of the 
candidates vaunts degrees in law and another 17.4 percent 
degrees in medicine for a line of "total continuity with the 
tradition in which an elite formed almost exclusively of these 
disciplines always prevailed."

<F P=106> [Report by Dino Vaiano: "The Second Republic Is Born With </F>
an Austerity Finance Bill -- Ministers on a Strict Diet"] 
  [Text] Rome -- The Second Republic's finance bill is taking 
its first steps. With a strict diet for ministers who, next 
year, must keep their budgets riveted to 1994 levels. Entities 
such as the Post Office and the Railways will be able to cover 
"further demands" only through price and tariff increases. The 
basic objective is to ensure a stable relationship between 
public indebtedness and GDP until 1995. The outlines of the 
next three years' austerity program are contained in a circular 
which has just been completed by the Treasury Minister, setting 
out strict criteria for preparing budget forecasts for 1994 and 
for the 1995-97 three-year period. The document issued by the 
State Audit Office also anticipates certain alarming figures 
with regard to this year's government accounts: "The latest 
development of the main indicators leads us to believe that it 
will not be easy to achieve the forecasts of economic growth 
previously formulated for the present year. 
  ``The reduction in the average rate of inflation from the 
4.2 
percent achieved in 1993 to the 3.5 percent figure programmed 
for 1994 could prove problematic. Problems are also possible 
relating to the impact on domestic prices of the monetary 
devaluation. The recent impressive fall in interest rates could 
well flatten out and even come to a halt.'' 
  It will be up to the quarterly cash report to set out, in 
the 
coming weeks, the official government forecasts on public 
finances. It is unlikely to depart substantially from the figure 
of a 15 trillion lira deficit put forward by the Monetary Fund, 
which has scaled down the growth of our economy to a rate of 1.1 
percent. The Treasury warns: "The restrictive approach taken 
in recent years to budget forecasts must be maintained." There 
are no short cuts. The Audit Office indicates as a reference 
point the objectives set out in the monitoring procedure agreed 
to with the European Union. Under attack are the acquisition of 
goods and services, investments, and transfers to decentralized 
entities. The watchword for the next maneuver will be "nominal 
nonvariance." Expenditure on goods and services may not be 
higher than those of 1994, and with an expansion of no more than 
2 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 1997. The Audit Office is 
assuming that a hatchet will be taken to amounts earmarked for 
studies, inquiries, reports, committees, commissions, special 
assignments, and publicity, in order to "arrive at their 
elimination or at least to a significant scaling down." The 
strictures will also apply to defense: "It is necessary to 
proceed to redefine the various plans and projects, taking 
account of the changing international context and the coming 
into operation of the new defense model, with a concomitant 
postponement of expenditures for modernization and development, 
compatible with the implementation of the new programs." 
  But ministers' slimming cure will not be enough. The next 
finance bill will also have to "freeze," for three years, at 
1994 levels, the special funds for new legislative provisions. 
On its last page the circular fixes the broad lines for the 
three-year maneuver: For tax income one can assume a nominal 
GDP growth on the order of 4.5 to 5.0 percent in 1995 and 4.0 to 
4.5 percent in 1996 and 1997. Current 1995 expenses will have 
to be contained within the levels set by the 1994 adjusted 
budget, while expenditure on personnel and the acquisition of 
goods and services essential for the operation of government may 
not grow by more than 2.0 percent in 1996 and 1.5 percent in 
1997. Investments over the three-year period may not grow by 
more than 2.5 percent, 2.0 percent and 1.5 percent respectively.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "British Gas Arrives in Italy"] </F>
  [Text] Milan, 14 Mar (ANSA) -- British Gas, generally 
billed as the world's major privately owned natural gas company, 
opened up shop in Italy today with a press conference announcing 
a readiness to seek investment opportunities from the search for 
new gas fields to transport and distribution. 
  "We've come here with a load of money to spend," quipped 
British Gas Italia Srl's General Manager Fabio Fontana, at the 
head of a company boasting starting capital of 180 million lire 
(about 110,000 dollars) and only four employees, but great 
ambitions, including perhaps a role in the eventual sale of the 
public-sector oil and natural gas company, AGIP [Italian 
National Oil Company]. 
  One immediate aim will be to consolidate British Gas's 
consultancy role with municipal energy companies in Milan, 
Genoa, Trieste and Padua, while also seeking synergies with 
other municipal companies ready to become joint-stock companies 
and "head into new markets." 
  Another major area interest is to extend the company's role 
in co-generation, power-stations in which the thermal energy for 
generating electricity can come from alternative sources such as 
natural gas or coal. 
  A further point of interest for the company may be a 
government plan to open up the search for oil and gas in the Po 
delta to all comers by January 1997. Currently, the concessions 
there are a monopoly of ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], 
the public- sector fuels group, as are contracts for building 
and managing gaslines, which should also be opened up to general 
tender. 
  "We aim to be partners right the way down the gas chain, 
from 
prospection to distribution and transport," confirmed Fontana, 
echoed by British Gas's Director for International Markets, 
Peter Lehmann, who voiced the hope that the gas markets "in 
other countries" would prove to be as open as the British one. 
  Fontana also said that British Gas is interested in full 
industrial partnerships, not "pure financial activities." 
According to Fontana, the aim will be "long-period" agreements 
in which British Gas's share could range from 25-50 percent of 
the capital. He added, however, that an exception to this rule 
could be the AGIP privatisation, thus hinting that British Gas 
could bid for a larger share of AGIP's natural gas or other 
interests. "We don't have a precise figure for investment in 
mind," said Lehmann. "It all depends on what's on offer and how 
good the offers are." 
  On the fringe of the British Gas press conference, Milan's 
Mayor Marco Formentini confirmed plans to privatise the city's 
municipal energy authority, starting with the flotation of 49 
percent of the stock. "We're only interested if we can play an 
industrial role," confirmed Fontana. 
  In other news on the press conference's fringe, the Industry 
Ministry's Director-General for Energy Sources, Giuseppe Gatti, 
confirmed that Italy would fall in line with European Union 
directives by eliminating the monopoly in gas and oil 
prospection by the New Year of 1997. 
  He also produced figures explaining why there was such 
foreign interest in entering the Italian gas market. He said 
that, while European and Italian energy demand fell last year by 
0.7 and 1.3 percent respectively, final-use gas consumption rose 
respectively by 7 percent to 260 Megapet (petroleum equivalent 
tons) and by about 5 percent to 41.7 Megapet. 
  Gatti also said the Industry Ministry's planned energy 
authority would be unveiled in the next few days: "I don't think 
a mega-authority is appropriate. For gas, we want to open up 
the market and make it competitive." 
  British Gas, which is present in 45 countries world-wide, 
has 
70,000 employees and reported turnover of about 10 billion 
pounds, with losses last year of 533 million. The company was 
privatised in 1986.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly Chairman Philippe Seguin </F>
by Denis Jeambar; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Jeambar] You have spent recent months reflecting in 
depth on Europe, the republic, unemployment, and the role of the 
National Assembly, but you have not mentioned the issue of the 
presidential election. Political life, however, is about to 
transform itself into a Balladur-Chirac clash. What do you 
think of this acceleration in the presidency race? 
  [Seguin] What worries me with regard to the presidential 
election is not the fact that the race has started early, but 
the mediocrity of the debate. This two-speed rhythm and 
oversimplification are unfortunately habits of ours. I would 
even say that they unfortunately summarize French politics. 
Everything is a pretext to maintain this supposed clash between 
two figures. Everything is brought down to this one level. Even 
the funerals of foreign heads of state! What more can you say 
without it being immediately interpreted as support for one or 
as an attack on the other? 
  [Jeambar] You must admit that neither man is making much of 
an effort to have it any other way! 
  [Seguin] The climate is such that I think they must find it 
hard not to give in to the temptation to take some pleasure in 
it. 
  [Jeambar] Apart from this competition, what is your main 
concern for the presidential election? 
  [Seguin] In actual fact, I am not sure that we are preparing 
for the right election. After two periods of office by Francois 
Mitterrand, it seems to me to be a good opportunity to return to 
an image of a presidency more in line with the spirit of the 
institutions. 
  [Jeambar] Do you think that spirit has been betrayed, even 
in 
this period of cohabitation? 
  [Seguin] Indeed, some of the misunderstandings between 
myself 
and the prime minister have resulted from this difference in 
opinion concerning the role of the presidency. Cohabitation is 
a period when, unwillingly, the head of state returns to the 
essence of the presidential office. However, the pretenders to 
that office seem more than ever to confuse the presidency with a 
kind of "super prime ministership." 
  [Jeambar] Are you interpreting there the thoughts of the 
prime minister? 
  [Seguin] He is not the first to do this, nor will he be the 
last. It is true that, when you talk of five-year laws, we seem 
to be viewing the presidential election as changing banks -- 
moving over from the prime minister's residence on the left bank 
to the presidential palace on the right bank. But the 
presidential election is about more than that! It is a time 
when a new impetus is given and new directions are indicated for 
the next seven years. It is a decisive renewal which reflects, 
whether you like it or not, public opinion. The president of 
the Republic is not the hierarchical superior of the government. 
The president of the Republic is the continuity of the state, 
representing impartiality and an authority that should be 
recognized by each and every French citizen without exception. 
  [Jeambar] Of course, but the presidents of the Fifth 
Republic 
have always made sure their party was in the majority... 
  [Seguin] There is no link, and there should be no link, 
between the president of the Republic and a parliamentary 
majority. I even abhor the idea of the presidential majority. 
I loathe that notion which lies at the root of the drift of our 
institutions since the demise of General de Gaulle. 
  [Jeambar] We are on the slippery slope, then! 
  [Seguin] If we were not capable of running these 
institutions 
as General de Gaulle wanted them, it would be better to embrace 
a presidential regime. I very much fear that we are preparing 
for the election of a president who will be a kind of super 
prime minister, which would then make the post of prime minister 
totally superfluous. 
  [Jeambar] Does Jacques Chirac favor General de Gaulle's 
approach to the institutions? 
  [Seguin] I hope he will show this to be the case. I would 
like his campaign to be organized in that way, for him to aim 
for the most important aspect. 
  [Jeambar] All that is at stake in the presidential election? 
  [Seguin] The prime minister is right to mention the 
difficulties he is encountering in promoting reform, but this 
has nothing to do with personal inability or cohabitation. 
Quite the contrary for, as he himself recognizes, never before 
has a prime minister had so much room for maneuver. In fact the 
government remains -- legitimately -- within the framework of 
the fundamental choices that were made, or dodged, at the 1988 
presidential election. There is no getting away from it. The 
presidential election is the most important thing. The 
legislative election does not provide the means of effacing that 
fact. 
  [Jeambar] So a period of cohabitation is just a transition 
phase... 
  [Seguin] Indeed, that is the expression I used. There was no 
ill will behind it. I merely meant that, if the prime minister 
was entering the presidential race, he would not be a candidate 
on the strength of his achievements but on a project that he 
would have to present. To speak of achievements as an element 
in the presidential debate -- for Edouard Balladur or anyone 
else -- would be to betray the spirit of our institutions. The 
only one who will have to present a list of achievements in 
1995, to history and to the French people, is Francois 
Mitterrand. I really do want to insist on that point. Jacques 
Chirac -- between 1986 and 1988 -- and Edouard Balladur -- 
between 1993 and 1995 -- were Francois Mitterrand's prime 
ministers. There is no escaping the fact. Yes, we have already 
seen prime ministers with some room for maneuver or who set 
themselves apart by their style, prime ministers who made their 
mark or whom circumstances placed in opposition to the 
president. But, at the end of the day, they all had to tow the 
presidential line or resign, like Jacques Chaban-Delmas in 1972, 
Jacques Chirac in 1976, and Michel Rocard in 1991. 
  [Jeambar] If this idea you have of the presidential election 
does not win the day, could you yourself be drawn to defend it 
in 1995? 
  [Seguin] Now, what could you be driving at? 
  [Jeambar] Would you make sure your voice was heard? 
  [Seguin] That is what I am starting to do with you. 
  [Jeambar] Since the RPR [Rally for the Republic] and the UDF 
[Union for French Democracy] have decided to draw up joint 
voting lists, will you make your voice heard in June's European 
elections? 
  [Seguin] I think it would have been useful to continue the 
debate that began with Maastricht. I try to promote ideas: 
first, the organization of Europe on the continental level; 
second, the reform of the European institutions to ensure a 
better involvement of the national parliaments. That is why I 
am going from capital to capital. Europe has to face up to a 
real challenge. Will everything that happened in the eighties 
simply have the effect of putting the iron curtain back in the 
same position it was in 1938 or 1940 [as published]? We will 
not have made much progress if that is how we end up! Must 
Europe be the last continent incapable of organizing its own 
security? We are still a political dwarf. We must become a 
major continent that can do without outside help. The conflict 
in the former Yugoslavia, coming in the wake of the Gulf war, 
showed our impotence. 
  [Jeambar] Once again, you are going to bring criticism 
raining in on you! 
  [Seguin] Above all, I think I am shaking out a conceptual 
blockage that has taken a crazy turn! In the guise of 
ideological modernity, this country remains restricted by the 
same old plans. On the European level, above all we refuse to 
understand what has happened since 1988. Decentralization and 
local autonomy are another conformism. We fail to realize that 
we have broken down everything that made us strong: the 
coherence and solidarity of this country. I am astounded when I 
hear people talking about a regionalized minimum wage or about a 
decentralization of national authorities that neither lays down 
a direction nor redistributes. 
  [Jeambar] In fact, you always come back to the Republic... 
  [Seguin] What is the Republic but the search for a certain 
level of equal opportunity between men, and between territories? 
It goes without saying that the current practice of 
decentralization is ruining this equal opportunity. It is 
obvious that developments in education risk calling into 
question the equal opportunities of the people. We French are 
molded in such a way that personal happiness is not 
traditionally sought out just by personal growth but also by our 
participation in a collective adventure. 
  [Jeambar] Who is proposing such an adventure? 
  [Seguin] That is just it. As far as adventure goes, we 
cannot say that there is an abundance of it on offer today. Yet 
we feel the need for it, especially young people. We feel that 
something is missing. We are involved in a logic which makes 
politics -- the political choice -- run behind a number of more 
or less written rules, especially financial and economic rules. 
  [Jeambar] In the National Assembly, do not these political 
choices which you mention take a back seat, in other words, do 
they not come second to electoral interests? Charles Pasqua's 
proposal to hold primaries is an example of this which you 
yourself denounced when you said in LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE that 
"one does not make legislation to settle problems involving the 
parties." 
  [Seguin] As far as Parliament is concerned, we have moved 
beyond the stage of malfunction! The national mandate has 
become the secondary mandate for the local mandate. At the 
local level there is a decisionmaking capacity, a margin of 
autonomy, a genuine status, and social recognition -- whereas 
there is increasingly less of this at national level. This 
means that we are becoming an Assembly of representatives of 
local interests, an assembly of feudal lords who come to defend 
the interests of the fief that is their prerogative. 
Nevertheless, I continue to believe that there is a place for 
the national interest and the national debate. 
  [Jeambar] But on what conditions? 
  [Seguin] We must stop believing that our role consists 
solely 
of passing laws. It is primarily a role of controlling the 
government's and the community's actions. There is also a 
debating function aimed at dislodging general guidelines. This 
function can be very useful and positive as long as we have the 
means available to encourage the government to take action. 
  [Jeambar] At the end of the day, what is at stake is the 
future of representative democracy. 
  [Seguin] Of democracy, period! The representative bodies are 
malfunctioning, but the executive bodies themselves are being 
contested. In order to respond to the difficulties, they 
aggravate the problem by passing the buck to authorities which 
supposedly have jurisdiction in the matter, to technocratic 
structures, to committees or communities of wise men, such as 
the CSA [expansion not given], the independent Bank of France, 
and I do not know what else... This movement is aggravated 
further at European level, with a Parliament in Strasbourg 
which, in my opinion, is stillborn. Its multinational nature 
means that it will not be attributed with any democratic 
legitimacy in the foreseeable future. Thus, we are heading 
toward a world in which specialist people -- i.e., the people 
who meet the twin criteria of supposed competence and financial 
means -- will hold the power to the detriment of the legitimate 
representatives. 
  [Jeambar] Hence the obliteration of the political aspect and 
the criticism of politics? 
  [Seguin] Indeed. What amazed me the most in the prime 
minister's reaction to the "social Munich" -- because I did not 
point the finger at him -- was his spontaneous statement: All 
that is just politics. However, politics is the essence of 
democracy! The crisis in our democracy stems precisely from a 
deficit, and not a surfeit, of politics. 
  [Jeambar] Let us continue on this issue of the social 
Munich. 
Nevertheless, you are a supporter of another kind of politics? 
  [Seguin] When I speak of another politics, I do not mean a 
politics which is different from that of the prime minister, I 
mean a politics which is different from that practiced at the 
end of this seven-year presidency. That is completely 
different. It is not Edouard Balladur's politics with which we 
must break in 1995, it is with the choices made by Francois 
Mitterrand. 
  [Jeambar] That is subtle! 
  [Seguin] Not at all. I am thinking more or less that the 
prime minister currently has no other choice, even if at the 
beginning -- in April 1993, as regards interest rates and 
currency -- there was, in my opinion, an alternative. As for 
the rest, I have trouble seeing what one could reproach in 
Edouard Balladur's politics. On the other hand, I would not 
allow someone to say to me: We are going to continue with the 
same policies after the presidential election. No, after that, 
we have to build different foundations. 
  [Jeambar] We are not going to ask you for a program, as we 
would of a potential presidential candidate, but what are these 
foundations? 
  [Seguin] We must finally accept the idea that unemployment 
lies at the heart of everything. It is the cause of all our 
troubles. Will people understand this? Just as there was an 
external constraint that was taken into account very logically 
in the seventies and eighties, there is now the internal 
constraint of unemployment. This is a fundamental datum for the 
equilibrium of France's economy and society. The fight against 
unemployment must take priority. Hence the absolute need to get 
people back to work, even if in jobs that are not spontaneously 
profitable. Then you will actually have a chance of making 
schools efficient again, with children whose parents no longer 
neglect them. 
  [Jeambar] Does that mean that we must not set ourselves a 
goal of economic profitability to create jobs? 
  [Seguin] Of course! 
  [Jeambar] But whom are we going to ask to make this effort? 
Only the local authorities can stand this, not businesses. 
  [Seguin] There is such a thing as the people's business, but 
businesses are also exposed to international competition. They 
must have the means to tackle it and to tackle it victoriously 
in order to bring the product of its victory to all of the 
national collectivity. On the other hand, there is a whole 
series of activities which are not directly exposed to 
international competition and which are so many gold-mines of 
jobs. I would also add that investing today in activities which 
are not spontaneously profitable creates added value for society 
as a whole, while at the same time easing social tensions. I 
think this is glaringly obvious in the education sector. We are 
caught up in a number of vicious circles: schools with sliding 
performance; businesses which lay people off yet must bear more 
and more charges due to the effects of laying people off; etc. 
All of this is taking place in a climate of euphoria! 
Everything must be going well because inflation is under 
control, our currency is stable, and we have a trade surplus... 
  [Jeambar] Are we back to the conformist thinking which you 
already mentioned? 
  [Seguin] Indeed. They tell us: The fundamental economic 
parameters are going well, so therefore the economy is fine, and 
therefore employment is better. 
  [Jeambar] Do you no longer believe in the formula: Growth 
equals full employment? 
  [Seguin] You would really have to be blind to believe that. 
  [Jeambar] Yet many people still believe it. 
  [Seguin] That has not escaped my notice. It is 
inconceivable! 
  [Jeambar] The prime minister is expecting a lot from the 
return of growth. 
  [Seguin] A conceptual effort has been made. It looks as if 
we have rejected it. It is true that there are other countries 
where things are happening in the same way, especially in Europe. 
  [Jeambar] If none of these problems arises, what will you do 
in 1995? 
  [Seguin] I already told you: Do not try and make me say that 
I will raise them if others do not. No! They will end up 
raising these issues, but we will have to insist they do. So I 
am insisting. We must return to being a state worthy of the 
name, in other words an impartial and strong state which is a 
guarantor of the general interest and national solidarity... 
  [Jeambar] Why, is it not currently like that? 
  [Seguin] ...an unassailable state in which everyone can 
recognize themselves, a state which is something other than a 
partner for the local authorities or one local authority among 
others. We must return to a demanding vision of the nation. 
This is not a question of withdrawing into ourselves but a 
question of solidarity and the republican principles of equal 
opportunity and secularism. One state, one nation, and 
necessarily one Republic. It is not simply a matter of doing 
things in such a way that people can live together and support 
each other. It is not a question of policing or organizing. It 
is the willingness to take one's own destiny in hand, and that 
is done through political action. 
  [Jeambar] In this context, how do you view the role of the 
parties? 
  [Seguin] I must say that they have become fan clubs. A 
party, however, is something completely different: It is a 
place where one goes to try and build something. Here we come 
across another problem: ideologies have crumbled. This is true 
but it does not mean that there is no longer any room for 
politics. It only means that there are no more turnkey systems. 
The parties must act as laboratories, and places for debate, 
research, proposals, and preparation for teams likely to 
subsequently implement certain solutions which have been thus 
defined and sketched out. However, today, the parties are 
evolving between uselessness and encroachment. Indeed, they are 
seeking to carry weight in areas where they should not carry 
weight. During the formation of the 1986 and 1993 governments I 
was shocked that the systematic participation of party leaders 
was sought out. I feel that this is an aberration. There was 
only one which was not in the Balladur government: the Radical 
Party. That is it. It is done! We have elected an acting 
minister -- quite a nice man incidentally -- as chairman of the 
Radical Party. 
  [Jeambar] Let us get back to the presidential election, in 
other words to Edouard Balladur and Jacques Chirac. Who will 
you back? 
  [Seguin] I do not deny the legitimacy of either one. With 
widely different styles and temperaments, they have the personal 
ability to take on the supreme job. It is up to both of them to 
calm things down. This transitional phase must be managed in a 
way that is best for the interests of France alone. In 
addition, the thought needed for tomorrow and the strength of 
convictions must in no way yield to tactical concerns. In 
short, I hope that neither Mr. Balladur nor Mr. Chirac 
misunderstand what is at stake.

<F P=106> [Article by Birgitta Hammarstrom: "The Network Around Urban </F>
Backstrom" -- introductory paragraph in italics as published] 
  [Text] A dove on interest rates flirting with hawks? 
Urban Backstrom sends out conflicting signals. MANADENS AFFARER 
has mapped out the network that surrounds and influences the new 
chairman of the Bank of Sweden. 
  The hotel owner's son from Visby has sat down on the Central 
Bank throne. Nearly 2 meters tall and wearing a dark suit, he 
welcomes everyone as his guest. 
  He likes business, both theoretical and practical. That 
interest has led him to doctoral studies in both economics and 
advanced tax planning. 
  The selection of a Moderate under secretary of state to 
succeed Bengt Dennis was controversial, and the SDP [Social 
Democratic Party] registered a protest. But on the surface, he 
will become everyone's friend, probably including even the SDP 
in the long run. 
  Few people know what he is hiding under that well-pressed 
surface. Probably a happy mixture of a kid with a zest for life 
and a single-minded climber with sharp claws. 
  Politics is a belated discovery for Backstrom. It is true 
that he was student council chairman at the secondary school in 
Granna, but he was not an active member of the Moderate Party. 
Nor was he one when Georg Danell recruited him to be a 
nonpolitical member of former Moderate Party Chairman Gosta 
Bohman's staff. 
  Despite his stints with the Association of Share Investors, 
the Consensus Brokerage Firm, and the Mollberg Hotel in 
Helsingborg, it was at the Government Office that the new 
chairman of the Bank of Sweden got his training. But there was 
integrity there, and he was not regarded as a typical political 
commissar. 
  At Consensus, however, the tone was different. 
  "Backstrom was a thoroughly political CEO and favored his 
old 
buddies," says one of those who was fired. 
<H5>  Economists </H5>
  Urban Backstrom became an interest rate dove as opposed to 
the hawk Dennis following an article in EKONOMISK DEBATT. That 
earned him praise from, among others, LO [Swedish Federation of 
Trade Unions] economist Dan Anderson. Backstrom reportedly 
listens quite openly to both Anderson and his colleague P.O. 
Edin. 
  The most natural partner for dialogue in that network is 
Lars 
Jonung, professor of economics at the Stockholm School of 
Economics and economic adviser to Carl Bildt. 
  Backstrom also listens to Hans T. Soderstrom, associate 
professor of economics at the School of Economics and, since 
1985, president of the SNS (Industrial Council for Social and 
Economic Studies), and Lars Calmfors, a professor of 
international economics at Stockholm University who is active at 
the Lindbeck Institute. Ingemar Hansson, financial adviser to 
Anne Wibble in the Ministry of Finance; Lars Heikensten, senior 
economist at the Trade Bank; and Johan Myrman, professor of 
economics at the Stockholm School of Economics, are other 
heavyweights. 
  A couple of Bohman's former associates know the new chairman 
of the Bank of Sweden well: Jan Herin, senior economist at the 
SAF [Swedish Employers Confederation], and Ulf Jacobsson, senior 
economist at the Federation of Swedish Industries. 
  Ebba Lindso is also one of Backstrom's trusted friends. She 
was formerly CEO of Transferator but is now in business for 
herself and sits on a good many boards of directors. She is also 
the KDS [Christian Democratic Party] economic expert. 
<H5>  Mentors </H5>
  Lars Tobisson is party secretary and the Moderate Party's 
gray eminence. Backstrom has a lot to thank him for. Tobisson 
trained him and helped him in his career. 
  During his days in the Riksdag, Backstrom was rapporteur for 
Staffan Burenstam-Linder, then chairman of the Moderate Party's 
finance and tax committee. Burenstam-Linder, a former minister, 
is currently rector of the Stockholm School of Economics and 
chairman of the board of governors of the Bank of Sweden. He is 
probably another person that the 39-year-old chairman of the 
Bank of Sweden will turn to. Backstrom was senior economist for 
the Association of Share Investors in 1985 and 1986. In fact, he 
ran the operation together with the association's pugnacious 
managing director, Lars-Erik Forsgardh. Like Backstrom, 
Forsgardh has a background in the hotel business: He was CEO of 
the Skogsgard Hotel in Sodertalje from 1979 to 1984. Backstrom 
and Forsgardh have a great deal in common and still see each 
other. 
<H5>  Family </H5>
  His father and mother, Sven-Ake and Maj Britt Backstrom, 
first operated the main hotel in Visby and then bought the 
tradition-rich Mollberg Hotel in Helsingborg. 
  The Opera Cafe in Stockholm was the model for the Mollberg 
in 
the Backstrom era. But the style was a little more feudal. Among 
other things, it was considered desirable for the maids to 
curtsy to the owners. And thrift was the watchword at the 
Mollberg. Beer was a mixture: half new tap beer and half old 
foam from the bench under the bar. 
  Both parents thought it was great to have a son who worked 
for Gosta Bohman. 
  When Sven-Ake Backstrom fell ill, his son moved in as 
assistant manager from 1983 until 1985, when the hotel was sold. 
  Urban Backstrom tried to get the personnel to take more 
responsibility -- once he was well established. Once, for 
example, they ran out of rose wine and a waiter came to ask what 
to do. The answer was lightning quick: "Mix red and white." 
Fortunately, the boss was not always obeyed. 
  Backstrom is married to Eva, a stewardess with SAS. They 
live 
in a detached house in downtown Djursholm. They have two 
children -- Catarina, 11, and Filip, 7 -- a housemaid declared 
on their income tax return, and a dachshund named Hugo. In the 
summer they like to travel or stay in his mother-in-law's 
apartment in France. 
<H5>  Bank of Sweden </H5>
  The network at the Bank of Sweden is an unwritten chapter. 
Thomas Franzen, deputy chairman of the bank, was considered a 
dark horse. But as soon as Backstrom took over, he urged Franzen 
to stay on and accept another term when the old one expires in 
May. This despite the fact that Franzen has been largely 
responsible for formulating the Bank of Sweden's interest policy 
since the late 1980's -- the very period that Backstrom has 
criticized. 
  As these lines are being written (at the end of January), 
Backstrom is already looking for a successor to the other deputy 
chairman, Claes Norgren, the newly appointed head of the Finance 
Inspectorate. The bank's extensive international contacts make 
it necessary to have three people at the top. 
<H5>  Banking Industry </H5>
  The banking crisis gave Backstrom access to everyone in bank 
management. And he feels as comfortable with Bjorn Svedberg and 
Peter and Jacob Wallenberg at the Scandinavian Private Bank as 
he does with Hans Dahlborg and Jacob Palmstierna at the Northern 
Bank or Tom Hedelius and especially Arne Martensson from the 
Trade Bank. Naturally, the same was true with Gabriel Urwitz and 
Per Lundberg of the former Gota Bank. 
<H5>  Business World </H5>
  Backstrom has close professional contacts with Fredrik 
Lundberg, chief stockholder and CEO of Lundberg Enterprises. 
They met each other in 1990, when Lundberg's Ostgota Private 
Bank bought out Consensus. The deputy CEO at Consensus at the 
time was Urban Backstrom, and he quickly became CEO. Fredrik 
Lundberg now lives a stone's throw from Backstrom. 
  Another Lundberg man, Per Welin, deputy CEO of Lundberg 
Enterprises, was on the Consensus board of directors when 
Backstrom was CEO. 
  Arne Martensson, CEO of the Trade Bank, and Backstrom met 
each other in the fall of 1991. They have close and complicated 
contacts. Martensson was once a member of the Moderate Party's 
advisory group. 
  Another person that Backstrom esteems in the business world 
is Melker Schorling, the young and recently appointed CEO of 
Skanska who was formerly CEO of Securitas. 
  Sten Westerberg is the member of the Liberal Party who was 
under secretary of state under Gosta Bohman (Moderate Party). 
Following a banking career, he is now in business for himself. 
He is considered talented and creative, and he has lunch with 
Backstrom from time to time. In the ministry, Westerberg 
succeeded Lars Wohlin, now CEO of the City Mortgage Bank. Wohlin 
is a quick-witted man who has known Backstrom since the 
mid-1980's. 
  Olle Wastberg and Backstrom were colleagues in the Ministry 
of Finance. Wastberg's current job as editor in chief of 
EXPRESSEN makes him a valuable contact. 
<H5>  Inner Circle </H5>
  A few people outside the family are close to Backstrom. 
Minister of Taxation Bo Lundgren is one of the chosen few. He 
was also a candidate for the job of chairman of the Bank of 
Sweden but lost the struggle. Lundgren has become an 
increasingly important person to Backstrom since their days 
together in the ministry. Now the two of them meet even away 
from their jobs as time permits. They usually relax over a 
drink, sometimes at a nightclub after late meetings, and they 
play squash and badminton together. 
  Bo Lundgren's poker face conceals more humor than one might 
imagine. Like Backstrom, he was also a member of the board of 
directors of the National Debt Office and of Wine and Spirits. 
  Peter Egardt, Bildt's under secretary of state, is the man 
who gave Backstrom the most support during the years in the 
Government Office. They are good friends and meet even away from 
the job. Egardt is the pivotal figure in the government, a 
chain-smoker, and a tireless worker. His role as coordinator of 
the four coalition parties is one of today's toughest political 
jobs. 
  Another of Backstrom's guardian angels is Olof Ehrenkrona, 
planning chief for the Cabinet Office. But they are not as close 
to each other. 
  Arne Bjorhn was Backstrom's predecessor in the 
Moderate-controlled Government Office and once a very good 
friend. For a long time Bjorhn, Backstrom, and Egardt met every 
month for a so-called interest rate lunch. But after Arne 
Bjorhn's and his brother Gunnar's swindle at the Merchant Bank, 
the relationship was put on hold. (In April 1993, the Svea Court 
of Appeal sentenced Arne Bjorhn to two months in prison for 
bribery and tax evasion. His brother Gunnar received a one-year 
prison sentence for serious tax evasion and violation of the law 
on corporations. The same scandal resulted in a 1.5-year prison 
sentence for K.O. Feldt's former deputy assistant under 
secretary, Thorvald Pettersson, for tax evasion and bribery.) 
  Arne Bjorhn once helped both Backstrom and Egardt with 
extensive but legal tax planning. 
<H5>  Foreigners </H5>
  Backstrom is inheriting contacts in central bank circles 
from 
Bengt Dennis, who was chairman of the board of directors of the 
BIS (Bank for International Settlements) in Basel. 
  Hans Tietmeyer became president of the German Federal Bank 
in 
October 1993 after serving as, among other things, under 
secretary of state in the Ministry of Finance. The same career 
was followed by Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of 
France. In Italy, Antonio Fazio recently rose to become governor 
of the Bank of Italy. Fazio was previously a deputy governor, as 
was Eddie George, who has now become governor of the 
tradition-rich Bank of England. 
  Alan Greenspan, on the other hand, has been boss of the 
Federal Reserve Bank since 1987. Backstrom will have more 
dealings with the head of the Federal Reserve in New York, who 
acts as the U.S. banking system's "minister of foreign affairs." 
  In Basel, Backstrom will also meet the new BIS chief, Andrew 
Crockett from the Bank of England, and his predecessor Alexandre 
Lamfalussy. The latter is the new head of the European Monetary 
Institute, which is the embryo of the European Union's future 
central bank. 
  Backstrom will also meet such prominent economists in 
Washington as Joseph Steiglitz and Alan Blinder of Bill 
Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tirol's SPOe Leaders Resign"] </F>
  [Excerpt] On Tuesday afternoon [15 March] Hans Tanzer, 
chairman of the Tirolean Social Democratic Party [SPOe] and 
deputy provincial governor, announced his resignation during a 
meeting of the SPOe Diet group in Innsbruck. In the morning 
Walter Hengl, the second SPOe member of the Tirolean Government 
and provincial councilor for health and social matters, had 
already announced his departure from politics and had suggested 
Nationalrat deputy Walter Guggenberger as his successor. 
  Tanzer resigned from all his posts during the meeting. 
  Regarding a successor for Tanzer, the vote taken in the diet 
group between Provincial Party Secretary Herbert Prock and 
Nationalrat Deputy Walter Guggenberger led to a stalemate with 
both receiving seven votes. A definitive decision is to be made 
by the Provincial Party Executive Committee during a meeting on 
Monday evening. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Foreign Trade Deficit Risen"] </F>
  [Text] In January 1994 the deficit in the Austrian trade 
balance increased by 70.9 percent to 2.932 billion schillings 
compared with the previous months, the Central Statistical 
Office reports. 
  With an increase of 10.6 percent to 41.609 billion 
schillings, imports rose far more strongly than exports, which 
went up by only 3.1 percent to 34.539 billion. However, the 
month under review had one work day more than January 1993. 
  Higher imports are registered primarily from the FRG (up 6.7 
percent), Italy (up 16.8 percent), France (up 14.3 percent), the 
Netherlands (up 16.2 percent), Sweden (up 23.2 percent), and the 
United States (up 28.8 percent). Imports from the Czech 
Republic (up 41.5 percent) and Russia (up 27.9 percent) have 
also gone up. An increase was registered in Austrian exports to 
France (14 percent), Spain (29 percent), Slovenia (10.8 
percent), Hungary (20 percent), the United States (35.8 
percent), and Switzerland (11 percent). 
  In January imports decreased only for fuels and energy (down 
2.1 percent), while all other important groups of goods 
experienced increases, in some cases even double-digit growth 
rates. In exports there were losses concerning processed goods 
(down 1.2 percent) and durable consumer goods (down 3.3 percent; 
clothes, furniture, musical instruments). Exports of raw 
materials (16.4 percent) and chemical products (12.3 percent) 
showed an increase.

<F P=106> [Report by Hans V. Haumer: "OeMV: Great Prospects, High </F>
Risks"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Within the framework of international 
consortia, the OeMV [Austrian Petroleum Corporation] currently 
is examining two projects that might yield much but which are, 
at the same time, fraught with high political risks. The 
construction of a gas pipeline to Europe is being discussed with 
Iran and Turkey. 
  In Libya, on the other hand, the issue is participation in 
the gigantic Murzuk oil field, which contains more than 110 
million tonnes, according to the OeMV. The technical journal 
ARAB OIL &amp; GAS reports on estimates of up to 280 million 
tonnes. 
  The Iranian gas pipeline project is supported by the rising 
demand for natural gas in Europe. In the year 2000 West Europe 
will face a deficit of 33 billion cubic meters, according to 
today's (changeable) state of affairs. 
  The proposal that is being discussed involves an annual 
supply capacity of 5 billion cubic meters. In addition to the 
National Iranian Gas Corporation, the consortium also includes 
Gaz de France, Ruhrgas, the Spanish Enagas, the Czech and Slovak 
corporations, as well as the OeMV. 
  Iran currently produces about 110 million cubic meters per 
day. Its own consumption in the 1993-94 business year will 
probably be 38.9 billion cubic meters. 
  The economic and political framework presents a problem. 
Tensions between Iran and Turkey have risen strongly over the 
past months -- to such an extent that troops have been 
transferred to the joint border. 
  The problems arise, on the one hand, because of the Central 
Asian area (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan), where both countries want 
to expand their influence. On the other hand, the conflicts of 
the Turkish state with its Kurdish minority are far from being 
settled. 
<H5>  Libyan Hopes </H5>
  In the Libyan Sahara the OeMV might expand its own oil 
production considerably. As of 1997-98 7.5 to 8 million tonnes 
of oil per year could be produced from the Murzuk field. The 
Libyan National Oil Corporation [LNOC] is looking for 
international partners and is holding discussions with a 
consortium. 
  This consortium consists of the French company Total, which 
is the leader of the consortium, holding 40 percent. The OeMV 
and the Spanish Repsol Exploracion hold 30 percent each. 
Experts of this industrial branch estimate the consortium's 
capital need for the entire project at 6 billion schillings. 
  However, what benefits the investors at first glance also 
makes their involvement more difficult. Libya cannot make any 
great demands. The UN embargo is becoming tighter and tighter. 
  Airlines may no longer fly to the country. Some months ago a 
ban on capital transfers to Libya by all companies with a Libyan 
majority was added. Equipment for oil terminals and refineries 
is also subject to the embargo. 
  As a final escalation of trade barriers, the United States 
is 
threatening an oil embargo. This would mean that foreign 
(European) oil corporations could no longer sell the oil they 
are producing in Libya. In contrast to the European 
corporations, U.S. corporations have not been active in Libya 
since they were thrown out in the 1980's and because of the 
permanent conflicts between the United States and Libya.

<F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>
  [Text] The Government tonight insisted it had no plans to 
test nuclear weapons following the United States' announcement 
of an 18-month extension to its testing moratorium until 
September, 1995. 
  President Bill Clinton's decision was based in part on the 
restraint other nuclear powers have shown in resisting pressure 
to resume testing in response to China's test last October. 
  White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Mr Clinton was 
concerned about the impact resumed U.S. nuclear tests would have 
on comprehensive ban talks which opened in January. 
  Britain, which has traditionally relied on testing its 
nuclear warheads in the Nevada Desert, said the moratorium 
extension was not unexpected. 
  "We reaffirm we have no intention of testing while the 
United 
States' moratorium continues," said a Foreign Office spokesman. 
  "And we would also reaffirm our commitment to working with 
energy and speed towards the completion of an effective nuclear 
test ban treaty." 
  When President Clinton first slapped a ban on nuclear 
testing in 1992, Britain fiercely resisted the move as three 
tests were planned on Trident warheads "for safety reasons." 
  But the Government has reluctantly accepted that world 
opinion is set against testing and is striving to develop 
computer modelling to simulate the effect of nuclear blasts. 
  The need for testing in any case has eased after the 
Government's decision to scrap plans for a new sub-strategic 
nuclear missile. 
  Instead, Britain is to use a number of Trident missiles 
fitted with single warheads. 
  Thus it is not necessary to develop a new warhead as all the 
Trident missiles -- both strategic and sub-strategic -- will be 
fitted with the same warhead. 
  However, Britain is retaining its capability to design, 
develop and produce new nuclear weapons in the future.

  [Text] Britain needs to ensure "democratic legitimacy and 
the rights of minorities" are sustained in today's negotiations 
on enlarging the European Union [EU], the Prime Minister 
declared. 
  He told the Commons at question time that Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd would be seeking to do this in the Brussels talks 
on the terms for Finland, Sweden, Austria and Norway to join the 
EU. 
  Against a background of some Tory Euro-sceptics threatening 
a 
Maastricht-scale revolt if Mr Hurd agrees to voting changes 
reducing the UK's ability to block unwanted proposals, Mr Major 
said the Government attached "great importance" to qualified 
majority voting by EU member states. 
  He was responding to Dr Liam Fox, Tory MP for Woodspring, 
who 
called for an assurance "it is the protection of British 
interests in Europe which will lie at the heart of our position 
in the current negotiations." 
  The Prime Minister said: "It is important that this country 
plays a full part in the European Community and exercises its 
influence both on behalf of people in this country and on behalf 
of Europe as a whole." 
  The UK was "very much in favour" of EU enlargement and 
negotiations were very nearly complete, he added. 
  "The present discussions between the 12 are about the 
institutional changes that will accompany the enlargement. 
  ``Like many other states, we attach importance to qualified 
majority voting. But I think it is right to consider very 
carefully the effect upon [word indistinct] of an increase in 
membership. 
  ``What we need to ensure is that democratic legitimacy and 
the rights of minorities are sustained within the EU. 
  ``That is what Mr Hurd will be seeking to do in his 
negotiations.'' 
  The dispute concerns a proposal that, to take account of the 
forthcoming accession of Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway to 
the EU, the number of votes that must be secured to block EU 
legislation be raised from 23 to 27. 
  The British Government currently needs backing only from one 
other large member state and one small one effectively to veto 
EU proposals.

  [Text] A party of Ulster Unionists is to visit America next 
month for talks with State Department officials and politicians. 
  Party leader James Molyneaux is heading a delegation which 
will visit New York and Washington. 
  The party said there was a particular need to counter 
attempts by the republican support group Noraid and other 
elements to undermine business and industrial interest in 
Northern Ireland. 
  A statement from the party said a series of routine visits 
by 
senior party members had helped to "offset the problems being 
caused by a small but vociferous minority within the 
Irish-American community." 
  Fermanagh-South Tyrone MP Mr Ken Maginnis, Euro MP Mr Jim 
Nicholson and party secretary Jeffrey Donaldson leave with Mr 
Molyneaux on April 16. 
  Last month Mr Molyneaux refused to accept an invitation to 
address a New York conference attended by the Sinn Fein 
president Gerry Adams. 
  The party statement added: "Mr Molyneaux believes this is an 
appropriate time to reinforce relationships on a broader front 
and has been encouraged by the number of invitations to 
undertake a more formal visit at this time."

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In light of altered international 
conditions, the Bundeswehr should expand its ability to take 
part in the resolution of international crises. The armed 
forces are least prepared for these tasks at present, Federal 
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said today after the cabinet 
approved the Bundeswehr 1994 White Paper in Bonn. 
  Germany needs a minimum contigent "of available, quickly 
deployable and transferable crisis reaction forces with a high 
degree of professionalism," which were capable of multinational 
cooperation. 
  At the same time the armed forces for national defense 
should 
be "scaled down both in numbers and in their readiness for 
deployment and be made more responsive to mobilization." 
According to Ruehe, nothing will be changed with regard to 
conscription. It remains a constituent element of the 
Bundeswehr.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trend Away From Popular Parties </F>
Checked"] 
  [Text] Election year 1994 has begun with success for the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens, and 
defeat for the Bonn coalition parties the Christian Democratic 
Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. In the Landtag 
elections in Lower Saxony on Sunday [13 March], the SPD and the 
Greens obtained an absolute majority of seats. The Greens, who 
had been in government with the SPD until now, were also able to 
improve their results significantly. By contrast, the CDU 
suffered heavy losses and had to make do with the worst results 
in 35 years. The FDP will no longer not be represented in the 
Landtag. The protest parties received well below 5 percent. The 
Mannheim-based "Research Group Elections" arrived at the 
following conclusions: 
  "Few voters (22 percent) in Lower Saxony expected an 
absolute 
majority for the SPD, and only 37 percent wanted the SPD to 
achieve an absolute majority. Even among SPD supporters, over a 
third did not want the party to have an absolute majority. 
Nevertheless, the Lower Saxony results represent an end to the 
trend away from the popular parties, which was in evidence since 
the last elections. The SPD and the CDU were able to win the 
backing of 80 percent of the electorate. That is somewhat less 
than four years ago, but significantly more than in the 
elections in Hamburg in September of last year, when the SPD and 
CDU jointly were only able to obtain 65 percent. Despite 
hurricane-like weather conditions, the turnout was still high at 
73.8 percent. 
  ``The Lower Saxony elections drew attention to the current 
political situation at the federal level. The CDU and the FDP 
felt that above all. The CDU, which on scale of between - 5 
and + 5 still achieved an average level of + 1.3 in Lower 
Saxony four years ago, now only obtained + 0.3, and the FDP, 
which scored + 0.7 percent four years ago, now only achieved 
- 0.3. However, the SPD's image also registered a drop from 
+ 1.7 at the last elections to + 1.4 in these elections. Only 
the Greens registered an improvement, from - 0.6 to - 0.1 now. 
  ``In view of the position at the outset, the room for 
political maneuver at the land level was limited for Lower 
Saxony's parties. Both the SPD and the CDU were able to profit 
from the relatively high standing of their leading politicians. 
Thus, Minister-President Schroeder scored an average of + 1.4 
on a scale of between - 5 and + 5 among all the citizens of 
Lower Saxony and + 2.8 among SPD supporters, faring only 
marginally better than his challenger Christian Wulff, who 
obtained + 1.2 among all those polled and + 2.7 among all CDU 
voters. However, asked to make a direct comparison, 47 percent 
of all the citizens of Lower Saxony would want to see Schroeder 
as minister-president, and only 33 percent opted for Wulff. 
  ``What was also decisive for the SPD result was that the 
party succeed in gaining the support of the bulk of its 1990 
voters: As many as 77 percent of SPD voters this time had also 
voted for the party the last time, 8 percent came over directly 
from the CDU, and almost every tenth one came from the group of 
those who were not eligible to vote last time or did not vote. 
Among its classic regular voters, that is, unionized workers, 
it could almost gather two-thirds of all votes. 
  ``Despite its losses, the CDU was also successful in its 
traditional areas: In its strongholds, it suffered below 
average losses in view of its strong position at the outset. 
Among the Catholics in the countryside, it obtained 55 percent. 
In the countryside as a whole, it achieved 47 percent, and 48 
percent among the over-sixties, one of its strongest sources of 
support. The losses among all social structure subgroups were 
roughly similar. 
  ``The federal political climate was not the only factor 
determining the failure of the FDP. The work of the FDP as an 
opposition force in the Lower Saxony Landtag was also assessed 
negatively. The FDP's attitude toward the coalition question 
also had an effect. Before the elections, FDP voters wanted a 
clear answer to the question of with whom would the FDP want to 
govern after the elections. Neither in Lower Saxony nor at the 
federal level do FDP's regular voters suffice for the party to 
cross the 5-percent threshold.'' 
<H5>  Clear Gains for the Greens </H5>
  ``The Greens were the only party that made clear gains and 
obtained its best result in these Lower Saxony Landtag 
elections, also faring well among voters in the 18-25 age group 
(17 percent) on this occasion at the expense of the SPD, but 
achieving lower results among the 25-34 age group (13 percent). 
By contrast, the SPD was able to maintain its 1990 result among 
the latter group. The Greens were able to obtain their best 
result among young women below the age of 24, gaining 19 percent 
of the vote. 
  ``The fact that the Republikaner results were well below the 
5-percent mark was due to the loss in importance of their key 
issue, the asylum and foreigners question, which is only ranked 
among problems of major importance for the land by 10 percent of 
the inhabitants of Lower Saxony and, on the other hand, to 
increased competence of the popular parties on important 
political questions. The agreement that was reached on nursing 
attendance insurance was undoubtedly a signal in this respect. 
  ``On the question of solving the most important issues in 
the 
land, a land government led by the SPD undoubtedly has an 
advantage over one led by the CDU. In the case of unemployment, 
which is considered the most important issue in the land by 68 
percent of the inhabitants of Lower Saxony, 28 percent believe 
that an SPD government would be better at solving the problem 
and only 14 percent would be more inclined to have confidence in 
a CDU government, but 30 percent of the citizens in Lower Saxony 
consider both parties to be equally capable of solving the 
problem, whereas only 22 percent think that neither party can 
solve the problem. On the issue of the economy too, there is 
more confidence in the SPD in Lower Saxony (27 percent) than in 
the CDU (21 percent), although in this case too, most (28 
believe) that both an SPD-led and CDU-led government could solve 
economic problems and only 17 percent think that neither party 
is capable of doing so. Overall, there is significantly more 
confidence in the ability of the two largest parties to solve 
problems than a few months ago.''

<F P=106> [Report by Christiane Goetz: "The Most Expensive Scrap of </F>
the GDR"] 
  [Text] A total of 1.5 million German marks [DM] per day -- 
this is how much the German taxpayer has to pay for the heritage 
of the GDR's National People's Army (NVA). Norbert Holla, 
spokesman for the Armament Section in the Defense Ministry, told 
FOCUS that this is the sum needed for guarding, destroying, and 
disposing of old NVA weapons and equipment. 
  In 1993, scrapping GDR war materiel cost DM290 million, this 
year it will cost DM530 million. To meet the timetable for 
getting rid of the materiel, ever higher sums from the defense 
budget have to be spent on the elimination of the NVA heritage. 
By the end of 1995, the legacy of the GDR Army should be 
dissolved completely. 
  Yet, some experts regard this timetable as utopian. "We will 
have to struggle with this problem for several more decades," 
predicts Hans-Joachim Schmidt, arms control expert of the Hesse 
Peace and Conflict Research Foundation. Enormous amounts of 
poisonous military scrap and ammunition are still buried in the 
new laender. The deputy chairman of the Defense Committee in 
the German Bundestag, Heinz-Alfred Steiner, of the Social 
Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], has even claimed that "NVA 
materiel is still straying in the Bundeswehr." So far the 
stocktaking of the remains of the GDR Army, which was beaten 
without combat, has not even been concluded. 
  Vera Wollenberger, defense policy spokeswoman for the 
Alliance 90/Greens, also suspects a huge looming "cost 
avalanche." The lady from Thuringia refers to her information 
as a member of the defense committee of the last GDR People's 
Chamber: Based on detailed calculations regarding the 
dissolution of the NVA, the committee assumed that the scrapping 
of the ammunition alone would take at least 10 years. 
  Any delay increases the cost even further: While prices for 
the technologically expensive disposal are rising, the arms 
arsenals have to be guarded at great cost. No fewer than 1,500 
guards are needed, because the facilities at which the 
ammunition and arms have been concentrated are regarded as 
bearing an extreme security risk. The positive side: The 11 
facilities in the new laender, where the enormous amounts of 
ammunition are being scrapped, have at least provided 2,000 safe 
jobs -- which, for Walter Kolbow, the Social Democratic Party of 
Germany [SPD] defense policy spokesman, constitutes a "major 
job-creation program" that actually should not be funded from 
the defense budget. 
  All in all, scrapping and guarding NVA arms and ammunition 
has cost DM900 million since unification -- and the billion-mark 
threshold will be exceeded by the end of the year. The hopes 
that one could even make money from the GDR legacy have not been 
fulfilled: Not more than one-third of the expenses have been 
returned so far to the state's pocket through the sale of 
individual units of equipment and contracts at government level. 
  Still, it is not only NATO countries that have been among 
the 
recipient countries: A total of 39 ships went to Indonesia at a 
time when international organizations complained about human 
rights violations in East Timor. 
  According to Gerald Rotter of the Federal Office for 
Armament 
Technology and Procurement in Koblenz, ammunition has also been 
shipped to Indonesia, as well as to Finland and Sweden. Tankers 
were sold to Kuwait and Egypt, while trucks were even sold to 
Vietnam and Ecuador. 
  Experts suspect that, via dealers, stocks even reached the 
international arms trade -- thus reaching conflict areas such as 
Bosnia. According to former Minister Christian 
Schwarz-Schilling (CDU) [Christian Democratic Union], the 
civil-war-stricken area in the Balkans would at least be a 
rewarding destination for arms supplies. "Instead of destroying 
them here at enormous cost, using them there would at least make 
sense." 
  The Bundeswehr received a total of 150 ships, including 90 
larger ones, from NVA stocks. Selected vessels went to the 
Verwertungsgesellschaft fuer Besatzungsgueter mbH (Vebeg) 
[Exploitation Corporation for Military Equipment] in 
Frankfurt/Main, which sells off discarded NVA and Bundeswehr 
materiel on behalf of the Federal Government. 
  The Vebeg, meanwhile, has been able to sell most of its Navy 
and Air Force stocks. Long-distance aircraft provided the 
highest return -- up to DM1.5 million per unit. Three went to 
Egypt, three were bought by a German businessman who managed to 
resell one in Russia, and one was given away to Estonia (which 
is said to have led to irritation with Russia). Some 50 combat 
aircraft of the former GDR were donated to German museums. 
  Of the more than 60,000 NVA vehicles, from Trabant cars to 
large Russian vehicles, Vebeg has sold about 33,000 in the past 
three years. One major item went to the United Nations as 
humanitarian aid. 
  In Germany, Vebeg mainly sold motorcycles and passenger 
cars, 
mostly to small businesses and farmers. Yet, a total of 6,000 
vehicles could only be sold at scrap value. Another 15,000 cars 
are still stored in seven facilities in eastern Germany where 
they can be bought at auctions. 
  More than 110,000 tonnes of the 300,000 tonnes of ammunition 
that have so far been found still have to be disposed of. Most 
large-caliber stuff has meanwhile been almost completely 
destroyed: Hartmut Krone, manager of the Buckinpar GmbH in 
Pinnow (Brandenburg), has said that his company will complete 
the scrapping of all NVA missiles -- 360,000 units altogether -- 
by May. 
  The deputy chairman of the Bundestag Defense Committee, 
Steiner, has meanwhile called for "conceptual restructuring." 
To speed up the dissolution, entire stocks should be sold in 
the future in "one package." Karsten Voigt, security policy 
spokesman for the SPD, however, would prefer that arms exports 
be stopped altogether in the future: "I would rather scrap 
everything, even if it were to cost more."

<F P=106> ["vwd" report: "Employment Climate in the East Receives </F>
Dampener"] 
  [Text] Halle, 14 Mar -- The slight improvement in the 
climate on the first labor market of the new laender in 1993 
received a dampener in December 1993 and experienced a tangible 
setback in January 1994. This is stated in a study by the 
Economics Research Institute (IWH), Halle/Saale. During these 
two months the climate index went down by 1 percentage point as 
a whole -- 0.7 percent of that in January. Only 70.3 percent of 
all east Germans able and willing to work were employed on the 
first labor market at the beginning of 1994. 
  In contrast, 29.7 percent were either completely without a 
job, were working as a result of measures to ease the burden on 
the labor market, or commuted to a job outside the new laender. 
According to the IWH, the cooling of the employment climate is 
most strongly expressed in the way the number of registered 
unemployed has soared to 1.293 million (plus 118,000). The last 
time the unemployment figure was that high was in early 1992. 
The renewed increase is mainly an indication of the persistent 
imbalance between the creation of new jobs and the continuing 
job cuts. 
  However, the increase in unemployment is not just a 
reflection of the effects of the structural crisis in the east. 
It also expresses the withdrawal of labor market policy. 
Whereas in January 1993, 100 jobless were offset by 142 cases 
of promotion measures, in the same month of 1994 there were only 
about 100 such cases. The effect of the abating labor market 
policy thus corresponded to almost one-third of registered 
unemployed. Nevertheless, job-creation measures saved about 
223,000 from complete unemployment in January 1994. In December 
there were almost 7,000 fewer east Germans on short-time than 
during the same month the previous year, and in January there 
were about 10,000 fewer. 
  In January 1994 the number of people on short-time fell to 
the lowest level so far -- 116,000. The number who took the 
opportunity of further training and retraining was 279,000 and 
was thus also lower. In total, in January 1994 almost 1.3 
million east Germans -- including recipients of old-age 
transition allowance and those in early retirement -- were saved 
from complete unemployment by labor market policy. A year ago 
there were 1.7 million.

assessment of the wage settlements by the Labor Ministry. 
  Yet there are considerable differences between eastern and

the weekly working hours: In the west, the average was 37.76 
hours, and in the east over two hours more. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Radioactive Uranium </F>
Waste Threatens New Laender"] 
  [Text] Berlin -- According to the Ecological Institute in 
Darmstadt, hundreds of thousands of people in southern Saxony 
and Thuringia are subjected to dangerous radiation from the 
waste of GDR uranium mining. A study which was published 
yesterday shows that more than 1 billion tonnes of contaminated 
radioactive waste would have to be safely disposed. 
  The wastes, which contain radium, constantly release radon. 
This leads to about six deaths from radiation per year just in 
the east Thuringian area of Ronneburg, radiation biologist 
Gerhard Schmidt from Darmstadt says. He called on the Federal 
Government to quickly fulfill its legal duty to dispose of the 
waste, because otherwise there would be unjustifiable long-term 
effects. 
  According to the institute, there have been 5,000 
job-related 
deaths at the Wismut corporation since uranium mining began in 
1945. Over a 40-year period the Soviet Union mined about 
220,000 tonnes of uranium from the ore in the south of the 
former GDR as basic material for its military and civilian 
nuclear program. According to estimates by the Darmstadt 
institute, defusing the environmental bomb will cost far more 
than the 15 billion German marks so far assumed.

<F P=106> ["ky"-signed commentary: "Consultation Instead of </F>
Confrontation"] 
  [Text] Former president Richard Nixon has been accused of 
various things in the past, but not of being a foreign policy 
amateur. During his recent private visit to Moscow, the 
81-year-old proved once again he still has great knowledge of 
world politics. At the end of his visit he came to the 
conclusion that Russia will remain a great power whose interests 
will, however, not always be identical with those of the United 
States. 
  This realization may sound very simple, but it was far from 
obvious over the past few weeks: The Ames espionage affair and 
Moscow's latest diplomatic initiative in Bosnia and the Middle 
East almost recreated the image of the aggressive Russian bear 
as the United States' more or less natural opponent. It is, 
therefore, all the more surprising -- and encouraging -- that 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has now come to the same 
conclusion as Richard Nixon: Following his meeting with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Christopher stated that 
differences between Moscow and Washington are quite natural. 
They just have to be solved as soon as they arise. 
  In Vladivostok, the Russians once again emphasized what is 
important to them. They want to be consulted, not taken by 
surprise by U.S. initiatives. This complaint contains the 
threat of starting their own initiatives that have not been 
agreed beforehand. This would mean a relapse into the Cold War. 
As long as Russia emphasizes its interest in a constructive 
partnership, it should be taken at its word.

<F P=106> ["W.A." commentary: "Superpower Pretensions"] </F>
  [Text] When Gorbachev was canvassing for perestroyka, he 
substantiated it by saying that the Soviet Union will sooner or 
later lose its international weight without an economic 
foundation. But Russia, as the central country of the destroyed 
Eastern empire, does not want to hear of this; it ignores 
almost stubbornly such an insight. Although the economic 
situation is even worse than in Soviet times, Moscow is 
insisting more resolutely than ever on a leading role in world 
politics. Only the United States is recognized as an equal 
power. "Strategic partnership" is the slogan that Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev enjoined to his U.S. counterpart, 
Christopher, in Vladivostok on Monday [14 March] in a way that 
was as self-confident as it was demanding. 
  However, it was not necessary for Kozyrev particularly to 
press the U.S. secretary of state, who had been treated in a 
humiliating way in Beijing the day before. According to 
Christopher, Washington, which copes with the Chinese only with 
difficulty in the political field, is now seeking all the more 
"harmonious cooperation" with the Russians. From the West's 
point of view, against the background of the numerous regional 
conflicts, there are certainly many arguments in favor of 
involving the Russians in the effort to check the trouble spots 
and to use the former Soviet influence in certain areas of the 
world. However, the impression that in this troubled world 
nothing works any longer without its participation was not 
supposed to be conveyed to the Russian leadership. However, 
Kozyrev seems to be convinced of exactly that, because otherwise 
it cannot be explained why he is meanwhile demanding from the 
United States closer coordination on virtually every 
international issue. 
  Since the West helped the Kremlin gain new influence in the 
Balkans, there is no holding Moscow's diplomacy any longer. 
Only a few days ago, Russia also returned to the Middle East 
stage when, without being invited, the active Kozyrev declared 
himself mediator between Israel and the PLO. If the power of 
veto in relations between East and Central Europe and the West 
is added, the West should actually ask itself whether this can 
be the purpose of a strategic partnership with Russia.

<F P=106> [Jens Schneider commentary: "The Most Difficult Task Still </F>
Lies Ahead"] 
  [Text] In Vienna, Croats and Muslims have agreed on a 
federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In Sarajevo, Muslims and 
Serbs have agreed on reopening three important access roads and 
the strategically important bridge of brotherhood and unity -- 
which could mean the end of the siege. In Herzegovina's 
capital, Mostar, Muslims and Croats have stopped shooting at one 
another; in the Muslim ghetto in the eastern part of the city 
people can once again move about freely. 
  For two years we could only report bad news from Bosnia, 
until, in early February, following the massacre in the 
marketplace, NATO issued an ultimatum to the Serbs around 
Sarajevo. Since then, things seem to have started developing in 
a completely new direction. It is still too early to talk about 
lasting peace -- there is still heavy fighting going on around 
Maglaj and Bihac. But chances that the war could come to an end 
are better than ever before. This is not only confirmed by the 
latest reports from the Balkans. Something else inspires 
confidence: For the first time, there are mediators involved 
whose voices carry weight with the warring parties, while those 
whom nobody would have believed any more moved into the 
background. 
  American mediator Charles Redman and Russian special envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin have taken on the role of strategists -- 
representing their governments. One must remember that they 
have levers at their disposal that Lord Owen and his mediator 
colleague Thorvald Stoltenberg never had. And this is the only 
reason that the Americans could mediate the federation agreement 
between Croats and Muslims. Both sides had something to lose: 
Zagreb had to be afraid of sanctions, and the Bosnian 
Government knows that it depends on the Americans' support. 
  The relationship between Belgrade and Moscow runs along 
similar lines: The Serbs see Russia as their only potential 
patron and thus have to follow the demands of the Russian 
Government. Belgrade has to accept that Moscow is not pursuing 
pro-Serbian policies mainly in the sense of a Slav brotherhood, 
but that it wants to mediate peace. 
  What is the progress so far worth? The agreement between 
Croats and Muslims is comprehensive, and it tries to regulate 
life in the common federation almost down to the rotation 
principle for the village mayors. But this does not mean much. 
Earlier plans had laid down grand principles too; refugees were 
to be allowed to return to their homes, the results of "ethnic 
cleansing" were not to be accepted. The problem was that nobody 
wanted to keep these principles. What is important is that both 
sides will have to take things seriously this time -- because 
they will feel American pressure. If this pressure eased off, 
their enthusiasm for peace could die down very quickly. 
  Also, this pact can be an interim solution at best, because 
none of the major issues have so far been at the center of 
negotiations. The issue of distribution of territories made all 
earlier mediations fail. In Vienna it was agreed that the 
federation is to make up 60 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Considering the share of the Muslim and Croat populations in 
Bosnia, this would be a just solution. But: The Serbs would have 
to give up part of their captured territories. 
  This means that the most difficult task still lies ahead of 
Churkin and Redman. They will have to get the Serbs to 
participate in the talks on possible solutions as quickly as 
possible. In doing this, they will once again have to use 
pressure. It has already been signalled to Belgrade that it has 
a clear choice: Either it gets the Bosnian Serbs to compromise, 
or it will remain isolated in the long run.

<F P=106> [Carl Gustav Stroehm commentary: "Hope for Bosnia"] </F>
  [Text] Under U.S. aegis the Bosnian Muslims and the 
Bosnian Croats have made a breakthrough: A constitution for a 
federation in Bosnia seems to have been set down. The country 
will be formed of cantons with Muslim and Croatian majorities 
respectively. The office of the head of state is to alternate 
annually between a Muslim and a Croat. 
  However, the problem lies in the details: Everything now 
depends on whether the Muslims and the Croats really do 
cooperate -- or whether the former are just waiting to 
outmaneuver the latter, and the latter, for their part, see the 
Bosnian solution just as an interim step toward joining the 
Republic of Croatia. 
  The biggest factor of uncertainty are the Serbs. The U.S. 
hopes that the Serbs will participate in the Bosnian federation. 
However, there is the danger that including them might blow up 
the building. The Serbs do not want Bosnia -- they want a 
Greater Serbia. 
  If the bilateral Muslim-Croat federation comes about, then 
something like a new Yalta line will be drawn between the Serbs 
on the one hand and the Muslims and Croats on the other. 
Whatever is on the western side of the line is influenced by 
NATO and the European Union. Whatever is to the east of it -- 
that is, Serbia and the territories conquered by the Serbs -- 
will be under Russian protection. 
  The Croats and the Muslims derive one satisfaction from all 
this: This time they are on the "western side." The first World 
Bank loan of $700 million has already been prepared for Croatia.

  [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur said Wednesday [16 March] that the European 
Union's [EU] differences over voting rights for new EU members 
should not penalize new EU members such as Sweden. 
  Speaking at a dinner in honour of Sweden's King Karl XVI 
Gustav, Balladur said Paris would continue to work "towards 
finding acceptable solutions" to the problems over voting rights 
in an enlarged EU. 
  He was referring in particular to British refusal to give 
way 
in a row over how to change the voting rules in ministerial 
councils -- the EU's main decision-making organs -- to take 
account of the four new members. 
  Balladur conceded that the agreement signed on March 1 
setting out the terms of Sweden's admission to the Union "like 
all agreements, is not perfect." But he insisted it was "good 
for the Union and for Sweden." 
  The French prime minister added that economic relations 
between France and Sweden should not be tainted by the "failure" 
of the merger between carmakers Renault and Volvo. 
  He said the joint venture, which broke down earlier this 
year, "could have been a good adventure." 
  Sweden is applying for membership along with Norway, Finland 
and Austria. If all four countries join the Union would be 
boosted to 16 members, possibly as early as the start of next 
year. 
  Earlier Wednesday, some 20 leading Swedish businessmen, 
accompanied by the king, met their French counterparts at the 
National Council of French Employers. 
  The two groups discussed boosting cooperation, reinforcing 
European competitiveness and the economic situation in Sweden, 
Council officials told a press conference.

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Quatremer: "France, Seeming To Pull Back </F>
From the Union"] 
  [Text] Brussels (European Union) -- Is there a pilot at 
the controls of France's European policy? Judging by the way in 
which it is managing the expansion of the European Union [EU], 
there is reason to doubt it. While the Twelve have been in 
confrontation for several weeks -- the discussions are resuming 
in Brussels today -- on the balance of power within a Union of 
15 or 16 states, France has remained strangely withdrawn. It is 
only saying that it wants to ensure that the decisionmaking 
process within the Council of Ministers is not made more 
difficult by the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden and, 
if the negotiations are successful, Norway. In the context of 
expansion, what is at stake is the Union's institutions and 
hence "Europe's capacity to make effective decisions and be a 
power," as someone close to the Elysee [presidential office] 
remarked. However: "We do not know what is desired," the 
diplomats responsible for implementing France's European policy 
say almost unanimously. Does it want a more federal Europe? A 
Europe with variable geometry? A Europe welcoming all the 
countries of Eastern Europe? Or a diluted Europe without any 
real capacity for initiative? 
  France which, just a short time ago, set the tone for 
European construction together with Germany, seems to have 
abdicated in favor of Bonn and London, which have made an 
unambiguous choice in favor of expansion even if it is at the 
expense of the deepening of the Union. "It is difficult to 
discern France's ambition, its grand design," a Benelux diplomat 
noted with despair. "We have the impression that it is trying 
to reap short-term successes, which are considerable but 
isolated, like GATT or the former Yugoslavia." 
  This French "absence" is due to several factors. First, it 
is clear that "these short-term successes were achieved at the 
expense of fundamental concessions," a senior French official 
asserted. The Germans are now demanding the price of their 
support during the monetary crises or in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations. Second, "it is as if the ratification of 
Maastricht had not been overcome," one diplomat said. 
  Finally, the 1995 presidential election makes any overly 
clear assertion of a European policy potentially explosive both 
within the Majority and between the Elysee and the Hotel 
Matignon [prime minister's office]. Last fall's episode is 
revealing in this respect. Alain Juppe, the head of French 
diplomacy, being aware of the dangers of expansion without 
deepening, had suggested to his European partners a revival of 
the institutional debate. But, without warning anybody, 
Francois Mitterrand, on an official visit to Vienna on 7 
October, ruled out any reform. "This situation is likely to tip 
France into the British camp -- blocking for fear of moving," a 
Benelux diplomat said with regret. Here too, virtually the same 
situation is found in the vast majority of EU countries 
(especially Germany, Britain, and Italy) where politically 
weakened governments form a veritable "assembly of cripples," to 
cite one diplomat. 
  The French paralysis also stems from the weakness of the 
Franco-German axis. The German Government, in the throes of a 
difficult election year, is playing its own game within the 
Union: Expansion is one indication of this, but so is the German 
ambiguity on Economic and Monetary Union. However, as 
Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French European deputy (European 
People's Party-Union for French Democracy), remarks, "there can 
be no vision of Europe without a fundamental agreement between 
the French and Germans." 
  In short, this French refusal to make choices, whatever good 
reasons are invoked, is bound to accentuate the "swing in the 
British direction," in other words the Union's march toward a 
simple free trade area without any capacity for action. Unless 
of course some people, especially in Paris, find that this 
serves their purpose?

of seven species of fish are to be extended by two months, the 
French Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries said Wednesday [16

the 
political accord reached overnight which will extend for two 
months the arrangements put in place at France's request." 
  "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that 
the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of 
minimum import prices," the statement said, quoting Agriculture 
and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech. 
  On Tuesday in Brussels, a spokesman for the European 
Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the system would not be 
extended as there were no data showing that the market is 
destabilized at present by cheap fish imports. 
  The spokesman added however that if such data were 
forthcoming, the commission "is prepared to re-establish the 
minimum prices." 
  The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire 
March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against 
excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set 
for fish last year as well, from February to December. 
  France asked the commission to extend the minimum prices 
last 
week. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes 
violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU 
countries that drive down prices of French fish. 
  The ministry added in its statement Wednesday that: "Our 
firmness has paid off. The European Union now has two months to 
take a serious look at the difficulties in the fishing sector."

<F P=106> [Article by Philippe Reinhard: "A Pretext"] </F>
  [Text] The primaries will probably never take place. They 
contradict our country's electoral customs and habits. Moreover, 
they are totally incompatible with the spirit of our 
institutions. The president of the Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) is thus not wrong in reminding us that the true 
"primaries" are, in reality, the first round of the presidential 
elections. However, Valery Giscard d'Estaing would be more 
convincing if he had not accepted the principle himself. Like 
all leaders of the Right, he signed the 12 June 1991 agreement 
on the primaries. To say at present that one refuses to honor a 
promise would give a bad image of the credibility of political 
leaders. 
  Ever since Charles Pasqua invented the "primaries 
French-style," all the bosses of the Right--or almost all--have 
said everything and anything on this issue. With the exception 
of the minister of interior himself and of Gerard Longuet, who 
have been constant partisans of this system, as well as Raymond 
Barre, who never hid his hostility to it, all have changed their 
opinion according to circumstances and polls. These about-faces 
are not meant to improve the image of political leaders, but 
they are understandable. Even those who adhered at one time or 
another to this idea never really believed in it. In the mind of 
most of them, the primaries have only been a pretext for subtle 
maneuvers, generally aimed at weakening the adversary. 
  Charles Pasqua's present initiative cannot be interpreted 
differently. There is little probability that the minister of 
interior thinks it is possible to carry out his project. Even if 
the prime minister accepted the submission to Parliament of a 
text authorizing the organization of primaries, and supposing 
that such a law were declared constitutional, it is not certain 
that deputies will approve it. The majority of the UDF does not 
favor it, and Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic (RPR) 
deputies are showing a lot of reserve, to say the least. 
Finally, even if this bill were submitted and approved, it is 
doubtful that the selection of an eventual single candidate of 
the majority could take place. [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur 
has asked his majority not to open the presidential debate 
before 1995, and it is difficult to imagine primaries- 
-necessarily organized for the second half of 1994--that would 
force candidates, beginning with the prime minister himself, to 
reveal their intentions prematurely. Were this to be the case, 
Balladur, who intends to govern in a climate as serene as 
possible until the end of the year, would be inconvenienced more 
than others. 
  Charles Pasqua has certainly thought of these parameters. 
Hence, his initiative has another objective. He intends to force 
part of the majority --first of all Giscard and Chirac--to 
reverse their position officially. If they to persist in 
rejecting the procedure, they would be seen by the electorate of 
the majority as bad players. Pasqua, and no doubt Balladur as 
well, thus hope to palm off on them the evils of division. 
Indeed, following the 1981 and 1988 presidential elections, 
those who will be judged responsible for a new break in the 
Right run the significant risk of being accused of a mortal sin.

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Francois Leotard obtained 
confirmation from the Budget Ministry: The Defense Ministry's 
1995-2000 military program law will provide for an annual 
increase of 0.5 percent in equipment expenditure. For the armed 
forces and the Ministry, which initially requested an increase 
of 3 to 5 percent on the basis of the 100.4-billion-franc 
spending obligated in the 1994 budget, this certainly is no 
great prize. However, with this pledged increase over the next 
few years, the defense budget actually constitutes an exception 
to the multiyear Law on Public Expenditure Control, which 
stipulates a 0.5-percent decrease in all state budgets. 
Initially, the Budget Ministry had requested that equipment 
spending in the miliatary program law be reduced by 1 percent 
instead of 0.5 percent. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet </F>
by Yann Le Gales and Arnaud Rodier; place and date not given: 
"Making Bull an Autonomous Company"] 
  [Text] [LE FIGARO] What lessons have you learned from your 
trip to Japan? 
  [Longuet] We were able to confirm and support the recent 
inroads made by French companies in Japan. I am in particular 
thinking of the authorization to import pork products obtained 
this summer and the opening up of certain local markets. These 
include public works markets GTM [Marseille Heavy Construction 
Works] was chosen for the construction of the customs clearance 
center at Yokohama) and transport markets, with the recent sale 
of an Aerospatiale helicopter to the Hokkaido local authorities. 
This sale is symbolic in a country where European helicopters 
have a 40-percent stake in the private market without ever 
having won the smallest public contract until now. 
  I was also able to note that the "Japan is possible" 
campaign 
has enabled a number of companies, often small concerns, to gain 
a foothold in this country, which is the second largest world 
economic power. As a result, at the "Foodex" agro-food fair 
there were some 40 companies which had successfully overcome the 
initial barrier and are now developing everyday trading 
relations. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you have the feeling that this country is 
opening up its market to a greater extent? 
  [Longuet] My visit came at a time when Japan is experiencing 
a political upheaval while another upheaval, an economic one, is 
looming on the horizon. It is clear that the new government is 
displaying its intentions of opening up to the outside world, 
and it is up to us to seize the opportunity. Moreover, there is 
a significant desire to deregulate on the domestic level, 
especially in trade and distribution. It is good that French 
companies are getting a foothold. 
  Lastly, my role has been to make it clear to the Japanese 
authorities that we condemn any kind of unilateralism, such as, 
for example, the reimplementation of the "Super 301" provision 
by the United States. We should give priority to dialogue. 
Thus, Europe will be very careful to ensure that the settling 
of the U.S.-Japanese trade dispute does not have adverse effects 
on our exports. 
  [LE FIGARO] You caused a bit of a stir in France when you 
said that there was no limit to NEC's stake in Bull. Should we 
understand by that that you are ready to sell Bull to a Japanese 
company? 
  [Longuet] The government wants to make Bull an autonomous 
company in which the state will no longer have a majority 
shareholding. Thus we are making each of the possible partners 
face up to their responsibilities. That goes for the Europeans 
as well as NEC and IBM. This implies our saying to NEC that we 
view it with no suspicion and that all offers are welcome. It 
is unlikely that NEC is a candidate for an absolute majority 
stake. Quite simply, when you throw the thing open, there is no 
reason to restrict the rules. 
  [LE FIGARO] Do you not prefer, however, the majority stake 
to 
be held by Europeans? 
  [Longuet] Yes. I believe that Europeans will remain the 
majority shareholders in Bull. If they want to take a stake, 
they should do so now. They will not be able to accuse us later 
of not having made them face up to their responsibilities. 
  [LE FIGARO] Have the NEC managers you met with made any 
proposals? 
  [Longuet] No, and what is more, I never asked them to make 
any. It is simply a question of confirming to them that the race 
is now on. Those partners who are interested should let us know. 
  [LE FIGARO] Why did you decide so quickly that Bull should 
be 
privatized? 
  [Longuet] We have recapitalized the company with long-term 
objectives. Bull's privatization must be based on a balanced 
distribution of capital. It is up to the company to suggest the 
way, and we will then organize it together. It is not the 
state's intention to pull out of the shareholding completely. 
The personnel and all those who want to be associated with the 
operation, and the current shareholders -- France Telecom, NEC, 
and IBM -- have been asked. It is up to them to come forward. 
  [LE FIGARO] Will you force France Telecom to participate in 
the operation? What is it about Bull that interests NEC? 
  [Longuet] NEC is focusing on multimedia communications 
systems. It considers that Bull could be its partner in this 
area. France Telecom, too, is active in these fields. This is 
all to further the company's development. 
  [LE FIGARO] In the automobile sector, you have asked for the 
European-Japanese agreement to be extended for another two 
years. Why? 
  [Longuet] The year 1993 was so bad that we have to find a 
way 
of spreading the effects of the recession over a period of time. 
Clearly, it was not possible to strictly apply the terms of the 
agreement in 1993. I therefore suggested that the agreement be 
extended by two years. 
  [LE FIGARO] Did you not also ask Japan to open up to a 
greater extent to French suppliers? 
  [Longuet] I made it clear to the Japanese that French 
suppliers are capable of serving Japanese industry. Only 1.4 
percent of the suppliers Japan uses for the automobile sector 
are foreign companies. We must increase this figure fivefold as 
quickly as possible. This is all the more of logical since the 
Japanese know the European suppliers very well through their 
plants in Europe. 
  [LE FIGARO] The privatization of Bull, announced during your 
trip, coincided with the postponement of Renault's 
privatization. Are you disappointed at this? 
  [Longuet] Not at all. No one is contesting the privatization 
of Renault. The Volvo agreement made rapid action essential. 
Now that the agreement with Volvo looks less likely, Renault 
will have to take time to reflect. There are two possible 
choices: We either privatize Renault and leave it to the 
company to find partners; or we present possibilities for 
partnerships for the approval of the shareholders. It is this 
second option that was taken. 
  [LE FIGARO] Does Renault have to find a partner immediately? 
  [Longuet] Europe's surplus production capacity is about two 
million cars. The smallest and weakest will pay the heaviest 
price for this situation. Renault would not want to be among 
them.

  [Text] After the demonstrations against the youth 
vocational training contract (CIP), Budget Minister Nicolas 
Sarkozy declared: "We will maintain the CIP. This is the 
question that I would like to ask to all demonstrators." He 
added, "Should we tolerate that 750,000 young people are 
unemployed, or should we do something about it?" He insisted 
that "we have to solve this problem, and we will solve it," 
adding "the question is not so much whether we stick to the CIP; 
the question is: what is the formula to give jobs to 
youngsters." Nicolas Sarkozy continued: "We suggest this 
formula; nobody is suggesting another one. If it produces 
results, if it reduces youth unemployment, we will have done 
something useful for France." According to the minister, "all 
traditional measures have failed." And he asked: "Why do you 
want us to stop this experiment for electoral reasons? And what 
if the French think it better to experiment than to fail?"

<F P=106> [Article by Irina de Chikoff: "Alain Juppe: At the Risk of </F>
Existing"] 
  [Text] As a result of the GATT negotiations and 
his management of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Alain 
Juppe, still secretary general of the RPR [Rally for the 
Republic], has emerged as one of the leading figures in the 
Balladur Government. 
  Too much of a dandy to reveal his heroic nature, the foreign 
affairs minister seems rather to have descended from the line of 
the musketeers. More Aramis than d'Artagnan--he was a cadet in 
Gascogny in his younger days and the epic dimension is essential 
to him--he sits down at the table at L'Ami Louis as if he were 
Porthos, but when he takes up his pen, Athos appears. In the 
days of Louis XIII, he would have been a dashing swashbuckler, 
thumbing his nose at the Cardinal. Born on 15 August 1945 in 
Mont-de-Marsan in Landes, where his father was a farmer, Juppe 
enrolled at the Ecole Normale, earned his doctorate, and 
graduated from the ENA [National School of Administration]. 
  He looks like an Andalusian. It is easy to imagine him 
striking the bullfighter's pose in the middle of the arena, with 
cries of "Bravo!" from the Sevillians ringing in his ears. As a 
matter of pride, he disdains "applause meters" and refuses to 
"tailor" an image for himself. Yet how could he manage to 
refrain from glancing--albeit scornfully--at the polls, 
particularly when they are so favorable to him? "I have been 
popular for the past two weeks," Juppe says. About to turn 49, 
he thinks people have been somewhat slow to discover him. He 
loves to be recognized for his qualities and does indeed have 
some, having "toiled" since he was a child. 
  Ever the leader of the class, he entered politics by virtue 
of "the Word." In 1976, Jerome Monod brought him on board as a 
speech writer for Jacques Chirac, then Valery Giscard 
d'Estaing's prime minister. Technical adviser to the mayor of 
Paris in 1978, then the capital's director of finance, he was 
next elected deputy from the 18th arrondissement in 1983 after 
two failures in Landes. Beginning in 1984, he handled economic 
affairs for the RPR. Appointed deputy minister for the budget 
during the first cohabitation, he was never able to show his 
stuff and fretted and fumed in the shadow of Edouard Balladur, 
then head of Finance. 
  His attempt to lend credit to the idea that there was a 
"Juppe band," just as there was a "Leotard band" at the time, 
fell short. 
<H5>  Quai d'Orsay </H5>
  In 1988, he became secretary general of the RPR and 
transformed it from top to bottom. In 1989, on the ticket behind 
Valery Giscard d'Estaing, he headed the RPR-UDF [French 
Democratic Union] list in the European elections. In 1992, he 
had to stand aside for Michel Giraud as president of the 
Ile-de-France region. Indeed, he has had his fill of "playing 
the supporting role." Like d'Artagnan meeting Rochefort, he 
could say, 20 years later: "Me? A favorite? I am more the cadet 
from Gascogny than when I first saw you in Meung (...), still a 
lieutenant of the musketeers!" 
  The March 1993 legislative elections opened new horizons for 
him. This time he would refuse to be denied, preparing with 
diplomatic advisers. He studied all the issues, made contacts, 
went after the indispensable connections, beleaguered the Quai 
d'Orsay even before the outcome of the election. 
  Once the elections were over, there was no choice but to 
yield to the evidence: Juppe had to go to Foreign Affairs. 
Edouard Balladur supported him, Francois Mitterrand put up no 
objection, and even if Jacques Chirac said he was still 
indispensable on Rue de Lille, Juppe stood firm. Go for it! 
Either he would captain the ship or he would start touring RPR 
federations in the Overseas Departments and Territories 
(DOM-TOM)! Chirac yielded and Juppe made one concession: Even 
though he would take office at the Quai, he would remain 
secretary general of the RPR. 
  The press soon began to talk about Juppe's metamorphosis. No 
longer is he the pretender to the throne with a fine future in 
store for him! He is said to be less abrupt, to which he has a 
concise reply: "Public office ennobles one." He manages to exist 
between the Elysee and the Matignon [office of the prime 
minister], no mean feat. His name is constantly in the 
newspapers. At the Quai d'Orsay, he is Prince Charming come to 
waken Sleeping Beauty! The president praises the 
"professionalism" of the new minister who comes every Tuesday 
evening at 1700 hours for a private discussion of current 
affairs. Juppe always has his homework done, arriving with the 
"finished product," as his aides put it. Nothing is left to 
chance. Everything is prepared by Quai d'Orsay teams, analyzed 
by experts, confirmed with sources in embassies now working in 
direct contact with the minister's staff. 
  Following his meeting with the chief of state, Juppe goes to 
the Matignon to pin things down with the prime minister. Things 
are finalized at the Cabinet meeting the next day, after which 
the Cabinet inner circle further refines the issues. The Quai 
d'Orsay is immediately informed of possible adjustments and 
adapts as quickly. 
  "The blood is finally circulating at headquarters," 
according 
to Dominique de Villepin, Juppe's chief of staff, "and despite 
the cohabitation, decisions are made more quickly than they were 
before." For him and his deputy, Maurice Gourdault Montagne, 
there are no secrets or magic. They summarize the Juppe method: 
"Mobilization of staffers, maximum synthesis, and integration of 
the media." They conclude: "The Matignon is never dizzy and the 
Elysee is not worried." 
  In his enormous office, Juppe allows himself a cautious 
smile. Sensitive to compliments as all men are--politicians are 
even moreso--the foreign affairs minister does not conceal his 
pleasure, saying, "I am totally at home." They shower him with 
praise, endlessly refer to his intelligence--the sharpest of his 
generation--the strength of his convictions, his pugnaciousness 
vis-a-vis the Americans, who were so reluctant to get further 
involved in the Bosnian crisis. He stares at the soles of his 
loafers, not finding the praise too effusive. Early on he had 
sought to have the "doorway to power" open to him, had been kept 
waiting in the corridors too long. The GATT negotiations and the 
war in the former Yugoslavia finally allowed him to take off. 
Never had he doubted himself; only the ability of others to 
recognize that he is worth more than his reputation as a machine 
politician and technocrat. 
<H5>  Tragic Dimension </H5>
  But what about the GATT talks? For him it was an 
"interesting" issue. At his first European Council of Ministers 
meeting on 5 April, his mission consisted of gaining time and he 
obtained a one-month delay. In May, he presented France's 
memorandum and the Europeans began to understand Paris' logic. 
In September, Juppe, as head of the delegation, crossed swords 
with Sir Leon Brittan, who was conducting the negotiations on 
behalf of the European Commission, and imposed a mandate on him, 
warning: "It is not you who have the power to make decisions; we 
do!" In December, he played in a link-up with Nicolas Bazire, 
Balladur's chief of staff, and the two won the last game. Juppe 
would like the prime minister to remember it. 
  And Bosnia? "I am measuring precisely what it means to 
assume 
one's responsibilities," Juppe says. "Because we have 2,000 men 
in the field, the issue has a tragic dimension." The minister 
admits his anxiety: "If it turns out badly, if we have to start 
strikes...." And yet, he also affirms his determination: "We 
must not back down or we shall suffer an even greater disaster." 
No one begrudges Juppe his share of the success in the handling 
of the crisis or his ability to convince the United States that 
France is not trying to get that country bogged down, but merely 
to save what is left to be saved. 
  Immobile but vibrant, his face unlined--his enemies accuse 
him of holding back, of emerging from all battles apparently 
intact--his legs crossed, Juppe is visibly happy. He has thrived 
at the Quai. His chief of staff, Patrick Stofanini, and his 
assistant, Jean-Louis Debre, are looking after things in the 
RPR. He personally visits Rue de Lille once or twice a week. 
Despite a heavy schedule, he never gives the impression of being 
in a hurry. Juppe is not a man to let himself be overwhelmed. 
All his pencils are sharpened, all his business organized, 
nothing is left dragging on his desk. He is not even fanatical; 
just organized. He now jogs less than he once did, naturally, 
but whenever he can he slips off to the Interallie to swim a few 
laps. 
  What is his schedule like? Monday: Hotel de Ville de Paris 
with the top dogs in the RPR. Tuesday: breakfast with Francois 
Leotard, lunch at the Matignon, the Elysee in the late 
afternoon, back to the Matignon. Wednesday: Cabinet meeting, 
lunch with members of Parliament, a meeting if there is one. 
Thursday: private meeting. Friday: meeting of the Quai d'Orsay 
chiefs of staff. Travel, receptions, meetings, campaign travel 
for the cantonal elections tucked into the basic schedule. 
  The weeks fly by, which does not frighten Juppe. He fears 
only routine boredome, time wasted picking daisies! All doubts 
have dissipated; depression also. He has emerged from the cadet 
pack and knows it. Is it zest for the game or Athos-type 
lucidity? "The Tarpeian Rock is close to the Capitol," he says. 
Often swept to the pinnacles, he has never fallen in the literal 
sense of the word, but observes that people forget him almost as 
quickly. Why can he never quite catch the light? 
<H5>  Desire To Compete </H5>
  People refer to his moodiness, labeling him as cold, 
impatient, scornful, to which he replies: "I am not very 
relaxed. I am also competitive. I like to compare myself with 
others, get into the fray, find the chink in the other man's 
armor. I like to engage in irony. I don't like people to meddle 
in my business and say so." 
  Juppe takes a drink of cold water without offering anyone 
else any, but does not even notice. His aides say he often 
passes right by without even seeing them and they make no bones 
about it: "Alain is off on another of his tangents!" 
  He is not an emotional man, they explain, but one can 
nevertheless rely on him. He is never a wheedler and is a loyal 
friend. In his book, The Venetian Temptation, the 
foreign affairs minister raises one corner of the veil, 
describing his emotions, his rage, his tears when he listens to 
Verdi. Alain Juppe the romantic? 
  It would not be smart to make such an argument with a number 
of RPR leaders or deputies. For them, the man is a kind of 
computer (have they not dubbed him "Amstrad"?)--an ambitious, 
arrogant martinet? "To catch up with Alain Juppe," says one of 
his friends in his defense, "you have to get on the mule path." 
  Either the top or nothing. A fugue is an obsessive kind of 
music that runs through the foreign minister's head. It is as if 
he had a furious desire to exist, not to miss out on "real 
life!" What if it were to be found elsewhere? Juppe succombs to 
the temptation whenever fate is unkind to him. It is at these 
times that he is ready to become a wanderer or archeologist like 
Aramis, who became a priest every time the Duchess of Chevreuse 
seemed about to leave him. Yet one letter from his beloved and 
he was off again! The musketeer gives the orders: "Fat capon, 
larded rabbit, leg of lamb with garlic, and four bottles of old 
burgundy!" At the Quai, Juppe no longer thinks about his periods 
of Beethoven, Hugo or Chateaubriand. Never again will they make 
him eat crow, as they did in the last regional elections. He is 
free, a real contender, liberated from all the old yokes. One 
has but to see him to understand that he has settled all 
accounts, paid his debts, and any other dues. His fate seemed to 
precede him, but he has finally caught up with it. He has seized 
it at the risk of never again being able to change it!

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Noted political analyst Alain Duhamel 
comments on the Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's successes in the 
25 February Paris daily LIBERATION. Juppe's course has been "the 
most spectacular and most convincing" in the government, he 
contends. The conduct of the Geneva GATT negotiations, the 
initiative that led to the Sarajevo ultimatum and his ability to 
ensure the participation of a "refractory" United States, as 
well as his success in re-mobilizing his ministry have all 
furnished proof of his "brilliance" and his "energy" as a 
negotiator. In addition, President Francois Mitterrand 
appreciates the "limpidity of his analyses and expressions," 
Duhamel continues. A "formerly prickly and narcissistic" Juppe 
is beginning to relax, he notes, adding that with an 
"intellectual rapidity that quickly makes him impatient, and a 
dominating temperament and self-confidence that do not 
predispose him to tolerance," the foreign minister is not a 
consensual politician. In Duhamel's view, Juppe's attributes 
make him "the most promising of the forty-somethings," together 
with Socialist Party (PS) luminary Laurent Fabius. Just like his 
"sworn enemy" Philippe Seguin, president of the National 
Assembly, Charles Pasqua, minister of interior, and a more 
"seductive and politically inclined but less coherent" Francois 
Leotard, the defense minister, Juppe can aspire to the prime 
ministership, Duhamel contends. However, "there is a hitch," for 
Juppe is secretary general of the Rally for the Republic (RPR), 
a position which, in the opinion of some, makes for "one Juppe 
too many." Not that the foreign minister lacks governmental 
loyalty, Duhamel admits. However, Juppe must daily act on two 
levels. While Prime Minister Edouard Balladur profits from his 
minister's performance, Juppe's views as RPR "number two" 
strengthen Jacques Chirac, notably when he insists that the 
latter is the party's natural presidential candidate. This leads 
Balladur to distance himself from Juppe and "carefully omit to 
compliment him in public," for he does not want him to head a 
single majority list in the European Parliament elections. 
  Juppe will soon hold "redoubtable" power, Duhamel comments, 
for he, Charles Pasqua, and Philippe Seguin will be the "three 
great RPR barons" to weigh in at the time of the choice between 
Balladur and Chirac. Seguin is opposed to Balladur and Pasqua 
has distanced himself from him. Whichever of the "two Juppe's" 
triumphs over the other will be influential, but will also be 
"mutilating himself," Duhamel concludes.

  [Excerpts] Franz-Olivier Giesbert's guest is Bernard 
Bosson, minister of equipment, transport, and tourism. 
  [Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, good morning. 
  [Bosson] Good morning. 
  [Giesbert] You are a minister of everything, aren't you? 
  [Bosson] Indeed, of parts of daily life and of preparation 
for the future. 
  [Giesbert] We have not heard from you since Christian Blanc, 
Air France chairman, a manager, a very courageous man, published 
details of his plan last week. What is your first impression? 
  [Bosson] It is extraordinary that the minister should be in 
the limelight when things are going badly. When things are 
going well, it is not the case. 
  [Giesbert] Are you trying to tell us that things are going 
well for Air France? 
  [Bosson] I believe that things are going well with Christian 
Blanc. 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] What about the deficit? 
  [Bosson] With Christian Blanc appointed by the government at 
my suggestion. We have changed our method radically. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Giesbert] Bernard Bosson, would it not be a good idea to 
privatize Air France right now, quickly? 
  [Bosson] One of the things that is far from being on the 
agenda is the privatization of Air France. On the contrary, 
what is on the agenda... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] Why? Why not? 
  [Bosson] On the contrary, what is... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] Why? 
  [Bosson] Do you know anyone who would be willing to buy an 
Air France share in the present state of the company? The real 
problem... 
  [Giesbert, interrupting] I don't understand. You are going 
to privatize Bull. It has a huge deficit too. 
  [Bosson] No, this is irrelevant. 
  [Giesbert] Bull.... 
  [Bosson, interrupting] I have tried to save the company, to 
do it with the men and women at Air France, and not against 
them. What is on the agenda is the participation of employees. 
[passage omitted] Twenty-five percent of the capital will be 
shared by the employees -- 10 percent by all and the rest for 
those who will agree to work more and to be paid with shares, 
those who will believe in the future of their company and 
mobilize the company around its chairman. 
  [Giesbert] What you are telling me this morning is 
interesting, Bernard Bosson, that is: The privatization of Air 
France is not on the agenda, it will not take place for a long 
time, maybe never. 
  [Bosson] This seems obvious to me, it is a different issue 
altogether. The present issue is to save our national company 
so that it is not the only great European company to disappear 
or to be bought up. Should our fleet fly under the flag of 
British Airways or a U.S. company in the future, I don't think 
that it would be a great French victory. This seems obvious to 
me. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Milan, March 16 (AFP) -- A Milan judge on Wednesday 
[16 March] rejected a request for the arrest of six businessmen, 
including three officials in media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's 
communications group Fininvest, judicial sources said. 
  But while turning down the demands, judge Anna Introini 
ruled 
that investigations into the accused would continue. Judicial 
sources said this was "because of serious indications of guilt." 
  The arrests were demanded last week by prosecutors leading 
the Clean Hands corruption investigating, in connection with 
fraud and false accounting allegations. 
  Berlusconi, head of the Go, Italy party [Forza Italia] in 
general elections due for March 27 and 28, immediately welcomed 
Wednesday's decision, saying that "justice had been carried out." 
  The judge said she had decided not to order their arrests as 
there was no danger they would flee, or that they could tamper 
with documents involved in the investigation. 
  Berlusconi, who has been ahead in some recent polls, has 
accused some of the investigating magistrates, above all 
Gherardo Colombo of Milan, of seeking to bring him down in the 
middle of an election campaign. 
  The three Berlusconi officials involved are: Marcello 
Dell`Utri, the administrator for his advertising agency 
Publitalia, Romano Luzzi, who also works for Publitalia, and the 
director general of his Telepiu television channel, Valerio 
Ghilardelli.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Occhetto Backs Ciampi"] </F>
  [Text] "Ciampi said right away that he wants to remain 
impartial in this election campaign; we therefore acted very 
cautiously; we certainly could not put him forward as our 
candidate. But Ciampi remains an asset for the country and for 
democracy." Achille Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party 
of the Left, PDS] said this in an interview with Minoli on 
"Mixer" [TV talk show]. And by so saying, the PDS leader 
strengthened a kind of post-election investiture for Ciampi 
launched a few hours earlier by [PDS Deputy Secretary] Massimo 
d'Alema in an interview with CORRIERE DELLA SERA ("A policy of 
financial reform," the PDS' second in command said, "could be 
pursued by a new government headed by Ciampi.") Moreover, when 
Minoli ["Mixer" host] reminded him that the AD [Democratic 
Alliance] has spoken explicitly in terms of a future Ciampi 
government with Communist Renewal in the opposition, Occhetto 
did not rule out the possibility and spoke about a "Ciampi 
government on the road already begun, with the addition of new 
innovative policies." 
  But d`Alema's remarks had already sparked very different 
responses among the progressive forces yesterday afternoon. 
While [AD leader] Adornato was full of praise ("Now the voters 
know that, if the progressive forces win, Ciampi will be prime 
minister"), [Communist Renewal leader] Fausto Bertinotti imposed 
a rigid veto: ("Ciampi has personified the economic policy that 
led to the collapse of employment"). 
  These two very different positions were defended strongly by 
both sides. Adornato: "If we had not been sure about the 
prospects afforded by Ciampi we would have found it hard to join 
the progressive pole." Bertinotti: "The forces allied with us 
cannot hope for victory if they shift toward center stances." 
[Italian Republican Party Secretary] Giorgio La Malfa added a 
comment and something more to the progressive forces' varying 
positions: "The PDS clearly feels embarrassed with regard to 
its allies; Communist Renewal is a not insignificant component 
of the left-wing alignment, and is indeed essential to the 
formation of a government." So, according to La Malfa, it is 
impossible for the entire left to adopt a clear stance on what 
is such a fundamental issue. 
  This position on Ciampi was the focus for the whole of 
Occhetto's interview on "Mixer," which was recorded yesterday 
afternoon, before the spectacular evening news about judicial 
developments regarding the PCI [Italian Communist Party]-PDS. 
But Occhetto did have plenty to say about justice ("The 
judiciary are active in justice, not politics. And the PDS has 
been treated with the same severity as has been accorded to all 
the rest"), as he did about [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, 
for whom he reserved this poisoned barb: "He calls us 
communists, contemptuously. We did not disgust him when he used 
to come to PCI headquarters to argue the cause of his television 
stations." He went on: "As a person? Let us say that he is 
someone with whom I would never go on vacation; he is too 
overbearing and embodies every characteristic of the right, 
starting with the desire to trample the weak." 
  With regard to the issue of Sisde funds, he said: "It is I 
who am asking for the names of people who may have received 
money; I really would not trust having them at my side. In any 
case, do you think it would be possible for the PDS to request 
money from the secret services?" On the subject of Mafia 
threats against the PDS, he said: "There have been some; the 
Mafia has taken sides in these elections." And in connection 
with collusion between the progressive forces and the Mafia, he 
said: "I know that [newspaper editor] Montanelli said something 
of this kind in an interview, but where are the names?"

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto </F>
Bertinotti by Carlo Fusi; place and date not given: 
"Bertinotti: Never in a Government With Ciampi"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fusi] Bertinotti, why are you 
not saying anything at his point in the election campaign? Will 
the left win? 
  [Bertinotti] I really do not know. I do not want to give the 
impression of being reticent, because I am not like this. I 
think that when you make a commitment, when you fight, when you 
battle, you must not be distracted by forecasts. Also because 
forecasts are always either an exorcism or a desire. You must 
be committed to win. That is all. 
  [Fusi] You have just returned from Bari.... 
  [Bertinotti] Yes, from an election meeting where I saw a 
great deal of the enthusiasm for the old PCI [Italian Communist 
Party]. And a lot of young people are among our followers. 
  [Fusi] Let me finish. Why not go to London? [Achille] 
Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] 
went, as did Roberto Maroni [Northern League lower house floor 
leader]. What is holding you back? 
  [Bertinotti] I am not going because I do not speak English 
well. 
  [Fusi] Or because you fear that when the city bankers see 
you 
they will run away terrorized? 
  [Bertinotti] I do not intend criticizing the others, but 
since the Italians will be the ones to vote, the right thing to 
do is to dedicate ourselves to them and to their sovereignty. 
Once we used to go to the United States, then to London.... 
When talking about the elections, I prefer Italy. 
  [Fusi] Let us talk about elections then. I will draw a 
picture. The left gains the absolute majority. What will 
Communist Renewal do, ask for its own ministries? 
  [Bertinotti] The technical discussion over the composition 
of 
the government is entirely premature. If the progressives 
really win, the government structure would have to be reexamined 
in light of the objective of renewal and transformation. 
  [Fusi] Translated this means: less ministries? 
  [Bertinotti] Yes, and composed differently. The ministries 
are currently divided according to the administrative concept of 
politics. I will give you an example: If the central issue is 
the battle against unemployment, how can it be handled without 
considering labor, the environment, and the territory at the 
same time? 
  [Fusi] Okay, but the communist ministers? 
  [Bertinotti] If the progressives win the absolute majority 
they would have a moral obligation to govern alongside the same 
aggregation with which they won. 
  [Fusi] And who should go to Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? 
  [Bertinotti] First I must say that we are against giving the 
name of a premier because it distorts the sense of this 
political battle which must be centered around programs, not 
men. The characteristic of the left is that it is the 
antagonist of the right and an alternative to the center. 
  [Fusi] Yes, but the programs are marching with the legs of 
the men who embody them.... 
  [Bertinotti] I am against speeding up the times for what I 
consider to be a counterreform, the direct election of the head 
of government. These elections are already suggesting to many 
that those like us, who supported the validity of the 
proportional system, were right. I do not want us to fall into 
a worse situation now with even more summit meetings. Once the 
polls close, we must see which of the various elements that gave 
rise to the progressive alliance, which I rightly support, has 
taken hold best. I am referring not only to votes, but also to 
the topics and leaders during the election campaign. 
  [Fusi] Do not slink away, Bertinotti... [PDS Deputy 
Secretary] d'Alema has reproposed the current prime minister. 
What will you do? Ciampi yes, or Ciampi no? 
  [Bertinotti] We have already clearly expressed our firm 
opposition to the nomination of Ciampi and will not change our 
opinion. This is by no means a sign of disregard toward a 
worthy person in the Italian political scene as far as his moral 
profile is concerned. However, we will not fail to show our 
dissent over the general lines that characterized his 
government, and that the progressives must discontinue. In 
particular, in a central issue: This government has not carried 
out any political innovation in the fight against unemployment, 
rather it has continued along the lines of the Amato government, 
which was one of the causes of unemployment. 
  [Fusi] What about the institutional government? 
  [Bertinotti] Never, never. It would be a paradox. The 
elections are being carried out in a context of bitter 
opposition between the right and the progressives. Would we 
have to follow with a new transformism, saying that we were 
joking? No way. 
  [Fusi] Another topic, taxing treasury bills. Are you 
surprised that even Berlusconi's economic expert Antonio Martino 
is now demonstrating the possibilities? 
  [Bertinotti] First, this proposal comes precisely from the 
economists of the left, starting with August Graziani. Then, it 
is shared by people like Mario Monti, rector at the Bocconi 
University, who stands at the center of Italian economic life. 
What do I mean? That there is a certain amount of reason behind 
this proposal. Since I think that there is still a great deal of 
confusion over this, I would like to emphasize that I have 
always talked about taxing anybody who has more than 200 million 
lire in treasury bills. There is a great difference. The 
proposal made by Forza Italia in fiscal matters is entirely 
incompatible with mine. Berlusconi has the opposite idea: less 
taxes for the rich and more taxes for the poor. 
  [Fusi] Let us draw another picture. The left wins but 
without getting the absolute majority. At that point would you 
accept the idea of an accord between the progressives and the 
center? 
  [Bertinotti] No. We do not want to force anybody. However, 
we interpret the mobilization of the progressives, their entry 
into the field, including the declaration of intent that 
represented their calling card, as being a political proposal 
that is antagonistic to the right and an alternative to the 
moderates. We are aiming at the victory of the progressives but 
without any subordinate clauses. Rather, we think that any 
subordinate clause, starting with an alliance with the 
moderates, would seriously damage the left in this election 
campaign, and would be an error after the elections. 
  [Fusi] What if the balance of power depends on the center? 
  [Bertinotti] We have no ideological prejudices but we want 
to 
change the country. The proposals made by the center are the 
continuation of Amato and Ciampi. They are either 
undecipherable or of a moderate nature. We want a break with 
the past, they do not. There must be preventive consultations 
and discussions among the progressives. Then each will make his 
own choice. 
  [Fusi] Bertinotti, once and for all: Is it better to lose 
alone or to win together with the others? 
  [Bertinotti] This question embodies the damnation of the 
more radical forces that we identify ourselves with. Both 
routes are catastrophic because they lead to a subordinate 
position in one case and a ghetto in the other. We defeated 
both routes at our congress by adhering to the progressive pole, 
and bringing inside the pole the contents of the radical 
petitions for change. [passage omitted] 
  [Fusi] Let us return to politics. You say that the left must 
win. To do this, however, it must get at least part of the 
moderates' votes. What do you offer them to convince them to 
line up with the progressives? 
  [Bertinotti] One basic consideration. These elections will 
decide between two different social models, between two 
different types of civilization, as happened in Italy in 1948 
and 1953 with the fraudulent law. I hope that the moderate 
alignment understands that there is room for them and for their 
requests in the model of civilization that the progressives are 
proposing, because it is a highly pluralistic model that 
respects everything and everybody. On the right instead there 
is an authoritative model, which is strongly oppressive, with 
the absolute prevalence of business and market interests over 
those of society. This model can only generate polarization and 
acute conflicts. For this reason I think that the moderates 
must vote for the progressives: to avoid finding themselves in 
front of a country divided in two. I add, and this time I refer 
to the progressives, that politics is not geometry: 
preestablished spaces and property to be occupied. Politics is 
the movement of forces. The moderate side has moved to the 
left, it was involved in the change when the forces of the left 
were able to create a movement and were able to put a pervasive 
culture on the field. And not when they simply followed the 
moderates, thinking that they were occupying a space. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Vittorio Testa: "Institutional Government: </F>
Berlusconi Now Says `Yes'"] 
  [Text] Rome -- Mr. Berlusconi [Forza Italia leader], have 
you heard what [Northern League leader] Bossi is saying? 
Berlusconi grew angry yesterday morning when he arrived from 
Arcore at his Rome house on via dell`Anima and heard people 
repeating Bossi's contemptuous litany of the previous day. 
Bossi is saying that from now on he will call you "Berluscone" 
or "Berluscaz"; that if there is an institutional government, 
you will disappear; that he allied with you because, as 
Machiavelli taught, if you cannot defeat an enemy directly it is 
better to ally with him, "to embrace him in order to hit him 
later"; that when he talked to you about antimonopoly measures 
you replied evasively that the matter will be examined by 
committees.... "Oh, yes? I have never talked to Bossi about 
antimonopoly measures or committees. But that is enough, I do 
not feel like discussing Bossi," Berlusconi said, waving his 
hand like someone trying to swat a fly. 
  In the evening the news agencies reported other, even more 
sensational, political broadsides: "Berlusconi's opinion polls 
are false," Bossi shouted, going on to attack "the RAI-Fininvest 
duopoly," and accuse Berlusconi of having attacked Confindustria 
[General Confederation of Italian Industry] "in order to confuse 
matters within the pole [for freedoms]. But he cannot be the 
representative of economic liberalism, of small and medium-sized 
enterprise." And still it was not over: Bossi's big guns fired 
again: "Within Forza Italia there is something of the recycled 
Five-Party coalition; behind it there is [former Socialist Party 
Secretary] Craxi, `fatso.'" Bossi urged League supporters to 
plan their defenses: "Raise your guard! Because after the 
Bribe City farce, those people will return. They say that we 
use strong language: Yes, and we do so because we are working 
class people. We must not speak with affected voices, wearing 
toupees, in fluting tones, and surrounded by pink clouds. No! 
Beware, people, they are deceiving you because they are trying 
to return in disguise." 
  It was an evening for Berlusconi to vent his anger. Now all 
that is lacking is for Bossi to urge League members to vote for 
the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] rather than for Forza 
Italia. But Berlusconi let it be known that he had taken his 
telephone of the hook -- no comment, nothing to add to what he 
said in the morning, namely, the following regretful 
consideration: "I console myself by thinking about [PDS Deputy 
Secretary] D'Alema. I see that he is saying that if I lose the 
elections I will have to pack my bags and go abroad. That is 
progress, in view of the fact that hitherto he has been saying 
that he wants to see me in the street begging for charity. He 
must have been magnanimous enough to grant me a passport." 
  But apart from a few reluctant comments and some 
compassionate head shaking, Berlusconi, who took part in "Nuccio 
Fava's Election Platform" on television channel one last night, 
explained his political strategy. His strategy is based on the 
belief that Forza Italia will emerge from the elections as 
"Italy's prime political force." "So it will be impossible to 
form any government without Forza Italia," Berlusconi said, 
issuing the following warning to Bossi: "League candidates 
elected partly thanks to Forza Italia's votes would never accept 
the idea of a government alliance that excluded us. Because 
that would violate their honest relationship with their own 
voters." 
  So would Forza Italia join an institutional government if 
there were not a sufficient majority for a "full" government? 
Hitherto Berlusconi has refused even to consider the 
possibility. Now, under attack from Bossi, that is, his main 
ally, and therefore under attack from everyone plus one, he 
started by saying that he considers an institutional government 
"what the country needs least at present, in view of the very 
serious issues that it has to tackle vigorously, starting with a 
new boost to the economy and the struggle against unemployment." 
But then he decided to take the big step: "Yes, an 
institutional government comprising all the political forces. A 
transitional government to enable parliament quickly to draw up 
new electoral rules -- a single-candidate system in one round 
and, we say, also the direct election of the president -- and to 
hold another election as soon as possible, very soon." 
  So Berlusconi is willing to support an institutional 
government. But he is nevertheless convinced that he will emerge 
from the electoral contest as the absolute winner. Although in 
the past few days he has realized that the "uninominal" contest 
in his own constituency, against Spaventa and Michelini, is full 
of dangers. "The voters will decide which force and which prime 
minister must have the leading role in the government," 
Berlusconi said confidently. He repeated this on RAI's 
"Election Platform", which set three National Alliance 
representatives (Maceratini, Ramponi, and Fisichella) against 
three of the Forza Italia pole (Berlusconi, Maroni, and 
Taradash). It was basically a debate between "separate" allies, 
since Berlusconi is linked to [National Alliance coordinator] 
Fini in the center and south and to the League in the north. 
Though Maroni repeated that the League rejects any possibility 
of an agreement with Fini, Berlusconi said that he is 
"optimistic" and put himself forward as the guardian of a huge 
single party in the near future. Yesterday evening's debate was 
not a very lively one, Berlusconi having again refused one with 
the representatives of the progressive forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Umberto Bossi, Italian Northern League </F>
Secretary, by Guido Passalacqua in Udine; date not given: "The 
North is Our Domain" -- first three paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Udine -- At the 20th rally in 19 days, Umberto Bossi 
was still going strong, unrelentingly repeating his message: "I 
will have to continue explaining things until the very last 
minute. But the grassroots are more intelligent than the 
leaders." Bossi was also working out a forecast: "Given that 
there are 320 constituencies in the north, let us assume 70 of 
them will go to the left or -- let us be extra generous -- even 
100. That leaves 220. How much is 70 percent of 220? Let us be 
absolutely pessimistic, and forecast an even smaller figure. In 
any case, we will have more than 100 deputies. Therefore, the 
north is our domain, not [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's." 
  Racing toward Udine in his Thema, Bossi had no kind words 
for 
the Knight [Berlusconi nickname]. From Milan came the news of 
Berlusconi's statements at the convention: "Bossi is losing his 
credibility. I, Berlusconi, am being targeted by terrorists." 
The League's leader replied drily, without mincing his words: 
"Let him say what he likes, Berluscone (Bossi now calls him in 
this way, with a final `e' -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) is 
not interested in truth. As far as the attempt on his life is 
concerned, I do not believe in that story. This guy is aiming 
to recycle the Five-Party System. Bombs are placed by those who 
are in power, and it is those who are in power who are doing the 
recycling...." Bossi did not finish his syllogism, but what he 
had in mind was clear. "More than anything else, this looks 
like an advertising campaign. What is he trying to become now? 
A victim?" 
  However, it was on the night between Saturday [12 March] and 
Sunday that Bossi launched his most scathing attack. While his 
"enemy" and coalition fellow-traveler [Italian Social Movement 
Secretary] Fini -- an "ally" for whom the Knight only has words 
of praise and appreciation -- was soundly sleeping on the fourth 
floor of the Trieste Savoia Excelsior Hotel, the Senator [Bossi 
nickname], sitting in a small red armchair in the lobby, was 
prolific in jokes and political considerations, all of which 
were aimed in the same direction. It was four in the morning. 
Milan town councillor Pino Babbioni, who accompanies Bossi on 
all his trips, was sleeping in an armchair, and the supporters 
from Bergamo who make up Bossi's escort were drinking one Coke 
after the next, while the Senator carried on undaunted. 
  [Passalacqua] Why do you not appear on TV, like Berlusconi, 
who does so every second day? 
  [Bossi] I know that he appears on TV with [the secretary of 
Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] Occhetto. So I phoned 
[Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni and told him: 
"Arrange an appointment for me with Occhetto on the last day of 
the electoral campaign." I will not leave the last word to 
Berlusconi. 
  [Passalacqua] For some days now, you have been suggesting 
that you suspect the Knight and the PDS of having reached a 
post- electoral agreement. Why is this? 
  [Bossi] I have seen Occhetto legitimizing Fini on TV. So I 
told myself: What if he now tries to talk to the fascists via 
Berluscone? On the other hand, Berluscone was demonized by the 
PDS, and now they find it somewhat difficult to speak with him. 
  [Passalacqua] Do you speak with him? 
  [Bossi] Sometimes. He must be made aware that the League is 
keeping an eye on him. He must be made to hear the thunderstorm 
of the League. In fact, he is part of one of the families that 
count in Italy. He is part of the information twofold monopoly. 
Wake up people, wake up! Berluscone does not represent working 
people. Do you want to know what he said when I told him that 
we want serious antitrust legislation, enforced through the 
ordinary magistrature? He told me that he wants commissions to 
be set up... Commissions? We want antitrust legislation. 
  [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, they are saying that you are the 
new Ghino di Tacco [Craxi penname]. 
  [Bossi] Ghino di Tacco? What a joke! Behind "Berluscaz," I 
mean behind Berluscone, there is Craxi. I know he is looking 
for me, but if he calls me, I will make him hear the noise made 
by the drum of my revolver. 
  [Passalacqua] In short, what sort of future do you envisage 
for Italy after the elections? 
  [Bossi] If an institutional government is formed, and 
Berlusconi stays outside, then it is the end. 
  [Passalacqua] But if the pole of freedoms wins, have you 
already considered the problem of the premiership? It would be 
logical for Berlusconi to take up this post. 
  [Bossi] Never, never. 
  [Passalacqua] It is said that Berlusconi has also vetoed 
yours and Maroni's entry into Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's 
office]. Is this true? 
  [Bossi] I presume this is a case of canceling vetoes. 
  [Passalacqua] So everything is blocked. 
  [Bossi] Easy, my friend: On 29 March, we will be raising a 
30-meter flag in front of Palazzo Marino [Milan city hall], in 
Piazza della Scala -- the flag of federalism. 
  [Passalacqua] Is that all it boils down to -- a flag? 
  [Bossi] My friend, the government of this country will be 
born under such a flag. Under such a flag we will conduct 
negotiations. 
  [Passalacqua] What about Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] He will know in Pontida [League rally venue], on 10 
April. My friends, the north has a very powerful defender. 
  [Passalacqua] All your arguments are based on the assumption 
that the League will play a central political role, and that 
Berlusconi will not have a hegemonic position within the 
coalition. But what if Berlusconi achieves an overwhelming 
victory? What will happen then? 
  [Bossi] Overwhelming victory? How can he possibly achieve an 
overwhelming victory? The north is our domain. Do not forget 
that we have put him in a straitjacket. Seventy percent of the 
constituencies in the north will go to the League. I am not 
afraid of the pasteboard world created by Berluscone. 
  [Passalacqua] Are you sure? The opinion polls say the 
opposite... 
  [Bossi] If you find people bothersome, you cannot represent 
people. 
  [Passalacqua] If I may say so, you are speaking of someone 
who is supposed to be your ally.... 
  [Bossi] Machiavelli says that when you cannot beat an enemy 
you should have him as an ally.... 
  [Passalacqua] Some League supporters are against an alliance 
with Forza Italia, for example here in Veneto -- a good example 
is the Montebelluna section. However, there are also some who 
would like closer links with the Knight. 
  [Bossi] The answer to those who are against is that we must 
try to understand the situation, rather than clown around. I 
said so at the rally in Treviso. As far as the others are 
concerned, that story is old hat. If it had happened a year 
ago, our movement could have been broken in two. A few months 
ago I could feel that a venom was seeping in through the 
fringes, but then it stopped. Faxes and phonecalls are not 
enough to break the League. Fininvest tried to trap me, but it 
did not manage to do so.

<F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "Italy, A Vote for Employment"] </F>
  [Text] Never have the various party programs focused on the 
term "employment" as in this election campaign. Over the last 
few months, we have witnessed an alarmism about the number of 
jobs lost or "in jeopardy," whereas over the last few weeks lots 
of figures have been provided on how many jobs could be created 
through measures that need to be adopted in all sectors. 
  They range from flexibility in the job market to a policy of 
rigorous containment of public expenditure, from salary 
restraints to the use of taxes. 
  Most of the cures cannot be compared, above all because they 
refer to different timeframes (two, three, five years) within 
which the objective of creating new jobs should be attained. 
<H5>  The Government Plan </H5>
  According to the white paper drafted by Labor Minister Gino 
Giugni, "it is possible to put forward as an hypothesis, for the 
1994-99 five year plan, the objective of an average 3 percent 
annual GDP growth rate. In this way 125,000 jobs would be 
created per year," an increase of 625,000 jobs over five years. 
However, the Labor Ministry sees this measure as totally 
insufficient to guarantee the European employment level 
convergence criteria. Thus, we need to adopt a medium-term 
strategy which aims at a 3 percent GDP increase, a development 
of human resources (raise compulsory school attendance to the 
age of 16, double the number of workers with a high-school 
diploma), an increase of "standardized flexibility" of working 
relations, and promotion of part-time work. This is to be based 
upon the commitments made by the government and the social 
partners in the July 1993 agreement. 
<H5>  Luigi Spaventa's Recipe </H5>
  Budget Minister Spaventa, who is now election candidate on 
the Progressives' list, has focused on resuming public 
investments. In case 30 trillion lire is made available for 
public investments over three years, he claims that 300,000 jobs 
will be created. However, economic growth is only expected to 
be 1 percent a year, not enough to reactivate the job market. 
There is a need for greater flexibility, and forms of "gray 
work" substituting for "black work." Spaventa also proposes a 
substantive reduction in company contributions, which needs to 
be balanced by an "ecological tax," among other things. 
<H5>  Confindustria's Forecasts </H5>
  In December 1993, the employers' federation had calculated 
that if 200 projects were to be released immediately (blocked 
thus far by bureaucracy) 60,000 people would get a job. As for 
the economy in general, Confindustria [General Confederation of 
Italian Industry] has put forward two opposing scenarios for the 
1994-96 timeframe: the forecasts based upon the Ciampi 
government's policy, and those based upon a stricter control of 
inflation and public expenditures. In terms of employment, the 
differences in absolute figures deriving from the second 
scenario compared to the first are 55,000 more in 1994, 140,000 
more in 1995, and 197,000 in 1996. These increases in the 
number of jobs would result from a considerable shifting of 
public expenditures from consumption to investments and from the 
complete elimination of health care contributions for labor, 
which would be financed through indirect taxes. In this case, 
inflation would be lower because the effect of indirect tax 
increases would be more than compensated for by a decrease in 
labor costs and an increase of productivity. 
<H5>  Berlusconi's Promises </H5>
  The provision in Forza Italia's program to create 1 million 
jobs is based upon a series of propositions: lower taxes on new 
hires by reducing the fiscal and social security burden on labor 
costs, and to experiment in areas with high unemployment with 
"complete tax exemptions" for three years, with social security 
reductions for all activities aimed at creating jobs. 
Apprenticeships, professional training, and greater flexibility 
in the standards of the job market are other measures to which 
Berlusconi's job plan appeals.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] We are now going live to our 
colleague Carlos Basto at the Altis Hotel in Lisbon where 
Antonio Guterres has been reelected secretary general of the 
Socialist Party [PS]. Good morning Carlos Basto. 
  [Basto] [passage omitted] The Socialist Party's new National 
Committee has been holding its first meeting here at the Altis 
Hotel. You may recall that this National Committee was elected 
on 25 February, for the first time directly by the party's rank 
and file. This morning the committee has been voting on the 
party's other executive bodies. [passage omitted] The results 
will be announced shortly. There were no competing candidates, 
all the votes were on single consensus lists. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Carlos, perhaps we should point out that this 
new 
scheme of things is the result of changes to the Socialist 
Party's statutes. [passage omitted] 
  [Basto] The congress at which Antonio Guterres was elected 
secretary general was also the party's last congress, insofar as 
it was decided that the party's supreme decisionmaking body 
would henceforth be called the National Convention. This year's 
version will be held in Oporto on 19-20 March. The convention 
is shorn of the dramatics that used to be the hallmark of the 
congresses, what with the bargaining for votes, the last-minute 
candidates, and the back-room negotiations. Under the new rules 
the leadership bodies will have been elected by the time the 
National Convention is held. [passage omitted] Almeida Santos is 
now going to announce the results. 
  [PS Chairman Almeida Santos] [passage omitted] The National 
Political Committee has been elected with 173 votes for, 17 
against, 10 abstentions, 18 blank papers, and one spoiled paper; 
[applause] the National Secretariat has been elected with 173 
votes for, 16 against, 15 abstentions, 13 blank papers, and one 
spoiled paper; [applause] The party chairman has been elected 
with 194 votes for, seven against, three abstentions, 11 blank 
papers, and three spoiled papers. [applause] 
  [Basto] To a standing ovation, Almeida Santos has just 
announced his own reelection as Socialist Party chairman. 
  [Almeida Santos] Finally, the secretary general [party 
leader] has been elected with 210 votes in favor [applause], 
four against, one abstention, and three blank papers. My 
congratulations to elected and electors alike. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller: "Small Party With a Big </F>
Dilemma"] 
  [Text] Once again the Christian People's Party's [KrF] need 
to make its mark has collided with consideration for the "tough 
long haul" in the government. The current conflict concerns the 
Aabenraa Hospital issue -- and illustrates the cool relations 
between the party's group chairman and its political 
spokesperson. 
  The party chairman is irritated. 
  The rank and file are irritated. 
  And the group chairman and the political spokesperson are 
also irritated -- with each other. 
  It is only four months since mutual accusations of 
destroying 
the party's credibility flew through the air. Energy Minister 
Jann Sjursen, the party chairman, had to call a meeting to clear 
the air and make sure that all four group members continued to 
support the government work. 
  The background was a number of special communiques from the 
group's feminine wing, health spokesperson Inger Stilling 
Pedersen and political spokesperson Merethe Due Jensen, who took 
turns locking horns with the government's official position on 
the law regulating store closing hours, child care, elementary 
education, and mental illness. And in so doing they also clashed 
with the group's masculine side, group chairman Henning Lysholm 
Christensen and group secretary Ole M. Nielsen, behind the 
closed doors of the group's conference room. 
  And now there is trouble again. This time it is the 
government's lightning move against the controversial payment 
system at Aabenraa Hospital that has divided the group. To such 
an extent that on Tuesday [8 February] evening the party itself 
considered it necessary to issue a press release on the split. 
  And once more the disagreement draws an invisible line 
between the two women's adjoining offices and the two men's 
adjoining offices on the third floor on Proviantgarden in 
Christiansborg. 
  The men support the proposal. The women oppose it. And at 
the 
same time they do not understand what could lead Nielsen and 
Christensen to change their position in the space of a few hours 
on a hectic Tuesday. 
  The reason can be found in the big difference in their 
attitude toward working methods. 
  And this also illustrates the crucial dilemma in the small 
party, which is more likely to come in below the Folketing 
cutoff barrier in the polls than above it. 
  Despite their declarations of loyalty to the government, 
Merethe Jensen and Inger Pedersen are more preoccupied than 
Nielsen and Christensen with the party's "explanation problem" 
and stressing party viewpoints for the party's many nonsocialist 
voters. Nielsen and Christensen, on the other hand, are more 
inclined to regard achieving results by means of a quiet "tough 
long haul" as a virtue. That is why they did not take long to 
think it over when the prime minister inquired on Tuesday if at 
least two members of the group could support the government's 
legislative intervention -- to avoid an admission of total 
failure. 
  The difference in their views on method is also personified 
by the relations between Jensen and Christensen. The two are 
very seldom seen in each other's offices and it is no secret in 
the party that the "chemistry and communication" between the two 
leave a lot to be desired. 
  Party chairman Sjursen did not want to comment on that. 
However, he was annoyed that they had not managed to stand 
together on the Aabenraa proposal. 
  "That was not smart. We should be able to agree. It is 
particularly annoying because the proposal expresses our party's 
position exactly," the chairman said. And thus implied that the 
group's two women should approve it. 
  But in spite of the wrangling and fear of the coming 
election, none of the KrF politicians disagree on where the 
heavy emphasis should lie in a possible new government base: 
family policy and the right of parents to make free choices 
about child care. The question now is whether an ultimatum will 
be issued. 
  For although no one wants to be quoted as saying so, the 
attitude in the small party is clear: The Center Democrats (CD) 
got something (through the government shakeup, ed.) -- now it is 
our turn.

<F P=106> [Article by Christian Brondum: "Christian Party Conflict </F>
Intensifies"] 
  [Text] Henning Lysholm Christensen, the small government 
party's group chairman, is taking over the important post of 
political spokesman from the rebellious Merethe Due Jensen. 
  Merethe Jensen, the rebellious Christian People's Party 
[KrF] 
member, is now a little freer to present her own viewpoints and 
not necessarily those of the party. 
  Yesterday morning she informed her three totally unprepared 
colleagues in the small government party's Folketing group that 
she no longer wanted to act as political spokesperson. The 
reason is the poor cooperation with group chairman Henning 
Christensen. 
  "For the last six months I have worked to establish a 
fruitful cooperation with the group chairman, but unfortunately 
I must note that the chairman has not shown any desire to 
cooperate with the political spokesperson or any interest in 
doing so," Jensen said. 
  Jensen reached the decision yesterday morning after 
considering it for some time -- and it represents the 
culmination to date of the conflict in the small government 
party, which has earlier concerned store closing hours, the 
intervention against Aabenraa Hospital, Danish participation in 
the Western European Union, and subsidies for housewives who 
stay at home. Inger Stilling Pedersen, the group's other female 
member, threatened to leave the party last fall and makes no 
secret of the fact that she does not support the party's 
participation in Prime Minister Rasmussen's government. 
  The other two members, Ole M. Nielsen and group chairman 
Christensen, on the other hand, have supported the government 
participation more strongly. 
  The group chairman took over the post as political spokesman 
at a special group meeting later yesterday -- without a vote. He 
declined to comment on Jensen's decision but said that in a 
small party it is natural for the same person to act as both 
group chairman and political spokesman.

<F P=106> [Ole Bang Nielsen report: "EU Attempts Once Again To </F>
Resolve Problems Concerning Enlargement -- Fish and Votes"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Today, the EU [European Union] countries 
will make a renewed attempt to reach an agreement with Norway 
regarding its accession to the EU. At the same time, unity must 
be obtained regarding the future size of the blocking minority 
in the EU Council of Ministers. 
  Most people continue to believe that it will succeed. 
However, in the run-up to a meeting between EU foreign 
ministers today there has been considerable uncertainty as to 
whether the EU can untangle the two knots that are continuing to 
block enlargement of the Union to include Sweden, Finland, 
Austria, and Norway as from 1 January next year. 
  The first knot, the fisheries dispute with Norway, appears 
to 
be the easiest to untangle. When the negotiations with Norway 
were broken off last week, it was -- after all -- just cod worth 
less than 40 million kroner that separated Norway from reaching 
an agreement on accession to the EU of the kind already secured 
by Sweden, Finland, and Austria. 
<H5>  "Historical" Fish </H5>
  The key issue continues to be Spain's demand that Norway 
return Spain's "historical" fish. Until 1981, Spain had fishing 
rights in Norwegian waters, and Spain is now demanding a quota 
of cod from Norway if Norway accedes to the EU. Meanwhile, the 
Norwegians are refusing to hand over a single fish. 
  A solution to the dispute lies in so-called paper fish, 
whereby Spain would be given a share of the expected growth in 
Norwegian cod resources, as calculated by marine biologists -- 
on paper, at least. That would satisfy Spain's demand for 
Norwegian fish, while the Norwegian Government would be able to 
say that it had not relinquished any of Norway's current 
resources of fish. 
  A second possibility would be for the EU countries to buy a 
cod quota for Spain from a third country, e.g., Russia or 
Canada. However, this solution is not regarded as satisfactory 
by Spain, which -- for reasons to do with its national 
psychology -- is demanding that Norwegian cod be served at its 
table. 
<H5>  Knot Number Two </H5>
  In any case, an acceptable solution for Spain in the 
confrontation with Norway is still a precondition for being able 
to untangle knot number two in the enlargement process, namely 
the question as to how big the so-called blocking minority in 
the EU Council of Ministers will be. 
  Here, too, it is Spain that is proving uncooperative by 
refusing to allow the threshold for a blocking minority in the 
Council of Ministers to be extended from 23 out of 76 votes to 
27 out of 90 votes in the context of Norwegian, Swedish, 
Finnish, and Austrian accession. However, Spain is being 
strongly backed by the United Kingdom, both countries -- being 
relatively large EU countries -- fearing that they will lose 
their capability of blocking EU legislation if the threshold for 
the blocking minority is not kept at 23. The United Kingdom has 
10 votes and Spain has eight in the EU Council of Ministers. 
Italy has also periodically flirted with the idea of supporting 
this attitude. 
  Meanwhile, Germany, France, and the smaller EU countries are 
insisting that the threshold for the blocking minority in the 
Council of Ministers be adjusted in the context of EU 
enlargement, so that it continues to represent 30 percent of the 
total number of votes, as is currently the case. 
<H5>  German Press </H5>
  Germany is also expected to exert great pressure on Spain 
and 
the United Kingdom today with a view to moving them to drop 
their minority view regarding the number of votes. Otherwise 
there is a risk that the entire enlargement of the EU will be 
delayed when the European Parliament in Strasbourg refuses to 
approve an agreement based on the Hispanic-British model. 
  Spain is expected to cave in to economic pressure to 
relinquish its attitude, partly as a result of the country 
receiving a good fisheries agreement with Norway, and partly as 
a result of Germany -- as the "treasurer" of the EU -- coming up 
with ill-hidden allusions to the renegotiation of EU policy on 
subsidies for Mediterranean agriculture, which will take place 
later this year, where Spain stands to win -- or lose -- large 
amounts of funding. 
  The resistance by the British is of a more political, 
principle-based character. 
  However, as THE FINANCIAL TIMES, among others, pointed out 
in 
an editorial, the United Kingdom has a fundamental interest in 
seeing Austria and the Nordic countries join the Union. 
  At the same time, Prime Minister John Major will not gain 
any 
ground over the Euroskeptic right wing of his Conservative party 
by driving the conflict further toward a possible extra EU 
summit meeting, at which the British would in any case be forced 
to give way, the newspaper points out. According to the 
FINANCIAL TIMES, "stupid Albion," as the paper calls the United 
Kingdom, using a paraphrase of a former French insult referring 
to the British, has certainly made a fool of itself on this 
issue.

  [Text] The Iceland-Lithuania Friendship Society has set up 
a new communications center in Vilnius in the hope of spurring 
commercial activity between Iceland and the Baltic nation. 
  "We have a wealth of opportunity in Lithuania if we go after 
it. But the opportunity is opening up right now and it will be 
much more difficult to enter the market at a later point in 
time," [Reykjavik] MORGUNBLADID quoted the center's founders as 
commenting. 
  Icelanders have been fairly diligent at developing the 
promising Baltic market since they became the first nation to 
recognize Lithuania's independence in 1991. 
  Health firm Islenska Heilsufelagid is on the cusp of 
starting 
up production of pharmaceutical drugs in cooperation with the 
University of Vilnius, while film studio Mydaver Saga is 
producing animated films. 
  In addition, Icelanders and Lithuanians have teamed up in a 
project to breed the Icelandic horse.

<F P=106> [Article by Ingmar Lindmarker: "Russian Talk About Interest </F>
Sphere Worries Sweden"] 
  [Text] The Swedish Government has pointed out by means of 
diplomacy that leading Western powers much too easily accept the 
new Russian talk of interest spheres in Europe. The complaint is 
an element of the careful Swedish monitoring of the political 
development in the former Soviet Union and East and West Europe. 
  On the Swedish side it is stressed that the Western 
democracies should constantly insist that the relations between 
Russia and the weak states that were created after the Soviet 
collapse be governed by international law. 
  "Anything else would be dangerous in view of the often 
fragile national formations," says Lars-Ake Nilsson, under 
secretary of state for foreign affairs at the Foreign Ministry. 
"The major Western powers have accepted the Russian 
interest-sphere thinking a little too easily, something we 
regard as unacceptable." 
<H5>  Believe in Russia </H5>
  Nilsson, who was minister to Moscow for four years and 
ambassador in Prague for three years before being appointed the 
Foreign Ministry's highest spokesman, is commenting after the 
publication of SVENSKA DAGBLADET's series of articles "Uncertain 
East Europe." It has pointed up the fear of East Europeans that 
they might not make it into the West European warmth before a 
new icy Russian chill begins. 
  The under secretary confirms that the principal orientation 
of the Swedish Eastern policy is to build up European security 
not against but with Russia. The essential part is to preserve 
and intensify the democracy that is stumbling ahead in Russia 
and help the Russians push through a policy of economic reform. 
  "It is much too soon to write off the Russian democracy and 
give up all hope that the Russians will somehow succeed in 
getting through all the difficulties," in Lars-Ake Nilsson's 
opinion. "That is the scenario we are pursuing." 
  In a country such as Poland, sharp criticism is being voiced 
against NATO for not already allowing the East and Central 
Europeans in, and a corresponding fear of Russian expansionism. 
Poles and others are talking about appeasement policies toward 
Russia, draw parallels with the 1930's, and find similarities 
between extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and Adolf Hitler. The 
Foreign Ministry's evaluation is that Zhirinovskiy as an actor 
and political phenomenon is both disturbing and unpleasant, but 
that he is already quite busy unmasking himself. 
<H5>  Various Groups </H5>
  "We hope that this will also have a full impact on Russian 
opinion, well ahead of the 1996 presidential election," Nilsson 
says. "Zhirinovskiy's political platform is not monolithic 
either, but consists of various groupings with conflicting 
interests. 
  ``If things should go badly in Russia, which cannot be 
excluded, of course, there is still an opportunity to let the 
Visegrad nations (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary) 
into NATO. The alliance has not closed any doors for the East 
Europeans; on the contrary, it has opened up a way in.'' 
  From a Swedish perspective the new proposal for entry into 
the Western alliance, Partnership for Peace (PFP), is a wise 
decision. If NATO right now had already welcomed membership for 
just the Visegrad nations, the Swedish thinking goes, it could 
have been misinterpreted in Moscow and led to risks for the 
Baltic states. It would have drawn a new line in Europe and not 
favored the Swedish security interests. 
<H5>  Not Underestimate </H5>
  "We must not underestimate the importance of PFP," Lars-Ake 
Nilsson maintains. "This is one step in order to take care of 
the need for greater security that the Visegrad states have. It 
will also develop a network of contacts with the Russian 
military and with the officer hierarchy from the Warsaw Pact, 
which has only been reformed to a limited extent." 
  An initial Swedish PFP agreement will be ready within one or 
a few months, according to the under secretary. He says that it 
is a strong Swedish wish that Russia will join the PFP, which 
President Yeltsin has been said to favor. 
<H5>  Great Confusion </H5>
  The Baltic states occupy a special position in the 
government's Eastern policy, even if Ukraine's exposed position 
is an increasingly disturbing factor. Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt's statement that Sweden cannot be a spectator in the event 
of an attack on any of the Baltic states must be regarded as 
official policy. Pierre Schori, the Social Democrats' foreign 
policy spokesman, also a potential foreign minister if the 
government changes this fall, calls the prime minister's 
position "a peculiar solo trip, which has caused a great deal of 
confusion about the Baltic policy." 
<H5>  Never Indifferent </H5>
  In a so-called policy speech about the Swedish foreign 
policy, Bildt has said, referring to, among other things, the 
Swedish attitude during Finland's Winter War, that "I find it 
difficult to see neutrality as a likely choice for Sweden in the 
conflict cases in our immediate vicinity that we can imagine 
today" and that "we can never stand indifferent before the 
forces that would try to overturn Russia's democracy or seek to 
undermine or crush the independence of the Baltic states." 
  "I have had a major argument with Bildt about the Baltic 
policy in the Foreign Relations Committee," Schori reveals. 
  He also says that he believes the entire Swedish Eastern 
policy to be in disarray. He refers primarily to the use of, or 
failure to use, the foreign aid that could help the East 
Europeans restructure their countries. 
  Other than that, his wordings are very close to those of the 
government side. Pierre Schori regards the PFP (which he prefers 
to abbreviate PFF) as the embryo for all security order in the 
entire Europe. And he, just as Lars-Ake Nilsson, says that it is 
actually more important for the East Europeans to join the EU 
[European Union] than NATO. 
<H5>  Softens the Impression </H5>
  When the PFP was created, Schori seemed to think that Sweden 
could not join unless Russia did. He now softens that impression 
by saying that Sweden should not enter a new security 
organization that excludes the United States and/or Russia. He 
also does not believe that the PFP will "survive" if Russia does 
not join. 
  Pierre Schori does not criticize just the Western powers but 
also the Swedish Government for not having spoken up 
sufficiently clearly about the Russian interest-sphere thinking. 
He talks about "a Russian Monroe policy," which he equates with 
U.S. interventions in Panama and Grenada. 
  "My point," Schori says, "is that superpower politics still 
prevail, even in the era of postcommunism." 
  This is why there is all the more reason for Sweden to stand 
up for the international law.

  [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today said 
that there are indications that the Turkish Cypriot side is 
filibustering the proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures. Replying to a question, Kasoulidhis said this is 
evident from statements by [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas 
that the talks could not take place with such speed. 
Kasoulidhis repeated that our side believes the talks should 
take place at a slow pace but that the timeframe of until the 
end of March is more than long enough for the UN Security 
Council, with the UN secretary general's report, to reach 
conclusions about where the proximity talks are headed.

  [Excerpt] A large quantity of arms (packed in boxes), 
which have not as yet been located by the police, had been sent 
to Cyprus with Bosnia as the final destination. However, when 
the negotiations "failed," the illegal importers attempted to 
channel them in Cyprus to people of the underworld who showed 
interest. 
  According to our sources, this information was conveyed to 
the police, who took action, and last Saturday [12 March] they 
located not only the arms, as the informers had reported, but 
also luxury cars which had been smuggled into Cyprus, and 
antiquities. 
  However, instead of finding arms packed in boxes, the police 
found three briefcases containing various weapons as samples, as 
they had been packed by the factories with the price tags on. 
  After this, the police searched various houses hoping to 
locate a large quantity of arms, as the initial information 
indicated. 
  According to our information, the arms could be coming from 
countries in the Middle East. 
  The new arms discovered in the three briefcases are 
considered to be of high precision and technology. It is also 
noteworthy that some of them are a type used only by the U.S. 
Armed Forces (such as those using laser devices, and so forth). 
  The seriousness of the case is precisely the reason the 
police will intensify their search today and tomorrow to 
establish whether there are actually more arms in addition to 
those found and, if so, to confiscate them before they fall into 
the hands of criminals. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Nigerian plane carrying 23 tons of weapons and 
ammunition from Israel made a forced landing at Larnaca Airport 
last night because of engine failure. The Nigeria Airways plane 
took off from Ashdod Airport [as published] for Lagos, Nigeria. 
A fault was detected in one of its engines as it flew into 
Egyptian airspace. The plane requested permission to land at 
Cairo but the Egyptian authorities rejected it strongly so as 
not to be accused of offering any assistance to the military 
regime. 
  After the Egyptian refusal, the Nigerian pilots applied to 
Larnaca Airport from which they immediately received ... 
[ellipses as published] permission to land. According to our 
information, the repairs that are needed are such that the cargo 
of ammunitions must be unloaded today to avert any danger. A 
strong police force reinforced by MMAD [Mobile Immediate Action 
Unit] men took strict security measures around the plane and 
nobody was allowed to go near it.

  [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: 
Greece's basic position is the survival and development of the 
state of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM]. But Gligorov's government must first give 
specific practical proof. Venizelos made this statement when he 
was asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by Skopjean Assembly 
President Stojan Andov, who claimed that problems exist between 
Macedonia [as heard] and Greece but that he [Andov] does not 
think there are problems between the two peoples. 
  Venizelos noted that Andov wanted to use the term FYROM [as 
heard] by which the United Nations has recognized their state 
and stressed that when the issue is resolved through the 
two-stage process [addressing the issues of the symbol, 
Constitution, and propaganda followed by that of the name], 
Greece will help the neighboring state in a positive way. Andov 
is right. The problem lies with the government, not between the 
peoples. But the problem does not lie with the Greek 
Government; it lies with the Skopjean Government, Venizelos said 
and concluded: Only when Skopje gives the three specific 
proofs--relating to the symbol, Constitution, and propaganda--in 
a dialogue with Greece, which has a known position on the name, 
will we also discuss bilateral economic relations.

<F P=106> [Article by I.K. Pretenderis: "Heirs-Apparent on the Scene"] </F>
  [Text] [Minister of Interior] Akis Tsokhatzopoulos is 
reportedly unhappy with [Minister of Environment] Kostas 
Laliotis, whom many consider a possible candidate for secretary 
general of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party. A 
number of press articles have been "pushing" [Minister of 
National Economy] Yiorgos Yennimatas to the vice presidency of 
the government, while [alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs] 
Theodhoros Pangalos is suddenly concerned with the national 
economy, as he revealed in news interviews. [Minister of 
Industry] Kostas Simitis and [PASOK luminary] Vaso Papandreou 
have "added their two bits" in public talks, while [former PASOK 
Minister of National Economy] Dhimitris Tsovolas has attempted 
the most specific attack yet against the government by (again) 
speaking on the large economic interests which (supposedly) 
direct governmental policy. 
  According to other information, [Minister of National 
Defense] Yerasimos Arsenis is creating his own apparatus, a move 
creating tension with the PASOK leadership. Simultaneously, 
there are some who believe that Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou's entourage is expressing dissatisfaction with the 
defense minister. It should be noted that Papandreou is just an 
observer in the "war of heirs-apparent" and does not take part 
in it, limiting himself to periodically expressing concern 
about, or approval of, one or the other ministers' actions. 
  Nevertheless, it is not coincidental that Laliotis has not 
yet spoken up. Similarly, it is no coincidence that Simitis 
delivered an essentially "programmatic speech" at the..... The 
so-called modernizing wing of PASOK (from which Vaso Papandreou 
should not be excluded) seems ready to "give battle" at the 
PASOK congress on the basis of a "framework of principles 
regarding a whole set of modifications" which, in the view of 
many, government action lacks. 
  Tsovolas' tone is just as strong. He is considered by many 
as 
yet another candidate for the position of secretary general of 
the central committee. It is the second time in a month and a 
half that Tsovolas expresses politico-ideological criticism of 
governmental policy, somehow accusing the government of 
embracing, and speaking for, big economic interests. This is a 
rhetoric that can prove decisive with the audience of the 
congress, all the more so since there seems to be a 
rapprochement between Tsovolas and Arsenis' apparatus. 
  Tsovolas' adversaries within PASOK attribute his sharp 
criticism to his bitterness at not having been appointed 
minister. It is said that this bitterness is aimed especially at 
Yennimatas and Simitis (because, according to this version, they 
refused to entrust Tsovolas with the ministry of economy or 
commerce) and at Tsokhatzopoulos (for more obscure motives). Be 
that as it may, the fact is that Tsovolas is developing a 
rhetoric that may already enjoy support in the PASOK political 
space or will acquire it on the way to the congress.

  The new loss was discovered yesterday during an 
extraordinary 
and detailed accounting of weapons and ammunition of all units 
ordered by Army General Staff (YES) chief Lieutenant General 
Voulgaris, following the theft of the G3 A3 guns from a Larisa 
unit a few days ago. The weapon (G3 A4) was missing from the 
command unit of the 651 AVIP [expansion unknown] located in 
Ayios Stefanos. A sworn investigation was ordered. According to 
YES officials, it is possible that the weapon was stolen long 
ago. 
  It is believed that in December another G3 A4 gun was stolen 
from a unit of the Kavala division. 
  In Larisa, the investigation revealed, among other 
shortcomings, that rules of internal security were not kept.

<F P=106> [Article by Ugur Akinci: "Dual Containment and Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] One of the central tenets of the Clinton 
administration's Middle East policy is the "dual containment" of 
Iraq and Iran. The idea of containment itself is, of course, 
nothing new. First proposed by George F. Kennan back in 1947 -- 
then U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union -- in a Foreign Affairs 
article he wrote under the pseudonym "Mr. X" ("The Sources of 
Soviet Conduct"), the concept of "containment" was originally 
meant to restrain, isolate and ultimately weaken the Soviet 
Union through constant political and economic pressures. 
Containment, for the following 47 years, remained the backbone 
of U.S. foreign policy vis-a-vis the Communist Bloc, all the way 
down to the Reagan administration. The dissolution of the USSR 
in 1989 is regarded by some as the ultimate victory of the 
containment policy. There are many in the conservative camp who 
believe that the tight military containment forced upon the 
Soviet Union by Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) 
program was the straw that broke Moscow's back. But a recent 
study by Richard Ned Lebow and Janice Gross Stein published in 
The Atlantic Monthly (February 1994) suggests otherwise. The 
authors claim that the Soviet Union's defense budget did not 
rise or fall in response to U.S. military spending in the 1980s. 
They think Gorbachev decided to throw in the towel despite the 
Reagan buildup and SDI. Thus, further research seems to be 
needed to ascertain empirically if containment indeed was the 
prime reason why the USSR collapsed, i.e. if containment really 
worked. 
<H5>  Containment Is Out, Dual Containment Is In </H5>
  "Partnership for Peace" has now replaced containment in 
dealing with the new Russian Federation, but the policy of 
containment has reemerged in a new policy area -- the Middle 
East. As first formulated on May 18, 1993 by Martin Indyk, the 
special assistant to President Clinton for Near East and South 
Asian Affairs, in a speech he gave at the Washington Institute 
for Near East Policy, "dual containment" envisions the 
containment of Iran and Iraq simultaneously to secure the chief 
U.S. national interest in the Gulf -- i.e. free flow of oil at a 
reasonable and stable price. 
  One can argue that dual containment is not new either. Ten 
years of war between Iran and Iraq crippled both countries 
simultaneously. And by selling arms to both sides, the United 
States helped Iran and Iraq, in effect, contain each other. 
  Yet, what was a de facto dual containment did not become an 
overt U.S. policy until Iran and Iraq pushed the pause button in 
their war of attrition and turned their lethal attention onto 
their neighbors. In a recent article in Foreign Affairs 
(March/April 1994), Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national 
security advisor, gave the concept his official blessings by 
presenting it as the only realistic way of coping with such 
"backlash states" as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya. 
  "The basic purpose (of dual containment) is to counter the 
hostility of both Baghdad and Tehran," Lake says. "In Saddam 
Husayn's regime, Washington faces an aggressive, modernist, 
secular avarice; in Iran, it is challenged by a theocratic 
regime with a sense of cultural and political destiny and 
abiding antagonism toward the United States.... (Iran) is the 
foremost sponsor of terrorism and assassination worldwide.... 
The most effective message (to Iran) is a consistent one: No 
normal relations until these actions end." 
  Yet dual containment has its own internal contradictions. 
First of all, as pointed out by Professor F. Gregory Gause III 
of Columbia University, the United States paradoxically needs 
Iran's help to contain Iraq and Iraq's help to contain Iran. 
The Shiite opposition groups in Iraq, like al-Da'wah, are 
Iranian time-bombs that can go off if Iraq gets too weak. So 
Iraq cannot be "over contained." But, again, if the power 
balance gets tilted too much against Tehran, then radical 
factions like Hezbollah would get a blank check for stepping up 
terrorist activities and would damage the substantial business 
interests the U.S. oil and aircraft companies (e.g. Boeing) have 
in Iran. 
  The second weak point of this line of thinking, as Indyk 
himself also recognizes, is the fact that dual containment -- 
just like the anti-USSR containment -- has to be "multilateral" 
in nature. The support of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the 
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states is crucial yet 
problematic. GCC states like Bahrain, Qatar and Oman, for 
example, insist that Iraq's territorial integrity must be 
protected at all costs because an unchecked Iran is as great a 
threat for the Arab monarchies as Saddam's tanks. 
  Turkey, in this regard, occupies a curious position on the 
U.S. State Department's chessboard. Turkey by now made it 
abundantly clear that it does not want to contribute to the 
containment of Iraq because the U.N. embargo hurts Ankara more 
than it does Baghdad. 
  Both Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and Deputy Prime Minister 
Murat Karayalcin in their recent visits to Washington made it 
clear that, if it were up to Turkey, it would be back to 
business as usual with Iraq, and that is, of course, not the 
best way to contain anybody. 
  The recent warm overtures made by Iran to Turkey, as 
reported 
in the TURKISH DAILY NEWS by Adnan Caglayan, also makes it clear 
that if the United States wants to contain Iran, seeking 
Ankara's voluntary cooperation is probably not the most 
efficient way to attain it since, for Ankara, stopping the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] is much more vital an issue than 
making sure Tehran or Baghdad never get nuclear weapons -- an 
American concern. 
  In this context, it is curious that the party that 
contributes to the containment of both Iraq and Iran by 
jeopardizing their ties with Turkey is the PKK, which the United 
States officially labeled a terrorist organization. 
  The oil pipeline between Iraq and Turkey that Ciller wants 
to 
keep open, for example, has been sabotaged three times within 
the last six months by the PKK. By turning the buffer border 
zones between Turkey, Iran and Iraq into an uninhabitable 
no-man's-land, the PKK inadvertently created the conditions of 
isolation that contribute to the containment of both Iraq and 
Iran. One can argue that by evacuating over 700 villages in the 
Southeast, the Turkish security forces contributed indirectly to 
the dual containment of Iran and Iraq as well. 
  Washington's "take-no-prisoners" approach toward Baghdad and 
Tehran precludes Turkey from developing normal ties with Iraq 
and Iran. Turkey, spending 6 percent of its Gross National 
Product to combat the PKK (according to official figures), is 
not in a position to champion dual containment by hardening its 
already-fragile relations with Iran and Iraq. But the United 
States can probably do better, especially in the case of Iran. 
  By normalizing its trade relations with Vietnam, and 
continuing to treat China as a Most Favored Nation despite 
China's embarrassing human rights record, the United States has 
already shown that it can be quite pragmatic when it wants to in 
its dealings with adversarial nations. 
  Showing that sort of flexibility will free Turkey's policy 
planners to go ahead with normalizing their relations with both 
Iran and Iraq. Otherwise, the PKK will continue to be 
Washington's best friend in the region, creating an increasingly 
volatile southeastern buffer area that will end up "containing" 
Turkey more than it does Iran or Iraq.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hasan Yalcin from the "Cuneiform Script" </F>
column: "Can They Create More Division Than This?"] 
  [Text] I listened to the impressions of lawyer Nusret 
Senem, who only yesterday returned from a visit to Diyarbakir 
where he attended the court case against our Diyarbakir 
correspondent Ahmet Sumbul, who was detained for simply being 
AYDINLIK's correspondent. 
  Senem particularly stressed that he gathered his impressions 
during extensive meetings with people from Hakkari, Van, and 
many other places. This is what he said in short: "There is no 
election atmosphere or campaigning in most of the southeastern 
provinces." 
  Lawyer Senem's impressions are similar to the ones gathered 
by Mehmet Bedri Gultekin, deputy leader of the Labor Party (IP) 
and candidate for the post of mayor of Diyarbakir, who toured 
Diyarbakir and a number of other cities in the region at around 
the same time. Gultekin told AYDINLIK: "A depressing atmosphere 
prevails in the region. People are afraid to talk about the 
issues. Their primary concern is personal security. Everybody 
is worried if he will be able to return home safely at night. 
The masses have been sidelined from politics; there is no 
debate on choices or any exchange of views." 
  Ostensibly, they [the Turkish authorities] are opposed to 
the 
division of Turkey and, according to their claims, are doing 
their utmost to prevent division. 
  What are they doing? 
  They allocated almost one-sixth of the budget, that is 150 
trillion Turkish lira, to procure arms, cannons, rifles, 
bullets, helicopters, warplanes, and radars. They have 
mortgaged Turkey's budget to the slogan "We will not allow 
division." It is calculated that 20 percentage points of the 70 
percent inflation is due to military spending. 
  The government acted with such devotion that it even threw 
the parliament into flames and reshaped it as the 12 March 
Parliament. 
  The number of yearly unsolved murders stands at 150. The 
counterguerrilla has been given the tools to destroy society's 
moral fabric. 
  The shadow a coup is getting thicker and hangs over the 
regime. 
  And all this is being done to prevent the division of 
Turkey! 
  Result: a geography of empty rural regions and cities with a 
flood of street vendors and people. We now have Diyarbakir, 
Batman, Bismil, and many other cities that are on the verge of 
population explosions and explosions of misery and poverty; we 
have mountains cleaned of villages, people, and forests. 
  How fortunate that they are against division! It is 
fortunate that they have taken so many measures to prevent 
division! Imagine what would have happened had they been 
separatists! 
  It is the free-market policy that is dividing Turkey. We 
have always been defending this truth. We always said that two 
different laws and administrations are in force in the two 
regions [western and eastern] of Turkey. Who can claim anymore 
that the state of emergency regime in the region is simply a 
temporary "emergency" measure? Millions of people have been 
under martial law and the state of emergency for the last 10 
years. 
  To put it figuratively, the existing economy-based division 
creates the same economic contradiction that one would observe 
between Greece and Bangladesh were they placed next to each 
other within the same borders. 
  Now Turkey has entered an election atmosphere. The country's 
western part is vibrant with American-style shows, whereas there 
is no sign of this atmosphere in the east and southeast. "No 
election campaign is going on in most southeastern provinces." 
  Any person traveling from Turkey's west to east could 
clearly 
see the minute-by-minute deepening psychological rift and the 
changing atmosphere. There is no need for further analysis! 
Now, even the elections are divided! There are elections in 
the west and only silence and indifference in the southeast! 
  This is where the emphasis on a policy of violence has 
brought the country. The state can now watch its masterpiece 
with delight and pride.

  [Text] Ankara--The Turkish foreign trade deficit widened by 
61.46 percent to $838 million in January compared to the figures 
of the same period last year, official figures revealed on 
Friday [11 March]. The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) 
disclosed yesterday that Turkish exports rose by 3.4 percent 
while imports jumped by 20.2 percent in the fist month of the 
year. Exports went up slightly from last year's $1.2 million to 
$1.3 billion this year, while imports radically increased from 
$1.7 billion to $2.2 billion this January. 
  The trade deficit, already on a sharp rise since early last 
year, climbed by 61.46 percent from $519 million last January to 
$838 million in the corresponding period this year, according to 
the DIE figures. 
  The economy's export-import ratio declined from 71.1 percent 
last year to 61.1 percent this year in January. 
  The DIE also revealed that Turkish foreign trade volume in 
the same period rose to $3.47 billion from $3.06 billion of last 
January. 
  The Turkish Treasury plans to introduce new export 
incentives 
this month following a further deterioration in its trade 
balance, Treasury officials said on Friday. The new export 
incentive package was signed in Thursday's Cabinet meeting. The 
package will come into effect after receiving presidential 
approval. The new export incentives will include an "export 
return" system for agricultural products, research and 
development incentives for high-technology sectors, state 
participation in the construction of environmental facilities 
and measures for on-the-job training. 
  The Treasury officials also said they had submitted 
proposals 
for new incentives, including energy subsidies to export 
industries, to Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's coalition Cabinet. 
Manufacturers would pay 25 percent less for natural gas, 
liquefied petroleum gas and water. They would also be exempted 
from import taxes and customs duties on fuel oil purchases. An 
overvalued lira and economic recession in Turkey's main trading 
partners have slowed exports since 1990. The 1993 trade deficit 
was $14.08 billion, up 72.6 percent from $8.16 billion in 1992. 
Exports rose 4.3 percent to $15.35 billion and imports 28.7 
percent to $29.43 billion. The export-to-import ratio, a key 
indicator of a country's trade performance, fell to 52.1 percent 
in 1993, the lowest since 1980. 
  "Acceleration of the lira depreciation and new measures will 
show their effects on our exports in coming months. I expect 
exports to hit $17 billion this year," a Treasury official told 
Reuters. DIE figures also disclosed that exports grew in the 
industrial sectors and the agricultural sectors. 
  Industrial exports rose by 0.8 percent in January compared 
to 
last year's corresponding period, while agricultural exports 
rose by a higher 17.4 percent. 
  The largest share in Turkish exports in January again 
belonged to the industrial sectors with $1.04 billion, which 
represents 79.7 percent of the total Turkish exports.

  [Text] Ankara--The Human Rights Association (IHD) reported 
on Monday [7 March] that 16 people held in police custody had 
been killed under mysterious circumstances in Turkey this 
February while 29 people who had allegedly been detained by 
security forces were missing. The IHD, in its monthly report 
for February which was made public Monday, claimed that the 
human rights situation in Turkey is deteriorating rapidly and 
said the country is living through a "human rights disaster." 
According to the report, the government, which came to office 
with the claim that it would legislate democratic reforms and 
improve Turkey's human rights picture, has proven incapable in 
this respect and has lost its credibility. 
  The report said that in February alone 877 people had been 
taken into custody, 18 publications confiscated, three 
associations raided and the Green Party closed down. It said at 
the moment there were 68 journalists and writers being held in 
prison because of their views while nine had been released from 
jail in February. According to pending court cases, journalists 
and writers risk prison sentences of up to a total of 664 months 
and fines in the range of TL [Turkish lira] 1.05 billion. In 
February, journalists and writers had been sentenced to prison 
terms totalling 109 months and were fined TL 1.11 billion. The 
IHD report also claimed that 17 villages in the Southeast had 
been evacuated by force in February. 
  It added that in February, 15 party offices and association 
buildings had been bombed. 
  The IHD also reported that in the last month, there had been 
a total of 39 mystery killings while 34 civilians had been 
killed in various incidents. Police arrested 153 people 
throughout the month. 
  The report also mentioned that three of the people reported 
missing in its January report had been accounted for and were 
under police custody. Criticizing the lifting of the 
parliamentary immunities of eight deputies and their subsequent 
detention, the report said, "You cannot have democracy by 
banishing deputies and silencing the people's rights to express 
themselves." 
  The legitimacy of the upcoming local elections in 
southeastern Turkey was also questioned by the report since the 
pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) has withdrawn from the polls. 
The report also said that the human rights situation in Turkey 
is now reaching crisis proportions and stressed that such a 
situation would not exist in any parliamentary democracy which 
is both a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe.

  [Text] Ankara -- Erdal Kabatepe, the chairman of the 
Turkish-American Businessmen's Association said Wednesday [9 
March] that he and his colleagues had launched a new movement 
called the Liberal Movement. 
  At a press conference, Kabatepe, speaking on behalf of the 
organizing committee, said that the Liberal Movement had been 
created on the grounds that the existing parties and politicians 
had failed to meet the people's expectations. He said that the 
Liberal Movement would complete its organizing by June and would 
establish a party to take part in the first general election 
after that time. he said there was no liberal party in Turkey 
and that no consensus existed between the Liberal Movement and 
the current parties. He stressed that he and his friends had 
launched the new movement in the belief that the ossified 
structures of political parties did not allow them to put their 
principles into practise. 
  Among the principles of the Liberal Movement are the removal 
of the political ban on students and university lecturers 
through an amendment in the Constitution, and holding a 
referendum on the presidential system at the time of the next 
presidential election. Stressing that the terrorism of the 
outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) should be separated from 
the Kurdish problem, the movement's principles urge active 
struggle against terrorism and complete observance of human 
rights. 
  Kabatepe said that the Kurdish issue could be solved through 
"national consensus." Stressing that the terrorists should be 
treated the way they deserved, Kabatepe said that it should not, 
however, be forgotten that those who lived in Turkey's Southeast 
Anatolia region were Turkish citizens. 
  "They also have the right to live in peace like everyone 
else. Dialogue is a must. However dialogue is only meaningful 
in an up- to-date democratic system in which every one is 
represented," he said. 
  He went on to say that he and his colleagues did not think 
that the removal of the legislative immunity of six Kurdish 
based Democracy Party (DEP) deputies and two other independent 
deputies was appropriate. 
  "Freedom of expression should be made a genuine right in 
Turkey," he said. "There should be no need for lifting immunity 
for freely expressed opinions. There should be no difference 
between the members of parliament and the ordinary citizens." 
Emphasizing that the main principle of the Liberal Movement was 
to reduce state interference in the economy to a minimum, 
Kabatepe said that the state should only assume a guiding role. 
  He said while the state should be very active in the fields 
of security, defense, justice and social assistance, it should 
play a lesser role in the fields of infrastructure, education, 
health and social security. He also said that the and his 
colleagues believed in the complete autonomy of the Central 
Bank. Kabatepe claimed that Turkey was missing important 
opportunities to become stronger in a world that would no longer 
have super-powers but where a balance of powers would prevail. 
In this situation, Turkey had a major part to play. 
  He declared that Turkey, which has not yet been accepted 
into 
the European Union, would not become a full member in the near 
future. NATO had entrusted Turkey with the role of "guard" in 
the Middle East, while it remained a mere spectator itself to 
the real danger emerging in the north. Even, he said, it was 
giving its support to Russia's expansionism. 
  He said Turkey should review its policy regarding the Turkic 
republics and reinforce its commercial and economic cooperation 
with those countries. 
  Emphasizing that the new balances in the Middle East should 
be carefully assessed, Kabatepe said Turkey should both 
reinforce its relations with Arab countries and improve its 
commercial ties with Israel, while giving its support to 
international initiatives for peace in the region. 
  Kabatepe said that no one should rely on Turkey becoming a 
member of the EU, but that all efforts should be made to improve 
living standards and democratic rights in the country. As far 
as relations with the United States were concerned, priority 
should be given to economic and commercial cooperation rather 
than to military issues.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7: Coordination Stressed at </F>
Employment Summit"] 
  [Excerpts] Detroit, 14 Mar (ANSA) -- The need to coordinate 
employment policies to combat the common, worldwide problem of 
joblessness was the leitmotif of the addresses made here at the 
opening of the two-day summit on employment between members of 
the Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialised nations. 
  The need to coordinate employment was, in fact, stressed by 
United States President Bill Clinton, in his keynote speech, 
and, later, by Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci, who 
represents Italy at the summit along with Labor Minister Gino 
Giugni. [passage omiited] 
  This theme [cooperation] was reiterated by Italian Treasury 
Minister Barucci who, in his address, agreed that the 
coordination of employment strategies was the only path which 
could be followed. "One cannot just rely on the development of 
world trade," he said, "or only on economic recovery, on the 
progressive liberalization of the job market or only on the 
revision of the welfare state. A blend of these instruments is 
necessary to combat unemployment." 
  "Aside from keeping inflation under control, exchange rates 
stable and fully applying free trade agreements" the treasury 
minister continued, "what is necessary is economic 
decentralization with a growing role for the economy, 
information and an ambitious infrastructure investment program." 
  In full support of the European Commission's white paper on 
employment, Barucci underscored how the problem of coordination 
was not only on an international level, but also on a domestic 
one. "We must commit ourselves to giving coherence to policies 
adopted on a national level," he said. 
  The Italian treasury minister then went on to suggest "A 
coordination authority, which operates with the government chief 
of each nation, could ensure internal coherence and greater 
international cooperation, even by promoting proposals and 
support actions for the part of the OECD," the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development. "To paraphrase a military 
theory" Barucci observed, on an ironic note, "I would say that 
unemployment was much too serious a problem to be left to the 
ministers for the treasury and labor. It is a problem for prime 
ministers." 
  "This conference" Barucci continued, "was organized at the 
right time and with the right mixture of experiences. It has 
forced finance ministers not to just focus on fiscal 
convergences, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. It 
has forced labor ministers to look beyond the pain effects of 
employment." 
  Turning his attention to the effects privatization is having 
on employment, Barucci underlined how "privatization, at least 
in the short-term, will create new unemployment. But its value 
will be relatively modest overall. Europe's objective must be 
to over-turn the ratio between created in the public sector in 
respect to those in the private sector." 
  The Italian treasury minister then reiterated Rome's 
opposition to protectionism and argued how "if world trade 
continues to develop despite the recession, this is because the 
objective of liberalizing trade has been followed up with 
determination both on a multi- lateral level through GATT (the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and through the creation 
of regional organs." 
  The problem of employment, Barucci observed, has so far been 
tackled paying more attention to the creation of jobs rather 
than of working hours. "It is of the utmost importance that new 
employment fully corresponds with the expansion of the market 
which can only be achieved through new productive investments. 
Once new work hours have been created, each country can then 
decide how to best translate this into new jobs." 
  Barucci also stressed the importance of investment in 
workers, in training and research and the need to support small- 
and medium-size business, as done in Northern Italy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Schmidt Will Challenge Elections"] </F>
  [Text] The Liberal Forum (LF) is to challenge the diet 
elections held in Salzburg last Sunday [13 March]. This was 
announced by Federal Spokeswoman Heide Schmidt at a press 
conference in Vienna on Tuesday. 
  She justified this step by pointing out that the principle 
of 
proportional representation, which is set down in the 
Constitution, has been violated. Schmidt thinks the fact that 
in Salzburg about 10 percent of the votes in one constituency 
are required for a basic mandate and thus for entering the diet 
is a distortion of democracy. The LF will challenge the election 
results in Salzburg and, demonstratively, also in the provinces 
of Styria and Carinthia, where there are similarly high 
thresholds. 
  In addition to contesting the elections in the 
Constitutional 
Court, the LF will also petition the Austrian Government to 
challenge the election laws in those provinces where the 
principle of proportional representation is violated. Schmidt 
stressed that her party had already announced its intention to 
challenge the elections before election day and would have done 
so even if it had entered the Diet. 
  Regardless of this challenge, the LF also opposes the way in 
which declarations of support must be presented for a party to 
be permitted to run in elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with SDP leader Rudolf Scharping by Andrea </F>
Tarquini in Bonn on 14 March: "Scharping the Winner Is 
Preparing To Become Chancellor"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Tarquini] Are you confident 
you will become chancellor? 
  [Scharping] This vote [in Lower Saxony] has given us a 
chance. Now the SPD [Social Democratic Party] will have the 
opportunity to build a distinctive and solid leadership for 
Germany. It is a wonderful way to begin the electoral year, an 
excellent result. But we should not rest on our laurels. 
  [Tarquini] [CDU (Christian Democratic Union) leader] Kohl 
might still win, then.... 
  [Scharping] This will be, in any case, the chancellor's last 
electoral campaign, but this does not mean we can take victory 
for granted. We still have a long way to go and must continue 
to work hard; in the next seven months, maintaining the party's 
unity will be a priority task. I repeat, we now have a fair 
chance of becoming the most powerful party in the Bundestag, 
after the general elections on 16 October. It is up to us not 
to miss this chance. 
  [Tarquini] Last Sunday's [13 March] success is not enough, 
then, to bring about a decisive turn? 
  [Scharping] The significance of the vote goes beyond the 
possible fate of my own party. [Lower Saxony SPD leader] 
Schroeder's victory, which is first and foremost his own 
victory, shows that a new opportunity is opening up for Germany; 
namely, that of combating people's weariness vis-a-vis politics. 
If we focus on real problems, on people's needs, then protest 
groups, and above all right-wing extremists, can be stopped. 
This has also been one of the positive results of the tough, 
albeit honest, contest between us and the CDU. 
  [Tarquini] A signal to your opponents? 
  [Scharping] No, but I welcome the fact that, even within the 
CDU, this aspect of their defeat is regarded as a positive 
development in the long run. A figure of 3.7 percent is still 
too high a percentage of the vote for the Republikaner, but for 
the first time their march on a regional parliament has been 
stopped. Against the background of a high turnout, the two major 
parties together have won 80 percent of the vote. The Liberals, 
on the other hand, have fallen victim to their superficial brand 
of liberalism. This is an encouraging result which is worth 
reflecting on. 
  [Tarquini] If you win in October, how will you govern the 
country? 
  [Scharping] We will prioritize the fight against 
unemployment, and developing a strategy for economic growth. 
  [Tarquini] Everybody says this. What concrete solutions do 
you have in mind? 
  [Scharping] Reorganizing work in a more intelligent way, 
with 
shorter and more flexible working hours, for example. We will 
also help carry out the structural reform of our industry, 
particularly those businesses that are more in need of staying 
competitive, and the sectors that are going through difficult 
transitional stages. I am not promising to reduce unemployment 
by half, but reducing it is an imperative task, among other 
reasons, because unemployment benefits are weighing down heavily 
on all taxpayers. 
  [Tarquini] If you become chancellor, will Germany avoid the 
risk of further taxation? 
  [Scharping] We must ease the fiscal burden on investment. In 
this respect we agree with the employers' leaders. This, 
however, has nothing to do with taxing higher-income brackets 
more heavily, which is rendered necessary by fiscal justice. 
Those who can afford to pay 2,000 marks a month in taxes can 
also afford to pay 2,200. Economic recovery is everyone's duty. 
  [Tarquini] What would a left-wing Germany mean for Europe? 
  [Scharping] A more committed European policy, more 
cooperation in the fight against mass unemployment, and a 
greater common commitment to economic growth and the 
strengthening of the European institutions. The foundations of 
foreign policy will not change. There will remain the commitment 
to the integration of East Europe, which is a strategic 
priority, as well as friendship with the United States. It is 
well-known that today Kohl is more isolated than it may seem at 
first glance as far as his Europeanism is concerned. Too many 
within his camp are sounding the nationalist chord without 
realizing just how much they are damaging German, and European, 
interests.

<F P=106> [Josef Joffe commentary: "Jobs and `High Politics'"] </F>
  [Text] Who would have considered making a profane topic 
such as "jobs" the subject of a Western summit -- as happened in 
Detroit at the beginning of this week -- four years ago, let 
alone a decade ago? When Americans and West Europeans met they 
used to discuss "high politics": nonproliferation and 
deterrence, detente and armament. But these problems have 
meanwhile become classical history. What is more: Unemployment, 
health insurance, and immigration have become international 
politics. Why? 
  One reason is that traditional security problems have 
disappeared -- for the time being: There may be many small wars 
going on all over the world, but not a single one of them poses 
a strategic threat to the West. Second, the fate of Western 
governments hardly depends on traditional foreign policy any 
more: Neither Clinton nor Kohl will topple over Bosnia or 
Somalia -- a dramatic contrast to the internal uproar that the 
Vietnam War or the stationing of Pershing produced. 
Unemployment, however, is the most dangerous time bomb ticking 
under the thrones of the powerful -- just remember George Bush, 
the glorious winner of the Gulf War, who was ousted by recession 
20 months later. After all: Even the last backwoods politician 
has now realized that his domestic policy problems -- meaning 
unemployment or immigration -- cannot be solved exclusively 
within the structure of the national state. 
  This is the logic that created the job summit. That not much 
would come of it was predictable, because summits rarely produce 
anything that was not put on paper beforehand in painstaking 
detail. In addition, few of the G-7, the big industrial nations, 
face the same economic situation requiring the same economic 
solution. How, for example, are the highly indebted Germans to 
carry out the economic policy program demanded by Clinton? But 
what is more important than the outcome of the summit is the 
process -- the mere event as such. The G-7 seem to have 
realized -- or they suspect it -- that globalization is taking a 
little more of their autonomy away from them every day and that 
increasingly less can be tackled on a purely national level. 
  Also, worldwide recession -- 36 million unemployed in the 
OECD area, the highest figure since the great depression -- has 
made the arrogance disappear that used to be linked with terms 
such as "model Germany." With 12 percent unemployment in France 
and 10 percent in Germany it is difficult to teach the others 
what is what. But the Americans, who have created 34 million 
new jobs over the last 20 years (the more populous Europe 
produced only 10 million), are no longer very happy with their 
"job machine" either. Very often wages are extremely low, and 
middle-class incomes are stagnating. 
  This has made the two sides willing to learn from one 
another. With their high wages and social contributions (the 
highest in the world), the Germans are condemning more and more 
people to permanent unemployment; at the same time, generous 
social benefits are not a great encouragement for people to look 
for a job. A little more "Americanization" -- fewer subsidies, 
more competition -- would do no harm. The Americans, on the 
other hand, are fascinated by German and Japanese vocational 
training: A week ago, Clinton presented a $3.4 billion program 
to this end. 
  The only question is whether such models are transferable: 
It 
is doubtful whether a young American would work for a meager 
apprentice payment for three years to get his certificate of 
qualification. Another question is whether the German model -- 
it goes back to the Middle Ages -- is still up to date. It may 
work quite well for tradesmen and industrial workers, but most 
of the new jobs are created in the service and information 
sectors. Is an apprenticeship the best way to become a computer 
programmer or marketing manager, for whom creativity is more 
important than trade discipline? After all, young Germans are 
beginning to doubt this method as well, judging from the 
increasing number of students compared with apprentices. 
  And what about the formerly highly praised German managers? 
Many of them cannot leave high-rising hierarchies behind, while 
in America and Japan one middle-management layer after the other 
is cut out of the pyramid. It is worth considering how General 
Motors and Ford could gain market shares in Europe in 1993, 
while total sales of new cars dropped by 15 percent. 
  These are questions that cannot be answered at the summit: 
Show effects are more important than facts there. Nevertheless, 
Clinton must be praised for the initiative because it enhances 
the necessary shift in awareness. "High politics" increasingly 
have to deal with the "darker sides" of social and economic 
policy; at the same time, nobody can escape globalization by 
concentrating on national issues. Detroit has not achieved 
much, but it has shown what the states still have to achieve 
before the turn of the millennium.

  [Text] Paris, March 15 (AFP) -- France Tuesday [15 March] 
welcomed U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to extend a 
moratorium on nuclear tests until September 1995, a spokesman 
for President Francois Mitterrand said. 
  The "decision by the U.S. President is one of the 
consequences of our own decision (to extend a moratorium on 
French testing)," the spokesman said. "We are happy to see that 
this decision is confirmed." 
  "All this moves in a desirable direction at a time when we 
are preparing to discuss the extension of the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty in 1995 and when we have begun talks in 
Geneva on banning nuclear weapons," the source said. 
  The current U.S. moratorium was to run out at the end of 
this 
September.

should keep in mind that the region does not need new tensions. 
Anyway, Venizelos said, Turkey is not the most ideal country 
when it comes to the implementation of UN regulations. The 
spokesman also repeated Greece's firm position against the 
participation in the peacekeeping operations of countries that 
are historically or geographically involved in the problem. The 
spokesman concluded: The framework of Greek foreign policy is 
formulated by the political party leaders' conference under the

leader Alparslan Turkes said today that the separatist terror 
organization PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] was collaborating 
with Armenian terror organization ASALA [Armenian Secret Army

  Speaking at a rally in southeastern Turkey, Turkes said that 
the PKK was receiving foreign support in its terror actions. 
  "The PKK says that it will make Turkey a bloodbath on the 
March 21 Nevruz haliday. It will not be able to do so. 
  ``All of us are brothers, come from the same ancestors. The 
terrorists are trying to force our citizens in east and 
southeastern Turkey to flee to other regions, so as to realize 
their dreams of greater Armenia,'' he said.

  [Excerpt] Vienna, March 16 (AFP) -- Nuclear inspectors met 
Wednesday [16 March] with Hans Blix, the director-general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], to brief him on their 
conclusions following their less than successful trip to North 
Korea. 
  The briefing was to be followed by a meeting of IAEA 
ambassadors who were to consider the findings of their seven-man 
team which was prevented by North Korean officials from fully 
carrying out inspections at seven nuclear sites. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said an emergency meeting of the 
Agency's board of governors could be held later to discuss the 
inspections and possibly refer the matter to the UN Security 
Council. 
  Meyer confirmed earlier reports that North Korea had blocked 
the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but would not 
elaborate on the matter. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Vienna, March 16 (AFP) -- North Korea refused 
IAEA inspectors access to a key nuclear centre suspected of 
producing weapons-grade plutonium, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  "Important measures which had been agreed were refused at 
the 
radio-chemical laboratory in Yongbyon," the IAEA said in a 
statement issued after a March 3-15 trip to North Korea by IAEA 
inspectors. 
  "As a result of this rejection...the Agency was not in a 
position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear 
material at the facility where the relevant measures were 
rejected," it added. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said earlier that the matter could 
possibly be referred to the UN Security Council. 
  Yongbyon, called a "radio-chemical laboratory" by North 
Korea, is one of seven sites that Pyongyang agreed could be 
inspected by the IAEA after months of stalling. The IAEA 
suspects it is used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. 
  The statement was issued after nuclear inspectors briefed 
IAEA chief Hans Blix on their less than successful trip. 
  The briefing was followed by a meeting of IAEA ambassadors 
who considered the findings of the seven-man team, prevented by 
North Korean officials from fully carrying out inspections at 
seven nuclear sites. 
  Meyer earlier also confirmed reports that North Korea 
blocked 
the inspectors from visiting some nuclear sites but refused to 
name them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- Russia will probably 
join NATO's Partnership for Peace plan of military cooperation 
with former communist states by the end of the month, NATO 
sources said Wednesday [16 March]. 
  The announcement eased concern of some NATO officials who 
had 
said Moscow was laying down conditions for joining the program 
for closer contacts between the armies of the former Warsaw Pact 
group and Western forces. 
  Russia's decision was announced to ambassadors of the 
16-country North Atlantic Treaty Organization at a regular 
meeting, the sources said, although no date for Moscow's entry 
was set. 
  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev will travel to Brussels to 
sign Moscow up, the sources said. 
  But even as the sources spoke of military cooperation 
between 
NATO and its former arch-enemy, Russia's defense minister 
insisted in Moscow that Russia was still a power to be reckoned 
with and should not be treated just like any other partner in 
the plan. 
  The U.S.-sponsored initiative offers former Warsaw Pact 
countries military cooperation in training, maneuvers and 
planning as a first step toward full membership at some 
unspecified point in the future. 
  It was devised as a way to help provide the greater security 
sought by these countries and at the same time avoid 
antagonizing the Russian military at a time of growing 
nationalism and volatility in Russia. The program was launched 
in January. 
  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told reporters 
Wednesday in Moscow that Russia welcomed cooperation but not 
integration with NATO and that it would join the Partnership 
"within its own parameters." 
  In order to participate, he said, "other countries in East 
Europe will have to change their armament and the way they train 
their troops. Russia is a huge country with its own military 
technology and its own armament, and cannot be integrated into 
NATO. It can only cooperate." 
  So far 12 former Soviet republics and other former East Bloc 
states have joined the Partnership. The latest is Moldova, 
which joined Wednesday. 
  NATO officials have been concerned in recent weeks by what 
they said were conditions set by Moscow for taking part. 
  The officials said Moscow had been told the plan could not 
be 
modified just to satisfy Russia, but that dialogue with the 
Russians was possible in recognition of the country's military 
importance. 
  Under the plan, participants are entitled to political 
discussions with NATO only when they come under serious threat. 
Grachev has said NATO -- obliged by its charter to defend any 
member in danger -- should not decide on its own on military 
engagement in a hot-spot but rather consult with Russia first.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dutch Battalion Commander: More </F>
People Needed To Complete Tasks in Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Srebrenica -- Netherlands Battalion Commander 
Lieutenant Colonel Vermeulen seriously questions the rationale 
of the deployment of Netherlands UN units in Bosnia. 
  The Netherlands infantry battalion in Bosnia is to dispatch 
for a temporary time a company to the northern part of the war 
zone to assist Scandinavian blue helmets. 
  Over 100 Netherlands UN troops will be quartered at Tuzla 
airport for a couple of weeks and around 20 people will be 
stationed near Srebrenica in the north. 
  Vermeulen has one company -- the Bravo Company -- in 
Srebrenica, which, in his opinion, is not enough to do its work 
properly. The Netherlands battalion originally was to have 
deployed two companies to Srebrenica and one to the nearby 
enclave of Zepa. In that village the Ukrainian UN troops are 
expected to extend their stay. 
  Vermeulen says: "Bravo Company has to make a great effort to 
perform its assigned security and observation tasks." In his 
opinion, a second company is needed to relieve patrols and 
checkpoints more regularly. In addition, the situation around 
Zepa remains very tense. Therefore, Vermeulen plans to increase 
the number of observation points. 
  The Scandinavian battalion is responsible for large parts of 
northern and eastern Bosnia. In this area there are various 
places where General Rose wants to eliminate the transportation 
problems. 
  The official decision to change part of the Netherlands 
battalion's location still has not been made, but General Rose's 
order is expected any day now. 
  The reopening of Tuzla Airport is vital to provide 
humanitarian aid, and it also should solve the problems of 
ensuring provisions to the Netherland battalion. Right now, the 
Dutch have to use a long and heavily used road to transport 
provisions from Split, Croatia to eastern Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Report by Christopher Lockwood: "How the EC's Majority </F>
Vote System Works"] 
  [Text] The Battle over voting rights at the EC Council of 
Ministers that was joined yesterday goes to the heart of the way 
Europe works and the way it will develop. 
  Failure by Mr Hurd to prevail would set the stage for 
Britain's influence to grow ever more marginal. It is, in fact, 
a desperate struggle to preserve what remains of British 
sovereignty in an ever-expanding Community. 
  Since 1987, when Mrs Thatcher signed the Single European Act 
which first made it possible for Britain to be out-voted, the 
majority of EC decisions have been taken on the basis of 
Qualified Majority Voting (QMV). 
  Major issues -- such as taxation, budgets and foreign policy 
-- are still taken by unanimous vote. But lesser decisions, 
such as permitted food colourings, maximum working hours, water 
quality or the fitting of catalytic converters, are all taken by 
QMV, the scope of which was greatly extended by Maastricht. 
  Each country has a number of votes very approximately 
determined by its population, the big countries getting 10 
votes, and the smallest, Luxembourg, only two. 
  To prevent large countries dominating completely, QMV gives 
the small countries more votes than their population merited. 
So Britain has one vote per 5.6 million people, while Ireland 
has one per 1.1 million. 
  With 12 EC members there are 76 votes. To pass a directive 
requires a qualified majority of 54 votes -- 70 percent. So 23 
votes constitutes a "blocking minority." 
  Yesterday's arguments which were suspended last night after 
10 hours, arose because the entry of Austria, Finland, Norway 
and Sweden, planned for 1995, will raise the total number of 
votes to 90. The dispute was where to set the blocking minority. 
  Everyone except Britain and Spain wants to move it to 27, 
thus keeping it at 30 percent, because of a fear that retaining 
it at 23, which would be 25 percent of the votes, would lead to 
more decisions being deadlocked. 
  Britain argues holding the blocking minority at 23 is vital 
to reverse the erosion of the large countries' voting shares 
brought about by the entry of small countries. Raise the 
minority to 27, Mr Hurd says, and it becomes possible for 
countries with 41 percent of the EC's population to be outvoted. 
  If that argument were as strong as Mr Hurd claims, France 
and 
Germany would be behind him. But they are not. It is only the 
British who want the EC to slow down: the rest of the Community 
believes in pressing ahead. 
  Mr Hurd's strongest argument is that Westminster may refuse 
to ratify the enlargement treaty, which needs to be approved by 
all 12 members and the European Parliament if the minority is 
raised to 27. However, if Britain holds the minority to 23 the 
European parliament might throw it out. 
  Were Britain to climb down now, the effect on Conservative 
morale in the run-up to June's elections would be catastrophic. 
At a stroke, Mr Hurd's attempt to draw a line in the sand 
against further "deepening" of the EC would be invalidated. 
  Britain would also set a bad precedent for 1996, when an 
inter-government conference is to review the entire 
institutional framework of the EC, with a view to letting 
eastern Europe countries join the EC over the following 10 years. 
  As the row wears on, the procedures for incorporating the 
four new members are held in limbo. This can hardly endear 
their electorates, who have to approve entry by referendum, to 
the Brussels way of doing things. 
  Compromises litter the conference tables in Brussels. Mr 
Hurd said yesterday none was acceptable, presumably including a 
Spanish one which would set the blocking minority at 27 in 
general and at 23 where three countries could muster that 
number. None of the other members like Madrid's solution either.

<F P=106> [By Sarah Womack and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F>
political staff] 
  [Excerpt] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was tonight 
walking a tightrope over enlarging the European Union [EU] that 
could spark more internal warfare in the Tory Party. He faced 
the tricky dilemma of maintaining Britain's voting powers to 
block EU legislation while not threatening the enlargement 
process, which Britain backs. 
  He was applauded by Tory backbenchers at a private meeting 
in 
the Commons tonight after returning from Brussels, where he and 
fellow foreign ministers reached deadlock after 10 hours of 
bitter talks. 
  Britain is refusing to budge from the present position where 
23 votes (from the 76 available among the 12 member states) can 
block Brussels legislation. All the other countries -- except 
Spain -- say that with the addition of Finland, Austria, Norway 
and Sweden, that figure should increase to 27 from the 90 votes 
then available. 
  Negotiations will resume in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March] 
-- 
with the prospect of one of the biggest Euro-rows blowing up for 
years. 
  But Mr Hurd warned Tory MPs that delay could threaten 
Community enlargement, which Britain champions. 
  Equally any weakening of Britain's position could create 
fresh Tory strife which could have a calamitous effect on the 
party's showing at the June Euro-elections. 
  Mr Hurd bluntly told the MPs that enlargement was something 
they had worked for for many years and for very good national 
reasons. "This is the kind of Europe we want," he said. "It 
clearly would not be sensible to scrap that policy just when it 
had succeeded. We are not prepared to accept an automatic 
mechanical upgrading of the qualifying majority from 23 to 27." 
  But he warned them that to delay enlargement indefinitely 
could risk the collapse of the enterprise. 
  Mr Hurd told his colleagues, at the meeting which lasted 
more 
than an hour, that he did not want to get into details of the 
ideas coming forward. But he declared: "I have not shifted at 
all." 
  Even so, MPs expect the days between now and Tuesday to be 
occupied with attempts at compromise -- without, in the words of 
one Tory Euro-dissident, "selling Britain down the river." 
  There were, Mr Hurd told MPs, people "trying to breach the 
gap." 
  Meanwhile, Tory Euro-rebels -- who caused such havoc during 
the Parliamentary passage of the Maastricht legislation -- are 
tonight standing four-square behind Mr Hurd. But the growing 
fear among Tory business managers is that if Britain is forced 
to compromise and weaken her position, the Euro-storm will flare 
up uncontrollably again. 
  Mr Hurd, however, has told colleagues since the meeting that 
when he said that support was what he needed, it was forthcoming 
"beyond the ordinary." His clear message was: "We will just go 
on until we get there." 
  But he remained tight-lipped about his tactics, saying that 
he was in the middle of difficult and delicate negotiations. 
Plainly he did not wish to expose his hand to his opponents 
ahead of the next Brussels encounter. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Bonn, March 17 (AFP) -- The German Foreign 
Ministry, in a highly unusual move, summoned Thursday [17 March] 
the French ambassador for critical remarks on German foreign 
policy amid signs of strain in the Franco-German partnership. 
  The German move also comes amid controversy over whether 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl should have been invited to D-Day 
celebrations in France marking the 50th anniversary of the 
wartime Allied landing. 
  Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts gave no reason for 
the summons, but the order for it was reported to have come 
directly from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, said to have been 
extremely irritated by ambassador Francois Scheer's remarks. 
  The office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl also indicated that the 
French ambassador's remarks were considered out of order and 
demanded an explanation. [passage omitted] 
  Sources close to the French ambassador told AFP after the 
meeting that he felt his remarks had been reported selectively, 
but that he maintained that relations between the two 
governments needed to be improved. 
  Scheer was said to want to remind the united Germany that it 
was anchored to West Europe. Bonn is suspected of wanting to 
push for expansion of the European Union toward East Europe. 
  In his original remarks, Scheer reportedly also expressed 
the 
view that not so much France but other, smaller countries of the 
European Union distrusted the German attitude in Europe, and 
that D-Day was just one issue. 
  Both German and French diplomatic sources said the present 
row would be dealt with further at ministerial level later 
Thursday. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernt Conrad: "Disturbed Relationship"] </F>
  [Text] The formerly smooth Franco-German cooperation has 
been disturbed. Bonn's irritation at the fact that Helmut Kohl 
has not been invited to the victory celebrations in Normandy and 
ill-feelings in Paris regarding the fact that the allied troops 
in Berlin will be sent off without a parade, are symptoms of 
disrupted communication. 
  This is particularly disadvantageous in view of the latent 
insecurity about the new role of the united Germany that can be 
felt among our Western neighbors. Will Germany's regained 
central position change anything about the Western orientation 
in our foreign policy, particularly about the Franco-German 
friendship as the European axis? 
  One ought to discuss these things openly with our neighbors 
on the Seine. Yet, despite the general assertions by the 
federal chancellor, this is obviously virtually not being done. 
  Yet, as one expert on French politics stated, the 
Franco-German friendship is not a natural river, the course of 
which can be neglected. It has to be cultivated. 
  The extension of the European Union [EU] toward the east, 
the 
position toward Russia, containment of the conflict in the 
Balkans, and, in particular, the restructuring of the 
decisionmaking process in the EU, which will be enlarged by the 
EFTA [European Free Trade Association] states, requires a 
Franco-German relationship that is intact. Only when Paris and 
Bonn/Berlin continue to stand trustfully side by side, will it 
be possible to ban the many specters of the past that are 
darting in and out again.

  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- During his testimony to the 
first criminal division of Berlin Regional Court today, Bernd 
Schmidbauer, state minister at the German Chancellery, said that 
an attempt was made to prevent the trial surrounding the attack 
that took place at the Mykonos restaurant. Schmidbauer said 
Iranian Intelligence Minister 'Ali Fallahian had made this 
unreasonable request to him during talks in October 1993. 
Schmidbauer, who is responsible for secret service 
coordination, therefore confirmed the talks with Fallahian, 
which he had previously disputed, on the background to an attack 
on 17 September 1992 during a Socialist International congress, 
in which four exiled Iranian politicians were murdered. 
  During persistent questioning Schmidbauer said he had 
categorically rejected the Iranian's proposal as it was the job 
of independent judges in Berlin to rule on the case. He had 
also said there would be a period of frosty relations between 
the two states if it emerged that Iran was behind the attack. 
The case continues.

<F P=106> [Nevenka Mitrevska report: "Europe Must Not By-Pass the </F>
Balkans"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 15 Mar -- "The Balkans today is a European 
anachronism, burdened with the consequences of postcommunism, 
with the war problem in the region, but also with repetitions of 
the Cold War. A part of the relations among the Balkan 
countries is far from today's European reality, burdened with 
historical motives, frustrations, and striving to be the top 
state. Because of all that it is necessary to Europeanize the 
Balkans with a specific European project. By contrast, the 
threat of the Balkanization of the other European regions is not 
to be underestimated." 
<H5>  A Working Visit With All Official Elements </H5>
  This is what, among other things, President Kiro Gligorov of 
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] stated in his 
address to about a hundred politicians, ambassadors, and 
journalists, at the rally called "Europe-Dialogue" that is being 
held in Bonn for the third time. The subject of this year's 
meeting was "The road to Europe -- too many conflicts." Its 
participants, among whom were President Gligorov and Slovene 
President Milan Kucan, tried to contribute by explaining their 
own perspectives, geopolitical positions, and the development of 
their own states, to find the roads leading to further 
development of Europe, which has been meandering about in the 
effort to shape its role, and place, after the fall of the 
Berlin Wall and the disappearance of the bloc division. 
  President Kiro Gligorov arrived in Germany last night, at 
the 
invitation of the Europe-Dialogue Association, chaired by Madame 
Rita Suessmuth, president of the German Bundestag. By its 
nature, the visit is in the category of so-called working 
visits. However the hosts did their best to give it all the 
elements of an official state visit. This afternoon President 
Gligorov had a 45-minute talk with German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker. For tomorrow morning, meetings and discussions 
with Minister-President Johannes Rau and Wolfgang Clement, head 
of the State Office of the Federal State of North 
Rhine-Westphalia, to which Bonn belongs, are planned. On 
Thursday [17 March], the last day of the visit, President 
Gligorov will have a meeting with Klaus Kinkel, federal vice 
chancellor, in charge of all the foreign political activities in 
this preelection period in Germany, since Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
is fully engaged in domestic affairs. 
  Aside from these three central meetings, the program for 
President Gligorov comprises a series of contacts with the 
leaders of the more important parties in the country, with the 
Macedonians living and working in Germany, as well as a tour of 
the sights in Bonn, and so on. 
<H5>  Danger of a New European Division </H5>
  The subject of today's rally only seemingly limited the 
issues under debate. The conflict in Bosnia and the danger of 
its spreading to the southern Balkans is definitely the most 
difficult conflict, but not the only one faced by Europe on the 
eve of the new millennium. Freed from the old balance resulting 
from the fear generated by the blocs, Europe does not have a 
clear vision of how to harmonize and neutralize the other 
conflicts that are erupting or threatening to erupt: the ethnic 
resurgence and desire for emancipation; the unequal degree to 
which the new states are developed economically, democratically, 
and judicially; the incongruous spiritual and cultural values 
that more or less endanger the civilized achievements of the 
European Union. Does the European Union have to transform 
itself and be selective and cautious in opening itself only to 
the most successful? Do the countries of Central and southern 
Europe have to organize themselves into a second Europe, and 
Russia into a third -- para-Europe, because the European Union 
is closed? In other words, do the old divisions have to be 
replaced by new ones, and can Europe embark on the new century 
with three or more gears, without it having an impact on the 
stabilization and prosperity of the whole continent, including 
its most developed part? The hosts wanted to hear the opinions 
of their guests, President Kiro Gligorov and President Milan 
Kucan, from the south of Europe. The Slovene President hastened 
to say that Slovenia was not the Balkans, that it was 
geographically, culturally, and spiritually attached to Central 
Europe. Therefore, its wish to be integrated in the European 
Union was legitimate. President Gligorov replied that, 
"contrary to Slovenia, FYROM is in the Balkans, like Greece, 
which is already a member of the European Union, and the Balkans 
is a part of Europe. The geographical position cannot be a 
criterion for including or leaving a country out of the European 
integrating movements. There certainly should be criteria, but 
they should be sought in the degree of true European orientation 
of each country, in its democratic development, in the 
promptness with which it applies the principles of civilization 
acceptable for Europe. In doing so, some countries will 
certainly enter Europe sooner, but others, like FYROM, will 
perhaps need 10 to 15 years. Nevertheless it is important to 
keep the road to Europe open to all countries." 
<H5>  How Can Europe Help </H5>
  How can developed Europe, that is the European Union, help 
in 
the settlement of conflicts like the war in Bosnia, or the 
FYROM-Greek dispute, which are direct or indirect threats to its 
stability and prosperity? "Europe has clear-cut principles in 
the Helsinki documents, and it will do its best to implement 
them," President Kiro Gligorov said. "Those principles, for 
instance the regulation on not changing borders by force, cannot 
be taken pragmatically, as has been the case with Bosnia, 
starting from the wrong premise that Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
an artificial creation. The territories of this republic never 
belonged to the Serbian or the Croat state. Bosnia existed as a 
separate entity during the Turkish Empire and also later on, 
under Austria and Hungary. Only after the promotion of the 
thesis `all Serbs in one state,' or `all Croats in one state,' 
did the Muslim population living there turn to a goal it never 
sought in the past -- to the formation of its own Muslim state. 
  ``The division of Bosnia and Herzegovina will lead nowhere 
and solve nothing. It will just represent a precedent in which 
Europe will open up the possibility for the Balkanization of new 
European regions, that is, for changing borders by force, for 
new ethnic cleansing and bloodshed. 
  ``Europe can also solve the FYROM-Greek dispute by a 
consistent implementation of its principles. Thus, it will 
encourage both sides to implement the same principles in their 
mutual relations. This means all problems should be brought to 
the negotiating table and an attempt be made to try and solve 
them through civilized dialogue. I am convinced we can find 
solutions for all the questions burdening our relations through 
dialogue. However, those solutions must come as a result of 
discussion, of an agreement, of mutual compromises -- without 
ultimatums and pressures, without previous conditions.''

  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Hans-Peter Stihl, president of 
the German Association of Chambers of Industry and Commerce, has 
reaffirmed German industry's hope for a continuation of the 
liberal-conservative coalition between the Christian Democratic 
Union, Christian Social Union, and the Free Democrats. A 
red-green government following the Bundestag election in October 
is "not a desirable alternative," Stihl told journalists in 
Munich today. 
  Stihl told the DDP/ADN news agency that industry also 
rejects 
the idea of a social democratic-liberal coalition involving the 
Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Free Democratic Party, as 
the left wing of the SPD is pursuing a policy hostile toward 
industry and which threatens jobs. His skepticism toward a 
change of government was shared by Klaus Murmann, president of 
the Federal Confederation of German Employers' Associations, 
Tyll Necker of the Federal Association of German Industry, as 
well as Herbert Spaeth of the National Association of German 
Skilled Crafts. 
  The industrialists met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the 
"top-level Munich talks of German industry."

<F P=106> [Martin S. Lambeck report: "Rexrodt Becoming Target of FDP </F>
Criticism"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- After the lost Lower Saxony elections, 
criticism of Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt is increasing 
within the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. The party's 
leading circles complain that Rexrodt has not done enough to 
improve the FDP's profile in his department. They say that the 
words that FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel said after the election 
defeat, "We simply have to get better," were directed at him. 
  The FDP management says: "Rexrodt should finally show that 
he is not only a minister in the federal government, but also an 
FDP politician." The economics minister was criticized by 
Honorary Chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Deputy Chairwoman 
Irmgard Schwaetzer, and former Interior Minister Gerhart Rudolf 
Baum. After all, the economy is a central issue in the 1994 
super election year. Rexrodt has given in to the Christian 
Democratic Union [CDU] in the back room of the coalition too 
often. It has to become obvious that the FDP stands for more 
jobs in the coalition. According to information available to 
DIE WELT, Kinkel personally demanded: "We need a more 
aggressive economic policy." 
  On the FDP's reliability as coalition partner, leadership 
circles say: "We are not a party of people wanting to commit 
political suicide." A shift of the Liberals is practically 
impossible at this point. In Monday's [14 March] management 
meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer said: "A coalition 
decision is not a single decision, but a process." 
  What is striking in this context is the restraint shown by 
North Rhine-Westphalian FDP chairman and Kinkel opponent Juergen 
Moellemann. In the 23 May Federal Assembly, Moellemann wants to 
vote for Social Democrat Johannes Rau. Moellemann does not want 
to use the crushing defeat in the Lower Saxony elections against 
Kinkel. The reason: At the Rostock party conference in June, 
Moellemann wants to take the place of Carola von Braun, who 
retired from the presidium. 
  The FDP is concerned about its weak position in the laender 
organizations. The Liberals must be prevented from becoming a 
mere federal party. They say: "The Liberals must not become a 
woman without reproductive organs."

<F P=106> [Article by Stefan Kornelius: "A Man With Hidden Qualities; </F>
the Often Defensive Party Strategist Has Come Under Fire From 
the Ranks of a Union Which Fears Its Election Year Hopes Will Be 
Dashed"] 
  [Text] Neu Wulmstorf, 13 Feb--Just beyond the Black 
Mountains and just this side of the New Land lies the tiny 
village of Neu Wulmstorf. This evening, in its community center 
with adjoining rathskeller, the general secretary of the 
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is speaking before 100 people. 
And Peter Hintze was lucky to be able to do so because the local 
CDU meeting faced stiff competition from the general membership 
meeting of the gun club. The residents of Neu Wulmstorf came 
nonetheless, though the average age of the audience must have 
been a good bit over 50--these days by no means an unusual 
phenomenon for CDU gatherings. Here he stands then, the 
43-year-old general secretary who is, after all, still nine 
years older than Christian Wulff, the leading candidate of the 
Lower Saxony CDU, whose election campaign Hintze wants to help. 
One female visitor utters an involuntary sigh over his youth 
before Hintze begins to speak and attempts to break down the 
northern Germans' brittle reserve--a difficult problem for 
someone who does not want to phrase things too aggressively or 
in a recklessly exaggerated manner. At least the smile has 
disappeared from the corners of his mouth at the end of a long 
day of election campaigning, which gives the appearance of a 
little more credibility when the subject is unemployment or the 
war in Bosnia. 
<H5>  The Game Behind the Game </H5>
  To put it briefly: All in all, the arguments were 
convincing, 
the appearance was a success though not an overwhelming one, the 
applause was friendly and brief. That is the way it is with 
Peter Hintze, and it would certainly be a plus for the 
credibility of politics if the man, like an itinerant preacher, 
were able to appear at thousands of these meetings and campaign 
for his cause in tenacious detail work. Pastor Hintze is, 
however, not an itinerant preacher but rather the general 
secretary of the CDU, which is why he cannot constantly travel 
about the country but really must be the big spokesman in 
Bonn--or, as a confidant puts it: "We do not need the light 
cavalry on the flank but the heavy artillery in the center." 
  In the meantime, to be sure, the bombardment has begun and 
the general secretary has discovered that he himself, as 
military people say, has come under friendly 
fire--under fire from his own ranks. The difference, of 
course, is that Hintze has been purposely chosen as a target, as 
the whipping boy for a battered government, as a scapegoat for a 
party that has come down in the world. Displeasure over sobering 
public opinion figures, over lethargic and discouraged party 
loyalists, over the loss of the political leadership role, and 
over the lack of success is focused on Hintze. The CDU is 
seizing upon its general secretary in a prophylactic move, as it 
were, to explain the election defeat that appears to be evermore 
ominous. The general secretary, on the other hand, lacks the 
political weight and power to defend himself against the 
cannonade and to thwart the game behind the game. And it is for 
this reason that the case of Hintze is so typical of the 
condition of the CDU, riven as it is by internal conflict and 
where--if one only looks a bit more closely--a huge power 
struggle for the legacy of Helmut Kohl is beginning to break out 
and where any unanimity appears to be lost. 
  What then is the situation with general secretary and the 
game behind the game? Peter Hintze was put into office at a time 
when the Union appeared to have a lightweight opponent in the 
Social Democrats. The Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) 
was providing its own headlines and its leadership team was more 
than preoccupied with itself. At the time--on 25 April 1992 to 
be exact, which is also Hintze's birthday--on that day then, 
Helmut Kohl invested State Secretary Peter Hintze with the 
office of the general secretary in a four-hour speech in 
Oggersheim. It is no secret that Hintze was not his first 
choice--Hans-Peter Repnik, state secretary in the Ministry for 
Economic Cooperation, and Juergen Ruettgers, secretary of the 
parliamentary caucus, had already declined. Hintze accepted 
because, as he himself says, he had the choice between a 
tranquil life in the Ministry for Women and Youth or the 
kamikaze job in the Adenauer House. 
  Hintze took office under difficult circumstances: The CDU's 
opinion poll results were no better than today and the 
leadership team at party headquarters had been completely 
replaced. Only two years before the great election marathon, 
Hintze had to do without an experienced team and start all over 
again from the beginning with a young crew. Within the power 
structure, the Adenauer House increasingly declined in 
importance in relationship to the Chancellor's Office, the 
caucus, and the party because Hintze also had to put internal 
conditions in order during his first year and did not use the 
time to achieve greater importance for his house in its external 
relations. More important, however, was the fact that the Union 
caucus, with Wolfgang Schaeuble at its head, developed a 
powerful dynamism that literally bowled over the young general 
secretary and his even younger team. 
  Hintze assumed the new office although he knew he lacked 
political prominence. All of his predecessors had a field of 
technical expertise in which they had been able to shine: Kurt 
Biedenkopf as an economics expert, Heiner Geissler as a 
specialist in social issues, and Volker Ruehe as a policy expert 
in foreign affairs and defense. Hintze, on the other hand, was 
aware of the fact that no laurels were to be won with the issues 
of women and youth, which were considered soft in Bonn, or even 
with his experience as expert for civilian service [for 
conscientious objectors]. 
  He therefore concentrated on the CDU's renewal--an 
undertaking that, to be sure, succeeded in the Adenauer House, 
but failed miserably in the party. The CDU is, surveys show, 
unattractive to young people. The connection to voters under the 
age of 40 has been broken. Again and again Hintze tried to seize 
upon issues and promote them--thus far without success. It was 
more by accident that his initiative to liberalize business 
hours gained momentum during last summer's legislative break, 
yet the chancellor, who had apparently underestimated the 
dynamics of it, jumped from the train at the last minute and 
left Hintze in the lurch. Hintze's successes in containing the 
tax debate following the Duesseldorf party convention, for 
example, or in the coalition fight over the AWACS deployment, 
found no resonance with the public. Finally, the classic issue 
for a general secretary--reform of the party and making it more 
accessible, has long been taken over by Parliamentary Caucus 
Secretary Ruettgers. 
  Hintze thus remained a strangely colorless figure and his 
initiatives turned out rather ridiculous--such as the 
demonstration he organized for nursing care insurance in front 
of SPD headquarters where, in the manner of a Young Union [CDU 
youth organization] project, he put up posters and allowed the 
event to be taken over by SPD National Secretary Verheugen. 
There is always something timid and immature about Hintze's 
public appearances which has gained him the reputation of an 
earnest schoolboy--not least of all because of his youthful 
appearance. He acts stiff and defensive before the cameras, with 
a mixture of studied aggressiveness and lecturing 
paternalism--both of which come across as disingenuous and 
artificial. His news conferences often go awry and his 
statements are characterized by toothless sarcasms. 
  And now comes the astonishing aspect: There is also a 
different Peter Hintze. There is a perceptive analyst, a 
polished wordsmith, and an aggressive fighter. There is a 
general secretary with firm views on the condition of his party 
and precise plans for its recovery. There is an election 
campaign manager with a keen understanding of the modern media 
campaign, of the needs of the younger voter groups, and of the 
limitations and potential of using party VIP's. There is the CDU 
politician Peter Hintze who is thoroughly aware of his role, who 
keenly observes what is happening around him and to him, and who 
reports on the chaotic forces with which he has to struggle 
every day in order to keep the CDU juggernaut on track while at 
the same time having to contend with intrigues, feuds, and 
treacheries. And because the man can speak so objectively about 
himself, one very quickly comes to the second biggest problem 
that, in addition to his lack of political prominence, plays a 
role: the discrepancy between the public perception of Peter 
Hintze and his real personality. It is simply a case of Hintze 
having a serious problem of self-presentation, of him sharing 
with his party chairman a shyness in front of the camera, and of 
basically performing two roles. 
  Now that the election campaign is drawing nearer, they are 
all jumping on him and demanding an aggressive and polemical 
general secretary. In the laender party associations, in the 
ministries, and even in the Chancellor's Office the call is 
heard for the big stick and for the bulldog--a role Heiner 
Geissler and Volker Ruehe once performed. "Ruehe certainly was 
considered a crude guy, but he was effective," says a member of 
the leadership rank. The party is thirsting for arguments, it is 
demanding guidelines for the campaign, and it wants to know how 
the CDU can once again tackle the job. For the time being, 
Hintze cannot provide an answer--but who can in a Union where 
resignation is everywhere rampant? Thus, they attack the general 
secretary's methods: the computer network he had installed to 
provide information to the kreis offices; the Adenauer House's 
work with the press; the lamentable appearances at podiums in 
front of colorful signs--all symbolism and not strategy, 
activity for the sake of activity instead of content. Last week 
the chancellor appointed journalist Peter Boenisch as special 
advisor for the election campaign as he has done in previous 
years as well, and although the man will not have any strategic 
assignment and his true role cannot yet be properly assessed, 
this is now being interpreted as a blow to Hintze. 
<H5>  Like a Reed? </H5>
  Lost amid all this turmoil and carnage is the fact that 
Helmut Kohl knew perfectly well two years ago who he was 
bringing into the Adenauer House. He knew that Hintze prefers 
softer tones, that this general secretary would bring a new 
style--friendly, objective, and not polemic. Furthermore, if one 
assumes that Helmut Kohl continues to stand by Hintze, that a 
change of general secretary would damage the chancellor himself 
more than it would help him, and that a successor will also not 
be able to change the downward trend, then the question is 
raised as to the purpose of this crusade. Is someone--if it may 
be put this way--beating the sack instead of the donkey? Is the 
party's displeasure with its chairman being taken out on its 
general secretary? But the explanation is also reasonable--and 
one can hear it at many levels of the party--that a serious 
struggle has set in at the leadership level of the CDU to get 
the best starting position for the period after the election 
when Helmut Kohl's fate will be decided. 
  Heiner Geissler has conceded that his successor has a good 
heart. That, as he knows, will not be enough for Hintze to 
survive the power struggle because the party traditionally shows 
little consideration for good hearts. For this reason he much 
prefers the analogy with the reed: Its toughness, he warns, 
should not be underestimated--and especially not the sharpness 
of its edges.

<F P=106> [Article by Harald Schumacher: "Good Prospects; Manfred </F>
Brunner, Founder of the Anti-Maastricht Federation of Free 
Citizens"] 
  [Text] The lady behind the steering wheel of the dark blue 
BMW waves a friendly greeting to the man in the pedestrian 
crossing. He waves back and his plump face beams. An 
acquaintance? "No," replies Manfred Brunner, "it often happens 
that people greet me now." Balm for a wounded politician's soul: 
The trained lawyer headed up the Bavarian branch of the Free 
Democratic Party (FDP) when it fell far below the 5-percent 
hurdle in the Landtag elections of 1986. (Brunner: "That was not 
so great.") He gave up the land chairmanship and his membership 
on the national executive board of the liberals in late 1988. 
His new career--he accompanied EC Commissioner Martin Bangemann 
as his chief of cabinet to Brussels in 1989--ended dramatically 
in September 1992: Maastricht architect Helmut Kohl could not 
tame the unruly Maastricht critic and therefore saw to it that 
he was fired. 
  Brunner accounts for the fiasco that became his political 
rebirth with the words "I did not bow to pressure by the Federal 
Chancellor to keep my mouth shut." At first, he sued 
unsuccessfully in the Federal Constitutional Court against the 
Maastricht Treaty. Then, in late January, he founded the 
political party, Federation of Free Citizens. The 46-year-old 
says that he has never received as many letters as he has in the 
last year and a half. Their thrust: "Brunner, stay the course." 
He can hardly conceal his satisfaction when he says that--the 
cleft in his chin quivers and his brown eyes beam behind his 
green-framed glasses. Being in the public eye, according to 
Brunner, "sure is fun." 
  He was even allowed to give a speech this year on the 
periphery of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the world summit 
of the managers' guild. He explained to the managers and 
entrepreneurs why a single European currency will become a 
three-fold disaster: "The weak currency countries will collapse 
because they will not be able to devaluate any more; the strong 
currency countries will hurt themselves because they will lose 
their advantage of stability. Furthermore, we will seal off West 
Europe from Central and East Europe in this way." A listener 
asked how that then could be prevented. Brunner recommended "not 
voting for the single big Social Democratic Party of Germany 
(SPD)/Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/Christian Social Union 
(CSU)/FDP Maastricht Party," but for "people who are willing to 
revise this treaty in 1996"--that is, for him. 
  The fact that Brunner is an advocate of the internal market 
is nearly lost when he analyzes at length the weaknesses of the 
system: Resist "overregulation," the "principle of total 
harmonization," "European homogenized mush," and "Fortress 
Europe." It is scandalous that "Germany is single-handedly 
financing the four major recipient countries." Horst Nasko, vice 
chairman of the board of Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems AG, 
objected in Davos that the internal market without political 
union is not feasible. Yet Brunner regards the road to a 
European federal state to be a fundamentally incorrect one: "A 
democracy--that is, rule by the people-- requires the people, 
and there is no such thing as a European people." 
  The man, it becomes apparent, is certain of his cause. He 
gives all his speeches extemporaneously. Congenially corpulent, 
he gives the impression of total self-assurance and inner peace. 
His secretary--with him now for 12 years--has "never heard him 
yell even once." A man of rare unaffectedness: While drinking 
sweet Italian wine, he uninterruptedly consumes one radish after 
the other and nonchalantly gobbles up all the carrots. If the 
pasta absolutely will not stay on the fork, he gives it some 
help--presto--with his thumb. 
  Hobbies? No, he cannot come up with any. He once played the 
flute and he occasionally goes skiing. He is married and has 
three children ranging in age from 13 to 17. In the mornings he 
drives them to high school, drives back home again, and then 
takes the subway into the city where he shares a law office with 
a colleague. Half of his 12-hour working day is taken up by 
party work: giving interviews, looking for a residence in Berlin 
and a managing director, establishing land and kreis-level party 
branches. The other half is devoted to the legal profession with 
emphasis on European law: The Eurocritic ("Agricultural policy 
is the last island of existing socialism") earns his money by 
guiding companies to the subsidy flesh pots of Brussels. 
  Citizen Brunner is a source of concern to the established 
parties. He would like to garner 30 percent of the vote in the 
European election. He considers this target to be realistic 
because "85 percent of the Germans are opposed to the ECU. 
But, in the election for the Bundestag on 16 October and 
presumably in the Landtag elections in the latter half of the 
year as well, he wants to win the votes of those for whom the 
whole Republic seems like a "fashionable leftist taboo society" 
(Brunner). 
  The creature of acute public irritation with politics, 
Citizens Federation chief Brunner pleas for "more elements of 
plebiscitary democracy." All established parties are "ready for 
the museum" and incumbents should not be permitted to accumulate 
public offices at will. Yet the Federation of Free Citizens that 
has just turned four weeks old is producing posts like a rabbit 
does offspring: Of the approximately 100 members, 23 of them 
alone are members of the national board and an additional five 
are deputy chairmen. High-powered lawyers such as Nuremberg 
Prof. Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider and regulatory liberal 
economists such as Tuebingen Prof. Joachim Starbatty, who is to 
formulate the Citizens Federation's economic and social policy, 
are included in the list of functionaries. The ideal, according 
to Brunner, is "Mrs. Thatcher and her consistent free market 
economic principles." 
  In order to lure away voters from the right wing of the CDU 
and the liberals, the FDP dissident also cooperates with other 
parties. Thus, he is cultivating close relations with Viennese 
Freedom Party of Austria (FPOe) chief Joerg Haider, whose 
positions on policies relating to foreigners he would, to be 
sure, "not formulate in that manner." But Haider can go ahead 
and state them--as an election campaigner for Brunner. Brunner 
feels an affinity--politically and privately--with CSU 
right-winger and Bavarian Minister of the Environment Peter 
Gauweiler. He is also a friend of fired Dasa [Deutsche Aerospace 
AG] board chairman Karl Dersch who used to hoist the old 
imperial war flag in his front garden. 
  Thus, though Brunner could not be accused of right-wing 
extremism, everyone knows what is meant when he declares that 
"truisms must once again be permitted to be uttered." Of course, 
it was he who gave the formal address in early February to the 
Association of Silesian Aristocracy and the Association of 
Catholic Nobility who have certain difficulties in coming to 
terms with the German-Polish border. Obviously he regards Bonn's 
asylum law to be too generous--even in its trimmed-down form. 
And "social policy that only benefits claims specialists," who 
wants that? So nonchalantly does he take the label "Rep 
[Republikaner] light" in stride that opponents pin on him that 
it seems as if it were useful to him. To be sure, he would 
regard "middle class heavy" to be more appropriate. 
  And it is leading liberals who have problems with the former 
fellow traveler who did not leave their party until October 
1993. "Reactionary" and "a wolf in sheep's clothing" remain 
their nicest appellations. Presidential candidate Hildegard 
Hamm-Bruecher, for whom he long worked, knew him to be 
"politically gifted and a very good speaker" but extreme in his 
opinions: "The FDP certainly shifted, but never as far to the 
right as Mr. Brunner." 
  It would please the native-born Munich resident to show all 
of them who now revile him and who are already writing him off 
as a loser--in the European election, of course, but also in 
Bavaria where elections for the Landtag will be held on 25 
September. Brunner stands at his office window and looks 
pensively across splendid Maximilian Street to the parliament he 
was never a member of due to a lack of votes and asks--meaning 
the panorama or his political prospects or both: "Is that not a 
fine prospect?"

"Regulatory Policy Hard-Liners; Brunner's Economists"] 
  [Text] As far back as two years ago, Christian Democratic 
Union (CDU) member Joachim Starbatty was already dissatisfied 
with his party. The Tuebing professor of political economy 
thought then that the CDU had made serious economic mistakes at 
the time of German unification and many of its visionary 
thinkers had "steered expectations in the wrong direction." The 
chancellor's party, according to Starbatty, had "gone into 
neutral in the area of regulatory policy." 
  Many of his colleagues saw it the same way as well. But 
Starbatty, who has been upholding liberal principles as chairman 
of the Action League for a Social Free Market Economy since 
1991, is now acting accordingly. Since January, the professor, 
to whom friends ascribe a "crusading temperament," has been 
deputy chairman of the Federation of Free Citizens, on whose 
executive committee two other economists of the neoliberal 
school also serve: Franz-Ulrich Willeke, a retired economics 
professor from Heidelberg, and Bernd Thomas Ramb, an active 
businessman with a second job as an nontenured professor in 
Siegen. Roland Vaubel, professor of political economy in 
Mannheim, collaborated on the new party's platform and wants "to 
continue to advise" Brunner's forces "on social and economic 
policy issues." He is not even disturbed by the party founder's 
closeness to right-wing extremist politicians such as Joerg 
Haider, head of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPOe). Vaubel: 
"That is only an image that some people want to foist on him." 
  While other protest parties come to the fore as programmatic 
no-names, Brunner's economists are attempting to revive a 
brandname item: "Social free-market economics along the lines of 
Ludwig Erhard" is the recipe of Starbatty, who himself was 
trained in the academic school of Alfred Mueller-Armack, a 
fellow traveler of Erhard. The economist is calling for an 
all-round renewal through market forces and competition. The 
welfare state is allegedly "facing an imminent collapse" and a 
"rigid wage system" is supposedly "robbing the unemployed of 
opportunity." Individual responsibility must once again "be 
granted and be expected." The highly touted social peace, 
Starbatty believes, has long been far too costly in this country 
and overvalued as an advantage for the location of industry: "It 
exists in Great Britain today as well." 
  The regulatory policy fundamentalists see themselves 
agreeing 
with prominent colleagues in the matter of their hit election 
campaign issue: `no' to a European Monetary Union. In a 
sensational manifesto back in 1992, 60 economics professors 
declared their opposition to bidding farewell to the German 
mark. Integration by agreements from above "will paralyze 
competition and centralize risks," warns monetary expert 
Franz-Ulrich Willeke, who is particularly rankled by the fact 
that "justified reservations" are constantly being dismissed as 
"heavy-handed fear-mongering." It is finally time now to shuffle 
up the old parties' cartel. Professor Willeke is delighted: "We 
are, after all, a social experiment."

"Turnaround Led to Militancy--`Spillover From East' Thesis Is 
Scarcely Accepted"] 
  [Text] Kay Nehm, the federal chief prosecutor, said last 
week that right-wing radicalism spilled over from east to west 
after unification. Well-known political scientists and 
sociologists do not agree. 
  The scientists, responding to queries from BERLINER ZEITUNG 
do agree that militancy, proneness to violence and aggression 
are more pronounced in the new laender than in the old but that 
right-wing extremism is not. 
  Manfred Funke, a Bonn political scientist, points out that 
right-wing extremism has always been more flagrant in the west 
than in the east. There has been a strong right-wing element in 
the old laender from the very start, he says, citing the ban on 
the right-wing radical SRP [Socialist Reich Party] in 1952 and 
the emergence of the NPD [National Democratic Party] in the 
sixties. Funke also points out that a clear-cut right-wing 
ideology complete with leadership personalities never did exist 
in the east. The right-wing radical riots in the east following 
unification were more of a way of saying no to reality; a 
protest outlet for explosive mass desperation about the social 
situation. 
  Funke believes that the real problem is not right-wing or 
left-wing extremism but the "loss of the democratic center" as a 
counterforce. 
  Eckhard Jesse, a Chemnitz political scientist, also thinks 
Nehm's statement is something of an exaggeration. Although it is 
true that aggression is more pronounced in the east than in the 
west and that right-wing extremism has gotten a new lease on 
life as a result of events in eastern Germany, the question is 
whether it really makes sense to speak of right-wing extremism 
in eastern Germany in the aftermath of unification. Antifascism, 
after all, had such a strong impact [in eastern Germany] that 
right-wing extremism never really existed. Right-wing radicalism 
as it manifested itself in the east after unification was a kind 
of "costume fascism," says Jesse. Underneath, all the social 
problems lie hidden. 
  Marburg political scientist Armin Pfahl-Traughbert says that 
the spillover thesis is only partially correct, i.e. insofar as 
it applies to militancy which is more manifest in eastern 
Germany than in the western part of the country. It is not 
right-wing extremism but the extremist potential generally which 
is greater in eastern Germany, he believes. 
  In the opinion of two Bielefeld sociologists there is no 
scientific proof for Nehm's statement. Youth researcher Klaus 
Hurrelmann says that the east-to-west spillover thesis is simply 
"bizarre and historically incorrect. If anything did spill 
over," Hurrelmann says, "then it was west to east." He thinks 
the reason for the sharp rise in the proneness to violence in 
eastern Germany is the "sudden radical change into a capitalist 
society." Many people were unable to cope with insecurity and 
the lack of familiarity with foreign cultures. 
  Hurrelmann believes the threshold has now been reached at 
which the spontaneous protest movement has turned more and more 
distinctly into a political movement with leaders which 
organizes and solidifies itself. "That is the real danger," he 
says. 
  Wilhelm Heitmeyer, a colleague of Hurrelmann's, 
characterizes 
the Nehm thesis as an "institutional way of looking at things 
which is inaccurate in this form." Heitmeyer, the head of the 
youth research center at Bielefeld University, believes that the 
logistic base of right-wing extremism is situated in western 
Germany while the greater potential for violence is situated in 
the eastern part of the country. His studies have shown that 
neo-Nazis with a proneness to violence are more numerous in the 
new laender whereas the corresponding political parties such as 
the Republikaner are less popular. 
<H5>  2,000 Activists at the Time of Unification </H5>
  For a long time the GDR denied that there was such a thing 
as 
right-wing extremism among young people. Even an attack by 30 
skinheads on the Zion Church in East Berlin in October 1987 was 
downplayed as an example of "rowdyism." 
  And yet, the fact of the matter is that internal Stasi 
documents set the date of the start of the right-wing extremist 
movement as 1982. In the late eighties, the Stasi estimated that 
there were some 800 neo-Nazis in 38 different groups, including 
"Zyklon B" in Berlin and "SS Division Walter Krueger" in Rostock. 
  According to a study by the then-Joint Land Criminal Police 
Office (GLKA), just under 2,000 persons belonged to the hard 
core of right-wing extremist groups in eastern Germany at the 
time of unification, with another 15,000 persons characterized 
as sympathizers. "The road to right-wing extremism frequently 
leads to social and political contradictions via a decidedly 
emotional way of looking at things," said Bernd Wagner, the head 
the extremism/terrorism department of GLKA in 1991.

<F P=106> [Gerd Brueggemann report: "In Search of Recipes Against </F>
Unemployment"] 
  [Text] The national economies of the Western 
industrialized nations have been faced with a problem since the 
beginning of the 1990s that they believed had been overcome a 
long time ago: Persistent high unemployment. At 11 percent, it 
has reached an alarming level in the European Union. There are 
hardly any signs that this tendency will reverse once the 
current recession is overcome. 
  In the United States, where the economy has been growing 
again in the past two years, a number of new jobs have been 
created but expectations have not been fulfilled as far as the 
quantity and, above all, quality is concerned. Developments in 
the labor market will in the future no longer primarily be 
determined by the economic ups and downs but by structural 
factors that are difficult to eliminate. 
  This is one of the reasons that the United States organized 
a 
conference of the seven major industrialized nations -- the 
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and 
Canada -- in Detroit on Monday [14 March] and Tuesday, which was 
exclusively devoted to this topic. The responsible finance, 
economics, and labor ministers discussed the causes of the 
problem in four working groups, seeking a solution to the 
problem. Quick successes were not to be expected. Yet German 
Ministers Waigel, Rexrodt, and Bluem got the impression after 
exchanging views with their counterparts over a day and a half 
that the trip to Detroit was useful. 
  One of the concerns the Germans wanted to discuss in the 
automobile capital was removed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
his opening speech: "Let us start by acknowledging the 
fundamental reality that private enterprise, not government 
action, is the engine of growth in the economic sector and in 
the creation of new jobs." Thus, he made it clear from the 
beginning that the conference was not designed -- or at least 
only to a very limited extent -- to persuade the visitors to 
adopt programs to boost the economy, which in the past only led 
to straw fires before elections. 
  Clinton believes that the tasks the state must fulfill offer 
the enterprises the required preconditions for growth and 
preparing the population for a working life in the new 
environment of the global competitive economy. How the tasks 
are to be defined and how they can be fulfilled was one of the 
most important subjects of discussion in Detroit. 
  Difficulties arose quickly in this respect because the 
economic and social realities in the United States and Europe 
are completely different. In the United States, over 35 million 
new jobs were created in the past 20 years -- many of which 
required high qualification and were well paid, but many of 
which offered employment for workers with low qualifications at 
low wages. Generally, real incomes in the United States have not 
risen during this period. The difference between high-income 
earners and have-nots has increased dramatically and does not 
only threaten "the economic strength of the United States but 
also the social structures of our democratic society." (Clinton) 
  In Europe, the enterprises postponed restructuring measures 
for a long time. This had the effect that the real incomes of 
those who had jobs continued to increase considerably, but that 
overall employment declined. Social peace was preserved because 
the unemployed and short-time workers received relatively high 
social benefits. 
  In view of these different developments, are we only faced 
with a choice "between poverty in the United States and 
unemployment in Europe," as economic scientist Barry Bosworth 
from the Brookings Institution in Washington asked ironically? 
U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich considers this a wrong 
alternative: "We must combine the education and training 
systems that exist in Europe and Japan with the dynamic mobility 
and flexibility that exists in the United States," he suggested. 
Yet there is the danger that not the good but the bad aspects 
are exchanged.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carl Gustaf Stroehm: "From Berlin Things Look </F>
Different: The Neighbors in the East Have Moved Closer 
Again--The German Challenge Is Central Europe"] 
  [Excerpts] With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 
collapse of the communist regimes, not only the "system of 
Yalta" has burst asunder. Unnoticed by many, the order of 
Versailles has also perished. Almost simultaneously with the 
reunification of Germany and the independence of the Central and 
East European nations, those two "supranational" states, which 
one can call products of the 1919 world of Versailles, fell 
apart: First multinational Yugoslavia, and a short time later 
multinational Czechoslovakia. 
  With the reduction of Soviet (Russian) military might and 
ultimately the splintering of the Soviet empire, a concept, 
disapproved of and even tabooed for a long time, gained 
prominence in the political debate: "Central Europe." In 1915, 
in the midst of World War I, the great Liberal, Friedrich 
Naumann, had presented "Central Europe," so to speak, as the war 
goal of the Kaiser empire--whereby he called the idea of the 
nation and the national state a democratic and liberal 
achievement. He recommended that the Germans, becoming a nation 
themselves, also advance the Slavic peoples and become the 
advocate for the medium-sized and smaller nations of that region 
which extends from the Russian western border to the German 
eastern border. 
  Certainly, the preconditions have changed under which 
Naumann 
had developed his conception of Central Europe. But today's 
generation, after a long and bitter hiatus, has again become 
aware of the idea that the states and peoples of Central Europe 
have common interests, a common history, and common future 
opportunities. 
  This "center" of Europe extends east from Germany and 
Austria 
to Ukraine; north to the Baltic Sea region; southeast as far as 
Hungary, Slovenia, and Croatia. In a certain sense, Bulgaria 
also professes itself a part of this European center, although 
it is a Balkan state. Romania, at least in its Transylvanian 
region which until 1918 had been a part of the Danube monarchy 
[Austria], tends in the same direction, although the French 
influence is strong there. [passage omitted] 
  The San Andreas fault in California is often called a 
rupture 
line where there is increased danger of earthquakes. In the east 
of Central Europe, there exists a historical-political San 
Andreas fault line: a zone where different mentalities, 
religions, and views of the state clash. In many cases, this is 
not so much due to ethnic differences. The divergent outlook on 
life has a much deeper effect. It leads to the situation where 
Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, or Muslim Bosnians, are 
alien to each other, although they have been living together in 
the same village for decades and speak almost the same language. 
[passage omitted] 
  Until now, none of these nations had even been asked whether 
they wanted to be a part of the Warsaw Pact or the communist 
camp. It is a bitter irony of fate that, in certain regards, 
they have no say today, either. The wish of the postcommunist 
countries to be admitted into NATO with equal rights remained 
unfulfilled. Instead, they were fobbed off with a cheap 
substitute solution (which does not obligate the West to 
anything), the Partnership for Peace. 
  When Western politicans assert that it will take a certain 
time until these states are "ripe" enough to be truly admitted 
to Western communities, the question arises: Does that time even 
exist? Does Central Europe not run the danger of once again 
being run over by developments? 
  The world historic stroke of luck for the Central European 
nations consisted of the fact that, after the fall of the Wall, 
the Soviet Union as an imperial power also disappeared from the 
scene. For the first time in history, the center of the 
continent was able to start organizing freely--without direct 
power-political intervention by external powers. Even in 1990/91 
it was foreseeable that Russia, as an insulted, humbled 
superpower robbed of its trophies, in the long term would not be 
put off with the role of onlooker and recipient of alms. The 
West, however, plagued by irrational fearful visions of a 
"disintegration" of the USSR (a disintegration that could not be 
averted, anyway), had only one prescription at hand: support for 
the Moscow central power against the "centrifugal" tendencies. 
Even today, the idea still lurks in Western minds that the newly 
created "ministates" from the Baltic to Slovakia are not really 
viable, and hence "anachronistic." 
  In reality, the creation, recreation or independence of 
these 
states is of great importance, especially for the western part 
of Europe. If the Russian area between St. Petersburg and 
Vladivostok takes decades to consolidate, then the area west of 
the Russian state border acquires a special, specific weight for 
the continent's security. 
  Up to now one could form the impression that Western policy 
was putting the cart before the horse: The FRG has expended 
enormous amounts in aid to Russia which have disappeared in a 
"black hole" without significantly consolidating the situation 
or, for example, preventing the election success of the 
Zhirinovsky party. Ukraine, on the other hand, came off almost 
empty-handed. 
  Would it not have made more sense to first consolidate the 
Central European area economically, and from there to approach 
the "Russian question?" Instead, one concentrated on Russia and 
in fact neglected the medium-sized and smaller states. 
  Regarding Germany, the question remains whether the problem 
of "Central Europe" has even penetrated the consciousness of the 
political class in Bonn. This lack is all the more astounding 
since reunification resulted in a shift of the geographic (and 
spiritual) coordinates. Although the Federal Republic of Germany 
still carries the name it received during partition--it is no 
longer identical with the state once ruled by Adenauer. The 
focus is shifting from the Rhine to the Spree River, from a West 
European setting to the center. 
  Thereby united Germany is again transformed into a "Central 
European" power. In the longer term this means: The political 
perspective is also changing. From Berlin the world looks 
different from the vantage point of Bonn in the Rhine valley. 
The neighbors in the East have suddenly moved closer, those in 
the West (although this should not be seen as dramatic) are a 
little farther away than before. The Germans have remained a 
people of the European center--and if there is a "task" for them 
at all, it lies in this center. 
  After World War I, and especially after World War II, this 
central location was overlaid by other constellations--after 
1945, by the partition of Germany. The fact that removal of the 
partition at the same time also brought freedom for the nations 
which until then had been "forgotten" behind the Iron Curtain, 
only underlines the fact that Central Europe has a common fate. 
  Germans today are affected by events in the entire 
postcommunist area more closely and, in part, more painfully 
than any other (West) European peoples. The days when other 
powers or authorities relieved us Germans of great decisions 
(and risks) are over. But decisions approach us in inexorably 
concrete form, such as the question whether Bonn sees the 
priority of its foreign policy in the East with Russia, or with 
the medium-sized and smaller states. The answer to that decides 
everything. Preferential German-Russian relations can only be at 
the expense of the interest of the smaller states. Vice versa, 
if Germany becomes the champion of the Central European states 
and their independence and security, then political conflicts 
and opposing interests with the "great power, Russia" surely are 
inevitable. 
  Should Germany not take up its Central European task and 
opportunity, the consequences could be very negative--for the 
Central European states as well as the Germans themselves. A new 
power-political thrust by Moscow, be it against Ukraine or the 
Baltic states, would place Germany in a difficult situation and 
would deteriorate the political climate radically. 
  One can only hope that this time what so often had not been 
achieved will succeed: the creation of a consolidated Central 
European area that offers a bridge toward Russia--but at the 
same time, protection against imponderables coming from Russia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Bernt Conrad: "Bonn Is Becoming the Mecca for </F>
Aid-Seekers from the East: When It Comes To Putting Democratic 
Reforms Into Practice the Germans Are on Hand Everywhere"] 
  [Text] In Bonn, political visitors from the reform states 
of Central and East Europe and the successor states of the 
Soviet Union are passing each other at the door. Last week, the 
foreign ministers of Ukraine and Azerbeijan were here; this 
week, the Hungarian prime minister, the Belarus foreign 
minister, and the foreign policy commission of the Czech 
parliament appeared; and next week, the foreign ministers of 
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are expected. 
  Why does Germany attract them all like a magnet? Because for 
our Eastern neighbors, we are the bridge to Europe, and 
simultaneously a model for the ascent from politican and 
economic destruction. Just as the Germans after the collapse of 
1945 built a flourishing community from ruins and have preserved 
to this day a much-envied measure of stability and prosperity, 
the people in the East want to do the same--and use German 
advice and German support for it. This wish was strengthened by 
the fact that the FRG itself is integrating into its political 
and economic system a formerly communist constituent state; that 
furthermore, it is not a great power in the classical sense and 
hence more attractive to many in the East than the old Western 
powers. 
  Actually, the trust resulting from this--beyond the known 
financial assistance--has already led to a dense network of 
connections. Important in it are the vocational and professional 
trainers who are sent from Germany to the neighboring Eastern 
states to provide practical assistance and establish the dual 
educational system considered worthy of emulation. A second arm 
of the Trust Agency, the Trust Agency East, does privatization 
consulting in the East. The Reconstruction Loan Corporation is 
represented in all Central and East European states and in all 
CIS countries. 
  Especially effective is a private senior experts service 
headquartered in Bonn, which aids the governments of the reform 
countries in getting qualified expert consultants: Retirees help 
in building up democratic structures, even in establishing a 
foreign service. For example, a chief of government asked for a 
consultant to explain to him from case to case to which 
institutions and persons in West Europe he can turn. Quite 
officially, young diplomats of the Central and East European 
countries and the CIS states are being trained in Germany. In 
two training courses with 25 participants annually, the Bonn 
Foreign Office sees to the adjustment to Western ways of 
thinking and behavior. 
  An expert summarized: "We are on hand everywhere in 
practical 
reform work." Against this background, prominent politicians 
also flock to Bonn to ensure cooperation on concrete questions. 
Thus the chief of the Belarus foreign office, Petr Kravchanka, 
sought assistance from colleague Kinkel for the victims of 
Chernobyl and financial aid for the destruction of 2,000 former 
Soviet tanks, withdrawn from eastern Germany and left behind in 
Belarus. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Anatoly Slenko, was 
primarily concerned with cooperation in economic reforms. 
  Hungary's head of government, Peter Boross, beyond details, 
wanted to nail down--like all his colleagues in Central, East, 
and southeast Europe--a more general support by the federal 
chancellor for the road to membership in the European Union [EU] 
and NATO. And one does not need much imagination to predict that 
next Wednesday [9 March], the three Baltic foreign ministers 
will emphatically demand German solidarity for their peoples, 
menaced by new greater-Russian emotions. 
  The new responsibility stemming from this is immense for the 
Federal Government. It is furthermore complicated by the fact 
that certain aspects of cooperation are contradictory within 
themselves: 
  How is one to lead the East and Central Europeans to the EU 
and NATO and at the same time satisfy the Russian president, 
esteemed as a partner, with his totally different views? And how 
does the desired strengthening of the Baltic states fit into 
this? These are questions confronting Kohl and Kinkel. Good will 
alone is not enough to answer them conclusively.

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "Paris Should Only Commit Its </F>
Blue Helmets to `Clear and Achievable' UN Mandates"] 
  [Text] Francois Trucy, (UDF-RPR [French Democratic 
Union-Rally for the Republic]) senator for Var and mayor of 
Toulon, published a report on Tuesday, 15 March, which Edouard 
Balladur had commissioned from him on France's participation in 
UN peacekeeping operations. The senator advocates in particular 
that France should henceforth only become involved in "clear and 
achievable" mandates and that it should demand openness within 
the organization, for instance, costs should be disclosed as 
soon as the political decision is made. 
  In seven years, the number of soldiers, policemen, and 
civilian administrators required in the field for UN 
peacekeeping operations has gone from 10,935 men in 1987 to 
85,000 in 1993. This is a real explosion of demand: No less 
than 13 ongoing actions, in eight of which French blue helmets 
are involved. The United Nations did not prepare for that, or 
it did so in a totally inappropriate way. Is evidence needed? 
The department which heads these peacekeeping operations from 
New York now has a team of 80 officials. "There is a great deal 
of work and very few people," Francois Trucy writes, reporting 
the ironic remark of a French officer who said that "the United 
Nations works at a glacial speed." 
  "Everything starts with and goes back to the secretary 
general," Mr. Trucy remarked. However, "there is no provision 
for any succession of command" if the secretary general were to 
disappear. The military structures at his side are not 
comparable with a general staff "capable of preparing, planning, 
and conducting large operations." There is no real operations 
room "following up" operations, as there is in modern armies or, 
if there is one, the French senator was not allowed to see it. 
"An aura of mystery still surrounds it," he writes. Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has only one military adviser. 
  Member states, which are asked to provide "standby" 
battalions, in other words forces which can potentially be 
included in a framework set at around 100,000 men, take a lot of 
persuading because they do not want to "tie up in advance" units 
which they might need for national missions. The only military 
body "which appears as such in the UN Charter" is the general 
staff committee --formed by the chiefs of staff of the permanent 
members of the Security Council -- whose meetings "are a formal 
ritual without substance" and whose agenda, once it does meet, 
"is to ensure that it will meet again. And that is all." 
  "If we (the French) think that peacekeeping operations will 
be one of the essential tasks of our armed forces in the next 10 
years," Mr. Trucy notes, "it is essential that our best 
elements, our best officers, our best diplomats should apply for 
and obtain positions of responsibility within the United Nations 
in proportion to our involvement." The senator thinks that "we 
are still all too often just the water which turns the mill," 
with around 9,000 to 10,000 French blue helmets. It is 
therefore appropriate to derive as much as possible from "the 
military investment" by an increased presence "in the political, 
diplomatic, economic," and administrative spheres. Otherwise, 
France will risk itself for other countries. "It is important," 
Mr. Trucy thinks, "that so-called peacekeeping operations should 
not be reduced to American operations legitimized by the United 
Nations or UN operations authorized by the United States." 
<H5>  Indulging in `Waste' </H5>
  The crisis of confidence which some states are experiencing 
with regard tothe United Nations is accompanied by a serious 
financial crisis in that organization. Out of a total budget of 
$6.2 billion in 1993, which includes annual administrative costs 
(50,000 salaries to pay, instead of 1,000 in 1946) and the 
financial requirements of peacekeeping operations, the United 
Nations is short some $1.5 billion from member state fees, and 
the United Nations itself has a repayment arrears of over $600 
million toward states which have advanced it men and equipment. 
  For peacekeeping operations alone in 1993, France's share 
was 
1.6 billion francs [Fr], to which must be added a sum of Fr5.5 
billion -- for the maintenance of its blue helmets -- paid for 
by the Defense Ministry and partly or belatedly repaid by the 
United Nations. "At the end of 1993," the senator writes, 
"France had a Fr600-million claim on the United Nations." 
  Mr. Trucy talks of "unnecessary or excessive spending, 
uncontrolled costs," and "badly monitored spending," or 
"artificially inflated budgets," like the order for 850 
minibuses for Cambodia "following a misunderstanding." 
  In certain circumstances, the United Nations forces a 
country 
to indulge in "waste." "For instance," the senator points out, 
"at the end of its mission in Cambodia, the French contingent 
destroyed its stock of munitions because repatriation would have 
been too dangerous. Let us mention the case of the S-30 
air-to-air missiles which, although not fired in the framework 
of operation Deny Flight, have to be replaced after a few dozen 
flying hours. This weapon, designed in the seventies, is 
intended for air combat missions, and it is now being used in 
the framework of overflight interdiction missions. The Air 
Force has designed several solutions to counter these 
inadequacies. The fact remains that these missiles have a unit 
cost of several million francs and it is difficult not to make a 
connection between this unforeseen use and the order for 110 new 
missiles placed in 1994." 
  Mr. Trucy makes 100 proposals to the prime minister intended 
"to increase the quality, stringency, and efficacy of our 
relations with the United Nations." Around 15 of them are 
worthy of note. They are all aimed at securing "clear and 
achievable mandates" which require from the secretary general "a 
prior geopolitical analysis, a more accurate estimate of the 
cost, real military expertise, a timetable making provision in 
particular for reevaluations of the mission, involvement of the 
main contributors, and the agreement of the parties involved." 
Mr. Trucy asks for a more rapid "creation of a planning group 
tasked with preparing future peacekeeping operations," the 
creation of a "budget control and austerity body," and for the 
French parliament to be informed about any involvement of French 
forces outside national borders, as is the case in the United 
States.

  [Excerpts] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- Caen Mayor Jean-Marie 
Girault on Wednesday [16 March] backed down on a plan to invite 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend a ceremony there to mark 
the 50th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy on June 6. 
  Girault, who visited the German embassy here, did not hand 
over an invitation to Kohl, but one for ambassador Juergen 
Sudhoff after the two held a meeting, an embassy spokesman said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Speaking on RTL radio later, Girault said he could not 
officially invite Kohl, but still wanted the chancellor to 
attend. He said Sudhoff had accepted the invitation, on 
condition the Bonn government approved it. [passage omitted] 
  An opinion poll in the French Christian weekly LA VIE said 
57 
percent of the French favoured a German Government presence at 
the D-Day ceremonies.

  [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- The head of France's 
far-right National Front party, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on Wednesday 
[16 March] criticized the trial of wartime Nazi collaborator 
Paul Touvier as "unnecessary" and his alleged crime "a detail of 
the past." 
  Touvier, whose trial starts Thursday in Versailles, west of 
Paris, will be the first French national to be tried for crimes 
against humanity. He is accused of ordering the reprisal 
execution of seven Jewish hostages on June 29, 1944 when he was 
intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia in the eastern 
city of Lyon. 
  "It strikes me as sad that 50 years after the war we still 
cannot pardon our former German adversary and that we are trying 
to find in an 80-year-old man the responsibility that might 
really belong to the Vichy regime, but especially also to the 
governments that prepared the build-up to the war and that lost 
the war," he said on French radio. (Touvier is 79). 
  "France has enough other problems than to dig up details of 
its past," Le Pen said. 
  Le Pen, known for his anti-Semitism, once described Hitler's 
"final solution" -- the mass extermination of Jews -- as "a 
point of detail of history." 
  The Touvier case will throw the spotlight on wartime French 
collaboration with the Germans -- still a sensitive subject in 
France -- and also raise questions about the role of Roman 
Catholic clergy who sheltered and funded Touvier for some 45 
years.

  [Text] Toulon, France, March 17 (AFP) -- Police made eight 
new arrests, mainly among suspected members of the local 
underworld, in the Toulon area early Thursday [17 March] in 
connection with the mafia-style murder of anti-corruption MP 
Yann Piat. 
  They said it was the third such swoop since Piat was 
murdered 
in a contract killing on February 25 that exposed links between 
political corruption and France's Mediterranean mafia out for 
kickbacks. 
  Piat's two presumed killers, Epifanio Pericolo, 28, and 
Denis 
Labadie, 27, were arrested and charged two weeks ago, but police 
are trying to find out who ordered the murder. 
  Several prominent local politicians have been questioned in 
connection of the slaying of Piat, a member of the center-right 
UDF-RPR [French Democratic Union-Rally for the Republic] 
parliamentary group, who was also campaigning against drug 
trafficking. 
  In a posthumous letter, Piat, 44, denounced what she had 
called "collusion between elected officials and the local 
underworld" in a variety of financial deals. 
  Piat's killing was the first of a French parliamentarian 
since December 1976 when Prince Jean de Broglie was murdered. 
That case remains unsolved.

  [Text] The first of six frigates built by France for Taiwan 
was launched, in utmost secrecy, during the night of 11-12 March 
at Lorient. The launch of the frigate, baptized Mop-1, took 
place at 0300 and was attended only by a Taiwan delegation. 
According to the port authorities, this launch was done at night 
for "technical reasons." 
  In reality, however, the French Government always has been 
reticent about this 14-billion-franc [Fr] naval contract known 
under the codename "Bravo," and it only very reluctantly 
admitted to the existence of a second contract with Taipei for 
60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft (Fr30 billion). 
  The Mop-1 frigate then was moved to a Lorient-Keroman port 
dock for further arming. 
  The Taiwan vessels will be equipped with French equipment 
and 
arms systems, contrary to what government circles had said at 
the time when the French press disclosed the contract. The 
second vessel, Mop-2, is scheduled to be launched in September.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacques Baumel, vice president of the National </F>
Assembly Defense Commission: "White Paper: Do We Have the Means 
To Carry Out Our Ambitions?"] 
  [Text] To define our country's defense policy for the next 
20 years is a difficult exercise in a period of crisis. This is 
particularly the case today, when unforeseen uncertainties and 
threats compel us to envisage an entire series of situations 
quite different from those of yesterday's cold war. 
  How is it possible to set new missions for our armies 
without 
the certainty of guaranteeing them the necessary capabilities 
and means in the present state of our finances? Nothing is less 
certain! Of course, in 1993 the government temporarily stopped 
the decline in our defense expenditures. Does this mean we can 
be sure that in the next five years the military planning law 
that will come up for a vote in three months will allow the 
continuation of large-scale programs already significantly 
delayed and the simultaneous manufacture of new types of weapons 
necessary for our defense by the year 2010 or 2015, such as 
satellites, laser systems and antimissile defenses? Nothing is 
less certain, since there is already a shortage of more than 40 
billion francs simply to carry out present plans properly, 
without even mentioning the difficulty of taking care of the 
military planning law, which will amount to at least 600 billion 
in the next five years. 
  Without contesting the credibility of the analyses and 
evaluations of the white paper, we cannot fail to note the 
serious gap that exists in it between the size of its ambitions 
and the precariousness of the financial resources to be 
allocated to our armies. 
  How can one hope to finance the costly means demanded by the 
new "all-crisis" missions envisaged in the white paper when it 
is presently a fact that a bitter discussion centers on whether 
to grant more than 1 percent of the annual growth of the defense 
budget, at a time when a growth of 5 percent ought to be 
contemplated to face all the needs of our armed forces, and when 
below the painful cuts below the 2-percent mark will have to be 
made? 
  Cuts are thus inevitable, even if the more necessary ones 
are rejected in favor of the least painful ones that will ensure 
easier passage of the law. Courage would consist in not 
obstinately continuing to manufacture weapons planned 20 years 
ago for cold war conflicts, which will be obsolete when they go 
into service after many delays. 
  Will new programs such as the NH90 helicopters be sacrificed 
in order not to stop existing orders? On the other hand, why 
preserve--perhaps to cancel it later like the Hades--the 
contested M5 missile program, so dear to President Mitterrand, 
to equip the new nuclear submarines, and, on land, the obsolete 
Albion plateau silos that are increasingly losing their 
usefulness because of their vulnerability? And all this to the 
detriment of a more flexible second nuclear airborne component? 
Can anyone seriously believe that we will remain credible 
without nuclear testing, which does not appear in the white 
paper, or with an air force reduced to less than 300 aircraft 
and ground forces that will have failed to draw lessons from a 
Gulf war won through the superiority of intelligent weapons and 
real time, communications, and battlefield control electronic 
intelligence systems? Is it known that it will be a long time 
before France possesses the four intelligent weapons that 
ensured an overwhelming victory in the Gulf war, without 
mentioning the 3,000 computers used on the battlefield and 
linked to some 30,000 computers in the United States? Such will 
be tomorrow's war. 
  Maintaining conscription within the framework of a mixed 
army will slow down the necessary reform of the military service 
and the increased professionalization of our projection forces, 
which are still in great need of transportation, logistics and 
intelligence means. 
  Showing too much prudence, the authors of the white paper 
fail to sufficiently stress the need for France to double its 
space program so as not to be disqualified in tomorrow's world 
vis-a-vis the superpowers. But how can one be present on these 
new battlefields without strongly reinforcing our defense 
system, an initiative not envisaged in a white paper written by 
an "establishment" [English in the text] more sensitive to 
continuity and prudence than to innovation and updating? 
  How is it possible to plead for a European defense--the need 
for which is illustrated by the Bosnian tragedy--and not propose 
at the same time improved strategic and industrial European 
cooperation? Since it is obvious, in light of these needs, that 
it is not through the usual budget procedures that the 
maintenance of capabilities and the modernization of our defense 
will be ensured, why not contemplate other forms of financing, 
without shrinking from allocating to our armed forces part of 
the significant revenues from privatizations? After all, this 
would be just as useful for the future of our nation than to use 
such revenues to fill the abyss of the Air France, Bull or 
National Railroad Company deficits brought about by their 
leaders' disastrous management. It is better to pay for a good 
life insurance policy than to undertake Sisyphean tasks.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Mario Soares by Sandra </F>
Cohen; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Cohen] The issue of immigration to Portugal was 
aggravated after Portugal joined the European Union (EU). Every 
day five tourists are expelled from Portugal. Isn't it 
contradictory to close the borders when there are 4.5 million 
Portuguese abroad? 
  [Soares] I am against the restrictive immigration policy, 
which falls under the government's jurisdiction, and not under 
my jurisdiction. Portugal has international obligations because 
it is a member of the EU which, as is known, is abolishing 
internal borders. I believe foreigners should be treated with 
due consideration, especially Brazilians, because for years 
Brazil has welcomed the Portuguese, and is still giving 
privileged treatment to the Portuguese who are living in that 
country. 
  [Cohen] Are you and Prime Minister Cavaco Silva afraid of 
the 
social consequences of the possible return to the country of 
500,000 Portuguese immigrants from South Africa? 
  [Soares] I believe this will not happen. Efforts should be 
made for the Portuguese who are in South Africa to cooperate 
with the democratization process. I am willing to ask for the 
Portuguese people's support in the elections, because elections 
are very important. If things do not work properly, we cannot 
abandon the Portuguese who are living there. 
  [Cohen] Twenty years after the Revolution of Nails 
[Revolucao 
dos Cravos], do you think the ideals that prompted the military 
revolt have been betrayed? 
  [Soares] No. The Revolution of Nails attained its 
objectives, which are outlined in the so-called three D's: 
democratization, decolonization, and development. 
  [Cohen] The decolonization process was traumatic, and could 
not be overcome by the main ex-colonies, like Angola and 
Mozambique. What is, in your opinion, the reason for this 
failure? 
  [Soares] I would not say decolonization in Africa has 
failed. 
I blame the traumas on the conditions under which the colonial 
war developed. Portugal was placed under a ferocious 
dictatorship. It impeded the formation of African elites, 
making the nationalists shift to the international communist 
movement. 
  [Cohen] What do you think of the criticism of actress 
Christiane Torloni about the boycott she suffered in Portugal? 
  [Soares] I believe her criticism was a bit inopportune, but 
I 
do not attach too much significance to the case. She is a nice 
artist who enjoys popularity in Portugal, who received a major 
subsidy, and who appeared in funny ads. 
  [Cohen] The euphoria that prevailed in Portugal at the end 
of 
the 1980's, and the myth that the country was an oasis, gave 
rise to an economic crisis. What went wrong? 
  [Soares] The European Community aid was important for the 
development and modernization of some infrastructure areas, but 
some reforms the country needs have not yet been implemented. 
Free market conditions are posing problems for Portuguese 
enterprises. Tourism seems to be improving. We still have to 
receive major aid from the Community. I hope it will be 
properly used so we can reactivate, as we should, the Portuguese 
productive sector. Over the past few years the entire European 
continent has experienced a strong recession, which has also 
affected Portugal. 
  [Cohen] What is the solution to the crisis? 
  [Soares] To strengthen the Portuguese productive sector. 
This also involves the field of education. We should bet on 
the intelligence of the Portuguese people, on their immense 
capacity for adaptation and creativity. 
  [Cohen] Do you agree with Ambassador Jose Aparecido de 
Oliveira's project to create a Community of Portuguese-Speaking 
Countries? 
  [Soares] It is very important for Brazil and for Portugal to 
understand that it could be very profitable for them to create a 
true brotherhood and design common plans for the future. The 
fact that Portugal is a European country and an EU member is not 
in contradiction with its love for Brazil or with our priority 
purpose of designing a coordinated policy with Brazil. 
  [Cohen] What are, in your opinion, the mistakes that led to 
the defeat of the French Socialist Party? 
  [Soares] The French Socialist Party had a very sketchy 
vision 
of the French situation. It tried to implement a 
nationalization policy, but had to back down three years later 
because of poor economic results. There were lamentable 
corruption cases, even though they are neither more nor less 
significant than those occurring in rightist governments. They 
are more serious when they occur within the leftist sector, 
because a lot more is always expected from this sector.

  [Text] This afternoon the Spanish foreign minister 
explained the fishing agreement that was reached last night in 
the European Union. [Javier] Solana says that it was the most 
difficult negotiation in his life. He added that Spain had to 
fight alone to defend its interests, and that with this 
agreement our fishing fleet is truly integrated into that of the 
Community. 
  In order to finish the enlargement negotiations a compromise 
still has to be found regarding the most difficult topic, 
institutional reform, the minority blocking vote. Concerning 
this issue, Solana hopes to reach an interrim and balanced 
formula. Over to Pedro Fernandez Cespedes. 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] Good evening. The Spanish foreign 
minister believes it probable that there will be an agreement 
next Tuesday [22 March] concerning the blocking minority because 
he hopes that a compromise formula will succeed. It will be 
somewhere between that of the other Community members who favor 
the figure of 27 votes to block a Community decision and the 
Spanish position which goes along with the 27 votes but wants to 
keep the figure 23 for certain topics as long as the 23 
represent three countries with more than 100 million Community 
citizens. 
  There are difficult days of negotiations ahead, days when 
Spain will be alone says the minister, Javier Solana, but the 
negotiations are going to be full of hope. 
  [Begin Solana recording] We have a constructive spirit, we 
want to defend our interests and a certain type of European 
construction. But we are working constructively. If the others 
also work in this constructive fashion, I am sure we will find a 
solution. [end Solana recording] 
  [Fernandez Cespedes] Javier Solana believes that Spain is 
now 
stronger after the fishing negotiation with Norway, a 
negotiation that has proved useful for Portugal too. He 
believes that we have met with the understanding and the respect 
of our Community partners and that we do not have to trumpet our 
triumphs as Norway does, because we are not under pressure of a 
referendum. 
  [Begin Solana recording] We do not need that. We can speak 
clearly, without exaggerating or making a song and dance about 
it all. We have negotiated well, we did as well as possible. 
We tried to defend the interests of our country and I think we 
have managed to do so. [end Solana recording]

Minister for Euro-American Affairs Mahmoud Vaezi here today said 
that the understandings reached between Iran and Spain could 
outline brighter horizons in the mutual cooperation. 
  Vaezi in a meeting with Spanish Minister of State for 
International Cooperation Jose Luis Dicenta Ballester also 
expressed hope that the draft protocol on the two countries' 
cultural cooperation would be signed during the future visit of 
Ballester to Tehran. 
  Ballester replied that his country carefully follows up the 
issues relevant to Iran as an important country in the Persian 
Gulf region. 
  In addition to mutual cooperation, Spain and Iran have 
common 
interests in certain global issues, which he said can prepare 
the grounds for constructive cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Spain is willing to have active contribution road, airport 
and power generation projects in Iran, Ballester said. 
  Vaezi arrived here Monday [14 March] on a three day official 
visit.

  [Text] Madrid, March, 16, IRNA -- Visiting Iranian Deputy 
Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi and Deputy Minister of Transport 
and Environment Antonio Llardan have discussed ways of speeding 
up the establishment of Madrid-Tehran air link and finalizing a 
surface transport agreement between the two countries. 
  In a meeting held here Tuesday night [15 March], the two 
officials described as "friendly" bilateral relations and 
explored new avenues for expansion of mutual relations in 
various fields. 
  The Spanish official announced Madrid's readiness for 
participating in various Iranian economic projects. 
  Outlining economic and commercial policies of Iran, Va'ezi, 
welcomed Madrid's willingness to help in implementing economic 
projects in Iran. 
  Also on Tuesday, the Iranian official held talks with 
Spanish 
Foreign Ministry Director General Francisco Villar on issues of 
mutual interests as well as regional and international crises. 
  Calling for promotion of Tehran-Madrid cooperation, Villar

stressed the need for providing further facilities for Spanish 
investors to invest in Iran.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Paz: "Gonzalez Brings Renewalists Together </F>
Again Before Congress"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez met again with the top 
renewalist leaders at the Moncloa Palace yesterday in order to 
clarify all the issues concerning the upcoming PSOE [Spanish 
Socialist Workers Party] congress, which they began to analyze 
at their meeting on 25 February. Those summoned were the same 
people who attended the previous meeting: Narcis Serra, Manuel 
Chaves, Joan Lerma, Jose Bono, Joaquin Leguina, Ramon Jauregui, 
Jesus Quijano, Joaquin Almunia, and Rosa Conde, although Basque 
Socialist Party Secretary General Jauregui, who is on a visit to 
Argentina, was absent yesterday afternoon. 
  Some 10 days from the start of the congress, which will be 
held in Madrid 18-20 March, Gonzalez and the renewalist leaders, 
who account for 70 percent of the delegates to that meeting, 
analyzed in greater detail the contents of the 7,200 amendments 
to the framework report. The amendments were reviewed in order 
to see which deserve to be incorporated into [congress] 
resolutions and which should be watched in order to prevent 
approval of proposals that point to alleged discrepancies 
between party aims and government policy -- a temptation to 
which, in the opinion of those present, the Guerraists could 
succumb. To this end, in addition to the opinions the report 
writers, Felipe Gonzalez asked Joaquin Almunia, Alejandro 
Cercas, and Jose Rodriguez de la Borbolla, among others, to 
assess that document, several of those present told LA 
VANGUARDIA. 
  The PSOE secretary general, who still has not met with the 
Guerraist leaders although he speaks daily with Organization 
Secretary Jose Maria Benegas, took note of the opinions and the 
names which the renewalist leaders had suggested to him for 
membership of the presiding committee--which will direct the 
congress proceedings. [Renewalist leaders aalso suggested] 
possible chairmen of the reporting committees, rapporteurs, and 
even of people who could be on the future Executive Committee. 
Thus the list of candidates for the presiding committee which 
Gonzalez will present to the 888 delegates will include 
Sevillian Amparo Rubiales for deputy chairman, in addition to 
Lerma for chairman. The Socialists' top leader hopes there 
will be a consensus for this proposal, and that the election of 
the presiding committee -- the first vote of the congress -- 
will not serve as a pretext for confrontation between the 
sectors. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Popular Party Secretary Mino </F>
Martinazzoli by Antonio Padellaro in Brescia; date not given: 
"They Cannot Win, So I Will" -- first two paragraphs are 
L'ESPRESSO introduction] 
  [Text] First, Mino Martinazzoli protested: "There is a 
conspiracy of silence against the center, and I wonder why so 
many newspaper commentators, including some authoritative ones, 
are still writing -- and in so doing stating something that is 
clearly untrue -- that the 27 March electoral race will be 
contested only by [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi's 
right and [Achille] Occhetto's [Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS] left." But why should the newspapers conceal the truth? 
"Perhaps because of the cynicism of the financial groups behind 
the major sectors of the press." Does he think that the center 
can win? "I say that the race is still on. There are still a 
large number of unknown factors." 
  Enveloped in a blue haze of smoke from his Muratti 
cigarette, 
Martinazzoli knows that he cannot do much to cloud the reality 
of the election forecasts. According to the opinion polls, his 
Popular Party [PPI], at best, is worth 12 percent. This, 
together with the 6 percent from [Mario] Segni's Pact for Italy, 
would seem to lend strength to the arguments of those who, 
whether out of opportunism or for other reasons, prefer not to 
bet on the center. And even though from here (we were in 
Brescia, in a prosperous attorney's office which it would be 
ridiculous to compare to the grandeur of Arcore [Berlusconi's 
home]), Rome looks like a front abandoned to the overwhelming 
strength of the enemy, the PPI secretary does have a strategy. 
He explained it to L'ESPRESSO, pointing out that the first rule 
is not to overestimate your adversaries. Starting with Achille 
Occhetto who, Martinazzoli said, "inebriated by the results of 
the November and December local elections and, among other 
things, ignoring the fact that they were held under different 
electoral mechanisms, has believed that the same pattern could 
be reproduced in the general election." 
  [Padellaro] Whereas? 
  [Martinazzoli] Whereas Occhetto will probably lose. But 
above all, by so doing, he has not helped the development of the 
Italian political system. And he has not fulfilled his ambition 
to really build a democratic left, freed from the old origins of 
the PCI [Italian Communist Party]. 
  [Padellaro] Could you be more specific in your charges? 
  [Martinazzoli] A party, the PDS, that solemnly declared that 
it wanted to distance itself from its origins should not have 
got together again with that part of it, Communist Renewal, that 
did not accept that challenge. And neither should it have 
permitted such a movement as Rete to characterize the ideology 
of the so-called progressive alignment in such a marked way. 
The representatives of the left are seeking votes on the basis 
of their guarantee that they are no longer what they were in the 
past. But they are unable to say what they are now. 
  [Padellaro] What about Berlusconi? He seems unstoppable. 
  [Martinazzoli] Forza Italia is exploiting the draw of the 
television message and its power of suggestion. It is no 
coincidence that, as far as can be gathered, it is mainly women 
and young people that are captivated by the image that 
Berlusconi is able to project. He may be victorious in those 
sectors that have fewest social reference points. We certainly 
have candidates that have a more direct relationship with their 
environment. 
  [Padellaro] But who are Berlusconi's potential voters? 
  [Martinazzoli] They are certainly people who want a little 
more order and a few more certainties. They are outraged by the 
political corruption. Deep down, they have always nurtured a 
certain mistrust of politics. They are people who identify with 
the figure represented by Berlusconi and who regard him almost 
as an avenger against the attitudes and behavior of professional 
politicians. And by virtue of this identification, they expect 
an immediate appropriation of the political dimension. 
  [Padellaro] Is their confidence well placed? 
  [Martinazzoli] When I think about Berlusconi, I feel 
prompted 
to say that politics concerns not your own affairs, but those of 
others. I would add that, in general, those who are too 
successful in their own affairs are rather neglectful of other 
people's. 
  [Padellaro] So was it what we could call this difference of 
mentality that prevented an election agreement between you and 
Berlusconi? 
  [Martinazzoli] When I went to visit him around Christmas he 
presented me with the logic of the abacus. He told me, there is 
the left which is all united, and we must unite everything other 
than that. Perhaps I failed to understand that what was at 
stake was a victory by the left-wing forces in our country. I 
replied to him that the arithmetical logic of the abacus would 
have defeated even our traditional reservations about the MSI 
[Italian Social Movement]. I tried to explain to him that we 
have been part of Italian history since 1919. We saw Mussolini 
win, and we saw many Popular Party members who considered it 
more realistic to side with him. Sturzo, however, preferred to 
go into exile, and it was in exile that [Alcide] de Gasperi's DC 
[Christian Democratic Party] gained its legitimacy. True, 
between Berlusconi and me there was not merely a tactical lack 
of understanding, but an acknowledgment that our respective 
visions of politics were incompatible. But he knew that 
already, and had prepared himself in time. 
  [Padellaro] Why do you think that? 
  [Martinazzoli] The fact is that Berlusconi had decided to 
enter the arena some time before. Otherwise, why would he have 
tried to scale down [Northern League Secretary Umberto] Bossi's 
leadership? And why would he have encouraged and helped the 
mini-split within the PPI by Casini and company? 
  [Padellaro] Are you worried about the prospect of 
Berlusconi's becoming prime minister? 
  [Martinazzoli] Probably in the United States too, on the eve 
of Reagan's victory, some intellectuals may not have been happy 
about the idea of a Hollywood actor's becoming president. 
Later, however, Reagan showed that he possessed certain 
capabilities. The problem with Berlusconi, rather, is that he 
is someone who has closely involved his business with politics, 
though he now portrays himself as a hero of the free market. 
Certainly I feel like laughing when I read, on the subject of 
the composition of the next government, that Berlusconi's 
orchestra or [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni's 
band will include a woman judge whose job will be to organize 
her former colleagues. 
  [Padellaro] Are you not talking that way out of envy for 
Berlusconi's political successes? 
  [Martinazzoli] It may be that I display the complex of the 
nobleman in decline, but permit me to draw a parallel, albeit an 
apparently unpleasant one. The judiciary will decide on the 
matter of [former Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi's 
criminal responsibilities, though his political faults are in 
any case clear. But I was a minister in a government of which 
Craxi was prime minister, and Craxi was a politician who did 
have some political ideas, and that is a fact. The destruction 
of the race of politicians and their massacre is a price that we 
have to pay for the faults that they committed, but it is 
certainly not the remedy to all this country's ills. 
  [Padellaro] Some people say that the errors that led to the 
elimination of several of the Popular and Pact candidates were 
no accident. And that in fact they conceal a maneuver on the 
part of the sector of the former DC which, deep down, supports 
Forza Italia. It is also said that cooperation between you and 
Segni is not always of the best. Is this so? 
  [Martinazzoli] No, it seems to me that in Latium, which is 
where we had the biggest problems, an error was made in the 
interpretation of the law, which is in any case a kind of trap. 
Certainly, at the local level there were some misunderstandings 
with Segni's people. We had situations in central Italy where 
the Pact first demanded certain constituencies for their own 
candidates and then, the next day, decided not to gather 
signatures. I am not blaming Segni for this, but the fact is 
that he has some local officials, often former Christian 
Democrats, who, like all those who have left, maintain difficult 
relations with us. It is not an intolerable problem, but it is 
a problem. 
  [Padellaro] You are very critical of Occhetto and 
Berlusconi. 
After the elections, however, the center may be forced to ally 
with one or the other. 
  [Martinazzoli] We could also go into opposition. But if 
nobody is victorious, the problem of alliances will arise for 
all the forces. In a situation in which the absence of a 
victory by the left or the right destroys these schemes, it is 
we who will be the point of attraction. We are arrogant enough 
to think that it is the others that will offer us an agreement. 
  [Padellaro] An agreement for what kind of government? 
  [Martinazzoli] I see no chance of continuing with a 
government of experts. I think that we must act on the lesson 
that we learned from the Ciampi government, namely, that the 
more skills, seriousness of purpose, and impartiality there are 
in a government, the better it is for everyone. This, even 
though I hope that Ciampi will remember to make it clear to the 
Italian people that it is we and the others who enabled him to 
govern well. But I fear that we no longer need a politically 
neutral government, if we consider the complexity of our new 
problems. In past months there has been a revival in Europe of 
major wars and of grand diplomacy to build industrial alliances 
that will later be brought to bear in the subsequent stage of 
the European market and in economic competition with America. 
Will our iron and steel industry look toward France or Germany? 
And how will the automobile industry resolve its problems? We 
also need a government that is equal to the complexity of the 
constitutional problems -- a constituent government, therefore, 
that will tackle first and foremost the problem of federalism 
and that can complete the electoral reform. 
  [Padellaro] A reform to introduce a two-round system? 
  [Martinazzoli] Yes, though, rather than runoffs, a 
French-style open system would be preferable. 
  [Padellaro] A new system with which to hold another election 
soon? 
  [Martinazzoli]That remains to be seen.

  [Text] There is to be tighter security around Messina's 
Palace of Justice and for some of the judges who are said to be 
Mafia targets. These were the decisions made by the Committee 
for Order and Security which met in the Messina Prefect's Office. 
  The meeting follows the news that the mafia has made plans 
to 
kill, among others, Judge Antonio Di Pietro. In particular, the 
bosses are said to have set aside 500 million lire for the 
project. The operation was revealed to investigators by the 
supergrass, Luigi Sparacio, whose tesitmony has led to the 
arrest of dozens of people during the last few months.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liliana Ferraro, Italian director of </F>
criminal affairs, by Richard Heuze in Rome; date not given: 
"Liliana Ferraro Draws Conclusions From Aix Summit -- `A World 
Conference on the Mafia'"] 
  [Text] [Heuze] Following the French-Italian meeting in 
Aix-en-Provence, are you pleased with the ground covered by 
international collaboration against the Mafia? 
  [Ferraro] It is not always easy to measure the amount of 
ground covered. The countries involved in the discussions have 
very different crime situations. It is therefore normal that 
they take widely varying approaches to the phenomenon. Having 
said that, we have taken a great step forward, both on the 
bilateral level, at Aix, and on the level of the European 
Community in the working group on organized crime set up in 
association with the interior and justice ministers. 
  [Heuze] What is your opinion of Franco-Italian cooperation 
in 
this area? 
  [Ferraro] For a year and a half we have been working in 
close 
harmony. Michel Debach, a French judge, is permanently attached 
to the Criminal Affairs Department of our Justice Ministry. 
That has simplified relations between our two administrations 
and has made dossier processing more efficient and more 
flexible. The Aix meeting was also very productive. 
  [Heuze] In what respect? 
  [Ferraro] It is encouraging to note that major progress has 
been made in Europe in how this phenomenon, which unfortunately 
is not solely an Italian problem, is viewed. We have to 
understand that, when one country strengthens its fight against 
organized crime, as Italy has done for some time now, the 
Mafiosi can very easily set up in another country and continue 
their activities. That is a phenomenon requiring action from all 
the countries of Europe. 
  [Heuze] Not all criminals are Mafiosi, though... 
  [Ferraro] When we speak of the Mafia, we are referring to a 
group of criminals who organize themselves for criminal activity 
of whatever type. When you consider the aggressiveness of these 
organizations, in Italy and elsewhere, and the extent of their 
resources, you realize how much of a risk we would run by not 
immediately taking measures to try and curb their penetration. 
At Aix, for example, my colleagues explained that, due to the 
fact that we in Italy did not realize in time this scourge's 
extraordinary capacity for expansion, the Mafia was able to 
leave its traditional habitat (Sicily, Calabria, and the Naples 
region) and spread outward. 
  [Heuze] Do you believe that France is aware of this? 
  [Ferraro] I think that the measures that [French Justice 
Minister] Pierre Mehaignerie wants to implement are very 
important, such as judges specializing in organized crime and 
the creation of a centralized structure. 
  [Heuze] Italy has a whole legal arsenal designed to fight 
the 
Mafia. What are its main features? 
  [Ferraro] Firstly, there is the law of 1982 which 
establishes 
the notion of a "Mafia-type criminal association." Then there 
are the laws governing repentants, drugs -- enabling undercover 
operations -- and telephone bugging. Also, an anti-Mafia 
investigation department was set up which made it possible to 
assemble a body of specialist police officers in a centralized 
structure. Then there are all the legal adjustments that were 
adopted subsequently in the light of the constantly shifting 
crime situation. That was how we were able to sequester 
considerable Mafia assets. When you take a clan chief's money 
away from him, you remove almost all his power. We also spoke 
in Aix of the need to establish stricter penalties against 
people who have been prosecuted and found guilty of Mafia 
activity. 
  [Heuze] Do you want other European countries to bring their 
legislation in line with your laws? 
  [Ferraro] That is the main thing. It would also be good if 
the laws governing informers and the confiscation of property 
were adopted by other countries. 
  [Heuze] Is the Mafia present in France? 
  [Ferraro] Of course. Mafiosi -- mostly from the Camorra 
group -- have taken refuge is a number of regions. We have 
witnessed this through joint police operations such as the Green 
Tide operation. At Aix, Prefect Mancuso, the Naples prosecutor, 
reiterated that there had been links going back to 1984 between 
the Marseilles underworld and the Camorra. Moreover, since 
Michele Zeza was not just a Camorrist but also had ties with the 
Mafia, his presence on the Cote d`Azur was not just a 
coincidence -- as Judge Falcone said: "There are no coincidences 
in the Mafia" -- obviously he was there "on business." Each 
time there is an easy opportunity to make major property or 
capital investments, the dirty money rushes in. Knowledge of 
this phenomenon should force us to take steps in due course. 
  [Heuze] Do you think the Mafia was involved in the murder of 
Yann Piat? 
  [Ferraro] There are no clues to indicate that. Anyway, we 
did not touch on that specific subject at Aix. 
  [Heuze] Italy has proposed a UN conference on organized 
crime. What will be the aims of this conference? 
  [Ferraro] This conference will be held in Naples from 24 to 
26 October. It will not aim to examine the phenomenon of crime 
on a world scale, but should enable the world's governments to 
compare their legislations. Organized crime is the number-one 
enemy of democracy. It tries to take control on the ground and 
corrupt local authority and the financial markets. It aims at 
preventing democracies from autonomously governing public life. 
We propose making the world fight against the Mafia more 
incisive and examining together how we can prevent dirty money 
laundering. It will then be up to each government to implement 
the measures it deems necessary. The main thing is to face these 
problems on a world level.

  [Text] Verona, Italy, March 17 (AFP) -- Right-wing Italian 
leader Franco Freda and 69 others have been charged with trying 
to set up a fascist party in violation of anti-discrimination 
laws, judicial sources said here Thursday [17 March]. 
  Freda, who heads the National Front party, was charged with 
spreading racist and fascist ideas following a nine-month 
investigation. 
  The fascist party has been banned in Italy since the end of 
World War II. 
  Freda had previously been charged for his alleged role in a 
terrorist attack in Milan on December 12, 1969, in which 16 
people died and 107 were injured. 
  He was acquitted of the charges by an appeals court in 1985.

political asylum. The house approved giving the police rather 
than a judge the right to decide whether to expel asylum-seekers 
who try to stay in Switzerland illegally, or hold them in 
detention. The new law will come into force in July. The house 
also passed a series of recommendations aimed at boosting 
cooperation and understanding between the different language

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Jan Klenberg: `NATO Membership Would </F>
Drastically Change Our Security Position'"] 
  [Text] In the view of Jan Klenberg, commander of the 
Finnish Armed Forces, the possible membership of Finland in the 
European Union [EU] is also a security issue. Membership would 
include Finland in the EU's economic and social policy decisions 
and would also have an effect on security policy issues. 
  "From a standpoint of military security, this change would 
not appear to significantly affect Russia's position as 
Finland's neighbor, nor does it effect Finland's position as 
Russia's neighbor," said Klenberg, in a speech, last Monday [14 
February] in Tampere. 
  According to Klenberg, a possible peace partnership with 
NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], or serving as 
an observer within the WEU [Western European Union], should not 
change Finland's security situation. On the other hand, if 
Finland chose to join NATO or the WEU, that would drastically 
change Finland's military security status. 
  Klenberg feels that it is uncertain whether the CFE 
[Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] agreement, concerning 
limiting conventional weapons in Europe, will become effective 
in the areas surrounding Finland. 
  In Klenberg's view, the CFE agreement has reached "an 
interesting stage." 
  "At this stage, it appears that the implementation of 
regulations regarding peripheral areas is in the danger zone," 
concluded Klenberg.

<F P=106> [Guest commentary by Markku Salomaa: "Defense of the EU </F>
Based on Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] Finland must reevaluate the strengths and weaknesses 
of its policy toward nuclear arms. 
  By joining the EU [European Union], Finland would enter the 
era of nuclear arms strategy, but this should not be the sole 
reason for voting against membership, writes Markku Salomaa. 
  The writer has a doctorate in political science and is a 
researcher with the Academy of Finland. 
  With the common defense of the EU, Finland would also 
receive 
the protection of the nuclear umbrella of the West. But at the 
same time, Finland would end up as a target for the opposing 
side. 
  Although Finland would not have interests that would require 
a nuclear deterrent, such interests would develop for Europe, 
the superpower. 
  Should Finland become a member of the EU, its security 
policy 
will face greater changes than at any time since the country 
became independent if the EU chooses to integrate its defense. A 
common strategy will provide a strong push toward a nuclear arms 
strategy. 
  The Union expects from its members total commitment to all 
aspects of its development plans, and it will not permit 
neutrality or "nonalliance," as expressed in the Commission's 
Report as early as 25 May 1992. No one can enjoy the benefits of 
the Union without being (totally) committed oneself. 
  The defense political development of the Union can only mean 
the building of common security based on nuclear arms, as they 
already provide the core of French and British defense. 
Conventional military might only complements the nuclear 
deterrents. Conventional forces could be kept fairly small -- as 
long as their quality is high -- in order to be able to handle 
smaller scale regional operations 
<H5>  Nuclear Powers Not Content With Conventional Weapons </H5>
  The current nuclear powers are not willing, under any 
circumstances, to relinquish the core of their defense. They are 
unwilling to take the risk of establishing nuclear-free zones 
and having to rely on conventional weapons. That would become 
even more expensive than nuclear weapons. 
  These are the realities we have to face if Finland is a 
member of the Union in 1996, and a debate commences regarding 
security and defense policies, as well as the decisions involved 
in such. Although defense policy decisions by the Council of 
Ministers would require consensus, the remaining question is, 
what authority do the different bodies of the Union exert on the 
use of nuclear weapons by the member countries. 
  Ultimately the decision to use nuclear weapons has 
previously 
been, and is now, made by each country's military leadership. 
The French nuclear arms doctrine is based on just this tenet. 
Thus the doctrine of the Union will probably resemble the one 
held by NATO. Finland's options regarding nuclear arms and 
foreign forces would only apply during peacetime. 
  In addition, the new doctrine espoused by NATO, the United 
States, and also Russia, openly expresses a preparedness to use 
nuclear arms for a first strike. The real nuclear strike 
threshold has been high and is now even higher. The threat of a 
first strike is necessary for the establishment of a nuclear 
deterrent effect. 
  Although Russia, in its military doctrine made public last 
November, expressed the commitment not to use nuclear weapons 
against nations who are signatories to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and who have no nuclear arsenals of 
their own, this promise also has some exceptions. 
  A country that has no nuclear weapons can also become a 
target if it has an alliance with a nuclear power. This doctrine 
would put all members of the Union in the same basket, without 
any special exceptions. 
  The Russian doctrine lists as potential threats, which would 
entitle the country to launch military operations across its 
borders, the expansion of "military blocks and alliances" in a 
manner that would constitute a threat to the military and 
security interests of the Russian Federation. This would include 
the establishment of foreign troops and weapons systems in a 
neighboring country, where they have not been located before. 
  Among the threat scenarios is also listed "the suppression 
abroad of the benefits, freedoms, and lawful rights of citizens 
of the Russian Federation." This item does not only apply to the 
Baltic states. 
  The continued uncertainty in Russia's internal affairs is 
apt 
to keep familiar doubts alive in all areas bordering on Russia. 
The impending Russian presidential election brings its own 
sources of doubts. The exceptional power wielded by the Russian 
president's office may constitute a problem. 
<H5>  Russia's Military Tenets Also Carried Out in Reality </H5>
  For many of these reasons, NATO has maintained its basic 
level of preparedness on essentially the same level as before, 
and the organization has not agreed to let the United States 
withdraw all its troops. Russia is also slowing down the 
reductions in military personnel, and is, on the contrary, 
increasing the size of its Armed Forces. 
  The new Russian military doctrine is not simply a piece of 
paper; the country has started to implement all facets of it. 
  Finnish military policy decisions should be based on 
strategic considerations and not imagined views. The issue is 
complicated and difficult because it is so heavily charged with 
emotion. Membership in the Union should not be rejected for this 
reason alone, but one should be familiar with all the scenarios 
involved. 
  One of the realities is also the fact that no sacrifices 
made 
by us towards conventional military forces would provide as 
effective a deterrent as nuclear arms. In addition, if a 
convential war were to erupt, our country would immediately be 
on the frontline. 
  And finally, in spite of all doubts, a European nuclear 
umbrella would benefit Finland. Therefore, it is time for us to 
objectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a nuclear 
armament policy.

<F P=106> [Katarina Koivisto report: "Economic Issues Dominate </F>
Chernomyrdin Visit"] 
  [Text] Economic issues topped the agenda on the first day 
of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to 
Finland. Finnish trade politicians and Finnish industry can now 
look forward to resuming work within the mixed Finnish-Russian 
economic commission. One of the first tasks of the new 
commission will be to review the impact of possible Finnish EU 
membership on bilateral trade relations between Finland and 
Russia. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin assured journalists, 
however, that Russia's attitude to Finnish membership of the EU 
is frankly positive, but he stressed the importance of 
safeguarding bilateral relations in trade and industry despite 
possible Finnish membership. 
  Economic issues also dominated talks between Prime Ministers 
Esko Aho and Chernomyrdin. Aho stated that he was pleased to 
see that the mixed economic committee can resume its work. This 
will make it possible to resolve several practical problems. 
Aho and Chernomyrdin also discussed Finnish participation in 
Russian industrial projects, especially in the raw-materials 
sector. Natural gas and cooperation in this area was a subject 
of great interest, according to Aho. The only incident at 
Friday's [11 March] news conference arose when a journalist 
asked whether Russia wishes to alter the border fixed by the 
Paris treaty after World War II. Russia's Ambassador to Finland 
Yuriy Deryabin had to stand up and explain to Chernomyrdin what 
he had meant by his statements about the Paris treaty, whereupon 
Chernomyrdin made the point that discussing cooperation in the 
neighboring border areas is more important than changing borders. 
<H5>  Weapons as Partial Payment </H5>
  One of the agreements signed on Friday concerns supplies of 
Russian arms in payment for a debt of about 500 million Markka, 
which has been on a special Bank of Finland account since the 
time of the bilateral clearing trade. The account was 
established at a time when the trade imbalance was critical, 
with the intention of allowing the Soviet Union to amortize it 
by small installments. But the account is still there. Aho 
thinks that weapons supplies are an excellent idea and that they 
can also be discussed as a means of repaying other debts. 
  At his meeting with the representatives of Finnish industry, 
Chernomyrdin stated that the worst crisis in trade was now over. 
The volume of trade has begun to rise, but there are still 
Finnish claims worth 6 billion Markka dating back to the 
bilateral clearing trade. Of that amount the industry has 
nearly 0.5 billion Markka worth of claims without any collateral. 
  Russian foreign debts are great, Chernomyrdin said, but he 
pointed out that, although 6 billion Markka is a large amount, 
it is still only a fraction of the total Russian debt. This 
issue has therefore not been given priority treatment. 
  "We have begun to pay back our debt through weapons supplies 
as a means of reimbursing the debt on the special account. This 
is a first step and Finland will get its money back, although 
negotiations for any remaining outstanding credits will be take 
place through other channels." Finland will negotiate 
state-guaranteed credits together with other Western countries 
at the so-called Paris Club, whereas Western banks will 
negotiate their claims jointly via the London Club. 
<H5>  The New and Old Mixed Commission </H5>
  Participating in the meeting with representatives of 
industry 
was Russian Foreign Trade Minister Oleg Davidov, who has been 
appointed chairman of the Russian half of the mixed economic 
commission. The nature of the commission has changed since the 
Soviet period, but it is still regarded as an important 
discussion forum. It has, however, not been able to work 
effectively while being without a Russian chairman for a longer 
period. Prime Minister Aho hopes that the commission will now 
be able to resolve some open trade questions. Chernomyrdin 
assured journalists that economic reform in Russia will continue 
and that Russia is planning to modify and facilitate its foreign 
trade while safeguarding Russian interests in both import and 
export. The problems are still great, but the direction is 
right, the prime minister stated. He added that there are plans 
for several industrial projects in which a need for 
Finnish-Russian cooperation may arise. 
<H5>  Many Plans </H5>
  Representatives of Finnish enterprises presented their own 
plans on cooperation during a meeting with Chernomyrdin lasting 
over an hour. Metra discussed its diesel engine plant in St. 
Petersburg, which is nearing completion and which the company 
wants to see operational as soon as possible. Rautaruukki 
touched on the prospects of delivering the remainder of 
Trabstech's special wagons to Russia, and Outokumpu put forward 
its views on metallurgical cooperation on the Kola peninsula. 
Valmet has new plans for cooperation in the vehicle component 
sector in St. Petersburg. 
<H5>  Several Agreements </H5>
  During the first day of his visit, the Russian prime 
minister 
met with President Ahtisaari, whom he briefed on Russia's 
economic and political situation. Friday also saw the signing 
of four bilateral agreements. One of them is to allow frontier 
crossing at other than official crossing points for purposes of 
trade and transport. Then there is an agreement on cooperation 
between the two countries' customs administrations to prevent 
customs violations. Two other agreements concern fish and 
cooperation in post and telecommunication services. 
  Today Chernomyrdin is to visit Neste, the state-owned energy 
company, to witness the signing of several natural gas 
agreements, including one on increased deliveries of natural gas 
to Finland.

<F P=106> [Article by Pentti Laitinen: "Soviet Trade Guaranties Forced </F>
Guaranty Agency Into the Red"] 
  [Text] The total loss experienced by the Foreign Trade 
Credit Guaranty Agency amounted to 572 million markkas [FMk], of 
which the largest portion can be attributed to credit guaranties 
issued for trade deals with the former USSR, for which payments 
are now overdue. Another single item that strongly affects the 
bottom line of the Credit Guaranty Agency is the annual payment 
pertaining to the settlement of Wartsila Meriteollisuus. 
  The export recovery increased the demand for the agency's 
services by more than 25 percent. The agency's total guaranty 
commitment for last year was FMk53 billion, of which the export 
guaranties' share was 86 percent. 
  The objective of the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency 
has 
been defined as the promotion of exports and strengthening the 
operating conditions of small and medium-size industry. The 
tools available to the agency to further these goals are export 
guaranties and state guaranties, which can be granted to 
businesses and financiers. 
<H5>  Credit Guaranty Payments -- 145 Million </H5>
  Compensation received from state guaranties and export 
guaranties amounted to FMk145 million. Based on these, the 
Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency paid FMk206 million in 
compensation. This was FMk72 million less than in 1992. The 
guaranties issued for trade with the former USSR resulted in 
compensation payments of FMk536 million. 
  On the other hand, last year the compensation transfers 
involving Wartsila Meriteollisuus showed in the books of the 
Credit Guaranty Agency as a revenue of FMk65 million, which was 
unusual. The outstanding amounts have been factored, and during 
the legal proceedings, part of the compensation paid was 
returned. 
  This spring the Credit Guaranty Agency will close its books 
on an accrual basis, and the outstanding debts will be estimated 
in the same manner as insurance companies do when they close 
their books. This is expected to provide a clearer picture of 
the agency's cash flow than the currently used cash-based 
accounting system. 
<H5>  3 Billion Total Liabilities </H5>
  At the beginning of last year, the total liability for trade 
with the USSR was less than FMk3 billion, which had accrued 
during the 1980's as a result of long-term financing. The Credit 
Guaranty Agency submits payments for interest and principal to 
the banks as they become due . 
  The loans will later be collected from Russia, in a manner 
which will be determined by the international conference of 
creditors or the so-called Paris Club. 
  The Paris Club is planning to extend long-term credit and 
low 
interest rates for trade with the East. Due to the fact that the 
procedures for collecting these debts have still not been set in 
place, it has not been possible to carry them forward. 
  According to Matti Vuoria, section head and chair of the 
board of directors for the Foreign Trade Credit Guaranty Agency, 
there is also great demand for new guaranties for trade with 
Russia, "but the decisions must wait until the creditor 
countries have made their final decision regarding debt 
consolidation." 
  According to CEO Ilkka Niemi, the Credit Guaranty Agency's 
opportunities to conduct business are not dependent upon the 
methods of collecting outstanding debts, which are accrued from 
trade with the East. At the beginning of the current year, the 
book risk ceiling of export guaranties was increased to FMk45 
billion. According to Niemi, this allows for FMk70 billion in 
trade guaranties. Also, according to Niemi, disregarding the 
credits issued for the trade with the former USSR and the 
commitments to Wartsila Meriteollisuus' incidental traffic, the 
profits generated by the Credit Guaranty Agency are on a good 
international level. Balancing the approximately FMk200 million 
in other compensation are FMk145 million of guaranty payments. 
  During the year, the metal industry has greatly increased 
its 
share of export guaranties, and its share of all guaranties is 
now 65 percent. The strongest growth for export guaranties was 
to the Far East, where China is rapidly becoming the largest 
target for export guaranties. 
<H5>  Slight Decrease in Estonia's Risk Level </H5>
  So far, guaranties have not been issued to Baltic states, 
which were formerly part of the USSR. However, the agency's 
board of directors decided last Thursday [10 February] to adjust 
Estonia's risk rating to the extent that short-term letters of 
credit could be guaranteed. 
  According to Ilkka Niemi, small and medium-size businesses 
are beginning to learn how to utilize various forms of state 
guaranties. Starting last July, the Credit Guaranty Agency began 
issuing special debt consolidation credits to businesses that 
are in debt but considered viable. The agency has received 
consolidation applications valued at FMk1.3 billion in credits. 
<H5>  Banks Eager To Transfer Risk </H5>
  Banks have shown an eagerness to transfer risks for 
individual companies to the Credit Guaranty Agency. In 
connection with debt consolidation guaranties, the commercial 
bank maintains half of the risk, and counterguaranties are 
divided the same way. 
  Last year, small and medium-size businesses received 
financing guaranties that amounted to a total of FMk917 million.

<F P=106> [Bo Andersson report: "Swedish UN Troops Criticize Defense </F>
Department"] 
  [Text] Fifteen officers in the Swedish UN battalion in 
Macedonia [The Fomer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
have written a joint letter to their Defense Ministry (UD) 
complaining about its inadequate personnel policy. The Swedish 
UN troops say that they have been given no information whatever 
about the possibility of the battalion moving to Bosnia. 
  "After all, it is people who are involved here, not a flock 
of sheep that can be moved around here and there without being 
informed or consulted," the officers write. 
  Even Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas was criticized by 
the Swedish UN command. She was on a tour of the former 
Yugoslavia last week when Sweden was asked by the United Nations 
whether the troops in Macedonia could be deployed to reinforce 
the troops stationed in Bosnia. 
  The day after being informed about the inquiry, Mrs. af 
Ugglas inspected that very battalion in Macedonia. According to 
the officers, she did not utter a single word about the 
sensitive political discussions which were going on between 
Sweden and the United Nations. "The foreign minister touched on 
the matter with the battalion's commanders. She said that it 
was not her business to pass any information to the soldiers," 
Staffan Bjork at the UD's press office said. The officers who 
wrote the protest letter belong to the battalion of Swedish 
riflemen in Macedonia. They were informed by family members in 
Sweden that they might be moving to Bosnia. 
  The defense staff is responsible for providing the Swedish 
UN 
forces with operational information. The press chief there, 
Bertil Tennert, is aware of the officers' criticisms and claims 
to understand the climate of uncertainty in which the soldiers 
are living: "We had thought of releasing the information, but 
news leaked out very quickly in New York. We did not succeed in 
getting our act together." Kjell Gothe, Defense Minister Anders 
Bjorck's spokesman, gave roughly the same explanation on the 
failure to provide information.

<F P=106> [Mats Poulsen report: "`Fear of Eastern Mafia Exaggerated' </F>
Says SAPO"] 
  [Text] Reports about crime against enterprises in the 
Baltic states and Russia are grossly exaggerated. Police 
liaison officers working in Tallin, St. Petersburg, and Moscow 
for half a year have only reported minor incidents. This 
assertion was made by a Swedish Security Police (SAPO) chief 
superintendent who does not wish to be identified. The security 
police addressed the audience of a well-visited seminar arranged 
by the Baltic Center foundation in Stockholm yesterday. 
  "I recommend all companies that are active in the Baltic 
states and Russia to contact our local police representatives. 
They can be reached via the embassies in Tallin and Moscow and 
the consulate in St. Petersburg. In May there will be a 
policeman posted to Riga as well," the security police 
representative said. 
  The businessmen at the seminar were eager to learn about the 
magnitude of the risks for businessmen in the East. "We 
recommend that you do not pay protection money. People who 
become exposed to protection gangs must contact us immediately 
for help," the police representative said. But after these 
words of comfort to the businessmen, the security officer 
painted an alarming picture of crime in the Baltic states and 
Russia. It is perfectly obvious that there are mafia-like gangs 
looking for profits in hard currency. They are often organized 
by former KGB officers and specialize in controlling specific 
areas like airports or dockyards. They defend their districts 
with outrageous violence. 
  The many murders reported from the Baltic states and Russia 
often relate to wars between various mafia gangs. It is 
dangerous for the police to intervene in these conflicts. In 
1990, as many as 364 policemen were killed in the former Soviet 
area, compared to five in the United States the same year. 
  Mafia activities have so far spread mainly to Poland and 
Germany. Berlin is indicated as a new center for the expanding 
East European mafia. Language differences are mentioned as one 
of the reasons why the mafia has still not gained a foothold in 
Sweden. But the authorities fear a wave of serious crime with 
offenses like drug smuggling, kidnapping, and money laundering, 
which have been taking place on a smaller scale.

  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
today began a four-day official visit to Cyprus--the first by a 
Greek national defense minister to Cyprus since political change 
[in Greece] in 1974. Arsenis will hold talks with President 
Glavkos Kliridhis and Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis 
with the aim of promoting the coordination of the Cyprus-Greece 
defense plans. 
  In a statement upon his arrival, Arsenis said he believed 
that Greece-Cyprus defense cooperation will lay firm foundations 
for a hopeful and peaceful course toward a just Cyprus solution 
and will revive the Cypriot people's sense of security. He also 
stressed that the defense doctrine was not a sudden inspiration 
but a political decision made by the two countries' political 
leaderships. The Greek national defense minister stressed that 
his feelings about being in Cyprus are accompanied by a sense of 
the major responsibility he feels for the purpose of his visit, 
which, he stated, is to help to realize the unified defense area 
doctrine. Arsenis also noted that in the next few days much work 
is expected to be done without any fuss but that will be 
practical, he said. 
  Welcoming Arsenis, Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis 
stressed that the Greek national defense minister's presence in 
Cyprus constitutes a very significant event for realizing the 
unified defense planning and gives substantive content to the 
decisions of the Greek and Cypriot Governments. 
  Arsenis was also welcomed by Greek Ambassador Alexandros 
Sandhis and National Guard Commander Lieutenant General Nikolaos 
Vorvolakos. A National Guard detachment consisting of all three 
branches presented arms. 
  Arsenis has already met President Kliridhis at the 
Presidential Palace. Kliridhis is now hosting a lunch in honor 
of Arsenis.

  [Text] Turkish agents could be responsible for the bomb 
explosion last night at a mosque near Faneromeni Church in 
Nicosia. This is the conclusion reached by the investigative 
authorities. Correspondent Yeoryios Platonos has the following 
report: 
  [Begin Platonos recording] The bomb that exploded last night 
on Lefkonos Street was made with a small quantity of high 
density explosive material and was placed on the outside wall of 
the mosque. The homemade device exploded at 2300. The Criminal 
Investigation Department [TAE] is evaluating information that 
Turkish agents are responsible for the explosion. It is 
believed that the Turks possibly came from the occupied areas to 
cause tension in view of the Cyprus issue talks. TAE is also 
studying the relation of this incident to the arrival of the 
Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis. Police last 
night visited and searched other mosques as a precautionary 
measure. A UN officer visited the area after the explosion, 
possibly after notification by the Turks. The explosion caused 
the shattering of windows of a nearby school and shops. [end

  [Text] The proximity talks on the confidence-building 
measures are continuing. A UN delegation headed by Gustav 
Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special envoy in 
Cyprus, met with a Turkish Cypriot delegation headed by 
President Rauf Denktas at the President's Office this afternoon. 
The meeting attended by Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy 
prime minister; Atay Ahmet Rasit, foreign affairs and defense 
minister; presidential advisers Necati Munir Ertekun and Onur 
Olgun; and Ozer Koray, Foreign Ministry under secretary from the 
Turkish Cypriot side and Feissel's aide John Paul Cavanaugh and 
other UN experts lasted for two and a half hours. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said the views and 
ideas that emerged as a result of the cabinet meeting this 
morning, taking into consideration the draft document, were 
explained to Feissel. Pointing out that views were exchanged on 
the draft, Denktas added that the UN delegation will be holding 
a meeting with Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis this afternoon. 
He noted that he will hold another meeting with the UN 
delegation on Friday morning [18 March]. Denktas noted that the 
necessary messages were relayed to the UN delegation, adding 
that it is out of the question to have a single gate at the 
Lefkosa [Nicosia] International Airport and that the agreement 
pertained to the inside of the airport. He said: We will 
naturally have a separate gate. If we want a separate customs 
check that is what we will have. In reply to another question, 
Denktas said procedures concerning the Turkish Cypriot side will 
be handled by Turkish Cypriots at the Lefkosa International 
Airport, and the procedures that will be performed by the others 
will be to stamp the passports of foreign tourists with the UN 
airport seal. In reply to a question by a Bayrak Radio and 
television correspondent on whether one could say that we are on 
the right track, Denktas said: We will meet again on Friday. 
  After the meeting Feissel refrained from giving concrete 
replies to correspondents' questions saying that views were 
exchanged on various ideas at today's long meeting and that 
there were many issues that should be discussed. Pointing out 
that the negotiating process has yet to be concluded, Feissel 
said: We will meet again on Friday and we will see what will 
happen. In reply to a question, Feissel said that the 
discussions on various ideas have just begun and that it is too 
early to say anything on the issue. He said that the issue is 
not one of a differences of views and that the process of 
negotiations is continuing. The UN delegation is currently 
holding a meeting with the Greek Cypriot delegation headed by 
Kliridhis.

  [Text] President Rauf Denktas has charged that the Greek 
Cypriots are continuing to implement their Akritas plan. This 
was obvious during the last meeting of the Greek generals, he 
said. 
  The Council of Ministers convened under President Rauf 
Denktas this morning and assessed the developments concerning 
the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. In a statement before 
the meeting, Denktas said he was meeting with the Council of 
Ministers in order to lay the ground for his meeting this 
afternoon with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's 
deputy special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas pointed out that the 
measures will also be assessed by the Turkish Cypriot Republican 
Assembly. He noted that the stage of discussing the measures 
has now been reached. 
  The president pointed out that at their last meeting, the 
Greek generals clearly showed what they really think about 
Cyprus. Their aim is to continue to implement the Akritas plan, 
he said, adding that the issue must be assessed seriously. This 
is an outright threat, he stressed, and the United Nations will 
be informed of the situation by letter. Denktas pointed out 
that the behavior of the Greeks runs counter to the contacts 
being held by the two sides. If this is the policy of the Greek 
Cypriot Administration, he said, then the CBM's have no meaning. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that they 
reviewed the benefits cited in the CBM's, as well as the 
benefits promised before the measures. We tried to determine 
the shortcomings and to work on getting whatever is being 
promised, he said, adding: We expected to see the promises 
become concrete; instead, we realized that many benefits were 
withdrawn. Replying to a question, Denktas said that even 
though the principle of secrecy is still valid, he would like to 
give an example. Experts said there would be gates and customs 
on both sides of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, he said, but now 
this clause has been removed. We insist on this clause. 
  Asked if the Turkish Cypriot side will go to New York at the 
end of the month, Denktas said that this can only happen if the 
UN secretary general invites him. 
  Prime Minister Hakki Atun said that a beneficial assessment 
was conducted at the meeting and that they discussed the start 
and the current stage of the negotiations. He said: We briefed 
the Council of Ministers on the views of the coalition parties 
regarding the measures. He stressed that they worked in harmony 
with the president. 
  Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said 
that the issue was assessed by the coalition parties separately 
during the Bayram holiday. The Council of Ministers 
consolidated the views of the two parties, he said, and 
President Denktas will meet with Gustave Feissel in light of 
this information. 
  The Council of Ministers session continued under Atun after 
Denktas left the meeting.

  [Text] Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas made 
the following statement today: 
  Based on existing practice and on relevant Turkish requests, 
the government has taken all the necessary measures aimed at 
offering not ordinary, but increased protection for the Turkish 
Embassy and consular staff in our country. The Turkish side has 
expressed its satisfaction with this. 
  But you cannot say the same thing about the protection the 
Turkish side is offering our staff who serve in Turkey, because 
recently, unidentified people have not only harassed and 
threatened these staff, in word and deed, but they have even 
targeted their family members. The Turkish side's attention is 
drawn to the repercussions that similar actions might have, for 
which Ankara would be responsible. 
  It is demanded that every measure be adopted to end the 
harassment and protect our official staff and their families in 
Turkey. 
  All of the above was stressed in relevant representations 
made to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and to the Turkish Embassy 
here, the Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement concludes.

which provides financing for the economic restructuring of 
Central and East European countries. FYROM's participation in 
the program was announced by the EU Commission's legal 
department, but as Venizelos explained, the extension of the 
program to countries of the former Yugoslavia is decided by the 
EU Council of Ministers where agreement is necessary. FYROM 
participation in the program requires a special regulation as 
happened in the case of Croatia.

  [Excerpt] The tragic shipping accident in the Bosporus 
Straits has created a bad precedent in Turkey's announced 
intention to seek amendments to the 1936 Treaty of Montreux 
governing the international status of the straits with 
international marine regulations. 
  In 1992, Ankara began a process to amend the Treaty and 
recently moved to adopt a new rule for the straits that provides 
for a 24 hour advance notice of the passage of ships with 
dangerous and polluting cargo. 
  In connection with the amendment of the Treaty, Turkey 
recalls the dangers to the sea from the passage of big tankers, 
which mainly come through the Black Sea. The tragic accident in 
the Bosporus and the threat of a major ecological disaster to 
the area could be a first class pretext for Turkey to insist on 
the amendment of the Treaty of Montreux. 
  Ankara's main goal is to control the sea route for 
transporting oil, a move that will primarily hurt Russia, but 
also all other countries with commercial interests in the Black 
Sea. It will also hurt Greece, which, above all else, is a 
cosignatory of the Treaty. 
  Alexandros Alavanos, a Coalition of the Left and Progress 
European Parliament deputy, has already asked the European Union 
Council of Ministers to deal with an attempt by Turkey to 
violate the Treaty and asked that the issue be discussed at the 
Pan European Transport Conference in Crete. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
said that the objective of his visit to Cyprus, which will begin 
tomorrow, is to promote the coordination of defense plans 
between Greece and Cyprus. In a statement, Arsenis also said 
that the coordination is necessary because the two countries 
face a common danger. The Greek national defense minister noted 
that a prerequisite for the coordination of defense plans is the 
coordination of armaments programs. That is why, during his 
visit, he will be accompanied by the president and other 
officials of the greek arms industry. Asked why a common 
defense goal had not been promoted in the past, Arsenis said 
that perhaps in the past there was too much optimism about the 
initiatives for a diplomatic solution. In order to promote a 
diplomatic, political, and viable solution, Arsenis stressed 
that we should have high credibility in the area of defense.

  [Editorial Report] Given the "notoriously tense" relations 
between Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and 
alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos, the 
13 February Athens daily I KATHIMERINI questions whether the 
latter will remain in place after Greece's term as European 
Union president ends. The newspaper cites diplomats "in the 
know" as saying that Pangalos will probably move to another 
ministry. Meanwhile, other sources maintain that the alternate 
minister will definitely not seek an appointment as European 
Union commissioner, as was rumored late last year. According to 
the newspaper, this means that the list of possible successors 
to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou would grow by yet another 
strong candidate.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kinali: "No Bargaining Talks"] </F>
  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel, who remained in Istanbul 
during the religious festival, has responded to Workers Party of 
Kurdistan [PKK] leader Abdullah Ocalan's latest call for a 
conditional cease-fire agreement by saying that "the PKK is a 
criminal organization. The government will not address it as a 
party to negotiations." Regarding Ocalan's statement that he is 
prepared to discuss all the alternatives, including the 
possibility of the establishment of a federation, Demirel said: 
"That is a nonsensical statement." 
  On the occasion of the religious festival Demirel received 
citizens in his house in the Etiler quarter of Istanbul at 1500. 
He later met with a group of journalists. Stressing that the 
PKK is a criminal organization that has killed 1,800 citizens, 
including several members of the security forces, he said: 
<H5>  They Must Surrender </H5>
  PKK members have taken up positions on the heights in Igdir, 
Ardahan, and Kars provinces. They have turned the caves into 
arms depots. The state will continue to struggle. It must 
render that organization ineffective; no other alternative 
exists. Ocalan may have said this or that, but the state will 
not listen to him. We have called on the PKK members to agree 
to surrender, and I wish to reiterate that call. They must 
surrender to the state's judicial organs. They must come down 
from the mountains. No one must try to test the capabilities of 
the republic. I wish to inform everyone both inside and outside 
Turkey that the government will safeguard Turkey's unity and 
territorial integrity. 
<H5>  I Congratulate the Security Forces </H5>
  The culprits responsible for the massacre at the railway 
station in Tuzla have been arrested. I congratulate the 
security forces. Their search uncovered the culprits whose 
action cut five young people to pieces. Their arrest makes us 
happy during this religious festival. 
<H5>  Europe's Squint-Eyed Approach </H5>
  The European Parliament's decision [on the lifting of the 
immunity of Democracy Party deputies] is biased. It indicates 
that the European Parliament looks at the matter with 
half-closed eyes; they look at it from the wrong angle. I 
believe that it is shameful for them to applaud the developments 
in Turkey while they deem it inappropriate to even mention the 
word Corsica to France [sentence as published]. 
<H5>  Foreign Currency Will Not Be in Short Supply </H5>
  The question of terrorism is the only problem in Turkey. We 
can find everything we need in the markets. Do we have lines of 
people waiting for gasoline, pharmaceuticals, and powdered 
sugar? No, we do not. Will foreign currency be in short supply 
in Turkey? No, it will not. People can go out into the streets 
in large cities like Ankara, Istanbul, Erzurum, and Trabzon at 
any time of the night, which is not the case in Europe. I am a 
standard bearer of democracy. I will be the first to oppose any 
action that conflicts with democracy. 
  Demirel was in a happy mood. You could tell at first glance 
that he had had his hair cut on the occasion of the religious 
festival. His house was full of people making holiday visits. 
The first to arrive was Gokberk Ergenekon, the True Path Party 
deputy from Antalya, and Erman Yerdelen, chairman of the Turkish 
airline's executive committee. Meanwhile, Aga Ceylan, who is 
known for his close relations with former President Turgut Ozal, 
sent a bouquet of flowers to Demirel.

  [Text] New York, Mar. 17 (A.A.) -- Turkish Ambassador to 
the United Nations Inal Batu said Wednesday [16 March] that 
Turkey has always worked with discipline and faith in any UN 
mission it took part in. 
  Batu quelled fears that Turkish involvement in the Balkans, 
which was Ottoman domain for 500 years, would be a contribution 
toward peace and not conquest [as received]. 
  A meeting is expected to be held in New York between U.N. 
Peace Forces Operations (UNPROFOR) Commander Kofi Hannan [name 
as received] and Batu. 
  Batu is expected to reiterate Turkey's readiness to 
contribute with a mechanized battalion of 1,000 troops, which 
could be deployed within a week. 
  Batu also said that Ankara favors a solution which would 
allow the deployment of Turkish forces in the already secured 
regions in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe arrived on an 
official visit in Turkey this evening. He was received at 
Ankara's Esenboga Airport by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  In a statement at the airport, Cetin noted that the 
friendship between Turkey and France is historical and is 
becoming increasingly stronger. Pointing out that the visit 
will give a new impetus to Turkish-French relations, Cetin said 
that the talks will focus on measures to be adopted for the 
further development of bilateral relations in the political, 
economic, and defense industry fields. Cetin concluded by saying 
that the work that must be done in order not to lose the current 
momentum in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is nearing a solution, 
will also be discussed with the visiting minister. 
  In his statement, Juppe declared that Turkey is an important 
country, which is gaining weight and strength throughout the 
world. The free trade union to be effected between Turkey and 
the 12 European countries in 1995 demonstrates its economic 
importance. Juppe said that France attaches great importance to 
Turkey because it shares the same values with France especially 
with regard to democracy, human rights, and the supremacy of 
law. Pointing out that Turkey constitutes a factor of stability 
in the region, the French minister remarked that a solution is 
imminent concerning the problem in former Yugoslavia. In reply 
to a question, Juppe explained that France is loyal to Turkey's 
unity and integrity and opposes all acts of terrorism, 
regardless of their origin. 
  Cetin hosted a dinner in honor of the visiting foreign 
minister tonight.

  [Text] French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who arrived in 
Ankara on an official visit yesterday, began to hold meetings 
today. 
  Prime Minister Tansu Ciller received the visiting minister 
at 
the prime ministerial residence and conferred with him for some 
time. Ambassador Volkan Vural, the chief aide to the prime 
minister, was also present at the meeting. 
  In a statement after the meeting, Alain Juppe said that they 
affirmed the importance the two countries attach to the 
development of bilateral relations. He pointed out that in 
recent years France became the country investing most in Turkey. 
He added that intensive cooperation is taking place in the 
cultural field, and that the Galatasaray University and the 
second French high school to be opened in Ankara are examples of 
this cooperation. 
  Juppe stressed that France is very determined to support 
Turkey's integration in Europe. 
  In a statement after the meeting, chief prime ministerial 
aide Vural said that the French foreign minister delivered a 
verbal message from Prime Minister Balladur to Prime Minister 
Ciller. Vural said that Juppe raised the issue of Turkey's 
membership in the European Union and expressed France's support 
for Turkey regarding this issue. Juppe also said that France 
will help strengthen Turkey's membership in the European Union. 
The French foreign minister pointed out that Turkey made 
important moves toward a peaceful solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Vural then said that at the meeting Prime Minister Ciller 
raised the issue of the DEP [Democracy Party] deputies who were 
stripped of their immunity. Vural said: Prime Minister Ciller 
said that she observed that the issue is giving rise to concern 
in France due to misunderstanding and lack of information. The 
prime minister stressed that legislative immunity in Turkey is 
more comprehensive than in many European countries, and that 
those who were stripped of their immunity continue to be members 
of parliament. She noted that they were stripped of their 
immunity because of serious allegations that they had links with 
a terrorist organization. She added that this must be 
investigated by the judicial authorities, and that parliament 
only opened the way for the judiciary. The prime minister 
stressed that the decision will be made by independent courts. 
  The French foreign minister said that France respects 
Turkey's territorial integrity, and realizes that Turkey is 
faced with terrorism. He stated that his country took measures 
against the terrorist organization PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] and that France is opposed to terrorism. He stressed 
that his government does not have a view regarding the lifting 
of immunity, adding that his country would not interfere in 
Turkey's domestic affairs. 
  Official talks were held between the delegations of the 
Turkish and French ministries. The Turkish delegation at the 
talks was headed by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and the French 
delegation by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. 
  In a statement before the talks, Cetin said that he held a 
very beneficial meeting with the visiting minister this morning, 
and that he briefed him in detail about the developments in 
Turkey. Cetin said that Turkey fights terrorism within the 
framework of human rights and the law. He added that he thanked 
Juppe for the decision made by France regarding terrorism. 
  Juppe was later received by President Suleyman Demirel at 
the 
Cankaya Mansion. Foreign Minister Cetin was also present. 
  Juppe will go to Istanbul this afternoon, and leave Turkey 
tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that 
the next few months will constitute a turning point in the 
struggle against terrorism and for the unity and integrity of 
the country. These issues will soon cease to occupy the top of 
the country's agenda, she said. Ciller noted that this will 
allow for increased efforts to improve the economy, which has 
been drained by the struggle against terrorism. 
  In a news conference in Ankara today, Ciller recalled that 
terrorism was at the top of the country's agenda when the 
government assumed power seven to eight months ago. Citing 
examples of newspaper headlines on terrorist incidents published 
at the time, Ciller explained that the state is now able to 
significantly counter terrorism. The prime minister said that 
during this period, the government attacked the terrorist PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's financial resources 
and, to a large extent, put a stop to the organization's 
narcotics smuggling activities. Some of the specially trained 
antiterror teams have also been sent to the region, she added. 
Recalling that the banning of the PKK in many countries also 
occurred in this period, Ciller announced: The next few months 
will constitute a turning point in the struggle against the PKK 
and in protecting the unity and integrity of the country. These 
issues will drop to the bottom of the agenda, she said. [passage 
omitted] 
  Commenting on economic issues, the prime minister stated 
that 
when the government came to power, the growth rate was zero, the 
inflation rate was 78 percent, the struggle against terrorism 
drained 26 trillion Turkish lira, and the policy of subsidies no 
longer served its original goals. Around the same time, Ciller 
explained, the state economic enterprises, which employ 700,000 
workers, showed a loss of 70-90 trillion Turkish lira; the 
deficit of SST [Social Security Organization] was 24 trillion 
Turkish lira and that of Bag-Kurt [Social Security Association 
for Tradesmen, Artisans, and Independent Workers] was 6 trillion 
Turkish lira; and the foreign currency rate adjustments were 
kept below the rate of inflation. Ciller said that this 
discrepancy in the currency adjustments and the debts accrued in 
the past caused a public deficit of 217 trillion Turkish lira, 
which must be paid by the people in the form of taxes. 
  Pointing out that the government assumed its duty with a 
determination to break this vicious circle in the economy, 
Ciller remarked that a certain distance has been covered in this 
field as well. For the first time, the Treasury did not have to 
borrow any money in January and February this year because the 
state obtained new resources close to $5.5 million, thus 
allowing existing debts to be stretched over longer terms.

  [Text] Ankara -- It is being reported that Jalal Talabani, 
leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], went to 
Damascus last week to take part in the 40th day memorial 
services for Hafiz al-Asad's late son Basil al-Asad. It is 
being reported that Talabani, who reportedly returned to 
southern [Iraqi] Kurdistan yesterday, held a meeting with PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Ocalan before his return. 
  It is being said that the foreign ministries of Turkey, 
United States, and Britain were aware of Talabani's visit. 
  Sources close to Poised Hammer who are carefully following 
Talabani's visit claimed that Ocalan is planning to announce a 
cease-fire in the next six to nine months.

<F P=106> [Report by Dogan Duyar] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that Jalal Talabani, leader of 
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], and General Aydin Ilter, 
commander of the Gendarmerie Forces, have met secretly in 
Silopi. The meeting drew attention because it came in the wake 
of "the meeting on election security" held in Batman to discuss 
local elections in the southeast. 
  The PUK leader had met PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
leader Abdullah Ocalan during his recent visit to Damascus. 
  The Talabani-Ilter meeting, which was confirmed by PUK 
officials in Ankara, took place a week ago. The meeting was 
preceded by a "summit on election security" held in Batman on 4 
March with the participation of Interior Minister Nahit Mentese; 
Unal Erkan, governor of the state of emergency region; Mehmet 
Agar, general director of the Security; MIT [National 
Intelligence Organization] undersecretary Sonmez Koksal,; Aydin 
Ilter, commander of the Gendarmerie Forces; and many provincial 
governors and heads of security departments. The summit made a 
number of decisions in connection with the local elections. 
  PUK leader Talabani held a meeting with PKK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan during his visit to Damascus last week made to express 
condolences on the death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son. 
  It is not known what issues were discussed during the 
meeting 
in Silopi. One view is that on the eve of the local elections, 
Turkey conveyed its requests to the northern Iraqi leaders on 
various issues, primarily regarding border security. Another 
view is that "Talabani is continuing to act as a mediator 
between Apo [Abdullah Ocalan] and the Turkish Government. 
Talabani briefed the soldiers about his impressions of his 
Damascus visit." 
  There are reports that the PUK leader, who is at present is 
in northern Iraq, will leave for France in the next few days. 
<H5>  Dizai: I Do Not Know What Was Discussed </H5>
  After reminding PUK's Ankara representative Sefin Dizai 
about 
the Batman summit on security during the elections, we asked if 
the Turkish government had made any requests regarding the local 
elections. Dizai replied: "No. The elections are Turkey's 
internal problem. I hope that the people in the region will be 
calm during the elections and that there will be no violence; I 
advise them to do so." 
  Upon being reminded of the PKK's decision to boycott the 
elections and the Turkish government's uneasiness over the 
situation in northern Iraq and the PKK presence there, Dizai 
said: " We have a responsibility to defend the security of the 
borders and the region. Our fulfilling this responsibility will 
not depend on the PKK or any other organization. This issue is 
completely separate from the elections." 
  Asked if Talabani was representing the northern Iraqi 
administration at the meeting with Ilter, Dizai said: " No. I 
think Talabani represented his own party. I have no information 
on the subjects discussed during the meeting, but border 
security might have been discussed."

  [Excerpts] Yaman Toruner, the director of the Central Bank, 
has said there are deposits in every kind of foreign currency in 
the banks in Turkey. He also said that the parity of the U.S. 
dollar will be established in accordance with supply and demand 
in the money markets. Stressing that the Central Bank must not 
be weakened, Toruner asserted: "The Central Bank is one of 
Turkey's most unique establishments. It must not be weakened, 
even for the sake of elections." [passage omitted] 
  Toruner described as unfounded rumors that bank deposits in 
foreign currency will be placed under control and revealed the 
amount of foreign currency reserves in the Central Bank. He 
said foreign currency reserves total around $4.640 billion. He 
also said that $3.549 billion of that amount can be used "in 15 
minutes." Toruner noted that accounts in the Dersdner Bank are 
not included in the amount. 
  Toruner asserted: "Any other figure that may be mentioned 
will be wrong. The amount of foreign currency the banks hold is 
enough to meet 80 percent of their commitments. They have moved 
to increase the amount to 100 percent. The banks have the 
equivalent to every deposit account in foreign currency."

  [Excerpts] Brussels, March 16 (AFP) -- The European Union 
[EU] bowed to pressure from France Wednesday [16 March] by 
extending a system of minimum prices for imports of seven 
species of fish by two months. 
  EU sources said the move, which reversed an EU statement the 
previous day, was part of a deal under which Paris will drop its 
opposition to the admission of Norway to the European Union. 
  The European Commission confirmed that the prices, due to 
expire March 15, will be extended until May 17. It did not 
specify there had been pressure from the French Government. 
  Earlier in Paris, the French Agriculture and Fisheries 
Ministry said the decision was taken overnight after strong 
lobbying by France. 
  "The French Government intervened vigorously to demand that 
the Commission review its decision to suspend the system of 
minimum import prices," said the statement, citing Agriculture 
and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech. 
  The prices were decided on February 4 and are aimed at 
protecting EU fishermen against excessively cheap imports. 
Minimum import prices were set for fish last year as well, from 
February to December. [passage omitted] 
  Sources said that in return for the extension France had 
agreed to conditions on Norway's admission to the European 
Union, although no details were immediately available. [passage 
omitted] 
  Initial reactions to the extension among French fishermen 
were not positive. In Concarneau, Britanny, fishermen called 
the deal "a half measure, which will have no effect long term, 
and which does not solve the problem." 
  Union leader Yves L'Helgouac'h said: "If this measure has 
been thrashed out at the expense of giving Norway membership of 
the European Union, it is a dupes' market." Norway's admission 
"is not a good deal for our fishing industry, which risks being 
swamped even further by Norwegian fish," he added.

  [Text] Dutch Foreign Minister Kooijmans came to Stockholm 
today directly from Brussels. He anticipated a dramatic 
development if the European Union [EU] foreign ministers do not 
solve their problems on Tuesday [22 March]. 
  [Begin Kooijmans recording, in English, followed by Swedish 
translation] I know that the word crisis is used very often, 
sometimes too early, but I would find that a very dramatic 
development, which would stall also other forms of cooperation 
within the European Union. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] This was said by the Dutch foreign minister, 
Peter Kooijmans, who this afternoon arrived in Stockholm almost 
directly from the dramatic night in Brussels. He said that it 
is not a crisis yet, but if the Twelve have not solved their 
institutional questions by next Tuesday, it will become almost 
impossible for the EU Parliament to discuss the EU's enlargement 
before the elections in June, in order that the timetable of 1 
January can be adhered to in the case of the four countries 
which have their membership agreements ready. This would be a 
very dramatic development, the Dutch foreign minister said. 
  Kooijmans was very critical of those countries which are now 
putting the brakes on over the question of the blocking 
majority, as he said. He does not see any logic in that; the 
way the others want to deal with the matter is the same way that 
has been applied in all other cases when the EU has received new 
members. In addition, the EU Parliament would never accept the 
views of Great Britain and Spain, he said. He therefore sees no 
need to show flexibility toward the two countries. He also said 
that if their governments have problems with their parliaments 
at home, like the British Government has, why not say to the 
critics that this problem has already been solved, it was solved 
at the EU summit in Lisbon when the procedure concerning the new 
members was taken up. 
  So, one can judge from the statements of Dutch Foreign 
Minister Kooijmans that there is no room for compromise, and 
during the night he did not see any such signs from the British 
side either.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Course Set for EU Entry"] </F>
  [Excerpt] In the view of the federal government, foreign 
and security policy and economic reasons speak for Austria's 
accession to the European Union [EU]. This was emphasized by 
the federal government in its report on the result of the EU 
negotiations, which was adopted by the Cabinet and passed on to 
parliament on Wednesday [16 March]. 
  With a special Cabinet meeting in parliament, the federal 
government has set the course for a referendum on Austrian EU 
membership. Federal Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock presented the results of the Brussels 
negotiations to the Cabinet in the form of a report. Moreover, 
agreement was reached in the coalition on the text of the short 
constitutional amendment on accession, which will form the basis 
of the referendum to be held after the relevant resolution is 
adopted by parliament. As a result of the extra Cabinet 
meeting, these bills could be tabled in yesterday's 
parliamentary session, and can, thus, be passed on to the 
responsible committees. 
  The government report notes that "European integration is 
and 
always has primarily been a basis for security policy." This 
has proved its worth over more than 40 years. Now "Austria also 
has the chance to join this area of stability and peace and to 
participate in its shaping." 
  Since the end of the Cold War, the European Community, apart 
from its traditional economic leadership, has assumed a key role 
for securing stability in all of Europe. The necessity for 
efficient foreign and security policy at the level of the Union 
is becoming more and more obvious. 
  The following is a quote from the introductory paragraph of 
the government report: "However, the crisis-like developments 
of the recent period, particularly the nationalist conflicts in 
East and southeast Europe, and the problems resulting from the 
change of system in the new democracies also indicate the 
difficulties regarding the development of a stable European 
peace system and the enormous dangers for Europe that would 
result from a failure of these efforts. As a result of its 
location at the fringe of the European `area of turbulence,' 
Austria has a vital interest that the EU effectively meets its 
responsibility for the stability of all of Europe. Membership 
in the EU would offer Austria the opportunity to voice its 
specific concerns in the Union's joint policymaking, and, on the 
basis of equality, to have a say in those decisions that will 
determine Europe's, and thus also Austria's, future." 
  The federal government emphasizes that only full integration 
of Austria into the process of European integration can ensure 
"Austria's comprehensive participation in the economic 
developments of Europe." The effects of European recession, 
which have also been felt in Austria, show "the limited 
possibilities a medium-sized European country has if its wants 
to fight economic crisis phenomena by itself." Just as economic 
setbacks, structural disadvantages of competition, and mass 
unemployment are European phenomena in an era of 
interdependency, "the countermeasures" must also "be coordinated 
at this level." 
  In 29 chapters spread over some 80 pages, the government 
report offers a detailed representation of the results achieved 
by Austria in the negotiations in Brussels. 
  The draft amendment on accession comprises 16 pages. It is 
based on the assumption that the membership agreement must be 
seen as an amendment to the federal Constitution. The amendment 
should "expressly authorize the conclusion of this treaty, which 
is why it has to be subject to a referendum under Article 44, 
Section 3 of the federal Constitutional after it was adopted by 
parliament." 
  The joint Cabinet statement by the federal chancellor and 
the 
foreign minister points out that, "with the exception of 
Chapters 23 (economic and monetary policy) and 28 
(institutions), the EU negotiations have been concluded. These 
two areas, which primarily deal with overcoming antagonisms 
within the EU, should be concluded in the very near future. For 
technical reasons, the editing work for the conclusion of the 
membership agreement will take some more time." 
  It was expressly stated that the comprehensive report on the 
membership negotiations was released early, on the one hand to 
provide detailed information quickly and, on the other, to give 
parliament the opportunity for detailed discussions against the 
background of the result achieved in the negotiations. 
  Without yesterday's Cabinet meeting, legislation could not 
have been introduced in parliament before 6 April. As far as 
the referendum is concerned there are still two possible days -- 
12 or 19 June. After the Cabinet meeting, Chancellor Franz 
Vranitzky said that the day would be determined depending on the 
preparatory work and the decision by the European Parliament. 
As an additional document, the Austrian parliament will also 
receive the report of the European Council of Ministers to the 
European Parliament. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed "chs": "13,000 Unemployed Less Than a Year </F>
Ago"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- According to Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, 
the Austrian economy is moving upward again. A sign of an 
"economic revival" is a "reversal of the trend" in the labor 
market. At the moment 13,000 more persons are employed than in 
mid-March 1993. 
  As Vranitzky said yesterday at a press conference after the 
Cabinet meeting, unemployment went down by 25,000 persons over 
the past two weeks. For men, who had been particularly affected 
by job cuts in industry, unemployment is 8.5 percent below the 
value of March 1993, Vranitzky said. A total of 32,000 
foreigners currently are unemployed, compared with 38,000 at the 
end of February. Vranitzky stated that the more favorable 
development is due to the fact that construction work began 
earlier this year. He expects the latest development to have a 
positive effect on the referendum for membership in the European 
Union.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gradual Recovery of Economy"] </F>
  [Text] According to the recent medium-term forecast of the 
Economic Research Institute, the Wifo, the Austrian economy has 
emerged from the recession and stands at the beginning of a 
period of -- initially restrained -- recovery. 
  In the 1993-1998 period, the gross domestic product will 
increase by an average 2.3 percent per year, the same rate as in 
the mid-eighties and thereafter, the Wifo noted. Thus, the 
Austrian economy would grow faster than the German (average 1.9 
percent) and about as fast as that of the European members of 
the OECD (2.2 percent). 
  On the labor market the forced increase in labor 
productivity 
compared to previous years will hold down employment growth to 
0.6 percent per year. Since the work force is expected to grow 
by some 0.7 percent, the Wifo expects an increase in the 
unemployment rate to 7.4 percent in the next few years from the 
current 5.8 percent. 
  In the Wifo's view, restructuring and streamlining by 
business will be successful. The increase in exports will 
initially only be moderate as a result of the weak German 
economy and speed up only in the course of the years. Exports 
should benefit from the quick growth in East Europe. The Wifo 
expects an average export growth of 5.75 percent in the 1993-98 
period compared to 3.5 percent for 1988-93. Foreign exchange 
revenues in real terms from the tourist trade will barely grow 
half as quickly as in the past five years. 
  The Wifo does not anticipate any inflationary impulses for 
the period up to 1998. The inflation rate is expected to 
decrease to 2.5 percent until 1995, while after that it could 
slightly increase to 3 percent. The increase in real pay of 
wage or salary earners is expected to remain an average 0.5 
percent below the increase in productivity. 
  According to the Wifo, equipment investment will not 
increase 
significantly until the end of 1995. All in all, gross fixed 
investments will increase by 3.5 percent in the 1993-98 period, 
and thus as fast as in the five preceding years.

<F P=106> ["ub" report: "Critical Questions About Germany's Role in </F>
the European Union"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- In Paris the struggle over the expansion of 
the European Union [EU] toward the north is accompanied by 
critical questions about Germany's future role in Europe. When 
Bonn speaks of an end to the "imbalance toward the south" and 
understands itself as a "hinge" in the center, this needs some 
urgent explanation, circles of French diplomacy have said. At 
the movement there is no real dialogue between Bonn and Paris. 
If this does not change, the specters of the past that one is 
encountering again everywhere cannot be banished. The 
reemergence of distrust is, however, not so much a problem 
between Paris and Bonn as between the Germans and the smaller 
states in Europe, it was noted. 
  French diplomats in Bonn accuse the Germans of having forced 
the EU expansion in Brussels by brute force. In particular, 
there are complaints that Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
occasionally uses the wrong kind of language. Kinkel threatened 
the Spanish in Brussels that he would "break their backs" if 
they did not agree to a compromise with Norway. No German would 
have talked like that before reunification. This rude language 
led to a temporary hardening of the Spanish attitude in 
Brussels, it was said. 
  In the Foreign Ministry it was stressed that none of the 
German diplomats heard Kinkel say anything like that at the 
conference table. If he did say it in a different context, a 
misunderstanding is conceivable. When the minister speaks in 
his Swabian dialect in the heat of discussion, this might sound 
different in translation than what was meant. France may be 
expressing concern that Germany wants to give up its previous 
restraint. 
  The new role in which Germany sees itself is irritating, 
above all, the smaller states in the EU and not so much Paris, 
the French side said. Minor differences because of Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl's nonattendance at the memorial celebrations on the 
50th anniversary of the Allied invasion in Normandy on 6 June 
and because of the festivities for the withdrawal of the troops 
of the Western Allies from Berlin on 8 September must be seen 
against the background of this general distrust in Europe. 
  For the first time French diplomatic circles stated that one 
is wondering what the shifting of the capital from Bonn to 
Berlin will mean. German politics must explain this to France 
above all. It still holds true that Europe cannot be shaped 
without renewed cooperation between France and Germany. Bonn and 
Paris together must form the "hinge" between the north and the 
south. France must know whether the Germans want to maintain 
the old ties with the West from before reunification or whether 
one has to prepare for a Germany that is oriented differently. 
German-French friendship is not self-evident, it was stressed. 
Friendship is not a natural condition between the two 
countries. It must be consolidated again and again. It is high 
time for Bonn and Paris to talk to each other honestly and to 
frankly broach the many problems that exist between them. 
  A change in government in Bonn will not irritate Paris, it 
was said. In personal talks Social Democratic Party Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping promised complete continuity in foreign and 
security policy. He stated that what he said in his speech at 
the Munich security conference will apply to his chancellorship, 
it was noted.

  [Text] The Spanish foreign and agriculture ministers, 
Javier Solana and Vicente Albero, respectively, are well pleased 
by the agreement on fishing reached with Norway. This is one of 
the issues that was blocking the EU [European Union] enlargement 
negotiations. 
  Speaking in Brussels, Javier Solana described the agreement 
as reasonable although he admitted that it is not all that Spain 
had asked for. The Spanish foreign minister highlighted that 
the quotas are not the main point this agreement. The end of 
the transitory regime in 1996 instead of in the year 2003 is 
more important [Spain will be able to fish in all EU waters in 
1996 instead of waiting until 2003]. 
  For his part, Vicente Albero told this radio station that 
Spanish companies can establish joint ventures in Norway and 
thus fish on the Norwegian quota. 
  He added that Spanish fishermen will have access to the 
Norwegian fishing grounds and that the fishing quota has finally 
been increased. 
  On another hand, next Tuesday [22 March], the EU will have 
to 
solve the institutional dispute about the voting system in the 
Council of Ministers. According to the Greek presidency, this 
will be the last chance if blocking the EU enlargement is to be 
avoided. 
  Despite a long meeting, the Community foreign ministers were 
unable to reach an agreement on how many votes will be needed in 
a 16-member Council of Ministers to block a decision. 
  Spain and the United Kingdom want, for very different 
reasons, the blocking minority to stay at 23 votes while the 
rest of the countries favor increasing it to 27 votes when the 
four new members join.

  [Excerpts] The Swiss Justice Ministry has confirmed that it 
will not be helping the United States in its inquiries on 
suspected American spy Aldrich Ames. The Ministry rejected a 
request from the United States for judicial cooperation, but it 
did block three Swiss bank accounts held by Ames. This decision 
raised certain hopes in Washington which, as it turned out, were 
largely unfounded. A report from SRI's [Swiss Radio 
International] Michel Walter, voiced by Peter Capella: 
  [Passage omitted] Washington approached Switzerland in the 
course of its investigations because a part of the suspected 
$2.5 million in pay-offs to Ames was deposited by Moscow in 
Swiss bank accounts. The United States is applauding the 
freezing of the accounts in question, as well as the release of 
transaction details and confiscation of the deposited sums. 
However, Switzerland reiterated that its judicial cooperation 
treaty with the United States excludes all political matters, 
and notably espionage. 
  Nonetheless, Switzerland did freeze the relevant accounts 
and 
at the time it appeared that Switzerland would help the 
Americans out after all. Some newspapers wondered whether the 
authorities were even prepared to give this judicial help 
because Ames used Switzerland for illicit money-laundering. But 
the Swiss Justice Ministry maintains this was simply wild 
speculation. It said the move to block Ames' bank account was 
initiated purely within the context of a Swiss inquiry, which 
wanted to establish whether or not Ames's activities had 
violated Switzerland's penal code on espionage. The Ministry 
says that issue is, however, quite separate from the American 
request for judicial cooperation, which was turned down less 
than two weeks ago.

  [Text] Copenhagen, March 16 (AFP) -- Danish Prime Minister 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen on Wednesday [16 March] blasted Britain's 
insistence on maintaining current minority blocking rights 
within a future European Union (EU) expanded to 16 members. 
  He said in a communique that he regretted that "a technical 
issue, the size of the blocking minority, destroys our joy at 
seeing Norway join the other countries (Austria, Finland and 
Sweden) that have signed agreements on procedures for their 
admission to the EU." 
  Britain, with some backing from Spain, demands that the 
entry 
of those four countries should not dilute the ability of bigger 
EU members to block decisions they do not like. 
  Currently, 23 out of 76 votes divided up among the present 
12 
members are enough to block majority-approved decisions. Most 
members want to maintain this 30 percent level, but Britain and 
Spain think this would go against their interests, since those 
two countries could no longer combine with one smaller member to 
constitute a blocking minority. Other members favor a shift to 
27 out of 90 votes. 
  The Danish prime minister said that Denmark could not agree 
with the British stand "because a successful conclusion to 
enlargement (of the community) is an absolute condition for 
letting the European Union meet the next and decisive challenge: 
integration of the new democracies in Central and East Europe. 
  "The future of Europe is at stake here, neither more nor 
less. We expect the British Government to recognize the fact 
that the next meeting of (EU) foreign ministers, in Brussels on 
March 22, is really becoming a last-chance meeting." 
  Earlier in the day, Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg 
Petersen called the British stand "untenable," adding that "I 
don't like to use the word `crisis,' which has been overused in 
the past, but this time the EU really finds itself in a deep 
crisis" because of the British demand. 
  Opposition leader Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, a former foreign 
minister, joined the criticism, saying that "It is 
incomprehensible that Great Britain has chosen to isolate itself 
in a corner by adopting an indefensible attitude that weakens 
the power of decision of a Europe enlarged by several members. 
  ``The British cannot at the same time be firm advocates of 
enlargement and make the EU's decision-making process even more 
difficult.''

  [Text] Aghios Nikolaos, Greece, March 16 (AFP) -- Greek 
Eurodeputies reacted coolly Wednesday [16 March] to a 
ground-breaking invitation to The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM] from the speaker of the Macedonian parliament, 
offered in a bid to ease crisis-hit bilateral relations. 
  Stoyan Andov told AFP he had passed the invitation addressed 
to all 24 of Athens's Euro-MPs to the Greek deputy chairman of 
the European Parliament, Yeoryios Anastasopoulos, on the 
sidelines of a pan-European transport conference being held in 
this Cretan town. 
  The offer comes a month after Athens imposed a controversial 
trade blockade on FYROM in an effort to force the former 
Yugoslav republic to change its flag, its name and its 
constitution, and cease what Greece views as hostile propaganda 
and territorial claims towards the hellenic state. 
  "It is a shame that we cannot speak to each other in such a 
situation, at least among parliamentarians," Andov said, adding 
that direct contacts between the neighbour countries had reached 
a dead end. 
  Anastasopoulos, however, told AFP he had indicated to Andov 
that a visit by Greek Eurodeputies to Skopje "could take place, 
but (only) in the event of a normalisation of relations between 
the two countries." 
  Anastasopoulos said the offer would be considered, but that 
he was sceptical as to the usefulness of such a meeting. 
  Andov said he had been unable to discuss the crisis with 
Greek governmental representatives, but that he had a "friendly" 
talk with Konstandinos Tsimas, a Greek Eurodeputy of the ruling 
Socialist (PASOK) [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party. 
  Tsimas said the two men had "chewed the fat," but that, 
although he would pass on Andov's invitation to his party, he 
"could not see a lot of interest" in the offer. 
  In a separate development in Bonn, FYROM President Kiro 
Gligorov said Wednesday he favoured global discussions with 
Greece, but stressed he would not bow to the pressure of the 
embargo. 
  The embargo "could have tragic consequences" for the 
stability of the region, he told journalists on a visit to 
Germany a day ahead of a meeting with Bonn's Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel. 
  He added that the bilateral standoff could only be resolved 
through "dialogue, compromise and good faith," and called on the 
European Union [EU] and the United Nations to participate in 
efforts to find a solution. 
  Since Greece began its political offensive against Macedonia 
two years ago, only two Athens-based Eurodeputies and no 
national parliamentarians at all have made the trip to FYROM. 
  One Greek Eurodeputy, leftist Mikhael Papayianakis, and 
around 600 Greek intellectuals and celebrities have criticised 
the blockade. 
  The embargo was sparked last month after the United States 
formally recognised FYROM. 
  Many Western countries have also recognised the former 
Yugoslav republic, while Greece's EU partners have fiercely 
condemned the Athens blockade.

<F P=106> [Letter from Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad, prime minister of </F>
Malaysia: "Malaysia: No Contracts for Britain If the 
Consequence Is Vilification"] 
  [Text] The reports and debates on the Malaysian ban on 
contracts for British firms expose a sad degree of ignorance or 
carelessness on the part of the British Press and British 
personalities. 
  In the first place everyone seems incapable of 
distinguishing 
between a loan and a grant. Persistently, the loan for the 
Pergau Dam is referred to as a grant. Had it been a grant, the 
amount which covered more than half the cost of the project 
would certainly have made it a wonderful buy for the Malaysians, 
contrary to what the press and some British officials insist it 
was. 
  A loan has to be repaid with interest, however small. The 
benefit for Malaysia would only be marginal. On the other hand, 
if it was not offered, the project could have gone to 
non-British companies. Japan offers soft loans on a yearly 
basis. Other countries also offer grants or loans when bidding 
for projects. 
  The Pergau loan serves to help pay a British company which 
presumably would make a profit. So the aid benefits a British 
company. Malaysia gets nothing other than a marginally lower 
price. How driving a hard bargain in order to save the Malaysian 
government's money is considered corruption is beyond us. 
  Malaysians are not concerned about British scruples over 
selling arms. Arms are arms and, whether they are gifts or 
subsidised or aided or sold at a massive profit, the purpose is 
the same. If you have scruples don't sell arms at all. In no 
other business is there so much hypocrisy in the West. When 
arms are sold, long-term payments or offset programmes or 
special terms are invariably offered by every one. 
  In any case it is clear that the loan is for the Pergau Dam. 
It has never been proven conclusively that it was for the arms 
purchase. The attempt to link it with the arms sale is 
political and intended to embarrass the British government. 
Malaysia is not concerned and did not react or comment. 
  Unhappy with the lack of results over the expose, the 
British 
press then shifted its focus to Malaysia. Of course the natives 
are corrupt. They must be, because they are not British and not 
white. To allege that the Malaysian prime minister accepted 
bribes is second nature. He should accept this allegation 
because, as a British newspaper later commented, all politicians 
in Asia are corrupt. The question is: why do the British insist 
on corrupting "corrupt" people. Don't they have any scruples or 
do they consider giving bribes is not corruption? 
  The allegations against the Malaysian prime minister have 
turned out to be baseless. Wimpey denied (them). Even the 
editor of THE SUNDAY TIMES said he was misunderstood. 
  There was no tender for an aluminium smelter. There was no 
smelter project. Only a feasibility study aided by the British 
government, which hoped to get the project for a British 
company, Wimpey. It was not feasible. 
  Alleging, wrongly, that the Malaysian prime minister is 
corrupt may be part of British press freedom. But the Malaysian 
prime minister need not subscribe to that, even as Andrew Neil 
[SUNDAY TIMES editor] himself did not accept reports on his 
affair with Pamella Bordes. 
  Press freedom is about telling the truth, not fabricating 
lies for whatever purpose. The contempt for the hurt inflicted 
on others seems to be condoned by the British government and 
people. No scruples about lying, seemingly plenty about selling 
arms? The standard answer to the Malaysians is that the British 
press is free. "Lies, damned lies" are free. Redress isn't. 
This is what Western democracy and human rights is all about. 
If this is not moral decadence, then what is? 
  Giving contracts to the British seems to expose Malaysia to 
vilification and libellous attacks. Why let British companies 
make money out of Malaysia if this is to be the consequence? If 
we are going to be vilified, at least we should not pay for it. 
Thus the decision to stop giving contracts to British firms. 
  And Britain should be happy. No contracts means no soft 
loans, no grants and no corruption of the natives. Since 
Britain was, according to British papers, responsible for 
Malaysia becoming one of the "economic tigers" of South East 
Asia, Malaysia would soon realise the folly of its ways. Then 
the free press can gloat when Idi Amin/Hitler/Mahathir comes 
crawling back with offers of contracts. 
  But instead we hear more threats and lies. Seems that paper 
gunboats still abound. What can Malaysia do? The free press is 
free for the British. It is not free for Malaysians. While 
British newspapers are freely available in Malaysia, Malaysian 
papers are not available to the British. And the British papers 
never publish Malaysian views. This is the practical result of 
Western-style press freedom. 
  For Malaysia, the die is cast. No contracts in exchange for 
British press freedom to tell lies.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Kelsey and Martin Himmelheimer: "Royal </F>
Ordnance Exported Weapons to East Germany"] 
  [Text] Britain's largest state-run arms company was at the 
centre of a network for the secret supply of arms to the Stasi, 
the East German security police, the INDEPENDENT can reveal. 
The evidence implicating Royal Ordnance in the traffic to the 
former NATO enemy is in the possession of the German 
authorities, which are prosecuting a subsidiary of the British 
company for illegal arms exports. 
  The evidence points to systematic breaches in export rules 
by 
British companies on a scale far greater than that so far 
exposed by the Scott inquiry into arms for Iraq. Harry Cohen, 
the Labour MP, has asked Lord Justice Scott to consider evidence 
implicating Royal Ordnance in these breaches but he has said it 
falls outside the remit of his investigation. Royal Ordnance 
has repeatedly denied breaching any arms export rules. 
  In August 1991, it emerged in German press reports that 
weapons manufactured by Heckler and Koch [H and K], a renowned 
German machine gun and rifle manufacturer, had been discovered 
in a Stasi office in Berlin. An investigation by German 
prosecutors has shown the weapons were exported from H and K to 
Royal Ordnance in the UK, to evade tight German rules on the 
arms trade, then reassembled and exported using false paperwork 
to East Germany. The export licences said the ships were 
heading for Columbia. In fact, they sailed across the Baltic 
Sea to Rostock. 
  Evidence for three shipments has emerged: in 1985 and 1986, 
when Royal Ordnance was a state-run company, and in 1988 when 
the company had been privatised and sold to British Aerospace. 
The 1988 shipment appears to have been aborted, and the weapons 
were not sold. 
  Inquiries by the INDEPENDENT have established that an 
intermediary of the East Germans met a representative from H and 
K's office in the UK and told him that the Columbians were 
interested in the purchase of H and K weapons. He provided an 
end-user certificate for Columbia, which prosecutors believe was 
acquired by bribing a senior official of the Columbian military. 
The British provided an export licence on the basis of this 
end-user, according to the German state prosecutor. 
  The weapons were ordered through Royal Ordnance, apparently 
on behalf of H and K's UK representative, from the H and K 
factory in Oberndorf. They were then handed to a British export 
agency. The ship, the MS Neuhausen, was managed and licensed to 
an East German company. A spokeswoman for the shipping agents, 
Deutsche Seereederei of Rostock, confirmed the ship served the 
UK, but did not comment on these specific shipments. Royal 
Ordnance and H and K have denied that they were aware the 
weapons were going to East Germany. In 1988, the false end-user 
did not satisfy the British authorities and the export was not 
allowed to go ahead. 
  It later emerged that the intermediary, identified in 
documents as Karlheinz Schulz, was contracted by the state-run 
East German firm, IMES, to arrange the shipments from the UK. 
IMES was run by a Stasi official. It was later discovered that 
Schulz worked for the East German security services as an arms 
procurement agent. 
  Documents show that H and K sold 100 MP5 machine guns -- the 
same kind used by the British SAS [Special Air Service] -- and 
100 sniper rifles to Royal Ordnance for the 1985 shipment. They 
were sold in parts and reassembled at the Royal Ordnance small 
arms plant in Enfield, which closed in 1987 when the company was 
privatised. In 1986, there was a second shipment of 100 rifles. 
These were among those found at the Stasi headquarters in 
Berlin in 1991. 
  After the discovery of the weapons, the German authorities 
began an investigation. Two years ago, an H and K spokeswoman 
denied any responsibility for exporting them to the Stasi and 
said "We have exported those weapons to a West European 
country." And that, it can now be confirmed, was Britain. 
  A senior executive from Heckler &amp; Koch is currently on 
trial 
in Rottweil, Baden-Wurttemberg, charged with illegally exporting 
weapons to the Middle East. Royal Ordnance has so far declined 
to comment on the allegations, which have caused uproar in 
Germany. 
  It has also emerged since the trial started that the same 
network was used to allegedly supply the Contras in Nicaragua, 
and the Middle East, including Iraq. The INDEPENDENT revealed 
last year that H and K weapons have been exported to Serbia 
since the UN embargo was imposed in 1991. H and K have denied 
any knowledge of the destination of these weapons.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Francois Scheer, French ambassador to 
Bonn, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday [17 
March]. As Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts affirmed, 
he will have a discussion with State Secretary Dieter Kastrup. 
  The summons, which in diplomatic jargon usually means the 
presentation of a complaint, is a very unusual event in 
connection with the ambassador of the neighboring country, with 
which relations are very close and friendly. It is obviously 
supposed to express Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's annoyance 
with Scheer's confidential comments to a small circle of 
journalists on Tuesday. 
  Scheer had regretted the lack of frequency in German-French 
consultations and cautiously implied shock about Germany's tone 
at European Union meetings, also among smaller partners. His 
statements were disseminated without citing him by name. 
  Ambassador Scheer had wanted in any case to discuss with the 
Foreign Ministry preparations for Kinkel's visit to Paris in the 
near future. On Wednesday evening, a Foreign Ministry official 
still emphatically denied that the formal summons was something 
completely unusual between friendly states.

  [Text] Paris -- The Foreign Ministry in Paris has confirmed 
that [Ambassador to Bonn Francois] Sheer had a "talk" with 
[German State Secretary Dieter] Kastrup. However, this talk was 
"planned" anyway because of the preparations of [German Foreign 
Minister] Kinkel's official visit to Paris on 24 March, Deputy 
Spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told DPA. 
  Concerning Bonn's claim that the ambassador had been 
"summoned," the spokeswoman said: "I would not describe it that 
way." She could not say, however, whether Sheer's comments to 
German journalists had led to his being invited to the Ministry 
"today and not yesterday or tomorrow." 
  She said that Sheer's comments were "informal." The 
resulting reports that there is "slight distrust" between Bonn 
and Paris "really do not" reflect "our attitude." 
  The foreign ministers of the two countries "know each other 
well, often talk on the phone, and cultivate trusting 
relations." This was shown over the past months during the 
difficult negotiations on the GATT Agreement, on Bosnia, and on 
the expansion of the European Union. 
  Relations with Germany are "essential" for France, and "the 
basis for the stability and prosperity all over Europe." It is 
important to further deepen these relations, Colonna said.

  [Excerpt] Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault today invited the 
German ambassador to Paris to attend the closing ceremony of the 
event marking the 50th anniversary of the landing of the allied 
forces in Normandy. At the same time, Girault confirmed the 
wish for Chancellor Helmut Kohl to attend the celebration in 
Caen on the evening of 6 June. He also informed State President 
Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, Girault 
stated today after a meeting with Ambassador Juergen Sudhoff. 
  The German Embassy rejected reports by the French radio, 
which claimed that Girault handed over an official invitation to 
Kohl. "The mayor visited the German ambassador today and handed 
him a personal invitation. There is no invitation for the 
chancellor," Embassy Spokesman Andreas von Mettenheim pointed 
out. 
  According to the French Ministry for War Veterans, which 
organizes the ceremonies, a "final decision" concerning 
Germany's possible participation has not yet been made. It must 
be made at the highest government level, the organization 
committee announced. The Elysee Palace and the Prime Minister's 
Office have so far not commented on the issue. 
  Referring to his "demarche of conviction," the mayor of Caen 
stressed the need to differentiate between the military events 
in Normandy and the ceremony in Caen. "One cannot imagine 
Helmut Kohl on Omaha Beach, but it would be quite natural for 
him to shake hands during the ceremony at the peace monument in 
Caen," Girault stated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Wiesbaden/Biblis -- A few hours before the 
controversial Block A at the Biblis nuclear power plant in Hesse 
was to resume operations, the renewed startup had to be 
suspended because of a new incident. The oil pressure of the 
hydraulic system of the turbines failed at 1310 [1210 GMT] 
today, plant manager Klaus Distler announced in Biblis. As a 
result, the reactor was automatically shut down. The category N 
(normal) incident was reported to the nuclear supervisory 
authority in the Environment Ministry in Hesse. It was only a 
technical failure and did not affect safety, he pointed out. 
  Distler stressed that the oil pressure normalized again 
within a short period. Once the cause of the failure is 
discovered, the reactor can operate again. 
  The Hesse Environment Ministry announced that the approval 
of 
the nuclear supervisory authority is required to resume Block A 
operations. In addition, a report by the Rhenish-Westphalian 
Electricity Plant, which is responsible for the nuclear power 
plant, has been requested. 
  Block A started operating on a trial basis at 0430 this 
morning. The precondition was approval by Hesse's Environment 
Minister Joschka Fischer (Alliance 90/Greens) and by Federal 
Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union). 
  Biblis A was shut down last December because of the annual 
revision. After a fire on 4 March, Fischer first banned a 
startup, but had to accept the decision by his Bonn counterpart, 
who favored a startup after a clarification of the cause of the 
fire.

  [Excerpt] Biblis/Wiesbaden (DPA) -- Block A of the Biblis 
nuclear power plant in Hesse is operational again. After an 
automatic emergency shutdown at noon on Wednesday [16 March], 
the restart program was continued around 2315 [2215 GMT], power 
plant manager Klaus Distler said on Thursday morning. The Hesse 
Environment Ministry also agreed with the decision. The reactor 
will probably be on line again by Friday morning, Distler said. 
  The power plant manager stated that the accident, which 
caused the latest shutdown of the nuclear reactor on Wednesday, 
was a "trifle": The short-circuit relay of a oil pump for 
controlling the turbine activated for no reason and thus caused 
the emergency shutdown. When the part was checked, no defect 
was found. The oil pump is needed only during the start-up 
phase; it is not important for the safety of the facility. 
  The Environment Ministry in Wiesbaden said that the Hesse 
nuclear supervisory body agreed to restart Block A after an 
on-site inspection in the nuclear plant and discussions with 
operators and experts during the night and into Thursday 
morning. After a faultless test run of the pump engine, which 
took several hours, and a positive assessment by the experts, 
the nuclear supervisory body was able to withdraw its order to 
stop the restart until matters were clarified, which had been 
given early Wednesday evening. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' met 
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl for an exchange of views in Bonn 
this evening. The main topics were probably the peace process 
in the Middle East and the further development of German-Syrian 
relations. The Chancellor's Office did not reveal any details. 
On Thursday [17 March], the Syrian foreign minister will hold 
talks with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free Democratic Party 
of Germany). Kinkel will host a dinner for his counterpart at 
the government's guest house in Petersberg near Bonn tomorrow

  [Text] Bonn -- The halt on the deportation of Bosnian 
refugees from Germany has been extended by six months to 30 
September. A spokesman of the Interior Ministry confirmed in 
Bonn today that the interior ministers of the laender have 
agreed on this measure. Without this decision, the ban would 
have expired by the end of this month. The spokesman declined 
to comment on the number of refugees who are currently in 
Germany.

  [Text] Tunis/Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government will 
give PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat political and economic support, 
because it considers him to be the guarantor for the 
continuation of the autonomy negotiations with Israel. This 
position of the Federal Government became known in Tunis on 
Tuesday [15 March] on the sidelines of a talk between 'Arafat 
and Juergen Moellemann, president of the German-Arab Society. 
  However, Bonn will not support the efforts of 'Arafat, who 
is 
weakened in his own camp, to get an international armed 
protection force. Bonn will only advocate sending civilian 
observers -- with the participation of the European Union -- to 
the territories occupied by Israel. 
  Bonn sees the Arab-Israeli peace process as being in a 
serious crisis and considers a longer delay likely. It doubts 
that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will take 
place on 13 April as planned. However, as soon as the autonomy 
administration has been established there, the Federal 
Government wants to open a German coordination office in Jericho. 
  According to information obtained by Bonn, Israel does not 
rule out an attack by Islamic fundamentalists in retaliation for 
the massacre in Hebron. During a meeting with Moellemann on 
Tuesday, Tunisian Foreign Minister Ben Yahya warned against 
"underestimating the explosive potential of Shi'ite 
fundamentalism, in particular in Egypt."

  [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- According to Bernd Schmidbauer, 
state minister in the Chancellor's Office and Christian 
Democratic Union member, Iran did indeed try to influence the 
Berlin Mykonos trial. Shortly before the trial opened, Iranian 
Information Minister 'Ali Fallahian asked the Federal Government 
to quash the proceedings dealing with the question of Iranian 
state-sponsored terrorism, Schmidbauer, coordinator of the 
German intelligence services in the Chancellor's Office, 
confirmed at the Mykonos trial at the Berlin Court of Appeal on 
Thursday [17 March]. Schmidbauer emphasized that he strictly 
declined to meet this wish expressed by the Iranian side, 
because the trial was exclusively a case for the independent 
German judicial authorities. 
  Shortly after his meeting with Fallahian in October 1993, 
Schmidbauer answered with a clear no to a question raised in the 
Bundestag whether the Mykonos killings were discussed in his 
meeting with Fallahian. According to the investigations of the 
Federal Public Prosecutor, Fallahian may have ordered the attack 
in which four Iranian opposition leaders were assassinated in 
the Berlin "Mykonos" restaurant on 17 September 1992.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Federal Manager Guenter 
Verheugen, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] does not 
think the result of the presidential election will decide the 
direction of later coalitions in the government. The settlement 
of Richard von Weizsaecker's succession should not be used for a 
change of power, Verheugen said before journalists in Bonn on 
Tuesday evening [15 March]. From the SPD leadership's point of 
view, a signal for the Bundestag election in October is neither 
expected nor desired from the vote of the Federal Assembly. 
  The SPD is interested in preserving "several options" for a 
government formation on the federal level. If the Free 
Democrats do not vote for Christian Democratic Union [CDU] 
candidate Roman Herzog on 23 May, this will not induce the SPD 
to refrain from talks about an alliance after an election 
victory. 
  In the election of the head of state, however, the Free 
Democrats have the opportunity to prove their independence, 
Verheugen said. If liberal political positions are decisive, it 
should not be hard for the Free Democrats to vote for SPD 
candidate Johannes Rau if they compare him with Herzog. 
  According to Verheugen, it is still open when SPD Chairman 
Rudolf Scharping will present his "shadow cabinet." This may be 
done before, after, or at the election party congress in Halle 
in June. The party chairman does not want a debate or private 
talks on that. Scharping is not looking for candidates. This 
is not the right expression. "I would say that he is sorting 
them out," Verheugen said.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- As a consequence of the election 
defeat in Lower Saxony, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] 
Bundestag Deputy Wolfgang Lueder has called on his party to vote 
for Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] candidate Johannes 
Rau as president in the last ballot in the Federal Assembly on 
23 May. "We should spell with the liberal alphabet in the 
Bundestag election, in order to demonstrate independence," 
Lueder said in an interview with the BERLINER MORGENPOST 
(Wednesday [16 March] edition). Accordingly, the FDP is to vote 
for its candidate Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher -- who is said to have 
no chances -- in the first two ballots, but for Rau in the last 
ballot. 
  In this way, the FDP would also accept that the SPD is today 
the strongest party and that only one SPD presidency (Gustav 
Heinemann) in the FRG's era is "unhealthy" for the SPD, Lueder 
said. North Rhine-Westphalian FDP Chairman Juergen Moellemann 
had also advocated support for Rau. So far, the FDP leadership 
in Bonn has refused to commit itself.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Red Army Faction (RAF) has raised 
its voice again: In an 18-page letter to the east German daily 
JUNGE WELT, the terrorists denied that Klaus Steinmetz, an 
undercover agent of the Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV], was an RAF member. Steinmetz was involved 
in the antiterrorist operation at Bad Kleinen on 27 June 1993. 
The RAF letter, which was described as authentic by BfV experts 
on Wednesday [16 March], notes; "Had our contacts with 
Steinmetz been as intensive and close as claimed by the state 
protection propaganda, we would have uncovered him as a cop." 
  According to the RAF, there was no cooperation with 
Steinmetz 
for the blowing up of the "Weiterstadt jail" on 27 March last 
year. Statements claiming anything else are "lies." The 
"alleged membership of a cop in the RAF" is an action intended 
to further defame the organization in public. Such rumors were 
spread by the "state protection propaganda." 
  According to information provided by JUNGE WELT, the 
declaration also rejects BfV claims that the RAF stayed in touch 
with supporters through a mailbox. The sole purpose of these 
statements is "to destroy the communication structures of the 
radical left." 
  For the first time, the terrorist organization has made a 
public comment on the split between the RAF prisoners. The 
split was not caused by the negotiations of lawyer Christian 
Stroebele on easing prison conditions and the early release of 
prisoners, but the fact "that some prisoners had split with us 
long ago." The split was the result of "longstanding 
antagonisms that have never been clarified." 
  The RAF wants to stick to its objective of establishing, 
along with all revolutionaries, a "social counterpower from 
below," and to dispense with attacks against leading state and 
business representatives. The underground organization has 
admitted its failure. "We are further away from the social 
identifiability of our struggle than in past years." 
  The letter further states: "Since the operation of Bad 
Kleinen, it has been absolutely clear to us that parts of our 
attempt in past years to use our concrete initiative for the 
freedom of the prisoners, even in an era of transition to new 
regulations, has failed and cannot directly continue that way." 
Today the left "is not tangibly present, not because there are 
no leftists, but because they hardly try to develop a joint 
force." 
  "In the developments of the past few years that culminated 
in 
the rift, we crashed on the basis of reality. As political 
setting prisoners/RAF [als politischer Zusammenhang 
Gefangene/RAF] we have not managed to build on the experience of 
23 years of struggle for this process together. This is a 
defeat," the extensive paper further states. It is signed: 
"Red Army Faction, 6. 3. 1994" and bears the RAF emblem with a 
submachine gun against the background of the five-pointed RAF 
star. According to JUNGE WELT, the letter was received by the 
Berlin daily on 15 March.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- According to economic researchers, 
a self-sustained upswing in the east has not yet begun. State 
help for company investments and the labor market in the new 
laender must be concentrated more strongly in the future, a 
study conducted by the Ifo Economic Research Institute in Munich 
and the Halle Economic Research Institute (IWH) at the order of 
the FRG Finance Ministry says. The balance sheet after three 
years of intensive subsidy policy is mixed. Promotion programs 
continue to be a cornerstone of economic development in the new 
laender. 
  Without this massive help, unemployment would have risen 
even 
more strongly. The study, which is partly based on a poll among 
companies, also shows that both investment promotion and labor 
market policy primarily secure employment. So far, too few new 
jobs have been created. According to the poll, about half of 
the companies have used labor market policy help. Two-thirds of 
the 931 polled companies complained in particular about the 
excessive wage costs, seeing them as a hindrance of further 
development. 
  In view of the competition in the East European low-wage 
countries, the two institutes especially point to the problem of 
the too fast adjustment of wages to the western level, which 
have a negative effect on the competitiveness of existing 
companies and the staring prospects of newly founded companies. 
The state's promotion policy is in danger of becoming only a 
"repair instrument for misconduct in wage policy." The key to a 
successful promotion policy primarily is, therefore, a moderate 
wage policy, linked with the fastest possible abolition of still 
existing obstacles in administration regarding problems with 
ownership or regarding old burdens.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federation of German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has demanded further measures 
against high unemployment from the partners to the wage 
negotiations and the Federal Government. These should include 
low wages for simple work, wage cuts, and changes in social and 
labor market policy. 
  A resolution by the DIHT Executive Committee, entitled 
"Policy for More Employment," which was published in Bonn on 
Thursday [17 March], says: "In order to control the reduction 
of employment, the parties to the wage contracts must also 
facilitate wage cuts, which make it possible to continue 
employment, even in the case of low utilization of production 
capacities." 
  The partners to the wage negotiations should agree on lower 
wages than so far for simple work. They must take into account 
that after reunification, labor "is now available in 
comparatively larger amounts than capital." This is an 
important cause of unemployment, especially in eastern Germany. 
Therefore, east German wages must be adjusted to the west 
German level more slowly than in the past. 
  DIHT calls on the politicians to lower social security 
contributions. Performances by unemployment and pension 
insurance arising from reunification should be financed by the 
state. Active labor market policy must be accessible for more 
unemployed by reducing the expenditure for the individual. 
  Furthermore, DIHT demands that reprivatized companies in 
eastern Germany should be exempt from high severance pay in case 
of lay-offs. They should be treated like newly founded 
companies, which are not obligated to implement social plans 
during the first four years.

  [Text] Hannover (DPA) -- The communications sectors of 
Siemens AG (Munich) are achieving 55 percent of the total 
turnover in business with other countries. This was stated by 
Erwin Hardt, a member of the Siemens board of directors, in a 
talk to correspondents at the CeBit '94 fair in Hannover on 
Wednesday evening [16 March]. New business continues to be weak 
in Germany. In total, turnover in the 1993-94 business year 
amounted to 13.3 (13.5) billion German marks [DM]. The special 
economic development because of the new laender, which provided 
strong stimuli for growth, is over. However, the strong 
business abroad -- above all, Southeast Asia provides dynamic 
stimuli -- cannot yet compensate for the weak domestic demand. 
  Siemens is attentively watching the extremely fast 
developments of telecommunications, Hans Bauer, member of the 
central board of governors of Siemens AG, noted. New market 
conditions are developing because of progressive liberalization 
and the pressure of international competition is rising. Price 
also becomes a competitive factor that determines everything. 
The annual price cuts of up to 20 percent can be compensated 
only with larger shares in the world market. As a result of the 
concentration process in the communications industry, it is to 
be expected that only four or five world market companies with 
their own system development will be left. Smaller companies, 
on the other hand, still have good opportunities on the market 
as flexible suppliers of special equipment. 
  According to Werner Schmuecking, member of the Siemens 
Private Communications Systems (PN) sector board of directors, 
the Siemens subsidiary Rolm in the United States is experiencing 
a particularly successful development within the framework of 
the strong increase on the international markets. In new 
business, it has achieved a growth of 11 percent calculated on a 
dollar basis. PN received orders in 1992-93 worth DM6 billion 
and had a turnover of DM6.3 billion. In Germany, PN wants to 
strongly expand the business with analogous and digital cordless 
telephones. "This year we want to market 1 million cordless 
telephones," Schmuecking said.

  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Tyll Necker, president of the 
Federation of German Industry (BDI), expects the economic 
development in Europe to stabilize. The revival of demand for 
exports, which initially started in the United States, Asia, and 
parts of Latin America, is obviously spreading to the European 
countries, while domestic demand remains weak. Necker fears an 
unpredictable avalanche of costs, involving billions of German 
marks, associated with the introduction of nursing-care 
insurance. The BDI president said at the Economic Press Club in 
Munich on Wednesday evening [16 March] that he will not run for 
office again: "I will be available only until the end of 1994." 
  Necker does not expect any short-term improvement concerning 
the high unemployment, the "number one political and social 
issue." The reduction of jobs in industry, which was 8 percent 
in the old laender in 1993 and 45 percent in the new laender, 
will continue in 1994, though not so fast. "Part-time work is 
not a panacea," the BDI president said. However, it does 
alleviate the overall problem. He sees an enormous opportunity 
in expanding services. 
  "Concerning labor costs we must restrain ourselves," Necker 
demanded. Otherwise, more shares in the world market will be 
lost. Concerning the 1994 wage negotiations he said that "a zero 
to 2-percent round is a partial correction -- but that alone 
will not be enough." He criticized the current fleshing out of 
the social plans as a new form of creating capital, in which 
people laid off get severance pay even though they have long 
since found another job. 
  Necker said that the compromise on nursing care insurance is 
completely wrong. It is absolutely incomprehensible that there 
will be no material examination of the actual need for nursing 
care and that, in the future, too, those who are well off get 
the same as anybody else. As the example of the Netherlands 
shows, an explosion of costs is to be feared. "As soon as it 
has made the rounds that one gets money for one's grandmother, 
and that even tax-free, grandmother will become a case for 
nursing care and it will no longer possible to finance this 
insurance."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "G-7/Jobs: Debate Extensive, </F>
Solutions Few at Jobs Summit"] 
  [Excerpts] Detroit, Michigan, 14 Mar (ANSA) -- The range of 
theories and recipes expounded may have been wide and brilliant, 
but as forecast on the eve the Group of Seven's first-ever 
summit on employment here finished its first day of debate 
without achieving agreement on any concrete guidelines for 
fighting joblessness in the world. [passage omitted] 
  Clinton also listed some of the national tasks facing the 
G-7 
countries. For the United States, he said, the task is to 
reduce its budget deficit; for Japan, to increase domestic 
demand; for Europe, to achieve lower interest rates. 
  Even those countries whose delegations had doubts about the 
U.S. proposal for the creation of a G-7 employment task-force -- 
a German official said it would be "superfluous" -- admitted 
Washington's determination to, as Italian Labour Minister Gino 
Giugni put it, "roll up its shirt-sleeves." 
  Giugni, who is leading the Italian delegation with Treasury 
Minister Piero Barucci, added that the United States was now a 
country "deeply divided between rich and poor" whence Clinton's 
commitment to rebuilding the lost inheritance of the New Deal. 
  "The Clinton Administration is clearly aware of the problem 
and looking for a solution, even if it isn't easy to find a path 
for the moment," he said, adding that the first day of debate 
"zigzagged" along, from "cyclical and structural unemployment to 
flexibility, with great stress on professional training." He 
also showed little surprise over Clinton's reference to the 
success of business and technological innovation in northern 
Italy: "The model clearly works, and other countries are envious 
of it." 
  According to Giugni, the meeting here should certainly 
produce a joint statement projected towards the Naples summit 
which will conclude Italy's G-7 presidency. 
  But he warned against expecting immediate concrete steps: 
"It 
would already be a success if an agreement was reached on the 
need for the more industrial countries to stake their money on 
technological renewal and youth training if they want to remain 
in the G-7 ambit, rather than slipping into the Second 
Division." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta by </F>
Paolo Valentino during his flight to Vilnius, Lithuania; date 
not given: "Andreatta Vents Anger Against Berlusconi: `Shameful 
and Cynical Promises to Poor People'"] 
  [Text] Vilnius, Lithuania -- The metaphors and tone were 
the deadly and refined ones of someone who learned the art of 
polemics in a British university. And the substance was 
political dynamite. This, especially in view of the fact that 
the attacks came from the foreign minister. But not even his 
own office and the silent retinue of diplomats that surround him 
were able to contain Beniamino Andreatta. On the aircraft that 
took us to Vilnius, Andreatta turned away from the subject of 
his meeting with Boris Yeltsin and the rights of the 
Russian-speaking minorities of the Baltic. He lit his pipe. He 
gave his trousers a hitch, tucking his necktie into the 
waistband. He half-closed his eyes, and then he let loose. 
  "There is a tide of anger in Italy and, as always, it has 
right-wing characteristics. Those who shook the tree have 
caused the apples to fall in their neighbors' garden. The Left 
concentrated on the issue of the other parties' reputation 
instead of on the country's problems, thus creating the 
conditions for an explosion by the Right. The most 
disconcerting aspect of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is the 
way he has taken advantage of poor people. His are the typical 
promises made in countries lacking a political structure. And 
it is the poor consumers of escapist television who are 
attracted by this campaign, with its cynical plan." 
  [Valentino] Why "cynical," minister? 
  [Andreatta] Because it is a form of Reaganism after the 
event, a reintroduction of the "supply side" theory -- to cut 
taxes in order to bring in more taxes -- that did not work in 
the United States, where it left a deficit that has constituted 
its greatest problem for the past nine years. The disgusting 
aspect of this operation is this rummaging around in the attic 
for the remnants of a past era, pulling back out of the chests 
of the right the carnival costumes of past seasons and, having 
shaken off a little dust, selling them back to the Italian 
people, who are somewhat unaware of the complexity of the 
problems. This, in the midst of an adjustment that is working 
-- as the Amato and Ciampi governments have basically succeeded 
in doing -- when we should not be loosening our grip. (A 
steward informed us that we were about to land in Vilnius). 
  So, now we are entering Lithuania. Here we have a government 
which, also because of anger and the difficulty of adhering to 
the policy of liberalization, has become a government 
representing continuity with communism. Of course, in political 
terms they have done well, they too have fought for 
independence, but they are managing liberalization as the 
communists may have managed it, with a few concessions, and 
privatizations that are more apparent than real. 
  [Valentino] But you do not use the word "disgusting" in 
connection with [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, 
PDS] Occhetto; you seem gentler in your criticisms.... 
  [Andreatta] Well, strong language has been used for the past 
40 years. The fact that the intellectual world of the Italian 
Left maintains some ambiguity and that its contempt -- which may 
not be a political category -- is never brought to bear on 
continuity is such old hat that it is not worth emphasizing. 
The desire to break with the past and not to cultivate memories 
or feelings, which I have found in Russia, is something that I 
do not find among my friends on the Italian Left. In Italy the 
former communists need to maintain their feelings. And I find 
that this leaves me very suspicious about their ability to 
tackle properly situations demanding a genuine market economy 
philosophy. Then there is this operation -- one of the worst on 
the Italian Left -- of exploiting people's reputation. 
Basically, the democratic defense against the left is regarded 
as 1948-style anticommunism. 
  [Valentino] But anticommunism in 1948 was a fact... 
  [Andreatta] Because it is part of our history and was an 
important factor. If it had not been for that.... The result 
can be better imagined looking at this part of the world. 
  [Valentino] What frightens you in Italy today? 
  [Andreatta] The regression of politics to primordial 
feelings, to anger. Videocracy, which has reduced political 
reasoning to gestures and insults. This goes profoundly 
contrary to our history. In order to cast off politics as the 
supreme art of compromise, which unfortunately has a negative 
connotation in Italy, shouting has been introduced, which allows 
even criminals to conceal their past offenses. Even P2 
[outlawed Masonic lodge] members are shouting.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Plan To Assassinate Anticorruption </F>
Prosecutors"] 
  [Text] Messina, 17 Mar (ANSA) -- Investigators used bugs 
planted in a southern Italian prison to learn of a plan to 
assassinate prosecutors Antonio di Pietro of Milan and Angelo 
Giorgianni of Messina, judicial sources said Thursday [17 
March]. According to initial reports, which were denied today, 
details of the plan had been learned from Luigi Sparacio, a Cosa 
Nostra supersnitch who has been collaborating with authorities 
for several months. The first stage of the plan to do away with 
the two anticorruption prosecutors had already gone into 
operation, said well-informed sources, with a mysterious person 
paying 500 million lire (300,000 dollars) to an unnamed 
recipient to lay the groundwork for an attack. Little 
information has emerged about investigations into the case, 
since three sticks of explosives were found near the elevator 
that goes to Giorgianni's office in the Messina palace of 
justice. The explosives had no fuse or detonator. Security has 
been stepped up around the Messina prosecutor's office.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Prime Minister Felipe </F>
Gonzalez by EFE President Alfonso S. Palomares; place and date 
not given: "Felipe Gonzalez Asserts That Whoever Commits Crime 
of Corruption `Ends Up Paying'"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez is convinced that 
"whoever commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends 
up paying." The head of government made this general assertion, 
at a time when evidence of the improper use of secret funds is 
proliferating, in an interview with EFE agency President Alfonso 
S. Palomares. Gonzalez asserted, "contrary to the doomsayers," 
that "the crisis is beginning to be surmounted," and expressed 
his confidence that the coming PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers 
Party] congress will serve to make the party "a more transparent 
organization in its functioning and in its funding." 
  The Socialist leader regards as unfounded the impression 
that 
some cases of corruption go unpunished in Spain. According to 
him, what happens is that judicial investigation is sometimes 
slow and causes some frustration because there is no immediate 
response. "But there is not the slightest doubt that, in general 
terms and respecting what is the rule-of-law state, whoever 
commits a crime within what is termed corruption ends up 
paying," he asserted. 
  Gonzalez tried to convey hope and optimism about the future, 
and to this end argued: "It can in no way be believed that we 
are in a stage of decline, even though we are in a crisis 
situation." 
  In his opinion, the fact that 5,000 net jobs were lost in 
February, as against the 48,000 lost in February 1992, shows 
"the trend is changing." This will be seen in foreign trade, 
"and, appreciably, in tourism and the construction industry." 
  "We are beginning to recover a much more positive path from 
the economic viewpoint. This will be slow, and the structural 
problems must continue to be combated. And I also say, contrary 
to the doomsayers," Gonzalez added, "that the crisis is 
beginning to be surmounted." 
  The prime minister announced that he will give the struggle 
against unemployment top priority, at the same time as 
continuing the effort to contain the deficit. According to the 
PSOE secretary general, the welfare state needs to "readjust." 
"It is necessary to curb any kind of abuse, and try to order 
the welfare state in such a way that it will survive," he stated. 
  Gonzalez explained that the basic intention of the labor 
reform prepared by the government and now submitted for debate 
in parliament is to facilitate enterprises' adjustment to the 
changes, an adjustment in which employers and trade unions 
should have more prominent role and the government a less 
prominent one. 
<H5>  Investment Confidence </H5>
  From his viewpoint, the suspension of payments by the 
Santana 
plant in Linares (Jaen) is not a sign of foreign investment's 
loss of confidence in Spain but a result of the crisis. "If 
there were some element of loss of confidence, we would have to 
do whatever is possible to regain confidence," he added. 
  Nine months after the parliamentary elections, the prime 
minister believes that 9 million citizens gave him their support 
to promote the culture of pacts between the parliamentary 
forces. The "change on change" also consists, he added, of some 
aspects of economic policy and of imparting a new impetus in the 
autonomy and institutional spheres. "And we will continue along 
this path," he stated. 
  Following several months of agreements between the 
government and Convergence and Union, he stated that they have 
both seriously discussed such important issues as the course in 
the struggle against the deficit and tax incentives for 
investment. "There has been no kind of pressure or that 
impression which some people sometimes wish to give of 
horse-trading, which is an extremely unpleasant thing because it 
is unfair." 
  And he took the opportunity to rebuke the People's Party for 
its criticisms of that cooperation. "Our conduct has been 
serious and much more responsible than that of those who are 
shouting against it, and who would probably be doing the same 
thing if they were in the position in which we find ourselves." 
  "I believe," the prime minister added, "that it is very 
important for our country that the moderate nationalists in 
Catalonia should become involved with the state's government, 
with Spain's governability. It seems to me that this is 
important." This contribution benefits the Catalan nationalists 
themselves in the sense that "they know very well that if Spain 
as a whole fares well, if the Spanish economy as a whole fares 
well, Catalonia fares well within that whole." 
<H5>  Impetus to Autonomy </H5>
  Gonzalez stated that, following the extension of the 
so-called slow track autonomous communities' powers, the 
government will now make "an effort to complete the so-called 
historical communities' autonomy statutes. We are trying to 
complete (the autonomy framework), but to complete it in terms 
which are somewhat relative from the historical viewpoint. This 
does not mean," he warned, "that the area of friction between a 
power which is being decentralized and a power which is being 
assumed on the basis of decentralization will disappear for 
ever." 
  In order to explain that warning, he pointed out that "even 
as centralist a state as France has a constant process of 
discussion on the elements of administrative and political 
decentralization." 
  With respect to the negotiations with the People's Party to 
select the holders of vacant institutional posts, the prime 
minister stated that if the People's Party insists on making 
some agreements conditional on others, the government "will try 
to seek a solution." After acknowledging that the People's 
Party -- if not exactly its chairman, Jose Maria Aznar -- is an 
electoral alternative, he added that "whether it could be 
defined as an alternative in terms of its program is another, 
and much more debatable, matter. Every month and a half or two 
months, they say that they are presenting a new economic 
program...." 
  Gonzalez trusts that Spain's dispute with Norway within the 
framework of the enlargement of the European Union over the 
fishing quota for Spain in that country's waters "will be 
resolved over the next few days." 
  With respect to the presence of Spanish troops in Bosnia, he 
explained possible future contributions in this way: "We are 
one of the few countries which have a presence in the area, and 
we are making an enormous humanitarian aid effort, at the limit 
of our means. If it were a matter of rounding off this effort 
with another company, it would be possible; if it were a matter 
of doubling our effort, this honestly would not be possible for 
us, and therefore we have said so." 
<H5>  "I Have Not Asked and Do Not Ask for a Free Hand" </H5>
  "I have never used this expression, because I do not like 
it. 
The strength which I may have had within the party has depended 
basically on my availability. Hence I have not asked and do not 
ask for a free hand." With this statement, Felipe Gonzalez 
tried to clarify in the interview with the EFE agency what 
exactly his stance is on the coming PSOE federal congress, which 
will begin next Friday [18 March]. 
  "What I have always asked of my comrades and will continue 
to 
ask," Gonzalez said, "is not to ask me to work against my 
conscience or my personal convictions. I am in agreement with 
the resolutions of the majority of my comrades, I work well; if 
I disagreed and felt that I was in a minority, I could not 
shoulder the majority's responsibilities." 
  The Socialist leader advocates as a general rule that voting 
be individual and public, delegate by delegate, "in all 
proceedings of the congress and in the life of the party in 
general. And it should be secret for the election of officials." 
  The candidate for reelection as secretary general wants the 
PSOE Federal Executive Committee to have from this congress 
onward a standing committee which will meet more frequently than 
the team as a whole. He also wants "part of that leadership to 
deal with internal matters and for the main part of the 
leadership to deal with conveying to society what the party's 
tasks must be." 
<H5>  Bar for Women </H5>
  Gonzalez agreed with the "aspiration" of a "democracy of 
parity," in which men and women will be represented equally. 
"How we move from this situation to achieving that aspiration 
is another matter," he added: "Some people sometimes become 
annoyed because I say that the problem which we still have is 
that we are jumping one and a half meters, and if we set the bar 
at 2.2 meters, somebody will be tempted to pass under the bar 
and not try to jump. What we must do is to be raising the bar 
in order to achieve the aim of a `democracy of parity,' which 
seems to me one of the major elements of change for the society 
of the future in Spain." 
  From his viewpoint, the main conclusions of the congress 
should be "the intention to fight unemployment as an essential 
factor in surmounting the economic crisis, and to make the party 
a transparent organization from every viewpoint in its 
functioning and funding, so that the intention to open itself to 
society and be in constant contact with it is apparent."

<F P=106> [Article signed SK: "The Second Financial Stabilization </F>
Program Is Underway -- The Confederation Is Expected To Save 475 
Million Swiss Francs Per Year"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Bern, 15 Mar (ATS) -- The Confederation is expected 
to save around 475 million Swiss francs [SFr] each year from 
1995 onward, with the implementation of the second financial 
stabilization program. The National Council has implicitly 
agreed with the Upper House on resolving the final 
disagreements. The option of "slowing down expenses," an 
instrument which aims at imposing some financial discipline on 
parliament, remains open at this time. 
  Both houses [of the Federal Assembly] have agreed to 
postpone 
to a later date the elimination of the optional AVS [special 
insurance plan] for Swiss citizens living abroad. They have 
also given up the idea of cutting subisidies to the disability 
pension fund. Parliament thus has reduced the savings projected 
by the Federal Council by SFr110 million. 
  Slowing down expenses will be dealt with as a separate 
issue. 
The support of an absolute majority of members of parliament -- 
not only the majority of the deputies present -- will have to be 
obtained to approve new substantial expenses. The Council of 
States had considered this system too difficult to implement and 
sent it back to its commission for further examination. 
  Moreover, the 1993 stabilization program includes measures 
which are under the sole responsibility of the Federal Council; 
they should allow yearly savings of SFr900 million. A third 
program is already being prepared. Its objective is to deal 
with the structural deficit -- independent from the economic 
situation -- and save SFr4 billion through a reduction in 
expenses and an increase in incomes. The Confederation recorded 
a SFr7.8 billion deficit in 1993.

  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Wednesday [16 March] the Federal 
Government regretted the new delay in the membership 
negotiations. The agreement with Norway on the fishery issue, 
which was achieved over last night, is to be "emphatically 
welcomed," in particular since FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
played a "decisive part" in it, Deputy Government Spokesman 
Norbert Schaefer said. 
  Without mentioning Spain and Britain by name, the Federal 
Government expressly regretted "the attitude of two partners," 
who have once again prevented a restructured blocking minority 
for votes in the larger Union. However, Bonn confidently hopes 
that a final agreement can be achieved at a special meeting next 
Tuesday.

  [Text] Kiel (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the 
Free Democratic Party of Germany, wants to submit to the 
European Union [EU] a Baltic Sea promotion program that would 
provide resources for the development of the region. This was 
announced by his state minister, Helmut Schaefer, at the opening 
of the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days of the Baltic Sea countries 
in Kiel on Tuesday [15 March]. With its aid, the European Union 
has contributed to the Baltic Sea countries' development. In 
view of the challenges, such as the integration of the eastern 
Baltic Sea countries into the EU's transport policy, the aid, 
however, is not sufficient in the long run, Schaefer said. 
  The European Union in 1994 must conclude free-trade 
agreements with Poland and the Baltic states. "One of the 
objectives of the German EU Presidency in the next half year 
will be to conclude associate membership agreements with the 
Baltic states as soon as possible, including the prospects for 
future membership," he said. 
  Schleswig-Holstein Minister President Heide Simonis, of the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany, has called for an opening of 
Western markets for the Eastern reformist countries. Despite 
the economic differences, the Baltic Sea region has great market 
opportunities. To utilize these opportunities it is necessary 
to improve the transport infrastructure. This includes the 
construction of the A 20 Baltic Sea highway. Apart from the 10 
Baltic Sea countries, the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days are also 
attended by Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

  [Text] The Commission raised no objections to the 
implementation of the German research and development (R and D) 
state aid programme entitled "EUREKA-Programm JESSI [Joint 
European Submicron Silicon Initiative]." 
  The scheme with a budget of 307 mio [million] German marks 
(about 156 mECU) up to 1996 supports basic industrial research. 
  The objective of JESSI consists in creating a know-how and 
research network throughout Europe, in which scientists, 
producer of components and systems user work together in order 
to ensure an European independent position regarding the basic 
technology of microsystems. Beneficiaries are enterprises and 
scientific institutions. 
  The notified intensity of 50 percent gross for basic 
industrial research projects, 60 percent gross for this type of 
research in the former GDR, 60 percent gross for SMEs [small- 
and medium-size enterprises] and 65 percent gross for SMEs 
conducting such research in the former GDR is in accordance with 
the Community framework for state aids for R and D and previous 
decisions by the Commission. 
  The aids for R and D given under the programme 
"EUREKA-Programm JESSI" can be considered to be compatible with 
the common market since they promote the execution of an 
important project of common European interest. They may 
therefore profit from the exemption provided for in Articles 
92(3)(b) of the EC-Treaty and 61(3)(b) of the EEA-Treaty.

<F P=106> [Report by James Landale and Philip Webster: "Tories </F>
Divided on Plan To Cede More Power to Brussels"] 
  [Text] John Major faced a new Conservative split on Europe 
last night as Douglas Hurd fought to prevent a weakening of 
Britain's voting strength in the European Union. 
  The Foreign Secretary was under attack from all sides in 
Brussels as EU [European Union] ministers argued over how voting 
arrangements should be adjusted when four new countries join the 
union. Only Spain lined up with Britain in opposing the changes 
and the talks broke up last night without agreement; they will 
resume next Tuesday [22 March]. 
  Denmark had warned Mr Hurd that he could be triggering a 
serious political crisis, since failure to settle the issue 
could put the enlargement of the community at risk. Niels 
Helveg Petersen, the Danish Foreign Minister, said the British 
position was untenable: "They cannot say throughout their 
presidency that they are in favour of enlargement and then come 
here and try to block it." 
  Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, put more pressure on 
Britain with a telephone call to the Prime Minister expressing 
concern about the danger of the enlargement talks breaking down. 
  But the Foreign Office said last night that nothing had been 
put forward that met Britain's basic requirements. Mr Hurd 
would return home this morning for talks with Mr Major, and 
officials hoped that he would bring with him "something that 
moves in the right direction." British officials said that some 
progress had been made, but the French European Affairs Minister 
Alain Lamassoure said positions had hardened rather than moved 
closer together and some diplomats thought an emergency summit 
might be needed to decide the issue. 
  At the heart of the dispute is a proposal to raise from 23 
votes to 27 the so-called blocking minority that can veto some 
community legislation. Britain, which has ten votes wants to 
keep the figure at 23. Spain is also against the change, but 
has put forward a compromise combining the two positions. 
  Mr Hurd had been warned before leaving for Brussels that 
Conservative MPs would not accept a climbdown, yet 
Euro-enthusiasts insisted that he must not jeopardise the 
expansion of the community that he and Mr Major advocate. Mr 
Major told the Commons yesterday that he was "very much in 
favour" of enlargement, but Britain wanted to ensure "democratic 
legitimacy" and the rights of minorities in the EU. 
  Sweden, Finland and Austria have all agreed the terms under 
which they will join and ministers were last night close to a 
final agreement with Norway. But a failure to settle the voting 
dispute would put their accession in doubt because the European 
Parliament might not have time to ratify the relevant treaty 
before the June elections. Referendums planned for the autumn 
might also have to be delayed, making it more difficult for the 
four countries' governments to maintain the momentum of popular 
support for EU membership. 
  Acutely aware of the dangers, Hans van den Broek, the EU 
foreign affairs commissioner, appealed to Mr Major to put the 
community's interests ahead of his own domestic troubles, while 
the German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met Mr Hurd twice 
yesterday to try to find a way through the impasse. 
  Tory divisions over the "blocking minority" are less 
clearcut 
than during the Maastricht saga, because at least some 
Euro-enthusiasts are dubious about the voting proposals. John 
Townend chairman of the party's backbench finance committee, 
said opposition was spread right across the party. "This is a 
case of blackmail. The commission is proposing watering down 
voting rights to have enlargement of the community." The 
community had a vested interest in enlargement because the 
incoming countries were rich. 
  Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory MP for Chingford, said: "There is no 
need to move on this. There is no real threat. We should just 
call their bluff and stand firm." Lord Parkinson agreed. He 
said Mr Hurd should stand firm, "not out of bloody-mindedness, 
but because what we have demonstrated since the Maastricht vote 
is that Britain has been right in resisting the move to a single 
currency and an evertighter ERM." 
  But Hugh Dykes, chairman of the European Movement, denounced 
his Euro-sceptic colleagues as "neurotic TV chat-show ogres," 
and Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe, said: "We should not lose 
sight -- and we should not allow those opposed to Britains 
membership of Europe to allow us to lose sight -- of the real 
objective of getting enlargement in the national interest."

<F P=106> [Alison Maitland report: "Europe's Farmers Face Stark </F>
Choice Over Production"] 
  [Text] European farmers face a stark choice before the end 
of the decade between tighter restraints on the use of land and 
chemicals or the complete abolition of price support. 
  This is believed to be the central message of a detailed 
strategy document to be considered today by the council of the 
National Farmers' Union [NFU] of England and Wales. 
  The NFU's long-term strategy group, which produced the 
report, believes the recent GATT deal will lead to another 
shake-up of the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP] before 2000. 
  "Current CAP policies are not going to increase consumption 
or bring down the production of cereals and beef sufficiently to 
allow the EU [European Union] to meet its obligations under the 
GATT settlement," it says. "EU farmers are approaching a 
fundamental policy choice." 
  This runs counter to assurances from the European Commission 
and the UK government that no further fundamental change will be 
needed in sectors subject to current CAP reforms to comply with 
EU commitments under the GATT deal. 
  The report is understood to rule out the option of exit 
bonds, under which current agricultural support systems would 
end overnight and farmers would be compensated with a fixed, 
finite payment, which would be tradeable. 
  The strategy group says this could push up the EU's annual 
spending on agriculture -- currently ECU29 billion -- by 60-70 
percent in the short term and would be politically unacceptable 
because it would lead to high rural unemployment. 
  It also dismisses the extension of output quotas -- such as 
those on milk -- to new sectors, saying this would be 
complicated to administer and would conflict with the general 
reduction in government intervention in industry. 
  The choice therefore, would be between tighter controls on 
inputs -- for example, by increasing the amount of set aside 
land or reducing the amount of nitrogen used -- or abolishing 
the link between support payments to farmers and their 
production levels. 
  Farm incomes would be better protected under a system of 
input controls, assuming these would continue to be accompanied 
by subsidised exports and import tariffs. "But they may not be 
sustainable (beyond the l990's) if future GATT rounds force 
lower levels of border protection and export subsidies," says 
the report. 
  The decoupling option would expose EU farmers to competition 
with world prices, putting the full burden of support payments 
on the taxpayer. The report suggests EU cereal prices could 
fall by a further 30 percent before reaching world price levels 
and that this might entail an unacceptably high level of 
compensation. 
  The NFU plans to consult its 100,000 members, as well as the 
government, the wider agricultural industry, and other European 
farming groups, in the difficult task of achieving a consensus 
on future strategy.

Conference on Transport -- the European Union Urges Quick 
Response From Switzerland"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA 
database] 
  [Text] Heraklion, 15 Mar (ATS) -- Federal Counselor Adolf 
Ogi had talks with European Commissioner for Transport Abel 
Matutes Tuesday morning [15 March]. On the second day of the 
conference of EU transport ministers in Crete, they examined the 
consequences of the Alpine project's approval for the European 
transport sector and the negotiations mandate between the 
European Union (EU) and Switzerland. 
  "We have a scheduling problem," Abel Matutes said at the end 
of the talks. "We have raised some technical questions to 
assess to what extent the Alpine project is compatible with the 
transport agreements. If we receive quick answers to those 
questions, we will do our best to ensure that negotiations begin 
at the European Council meeting on transport on 18 April," he 
added. 
  In the afternoon, Adolf Ogi is to meet with his Austrian and 
German counterparts, Messrs Viktor Klima and Matthias Wissman, 
respectively. The day before, he had a long conversation with 
French Minister Bernard Bosson. 
  While agreeing to the sovereignty of the Swiss decision, Mr. 
Bosson held very strongly to the French position. "Today, 90 
percent of all the trucks that cross Switzerland are carried by 
rail. The Swiss want to protect themselves against the 
remaining 10 percent; this is causing problems for France since 
the protection of some [states] means expenditure for other 
[states]," he stated. 
<H5>  No Retaliatory Measures </H5>
  Even though Mr. Bosson ruled out retaliatory measures 
against 
Switzerland, he underlined the "incomprehension arising from the 
20 February vote. Banning trucks at home while allowing trucks 
in other countries is too much," he said. "There is heavy 
traffic between the north and the south and our respective 
citizens want no more trucks. How can we settle this issue 
together," Mr. Bosson asked, while insisting on the need for 
European leaders to tackle this common problem together. 
  Mr. Ogi for his part remains optimistic. "The transport 
policy must develop into an ecological and modern policy. It 
will take a long time to achieve this, and we have to persuade 
our partners. In fact, our message is being heard slowly but 
surely," the federal counselor said.

Kazakhstan, said that they had been "relatively free and

"large-scale fraud." This assessment is different to that of 
other observers, and in particular that of the CSCE

<F P=106> [Report by Annika Saville: "Rao Delays Awarding Hawk Deal to </F>
Britain"] 
  [Text] Despite self-congratulatory declarations on both 
sides, the first official visit of the Indian Prime Minister to 
Britain has been tempered by India's continuing refusal to 
clinch a deal for the purchase of Hawk trainer aircraft. 
  Frustrated British officials admitted yesterday that India 
was no nearer a decision, despite reports that the deal-worth up 
to 1bn [trillion] pounds -- might be finalised during the visit 
of Narasimha Rao. "Would that it were true," said one official. 
"We'd like to say that it is true. But the evaluation process 
in India is some way from completion." 
  Indian sources made clear that Britain could not take for 
granted a deal -- expected to be for 66 aircraft -- because of 
any loyalty India might feel towards its former colonial rulers. 
They said Britain was desperate to win the contract because 
thousands of jobs depended on it and because of the Pergau dam 
trade-for-arms debacle, which led Malaysia to scrap defence 
purchases. But, one Indian source added: "Pressure won't work." 
  British officials insisted that they had not realistically 
expected the deal to be finalised during the Rao visit. New 
Delhi's slow and deliberate approach was both an expression of 
Mr Rao's natural reluctance to be rushed into any decision and 
of the "new and mature" Anglo-Indian relationship, whereby India 
would make an objective choice about the best aircraft at the 
lowest price. 
  On a visit to India 14 months ago John Major took a 
representative of British Aerospace [BAe] to lobby for the deal. 
As one Indian source said: "Pressure did not work then and it 
will not work now." 
  An order would help to safeguard jobs at BAe's plants at 
Brough, Humberside and Warton, Lancashire, and provide business 
for suppliers such as Rolls-Royce. The rival French bid is for 
Alpha jets, made by Dassault-Dornier. One official said the 
problem was largely that the Indians were faced with almost 
"identical products at the same price." 
  Indian press reports say the Hawk deal has already been 
recommended by Indian Air Force experts. Some sources suggested 
New Delhi was spinning out the contest because of what it 
perceived as lack of political support from Britain over issues 
such as Kashmir. "If India gives them this contract there is 
nothing left in its armoury," said one. 
  The Indian decision-making process goes back a number of 
years. "First there was the technical problem of whether they 
could design and build their own planes," said one British 
official. "They decided not to. Then there was the decision as 
to what kind of plane to buy from abroad. Then there was the 
question of whether there is enough money in the budget. And 
Manmohan Singh (the Finance Minister) cares a lot about the 
budget deficit." 
  British officials admit Mr Singh is "an effective operator" 
and say their faith in the successful liberalisation of the 
Indian economy rests largely on his competence. 
  During Mr Rao's visit, General Electric signed a memorandum 
of understanding on a 1bn [trillion] pound deal to build a power 
station in Maharashtra state. British officials brushed aside 
any parallels with the Pergau dam: "You'd be hard pressed to 
get Pergau into this," one said. "It is not a dam; and the aid 
budget for India has been stable for a number of years. We'd 
dearly love to sell arms to the Indians, but it is not a case of 
aid for trade."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Michel Rosten: "The Twelve Ignored"] </F>
  [Text] Andrey Kozyrev met with Warren Christopher at 
Vladivostok airport. After two hours of discussions, the 
ministers held a joint press conference to announce, among other 
things, that they had "reached agreement on the need to end the 
conflict" in Bosnia. The Russian head of diplomacy even dotted 
the "i's": "Our two countries want the three (warring) parties 
to reach a compromise." 
  It could not be clearer that Washington and Moscow have 
decided to settle the matter together, without the help of the 
Twelve. The latter, who serve as labor on the ground, are being 
sent back to their diplomatic sandbox where they will continue 
to play until they have built a real common foreign policy. 
Make no mistake: The turn of events clearly shows the failure 
of the European Union on an issue which George Bush and Bill 
Clinton, at the beginning of his mandate, scarcely wanted to 
touch. 
  The French-German disagreements on the issue of diplomatic 
recognition of Croatia and Slovenia at a time when Belgrade 
started to lose control of them, and the British rejection of a 
WEU [Western European Union] operation against the Yugoslav 
fleet and air force deprived the Twelve of the possibility of 
exerting the influence and pressure without which restoring 
peace is an illusion. Of course, one has scruples about 
criticizing them: They have made praiseworthy efforts to bring 
the warring sides to reason; but they jeopardized them because 
some countries tried to assert their interests in a extensive 
negotiations in which they had no place. For the Europeans, who 
have just been told to go sit in the corner, the turn of events 
will continue to be a disaster unless the lesson in humility 
prompts them, big and small, to make the concessions without 
which their union will continue to yield mediocre results on the 
world political stage.

  [Text] Brussels, March 17 (AFP) -- An agreement between the 
European Union [EU] and Japan to restrict the export of Japanese 
cars until end-1999 could be jeopardised by calls for the accord 
to be extended, a senior EU official said here Thursday [17 
March]. 
  EU Industrial Commissioner Martin Bangemann warned that the 
1999 deadline needed to be honoured in the interests of both 
sides. "Whoever asks today for a prorogation of the arrangement 
jeopardises the current talks," he said. 
  Bangemann was speaking on the first of two days of 
negotiations between the Union and Japan in Tokyo to set levels 
of Japanese car exports into the EU for 1994. 
  His warning was clearly addressed to France. French Industry 
and Trade Minister Gerard Longuet said last week that the 1991 
agreement to curb Japanese car exports to the EU should be 
extended for two years after 1999. 
  EU officials said they wanted Japanese car exports in 1994 
to 
be maintained at last year's level to reflect a stagnant 
European market where sales are expected to show zero or very 
low growth this year. 
  They noted that this would mean higher Japanese car sales in 
Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain, because import 
barriers had kept Japanese penetration in the five countries at 
particularly low levels until 1993. 
  The 1991 agreement provided for Japan to regulate overall 
car 
exports to the EU until 1999 according to demand, raising them 
moderately when the market was good and reducing them in years 
of declining sales. 
  Thus, the two sides agreed to cut Japan's 1993 exports to 
the 
union by 18.4 percent (to 980,000 units -- about 8.4 percent of 
the market) to reflect a 15.9 percent drop in car sales in the 
EU. 
  The 1991 agreement aims at giving European car-makers a 
breathing space until 1999 to restructure and prepare for 
unrestricted Japanese competition. It was prompted by the EU's 
single market launched on January 1 last year, which eliminated 
barriers between EU countries. 
  This meant that national quotas for Japanese auto imports in 
Britain, France, Italy, Portugal and Spain became impossible to 
enforce. 
  The Japanese share of the auto market in these countries is 
supposed to increase gradually until 1999, even in bad years.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, March 17 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
should set 1997 as a date for thinking hard about accepting East 
European candidates into the Union, EU Commissioner for Foreign 
Relations Hans Van den Broek said here Thursday [17 March]. 
  In an address to the Institute for European Studies, he said 
it was too early for the European Union to take countries such 
as Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania, and 
Bulgaria into the Union. 
  But Van den Broek urged the European Union to set a date -- 
"1997 seems reasonable" -- for reviewing the applicants' 
progress towards membership. 
  In the meantime, he said, the European Union should help 
prepare them for membership with carefully targeted economic aid 
and faster lowering of trade barriers against their exports. 
  The European Union has already negotiated European 
agreements 
with the six countries which aim at a single market and state 
membership of the Union as an ultimate goal. But they give no 
dates. 
  The Union is negotiating similar accords with Slovenia and 
the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
  The European Union last year set several conditions for 
membership, including a market economy, stability, democracy, 
respect for human rights, acceptance of the Union's rules and 
the ability of Brussels to absorb the newcomers. 
  Earlier this month the European Union also announced a 
programme for closer political cooperation with the six 
applicants. 
  Van den Broek urged the European Union to go further by 
setting up a "multilateral political and economic relationship 
which would be a true precursor of membership." 
  But he warned that any attempt to add new membership 
conditions would be unpopular in East Europe. His speech 
coincides with increased pressure from the region for 
incorporation into the European Union. 
  Hungary and Poland have said they will apply formally for 
membership very shortly. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said 
last week that he wanted his country in the European Union well 
before the turn of the century. 
  Looking further east, Van den Broek urged urgent aid to 
stabilise the Ukrainian economy. He added that Russia was not 
being left out of the developing web of European economic and 
political cooperation. 
  The European Union's executive European Commission is to 
hold 
a special meeting next Wednesday to consider all aspects of the 
enlargement of the Union into East Europe.

<F P=106> [Report signed G.V.L.: "Fisheries Agreement Opens EU Port </F>
for Norwegians"] 
  [Text] Norway and the other three candidates for EU 
[European Union] membership will probably have to stay in the 
waiting room a little longer. The Twelve must first come to a 
mutual agreement on how decisions are to be made in a Europe 
with 16 members. After that, their accession must also be 
approved by the European Parliament [EP], the national 
parliaments, and the people in the intended new member states. 
The biggest obstacle is still the veto issue and the 
intransigent attitude of Spain, and especially Great Britain, on 
this matter. These two countries are threatening to raise the 
blocking minority from 23 to 27 votes. Doing so, it would 
become more difficult for two large countries and one small 
country to block measures. The Council discussed the veto issue 
until 0400 [Belgian time] Wednesday [16 March] morning, but the 
foreign ministers went home empty-handed. A new, extraordinary 
meeting on general affairs is scheduled for next Tuesday in the 
Council. Until this meeting is held, the matter of enlargement 
will remain stuck in an impasse. British Chancellor Kenneth 
Clark said yesterday on BBC radio that "large countries, such as 
ourselves, cannot reconcile themselves to a system in which 60 
percent of the European population -- represented by a group of 
small countries -- can vote us down on important issues." 
Clarke said that he welcomed the accession of Austria, Norway, 
Sweden, and Finland, but that it "it must be a union in which 
large countries, such as Great Britain, can block issues which 
I, as a pro-European conservative, do not want to see happen." 
The anti-European conservatives -- the so-called Euroskeptics 
-- in the British Parliament, expressed still stronger views. 
"I am delighted that Minister Hurd has adopted such a 
determined position," said Sir Teddy Taylor. "What causes me 
concern is that the Commission is trying to use the accession of 
new countries as an excuse to gain more power for itself. It is 
kind of blackmail." Upon his return from Brussels Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd said only that Great Britain would 
continue to strive for a "fair and sensible" compromise on the 
veto question. However, in the meantime, Great Britain has 
continued to reject all compromises. The proposal to raise the 
blocking minority to 27 votes -- but to reserve the possibility 
of 23 votes on the condition that they are comprised by three 
countries -- has not made much of an impression. 
<H5>  Greek Proposal </H5>
  Tuesday evening, the Greek Presidency also came up with a 
compromise in the Council. The Greek representative, 
Kranidiotis, reported the compromise yesterday morning to the 
European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs. "The Greek 
Presidency has proposed to set up a committee in which experts 
from the national governments, the Commission, and the 
Parliament would prepare a report on the institutional reforms 
in anticipation of the intergovernmental summit in 1996," said 
Kranidiotis yesterday before leaving for Greece. "In 
anticipation of the creation of this committee -- no earlier 
than the Corfu summit in June -- the blocking majority would be 
raised from 23 to 27 votes. The Greek view is that the number 
of votes must end up at 27 anyway. We are proposing, however, 
to do that on a temporary basis. In the meantime, the committee 
of wise men can already debate the institutional reforms." 
  The committee members did not seem to be under this 
impression. The committee was introduced as a committee of wise 
men, but is actually nothing more than an ad hoc committee of 
government representatives, they said. Taken literally, 
Kranidiotis said that the committee should take inspiration from 
the work of Parliament. President Enrique Baron Crespo let his 
displeasure show over the fact that "the Council needs the 
Parliament in order to approve the enlargement, but does not 
feel it necessary to keep us informed." 
  "The European Parliament is not a counter serving merely to 
rubber-stamp documents," Crespo said. 
<H5>  Parliament </H5>
  The European Parliament is not against EU enlargement, but 
demands that it go hand in hand with institutional reforms which 
go further than just determining the number of votes needed for 
a blocking minority. Parliament is advocating what is known in 
jargon as a "super-qualified majority." "Such a majority would 
replace the current unanimity and would mean in fact, the end of 
the veto right," said Therese Lepoutre-Dumoulin, department head 
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
  An possible agreement on the veto issue would not settle the 
conflict between the Council and the Parliament. "We were 
promised that the enlargement would be accompanied by 
institutional reforms. That has not been the case. The only 
thing they are doing now is mathematically extrapolating the 
blocking minority to apply to a Europe with 16 members." 
  Parliament feels that a blocking minority of 27 votes is a 
minimum requirement. It will accept nothing short of that. "If 
they say it is going to be 23 then Parliament will never give 
its approval to enlargement. And without Parliament's 
agreement, the enlargement cannot proceed."

<F P=106> [Article by R. Winkel, in Sissi; date not given: "European </F>
Transport Ministers Tread Lightly"] 
  [Text] Sissi (Crete) -- Really it should not be given too 
much emphasis, but after extensive negotiations with the 
countries involved, the European Commission [EC] has mapped out 
improvements deemed necessary in the East European road and 
train network. Ministers from nearly 50 European countries, 
joined by representatives from the banking institutions, 
yesterday saw the plans for the first time at the second 
Pan-European Transport Conference on the Greek island of Crete. 
  It is a follow-up conference to the one held in autumn 1991 
in Prague. It was virtually self-evident that Minister Maij, 
then EC president, should choose the Czech capital. The Wall 
had just fallen and the euphoria about the newly gained freedom 
and the new market at the feet of a saturated West Europe knew 
no bounds. 
  Since then the enthusiasm has diminished considerably. 
Europe is in the grip of despondency. Since 1991 the number of 
borders has only increased. As subtle reminder to his 
colleagues that there are still regions within the EC which are 
difficult to access, the Greek minister moved the follow-up 
conference to distant Crete. The theme was the development of a 
pan-European transport policy, in particular in view of 
construction and financing of infrastructure. 
  That is easier said than done. At first view the interests 
of the East and West seem fairly related. The need for trade is 
mutual and the development of reliable transport networks is 
therefore regarded as a mutual interest. But then the problems 
start. Which roads or means of transport have priority, and who 
decides that? Who invests? And how will competition issues be 
dealt with. 
  Prague is a good deal closer to Germany than Budapest and of 
course the Czech people want to keep it that way. As a whole, 
the Central and East European countries have no desire to have 
their future transport infrastructure outlined by a couple of 
bureaucrats in Brussels, and they do not want to have the law 
spelled out for them. They often have very different commercial 
priorities. 
  For example Czech Minister Strasky said yesterday that 
transit transport between southeast and northwest Europe already 
represented 40 percent of all goods traffic in his country, 
which puts a lot of pressure on traffic and on the environment. 
Transit traffic has been made easier, but nothing has come of 
the promise to help construct the infrastructure, Strasky 
complained. He did not spell it out, but if the EC does not pay 
attention, there will soon be a third candidate after Austria 
and Switzerland for a transit treaty. 
  Nor is everything going smoothly within the EC. A member 
state like the United Kingdom has no objection to an excellent 
road network being built on the continent, but grumbles at the 
thought of public funding paying for it. That applies to the EC 
itself and just as much to the rest of Europe. France sees the 
conference as a good opportunity to call to order East European 
countries which, in its opinion, have already gone too far down 
the capitalist road. "No protectionism, but also no 
uncontrolled freedom of competition," Minister Bosson told his 
colleagues. 
  Low wages and safety standards in East Europe are causing 
unwelcome competition in goods transport in particular, and also 
leading to a shift to road transport (no longer politically 
correct), the West German Social Democrat Luttge said. He 
prepared the conference in the name of the European Parliament. 
Referring to concepts like the "social market economy," "free 
but fair competition" and "the gradual liberalization of market 
access in accordance with the harmonization of competitive 
conditions," the final declaration drawn up by him sailed neatly 
around all the obstacles. 
  As with the energy sector, it remains necessary to tread 
lightly in talks with East Europe and there seems to be a strong 
need for some security in the form of a treaty or charter. 
There is a reason why today the ministers will commit 
themselves to drawing up a "system of agreed principles for 
transport policies" at the next conference. 
  Minister Maij became impatient ("We have studied the 
problems 
long enough now, it is time for us to make some definitive 
agreements," she said). In this context she found it simply 
part of the bargain that at Sissi EC Commissioner Matutes should 
openly table plans for nine main traffic arteries through East 
Europe. For outside financiers, like the World Bank and the East 
European Bank, these huge projects are given a little more 
political weight this way.

  [Excerpt] In view of the issue of Islamic fundamentalism, 
southern European countries may set up a new military structure. 
According to Defense Minister Fernando Nogueira, who was 
speaking in Paris, Portugal could participate in this structure. 
It would comprise an air and sea structure tailored to 
Mediterranean needs. The project is already on paper and 
includes Spain, France, and Italy. Daniel Ribeiro reports from 
Paris. 
  [Ribeiro] Military cooperation between southern European 
countries appears to be developing with Portugal's agreement in 
principle regarding the air and sea Mediterranean force which 
includes France, Spain, and Italy. It is a force which will 
cover a strategic area in view of the disruption affecting 
Maghreb countries, especially Algeria where military pressure 
from Islamic fundamentalists is increasing. In addition to 
this, Fernando Nogueira also discussed the situation in Angola, 
Mozambique, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, with his French counterpart.

<F P=106> [Report by Patrick Anspach: "EU: $4.2 Billion in Airline </F>
Aid"] 
  [Text] A brief comment by the Lufthansa spokesman in 
Belgium aroused our curiosity. At the last meeting of the 
German company with the Belgian aviation press, Paul Vandermoere 
stated that, according to a "British study," each Belgian 
taxpayer paid some 64,000 Belgian francs [BFr] to Lufthansa's 
competitor on routes to Germany: namely Sabena. 
  As there are some 5.9 million taxpayers in Belgium, we 
understood that the total contribution came to something in the 
region of BFr38 billion. Apparently this was an underestimate, 
as the individual in question had based his calculations on the 
total Belgian population. Which means a true figure of some 
BFr64 billion. 
  For 1993? We thought this was much too high. Or else there 
was some misunderstanding. The only way to form a clear picture 
was to take a look at the report consulted by Lufthansa, but 
which the company -- understandably -- refused to supply. But 
as luck would have it a copy landed on our desk one morning and 
provided some very interesting facts -- and not only about 
Sabena. 
<H5>  Capital Increase... </H5>
  The study in question was carried out by the Economist 
Intelligence Unit [EIU] last year and is entitled "Travel and 
Tourism Analyst." 
  In this study, the EIU acknowledges that "the European 
Commission made no bones about finding out whether or not the 
member states should or should not be airline owners," while 
stating that, for the Americans at least, such a situation is 
inevitably seen as favoring disguised public aid. This U.S. 
accusation is countered in Europe with the argument that the 
rules of Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy Code is also contrary 
to the rules of fair competition. But the fact remains that, 
since August 1991, several government "subsidies" have been 
granted to various European airlines. These are, according to 
the study: 

  -  Sabena: 65.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] ($1.8 
billion) in August 1991, an amount accepted by the Commission, 
on condition that no other aid is granted. The study notes that 
the "package" also includes the wiping off of a BFr16.2 billion 
public debt and a capital injection of BFr19 billion. The 
figure quoted by the Lufthansa representative does not therefore 
relate to 1993, but must be a part of Pierre Godefroid's Phenix 
plan for restructuring Sabena. 
  -  Air France: 2 billion French 
francs [FFr] in December 1991, FFr1.3 billion in mid-1992 and 
FFr1.5 billion in early 1993, or $370, 260, and 270 million 
respectively. The EIU reports that the first injection, 
although directly public, was accepted by the European 
Commission as it was a capital increase by the majority 
shareholder. The second relates to the BNP's acquisition of an 
8.8 
  -  stake in the Air France capital. The third relates to an 
investment by the CDC [Deposit and Consignment Office] and is 
the subject of a study by the European Commission to decide 
whether or not it should be considered as state aid, given the 
CDC's status. 
  -  Iberia: 120 billion pesetas ($1.2 billion) in 
August 1992, an amount accepted by the Commission as part of the 
company's modernization plans, in particular for fleet 
renewal. 
  -  Air Portugal: 35.1 billion escudos ($260 million) both 
to wipe off a debt and convert 3.1 billion escudos into shares. 
<H5>  Or State Aid </H5>
  The recent "report of the wise men," the group headed by 
Herman De Croo, seems to favor the system of "One aid, last 
aid." The above companies (including Sabena and Air France) 
should therefore leave it at that and, in future, expect to be 
self-reliant. The EIU's report, in speaking of "possible future 
aid" (remember that it dates from last year), mentions the Irish 
government's contribution to Aer Lingus ($250 million) as part 
of a restructuring plan, together with a new requirement on the 
part of Air France for which the government would be willing to 
inject FFr5 billion. Since then, it has become clear that Air 
France is likely to be asking FFr8 billion. 
  The question now is therefore that of interpretation of the 
notion of "last chance." 
  The management of the French company is playing a double 
game which although very understandable is difficult to unravel 
as it is addressed at two publics. On the one hand, it is said 
that Air France could disappear tomorrow if (in this order) the 
unions reject Christian Blanc's restructuring plan or if the 
Commission also fails to accept it. On the other hand, it is 
said that France would never abandon its national company, the 
question being the price which would have to be paid. 
  All of which raises some real questions regarding the 
"ethics" of the European Commission's work. Let's assume that 
Delors and his team accept a capital injection from the French 
government of Ffr 8 billion. The aim would be to ensure the 
company's recovery. But what if this recovery included the 
discontinuation of flights to certain destinations, leaving the 
way free for the competition (which by the way?), for example? 
And as Sabena is linked to Air France would it too have to 
indirectly suffer? And, finally, to put it bluntly: if Air 
France were to fold, what would be the fate of Sabena? 
  While a private investor may consider it necessary to inject 
new capital into his company, the question remains whether a 
government which is the majority shareholder also enjoys that 
same right. Of course, you could ask that government to consult 
its shareholders (the taxpayers), but that is rather a 
simplistic view as the unions are at pains to point out. 
  Nevertheless, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit 
(a 
British organization), since August 1991 some $4.2 billion have 
been invested by governments or public institutions in European 
airlines and this may be no more than the beginning. It is 
understandable that certain companies take this badly and in 
particular Lufthansa which has been forced, facing a 
"state-aided Sabena," to cut flights to Berlin due to 
overcapacity. However, the problem lies in the status of 
companies -- whether in Europe or elsewhere -- in which the 
government is shareholder. This sensitive question is far from 
being resolved.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with French Airbus Chairman Jean </F>
Pierson by Edoardo Borriello; place and date not given: 
"Alenia, Beware of the United States" -- first four paragraphs 
are LA REPUBBLICA introduction] 
  [Text] Rome -- When, late in February, the partners in the 
European Airbus consortium learned that Finmeccanica [Mechanical 
Engineering Finance Corporation] had decided to purchase a 10-20 
percent share in the McDonnell Douglas aircraft division -- thus 
laying the foundations for a closer alliance between Alenia and 
the American aviation group -- their sole reaction was a dry "no 
comment," which, however, did little to conceal their serious 
disappointment. 
  The French of Aerospatiale, the Germans of DASA [Deutsche 
Aerospace], the British of British Aerospace, and the Spanish of 
CASA [Aeronautic Constructions Company] -- the consortium's 
shareholders -- would have preferred Alenia to intensify its 
involvement, including financially, in the Airbus programs, 
rather than aim at a closer partnership with the Americans. 
  The Italian company is not part of the European consortium, 
but -- through a 10-year agreement, signed in 1990 -- it is 
involved in Airbus's most recent program for the development of 
the so-called A-321 -- the new 185-seat airliner which is about 
to join Alitalia's fleet. Alenia builds two of the fuselage 
component sections. This amounts to a contract worth $150 
million. 
  Now, barely three weeks later, the "Pyrenees bear" (as Jean 
Pierson, the sanguine French chairman of the Airbus consortium, 
is nicknamed by his friends) broke the silence and, in the 
course of a telephone interview, said that he understood the 
reasons which had led Finmeccanica to approach McDonnell 
Douglas. At the same time, however, he advised Alenia to "leave 
the doors open," and ensure that the handshake with the 
Americans does not become "binding." 
  [Borriello] Mr. Pierson, do you have any counterproposals to 
make to Alenia? 
  [Pierson] No. At present the Airbus consortium has no 
counterproposals to make to our Italian colleagues. We are well 
aware that Alenia's staff is oriented toward McDonnell Douglas 
for reasons of operational continuity, given that they have been 
working for the American group for some time now, and also for 
employment reasons, since Alenia needs to obtain work 
immediately for its plants. 
  [Borriello] Why, then, do you have some reservations 
concerning the alliance with McDonnell? 
  [Pierson] In the first place, because, in order to guarantee 
more work for Alenia, the American group must win a greater 
share of the commercial airliner world market. Will it manage 
to do so? Currently it is the third manufacturer, after Boeing 
and Airbus. Also, I ask myself: By acquiring a share in 
McDonnell Douglas, is Alenia strong enough today to refuse a 
binding agreement in terms of strategic options? In my view, 
both problems are closely interconnected. 
  [Borriello] Could you expand on this, Mr. Pierson? 
  [Pierson] If, in order to maintain certain manufacturing 
lines, Alenia is "forced" to sign this agreement with McDonnell, 
then it will have little freedom of choice within the American 
group's activity sector, and it may therefore find itself 
excluded from many European initiatives. 
  [Borriello] Which, for instance? 
  [Pierson] You know that Alenia is one of Aerospatiale's 
partners in the ATR program for developing regional transport 
aircraft. Should Aerospatiale decide to build a 90-seat 
jetliner, the project would enter into direct competition with 
McDonnell Douglas's similar project, called MD-95. At that 
point, Alenia would be forced to give up the Aerospatiale 
project. 
  [Borriello] What if Alenia is not "forced" to sign the 
agreement with McDonnell Douglas? 
  [Pierson] In such case, it would be well advised to leave 
the 
doors open to new agreements. However, today McDonnell Douglas 
is in no position to impose many limitations on its partners, 
and therefore whether or not any doors are left open will depend 
on the negotiators' ability. 
  [Borriello] Open to a partnership with the Airbus 
consortium? 
  [Pierson] Already some 10 years ago we offered Alenia the 
possibility of joining our consortium with full rights, and 
therefore taking part both in our ongoing and in our developing 
programs. At that time, however, Alenia preferred to work with 
McDonnell Douglas. Now that the need is being experienced to 
reorganize the consortium's production lines and shareholding 
structure, again the Italian company appears to be siding with 
the Americans. 
  [Borriello] But you are also conducting negotiations with 
the 
Americans. What stage have the talks between Airbus and Boeing 
reached? 
  [Pierson] The same stage reached by the negotiations 
conducted some 35 years ago between Sud Aviation Francaise, 
which was then manufacturing Caravelle airlines, and Douglas, in 
order to work out a cost-sharing agreement in relation to the 
development of Caravelle. Those talks never moved beyond the 
statement-of-intent stage, and it proved impossible to translate 
intentions into practice.

<F P=106> [Report signed "itz": "Eastern Trade Will Further Increase"] </F>
  [Text] In the view of the Economics Chamber, Austrian 
trade with East Europe, which last year proved to be an 
important pillar for the economy, will further increase. 
Nevertheless, balanced trade (in 1993 Austria achieved a 16.4 
billion-schilling surplus) is not expected before the end of the 
1990's. 
  In January 1994, however, imports from the region increased 
significantly: They were up 28.3 percent to a level of 3.3 
billion schillings, while exports increased only by 5.6 percent 
to 4 billion schillings, Egon Winkler, head of the foreign 
economic department of the Economics Chamber, said in a news 
conference on Thursday [17 March] on the occasion of the East 
European foreign trade meeting. Exports to East Europe last year 
increased by 5 percent to 59.2 billion schillings, while imports 
decreased 1.2 percent to 42.8 billion schillings. Hungary was 
Austria's most important customer in 1993, with Austrian exports 
amounting to 16.5 billion schillings. The Czech Republic came in 
second, with Austrian exports totaling 11.3 billion schillings. 
  Slovenia was the third most important market in East Europe, 
with imports from Austria reaching 6.8 million schillings. The 
Austrian trade delegate to Ljubljana, Raymund Gradt, said that 
the geographical proximity was one reason for this, but he also 
noted the country's relatively good economic situation and the 
relatively high purchasing power as a result of major wage 
increases in 1993. Moreover, Slovene companies are "prompt 
payers." 
  Poland, which comes fourth, last year imported Austrian 
products worth 6.4 billion schillings. It is followed by 
Russia, with imports from Austria amounting to 6.2 billion 
schillings. 
  As far as transactions with Russia are concerned, Austria 
has 
now provided the opportunity for Control Bank credit guarantees 
again under certain conditions, sources from the Finance 
Ministry have stated. Guarantees will be provided for 
short-term transactions (with a duration of up to one year) with 
a ceiling of 30 million schillings. The special condition in 
this connection, however, is that such guarantees also require a 
bank guarantee from Russia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Carola Kaps: "Learn, Learn, Learn"] </F>
  [Text] Whatever one wishes to think about the fuss made 
about the jobs conference of Detroit, one thing cannot be 
denied: It was remarkable because, for the first time, a G-7 
conference did not focus on interest rates, exchange rates, and 
budget deficits, but on the well-being of the average citizen 
and the social conditions of the industrial societies. The 
ailing city of Detroit -- with its bare economic and social 
wounds -- offered an eloquent background for the frightening 
consequences that may result from neglecting social and 
employment problems. 
  This conference should set a signal for the more than 30 
million unemployed in the industrialized countries and the many 
millions employed who fear for their jobs day after day: Those 
who bear political responsibility for the first time want to 
make it clear at an international stage that they are aware of 
people's fears and of the dangerous effects high unemployment 
has on the social structure of our societies. 
  Even politicians such as Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who 
had taken a skeptical view on the American idea of a G-7 jobs 
conference, finally said that including structural problems in 
the G-7 process did make sense; nobody can afford the political 
controversy between financial and social policy any longer. The 
American hosts even spoke euphorically of the most important 
turning point in the dialogue between the industrialized 
countries. 
  So much for rhetorics. No tangible results were achieved. 
Still, it would probably be wrong to conclude from that that the 
conference was a failure. From the very beginning the American 
hosts' only intention was to learn from one another through an 
intensive exchange of opinions on the shared problem of 
unemployment and to take home new ideas or impulses. 
  Even before the beginning of the meeting, all participants 
knew that microproblems such as unemployment cannot be overcome 
through international coordination but only through domestic 
reforms. All of them also knew that all possible solutions are 
not interchangeable at will but have to be tailored to the 
individual conditions in the national economies. 
  Progress cannot be measured by joint promises for action but 
only by better understanding for the diversities and common 
features of employment problems in the seven countries. In this 
connection it is again and again surprising how little the 
individual responsible government officials are aware of the 
situation and particularities in the partner countries. 
Although the problem of unemployment was presented, analyzed, 
and compared with foreign conditions in all participating 
countries, there is still a great deal of ignorance and much 
reason for misunderstanding. Time and again, the politicians 
succumb to the temptation to measure the partner countries with 
their yardsticks and the very conditions in their countries. 
  One example of the lack of differentiation is the nasty and 
trite controversy over German interests that are said to be the 
obstacle to global growth. The simple American formula that the 
Bundesbank only has to cut its short-term interest rates to 
promote growth in Germany and in Europe so that more American 
products can be sold there was wrapped in diplomatic language at 
this conference and cloaked with the concern for jobs. However, 
the fact that the special German situation is being ignored has 
not changed as far as the formulation of the demand for interest 
cuts and stimulating the demand in the name of creating more 
jobs are concerned. 
  Yet it may be seen as success of the one and a half days of 
exchange of opinions that the American Administration now seems 
to understand that even the Germans would have absolutely 
nothing against higher growth rates, but that the incorporation 
of the eastern laender and the responsibility toward East Europe 
are constituting such a great burden for Germany that the 
current conditions do not permit an additional stimulation of 
demand. Moreover, the Clinton Administration now even accepts 
the German argument that the deep structural reasons of 
unemployment cannot be overcome by a substantial stimulation of 
the economy either. How long such insights will last will be 
seen at the earliest at the spring meeting of the G-7 finance 
minister in Washington in April. 
  A different thing is how the better understanding of the 
individual problems of the partners' labor markets will 
translate into concrete steps to fight unemployment. The list 
of measures regarded as necessary is impressive: making labor 
markets more flexible, deregulation and privatization, life-long 
learning and permanent modernization of qualification, better 
preparation of those leaving school for integration into the 
labor market, greater innovative strength and more modern 
organizational structures of enterprises, innovative wage 
policy, compatibility between social benefits and labor market, 
and specific promotion of medium-sized enterprises as driving 
forces for employment. 
  Even before the meeting, critical voices remarked that in 
all 
industrialized nations the reasons for unemployment had been 
sufficiently studied and the necessary measures were widely 
known. The problem is the implementation of the measures, 
because those who bear political responsibly lack the courage 
and the enterprises and trade unions were clinging to outdated 
patterns of thought. Should the conference of Detroit break up 
rigid behavioral patterns and political positions it would 
indeed have been something like a turning point. However, one 
should not expect any miracles even from cross-border political 
learning.

<F P=106> ["bid"-signed report: "Closer Cooperation in Asian-Pacific </F>
Area"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 17 Mar -- Federal Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt has reiterated his request for more political support 
and better access to the Asian-Pacific markets for German 
enterprises. Rexrodt on Thursday [18 March] discussed the issue 
of closer economic cooperation with the ambassadors of ASEAN 
[Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries Brunei, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. 
  In the spheres of infrastructure, energy supply, 
telecommunications, and environment, in particular, Rexrodt sees 
opportunities to appear in Third World countries of the 
Asian-Pacific area hand in hand with the ASEAN countries. These 
potentials have so far been only insufficiently used, the 
minister emphasized. 
  He briefed the ambassadors on the provision of FRG Hermes 
export guarantees and the federal capital investment guarantees 
for the support of direct investments. Further focal points in 
the talks were the extension of information and consulting 
facilities and the participation in foreign trade fairs. 
  In the federal economic minister's view, the ASEAN countries 
determine to a large degree the economic situation in the 
Asian-Pacific area. Between 1987 and 1992, German foreign trade 
with the six countries doubled to 25.7 billion German marks 
[DM]. According to preliminary figures, exports to the ASEAN 
countries increased 7-9 percent, which is consistent with the 
average annual economic growth achieved by these nations. 
  In late April, the minister is scheduled to visit Malaysia, 
Thailand, and Taiwan. In Bangkok, he will take part in the 
Asia-Pacific Conference. Rexrodt expects important impulses from 
this conference for extending economic relations with the 
Asian-Pacific countries. 
  In Germany, Rexrodt is due to meet the prime minister of 
Singapore and government members from Brunei and the 
Philippines. Indonesia will be the partner country at the 1995 
Hannover Fair. An Asia-Pacific Forum at the fair is intended to 
serve as a meeting place for business people from Asia and 
German business representatives.

<F P=106> ["enn"-signed report: "Reequipment of Nuclear Power Plants </F>
Necessary"] 
  [Excerpt] Braunlage, 16 Mar -- Heinrich von Pierer, 
chairman of the board of directors of Siemens AG, has suggested 
German-French cooperation in reequipping nuclear power plants in 
the CIS. The condition of the Soviet-type facilities is 
alarming, Pierer said at the RWE [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches 
Elektrizitaetswerk] "Energy" Workshop in Braunlage. The safety 
standard is low and, in addition, the importance of safety is 
judged differently than in West Europe. In some places, 
reactors are kept on line even though safety problems would 
require a shutdown. In addition, spare parts are missing and 
the operating crews are often unmotivated. Due to the 
geographic closeness, the European neighbors must be interested 
in improving the power plants, Pierer said. 
  A German-French alliance could form the core of a European 
initiative -- for instance, together with the Swedes and the 
Finnish -- in order to provide financial and technical "help for 
self-help" to the CIS. Some nuclear power plants must be closed 
down for good and, therefore, replacements must be established. 
Pierer said that in this connection, he is primarily thinking 
of the new construction of conventional gas power plants. In 
Central and East Europe, there are still 58 Soviet-type nuclear 
power plants in operation at the moment, 15 of them are of the 
Chernobyl type. The Siemens director estimates the costs for 
reequipment at 12-14 billion German marks. However, equipment 
for only 4 billion marks would have to be imported; the large 
remaining part could come from CIS production. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundesrat approved the 
so-called Berlin/Bonn law today. The law, which has already 
been passed by the Bundestag, sets out the arrangements for the 
move of the Bundestag and government to Berlin. Under the 
arrangements, the German Government is to move to Berlin "in 
temporal coordination with the Bundestag." At the same time, a 
"fair division of labor" between Berlin and Bonn will be laid 
down by means of the allocation of federal ministries to the two 
cities. Several federal bodies are to move their headquarters 
to Bonn. The region will also receive financial compensation. 
The costs of the move are put at around 20 billion German marks.

<F P=106> ["Bl"-signed report: "Chancellor Helmut Kohl Sees a `Light </F>
at the End of the Tunnel'"] 
  [Text] Munich -- The presidents of the leading industrial 
associations and Chancellor Helmut Kohl achieved wide agreement 
at their top-level talks at the Munich International Crafts 
Fair. In Kohl's view, the economic situation is gradually 
improving. The "light at the end of the tunnel" will "have to 
be made bigger." Kohl pointed out that he regards more flexible 
working hours a key factor in increasing industry's 
competitiveness. 
  In the talks the economy was represented by members of the 
Confederation of German Employer Associations (BDA), the Federal 
Association of German Industry (BDI), the Federation of German 
Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT), and the Federal 
Association of German Trade (ZDH). ZDH President Heribert 
Spaeth sees signs for the "coalition of reason" that has been 
demanded by the trade association becoming possible. It is 
beginning to form under the pressure of the present conditions. 
As examples for this development he mentioned that several 
tariff agreements contained the possibility of extending working 
hours or reducing them with a proportionate wage reduction, or 
of concluding zero wage rounds. Only a year ago this would have 
been unthinkable. BDA President Klaus Murmann expressed 
"respect" for the trade unions for achieving this. 
  While Spaeth considered the government's action program to 
promote growth and employment as a "step in the right 
direction," Murmann once again made it clear that industry does 
not agree with the compromise achieved over nursing insurance. 
Yet, he agreed with the chancellor on the necessity of finding 
more flexible economic structures. 
  The chancellor pointed out that the current crisis is not "a 
normal recession, but a deep structural crisis." He does not 
"see any reason to be pessimistic" and is confident that the 
existing problems can be solved. All efforts must be 
concentrated on creating new jobs by stimulating the economy. 
In this context, he spoke out clearly against further subsidies. 
  The chancellor aims at lowering the public share from the 
existing 54 percent to 45 percent by the end of this decade. 
Above all, structures must be made more flexible. As an 
example he mentioned part-time jobs. While 34 percent of the 
working population in the Netherlands work part-time, in Germany 
the figure is only 15 percent. On Tuesday [15 March], the 
cabinet discussed ways of "drastically increasing" the number of 
such jobs in the public services. Kohl considers the tariff 
agreements in the chemical and metal industries to be examples 
for rethinking. Flexible working hours have much more weight in 
these agreements, which is decisive for the future 
competitiveness of German industry. 
  Kohl said he wants to stick to the corporation tax reform. 
Referring to his position as Christian Democratic Union 
chairman, he added: "In our election campaign we will make very 
specific proposals for the next legislative period." 
Furthermore, the chancellor demanded "that the stupid 
animosities toward research be overcome" as well as "a climate 
that is friendly toward science and technology." Whether the 
recent increase in patent fees is sensible, needs to be 
discussed. Asked whether an increase in fuel tax, which was 
suggested by Finance Minister Theo Waigel recently, will 
actually take place, he said: "This is not my idea. You know 
who the head of government is." 
  In Kohl's view, the stimulus for creating jobs in German 
industry must come from medium-sized companies. This motivation 
must be supported. It is not his aim to increase the number of 
employees in the public services any further, Kohl said.

<F P=106> ["kr"-signed report: "Bundesbank: German Export Industry </F>
Is on the Way to Recovery"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The German export industry appears 
to be emerging from the doldrums. That is what the Bundesbank's 
March monthly report maintains in its preamble to an analysis of 
the balance of payments situation, which, with regard to 
long-term capital movements, has registered a record net influx 
of 198 billion German marks [DM] -- four times as much as in 
1992. It reflects expectations surrounding interest rate 
reductions, a more favorable return on the German mark compared 
to U.S. dollar investments, currency speculation considerations, 
as well investments motivated by tax considerations on the part 
of German investors. 
  In the case of trade in goods, despite "a poor situation for 
exports that carried on well into the year," there was an 
improved export surplus of DM59 billion (DM33.7 billion in 
1992), which stemmed from a relatively steep drop in imports. 
The deficit in services fell only slightly to DM36.2 (39.4) 
billion. 
  This was also linked to the decline in registered net 
capital 
yields of DM10 billion, writes the Bundesbank. Because of 
services deficits, German net asset holdings abroad have fallen 
by DM100 billion to DM435 billion over the period from the end 
of 1990 until the middle of 1993. It was also noted that as a 
result of the transfer of domestic savings to foreign capital 
centers prompted by the withholding tax on interest, there was a 
significant increase in capital payments "abroad," which are 
actually attributable to domestic investors. Over the past few 
years, German net capital yield receipts "have been too low by 
several billion German marks." 
  Purchases of securities from abroad rose to a record gross 
sum of DM246 billion. Demand was above all for public authority 
bonds (DM165 billion). At the end of 1993, DM500 billion worth 
of securities issued by public bodies were held abroad, that is, 
almost half of such securities in circulation. 
  German investments abroad totalled DM91 billion gross and 
thus were below last year's level (DM114 billion). The reason 
for the decline was reduced interest on the part of German 
savers in foreign investment certificates: Only DM11 billion 
(DM58 billion in 1992) were invested in such securities. "The 
tax considerations that were to a large extent behind these 
investments appear to have largely come to an end in the early 
part of the summer," stressed the central bank. A "veritable 
sales boom" occurred at the end of the year (taxation of 
half-year profits) resulting in the total of Luxembourg-based 
fund certificates held by Germans between August and the end of 
the year falling by almost a third to DM80 billion.

<F P=106> ["adh"-signed report: "Bundesbank: Communes Must Master </F>
Crisis Themselves"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- The communes must overcome their 
desperate financial situation by themselves. This is the 
conclusion that the Bundesbank has drawn in view of the dramatic 
deficits of the communes, which rose to 10.5 billion German 
marks [DM] in 1993. In the previous year, it was DM9.7 billion, 
in 1990 DM3.6 billion, and in 1989 even a surplus of DM2.2 
billion was produced. The overall debts of the communes stand at 
DM140 billion. 
  In spite of considerable contributions from the "German 
Unity 
Fund," the east German communes produced a deficit of DM7.5 
billion in 1992. The deficit per inhabitant is three times as 
high as in the old laender, especially because of the required 
additional expenditure for infrastructure. 
  Both a stronger rationalization of the administration and 
the 
transfer of communal tasks to private enterprises are required, 
the Bundesbank stressed. It is possible to achieve a balanced 
budget, like in the first half of the 1980's. According to the 
Bundesbank, the strongly differing financial situation of the 
towns in western Germany puts in proper perspective the 
impression that the rise in expenditure that occurred in the 
past few years is a "phenomenon that can hardly be averted" from 
the communes. 
  On the average, personnel costs rose by approximately 8 
percent between 1990 and 1992, which was caused by wage 
increases and the hiring of new personnel. The increase in 
expenditure for material rose approximately 9 percent, and the 
costs for social welfare increased by 12 percent in 1992 alone. 
The receipts of the communes, however, rose by only 6 percent, 
and the transfers from the federal and provincial budgets by 8 
percent.

which is DM16.2 billion, or 2.4 percent, more than in 1992. 
According to the final figures now published by the Finance

<F P=106> [Article by "na": "Easing of Temporary Work Agreements </F>
Provides New Momentum to Employment"] 
  [Text] Duesseldorf, 15 Feb--The modifications in the 
conclusion of temporary labor contracts introduced as part of 
the May 1985 Job Creation Act will not be phased out at the end 
of 1995 but will be extended for another five years. This is 
what the government's action program for greater economic growth 
and more jobs calls for. 
  In 1992, the permanent additional employment effect brought 
on by the Job Creation Act amounted to about one percent of new 
private sector jobs. In other words, between 20,000 and 45,000 
persons found permanent jobs in 1992 under the provisions of the 
Act. 
  These findings are part of an empirical study conducted by 
Infratest Sozialforschung [Infratest Social Research] in late 
1992 on behalf of the Labor Ministry. Commenting on the recently 
published findings of the study, the Labor Ministry notes that 
temporary labor contracts under the Job Creation Act have 
resulted in additional permanent jobs and have thus proven their 
worth as an effective job policy instrument. Generally speaking, 
these findings corroborate the research results obtained in 
1987/88. At that time, the results of this procedure were also 
found to have a positive effect on the labor market. 
  In 1992, between 60,000 and 110,000 temporary labor 
contracts 
were concluded in the private sector nationwide. These contracts 
would have been illegal in the absence of the Job Creation Act. 
The temporary labor contracts in question may be concluded for 
up to a maximum of 18 months by firms with more than six 
employees--where the limitation is applied in the main because 
of uncertainty concerning future economic developments and/or 
where no legally accepted substantive cause for such a 
limitation existed. 
  Temporary labor contracts under the Job Creation Act play a 
markedly bigger role in western than in eastern Germany both in 
terms of absolute numbers and as compared to new jobs. 
  The new Infratest study refutes the concern already voiced 
when the act was passed that making it easier to conclude 
temporary labor contracts would result in the conclusion of only 
such contracts. According to the study, the so-called temporary 
quotient, i.e. the ratio of temporary jobs to total jobs in 
western Germany amounts to just about 7 percent as compared to 8 
percent in 1987/88. The modifications introduced under the Job 
Creation Act thus have not resulted in more temporary jobs. 
<H5>  Main Impact of Job Program Efforts in Eastern Germany </H5>
  Temporary labor contracts concluded under the act's 
provisions account for only a part of all temporary jobs. 
Nationwide, 1.5 to 1.6 million blue- and-white collar private 
sector and public service workers had temporary labor contracts 
in 1993. In the western part of the Federal Republic, 6 percent 
of all blue- and white-collar workers (i.e. 1.1 million) had 
temporary labor contracts. In eastern Germany, 8 percent of all 
blue- and white-collar workers (about 500,000 individuals) have 
temporary jobs. 
  In eastern Germany, the overall total of temporary jobs is 
marked by the widespread use of job creation programs. 
Forty-four percent of the temporaries are taking part in such 
programs. In western Germany, only 8 percent of the temporaries 
are involved in such programs. 
  In western Germany, there are about 400,000 persons holding 
temporary second jobs in addition to the approximately 1.1 
million temporary blue- and white-collar workers. They include 
high school and college students and, to a lesser extent, 
housewives and retirees. 
  In 1992, one out of every three new private sector jobs was 
a 
temporary job. In 1992, some 900,000 new temporaries were hired. 
Fifty-six percent of such new temporary private sector jobs in 
1992 in firms employing more than five persons were limited to a 
maximum of six months. As a consequence, the legal guidelines 
for protection against wrongful dismissal did not apply to these 
jobs. Thirty-seven percent of the jobs were limited to a 
duration of 6 to 18 months and were thus within the permissible 
limits stipulated by the Job Creation Act. Three percent were to 
run for more than 18 months and 4 percent were not specifically 
limited. 
  Temporary labor contracts are more likely to be adhered to 
in 
the public than in the private sector. Those with minimal skills 
and academics tend to be employed as temporaries at a higher 
than average rate. 
  More important than the directly available additional 
possibilities for temporary employment provided by the Job 
Creation Act are the indirect effects which result from the fact 
that the need to show cause no longer applies and the 
concomitantly increased legal security afforded by the 
conclusion of temporary job contracts. 
<H5>  Giving Priority to Hirings </H5>
  From a labor policy point of view the advantage of the Job 
Creation Act would seem to consist above all in the fact that 
employers are encouraged to give priority to hire new workers. 
Wherever economic trends and the needs of employers warrant, it 
is very likely that temporaries will become permanent employees 
at a later date. About one-half of those hired as temporaries 
under the Job Creation Act do in fact end up on the permanent 
payroll. 
  In its evaluation of the [Infratest] study the Labor 
Ministry 
also points out that it refutes the frequently voiced warnings 
and fears that temporary workers would be treated as 
second-class employees. The vast majority of temporaries does 
not feel discriminated against in working life as against their 
permanent colleagues. This applies to efficiency standards, 
employee rights and career possibilities. Ninety percent of 
job-seekers both in western and eastern Germany accept an 
initially temporary position.

<F P=106> [Article by "sm": "Bluem Wants a New Basic Law for Job </F>
Security"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 14 Feb--Labor Minister Norbert Bluem of the 
Christian Demoractic Union (CDU) wants the legislature to pass 
the long expected new rules on working hours and occupational 
health and safety prior to the Bundestag elections. In addition, 
the 1994 Job Creation Act is to stimulate the labor market, and 
farmers' wives are to be provided with a social insurance 
program of their own. 
  The labor minister's most important objective, however, is 
to 
have a nursing insurance law passed during the current 
legislative session. Bluem's draft calls for a new social 
nursing insurance which initially provides for outpatient 
nursing services and, as of 1996, financial support for home 
care as well. Initially, the new nursing insurance will be paid 
for with a 1-percent payroll tax up to the assessment limits on 
health insurance, and that tax will be raised to 1.7 percent 
once the second phase of the program commences. The program 
would spell relief for the health insurance program, for the 
government in its expenditures for the care of war victims, and 
local governments and the laender in their social welfare 
budgets. 
  The government coalition and the Social Democratic Party 
(SPD) agree that industry should not be additionally burdened 
with the contributions for the new nursing care program. Which 
is why a way is being sought to make the working population pay 
for the program in its entirety. To make up for employer 
contributions, the SPD whose support is required in the 
Bundesrat would like to have Whitsun Monday declared a workday 
and to shift the Day of Prayer and Repentance from Wednesday to 
Friday. 
  For its part, the coalition is calling for lower holiday pay 
which may be compensated for by relinquishing leave time, by 
additional work or by transforming one holiday during the first 
phase and a second one during the second phase at the land 
level. The SPD is opposed to this on the grounds that it 
represents interference in the right to free collective 
bargaining guaranteed by the constitution. 
  On 24 February the joint Bundestag-Bundesrat conference 
committee will try to work out a compromise once more. If it 
does not succeed, the nursing care project will not come up for 
a vote during this legislative session. There is lively 
speculation in Bonn whether Bluem will continue in his post in 
that case. 
  The 1994 Job Creation Act is part of the action program for 
economic growth and jobs which the coalition hopes will provide 
a new stimulus to the labor market in the face of 4 million 
unemployed and the upcoming elections. Since there is no money 
in the Bonn treasury for job programs costing billions, the 
primary focus of the planned measures is on bringing about 
improvement by licensing private employment agencies, on paying 
for more job programs with existing funds by lowering wages on 
the secondary labor market and on increasing the incentive for 
Job Creation Program employees to look for jobs on the primary 
labor market. 
  The Labor Ministry has merely provided help in drafting 
these 
programs. The political authorship does not rest with Bluem but 
is claimed by the experts on economics and job market issues of 
the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and FDP [Free Democratic 
Party] parliamentary caucuses. 
  Th new legislation dealing with working hours is designed to 
replace regulations on working hours established in 1938. Bluem 
views those regulations as providing for maximum limits on 
working hours and minimum standards for health and safety. It 
will be up to business and labor to agree on actual working 
hours within the limits of the law. 
  Bluem and Guenter Rexrodt (FDP), the economics minister, 
have 
long been at odds on what to do about work on Sundays. The draft 
legislation continues to call for a ban on work on Sundays and 
holidays but also for a number of exceptions, among other things 
in the interest of job security. According to Bluem's timetable, 
final deliberations by the Bundesrat on the new legislation on 
working hours are to take place on 18 March. 
  Bluem wants the Bundesrat to give its approval to the new 
omnibus industrial health and safety bill on 20 May. This law is 
designed to improve health and safety standards at the factory 
level and to summarize and clarify the numerous existing 
regulations. 
  For the first time ever, the health and safety bill 
establishes basic, uniform rules on workplace health and safety 
standards to be followed by employers and employees in all job 
groups and activities, including public services. The obsolete 
trading regulations governing health and safety in the workplace 
will thus be replaced by a basic health and safety law which 
conforms to EC standards. Bluem's draft also includes the 
regulations contained in the existing health and safety law 
concerning medical advice for employees by factory physicians 
and experts for workplace safety. The existing health and safety 
can therefore be revoked. 
  The centerpiece of the agricultural social reform measures 
which Bluem has prepared in collaboration with Agriculture 
Minister Jochen Borchert (CDU) is a social welfare program for 
farmers' wives. They are designated as entrepreneurs in the 
old-age insurance program for farmers. Farmers' wives active 
prior to the introduction of the reform measures will be able to 
vote for or against inclusion in a social welfare program of 
their own. 
  In the political debate vehement criticism was voiced about 
the fact that farmers' wives will receive taxpayer-funded 
pensions of their own without contributing to the retirement 
scheme themselves. Bluem hopes that the agricultural social 
reform bill which also calls for new rules on contributions will 
pass the Bundesrat on 29 April.

<F P=106> [Article by Fritz Wirth: "Somalia's Distant Effects Reach </F>
as Far as Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Bertrand Russell once wrote that "extreme hopes are 
children of extreme misery." For George Bush, this statement 
turned into an order 15 months ago. He sent 26,000 U.S. troops 
to Somalia for Operation Restore Hope to stop one of the world's 
most terrible famines. More than 2,000 people used to die each 
day under the eyes of a world that had basically been standing 
idly by until then. 
  Hunger has been defeated. These days, the last U.S. troops 
are leaving the country. Still, what remains is not gratitude, 
hope, and relief, but a question mark, fear, and foreboding. 
These troops are leaving as the refugees of an "impossible 
mission." Nothing shows the dubious and problematic nature of 
their withdrawal more clearly than the recent hasty Somalia 
mission by Chief of Staff Shalikashvili. It was a psychological 
morale-boosting trip, intended to dispel the feeling among the 
withdrawing soldiers that they are pulling out as losers. 
  Nevertheless, it remains a withdrawal without a victory 
parade and the most dismal, most dubious, and most dissatisfying 
U.S. military disengagement since the pull-out of Beirut 11 
years ago. The tragic price of the Operation Restore Hope are 37 
dead and 181 wounded U.S. soldiers. It was this price and not 
the fulfillment of the high hopes that dictated the order to end 
Operation Restore Hope. 
  As noble and urgent the motives for this operation have been 
-- it was an operation of aberrations from the very beginning. 
It started with George Bush's extreme hopes that he could 
successfully end the operation even before the end of his 
presidency, that is to say within six weeks. It reveals that 
these 26,000 troops were sent to Somalia on the basis of a most 
deficient appreciation of the situation. Officials in 
Washington saw the hungry people, but not the political reasons 
behind them. 
  When, after a few months, the insufficient limits of the 
mission were recognized, the new administration under Clinton 
made the second embarrassing mistake. It handed over the U.S. 
troops to the military and political incompetence of the UN 
bureaucracy. The United Nations's hunt for clan leader Aidid 
turned into a farce and finally a tragedy, when the dead bodies 
of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. 
The resulting order for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces was 
not determined by strategic and political considerations, but 
exclusively by emotions that were fueled by these grueling 
scenes. 
  It was a fatal and far-reaching decision. All European 
nations immediately followed with the withdrawal of their UN 
peace corps members. What remains are 20,000 UN soldiers, whose 
main contingent is provided by Pakistan, badly equipped and 
incompetently led. They will be at the mercy of a new looming 
civil war. And this new civil war also threatens to bring back 
starvation. In other words: Operation Restore Hope was in great 
probability not a mission of salvation but one of suspended 
chaos. The self-complacent tribute Bill Clinton paid yesterday 
to the returning U.S. troops describing them as great winners 
had a rather embarrassing touch. 
  After all, the real tragedy in Somalia is that the clan 
leaders are now stronger than before this folded intervention. 
They have become legends as a result of their resistance to the 
powerful United States. This is also why they saw no reason to 
make any concessions in the efforts to achieve political and 
diplomatic solutions for the Somalia conflict in Nairobi and 
Cairo in the past few months. Thus, in Somalia, the signals 
continue point to confrontation. 
  However, the consequences of this operation go far beyond 
Somalia. They became visible over the past few months in places 
as far away as Haiti and Bosnia. Somalia defined the limits of 
U.S. military commitment of ground operations and direct enemy 
contact. The readiness to take risks in such operations has 
further decreased as a result of Somalia. At the same time, it 
exposed the limits to military leadership and strategy at the 
level of the highly overtaxed United Nations. What remains in 
Somalia is a minimum of hope and the distressing danger of new 
extreme misery.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Frank Wehner: "Story of a Marriage"] </F>
  [Text] Russian-U.S. relations are like a marriage, as 
Kozyrev has found out. Disillusionment follows the honeymoon, 
which was rather long. 
  However, the crash is all the more violent now: They reveled 
in the honeymoon for two years, then they promised each other 
that a divorce was not what they wanted. Well, if big powers 
love each other, then their situation is different from that of 
small people. 
  Only a short meeting took place in Vladivostok, but it was 
special: For the first time, it was dominated by the prosaic 
bridging of rifts. 
  Quite a lot has to be mended. Spies are moving around. 
Russia is now pursuing a domestic policy course that is rather 
different from what Washington wants and Kozyrev, who has been 
so obsequious so far, even states now that one does not want to 
be a junior partner in foreign politics. Moscow is looking 
askance at NATO's Partnership for Peace, it interferes unasked 
in Bosnia, and it again remembers insolently that the Middle 
East talks are under its auspices. This catalogue of sins is 
remarkable. 
  But the following is strange: Although there is trouble in 
this marriage, the world has not deteriorated. On the contrary, 
as long as Washington decided alone, little good was achieved. 
Now this is different -- at least partly. In Russia, where the 
crash cure was mitigated, the situation is no longer so 
explosive. There is some hope in the Balkans and the PLO is 
again prepared for talks. 
  The cooling down of relations is normally a gloomy affair. 
Sometimes, however, it can be beneficial, even if one lives 
together with someone without being married.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jochen Siemens: "Things Do Not (Yet) Work </F>
Without the United States"] 
  [Text] In Norway, far away from the publicity of television 
cameras, the autonomy agreement for Gaza and Jericho between the 
PLO and Israel took shape. Nevertheless, it is not the 
mediating services of the Norwegian Government that will be 
remembered, but the moment when U.S. President Clinton, arms 
held wide, formed the background for the historic handshake 
between Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat. The U.S. 
Administration, the superpower United States, was the godfather 
of the agreement and signaled the seriousness of the difficult 
new undertaking. 
  At the beginning of March, the scene was repeated in 
Washington, even though at a lower echelon of diplomatic 
hierarchy. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stood behind 
Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic and Croatian Deputy Prime 
Minister Granic when the two initialed a Croatian-Bosnia 
agreement on a common state consisting of cantons. Once again 
the truth has proved true, which is more than well known from 
the times of the Cold War -- namely, that the superpower United 
States can solve problems if it uses its diplomatic weight. 
  This is an impression that became quite obvious shortly 
before, when NATO broke the ring of siege around Sarajevo with 
the threat of bombing [Serbian positions], especially with the 
help of U.S. fighter bombers. There you see, it was thought, 
the Europeans had held discussions and mediated for almost two 
years, but the United States finally really achieved something 
by threatening to use force. Moscow immediately jumped on the 
train, and once again it seemed as if the old superpowers alone 
would do the trick. 
  This impression is correct and wrong at the same time. The 
way in which the opportunity of putting an end to the two years 
of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has developed and is growing 
confirms the old insight that it is not coalitions that pursue 
foreign policy but nations. The attempt to end the war between 
the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims by means of multilateral 
organizations, represented by mediators Vance, Stoltenberg 
(United Nations), and Owen (European Union), proved to be 
unsuitable. The warring parties accepted the mediators and 
repeatedly split them up at the negotiating table. British 
against French, French against Germans, Germans against Greeks. 
Nothing could be seen of the nascent common foreign and 
security policy of the European Union after Maastricht. In the 
meantime, the warring parties seized their opportunities on the 
battlefield. The European Union looked just as helpless as the 
blue helmet soldiers at and between the frontlines. Despite all 
the economic power and political relations, it proved to be 
depressing for the Europeans that "the West" is not able to 
settle crises such as the one in the Balkans without the United 
States. 
  However, just as the Gaza-Jericho agreement was not possible 
without the preparations in Norway, the Croatian-Bosnian 
agreement is not conceivable without long preparations and work. 
And that was done by the European Union, in particular by the 
cooperation between Paris and Bonn. Graphically speaking, the 
Europeans brought in the piano on which the United States can 
now play its triumphal march as the superpower. Ever since the 
action plan was recommended by Foreign Ministers Juppe and 
Kinkel to the European Union last November, a red thread of 
persistent negotiations and flexible plans has been running 
through the emerging peace process for Bosnia. Just as the 
continuing embargo against Serbia, giving up the plan to divide 
Bosnia into three parts contributed to pulling the United States 
into the peace process. Bonn's approach to bring Croats and 
Muslims together led to first negotiations in Vienna and at 
Petersberg in Bonn at the beginning of January; to negotiations 
at Frankfurt Airport; to the Bosnian conference in Bonn; and 
finally to new negotiations in Vienna. Mr. Chrobog, the 
political director of the Foreign Ministry, went to Moscow and 
Washington in November to integrate this dimension in the 
mediating process. If the agreement, in which now the Serbs are 
also showing interest for the first time, is signed in 
Washington in a few days, the European Union has very right to 
be visibly participating. 
  The fact that this will probably be done on the back burner 
is reason enough for the Europeans to think about how they can 
-- as soon as possible -- use more than just their economic 
potential to settle conflicts. "It is too early for us," a 
high-ranking official of the Foreign Ministry stated, referring 
to the need of the European Union to be able to use military 
means to give bite to the Union's diplomacy and foreign policy 
-- bite that is, as the Bosnian war clearly shows, is necessary 
to be successful. 
  The United States should also be interested in that, 
especially since it again and again experiences the magical 
point in foreign policy, from where on prestige and military 
potential are the decisive elements.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kurt Kister: "The Bold Attack of the Cool </F>
Lady"] 
  [Text] In a siege, there are two ways to ward off 
approaching enemies: Either you trust in your own stamina or you 
try to break up the opponent's army by bold sorties. The White 
House, where Whitewater has reached a threatening level, is 
adopting the second method lately -- forward defense. 
Nominating old Washington insider Lloyd Cutler as the successor 
of resigned legal adviser Bernard Nussbaum was such a sortie; 
the second one was made by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who had so 
far been unusually quiet in the Whitewater affair. In several 
interviews with news magazines, the president's wife defended 
herself against criticism of her. 
  It is not so much the content of these interviews that is 
remarkable. Although Mrs. Rodham Clinton admits having made 
certain mistakes (especially the mistake of having participated 
in the dubious estate project at all), she keeps insisting that 
neither she nor her husband did anything wrong or even unlawful. 
She regards the affair primarily as a campaign by political 
opponents aiming at undermining the First Couple's credibility. 
This line of defense is well known. What is new, however, is 
that criticism is concentrating more and more on the First Lady 
-- and this is why her interview offensive is like a curious 
spectacle featuring a besieged person that is forced to do a 
sortie. 
  Mrs. Rodham Clinton is under fire for three reasons. First, 
she was the Clinton family's acting part in the Whitewater 
business. Second, she seems to have been one of the main 
protagonists in the failed attempt to limit the damage to the 
White House (she and her confidante Nussbaum tried to prevent 
the appointment of a special attorney up to the last minute). 
Third -- and this does her the greatest harm -- public 
admiration of how she redefined the role of First Lady has 
turned into criticism of exactly this redefinition. 
  Bill Clinton's wife is the president's most influential 
adviser in many domestic policy issues. In the central part of 
Clinton's agenda of reforms, the health insurance reform, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton had the position of a top politician that 
had neither been elected nor appointed. Admittedly, there were 
other president's wives before her, such as Eleanor Roosevelt or 
Rosalynn Carter, who considered the role of First Lady to be 
more than a mere hostess and smiling benefactress. But never 
before in this century did the White House see a wife as 
cogovernor. 
  Up until the Whitewater affair, this was not considered as 
suspicious. Quite the contrary, the media, which form the image 
of a presidency, praised Hillary Rodham Clinton as a 
revolutionary who perfectly embodies the changing role of women 
in America. For a long time, the wife was more popular than her 
husband. Surprisingly, hardly anyone wondered how Mrs. Rodham 
Clinton could be considered a shining example of emancipation, 
although she owes her present position exclusively to the fact 
that she is married to a man who was elected president. Putting 
it provocatively, one could say that she won her top position in 
a highly "unemancipated" way: through marriage. 
  This is not meant to detract from Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
achievements or even qualifications. As an attorney, she proved 
again and again that success in one's job does not have anything 
to do with one's sex or marital status. Like so many other 
women, she also had to bear the additional burden of having to 
stand her ground in a world that is still dominated by men. 
Maybe it is part of the burden that the empire is now fighting 
back: Bill Clinton is asked how he could let the mistakes 
happen. But his wife is asked what she is doing in a position 
where she could make such mistakes.

<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp editorial: "Veto Coalition"] </F>
  [Text] The Spanish armada can prepare itself for fishing 
in the Norwegian grounds. The controversy surrounding the cod 
has been settled, but the dispute over the blocking minority in 
the Council of Ministers which has been enlarged to 16 members 
continues within the European Union. The majority believes that 
it should be 27 votes (of a total of 90 votes distributed among 
the countries of different sizes). The British and the Spanish 
want to stick to the current regulation of 23 votes. The causes 
of the quarrel are questions of power stemming from different 
motives. 
  Spain is interested in a veto coalition with Portugal, 
Italy, 
Greece, and Ireland. The five countries belong to the less 
prosperous receiver countries. For them "Europe" is a pecuniary 
source that is supposed to bubble. Europe's enlargement might 
curtail their influence. Since these countries, which hold a 
total of 31 votes, are likely not to agree on every issue, the 
proud Spain would like to be in a position together with Italy 
and Portugal, or with Italy and Greece to prevent decisions with 
23 votes (per combination). The proud Britons aspire to the 
same position of power -- together with as few states as 
possible. They are not so much interested in "taking" but in 
preventing. As defenders of classical self-determination, they 
would like to prevent being overruled by other states. 
  Theoretically, a decision can also be blocked with 27 votes. 
It is possible to scrape the required votes together, if need 
be. It might be a little more difficult for the southern 
countries than for Britain. Their attitude is ambiguous: If 
they insist on the smaller blocking minority, they might prevent 
an expansion of the European Union, to which they attach great 
significance. Together with sensible Germans, they welcome a 
shift of the axis of the European Union to the north and east 
and a loose form of cooperation. In view of these advantages, 
an increase of the blocking minority from 23 to 27 is the lesser 
evil.

<F P=106> [Article signed "NDB/KvdB": "Turkish Army Interested in </F>
Belgian Antiaircraft Guns; Five Hawk Batteries With Some 300 
Missiles"] 
  [Text] Brussels/Ankara -- The Turkish Army is interested in 
purchasing cast-off Hawk batteries (antiaircraft guns) from the 
Belgian Army. This was confirmed by the Defense Ministry. 
However, the question arises, how the possible arms sale to 
Turkey can be reconciled with the new arms law. 
  Two weeks ago, officers from the Turkish Army visited the 
depot at Zonhoven, where the excess equipment is stacked up in a 
big shed, waiting for potential buyers. Last Friday 11 March], 
the Turkish military also paid a visit to Lombardsijde, where 
another battery is stored. They asked about the price, and 
requested that Belgians train the Turkish military in operating 
the antiaircraft guns. So far, it is merely an exchange of 
information. This was confirmed to DE MORGEN yesterday by the 
Defense Ministry, which also stated that it is now waiting for 
the Turks to decide whether they will actually buy the Hawk 
batteries. However, there seem to be no other potential buyers. 
  The Hawk batteries come from two Belgian battalions in 
Germany which were shut down. Their arms were dismantled and 
transported to Belgium. 
  The deal involves a total of four batteries in Zonhoven and 
one battery in Lombardsijde. Each battery is equipped with 
three launching mounts and with tracking and detection radars. 
They include some 300 short- and medium-range missiles. When 
the Belgian army purchased the equipment in the sixties, it had 
paid several billions of francs for it. Throughout the years, 
the equipment was gradually automated. 
  The news about the Turkish interest in Belgian Army 
equipment 
was circulating at last weekend's International Kurdish 
Conference in Brussels. In the corridors, participants said it 
was an outrage that Belgium is selling equipment to a country 
which is fighting a civil war with the Kurds -- even though 
Turkey is a member of NATO. 
<H5>  Arms law </H5>
  One might, indeed, wonder whether the arms sale to Turkey 
can 
be reconciled with the letter and spirit of the new Belgian arms 
law. The law -- a consequence of the painful arms crisis which 
toppled the Martens VIII government in 1991 -- has been in force 
since April 1993. Article 4 lists the criteria by which an 
export permit can be refused. Such a refusal is possible if the 
export "is seriously contrary to Belgium's external interests or 
to the international goals pursued by Belgium, especially if it 
would contribute to a manifest violation of human rights." 
  So far, there is no problem, since the Hawk missiles can 
only 
be used to shoot down airplanes. The Kurds -- with whom the 
Turks are fighting a bitter war -- have no airplanes. 
  Things change when one looks at the section in Article 4 
which states that arms exports are forbidden if "the country of 
destination is faced with heavy internal tensions which might 
lead to an armed conflict (or if the country) is involved in a 
civil war...." This is definitely the case in Turkey. 
  In 1992, there was already a lot of fuss about the selling 
of 
AIFV armored vehicles from Cockerill Mechanics Industries to 
Turkey. The arms law was not in force then. Later, Kurdish 
spokesmen claimed that the AIFV's were used as mobile police 
stations. At present, they are reportedly used to encircle 
villages, in anticipation of the Air Force's arrival. At the 
time, the European Community refused to impose an arms embargo 
on Turkey, in exchange for (idle) Turkish promises that human 
rights would be respected. 
  So the sale of Belgian arms to other countries continues to 
create a great deal of turmoil. Last week, several Flemish 
peace organizations protested against the planned sale of Mirage 
fighter planes to Chile. They are especially displeased fact 
that former Chilean dictator Pinochet still controls the South 
American country's army. 
  Yesterday, AGALEV (Green Party) demanded that the government 
be accountable to parliament for the Army selling weapons on its 
own, or for authorizing arms exports in general. The Greens 
endorsed the peace movement's protest. "Safe transactions are 
impossible," they argue, "because the arms can be easily misused 
in internal or regional conflicts." 
  "No one knows the Belgian arms' final destination after the 
official sale, or their potential side effects," AGALEV said in 
a statement.

<F P=106> [Video report by Thierry Belfroid] </F>
  [Text] Here now a report on the most secret company of 
Belgium's military units: the special reconnaissance teams 
[CSR]. It consists of 40 men specialized in military 
intelligence operations, and is based in Germany. Thierry 
Belfroid's report unveils the secrecy that surrounds the 
existence of these men, whose company will be disbanded in June. 
  [Begin Belfroid recording] If a major conflict had taken 
place, the Army's special reconaissance teams certainly would 
have played one of the most dangerous roles. Indeed, the 
four-person teams would have parachuted right into the middle 
of the enemy's positions for reconnaissance and sabotage 
missions, without any help from the outside and at distances 
exceeding 150 km from any allied base. That is why these 
volunteers over the past 30 years accepted the very difficult 
training regimen. The CSR have been trained for every possible 
situation and have engaged in the most physically demanding 
sports. 
  The members of the CSR company prepared for every possible 
scenario, making them seem like "Rambo men," although they do 
not like this expression. 
  After 30 years of hard and secret living, the CSR have never 
been used for a real mission. In June 1994, they will be 
disbanded. A page of Cold War history thus will be turned. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Jet Bruinsma and Jose Smits: "Lubbers Wants </F>
Debate on Asylum-Seekers -- Dankert Wants a Separate Treaty With 
Germany"] 
  [Text] During the weekend ministers received a letter from 
Prime Minister Lubbers asking them to think deeply about the 
increasing asylum-seeker numbers. The public discussion on the 
subject made that necessary, the prime minister said. 
  In his letter Lubbers also pointed to the large number of 
votes given to the Center Democrats and CP'86 in the municipal 
elections. 
  In his letter, which the cabinet will debate on Friday [18 
March], Lubbers did not propose any concrete measures to reduce 
the number of asylum-seekers. But Lubbers did ask a number of 
questions which, according to some people in the know, were 
"clear" and "very pertinent." Because the document had already 
been written, Lubbers did not refer to the comments by VVD 
[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] parliamentary leader 
Bolkestein on KRO [Catholic Radio and Television Broadcasting] 
television on Sunday evening. Bolkestein said that the 
Netherlands should only accept Europeans. 
  Lubbers asked his colleagues whether "we" knew for certain 
that everyone who asked for asylum in the Netherlands should 
actually be accepted. People without papers are accepted in the 
asylum process in the Netherlands, in contrast to some other 
European countries. They are accommodated as long as the 
procedure is ongoing. Lubbers asked his cabinet colleagues 
whether this was not a factor which made it more attractive for 
refugees to go to the Netherlands. 
  The prime minister indicated that a decreasing number of 
asylum-seekers are entering the Netherlands via Schiphol 
airport. But since the total number is nevertheless increasing 
strongly this year (55,000 are expected this year in comparison 
with around 35,000 last year), it is an obvious conclusion that 
they are coming overland, via Germany and Belgium. But then 
should not these asylum-seekers really have asked for asylum 
there, Lubbers wanted to know. After all, international 
agreements have been made on this subject. 
  In his letter the prime minister looked at the whole "chain" 
followed by asylum-seekers, namely acceptance, reception and 
accommodation. He expressed amazement about the fact that the 
government had made money available for 25,000 temporary homes, 
but that only four had been built. 
  During consultations between parliament and Foreign Affairs 
State Secretary Dankert on Wednesday it emerged that the cabinet 
is considering taking measures to reduce the number of 
asylum-seekers coming from Germany. At present 60 percent of 
asylum-seekers are entering the Netherlands from Germany. 
  Now that the so-called Schengen treaty is not taking effect 
(partly because of opposition from France), Dankert wanted to 
make a separate treaty with Germany about checks at its external 
border, for the benefit of the Netherlands. 
  The Schengen treaty included agreements between a number of 
European countries on tight checks on various matters, including 
the movement of foreigners at the external borders of the treaty 
area, in exchange for free movement at the internal borders. 
  The Netherlands has already made a "reciprocal agreement" 
with Germany. Under this treaty, foreigners who can be 
demonstrated to have stayed in Germany for a time can be sent 
back to Germany. They are taken by the military police to the 
Netherlands-German border. But it is not clear whether this 
labor intensive method is actually applied in every case. 
  The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] wants the cabinet to 
train additional military police officers and use them to expand 
checks at and behind the border, it emerged on Wednesday. These 
checks are also regarded necessary to fight the increasing 
smuggling of drugs, arms and illegal foreigners. 
  The PvdA [Labor Party] is mainly pushing for a European 
political settlement in order to distribute the number of 
asylum-seekers fairly across Europe. At present France accepts 
just as many asylum-seekers as the Netherlands, although in 
proportion to the number of its inhabitants it should do far 
more. 
  Germany's effort is comparable with that of the Netherlands. 
However, stricter asylum legislation there has led to a 
reduction, while the number of asylum-seekers in the Netherlands 
is increasing. 
  The cabinet also wants to free up the reception centers for 
asylum-seekers by making the application procedure quicker. 
Both the CDA and PvdA support the cabinet in this. The present 
procedure is too long and bureaucratic, according to the 
coalition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clinton's Public Relations </F>
Machine Is Working Overtime"] 
  [Text] The White House's "spin patrol" [last two words in 
English] had two busy days in Detroit. In this case "spinning" 
has nothing to do with purring contentedly before the open fire, 
but everything to do with a public relations (PR) machine which 
is overwhelming the press with one-sided information. In this 
case about the president's economic plans. 
  The occasion was the two day G-7 meeting on employment. At 
the invitation of President Clinton, the finance, trade and 
labor ministers from the seven richest countries had gone to 
"Motown" to meditate openly and behind closed doors about 
fighting unemployment. 
  This international setpiece was intended to distract 
attention from Clinton's problems in Washington. There he is 
being pursued by the call for more openness and hearings in the 
Whitewater affair. In Detroit and during other events in the 
country he could finally concentrate on his policies again. For 
a brief moment he was out of the snake pit. 
  To ensure that the media understood that too, Clinton's PR 
machine provided the exclamation points. The U.S. treasury 
secretary called Clinton's ideas "amazing." The commerce 
secretary said he found them "exciting." The top economic 
advisor spoke of "remarkable" plans. Vice President Al Gore 
called the conference "an important turning point in the postwar 
dialogue between the United States and other industrialized 
countries." 
  The rather less exuberant comment by the British 
representative that he had been to "other dull meetings like 
this one" could not temper U.S. enthusiasm. The message was 
intended for the U.S. public and not for foreigners who, after 
all, do not have votes. 
  But things went wrong. Clinton's speech on Monday [14 March] 
was to have sent out the signal to the masses that the President 
is keeping an eye on the interests of the average worker and 
unemployed person, despite healthy economic growth. On Monday 
morning that seemed to still be working, but the fun was spoiled 
a little later by Webster Hubbell. Hubbell is a friend of the 
Clintons and a former colleague of Hillary Clinton. On Monday 
he resigned as a highly placed member of staff at the justice 
department. Hubbell is suspected of charging excessively high, 
unjustified bills to his clients while working as a lawyer in 
Arkansas. 
  So Clinton's comments took a back seat. Once again the 
President was plagued by questions about his cabinet, scandals, 
ethics and the departure of his friends from Washington. A week 
earlier Bernard Nussbaum, the top lawyer in the White House and 
another friend of the Clintons, had resigned because of 
Whitewater. In the morning in Detroit Clinton was still proud of 
his policies, in the afternoon in Boston he was back at the 
beginning. 
  And what about the conference itself? The participants 
called it a success, of course. They would "take the comments 
with them" to the G-7 summit in Naples this summer. However, 
the ministers reached no conclusions and announced no moves. 
  In any case the participants have learned one thing. They 
have seen with their own eyes what happens in a city plagued by 
11 percent unemployment with virtually no social safety net. 
Their limousines, escorted by a noisy police escort, shot past 
boarded up houses along dilapidated streets. The Detroit-based 
car industry may have risen from its slump, but it is robots and 
cheap labor elsewhere which does the work.

<F P=106> [George Jones article: "Major in Trouble Whichever Way He </F>
Turns"] 
  [Text] War with Europe or civil war in the Conservative 
Party. That was the blunt choice facing Mr Major and the 
Government yesterday, according to one leading Tory Euro-sceptic. 
  Yet at Westminster there was an air of disbelief at the way 
a 
dispute over arcane procedures for voting in the EC's [European 
Commission] Council of Ministers had re-opened Conservative 
divisions on Europe and put Britain at odds with 10 other 
members of the Community. 
  Since the Maastricht Treaty became law last July -- after 
bringing the Government to the brink of defeat -- there had been 
an uneasy truce between the pro and anti-European wings of the 
Conservative Party. 
  Attention had switched to the delicate task of drafting a 
Tory manifesto on which Mr William Cash -- the arch Euro-sceptic 
-- and Mr Hugh Dykes, a staunch federalist -- could campaign 
with some unity in the elections to the European Parliament on 
June 9. 
  But the ferment among Conservative MPs over the past 48 
hours 
is proof that the party's fault lines over Europe are as active 
as ever below the surface. 
  Many regard the question of voting rights as a key test of 
whether or not the Government would stand by assurances that the 
Maastricht Treaty represented the limit of further transfer of 
sovereignty to Brussels -- at least until the next 
inter-government conference on the future of the Community in 
1996. 
  "Maastricht was supposed to be the high-water mark," said 
one 
Euro-sceptic. Another accused the EC of deliberately seeking to 
water down Britain's ability to block controversial European 
legislation on the environment and health and safety issues -- 
which could result in measures in the Social Chapter being 
forced through piecemeal. 
  There is little doubt that the disquiet goes far wider than 
the usual hard-core of 30 or so determined Euro-rebels. A 
number of mainstream Tories, who would normally opt for a quiet 
life, have signalled their opposition to any cave-in to 
Brussels. They believe the only hope the Conservatives have of 
bringing their supporters out in the Euro-elections is to tap 
public concern about the way the EC interferes in national life. 
One of the few issues on which the Tories still lead Labour in 
the opinion polls is on standing up for Britain against 
Brussels. That is a trump card which could lose its potency if 
the party was plunged into an acrimonious internal dispute over 
weakening Britain's voting strength in the Community. 
  Yet the dispute puts at risk what Mr Major has regarded as 
one of the crowning achievements of British diplomacy 
post-Maastricht -- enlargement of the Community. Further delay 
could sink plans for the admission early next year of Austria, 
Finland, Sweden and Norway. 
  On his return to London yesterday Mr Hurd said getting those 
four likeminded countries, which would be net contributors to 
the EC budget, would be a "huge prize." It seems inconceivable 
that Mr Hurd and Mr Major would risk derailing the enlargement 
process. 
  But the Government appears to be backed into a corner of its 
own making. Instead of preparing the ground for the change, 
arguing that it was a necessary price for the wider benefits of 
enlargement, which might help to curb the rising cost of British 
membership of the Community, it has turned it into the biggest 
confrontation with the EC since the Social Chapter. 
  The advice of British diplomats in Brussels, led by Sir John 
Kerr, Britain's ambassador to the EC, was that keeping the 
blocking minority at 23 was unattainable. It was, he said, a 
battle that should not be fought. 
  Yet Mr Major has decided to play to his domestic audience. 
Certainly, Conservative whips have told Ministers there is a 
strong groundswell of opinion among Tory MPs against making 
further concessions to Brussels. 
  Some MPs fear that Mr Major has stumbled into a Euro 
cul-de-sac without having an escape route planned. When the 
inevitable climb-down comes, with some inglorious Brussels fudge 
which would concede the central principle of a bigger blocking 
minority, the humiliation will be all the greater. It will be a 
damaging blow to the Prime Minister's authority and could reopen 
the Maastricht wounds in the Tory party. 
  Even now, the Foreign Office is working on possible 
compromises. The Community has been to the brink of disaster so 
many times before that most observers find it hard to believe 
that the crisis will NOT be averted. 
  But Mr Major may yet decide that a bust-up with the EC could 
pay electoral dividends for the Conservatives in the European 
elections -- though it seems unlikely he can delay a decision 
until after polling day on June 9. 
  For most of her 11 years in power Mrs Thatcher was in a 
permanent state of confrontation with the rest of the Community, 
swinging her "handbag" at fellow European leaders with gusto. 
But she usually knew when to stand and fight and when to beat a 
tactical retreat. 
  Mr Major's trouble is that few Ministers or MPs believe he 
has chosen an issue on which he can win -- or back down without 
inflicting further political damage on himself.

  [Text] Canada's defense minister says the break up of the 
Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War doesn't mean an end to 
all tensions in Europe, and he says Canada must take that fact 
into consideration as it reviews the role of the Canadian 
military in the coming years. 
  David Collenette points to last December's election victory 
by extreme nationalists in Russia as a potential threat to peace 
in the future. Canada's Liberal government has promised deep 
cuts in military spending, but Mr. Collenette says those 
promises were based on the belief that the world had entered a 
more peaceful era and that belief may no longer be valid.

<F P=106> [Interview with Employment Minister Michel Giraud by </F>
Delphine Girard; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Girard] Faced with the degree of discontent, should 
the government not abandon the CIP [Youth Vocational Training 
Contract]? 
  [Giraud] Following wide consultations with the social 
partners, the prime minister has agreed to refine the initial 
proposal. The additional decree to be published at the end of 
the month will amend to two points which are being questioned by 
the public. On the one hand, the content of the vocational 
training will be specified. On the other, young graduates with 
a "bac plus two" degree [two years of higher education] or with 
an equivalent diploma may not receive less than the minimum 
wage. The government will not budge any further. 
  [Girard] The CNPF [National Council of French Employers] 
believes that changes to the 1937 decree on working hours will 
have dramatic consequences for industry. Are you going to take 
this into account? 
  [Giraud] At the moment, everybody is trying to retain their 
own benefits. But we are not closing the door to discussions. 
The government has decided to extend by one month, or longer, 
consultations with the social partners on the new decree. Of 
course, the final text must be compatible with existing labor 
organization in industry. But any conclusion is premature for 
the time being. 
  [Girard] What lessons do you draw from the Detroit summit on 
employment? 
  [Giraud] Even if there were no negotiations -- that was not 
the purpose of the meeting -- this summit did, for the first 
time, allow the world's seven most industrialized countries to 
exchange ideas on employment. It is now established that social 
and economic aspects are closely linked and that it is no longer 
possible to deal with economic problems without also tackling 
the social questions. 
  [Girard] Did the G-7 serve to establish points of 
convergence 
between the countries regarding the fight against unemployment? 
  [Giraud] Discussions showed that the governments share 
common 
convictions. First, certain solutions were rejected. Together, 
we have condemned a return to protectionism, a general and 
compulsory reduction in working hours, and a reduced rate of 
productivity. The countries agreed that growth is essential to 
create jobs and that we must pursue macroeconomic policies 
favoring a return to growth. But there was a consensus that 
growth alone will not be enough. 
  We did not draw up a single model to be applied to 
everybody. 
Each country has its own culture, its own customs, and its own 
methods of management and employment. We must not try to draw 
up a global plan to combat unemployment. 
  [Girard] But beyond this, you agreed on the avenues to be 
pursued? 
  [Giraud] We have identified four principal ways forward 
which 
are likely to promote jobs. The improvement of human resources 
through training is essential to job growth. Training which 
should not be aimed exclusively at the young but also at people 
throughout their working life. The cost of low-skilled labor is 
excessive, and this requires a reduction in the charges on low 
wages. 
  Some countries take the view that the solution to the 
recession is to pay some people very low wages, below the normal 
wages; that is not France's position. We must remember that 
the "minimum wage" in the United States is 4.25 dollars an hour, 
or 4,300 francs gross for 169 hours. The third point is a more 
flexible labor organization through part-time work and working 
hours determined on an annual instead of weekly basis. Finally, 
countries are calling for a more dynamic approach to the way we 
handle the problem of unemployment, by requiring companies or 
public authorities, whichever the case may be, to support a 
return to work. You will be aware that these points of 
convergence are also to be found in Jacques Delors' White Paper 
as adopted by the European Council. They are also to be found in 
the [French] five-year law on labor, employment, and vocational 
training. 
  [Girard] Has progress been made on the idea of including a 
social clause in trade agreements? 
  [Giraud] Two members of the French delegation intervened in 
defense of the social clause, Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery 
and myself. We were followed by the Italians, the Canadians, as 
well as the Greeks, who were present in their capacity as 
current holders of the European Union presidency. The other 
delegations did not intervene, but I have the feeling that the 
United States is not opposed to the idea. 
  The next step now is Marrakesh. [Foreign Trade and Industry 
Minister] Gerard Longuet will be the French Government's 
representative at the Marrakesh meeting, which will lead to the 
establishment of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). The 
social clause question will again be raised. I intend, as I did 
last year, to argue for this once again before the WTO general 
assembly in June. I believe that after having sought, in 
various circles, the backing of other countries on the principle 
of such a clause, it is now up to the WTO -- as a tripartite 
structure -- to precisely define the content and the procedures 
which will ensure the widest possible ratification and respect 
for such a clause. 
  I see five areas which constitute the hard core of human 
labor rights: free trade unions; prohibition of forced labor, 
that is slavery; child labor; working conditions for women; and 
prison labor.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery </F>
by Gerard Leclerc --live] 
  [Excerpts] [Leclerc] [passage omitted] We'll start with 
the summit of the seven industrialized countries on employment, 
the first of its kind. [passage omitted] 
  France has defended the idea of a social clause; in other 
words, commercial agreements should be made conditional on 
industrializing countries respecting a certain number of social 
rules to avoid social dumping. France has not received a great 
deal of support. Britain in particular does not want to hear of 
any such thing. 
  [Alphandery] Oh yes, we did get support. You know we are 
putting forward arguments to prevent unfair competition. 
[passage omitted] We found support. The Italians accepted these 
ideas, so did the Canadians. We made a trial run, I would say, 
and we shall repeat the same plea in Marrakesh in the framework 
of the GATT agreement. I hope the case will go in the right 
direction -- at the very least, human rights should be respected 
in international economic affairs. [passage omitted] 
  [Leclerc] A decisive factor for the domestic economy would 
be a lowering of interest rates. For the moment, since the Bank 
of France became independent, there has been practically no 
lowering -- (?0.6) percent. Aren't you a little disappointed? 
Couldn't more have been done? 
  [Alphandery] No. You know, you have to put all this in 
perspective. Interest rates have gone down a great deal in 
France in the past year. They have gone down by about 40 
percent for short-term rates. 
  [Leclerc] But they're not going down any more? 
  [Alphandery] No, no. They are continuing to go down. They 
went down -- the daily rates have gone down twice. So the 
downward movement has not been interrupted. So that's the first 
point. Then you mustn't forget that we have to take into 
account a stable monetary environment in Europe. What is very 
important if there is to be a lowering of rates, is that 
currencies and parities should be relatively stable in the 
European environment. Given this context I am quite hopeful 
that there will be new margins for maneuver in Europe as a whole 
in the next few months to bring down rates. Of course the Bank 
of France is independent. It is the bank that makes the 
decisions. I myself am quite optimistic about its abilities to 
continue to bring down interest rates tomorrow, or in the next 
few months. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report signed L.M.: "The Not-Really-Good News About the </F>
Budget Deficit"] 
  [Text] Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy clearly has the 
touch. Despite the recession, which has hit public finances 
hard, he is to announce some good news this morning in the 
Council of Ministers: Last year's budget deficit has not grown 
as much as expected. According to the final figures, it should 
total 315.7 billion French francs [Fr]. 
  At first glance, this is great news, since we have long 
expected 1993 to end up being an outright disaster -- with an 
unprecedented hole in government finances. A year and a half 
ago the Socialists predicted in the initial finance law that the 
deficit would be Fr165.4 billion. Then everything started going 
wrong. Set up by Edouard Balladur at the time of the 
transition, the Raynaud Commission -- which was given the task 
of assessing the legacy -- estimated last spring that the 
deficit could reach the catastrophic level of Fr320 to 360 
billion by the end of the year. 
  The government will therefore be able to use this as an 
example to bolster its argument that it has engaged in sound 
management: first because since spring -- and at the time of the 
corrected finance law -- it has done everything to limit the 
slide, setting itself the goal of not exceeding a deficit of 
Fr317 billion; and second because it even managed to do better 
than that during the implementation phase. This is proof that 
the flood has been contained and that the government is now on 
the way toward bringing the deficit down to around Fr300 billion 
by the end of 1994, as predicted. 
  In addition, it should manage to do this even more easily 
since, according to reliable sources, the government is said to 
have chalked up an even lower deficit in 1993 of around Fr300 to 
305 billion. However, it is said that the government has given 
this up and has taken certain expenditure into account for 1993 
(primarily capital appropriations) planned for 1994 and has 
allocated certain receipts planned for 1994 to 1993. This would 
have the twofold advantage of not contradicting the conclusions 
of the Raynaud report on the Socialist administration, as well 
as alleviating the 1994 budget. 
  Nevertheless, there is one cloud on the horizon. While the 
budget deficit is once again falling, government debt is 
skyrocketing. It will probably rise from Fr2.110 trillion at 
the end of 1992 to Fr2.470 billion at the end of 1993 (a little 
less than initially predicted) and to around Fr2.870 trillion by 
the end of 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy by Laurent </F>
Maudit; place and date not given: "Sarkozy: `No Clever Tricks 
in the 1993 Budget'" -- first paragraph is LIBERATION 
introduction] 
  [Text] The budget minister, who yesterday presented the 
1993 budget, denied having embellished the figures by tapping 
the privatization nest egg, and not taking into account tax 
breaks for businesse as well as the social security deficit. 
  [Maudit] Do you understand why people are finding it very 
difficult to understand this year's budget policy? 
  [Sarkozy] I understand their difficulties all the better 
given that this year we have broken some old habits. The budget 
ministers who came before me used to announce an estimated 
deficit, and subsequently published an operational deficit which 
bore no relation to the former. This year we are introducing a 
change which I am very proud of. Our 325.7 billion franc [Fr] 
deficit for 1993 is even Fr1.9 billion less than the estimated 
amount. 
  [Maudit] A shrewd reply which, however, leaves the question 
unanswered. Is this drop in the deficit not in fact explained 
by certain clever tricks in the presentation of the figures? 
  [Sarkozy] What tricks? The reduction in the deficit depends 
on the development of both expenditure and income. Overall 
expenditure is only Fr7.2 billion higher than the initial 
estimate -- which proves that expenditure limits have been 
scrupulously complied with. On the other hand, income has 
surpassed our estimates by Fr9.2 billion. 
  [Maudit] Does this confirm that recovery is under way? 
  [Sarkozy] Precisely, given that this income surplus is 
essentially due to a rise in VAT [value-added tax] receipts, 
which increased toward the end of the year. This is the best 
indicator of a recovery in economic activity. The government is 
thus harvesting the first results of its policy. 
  [Maudit] The deficit is dropping, but the debt is soaring... 
Do you believe, therefore, that indebtedness is not the only 
trustworthy indicator? 
  [Sarkozy] You are talking like a theologian. I am a 
pragmatist. Both indicators are equally important, because 
today's deficit is in fact tomorrow's debt, and today's debt 
consists of yesterday's deficits. It is therefore perfectly 
true that the state's debt has increased by 38 percent over two 
years. However, 30 percent of this figure is explained by the 
increase in the deficit that we have inherited from our 
predecessors. The remaining 8 percent is explained by the fact 
that the social security debt has been taken over, and the fact 
that VAT reimbursements by installments have been abolished. 
  [Maudit] Are you not establishing a precedent by allowing 
the 
state to take over the social security debt? 
  [Sarkozy] You know very well that the social security debt 
existed before we came into office. Quite simply -- and you 
yourself denounced this old expedient in the past -- our 
predecessors conveniently left out the social security debt from 
the government's budget on 31 December, only to bring it back 
into the budget at a later stage. So, please do not accuse us 
of having concealed this debt! On the contrary, we have been 
truthful in disclosing its existence. 
  [Maudit] However, social security will continue to plunge 
into debt unless the state comes to its rescue. 
  [Sarkozy] I would like to remind you that the prime minister 
wishes to implement all the necessary reforms to prevent the 
social security gap from becoming increasingly wider. This is 
in fact the aim of pension reform, and of the initial measures 
on health insurance, which will be followed by other savings 
measures. I am therefore hoping that by taking over the social 
security debt, the state will be definitely settling the 
account. What is inadmissible, however, is to have allowed the 
social security deficit to deteriorate in the first place. That 
is the real scandal. 
  [Maudit] However, you have yourself authorized a few 
exceptions to budgetary orthodoxy -- for example, by financing 
current expenses with the income from privatization, something 
which Edouard Balladur always refused to do in 1986-1988. 
  [Sarkozy] The prime minister has entrusted me with a very 
simple task: establishing a budget which will help economic 
recovery as much as possible. The present context is radically 
different from the situation that you have just mentioned. In 
1986-1988, France was at the height of recovery, and it was 
therefore unnecessary to support business activity. At that 
time, it was normal to allocate the income from privatization to 
subsidizing public companies and to paying off the debt. In 
1993, we found the economy in a state of deep recession. I am 
therefore asking you: Can the same budget be planned for an 
expansion period as for a recession period? My answer is 
clearly "no." 
  [Maudit] When recovery begins, you will therefore stop using 
the state's assets to fill the gaps in the budget? 
  [Sarkozy] An exceptional situation requires exceptional 
measures. When we are again be able to rely on income from 
taxation, part of it will be used to reduce the deficit. As a 
matter of fact, we have committed ourselves to doing so with the 
five-year law which provides for a massive reduction in the 
deficit between now and 1997. I am not happy allocating 
two-thirds of receipts from income tax to reimbursing interests 
on debts in the 1994 budget. But I have no other choice. When 
you are faced with a Fr140-billion drop in receipts from 
taxation, you must still find some means of reviving the French 
economy. 
  [Maudit] You do not therefore share the view that the budget 
process is not open? 
  [Sarkozy] What I can tell you is that I am fully prepared to 
work toward greater openess. The first problem with the budget 
process is the fact that the most important debates take place 
at the forecast stage -- when nobody knows what will really 
happen. When it comes to implementing the budget, then there is 
no more debate. It would be advisable to change this. No 
doubt, a debate should take place in parliament when the budget 
is implemented, in order to draw up the balance sheet. But, 
believe me, if such a debate were to be held today, I would not 
be worried in the least.

  [Text] Lyon, France, March 17 (AFP) -- Some 5,000 students, 
protesting against plans to offer youngsters cut-price jobs, 
massed in France's second largest city Thursday [17 March], 
ahead of a major demonstration by trade unions also called to 
oppose the government scheme. 
  A further 10,000 students took to the streets in other 
cities 
across France, several hours before the official start of 
France's first unified trade union protest in more than 25 years. 
  In Paris, expected to see the biggest student-worker 
turnout, 
the protest is due to begin at 3:00 p.m. (1400 GMT). 
  For the first time since the student-worker riots of May 
1968, the country's trade union confederations have buried their 
differences and agreed to stage a joint march against Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur's scheme to let employers hire young 
people below the minimum wage. 
  The government, facing 11.3 percent unemployment, a post-war 
record, says the scheme aims to slash rocketing youth 
unemployment. One out of four French people under 25 years old 
in unemployed, which the French say is five times higher than in 
neighbouring Germany. 
  In southeastern Lyon, students waved banners saying "No to 
slavery" and "May 68 is not over." 
  Near the town of Montbeliard, also in the southeast, some 
2,500 students blocked the A-36 freeway between Beaune and 
Mulhouse. In eastern France, some 1,500 turned out in Belfort 
and 2,500 protested near Vesoul. 
  In the south, several hundred students blocked access to the 
city of Toulon while protests of about 1,000 youngsters were 
rrported in Montpellier, Nimes and Avignon. 
  Trade unions in most cities have called later in the day for 
a "day of decentralised action" against Balladur's Job Access 
Contract (CIP). 
  The demonstrations will be the fourth challenge by the 
unions 
to government policy in less than a fortnight and come at a bad 
time for the prime minister, facing his first test of electoral 
support in nearlky a year at the helm in local elections next 
Sunday. 
  Thursday's protests are backed by the communist-led CGT 
[General Confederation of Labor], the socialist CFDT [French 
Democratic Confederation of Labor], the moderate Force Ouvriere, 
the Christian-inspired CFTC [French Confederation of Christian 
Labor], the student UNEF [National Union of French Students] 
movement, the teachers' unions FSU and FEN [Normal Schools 
Federation] and the FCPE a parents' association. 
  The row over the CIP erupted in February when Balladur gave 
employers the green light to hire students leaving higher 
education at as little as 80 percent of the minimum wage of 
5,900 francs (roughly 1,000 dollars) a month.

  [Text] Paris, March 17 (AFP) -- Police Thursday [17 March] 
detained some 200 people involved in sporadic violence during an 
antigovernment protest, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said. 
  Pasqua said that in Paris the protest drew up to 35,000 
people, two-thirds of them students and the rest union 
supporters. Union leaders had put the total at 50,000. 
  In other French cities and towns, between 180,000 and 
200,000 
people took part in protests, Pasqua said. 
  The demonstrations were called to denounce a government plan 
to fight unemployment by letting businesses pay young people 
less than the minimum wage. 
  In Paris, demonstrators burned about a dozen cars and threw 
stones at police and occasionally at union leaders.

<F P=106> [Article by Valerie Devillechabrolle: "Nearly Half of French </F>
Work Force Said To Be in Situation of `Economic and Social 
Fragility'"] 
  [Text] Nearly half the French work force today is living 
under the threat of exclusion stemming from a "process of social 
disqualification." Here are some of the astonishing results, 
made public on Thursday 24 February, of the investigation 
conducted by the Center for the Study of Income and Costs 
(CERC)[.sup]1[/]. For instance, according to the study--which 
took as its starting point a 1986 INSEE [National Institute of 
Statistics and Economic Studies] investigation of "disadvantaged 
conditions"--some 11.7 million people, or 46.9 percent of the 25 
million people in the work force between the ages of 18 and 64 
are currently, to one degree or another, in a situation of 
"economic and social fragility." 
  Nearly 7 million of them have steady jobs, but as authors of 
the study point out, "they are vulnerable by reason of their 
income level or their tenuous integration into society." This 
marginal population, according to the researchers, is "above all 
unprepared to cope with job loss." Another 5 million people are 
already occupationally threatened--some finding it difficult to 
break into the job market, others simply unemployed. Within the 
latter category, 1.8 million people are gradually being pushed 
out of the job market, while 1.3 million others--people who have 
been out of work for more than 2 years--have dropped out 
altogether. Within that group is a yet more disadvantaged 
subset: 850,000 of the long-term unemployed are in danger of 
being cut off from their last links with society. Finally, 
according to authors of the report, "there are an estimated 
250,000 persons classifiable as `desocialized'"--in other words, 
1 percent of the work force, or 16-20 percent of those covered 
by minimum wage protection. 
  The face of exclusion seems more heterogenous and inconstant 
than ever before. People are being dragged down into poverty in 
a web of circumstances which the researchers say "can push 
marginalized people step by step into the sphere of occupational 
inactivity and welfare." For persons coming from strata of 
society untouched by poverty, i.e. people who have regular 
incomes and a certain amount of social and cultural capital, the 
study shows that "problems begin either with difficulties 
getting or keeping a job, or with emotional and relationship 
problems." Investigators noted among other things that "the more 
degraded the individual's employment status, the more difficult 
it is, especially for men, to form couples." Indeed, couples 
with employment problems run a higher risk of ending up divorced 
or separated. 
<H5>  Occupationally Threatened </H5>
  "The precariousness of their employment status and family 
disintegration have a strong effect on income and living 
conditions," the investigators say. Indeed, 40 percent of those 
who have been unemployed longer than 2 years live in households 
where income per person is less than F2,700 per month. "Finally, 
their precarious employment status is accompanied by a 
significant decline in sociability," especially among males and 
persons aged 35-50. In all, "32 percent of the work force can be 
considered socially vulnerable." The figure is only 25 percent 
for persons with steady employment but 50 percent for those 
already jobless for longer than 2 years. 
  In that context, it can be observed in all the principal 
countries of western Europe that "the social welfare machinery, 
originally designed to help people cope with persistent 
problems, has proven poorly suited to arrest a gradual process 
of drift toward social disqualification," the authors say, even 
though some Fr180 billion is disbursed each year to 12-13 
million people who otherwise would sink into poverty. For 7.5 
million of them, income per household member is somewhere 
between the minimum wage for a single person (Fr2,300) and the 
minimum old age pension for a single person (Fr3,030). Incomes 
for the other 5 million range between 1 and 1.3 times the 
minimum old age pension. The future success of policies which 
were implemented over time in an effort to prevent 
exclusion--and which were intended, like the minimum wage, to 
bridge the gap between guaranteed minimum incomes and actual 
wages--threatens to become "increasingly uncertain." 
  Indeed, according to authors of the CERC report, everything 
will hinge first of all on "the authorities' ability to 
articulate a genuine job policy in concertation with business, 
labor and management, and all the players involved in vocational 
training and occupational insertion." Prevention of exclusion 
also demands efforts to reduce academic failure, as well as 
"affirmation of fundamental rights" such as access to housing, 
medical care, a normal family life, and at least a minimum 
amount of personal possessions.

  [Text] The National Statistics Institute (INSEE) yesterday 
slightly increased its short-term growth forecasts in France, 
but stuck to its projection for unemployment--which it expects 
to continue to rise in the first half of this year--and for 
inflation, which is expects to slow further. 
  According to the new forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) 
should rise by an average of 0.7 percent over the six months 
from January to June, whereas, in December, INSEE was predicting 
growth of just 0.5 percent. If activity continues to progress 
at the same rate of 0.7 percent in the second half of the year, 
GDP would rise by 1.3 percent as a yearly average in 1994 over 
1993. This slight recovery would, however, be insufficient to 
prevent a rise in unemployment, which is expected to reach 12.7 
percent of the active population at the end of June, as opposed 
to 12.2 percent at the end of December. According to INSEE, the 
total number of jobs fell by 260,000 in 1993, a fall of 1.2 
percent after the fall of 1.1 percent in 1992. The fall 
included 215,000 salaried jobs cut in non-agricultural sectors 
(down by 1.5 percent). 
  INSEE noted that, in the second half of 1993, the number of 
stable jobs cut was similar to that for the first half (down by 
80,000), although the creation of insecure jobs rose slightly 
(up 15,000, as opposed to the cut of 60,000 in the first half). 
Overall, INSEE's revised its growth forecasts slightly upward 
because the increase in household consumption and foreign trade 
was more vigorous than expected. 
  Foreign trade, which initially was not expected to 
contribute 
to growth, rose by 0.1 percent on a six month average. Germany 
no longer acts as the engine of growth. According to the 
forecast, the fall in German activity recorded at the end of 
1993 should extend into the first half of 1994. Economic 
activity should be propped up by the United States and through a 
stabilization of European domestic demand, in particular thanks 
to the halt in the decline of investments. 
  French exports are up, especially to high-growth zones. 
Moreover, they are benefit from an improvement in the European 
economy. According to surveys of European employers, foreign 
demand among France's main trading partners (the United Kingdom, 
Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, and Spain) has risen above 
the average for the last 10 years. 
  INSEE expects French household consumption to rise by 0.4 
percent on a six month average, as opposed to the 0.3 percent 
predicted in December. Car purchases also outstripped 
December's forecast. The savings rate, after peaking at the 
start of 1993 at 13.8 percent, then fell continually to reach 
12.5 percent at the end of 1993. INSEE, however, expects that 
this rate will level off in the first half of 1994.

<F P=106> [Article: "Controversial Breeder Reactor Will Be Converted </F>
Into Radioactive Waste Incinerator"] 
  [Text] No fewer than three ministers--Gerard Longuet 
(Industry), Michel Barnier (Environment), and Francois Fillon 
(Research)--tried yesterday to justify the surprising decision 
Edouard Balladur made on Tuesday [22 February] regarding the 
future of Superphoenix (see yesterday's edition). "Superphoenix 
will no longer be operated as a nuclear power plant but will 
become a research and demonstration reactor." More precisely, 
one of the world's most controversial nuclear facilities (after 
Chernobyl and Kozloduy) will henceforth be used as a 
"sub-generator" for research on incineration of nuclear waste. 
  All the three of the ministers clamored to emphasize the 
provisional nature of the decision ("we will have the 
opportunity to reconsider it later on," they said again and 
again), a fact that is instructive on two counts. First, by 
converting Superphoenix into an incinerator, France is 
abandoning, after five years of wavering, a controversial field 
of research--electrical generation by breeder reactors, which 
produce more fuel than they consume--thus leaving Japan 
virtually the single proponent of the technology. Superphoenix 
was built to be a breeder reactor, and only that. Second, 
Edouard Balladur's team believes in the economic recovery it has 
been heralding. For the first time since the 1970s (the first 
oil shock), the French Government is committing itself to a 
major new research project, at the same time admitting it is 
"not in a position to say how much it will cost." There is talk 
it will amount to billions of [French] francs, and all for the 
sake of results which, at least according to independent nuclear 
experts, will be of little interest around the world. 
  There are no current industrial applications for 
Superphoenix 
as a "sub-generator." Assuming it operates at full power (which 
it has not done since 1988), a Superphoenix reactor can consume 
only 200 kilograms annually of the plutonium end product (a 
highly toxic waste) produced by ordinary nuclear reactors. 
France's 60 reactors create 11 tons a year of it. Thus if one 
were to use the incineration technique to solve today's nuclear 
waste problem, one would have to build 60 Superphoenixes. No one 
wants to do that; indeed, Parliament in 1991 prescribed a quite 
different nuclear waste disposal policy: burial. 
<H5>  Incineration </H5>
  The government believes however that an in-depth study of an 
alternative to burial would be useful. Michel Barnier explained 
that the Environment Ministry "was happy to see a research 
program on incineration of cumbersome nuclear wastes." The 
parliamentarian from Rhone-Alpes said nothing about his lack of 
enthusiasm for reactivating the breeder reactor. But he betrayed 
the same squeamishness as fellow Alps-region representative 
Bernard Bosson regarding the political sensitivity of the 
"Creys-Malville problem" in Ain. Among their colleagues, only 
Alain Carignon, another local deputy and member of the 
government, does not share their discreet repugnance; of course, 
his district is also reaping dividends from the reactor's 
presence. But Edouard Balladur's decision implies that the very 
small Alpine lobby carried very little weight against the 
massive nuclear industry lobby. Indeed, what Gerard Longuet and 
Francois Fillon said yesterday was largely derived from a 1993 
report submitted by Jean Teillac, former high commissioner for 
the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). 
  From a strictly technical perspective, Superphoenix posed a 
serious question for the government: Will there be any need for 
breeder reactor technology over the next two or three decades? 
The Creys-Malville reactor was designed in the 1970s to make 
France self-sufficient in nuclear fuel, at a time when the first 
oil crisis was bringing to an end the Thirty Glorious Years 
[i.e. after World War II]. Since then, the market for such fuel 
has taken a permanent nosedive, and enthusiasm for nuclear 
energy waned following the implosion at Three Mile Island 
(United States, 1979) and the explosion at Chernobyl (Ukraine, 
1986). Finally, from a technical standpoint, the Creys-Malville 
prototype has been nothing but trouble. The most recent debacle 
(July 1990) led to a "temporary" shutdown of the reactor. It has 
never been restarted. And as a result of various juridical 
maneuvers, it was deprived in July 1992 of its legal status, 
which only recently has been restored. 
<H5>  Opposition </H5>
  Superphoenix has served above all as a focal point for the 
never-held debate on the general directions of a French nuclear 
policy that has diverged from European norms. A debate first of 
all within France itself and in the countries on its borders; in 
traditionally antinuclear Italy, of course--although the 
country's scruples never prevented it from buying French 
electricity--but also in Switzerland. Geneva state counselor 
Claude Haegi said yesterday that if "the decision is ultimately 
made to restart it, Geneva would express its opposition." Most 
reactions yesterday were predictable. Localities near the power 
plants (and so dependent on them economically) expressed 
satisfaction. On the other hand, all the country's 
environmentalist movements (Greenpeace, the Europeans Against 
Superphoenix association, etc.) noisily expressed their 
indignation. The government is gambling that opponents will not 
be able to forge an effective coalition. 
  And there were two arguments that outweighed other 
considerations. For the government--obviously sensitive to the 
vulnerability of a nuclear industry that is as unhappy as its 
opponents are about Creys-Malville and what it has come to 
symbolize--it was simply unthinkable for Superphoenix to be shut 
down. In the final analysis, as the EDF [French Power Company] 
and CEA have constantly reaffirmed since 1989, the facility was 
indispensable to France's future--first for research into 
breeder reactor technology, subsequently for production of 
electricity, and finally, in 1994, for sub-generation. Secondly, 
NERSA, which operates Superphoenix, is owned 51 percent by the 
EDF, 33 percent by Italy's ENEL [National Electric Power Board], 
and 16 percent by Germany's RWE [Rhine-Westphalian Electric 
Works]. 
  Shutting down the reactor would require a reimbursement of 
the foreign partners who supplied some Fr50 billion of the money 
the reactor has already consumed. No one yesterday was able to 
provide a precise figure, but the partnership contract 
reportedly was crafted carefully enough that Fr18 billion of 
that money probably would have to be paid back. The government 
calculated that it would be less costly to complete the 
obligatory replacement of the current (breeder-reactor) core, 
followed by the second (isogenerating) core in 1998, so the 
facility in the end can be used for research. 
  Lastly, one thing is sure: Given all the legal and 
administrative hurdles ahead, the reactor is not likely to be 
back up to power before the first half of 1995. Very probably 
after the presidential elections.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F>
political correspondent Udi Segal "following the prime 
minister's meeting with Pope John Paul II" at the Vatican on 17 
March -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Segal] We asked Prime Minister Rabin about his 
meeting with Pope John Paul II and whether the pope intended to 
visit Israel in the coming weeks or months? 
  [Rabin] The pope said that he hoped to visit Israel soon. I 
do not know exactly what he meant by soon. At any rate, he did 
not mention any dates. 
  [Segal] What importance do you attach to your audience with 
the pope? 
  [Rabin] The pope is the religious and spiritual leader of 
hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Pope John 
Paul II decided to establish relations between the Vatican and 
Israel 45 years after the state's establishment. I thanked the 
pope for his courageous stand against totalitarian regimes, such 
as Nazism and Communism, and for his war against antisemitism. 
I asked him, as someone with influence over hundreds of 
millions of people, to support the Middle East peace process and 
to do his best to persuade elements in the Arab world to return 
to the negotiations. We obviously spoke about the need to put 
an end to the wars and the bloodshed which causes terrible 
suffering to all the parties, and especially to Israel. We 
spoke about those who had not returned from the battlefield and 
the soldiers who were still missing in action. I did not 
mention any names but I assume that there are continuing 
contacts between Israel and Vatican officials who may help 
locate Israeli MIA's. 
  [Segal] You are returning to Israel this evening. Did your 
visit to Washington contribute to the promotion or resumption of 
the negotiations with the Palestinians or the Syrians? 
  [Rabin] It is still too early to sum things up. There has 
been a delay in the negotiations. We discussed a series of 
steps, some of which have already been carried out and others 
which we shall implement in the future, as is the case with 
regard to the United States. This, in order to put the talks 
back on track as soon as possible. We cannot ignore the fact 
that the State of Israel, through the military government and 
the civil administration, is responsible for the security of the 
entire population. We have always been proud of this fact and 
stated it publicly. In the wake of what happened, we already 
took action and shall take additional steps in the future. 
  [Segal] When asked which steps he proposed to initiate, 
Prime Minister Rabin refused to elaborate, merely explaining 
that they would be on two levels, both guaranteeing the security 
of the Palestinians in the territories as well as enabling them 
to return to the negotiating table. 
  I asked Mr. Rabin if it was not time to defuse what he 
described as the time bomb in Hebron? The prime minister 
replied that he would not dismantle the Jewish settlement in 
Hebron because that would constitute a violation of the Oslo 
agreement. Rabin, nevertheless, used very sharp words when he 
described the Jewish settlement in the heart of the Arab town as 
stupid. 
  [Rabin] I do not want to link the issue of the Jewish 
settlers remaining in Hebron to other matters. As prime 
minister at the time, I prevented settlement activity there 
because I knew what the results would be. From the security 
aspect, the Jewish settlement in Hebron was established in what 
I would describe as a stupid manner. The settlements are not 
concentrated but rather spread throughout Hebron. Whoever did 
things that way was endangering the lives of the Jewish 
residents. 
  [Segal] In the interview, Rabin also hinted at the 
possibility of restrictions on settlers carrying weapons in Arab 
population centers, including Hebron.

  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, visiting Rome, 
has expressed his willingness in principle to withdraw Israeli 
troops from the Golan Heights within a global framework of 
security and guarantees for the Jewish state. Earlier Rabin was 
received by John Paul II and had met Prime Minister Carlo 
Azeglio Ciampi. 
  Commenting on his meeting with the Pope, Rabin stressed that 
he had not asked the Vatican to take any diplomatic initiatives. 
He added, however, that the Holy See would exert moral pressure 
for the resumption of peace talks.

  [Text] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin asked Pope John 
Paul II's support today to get the Middle East peace process 
back on track and he pledged every effort to bring peace to the 
Holy Land. 
  In a 30-minute papal audience requested by the Israeli 
leader, Mr. Rabin defined as shameful the Hebron mosque massacre. 
  The Vatican encounter was the first by an Israeli prime 
minister since an agreement to forge diplomatic ties was signed 
in December last year. 
  Vatican officials said Mr. Rabin renewed his invitation to 
the Pope to visit Israel and that the Pontiff accepted saying he 
hoped circumstances would allow a pilgrimage to the Holy Land 
soon. 
  Mr. Rabin arrived in Rome today on his way from three days 
of 
talks in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Today's meeting in the Vatican came on the same day that the 
Holy See's Secretary for Relations with States, Monsignor 
Jean-Louis Tauran, met PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis. 
  Following his audience with the Pope, Mr. Rabin gave an 
exclusive interview to Vatican radio during which he spoke of 
the role of the Holy See in the Middle East Peace process: 
  [Begin Rabin recording, in English] In my meeting with His 
Holiness the Pope, I found that he is more than interested to be 
in a position to influence the peace process. He would like to 
see a continuation of the negotiations and he would like to see 
peace being achieved in the Middle East as he would like to see 
it all over the world. But especially, he would like to see 
peace in whatever is related to the Holy Land. I stressed the 
importance of reaching peace hopefully before the year 2000 to 
Christ [as heard]. [end recording] 
  That was Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in an 
exclusive 
interview with Vatican Radio's Celeste Martino.

<F P=106> [Report by A. Laso D'Lom and F. Cortes: "Borrell Asserts </F>
That `Users or Taxpayers' Should Pay for Investment Effort in 
Infrastructures"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- At its meeting yesterday the cabinet 
approved the Infrastructure Master Plan [PDI], which envisions a 
total investment of 18.753 trillion pesetas up to the year 2007, 
with an annual average of 1.250 trillion pesetas. Out of the 
total amount of investments, 13.173 trillion pesetas will come 
from the budget, while the remaining 5.580 trillion pesetas will 
be funded from nonbudget sources. That is, they will have to be 
paid "either by the users of the services, the autonomous 
administrations, or the taxpayers in general," Borrell asserted 
yesterday following the plan's approval by the government. 
  At the presentation of the PDI, Jose Borrell, minister of 
public works, transport, and the environment, said that a 
"rational" debate on how to finance infrastructure should now 
begin: [At issue is] whether the financing should come from 
taxpayers, as hitherto, or users of the projects carried out 
should contribute more, as is currently the case with the tolls 
on some highways. 
  Borrell asserted that neither he nor the government has a 
set 
position on whether or not user fees should be applied, and 
asked that the debate begun in this connection should not be 
"Manichaean," and that people should not seek to say that the 
Spanish people will pay twice for highways -- once as taxpayers 
and then as users. 
  The minister cited as an example the fact that maintaining 
the current highway network, with the new projects recently 
completed, will cost the administration 100 billion pesetas this 
year, and asked who should pay for them. 
<H5>  Charges </H5>
  The ministry has studied the introduction of user fees for 
infrastructure -- especially highways -- and even examined the 
amount which could be charged, this being an annual fee of 
around 5,000 pesetas per light vehicle and 10,000 pesetas for 
heavy vehicles. 
  However, since this kind of charge is not the responsibility 
of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport, and the Environment, 
Borrell asserted yesterday that it is the Ministry of the 
Economy and Finance which should promote this debate in Spanish 
society, as has been the case in other European countries. 
  Over 75 percent of the investment (around 14.2 trillion 
pesetas) will be earmarked for transport infrastructure. 
Specifically, 10.7 trillion pesetas will be for regional areas, 
while another 3.4 trillion pesetas will be allocated for urban 
areas. 
  Investment in water projects will exceed 2.2 trillion 
pesetas 
(12 percent of the total), while 9 percent (1.8 trillion 
pesetas) will be allocated to environmental infrastructure 
(water drainage and purification and waste management). Coastal 
projects will receive 0.5 trillion pesetas, which will be mainly 
devoted to improving and regenerating beaches. 
  An investment of 45 billion pesetas is planned for research 
and development in technologies related to transport and 
infrastructure. 
  "This," the ministry states, "is the first strategic 
planning 
conducted in Spain to affect the basic infrastructures as a 
whole." 
  The ministry also states that the PDI is characterized by 
being a master plan, and thus "outlines a coherent framework for 
action," and is conceived as "an instrument of dynamic and 
flexible planning, adaptable in time to society's economic and 
technological evolution." 
  As far as intercity roads are concerned, the 5.4 trillion 
pesetas earmarked make them the most important part of the PDI. 
  The section devoted to high-volume roads includes the 
construction of 5,300 km of new freeways and expressways, and 
1,400 km of link roads. The construction of a turnpike between 
Madrid and Tudela is also proposed. 
<H5>  Railroads </H5>
  In the case of railroads, the PDI envisages an investment of 
3.2 trillion pesetas, aimed at improving the layout and 
extending the busiest routes. Suburban services will be 
boosted, and part of the investment will be devoted to 
preserving over 3,000 km of track. 
  The plan also consolidates a high-speed network through the 
Madrid-Barcelona-Frontera lines, the so-called Basque "Y," the 
Navarre corridor, and a new Madrid-Albacete-Valencia line. 
  Some 0.8 trillion pesetas and 1 trillion pesetas are 
earmarked for ports and airports respectively, aimed at 
optimizing the functioning of the port and airport systems and 
carrying out projects such as the enlargement of Madrid's 
Barajas Airport. 
  Another 3.3 trillion pesetas will be devoted to resolving 
transport problems in 18 metropolitan areas and in medium-sized 
and small cities. 
<H5>  Water Projects </H5>
  The PDI includes a section whose aim is to increase water 
resources, including water conservation and recycling programs. 
The planned projects include increasing regulating capability 
within each basin, interbasin transfers, and seawater 
desalination. 
  Some 0.3 trillion pesetas will be earmarked for improving 
and 
regenerating beaches.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan-Anders Ekstrom: "Hard-Pressed Salolainen </F>
`Pounds on the Table'"] 
  [Excerpts] Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen, the 
chairman of the National Coalition (Conservative) Party, thinks 
he won the support of the rest of the party leadership in a new 
attempt to restore order in the party. Following a fresh 
outbreak of criticism against him, he secretly summoned the 
group of ministers, the party leadership, and the leaders of the 
party's parliamentary group to a meeting a few days ago at which 
he says agreement was reached both on the party's goals during 
the remainder of this election period and on ending the "clever 
tactical maneuvering" on personal issues. 
  At an impromptu news conference Friday [18 February] at the 
parliamentary building he stated frankly that he had now 
"pounded his fist on the table," as he had promised to do 
earlier. That this quite literally happened was attested to by 
parliamentary group vice chairman Kimmo Sasi, among others. 
[passage omitted] 
  He also related that party vice chairman Maija Perho-Santala 
apologized for statements she had made, including those in an 
interview with the principal Social Democratic newspaper, 
DEMARI. In it she described Salolainen as "extremely 
hypersensitive" and implied that an extra party congress might 
be called for. 
<H5>  Caustic Opinions </H5>
  Salolainen did not mince words in his opinion of 
Perho-Santala, among others. He declared that he was "very 
displeased" by the disloyalty she had exhibited and pointed to 
the loyalty he himself had shown presidential candidate Raimo 
Ilaskivi as a model for others. [passage omitted] 
  Clearly annoyed, Salolainen further noted that it is very 
difficult to lead a party in the current economic situation. 
Here he compared his own situation with Prime Minister Esko 
Aho's position as chairman of the Center Party. It is well known 
that he too has come under pressure from Paavo Vayrynen, among 
others. 
  "We are both better than our reputations, but envy and 
shrewd 
calculation makes people behave strangely," Salolainen said. 
  He went on to say that Aho is by far the best conceivable 
person for the Center Party chairmanship. He also said he 
sympathized with former Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman 
Pertti Paasio. He referred warningly to the consequences that 
ensued when the SDP decided to remove capable Paasio. The Social 
Democrats are already coping with their third party chairman in 
a short period of time. 
  Finally, he also accused "old journalist colleagues" of 
conducting a campaign against him out of envy. 
<H5>  Some Understanding </H5>
  Despite the broadside against his critics, Salolainen also 
indicated some understanding of the dissatisfaction that exists. 
He conceded that he has recently been forced to devote quite a 
lot of energy to the European Union (EU) negotiations, but 
promised to begin devoting himself to preparations for the 
parliamentary election as soon as the EU negotiations have 
ended. Then the emphasis will be in the party sphere. 
  In view of the time that remains in the election period, the 
party leadership has already defined its goals. Salolainen 
declined to talk more about that yet. Proposals and demands will 
be presented in good order later. 
  It remains to be seen if order has now really been restored 
in the National Coalition Party. The party's parliamentary 
representatives seem to expect that there will continue to be 
internal dissatisfaction with the party chairman. [passage

<F P=106> [Finnish Press Agency (FNB) report: "Sasi: Coalition Party </F>
Needs To Debate Issues"] 
  [Text] Kimmo Sasi, vice chairman of the National Coalition 
(Conservative) Party's parliamentary group, is calling for a 
party debate on issues instead of personal matters. It is a 
disturbing sign, according to Sasi, that the new ideas are 
originating outside the party. 
  On Saturday [19 February] Sasi called for an internal party 
debate on values and the future of the kind that has been 
started by the young Finns under the leadership of Dr. Risto E. 
J. Penttila, who in fact also belongs to the Coalition Party. 
  Speaker Riitta Uosukainen (Coalition Party) warned Saturday 
against damaging the working possibilities for "a unified 
Coalition Party that does real work" and demanded that the party 
gather its strength for the election effort next year. 
  A debate on the state of the party has flared up in the 
Coalition Party, and there has been criticism of party chairman 
Pertti Salolainen in particular.

<F P=106> [Lars-Olof Streng report: "EU Membership Will Not Change the </F>
Defense of Finland"] 
  [Text] "Finland's possible membership in the European Union 
does not call for any change in our defense policy. This is 
simply because the EU has a military arm called the WEU [Western 
European Union]. If we become a member of this organization, 
then there will be military changes only." 
  This statement was made by Lt. Gen. Gustav Haegglund, future 
commander in chief of the Finnish Armed Forces. He was promoted 
to the post of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces by 
President of the Republic Martti Ahtisaari during Friday's 
presidential presentation. His mandate will run from 1 
November, when Admiral Jan Klenberg, the current commander in 
chief, is due to retire. Haegglund will be promoted to the rank 
of general on the same day. 
  In Haegglund's view, however, membership in the EU does have 
a political significance, as we will then be committed to the 
EU's common foreign and security policy. This can also be 
expanded to encompass defense policy, even a common defense 
system: "But that we do not yet know; that issue will be 
decided in 1996. And, as members of the EU, we will then 
participate in the decisionmaking and political process. But 
actual defense matters and their implementation are in the hands 
of the WEU. If we become members of the EU, we shall also be 
invited to become members of the WEU. 
  ``After that, things depend on the decisions we make, on 
whether we join as observers or members. If we go in as 
observers, there will no changes in defense policy. But if we 
become members, we will have obligations and guarantees: 
guarantees if we are attacked and obligations to help member 
countries if they are attacked.'' 
  If Finland becomes a member of the EU, it will be the first 
time any EU member state shares a border with Russia. Gustav 
Haegglund does not see this as a problem. Because the EU surely 
has no reason to start a war with Russia, Haegglund added with a 
broad smile. 
<H5>  They Have To Be Stationed Somewhere </H5>
  Russia is deploying an increasing number of troops close to 
the Finnish border. According to Lt. Gen. Haegglund it is 
important to note that they are not being deployed near Finland 
because of Finland itself, or in order to attack Finland, or 
even to fend off an attack from this country: "The reason is 
that hundreds of thousands of troops are being withdrawn from 
Europe, Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states. They have to be 
stationed somewhere. And there are barracks in the areas around 
St. Petersburg with the infrastructure for additional troops, 
barracks that can support them. 
  ``That is one of the reasons. The other is that, as they 
pull back from the Baltic area, they must also be able to defend 
that sector. I get the impressiion -- and I have some 
information from the Russians themselves -- that the major part 
of these troops is being stationed south of St. Petersburg. But 
some are also stationed north of the city.'' 
  Haegglund thinks it is important to make this statement 
while 
relations between the countries are as good and cordial as they 
are now and as long as the troops are controlled by the central 
administration in Moscow: "As long as order and control prevail 
among them, this can be a stabilizing factor in the face of 
rising crime. But if the situation changes, they are a 
potential threat. So we must hope that the situation stays as it 
is." 
<H5>  Military Background </H5>
  Edvin Birger Gustav Haegglund's background is truly 
military: 
His father, Johan Woldemar, was a lieutenant general, although 
he wanted Gustav to become a businessman. After graduating from 
Norsen [Swedish Normal Lyceum of Helsinki] in 1957, he joined 
the Army as a conscript at the age of 18 and, after summer 
service as second lieutenant at Dragsvik, he decided to follow 
in his father's footsteps. He graduated from the Military 
College in 1960 and completed his studies at the Military 
Academy in 1969-71. He also obtained a master's degree in 
political science in 1969 and studied in the United States from 
1972 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1982. 
  His career so far includes responsibilities as platoon 
leader 
and company commander in the Nyland Brigade; teacher at the 
Military College and the Military Academy; chief secretary of 
the Second and Third Parliamentary Defense Committees; commander 
on UN missions in the Middle East, Syria, and Lebanon; commander 
of the Nyland Brigade; commander of the Military District of 
South East Finland; and chief of the general staff since 1990. 
He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1988. Gustav 
Haegglund has been at the center of many a storm, but he has 
always pulled through honorably. In 1986 he was criticized by 
the then French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac for being on leave 
in his home country when a French UN soldier was killed in 
Lebanon. Haegglund interrupted his leave and the dispute was 
settled. He has been criticized for his views by both Defense 
Minister Elisabeth Rehn and Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio. 
Here too, he has managed to weather the storm. In Gustav 
Haegglund's view, the military also has the right to have an 
opinion.

<F P=106> [All names as heard] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] The Albanians in Oslo held a protest 
rally with the motto "Recognize the Republic of Kosova as a 
Sovereign and Neutral State." Our correspondent Antigona Qena 
reports: 
  [Qena] A grand protest rally attended by more than 2,000 
Albanians was held in the square of Oslo University, at the very 
center of the city. 
  Fatmir Zymberi, chairman of the Kosova Democratic Alliance 
[LDK] branch in Oslo, opened the rally. Pointing out that these 
are difficult times -- when the Academy of Sciences and the 
Albanological Intitute are being closed and the school buildings 
are kept occupied in the violently conquered Kosova -- among 
other things, Zyberi made an appeal to the Albanians not to 
think of themselves, but to raise their voice, wherever they 
are, about the free and sovereign Kosova. 
  A petition demanding the granting of nationhood to Kosova, 
banning the Serbian terror against the Albanian population in 
Kosova, demilitarizing Kosova, and placing it under an 
international protectorate was also read. From this rally, the 
petition was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
NATO, the president of the Norwegian Parliament, and the 
Norwegian prime minister and foreign minister. 
  Then well-wishers of the Albanian people greeted the rally. 
Professor Bergefuehre, who was in Kosova some time ago, 
addressed a harsh protest to the Norwegian Government to change 
its policy toward the Serbian Government and accept the 
nationhood of the Republic of Kosova to prevent a massacre that 
the spread of war could bring there. 
  Jon Brotnes, the Albanian honorary consul in Norway, 
reminded 
that Albanians are the most ancient people in the Balkans. They 
will win their sovereignty, with or without the Serbs' consent, 
because history is with them. 
  Parliamentarian Soldi Ksajli from the Christian Democratic 
Party greeted the protest. She has been to Kosova and, 
terrified by the situation she saw there, she appealed to the 
Norwegian Government for understanding and assistance. She 
promised that her own party will organize humanitarian aid in 
food and medications. 
  Erling Forplatz from the so-called Red Alliance Party 
supported the protest. He asked that the Norwegian Parliament 
exert pressure on the Serbian state to grant sovereignty and 
return freedom to impoverished Kosova, and together with Kosova, 
to the people who emigrated to the four ends of the Earth.

<F P=106> [Report by Hilde Harbo: "New Spanish Quota Demands Will Be </F>
Rejected"] 
  [Text] Brussels -- Norway does not have many fish to give. 
That is the clear position of the Norwegian Government before 
the negotiations with the EU today. 
  If Spain, in today's anticipated last and decisive round of 
talks, comes up with new quota demands over and above the total 
of 3,000 tonnes of cod to which Norway has agreed, then, 
according to the main Norwegian negotiators, the answer will be 
an unequivocal "no." 
  Norway will only start its negotiations late in the 
afternoon, after the Council of Ministers has discussed its 
institutional problems at the beginning of the meeting at 1300 
[1200 GMT] today. "We have no more resources to give," Foreign 
Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told journalists at a news conference 
yesterday. He rejected any talk of the "EEA [European Economic 
Area] quota" being stretched any further. Fisheries Minister 
Jan Henry T. Olsen also answered with a straight "no" when asked 
whether Norway will give up any more fish if the total permitted 
fishing quota increases further in the next few years. When 
asked how such an assurance by the Norwegians could be relied 
upon when the claim that Norway had "not one fish to give" had 
already become 3,000 tonnes, Godal replied: "We can discuss 
until we are blue in the face whether stretching the EEA 
agreement actually constitutes giving any fish. I call it 
adjusting or stretching the implementation of the EEA 
agreement," he said, referring to the fact that Spain will 
receive these quotas in 1995 rather than 1997. 
<H5>  Meeting With Solana </H5>
  Yesterday afternoon, Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen 
had a meeting with EU Fisheries Commissioner Yannis 
Paleokrassas. A meeting with the Portuguese fisheries minister 
was also planned for late yesterday evening. Meanwhile, the 
appointment which aroused the greatest excitement was the 
planned meeting between Foreign Minister Godal and his Spanish 
colleague Javier Solana. Godal and Solana met late yesterday 
evening in the Spanish ambassador's private residence in 
Brussels. Attempts were made to conceal the venue of the 
meeting from the press. When Godal emerged from the meeting 
after 75 minutes, he reported that Spain was not advancing 
fisheries demands in the usual manner but that the Spaniards 
felt they were being pressured within the EU. Godal emphasized 
that the meeting had taken place in a comfortable atmosphere. 
He presented his colleague with a cigar, but not a single fish. 
<H5>  Problem Areas </H5>
  In addition to the technical fisheries issue, which it is 
hoped will be solved at senior official government level this 
morning, there still remain four additional so-called "problem 
areas," namely the issues of resources, administration north of 
the 62nd parallel, market access, and licensing regulations 
associated with access to territorial waters. Olsen stated that 
yesterday's meetings did not result in any rapprochement between 
the parties concerned, other than on the question of market 
access. 
  "At the outset, Norway had accepted EU demands for a system 
to monitor imports of Norwegian herring, mackerel, shrimp, 
salmon, lobster, and scallops," Olsen said yesterday evening. 
It is still unclear, however, how long such a monitoring system 
will remain in place. 
  "The important thing is that the Norwegian fishing industry 
can continue like today, without being subjected to worse 
conditions," he added. The fisheries minister was extremely 
sober in describing the chances of resolving the remaining 
fisheries problems: "My feeling is that we have an arduous road 
ahead of us," he said. Olsen believed that the day's 
negotiations will decide whether Norway will arrive at a 
solution: "The EU wants to have us as a Member State, but it 
remains to be seen to what extent it will accept that Norway has 
some distinguishing characteristics which must be taken into 
account." He did not want to go into details regarding the 
solutions that Norway can accept on the matter of administering 
fish north of the 62nd parallel. "However, the decisive thing 
for me is that we get a regime under which we can feel safe in 
the knowledge that our system can continue as it is," he said. 
  In addition to fish matters, a formal statement on the 
whaling issue still has to be made, and the question surrounding 
a protocol establishing that Norway can continue its policy of 
openness in administration has yet to be addressed.

<F P=106> [Skjalg Fremo report: "Ban Adopted -- And Forgotten"] </F>
  [Text] Trondheim -- The amendment to the law was meant to 
prohibit Norwegians from acting as intermediaries for sales of 
arms and military equipment from one foreign country to another 
without special permission. 
  The amendment to the law was adopted by the Stortinget 
[Norwegian Parliament] in spring 1990 following rapid 
consideration. However, a formal error in its processing by the 
government meant that the ban first took effect last Friday [11 
March]. 
  The acting press spokesman for the Norwegian Department of 
Foreign Affairs (UD), Arthur Baste Knutsen, told us that the 
fact that the law has only just come into force had no practical 
meaning. 
  "Since the summer the law was adopted, there have not been 
any cases where this legal provision has come into play," Baste 
Knutsen said. 
<H5>  Slip in Minutes </H5>
  The statutory provision, which has not been in application 
for three and one-half years after all, is contained in the law 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. The Lovdata [legal data] organization 
discovered the formal error, which appears to have been made 
when the new provision was meant to be approved by the king at 
the cabinet meeting held on 22 June 1990. The law was indeed 
approved that day, and the intention was to implement it 
straight away. 
  However, this latter provision was omitted from the minutes 
of the cabinet meeting, probably by error. Consequently, the 
entry into force of the law was not announced in the NORWEGIAN 
LAW NEWS, Lovdata revealed in a letter to the Department of 
Foreign Affairs. 
<H5>  Arms Intermediaries </H5>
  The background to the amendment of the law was an actual 
case 
that came to light in the winter of 1990 when a Norwegian 
company acted as an intermediary selling arms from one country 
to another. The Justice Department discovered that the law in 
force at the time failed to give the Norwegian officials any 
authority to intervene against such activities -- because it was 
not a question of selling arms, but rather merely acting as an 
intermediary for arms sales. 
  Kjell Magne Bondevik, the foreign minister at the time, 
reacted quickly to close this loophole in a law dating from 1987 
governing the monitoring of exports of strategic products, 
services, and technology. Under the provisions of this law, 
Norwegian citizens must have a special approval to sell arms, 
while simple mediation was not affected. 
  The UD issued a proposal for an amendment to the law on 6 
April 1990. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet that same 
day, and the matter was passed on to the Stortinget. 
  The Norwegian parliament also reacted swiftly. The Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, led by [Prime Minister] Gro Harlem 
Brundtland, issued a unanimously adopted recommendation on 3 May 
1990. Odelstinget [larger division of Norwegian parliament] 
passed a unanimous resolution on 21 May 1990, and Lagtinget 
[smaller division of Norwegian parliament] confirmed this on 29 
May 1990. 
  Evidently, everyone agreed that the mediation of arms sales 
should be monitored. Accordingly, the amendment to the law 
should have been approved by the king in the cabinet. The bill 
states that: "This law shall take effect from a moment to be 
stipulated by the king." In a letter sent to the UD on 18 
February 1994, Lovdata pointed out that no decision had ever 
been made on its entry into force. Consequently, up until now 
it was lawful for Norwegian citizens to act as intermediaries in 
arms sales between one country and another, in direct 
contravention of Stortinget's 1990 resolution.

  [Text] The Norwegian Air Force wants to see the JAS-39 
Gripen multirole air defense and attack aircraft at an air 
display in Norway this summer and has sent a formal request to 
the Swedish Air Force to that effect, Lt. Col. Anders Eisen 
revealed. 
  "Before we can reply, the Air Force and the JAS consortium 
has to fix its next program of test flights," he said. "The 
only thing we can do at the moment is show the aircraft on the 
ground or in a simple fly-past." 
  The JAS received bad press when it crashed during an air 
show 
at the Water Festival last year. 
  According to Jan Ahlgren of Saab's Military Aircraft 
Division, Norway -- which will start replacing its U.S. F-5 
aircraft by the turn of the century -- is among the countries 
which have shown an interest in the JAS-39.

  [Text] Stockholm, March 18 (AFP) -- Sweden will hold a 
referendum on joining the European Union (EU) November 13, 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt announced Friday [18 March] 
after meeting with political party leaders. 
  "Finding a date that makes membership possible by January 1, 
1995 while giving all political parties a chance to campaign and 
spread information about the EU were the decisive factors in 
selecting the date," Bildt said. 
  "Despite the fact that a June referendum would have been the 
most direct and best alternative, I have taken into 
consideration the strong request by the Social Democrats and 
chosen a later date," he added. 
  The Social Democratic opposition had campaigned for a 
November referendum.

<F P=106> [Speech by Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis </F>
at a gathering organized by the Cyprus Studies Center at the 
Hellenic Culture Center in Nicosia--live; the speech is entitled 
"International and Regional Security Issues, Opportunities, and 
Dangers for Hellenism"] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Despite its instability and 
problems, the new world order being formulated offers huge 
opportunities for Hellenism if we can see far into the future. 
If we are united, have plans, vision and determination, and if 
we proceed, this can be a golden era for Hellenism, which has 
every capability to become an important regional economic force 
in the Balkans, Middle East, and eastern Mediterranean. In this 
era, Hellenism has the capability to play its historic role, 
because it is situated at the crossroads of the North, South, 
East, and West. We have the capability to shape the world's 
cultural trends and once more influence political developments 
with the particular nature, originality, and expertise of Greek 
civilization and its principles. Hellenism today has the 
capability to proceed with united and planned collective 
security in the region and to secure its own defense. Hellenism 
today is alone capable of securing its own defense and 
independence. [passage omitted] 
  The new world order has not yet shaped the form of 
collective 
security. We live in a transitional period, which will be long. 
It is very possible that our entire life will be spent in that 
transitional period. The new, balanced world system that will 
be born could come in time. We must accept that we live in an 
unstable and transitional period that is full of problems but 
also full of opportunities. It is very important to understand 
the dimensions of the world system being formulated so that we 
do not make the same mistakes we made in the past. We must 
understand the new dimensions so that we might make the right 
choices with planning and vision. [passage omitted] 
  There are three basic issues that should constitute the 
basis 
of Hellenism's national strategy. Seeing things beyond today's 
difficulties, I think the three axis are the following: First, 
Hellenism's clear and firm European orientation. Second, a 
strong economic policy by Greece and Cyprus for economic 
cooperation in the Balkans, Black Sea countries, eastern 
Mediterranean, and Africa. Third, and in parallel with the first 
two, is the formulation of a defense policy that will cover 
Hellenism's unified area. 
  The Cold War put Hellenism somewhere on the sidelines of 
European developments. This should change. Greece is today a 
firm member of the European Union, inside which it must fight 
for Greek issues. Greece's basic goal is and should be the 
immediate accession of Cyprus to the European Union. The 
Europeans should realize that Europe's border does not stop at 
Greece. Europe's border, its responsibility for collective 
security, ends at the independent Republic of Cyprus. Europe 
owes this to Hellenism because the Greek tradition forms its 
cultural and political base. But Europe also needs Greece and 
Cyprus' Hellenic element to compete with the other groups in the 
regions where Hellenism can be first, that is, the Balkans and 
Middle East. The fight may be hard. Greece was often isolated 
in the European Union while fighting the struggle for Cyprus. 
But we fight and we will win the struggle together, and in 1995 
the issue of Cyprus' accession to the united Europe will at last 
come up so that Hellenism will not be mutilated and divided. It 
will be as it should be--one part of the European civilization 
and idea. 
  The second issue we should follow is that of the great 
economic opportunities offered to Greece's region and to Greek 
business in small countries. There is another paradox: Whereas 
competition exists within big economic groups, new technology 
justifies the smaller countries operating within these groups. 
It benefits the versatile countries, the countries with 
business talents and those that can move quickly, to look into 
the future and take on the risks. We are reliving the economic 
opportunities that Hellenism had in the 18th and 19th centuries. 
It is Hellenism's golden opportunity to develop economic 
initiatives and cooperation throughout the Balkans and also in 
Eastern Europe, the Black Sea, the east Mediterranean, and North 
Africa. The move has already begun. Greek investment projects 
in Bulgaria are second only to Germany's. Significant openings 
have been made in Romania and further north, in Moldova. In 
addition, when the civil war in Yugoslavia ends, Greece will 
play a significant, dominant role in economic cooperation in the 
area. Closer to Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, following 
the moves between Israel and the Arab countries, Cypriot 
Hellenism is in a good position to utilize the new possibilities 
for cooperation that are available in the Middle East. [passage 
omitted] 
  Now I come to the third issue, defense. Nothing would be 
better for Hellenism than if we lived in a peaceful region, with 
no problem of security, and if we had general disarmament, 
because our civilization, our values, are based on the concepts 
of democracy, peace, and cooperation among free peoples. It is 
in this spirit that the president of the Republic of Cyprus was 
right, very right, to propose, in connection with the island's 
security, a general disarmament and the withdrawal of Turkish 
troops so that the people themselves may use other methods to 
solve their problems and live well. But this dream of peaceful 
coexistence remains a dream; the reality is different, a 
nightmare. Both Greece and Cyprus--two independent states but 
both Hellenic--make the correct appraisal that they face the 
common threat of Turkish expansionism. And, while we are 
building the future with optimism and economic cooperation with 
other peoples and the European Union, we have a duty to 
ourselves, a duty to our history, to protect Hellenism, to 
defend ourselves jointly. [passage omitted] 
  When two states judge that they face a common threat, the 
least they must do--and woe betide them if they do not--is to 
coordinate their defense plans so that their defense cooperation 
can confront the threat more effectively. Speaking in the 
Chamber of Deputies, Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
said that any further advance of Turkey in Cyprus would be a 
casus belli for Greece. As long as there is a threat, it 
follows that our defense plans must be coordinated. The unified 
defense area is an answer to this need. But I would like to 
stress: Greece also has an increased responsibility toward 
Cyprus. According to the Zurich Agreement, Greece is a guarantor 
power for Cyprus and can do nothing but, as a guarantor power, 
guarantee the independence of the independent state of Cyprus, 
which is part of Hellenism. [applause] 
  The defense doctrine is a clearly defensive concept. I 
repeat: Had there been no threat, had there been no illegal 
occupation of part of Cyprus by Turkish troops, who, despite the 
many UN resolutions have not withdrawn from Cyprus, had there 
been no forceful demographic change caused by the [Turkish] 
settlers, then the issue might have been different. But the 
threat exists and the defense doctrine, the unified defense 
area, is an attempt to restore the balance so that the feeling 
of security may be consolidated within Cypriot Hellenism in that 
Cyprus is not an open range, that all the Greeks [applause] are 
together with the Cypriots. In times of danger we are all 
Cypriots. [applause] 
  Serious work has already been done in the unified defense 
area, which was announced by Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou and Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis last 
November. The Cypriot defense minister's visit to Athens 
followed and we held discussions on a specific basis. Serious 
preparatory work has been carried out by leading members of the 
Greek and Cypriot military General Staffs and we are discussing 
the conclusions drawn by the military so that this week, I can 
say, will be a historic one for promoting Greek- Cypriot defense 
cooperation. Many decisions have been made and others will be 
made but they cannot all be announced. Defense has this 
peculiarity: You do things first and the people see them later. 
You talk less and do more. This is what we are doing this 
week. [applause] 
  The press has also reported various scenarios. We are 
imaginative people and we like mythology, which is, after all, a 
Greek product, but when we discuss national issues we should 
spare the rumormongering and mythology. Doubtless, the 
declaration of the unified defense doctrine disturbed many 
quarters. There are many who want Hellenism to be weak, who 
want to see Cyprus unable to negotiate its rights. Our answer 
to them is that our defense doctrine is defensive. We recall 
[Greek historian] Thucydides' words: The strong imposes on the 
weak what his strength allows and the weak retreats as much as 
his weakness forces him to retreat. I do not believe the 
negotiations for a Cyprus solution can be conducted under the 
current unequal terms of defense. The restoration of the 
balance we seek does not go against programs for negotiations 
and a Cyprus solution. On the contrary, it is a prerequisite 
for a correct and peaceful Cyprus solution. This is so because 
only when Cyprus has negotiating power, only when Cyprus has a 
trustworthy defense, with its inclusion in the unified defense 
area of Hellenism, only then can it go to the negotiating table 
with its claims, which have been unanimously passed in UN 
resolutions but have not been realized. We know we are in the 
right but we also know another thing: To find our right we must 
be united and strong. This means a unified defense area. 
[applause] 
  So the efforts are in parallel, not in discord. Efforts must 
be made to negotiate a viable Cyprus solution. I do not mean 
tactical moves that fail to touch upon the problem's 
substance--the illegal occupation by Turkish troops of the 
independent Cyprus. [applause] A viable Cyprus solution should 
start with and solve the question of the security and 
independence of a UN member state-- Cyprus. To strengthen and 
turn the negotiations in this direction, which is the only way 
to solve the issue, we create our defense prerequisites. This 
is primarily to discourage adventuring by some quarters, who, 
sensing a defense weakness, might attempt, and why not, to 
repeat something that was done in the past, in 1974. The 
message must be passed to the other countries that the issue of 
solving the Cyprus problem will be resolved on a basis in which 
Cyprus has a trustworthy defense. This is the framework and 
concept of the unified defense area. The first steps have been 
taken; we will proceed quickly to consolidate this doctrine. 
  Hellenism has only one heart. We strike with one heart. 
Greece and Cyprus have the same heart. There is no defense and 
security of Cyprus separate from the defense and security of 
Greece and there is no defense and security for Greece when 
Cyprus is in danger. We are together in this struggle for 
national survival, national vindication. We are together on a 
difficult, uphill path. But, as I said earlier, I look far, 
perhaps too far, to the horizon, where the future looks bright 
if we can overcome our national weaknesses. Our national 
strategy must be coordinated, planned, and united. We are faced 
with many domestic problems, which can divide us. We may 
quarrel. We are a people who like dialogue and dispute. We 
have many domestic issues that can divide the parties. But on 
national issues there must be unanimity, a national strategy for 
all Hellenism. This message is beginning to reach other 
countries. I felt really proud when foreign diplomats started 
to ask me about the unified defense area and what it means. 
They believed me, because they know that we are determined to 
go ahead. For the first time I saw that they are beginning to 
take us seriously. This way we will solve our issue. 
  I am not a daydreamer. I am one of many Greeks who believe 
in their tradition and who believe we have a bright future. 
Seeing this bright future beyond the difficulties, I see 
nothing in which Hellenism is inferior. We can realize this 
vision. To those who mistrust, those who doubt, I say: Why not 
this vision? Greece has achieved it often. We will achieve it 
this time too. We will win. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Glavkos Kliridhis, president of the Republic </F>
of Cyprus, by Frank Schlomer in Nicosia; date not given: 
"Without Us, The European Union Is Incomplete; 20 Years of 
Turkish Occupation on Cyprus"] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Schlomer] Talks between both 
communities have been resumed under UN auspices, but sometimes 
one can wonder whether this is really a dialogue. Is it not 
true that Rauf Denktash is playing some kind of game just to 
keep busy, rather than trying to come to a solution? 
  [Kliridhis] What is being discussed right now certainly is 
not the solution for the Cyprus problem, but could be called 
confidence-building measures. Such measures can only be a first 
step in restoring a favorable climate. We are conducting these 
negotiations at UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's request, and 
we consider it quite an improvement that the United Nations has 
sent a mediator and the European Union an observer here. 
  We are adhering to our final goal of a peaceful restoration 
of the country's unity. At this stage, the main purpose is to 
restore general confidence. This principle also was accepted by 
Denktash, after his elections (on 13 December 1993, editor). 
However, this does not mean that we will be ready very soon to 
sign agreements or even to lay down an agenda for possible 
future steps. 
  [Schlomer] One could, however, get the impression that Rauf 
Denktash is hiding behind all kinds of excuses so as not to make 
any progress at all. First, we had to wait for his elections, 
now he is waiting for the outcome of the Turkish municipal 
elections on 27 March. These elections might result in a 
political earthquake. 
  [Kliridhis] It is not inconceivable that Denktash is trying 
to buy time. I have known him for many years. I have had many 
discussions with him, and I can see through his tactics. The 
situation in Turkey clearly is deteriorating, and these 
municipal elections even might jeopardize the government 
coalition. In a way, these confidence-building measures were 
forced upon Denktash, and he does not like the idea. The Ciller 
government wants some kind of settlement for Cyprus, and 
therefore is exerting pressure on Denktash. The present 
dialogue could be one step in that process, but Denktash's 
position could change if a different coalition were formed in 
Ankara. Finally, he also wants to gain advantages that are not 
offered in the UN-proposed package, which is why he is 
maneuvering this way. I know these tactics. 
  [Schlomer] The UN package mainly provides for the reopening 
of Nicosia's International Airport, and for the restoration of 
access to Varosha, in both cases under UN control. Is Varosha 
such an important symbol to you? 
  [Kliridhis] Before the occupation, the seaside resort of 
Varosha in the east, near Famagusta, was a famous tourist center 
attracting Turkish, Greek, and foreign visitors. Now it is a 
desolate and dilapidated ghost town, cut off from the outside 
world by barbed wire. The telephone and electricity systems as 
well as streets and houses are destroyed, and it will take at 
least $2 billion to make the town inhabitable again. However, 
if the occupier would make the town freely accessible, some 
20,000 people could return to their homes. This cannot be 
achieved overnight, but Varosha could be made livable within 
five years. It is a symbol to the extent that the Cyprus problem 
would not be solved by the reopening of Varosha, but it at least 
would become a place where both communities could meet in peace. 
It could create a change of mentality, and the Turkish myth 
that we can no longer live together could be unmasked. Varosha 
could become some sort of a test case, a stepping stone toward 
future developments. The United Nations also would consider 
this a success because, believe me, they really are watching 
closely to see which party is taking an unreasonable position. 
  [Schlomer] Your policy's second objective is to join the 
European Union [EU]. Can you imagine a situation in which the 
Republic of Cyprus would be part of the EU while Turkey would 
still occupy the northern part of the country? 
  [Kliridhis] Listen, the international community wants a 
solution to the Cyprus conflict. The EU, which is sympathetic 
toward our accession, will reassess our membership request from 
1 January 1995 onward. Europe insists that a political solution 
be found for Cyprus by then. However, even if no solution is 
found, our membership request will still be reassessed. Anyway, 
since we cannot join the EU before 1996, many problems can still 
be solved by then. In the meantime, we continue to work and 
already have done much work on harmonizing our legislation with 
the laws prevailing in the EU. We are meeting practically all 
conditions for accession. 
  If we adopt a constructive attitude during the various 
talks, 
Europe can hardly penalize Cyprus by not admitting it, even if 
part of it would not be free. The European observer is 
reporting continuously to Brussels, and he is a firsthand 
witness to our positive attitude. That is why it is so 
important that the EU decided to send an observer. 
  [Schlomer] Allow me to play devil's advocate. One might say 
that Cyprus is a small, far-off island, situated somewhere near 
the Syrian and Israeli coastlines. Why on earth should this 
island join the EU? 
  [Kliridhis] The political parties on Cyprus, as anywhere 
else, have different views and argue about all sorts of issues. 
But there is absolute unanimity about one thing: Everyone 
wants to join the European Union, all political parties, the 
entire population. Including the communists, especially after 
the fall of the Eastern Bloc. Even the people from the 
northern, occupied part of Cyprus want to join the EU. I am 
quite sure of that. And this is not only true for businessmen, 
who expect economic benefits from the EU. 
  We have been part of Europe for several millenia, our 
European traditions are innumerable, so it is only natural that 
we should become a formal member state of the EU. Just ask 
anyone in the street whether or not he feels European. 
  In addition, our geographic position is interesting for the 
Union: we are at the crossroads between different continents, 
and the EU could play an important role in the region through 
Cyprus. Cyprus always has functioned as a bridge, and it could 
play this role even more efficiently as an EU member state. The 
EU without Cyprus is like an unfinished building. 
  [Schlomer] Do you not have the impression that the world has 
somewhat forgotten about Cyprus? Some countries who have UN 
Blue Helmets stationed here believe that 20 years is enough, and 
already have hinted that they may recall their peacekeepers. 
  [Kliridhis] As far as your last remark is concerned, it is 
true that some countries are recalling their blue helmets from 
Cyprus, but I do not see why this should be a major problem. 
Other countries already have offered to send peacekeeping 
forces to the demarcation line on Cyprus, such as Argentina, 
Hungary, Romania, and some former Soviet republics. The cost of 
the stationing should not be exaggerated, either: the operation 
costs $40 million a year, and Greece and Cyprus together pay 
half of that amount. By the way, I am a strong advocate of a 
continued presence of UN blue helmets on the island because they 
form an essential factor of our security. 
  As regards the world's attention to Cyprus, I believe it is 
slowly coming back. I perfectly understand that Europe has had 
other things on its mind in recent years: the fall of the 
communist regimes in East Europe, the new republics on the 
continent and in the former Soviet Union, and the terrible 
tragedy in the former Yugoslavia. I understand that all these 
issues pushed Cyprus somewhat into the background. The same 
goes for the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, which 
is presently taking place not so very far from here: the world's 
attention is focused on that problem rather than on ours. In 
addition, the situation on Cyprus is -- fortunately -- quiet. 
Attention also slackened a little because of that. 
  [Schlomer] But your Greek friends are presently presiding 
over the European Union. Can they not support Cyprus a little 
more? 
  [Kliridhis] Being president is often useful to determine an 
agenda, but a president cannot simply promote any issue it 
wants. Greece may be president, but it also is up to its neck in 
the all-embracing Balkans conflict, which has a certain 
paralyzing effect. Its dispute with The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia [FYROM] also is taking much of its energy. I 
talked to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou shortly before 
Greece became EU president, and I will meet with him again in 
mid-June on Rhodes; the United Nations currently is working very 
hard on the Cyprus issue; the European observer is keeping 
Cyprus in the spotlight in Brussels. So, Cyprus certainly is 
back on the world agenda.

  [Text] Polish National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk has arrived in Ankara on an official visit. He 
was received at Esenboga Airport by National Defense Minister 
Mehmet Golhan. 
  In a statement here, Golhan said that relations between 
Turkey and Poland have always been conducted with mutual 
confidence and friendship, even during the Cold War. He said 
Turkey appreciates Poland's efforts to join the Partnership for 
Peace process. Poland is an important country for European 
security, he said, and will make valuable contributions to this 
process. 
  In turn, the Polish defense minister said the warm welcome 
he 
received is a sign of the good relations between the two 
countries. He pointed out that President Suleyman Demirel's 
visit to Poland last November had a positive effect on the 
Polish people's attitude toward Turkey. He added that remarks 
made by President Demirel during the visit also expressed 
Poland's expectations with regard to NATO and European security.

  [Text] At the end of their interrogation at the Ankara 
State Security Alternate Court, five Democracy Party [DEP] 
deputies and one independent who were stripped of their immunity 
were arrested today. 
  Early this morning, the six deputies were taken from the 
Security Directorate to the Ankara State Security Court under 
heavy security. After their files were studied, two judges 
interrogated them. 
  Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral later said that Hatip Dicle, 
DEP leader and Diyarbakir deputy, did not make a statement at 
the Alternate Court, which subsequently ruled to arrest Hatip 
Dicle, DEP Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, DEP Sirnak Deputy Orhan 
Dogan, DEP Mus Deputy Sirri Sakik, DEP Mardin Deputy Ahmet Turk, 
and independent Sirnak Deputy Mahmut Alinak. 
  The prosecutor is demanding that the deputies be tried for 
violating Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code. The article in 
question envisages the death sentence for treason, and for 
crimes against the sovereignty and indivisible unity of the 
state, country, and nation.

  [Text] Ankara, March 17 (AFP) -- French Foreign Minister 
Alain Juppe said France would help Turkey affirm its "European 
identity," in talks here Thursday [17 March] with Turkish 
officials. 
  Juppe spoke with reporters after discussions with Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller and a private meeting with Foreign 
Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  Turkish Government sources said they discussed the Kurdish 
separatist rebellion in Turkey and the case of seven Kurdish 
deputies who were detained on charges of "separatist" activity 
last week after their parliamentary immunity was lifted. 
  The incident drew concern from several European countries, 
including France, who publicly urged the Turkish Government to 
respect legal guidelines in any action against the deputies. 
  Juppe told reporters that Turkey and France were guided by 
the "same choices," which he listed as "democracy, justice and 
respect for human rights," and stressed that he "hoped that the 
two countries can continue to share the same principles." 
  He made no public reference to the Kurdish deputies. 
  The French foreign minister also called Turkey, which is a 
member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, an "element of 
stability in a troubled region." 
  Turkish diplomatic sources said Juppe's discussions here 
would deal essentially with international subjects of common 
interest. 
  Juppe, who arrived Wednesday night on a two-day official 
visit, placed a wreath at the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, a 
national hero and the founder of modern Turkey. 
  He also met with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and was 
to head to Istanbul later Thursday for meeting with Turkish and 
French businessmen.

<F P=106> ["Text" of message from PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, read to </F>
the 12-13 March international conference on North Kurdistan in 
Brussels by Kani Yilmaz, representative of ERNK, National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan in Europe--all quotation marks as 
published] 
  [Text] "The Kurdish problem, which has gradually become 
internationalized and attained a level eliciting the world's 
close concern, and in particular the problem of northern 
Kurdistan has reached the solution phase owing to the 
development it has achieved. Before reaching this stage, our 
people, led by our party, achieved its national awakening and, 
to attain freedom, it furthered its national liberation war on a 
fully legal basis at the cost of enormous suffering and 
sacrifice in northern Kurdistan. 
  The Turkish state's approach has always been one of denial 
[of Kurdish existence] and justification of this denial by 
disregarding the historical facts. Any stance against this 
approach by the Turkish Republic has been rather brutally and 
cruelly suppressed. Our people's demand for freedom has been 
choked in blood. 
  Despite the world's close interest in the Kurdish problem, 
the position of certain European states has made solving it 
difficult rather than easy. The support given has been such as 
to encourage the Turkish Republic in its massacres in this 
unjust war against our people. 
  In addition, these states, motivated by their economic and 
political interests and an incomprehensible mentality, have 
branded our party, which has the support of millions and is the 
real partner in a solution, a "terrorist" movement. Again, the 
unfounded statements made in a spirit of antagonism against our 
struggle to the effect that "the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] does not favor a solution," or that "the PKK has no 
policy other than the establishment of a separate state," are 
unfounded allegations. 
  During the press conferences held before the eyes of the 
world especially during the cease-fire period, I tried to 
explain that we are not averse to a solution and that it is the 
Turkish Republic that rejects the peace proposals. Such 
allegations are being constantly and intentionally dwelled upon. 
In view of this and on the occasion of the conference I find it 
useful to very clearly reiterate our position: 
  1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution, and 
to the initiatives that might be taken by foreign countries or 
international organizations on this issue. 
  2. I want to state with the upmost clarity that we have 
absolutely no intention of dividing Turkey and that propaganda 
to this effect does not reflect our real position. 
  3. I want to state that we will be a participant in a 
process that might be initiated with the Turkish state on the 
basis of talks and dialogue within democracy to give expression 
to our people's legitimate demands and achieve results on this 
issue. From the very start, we have not opposed or been averse 
to concrete proposals for a solution. We are prepared to 
discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a 
federation. 
  4. We will not avoid or obstruct the establishment of a 
mutual cease-fire to be followed by talks on a solution under 
international supervision. 
  5. Most importantly, I pledge to accept the decisions on a 
solution that you might make at the conference. I am also 
announcing that we will pave the way for the total termination 
of the armed struggle if the ground is prepared for a political 
solution and free political activity. 
  It is obvious that ours is not a position that seeks 
solution 
only in war. Besides, the war is not of our own choosing. It 
is the Turkish Government that has forced us into this and 
reduced us to defending our national existence by such methods, 
and which behaves with intransigence and cruelty to terrorize 
our people, thinking that it could obtain results only by waging 
special warfare. 
  With this, I wish your endeavors to be productive and 
efficacious. I express my conviction that you will reach 
important decisions for a solution, and wholeheartedly salute 
the conference. 
  Wishing you success, Abdullah Ocalan, general secretary of 
PKK."

  [Text] Aydin (AA) -- Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has 
said: We cannot damage democracy by sitting at the negotiating 
table with Abdullah Ocalan [leader of the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. 
  Speaking at a news conference in Aydin, Mentese noted that 
the backbone of the separatist organization has been broken in 
the struggle waged against terror and added: 
  The government had to take certain measures regarding 
various 
developments in the country. As a matter of fact, we have 
managed to break the backbone of the separatist organization 
through the measures we have taken. 
  The necessary measures have been taken throughout the 
country 
to ensure that the 27 March elections are held in a secure 
atmosphere. These measures are also valid for the Nevruz holiday 
celebrations to be held on 21 March. We are sending some 
150,000 troops to the southeastern Anatolian region to ensure 
security during the elections. 
  Mentese said that the leader of the separatist organization, 
Ocalan, has been exerting efforts beyond belief to sit at the 
negotiating table within a political framework with the Turkish 
Republic in a bid to keep his name and his organization on the 
world agenda and added: He will, however, never be able to 
realize this because we are rejecting this proposal which is 
tantamount to harming democracy. 
  Mentese concluded by saying that a draft bill is being 
prepared that will regulate the passage through the Bosporus of 
tankers carrying dangerous cargo.

  [Text] The Greek Government will send Greece's reply on The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to UN special 
mediator Cyrus Vance in the next few days, Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias said. He made the remark this morning shortly 
before leaving for Washington where he will attend the signing 
at the White House tomorrow of an agreement on the 
Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Papoulias is 
going to Washington as president of the European Union's [EU] 
General Affairs Council. 
  Answering correspondents' questions, the foreign minister 
said that the reply to Vance will be sent through diplomatic 
channels and described the Vance ideas as a good start. To 
another question, Papoulias said he would meet in Washington 
with Hans Van Den Broek, EU commissioner in charge of foreign 
affairs, who, as the Greek foreign minister noted, submitted a 
document to the EU to which the Greek side has replied. 
  Asked by correspondents what the Greek position would be if 
the Turks sent troops to Bosnia, Papoulias stressed that the 
Greek position was outlined in a communique issued by the 
President's Office. Asked if Turkey is sending blue helmet 
troops to Bosnia, the foreign minister said: A decision was 
made on the party leaders' level. According to the communique 
from the President's Office, Greece insists on its basic 
position that no Balkan force should become involved. We 
persist in attempting to avert such a thing and in persuading 
those who want to send the Turks that this would complicate the 
Balkan situation.

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Marios Ploritis: "Concerns and Shameless </F>
Actions: The Embargo's Double-Edged Sword"] 
  [Excerpts] The embargo decided by the government 11 days 
ago is a strange coin. Strange and poisonous. 
  On the one side of the coin, the embargo seems to be the 
result of need, the "ultimate measure" or "countermeasure" 
against [Kiro] Gligorov's [president of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] intransigence and provocative 
stance. 
  "Ultimate," of course, since we lost all the battles on 
account of our own aimlessness and silliness. The problem now is 
whether the "ultimate measure" may become the "ultimate 
punishment" for us. Let us review this, going against the 
current of enthusiasm generated by the government's decision. 
  It is commonplace to say that such measures are only 
justified if they are not proved "nonultimate," that is, if they 
lead to the fruitful untying of the Gordian knot and not to 
worse entanglements (and we are not talking of "war," of course, 
an eventuality that even the most paranoid among us cannot 
grasp). In other words, how effective and how painless for us is 
the embargo? 
  1. The effectiveness of the economic embargo against a given 
country is always doubtful when it is applied solely by one 
country, as vital as the "door" of the country imposing the 
embargo may be for the other party. The embargoed country will 
seek an outlet from other neighboring countries willing to help 
as long as their interests are not affected. This is all the 
more true in the case of FYROM, which can be resupplied, not 
only through the Bulgarian city of Pirgos and the Albanian city 
of Dhyrrakhion, but also from other rich and sympathetic 
countries. [passage omitted] 
  2. The Greek measures are aimed at bending Gligorov's 
intransigence. However, it is not improbable that our action 
will increase it and shape it, because Gligorov, who is viewed 
by the "international community" as "wronged" and "persecuted," 
will be proclaimed the "martyr of the Balkans," whom Athens' 
Neros are throwing into a lion's den of hunger and asphyxiation. 
Like the Christians thrown into the Roman arenas, Mr Gligorov 
will have every reason to persist in his "faith," encouraged by 
the applause of his philanthropic extollers. [passage omitted] 
  Thus the "countermeasures" may become "antimeasures," a 
boomerang for the "measure-takers" and a "golden opportunity" 
for the real troublemakers in the Balkans. 
  The other side of the coin depicts the bottomless 
shamelessness of the "important" others. [passage omitted] 
Foreign ministers, foreign diplomats, and the foreign media 
"bad-mouth" Greece because: 
  I. "The embargo will destabilize the Balkans." This is 
repeated by those who, through their hasty recognition of the 
Yugoslav republics, blew up Balkan stability and caused the 
terrible civil conflagration for "shameful goals." (They even 
admit it themselves in more lucid moments). It could be said 
that their "post-facto knowledge" would somehow bring them back 
to reality, but of course, it is not in their interest to do 
so... 
  2. "The Greek embargo is an overreaction. It is unjustified 
and especially harsh." However, was their own embargo against 
Serbia any less harsh? Was it dictated by humaneness or by naked 
partiality against one of the adversaries, declared "the only 
guilty party, the only barbarian, the only killer of innocent 
people"? [passage omitted] 
  As for the allegation that only thanks to the embargo 
against 
the Serbs and the specter of NATO intervention were some peace 
avenues opened up in the former Yugoslavia, it justifies the 
Greek embargo, whose goal is the solution of the FYROM impasse 
without the bloodshed of their own "measures." 
  3. "FYROM's isolation violates Community solidarity." Here, 
shamelessness becomes audacity, since today's advocates of 
Community unity repeatedly and massively ignored the much touted 
"solidarity" by recognizing the FYROM statelet--which does not 
belong to the Community--thus showing total disregard for a 
Community partner. In addition, this was done without even 
taking the trouble to inform this partner of the recognition, 
and now they blame us because we did not previously inform them 
of our "measures!" 
  4. "The embargo violates international and Community law," 
and other such tearful arguments. This has already been answered 
by the Greek Government and reliable international experts. It 
is useless to repeat what has already been said. Naturally, 
concern about "international law" is at least shameful on the 
part of those guilty of innumerable violations, invasions, 
embargoes, and killings all over the world in disregard of laws, 
rules, and regulations, as long as their economic and strategic 
interests were served. [passage omitted] As it is, shameless 
profit is the "real meat" of their humanitarian concerns: their 
own political, economic, and strategic goals, the movement of 
their products (which the Greek embargo prevents) and the 
disarray in their plans to create protectorates in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  Having spoken of a coin in the beginning, these, then, are 
the great counterfeiters who "go hunting with saintly pretexts, 
but hide shameful purposes in their souls." Their souls, meaning 
their pockets....

  [Editorial Report] The 1 March Athens daily TA NEA 
published the results of an ALKO/MARTEL telephone poll conducted 
in the greater Athens area on 21 and 22 February among 800 
individuals over 18. The poll centered on the embargo imposed by 
Greece on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and 
on negotiations with that country. 
  Respondents were asked whether "in adopting measures against 
FYROM, we should..." 
  --be careful they do not lead us to a conflict with our 
European partners: 
63.1 percent 
  --disregard the fact that they may lead us to a conflict: 
31.1 percent 
  --do not know, do not answer: 5.8 percent 
  The next question focused on whether "you agree or disagree 
on the measures against FYROM?" 
  --Agree: 82.7 percent 
  --Disagree: 14 percent 
  --Do not know, do not answer: 3.3 percent 
  Respondents were also asked their views on the issue of 
Skopje's name. 
  --Reject any negotiation: 11.8 percent 
  --Negotiate, but make no concessions: 36.3 percent 
  --Negotiate and make small concessions: 23.8 percent 
  --Negotiate and reach a middle ground: 25.8 percent 
  --Do not know, do not answer: 2.3 percent 
  Next, respondents were asked: "If we do not make any 
concessions on the name issue, do you think that the danger that 
FYROM may be recognized under the name of Macedonia is..." 
  --great: 67.2 percent 
  --small: 15 percent 
  --no danger: 10.1 percent 
  --do not know, do not answer: 7.7 percent 
  Finally, respondents were asked whether former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Andonis Samaras is responsible for the present 
situation. Some 66.4 percent agreed that he is.

<F P=106> [Article by "The Observer": "The Cowboy With the F-16's!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The saloon door opened suddenly. The dusty 
cowboy, the "Lone Ranger" [preceding two words in English] 
kicked the door, drew his pistols and fired "from the hip" 
[preceding three words in English], breaking four whiskey 
bottles over the bartender's head. It was a real "Western" 
scene, which was repeated in recent days over Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with the downing of the four "unknown" aircraft by the terrible 
war machine of the "Master of the Planet" who went to his "oval 
office" and, facing television cameras, spoke to his "subjects" 
around the world. Because now the saloon has become 
international and the cowboy's shots have been replaced with 
"F-16's" carrying air-to-air missiles. Today, however, they did 
not break some whiskey bottles, but four aircraft with four 
persons aboard, while hundreds of lives are lost daily on the 
ground. We are talking of human lives, and not of ethnicities or 
religions. 
  Indeed, the logical explanation a simple man could give for 
this incident is its relation to the cowboy's spectacular 
entrance into the "international" saloon. Because the new world 
gendarme, who also calls himself "Master of the Planet," wants 
to remind people around the world that the power is his. Because 
now, since there is no opposing power as there was some years 
ago, all the world's inhabitants, and mainly those in Europe, 
must digest the fact that there is a "Master of the Planet." And 
of course, he found a little man he could hit to ensure that his 
victims cannot react with real bullets. The simple man in the 
street is asking: If the four aircraft, which were "like mice in 
front of a tiger," were Russian, would American generals and 
admirals, who used NATO as their "alibi," down them so easily? 
NATO, this collective organ that has turned from a defense 
mechanism against the communist threat to an executive tool of 
the United States. So, we have "Rambo" leaving the swamps of 
Vietnam and coming to Europe, and especially the Balkans. And of 
course, he wants his entrance on the "scene"--because let's not 
forget that everything today is a television spectacle--to be 
made in an impressive manner. The "producers" have thus chosen 
an easy target: the four little aircraft which, as the Americans 
themselves would say, were "sitting ducks" [preceding two words 
in English] for those awesome war machines, the F-16's. 
  It is difficult for the simple man in the street to 
understand what is happening now in this tragic region of 
Europe. Things are so mixed up, there are so many ethnicities 
and religions fighting against each other, warring parties are 
so confused that no one can comprehend what is really going on, 
who is right and who is wrong. [passage omitted] No one knows 
who is the real target of the various "events" that appear on 
our television screens. 
  We thus find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. We are 
not the only ones: more tragically, international "leaders" are 
confused as well. Because, to begin with, they are all "little 
men" disguised as "tigers" and they only think of their 
reelection and of what "image" they will "sell" to their people. 
But thousands of lives are lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It makes 
no difference if they are Muslims, Serbs, or Croats. They are 
all people losing their lives, their homes, their families. And 
no one seems to really care. We see those who once upon a time 
were demonstrating for the "Shining Path" or "Farabundo Marti" 
remaining silent. And what are we doing? We are not speaking up. 
Because we have lost our self-respect since selling our humanity 
in exchange for a consumer pseudo-society!

  [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  Evert-Mitsotakis Clash </H5>
  According to Yiannis Politis writing in the 28 February 
Athens daily TA NEA, Konstandinos Mitsotakis, former leader of 
the New Democracy (ND) party and present honorary chairman, has 
resumed daily appearances in the Chamber of Deputies and 
elsewhere, thus refuting rumors that he "retired" after stepping 
down. In public, Mitsotakis is also expressing differences with 
present ND leader Miltiadhis Evert, the only agreement between 
the two being the fact that "the gap separating them cannot be 
bridged." Politis cites officials well acquainted with 
Mitsotakis as stating that the former prime minister's primary 
goal is to regain the leadership of the party as a "savior who 
will rescue it from disaster." However, this goal could only be 
achieved were the ND to suffer a resounding defeat in the 
European Parliamentary elections and the next municipal 
elections that would lead to a "change of heart" of the ND 
parliamentary representation and party officials, the great 
majority of whom elected Evert to his post. Mitsotakis' 
secondary goal is the creation of a new party despite his 
reluctance to do so, Politis continues. The former prime 
minister "cannot just go home," and has already sought out the 
opinion of friendly deputies. While the reaction has so far been 
muted, Mitsotakis is under pressure from dissatisfied ND 
officials, who are urging him to move in the direction of a 
harsher opposition policy. 
<H5>  ND and Euroelections </H5>
  It is very important for the ND to make a good showing in 
the 
Euroelections, writes Stamos Zoulas in the 6 March Athens daily 
I KATHIMERINI. Following the nine-year leadership of 
Konstandinos Mitsotakis, this is the first time the party is 
facing elections under Evert, who will thus be given the 
opportunity to prove that the ND lost to the Panhellenic 
Socialist Movement (PASOK) more on account of Mitsotakis' 
failures than because of PASOK's successes. Another challenge to 
the ND is the existence of Political Spring, a splinter 
political party for which Mitsotakis is also held responsible, 
Zoulas continues. Winning votes away from this party in the 
Euroelections would confirm that Mitsotakis was the problem, he 
comments. 
  A third critical element of the Euroelections for the ND is 
the general condition of PASOK, Zoulas states. Since this is the 
first time PASOK faces elections while following a "clearly 
unpopular" economic policy, the ND hopes that [Prime Minister 
Andreas] Papandreou's party will suffer significant electoral 
attrition. Finally, the government's obvious disorganization 
gives the impression that PASOK has entered a "post-Papandreou" 
era. Coupled with Papandreou's "disengagement" from a dynamic 
prime ministerial role, intragovernmental dissension will likely 
be perceived as government "paralysis," Zoulas concludes. 
<H5>  Origins of Political Spring </H5>
  "Political Spring is not the result of parthenogenesis," 
writes Stefanos Tzanakis in the 3 March Athens daily TA NEA. 
Most adherents were in the ND until last summer, he adds. 
According to information cited by Tzanakis, 55 to 60 percent of 
Political Spring members come from the ND, followed by a 
reported 10 percent from the Coalition of the Left for Progress, 
and 5 percent from the Communist Party (KKE). Tzanakis cites 
Political Spring officials as asserting that, in addition, 5 
percent of party members are former PASOK partisans who withdrew 
or were proscribed from that party. These same officials believe 
that the party must attract new members after the Euroelections; 
they maintain this will not be difficult if Political Spring 
achieves double-digit electoral support in June. 
<H5>  Secret Political Report </H5>
  According to Nikos Marakis writing in the 6 March TO VIMA 
TIS 
KIRIAKIS, Miltiadhis Evert commissioned a secret study of the 
various parties to help him define ND strategy. TO VIMA got hold 
of a copy, Marakis writes, quoting excerpts on the weaknesses of 
the three main parties. 
  ND's present ills are mainly attributed to the image of 
social injustice and indifference the party projected during 
1990-1993. According to the report, "the party's liberal views 
were affected by erroneous government actions" which, unless 
corrected, will lead many Greeks to the permanent impression 
that "a liberal, free market stance is synonymous with 
harshness, social injustice, layoffs, etc." The report also 
points out the "not inconsiderable signs of anachronistic 
practices evidenced by the ND as government and party in recent 
years," as well as public suspicion of "old-fashioned rightist 
mentality, favoritism, lack of ethics and transparency." While 
the report does not "dare refute" these impressions, Marakis 
continues, it notes that even if these accusations are somewhat 
unfair, "the ND's style of management was certainly 
anachronistic and riddled with mistakes." The report accuses the 
ND of "total lack of coordination and strategy, possessing 
mechanisms that only worked in theory...and bad choices of 
people." This contributed to the ND's "increasing isolation from 
quality elements in Greek society and the party." According to 
Marakis, the report also argues that the ND failed mainly 
because it "did not know how to handle power when it achieved it 
or, at a minimum, how to apply its political vision and plans." 
  While the report's judgments regarding PASOK suffer from a 
"strong dose of partiality," they are nevertheless interesting, 
Marakis continues. The report contends that while PASOK enjoys a 
wide popular and parliamentary majority, it is "especially 
weak," since it fails to convince "it can face the essence of 
existing problems." While not ignoring Papandreou's experience 
and ability to maneuver, as well as Minister of National Economy 
Yiorgos Yennimatas' expertise, the report concludes that 
"nothing can save the situation." PASOK's ideological identity 
is also reviewed in the report. Marakis continues. It notes that 
PASOK suffers from a "serious problem of political identity," 
for it is moving toward a "moderate social-democratic, 
European-type model," which is not followed by the mass of party 
officials who, overall, continue to nourish "clearly 
anti-European, micronationalistic, and vindicative feelings." 
  Maraltis cites the report as making "special mention of the 
phenomenon" of Political Spring and its leader Andonis Samaras. 
"In spite of favorable conditions such as deep dissatisfaction 
with the Mitsotakis government and Samaras' high popularity 
stemming from his exploitation of the FYROM issue," this is the 
first time, the report suggests, that "the center-right suffers 
an endogenous disruption of such proportions." Political Spring 
is viewed as "shallow and sentimental.. .neonationalistic... 
voluntarily obscure in expressing political positions," while 
Samaras himself is analyzed as "shallow but charming, lacking 
principles but excelling in projecting himself, approachable but 
essentially without qualms."

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In a brief article, the 24 February 
Athens daily I KATHIMERINI cites Theodhoros Pangalos, alternate 
minister of foreign affairs in charge of European affairs, as 
stating to the Athens daily MESIMVRINI that Greece is in bad 
economic straits. Pangalos also stressed the need for "five 
years of harsh austerity" and expressed the fear that the 
European Union [EU] may remand Greece to the control of the IMF. 
Pangalos, who, according to rumors, does not wish to remain in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs beyond the end of the Greek EU 
presidency in June, also disagrees with the government's ongoing 
"social dialogue" with professional classes. In this regard, the 
alternate minister said that "the government is conducting talks 
with representatives of tax evaders." The article comments that 
Pangalos clearly no longer intends to limit himself strictly to 
matters within his own purview, especially in light of the 
forthcoming Panhellenic Socialist Movement congress.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial report] Writing in the 27 February Athens daily 
I KATHIMERINI, Yiannis Loulis comments on the results of two 
ALKO polls conducted in December 1993 and one ALKO-MARTEL poll 
conducted in January 1994 [no further information]. 
  In the middle of December, respondents were asked to 
evaluate 
what are the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government's 
three most positive and three most negative initiatives: 
  Positive 
  --It is open to a dialogue with social groups: 26.3 percent 
  --It is (for the moment) less bad than the previous 
government 25.4 percent 
  --It is moderate: 25.3 percent 
  Negative 
  --It is not delivering on its preelectoral promises (for 
instance, no new 
taxes): 33.1 percent 
  --It lacks a clear program to face economic problems: 25.3 
percent 
  --It adheres to old partisan concepts (for instance, hiring 
its followers): 
23.2 percent 
  The ALKO poll was conducted from 5 to 12 December 1993, and 
the ALKO-MARTEL poll on 26-27 January [no further information]. 
  Respondents were asked whether they were confident that the 
measures announced by the government are sufficient to face the 
economic crisis. In December, 23.6 percent expressed confidence, 
a figure that increased to 30.3 percent in January. Some 37.8 
percent in December and 56.7 percent in January expressed their 
lack of confidence, while 35.3 percent in December and 9.3 
percent in January said it was too early to judge. A total of 
3.4 percent in December and 3.7 percent in January did not know. 
  According to Loulis, two contrasting views prevailed 
following the October 1993 elections that brought PASOK back to 
power. The first maintained that the new government's grace 
period would be quite brief, given the public's weariness and 
increasing impatience. According to the second current of 
opinion, the grace period would be rather long, for such was the 
public's anger with the previous administration that the PASOK 
government would need time to "expunge negative memories." Poll 
results show that "the truth lies somewhere inbetween," Loulis 
notes. If the grace period seems to be holding, the first 
rumblings are being heard. "While the government may not awaken 
negative feelings, it is instilling increasingly less confidence 
about its abilities," Loulis comments. Therefore, the reason for 
the government's reluctance to adopt additional economic 
measures is the feeling that the public's tolerance is wearing 
thin. In fact, the December poll revealed that 32 percent of the 
respondents believe such measures are "necessary," but only 9.7 
percent say they are "realistic" and 3.55 percent that they are 
"justified." According to the January poll, 18.5 percent view 
the measures as "leading to an impasse," 16.5 percent see them 
as "harsh," and 14.4 percent as "unfair."

  [Excerpts] German President Richard von Weizsaecker 
received Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' this afternoon. 
Al-Shar' conveyed President Hafiz al-Asad's greetings to the 
German president, who asked him to convey to the president his 
best wishes and warmest condolences on the death of Staff Major 
Basil al-Asad. 
  Talks dealt with regional developments and the peace 
process. 
In this regard, the German president emphasized Syria's 
important regional role under the leadership of President Hafiz 
al-Asad. He reiterated Germany's condemnation of the Hebron 
massacre and hoped that this crime, which was condemned 
worldwide, would not affect the peace process in the region. 
  Earlier this morning, the Syrian side led by Faruq al-Shar' 
and the German side led by Klaus Kinkel held a session of 
official talks at the German Foreign Ministry in Bonn. [passage 
omitted] 
  The two sides exchanged views on ways to bolster and develop 
bilateral relations in various areas and in a manner that serves 
the interests of the two countries and peoples and contributes 
to peace and stability in the region. The two ministers 
reviewed relations between Syria and the European Union and 
stressed the importance of developing cooperation between them 
on all levels. Talks centered on the situation in the region, 
particularly the developments of the peace process and its 
future prospects. In this regard, Kinkel stressed Syria's 
important role in achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting 
peace in the region. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking to reporters in Bonn today, Faruq al-Shar' said: 
For peace to be comprehensive and achieve security and 
stability in the region, the well-known peace requirements 
should be met. These are full withdrawal from the occupied Arab 
territories and implementation of Resolutions 242 and 338, and 
425 on Lebanon. Otherwise, talk about peace will be mere talk 
that will not produce concrete results. On the contrary, using 
hollow phrases about peace without real results will lead to new 
acts of violence and terrorism similar to the massacre at the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque.

<F P=106> ["koe" report: "Bonn Expects Growth Stimuli From `Key </F>
Market' Telecommunications"] 
  [Text] Hannover -- Post and Telecommunications Minister 
Wolfgang Boetsch calls for a speedy liberalization of the 
telecommunications market. At the opening of CeBit '94, the 
international computer fair in Hannover, which runs until 23 
March, Boetsch pointed to the key position of this "market of 
markets." According to experts' estimates, the worldwide volume 
for communication services will be 1.5 trillion German marks 
[DM] by the turn of the millennium; in 1990 it was only DM700 
billion. This development harbors enormous opportunities of 
growth for competitive, flexible industries. 
  By the year 2010 approximately DM2.4 trillion will be 
invested in the European Union in the modernization of 
telecommunications infrastructures, the minister stated 
referring to the Prognos AG market research institute. In 
addition, considerable resources are going to East Europe. A 
future-oriented policy creates investment-promoting framework 
conditions. The rising pressure of international competition 
also intensifies the trend toward private telecommunications 
companies. 
  The positive effects of liberalization can be demonstrated 
in 
Germany with the examples of mobile radio and satellite radio 
communications. Thus, the introduction of competition in mobile 
radio telephone systems has led to an increase in the number of 
participants from 200,000 to 1.8 million over the past five 
years. During the same period, the price for mobile radio 
telephone equipment fell from about DM6,000 to DM1,000. In 
addition, the opening of the market led to an "impressive 
variety of private initiatives," Boetsch said. In Germany 47 
licenses for private satellite networks were issued until 
February this year. Not least, the number of companies offering 
telecommunications services, which was just 66 at the end of 
January 1991, increased to 381 by the second week of this 
February. 
<H5>  "Europe is Lagging Behind" </H5>
  In the view of the post minister, industry is preparing for 
new times. Sooner or later, the "television set at home will 
become an interactive information and communication center," and 
that not just in Germany. Therefore, harmonization in the field 
of European telecommunications is more important than ever. 
Boetsch: "The simultaneous introduction of Euro-ISDN 
[Integrated Services Digital Network] in all member states will 
make an essential contribution to enlarging the 
telecommunications market." At the moment, Euro-ISDN is being 
installed by 26 network operators from 20 countries. 
  Klaus Murmann, president of the Federation of German 
Employers' Associations, said that the European locations for 
production and services are not yet competitive. In the United 
States and also in East Asia the input-output ratio is often 
better than that of European competitors, which leads to 
production being shifted to these areas. While Europe's share 
in world trade is going down, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and 
Taiwan, for instance, have doubled their share to 9 percent of 
work exports over the past 10 years. Europe is also lagging 
behind regarding the creation of new jobs. Over the past 20 
years the European Community has created only 0.4 percent of new 
jobs, compared with an annual average growth of 1 percent in 
Japan and of 1.8 percent in the United States. 
  In Murmann's view, Germany is in the mood for a new start. 
The way toward new structures of labor organization, work time, 
and labor costs has been paved by the latest wage contract for 
the metal industry. Productivity will increase in Germany. The 
average personnel costs increased by 5 percent in 1992. This 
year the increase is between 0.0 and 2 percent. In order to 
correct the wage policy mistakes of the past decade, one needs 
more than three years, Murmann said. He imagines wage contracts 
that outline a minimum framework and permit leeway for 
components that depend on performance and yield.

<F P=106> [Report by Jan Bohets: "Growth Must Rise Consistently, But </F>
It Is Not Clear How"] 
  [Text] Whether or not Belgium overcomes its financial, 
economic, and social problems will depend to a great extent on 
economic growth. Things do not look good unless the rate of 
expansion can be brought above the average of the recent past. 
However, there are no indications that we can raise growth 
consistently. 
  Of course, further economic growth has results which a 
mature 
industrial society does not favor; nevertheless, it is 
essential. Very few people would discourage progress in material 
terms. Sufficient economic growth represents just the beginning 
of the solution to the government's financial problems and the 
unemployment problem. The rate of economic growth is also of 
crucial importance in coping with the problem of the aging 
[population]. 
  It is important that the growth not be accompanied by a 
significant rise in inflation or a sharp rise in interest rates. 
That would create more problems than it would solve. 
  However, nobody can see where this faster growth will come 
from. The average over the past 20 years is just 2 percent, 
compared to 5 percent annually in the period from 1960 to 1973. 
If we look at the figures for each decade -- a questionable 
idea since it would be better to compare the entire economic 
cycle -- the systematic drop is even more striking: an average 
of 4.8 percent per year in the 1960's (1960-69), 3.5 percent in 
the 1970's, 2 percent in the 1980's, and 1.3 percent -- so far 
-- in the 1990's. 
  When evaluating the figures, account must of course be taken 
of the level effect: High growth figures are more difficult to 
achieve as the economy grows. All the more reason to wonder how 
the Belgian economy will manage in the coming years to perform 
better than in the past 20 years. 
  A difference of 1 point per year seems insignificant, but 
that is not true of course. If the economy maintains a cruising 
speed of 2 percent per year, then that would yield a cumulative 
total of 15 percent by the year 2000, and 71 percent by the year 
2020. If an average of 3 percent were achieved, the respective 
percentages become 23 and 122. If growth were to reach just 1 
percent per year, then the respective cumulative amounts would 
be 7 and 31 percent. 
<H5>  More and Better </H5>
  The increase in the gross domestic product determines the 
growth in tax revenue and also influences spending. It has 
become apparent that growth of more than 2 percent is needed to 
avid a worsening condition in government finances and the labor 
market. 
  What can be said about the growth prospects, with the 
necessary caution? One can depart from a reassuring conclusion: 
Growth is almost inevitable. Scientific and technological 
progress will continue, and this will spontaneously lead to a 
further increase in productivity. Higher productivity means 
more production with just as many people, or just as much 
production with fewer people. The policy would have to be very 
bad, or the circumstances would have to be strongly opposite to 
neutralize this productivity effect. 
  Growth must primarily be brought about through a greater or 
better effort by labor, capital, and management. 
  The percentage of people working in Belgium is lower than 
elsewhere in the industrial world, and the rise in unemployment 
and the trend toward early retirement further aggravate this 
problem. Further reductions in working time would accentuate 
this trend even more: lower employment because of slow growth, 
less growth because of falling employment. 
  The way in which capital is used also does little to promote 
growth. The high volume of savings by individuals serves, in 
the first instance, to cover the government's borrowing 
requirement. It is good that the government only needs to turn 
to foreign financiers to a limited degree, but the situation 
would be better if it were not dependent on the creation of 
further debt. In all fairness, it should be added that money is 
always found for worthy and vital projects. 
  As for management, there is no reason why we should have 
fewer clever entrepreneurs than other countries. It should be 
clear that over the past 30 years Belgium, more than any other 
industrial country, has depended on foreign investments, while 
the required capital was often found here. In recent years, 
there has been great concern about Belgium's declining 
attraction for foreign investors and the shrinking Belgian share 
in American and Japanese foreign investments, among others. 
<H5>  Spending </H5>
  If we want to increase the potential growth of the Belgian 
economy, then investment must be increased. One requirement has 
already been met temporarily: Private savings have risen to 20 
percent of disposable income, a level that has probably not been 
reached since the war. However, experience shows that such a 
high rate of saving can only be reached at the lowest point in a 
recession, if the people are very concerned, and if businesses 
do not feel much need to invest. In order to maintain a high 
level of saving in the coming period, with its improved economic 
climate, the government's lack of saving -- i.e., its deficit -- 
must be lowered. 
  In addition, the cost effectiveness of capital, in other 
words the profitability of businesses, must be brought back to 
the level of the 1960's. In order to promote employment and 
make it possible to increase profits, wage costs must not rise 
for some time. Any wage increases may not absorb the entire 
increase in productivity. 
  Lastly, Belgium must continue quickly adapting to changing 
international circumstances. World trade will probably be the 
most powerful driving force behind growth, and the best chances 
will be offered by the young industrial countries which strike 
fear in our heart.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Caoimghin O'Crolrin, member of </F>
Sinn Fein National Executive Board, by Marcelo Justo "in 
London"; date not given] 
  [Text] In London there is talk of sending the Army to guard 
Heathrow airport which has been the target of three IRA attacks 
in the last five days. Yet the British Government insisted 
yesterday that the peace process begun through the Downing 
Street Declaration, which was agreed to in December with the 
Republic of Ireland, "still stands" and "needs no clarification." 
  The IRA issued its first response to the declaration at 
about 
midnight on 12 December. It emphasized the need for John 
Major's government "to abandon its negative attitude," a key 
phrase used by the Catholic and republican organization to 
reassert its demand for the "clarification" of certain points in 
a text that seeks to appease all without satisfying anyone. The 
complex political scenario of Northern Ireland encompasses two 
countries -- the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain -- with 
violent and peaceful Catholic nationalists; legal and 
clandestine Protestants. Sinn Fein holds a particularly 
important place as the political wing of the IRA and the 
mandatory representative in any negotiation with the IRA. 
Caoimghin O'Crolrin, a Sinn Fein National Executive Board 
member, told PAGINA/12: "The Downing Street Declaration is not 
dead." During a long telephone interview, O'Crolrin explained 
that the IRA attacks are a variant of the IRA's policy which 
seeks to "involve the British in different fields," by forcing 
them to respond politically and militarily. Within this 
context, O'Crolrin, who insisted he was speaking on behalf of 
Sinn Fein, did not reject the possibility of further IRA attacks. 
  [PAGINA/12] Is it not contradictory to talk about achieving 
peace while attacking one of the busiest airports in the world? 
  [O'Crolrin] Sinn Fein deplores all violent actions. We do 
not want any violence -- from the IRA, from the British 
Government, or from its surrogate Protestant paramilitary 
groups. But we do not condemn violence out of context. 
Violence can only be eliminated if all parties cease to use it, 
including the British Government. Moreover, we believe the IRA 
communique issued last night was positive because it clearly 
shows a willingness to achieve peace. This is how it was viewed 
in Ireland: As the expression of the desire to continue the 
negotiations. The British media interpreted it differently. To 
put it more plainly, the British media interpreted the opposite. 
The IRA communique urges the government to discontinue its 
negative attitude, which became obvious when it rejected the 
peace plan that was agreed last year by Sinn Fein President 
Gerry Adams and Social Democratic Party President John Hume. 
Despite this, we do not reject the Downing Street Declaration: 
We consider it ambiguous, which is the way it has been 
interpreted by a wide political spectrum. We have thus 
requested an explanation. The Irish Government has given us an 
explanation but they can only speak on behalf of the Irish 
Government. The British Government has so far refused to do so. 
Yet John Major had no qualms in granting an explanation at the 
time to Protestant Unionist parties. 
  [PAGINA/12] What must the British Government explain to 
convince the IRA to renounce violence? 
  [O'Crolrin] We accept no preconditions for negotiations. 
When the British Government hosted the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
negotiations in 1992 it did not establish any prerequisites. It 
seems that it does so with the Sinn Fein and the IRA. Not just 
the surrender of arms but -- to use British Government 
terminology -- the establishment of a "purification" period. 
The British Government is the one that must "purify" itself 
before negotiating with us. We are neither the second rate 
citizens of a nation nor will we be treated as a scourge. But 
beyond all this, there are certain issues that must be 
explained. The declaration states that it supports Ireland's 
self determination but adds that it demands the consent of the 
people. 
  [PAGINA/12] The stumbling block of the declaration seems to 
be that it seeks to satisfy the Protestant Unionist -- by 
stating that it will not modify anything without their consent 
-- and the Catholics -- by stating that it seeks the self 
determination for Ireland, which is precisely what the Unionists 
do not want. What is the solution? 
  [O'Crolrin] For us the issue began in 1921 when -- against 
the wishes of the Irish -- their country was divided. Only 
within the context of national democracy, reconciliation, and 
lasting peace can we go forward. We have a series of proposals 
within this framework. It is obvious that we do not think we 
have a monopoly on anything. We will listen to all options 
proposed by other political groups. This, of course, includes 
the Protestants who are an important part of our society. But 
we reject the idea that any sector has the right to veto anyone 
because such an action goes against democratic principles in any 
society in the world. Unfortunately, this is one interpretation 
of the Downing Street Declaration. This is why the British 
Government must clarify the declaration or it will lose a 
historic opportunity of achieving peace.

  [Text] The Prime Minister was flying out to the former 
Yugoslavia tonight on a morale-boosting visit to Britain's 
troops in the war zone. 
  John Major's trip, only formally announced this afternoon, 
was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons and full details 
were still not being disclosed. 
  He will be giving a pat on the back to some of Britain's 
2,000 troops working to reinforce the fragile truces in Bosnia. 
  Mr Major, keen to build on the peace breaking out across 
central Bosnia, is also expected to talk with military leaders 
and politicians. 
  He wants to assess the situation on the ground, and discuss 
future military and aid requirements should the truces around 
the capital Sarajevo and across central Bosnia be extended. 
  He also wishes to consider how the burden of future help 
could best be shared among the UN member countries. 
  Mr Major is expected to meet Lieutenant General Sir Michael 
Rose, the UN's commander in Bosnia. 
  Sir Michael's leadership has been hailed as a great success. 
His robust style has helped secure the ceasefires. 
  Mr Major's trip, expected to last no longer than 24 hours, 
comes as Serbs and Muslims signed an agreement ending the 
23-month-old seige of Sarajevo. 
  Under the deal, signed today under UN supervision, a bridge, 
key roads linking Serb and Muslim sections of the Bosnian 
capital and a route from Sarajevo into central Bosnia controlled 
by allied Muslims and Croats, will be freed. 
  The Prime Minister's visit also coincides with the arrival 
of 
the 900-strong reinforcement battalion based on the Duke of 
Wellington's Regiment. 
  The reinforcements will bring the total number of British 
troops in the region to 3,400. 
  Britain has played a leading role in trying to resolve the 
conflict, and in persuading other UN member countries last week 
to send an extra 7,200 troops to the region following pleas from 
military leaders. 
  The extra troops are needed to implement the ceasefires and 
create confidence. 
  Mr Major is likely to travel to Vitez where British 
Battalion 
One has its headquarters. The battalion is based on the 
Coldstream Guards with responsibility for the area from Maglaj 
in the north to Vitez and west to Travnik. 
  British Battalion Two, based on the Duke of Wellington's 
Regiment with its headquarters in Bugojno, is responsible for 
the area south of Vitez including Gorni Vakuf, which has been a 
key flashpoint, Tomislavgrad and Prozor. 
  Mr Major will be keen to meet the two commanding officers -- 
Lieutenant Colonel Peter Williams of the Coldstream Guards and 
Lt Col David Sanat-Olalla of the Duke of Wellington's Regiment. 
  He is also expected to meet Brigadier John Reith, overall 
commander of British forces in Bosnia and UN forces in the 
southwest sector and chairman of the Joint Commission set up 
with Croat and Muslim leaders. 
  Sarajevo is certain to be on Mr Major's itinerary, and he 
will want to assess the capital's infrastructure needs now the 
shelling has stopped. 
  Mr Major and U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a joint civil 
planning mission to Sarajevo to assess the state of basic 
services such as electricity and water following their meeting 
in Washington earlier this month. 
  Mr Major will want to assess the progress of the mission, 
and 
is expected to make some announcements on it. 
  Downing Street officials said Mr Major's first priority was 
to show personal support, and that of the Government and country 
at large, to the troops.

  [Excerpt] Cambrai, France, March 17 (AFP) -- France on 
Thursday [17 March] warned it might reconsider its participation 
in UN peacekeeping in Bosnia-Herzegovina if its soldiers could 
not "protect themselves" against aggression, the French defense 
minister said. 
  Francois Leotard spoke at a memorial service in honor of a 
French UN soldier killed in northwestern Bosnia last week. 
After the incident, France criticized the United Nations for 
its "lack of resolve" in responding to attacks on UN 
peacekeepers in sensitive Bosnian zones. 
  Leotard warned that the "resolve" of France and its soldiers 
in Bosnia could be sustained "only if our soldiers are, through 
the use of legitimate force, protected against aggression." 
  "We cannot accept that the rule of law is being disarmed and 
that violence is going unpunished," he said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Jacques Isnard: "French Forces Reorganized"] </F>
  [Text] At the explicit request of Francois Mitterrand, the 
French UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent in Sarajevo 
will be reinforced -- from 2,280 men today to around 3,135 -- in 
the framework of a supposedly even vaster reorganization of the 
military forces in the former Yugoslavia. This new contingent 
of some 855 extra men consists of engineers and will contribute 
to the restoration of the main public services in Sarajevo 
itself. This redeployment of French forces in the region and 
even in the Adriatic is likely to be done in several stages. 
  The French battalion (900 men) at Glina, in Krajina (part of 
Croatia occupied by the Serbs), which currently consists of the 
27th Alpine Division's light infantry, will be relieved by 
members of the 7th Armored Division. However, France plans to 
definitively withdraw its UNPROFOR troops from Glina on 15 June. 
The United Nations has already been informed of the move. 
  In Bosnia itself, the reorganization also affects Tuzla and 
Sarajevo while, on the former Yugoslav coast, the aircraft 
carrier Foch currently patrolling the area is to be replaced by 
the Clemenceau, probably at the end of March. In Tuzla, France 
has just assigned an attachment of 54 men to the airport, 
consisting of 32 engineers (mine disposal experts) and 22 others 
(for air traffic control and the fire service). 
  Lastly, the 855-men Sarajevo reinforcement will be taken 
from 
the 9th Naval Infantry Division (based in Nantes) and the 11th 
Parachute Division (from Toulouse). These are troops 
specializing in mine disposal, engineering operations, and the 
restoration of public services. They may be supplemented by EDF 
[French Electricity Company] engineers. This battalion will be 
deployed in Rajlovac, west of Sarajevo, between 23 March and 6 
April, with no fewer than 300 vehicles of various types, 
including a squadron of 12 Sagaie light armored vehicles. It 
will join up with two other battalions already stationed at the 
airport and in the eastern part of the town. 
  The forces have been reorganized and increased in Sarajevo 
at 
the explicit request of the head of state. Despite the upcoming 
withdrawal from Glina, France remains the highest contributor to 
UNPROFOR, with some 6,000 troops out of a total of 10,000 
(including, in addition to the UN troops, the naval forces in 
the Adriatic and the airmen based in Italy). 
  Since October 1992, the French have also been the only UN 
force in the besieged Muslim enclave of Bihac, where they have a 
battalion of 1,200 men. For some weeks, the Serbs have been 
putting the enclave under great pressure and have been bullying 
the 5th Bosnian Army Corps, which comes under the mandate of 
Sarajevo and whose survival is largely dependent on the presence 
of the French UNPROFOR troops. Nonetheless, the French 
contingent has for some time been caught between the two camps 
and is meeting with more difficulties than in the past. The 
visit of the prime minister on Sunday 13 March again sparked 
persistent rumors -- that in reality have been heard since last 
year -- that France is to pull out. In that case the United 
Nations would have to find a replacement country. Military 
sources state that a withdrawal from Bihac is not planned. 
  That does not mean that the situation in Bihac is final. 
France is not hiding its intention of eventually regrouping its 
contribution to the UN effort in a single region, namely the 
town of Sarajevo. For security reasons first and foremost, but 
also because the France's capacity to supply UNPROFOR troops is 
coming into conflict with the amount of professional and 
enlisted or voluntary forces available. Other theaters of 
operation require the presence of the French Army, starting with 
Africa.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Bjorn Mansson: "Things Look Bad for the </F>
Nonsocialist Parties"] 
  [Text] Things look bad for both the Center Party and the 
National Coalition (Conservative) Party a little over a year 
before the parliamentary election, notes Bjorn Mansson, who 
discusses what they could do to try to avoid a Social Democratic 
hegemony after the election, something that would be unfortunate 
for democracy and the economy. 
  With only a little over a year left until the parliamentary 
election in March 1995, the situation does not look bright for 
the two big nonsocialist government parties. 
  The Coalition Party has borne government responsibility 
since 
1987 and thus shares the blame for both the economic crisis, 
whose origins should be sought during the so-called 
conservative-socialist government era, and the way in which it 
was handled. Finance Minister Iiro Viinanen has become a 
prominent symbol of the necessary, but unpopular austerity 
policy. 
  The Center Party has only been in the government since 1991 
and thus does not bear the same responsibility for the crisis, 
but it is responsible for how it has been handled. Prime 
Minister Esko Aho symbolizes what many see as a total failure in 
economic policy, the worst consequence of which is half a 
million people out of work. 
  Thus it was no wonder that neither party's candidate did 
very 
well in the presidential election. Ironically Raimo Ilaskivi, 
who, like the leftists, sharply criticized the government's 
economic policy, made a poorer showing than his party -- while 
Paavo Vayrynen, who was less critical of the government, 
received more votes than his party would get just now. 
  In a party poll in connection with one of the last 
presidential polls, both parties had a support level of 17.5 
percent -- compared with 15.2 for Ilaskivi and 19.5 for Vayrynen 
in the election. 
  Together with the third nonsocialist party of any 
consequence, the SFP [Swedish People's Party], the Center and 
Coalition parties reach a level of about 40 percent. The rest of 
the nonsocialist party field consists mainly of remnants. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) had a rating of 32.5 
percent in the same poll, almost as much as the Center and 
National Coalition parties combined. In addition, electoral 
mathematics favor a big party so that with this share of the 
votes the Social Democrats would get as many seats in parliament 
on their own as the Center and Coalition parties combined. 
  If the more than 10 percent the Left Alliance (Communist) 
received is included, it brings the left wing up to almost 45 
percent. If the SDP and the VL [Left Alliance] also form an 
election alliance, while the nonsocialists run separately, they 
could win at least half of the seats. 
  However an election alliance with the VL, including the 
former Taistoites, could be risky for the SDP. But even without 
this, the socialists and the Greens combined could easily win a 
red-green parliamentary majority. 
  With the SDP as the backbone of the government, Lipponen as 
prime minister, and Ahtisaari as president, the risk of 
single-party hegemony is obvious. This is always dangerous with 
reference to democracy's ability to function and when the SDP is 
involved, there is also a risk to the national economy. The 
socialist-conservative extravagance when Erkki Liikanen was 
finance minister was a central cause of the crisis. 
  The Social Democrats would be in an excellent position with 
regard to choosing nonsocialist government partners, there is 
reportedly a conservative and an environmentally-oriented school 
within the party already. The Coalition and Center parties would 
be destined to vie for the SDP's favor. 
  What can the nonsocialist parties do to avoid this kind of 
political situation? 
  If the SDP and the VL form an election alliance, the 
nonsocialists may also be forced to give much more consideration 
to taking a similar step than they have so far -- including an 
alliance between the Center and National Coalition parties. 
  However, it would be almost impossible to push through a 
cooperative agreement on the government formation, like the 
"strongbox agreement" before the 1987 election -- and it would 
not last anyway. And no matter how much they may be tempted to 
seek revenge for the SDP's treachery in 1991 by forcing a 
possibly scant red-green majority to rule alone in a similar 
way, the nonsocialist parties should display a greater sense of 
responsibility. 
  One of the nonsocialist parties' problems involves political 
leadership: The Center Party appears to have an oversupply of 
leaders competing with each other, while the question is whether 
the Coalition Party has any at all. 
  There is already a rumor in the Center Party that Vayrynen 
is 
on the point of allying himself with Seppo Kaariainen, who could 
then have a chance to defeat Aho for the post of party leader. 
However, for good or ill such a shift would involve a return to 
the agrarians. Therefore, the most likely thing is that the 
party congress will give Aho a continued mandate, but that party 
secretary Tikka may have to go. 
  Unless Vayrynen himself challenges Aho, which he does not 
seem to have ruled out. However, that would turn the clock back 
in a different way. 
  The presidential election results give the Center Party some 
hope in a way: After all the three Center candidates did win a 
good 28 percent of the votes. If we assume that up to half of 
those who voted for Korhonen and Kuuskoski were Center people, 
one out of four of those who voted for Vayrynen are not 
currently Center Party supporters. In other words they represent 
a potential. 
  In the National Coalition Party, party leader Pertti 
Salolainen's weakness is being revealed with increasing 
frequency. At the same time veteran, Ilaskivi did poorly 
(Coalition voters obviously preferred Rehn in the presidential 
election!) and former speaker Ilkka Suominen is leaving the 
political arena. Who is left except Viinanen? 
  The Coalition Party's gambit of backing a young new minister 
may have been smart with a view to young voters. The Center 
Party will have its chance soon when Ministers Pura and Pokka 
resign. 
  However, the nonsocialist parties cannot save themselves 
simply through image-enhancing cosmetic moves. Political 
substance is also required. 
  If economic developments take a serious turn that also has 
an 
impact on employment, and if the European Union (EU) 
negotiations can be brought to a conclusion that satisfies the 
entire country, much will have been won. But if not? 
  The government should not make any radical changes in its 
economic policy for tactical purposes, especially as this policy 
has finally begun to bear fruit. On the contrary, it should 
continue to pursue the course it has embarked on, especially as 
the balance of payments surplus has created more room for active 
efforts. 
  The SDP's warnings about an "election budget" are extremely 
hollow -- isn't it the SDP that has always demanded 
"stimulation" of the domestic market? 
  Vayrynen's relative success and especially Elisabeth Rehn's 
unequivocal one in the presidential election demonstrated 
convincingly that the voters respect consistency and honesty 
more than evasions and empty promises.

  [Excerpts] The whole of OK Petroleum will be sold to a 
businessman from Saudi Arabia, Shaykh Muhammad al-Amudi, who is 
paying 5.9 billion crowns for the biggest refinery company in 
the Nordic countries. Anders Munkesjoe reports: 
  [Munkesjoe] It has been known for quite some time that OK 
Petroleum is for sale. The previous owners, KF [Cooperative 
Association] with 52 percent, the Swedish state, and Neste of 
Finland with 24 percent each, have all for different reasons 
wanted to dispose of the company. The buyer now is a Saudi 
shaykh by the name of Muhammad al-Amudi. [passage omitted] 
  From the past, Shaykh al-Amudi has well developed contacts 
with Swedish industry. He has cooperated with AGEVE of Sweden 
for several decades. Under its new owner, OK Petroleum will now 
focus its sights on northern Europe, above all. There is an 
intention to buy retail networks for oil products in Poland and 
East Germany, markets which are judged to be very expansive. 
  OK Petroleum is the biggest refinery enterprise in the 
Nordic 
countries. With subsidiaries, the company has a staff of about 
2,000. Sixty percent of production is exported; the rest is 
mainly delivered to OK's gas stations which are not affected by 
this deal. Shaykh al-Amudi's voiced intent is to develop OK 
Petroleum in line with the strategy already existing in the 
company. No immediate changes in employment and production are 
therefore to be expected, the head of the concern, Sven-Erik 
Zachrisson promises. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has called on Syria to help bring about "general 
restraint" following the Hebron massacre. During talks in Bonn 
with his Syrian counterpart Faruq al-Shar', Kinkel said that an 
act of terror carried out by one Israeli extremist could not be 
allowed to bury the prospects for peace and stability in the 
Middle East in the long term. 
  Syria should resume its bilateral talks with Israel as well 
as take part in the multilateral negotiations. The German 
Government was ready to help stabilize the situation by giving 
reconstruction aid to Palestinian areas and Lebanon as well as 
to support an international presence if necessary. The German 
Foreign Ministry says the Syrian foreign minister stressed that 
his country has taken a constructive position regarding the 
Middle East peace process.

regarding Kinkel's visit to Paris on 24 March. Reports on 
alleged anxious remarks by French Ambassador Francois Scheer on 
Franco-German relations were devoid of any foundation. 
  Scheer met Dieter Kastrup, state secretary in the Foreign 
Ministry, this morning. According to media reports there was 
annoyance in Bonn about Scheer's remarks. Speaking to foreign 
correspondents in Bonn, Scheer had, among other things, called 
for closer cooperation between France and Germany in the 
expansion of the European Union.

<F P=106> [Nevenka Mitrevska report: "Europeanization of the Greek </F>
Blockade"] 
  [Text] Bonn, 16 Mar -- The Greek embargo and its possible 
consequences for the stability of The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia [FYROM] and the whole region dominated the 
discussions of President Kiro Gligorov during his meetings on 
the second day of his working visit to the Federal Republic of 
Germany. The FYROM president talked about that and about the 
need for "Europeanization" with Mr. Karl Lammers, coordinator of 
the parliamentary group of Christian Democratic Union; with Bonn 
Mayor Hans Daniels; and also at lunch with former FRGB Foreign 
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Finally he had a two-hour 
meeting with over 100 German and foreign journalists accredited 
in Bonn. The German open disapproval of the latest act of the 
government in Athens against FYROM was reaffirmed at every step. 
  "FYROM has played a significant, even a historical role in 
safeguarding stability and peace in the south of the Balkans, 
therefore also in Europe, which commits the European Union to 
help FYROM in every way. This time Europe must not back down 
and be in delay, as it did with Bosnia," Mr. Genscher said 
during the lunch he had with President Gligorov. 
<H5>  Nothing Can Be Solved With Pressure </H5>
  The meeting between Gligorov and Genscher was initiated by 
Genscher. The FYROM president described it as "very fruitful 
and pleasant." Hans-Dietrich Genscher is not occupying an 
official position at this moment; he is engaged in strategic 
studies, but he is still considered as one of the current 
architects of foreign policy in Germany. Therefore his 
"recommendation" for Europeanization of the Greek blockade 
against FYROM was not his private opinion. 
  That was also confirmed by Karl Lammers, the coordinator of 
the parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic Union, with 
whom President Gligorov started his working day. "The stance of 
Germany and the European Union is that Greece must lift the 
blockade immediately, because it does not coincide with the 
principles of the Union, and not only affects the border with 
Greece, but also the border of the European Union with a 
neighboring country. I hope Greece will find a way to remove 
this measure because it cannot use it to force the neighboring 
country to anything," Mr. Lammers said at the end of the 
discussions he had with President Gligorov. His assessment was 
that the question of the blockade should be solved by the 
Europeans, and not by the big powers, in order to avoid new 
divisions, according to what he stated. 
<H5>  The Reasonable Ones Talk, They Do Not Threaten </H5>
  Another Greek characteristic during this visit of President 
Gligorov, as has been the case with all his journeys in the past 
two to three years, was the great number of Greek journalists 
who followed him everywhere. They waited for him at the hotel, 
at the residential houses and offices where he talked with his 
hosts, they photographed him and repeatedly asked: Will FYROM 
give up its flag so that Greece may remove the measures? The 
Greeks were the most numerous, or at least the most intrusive at 
today's news conference held by President Gligorov in Bonn. 
  Why does the FYROM insist on solving the dispute with Greece 
in a "basket," and not issue by issue? Will Germany come out as 
a new mediator in the FYROM-Greek dispute? What concessions is 
FYROM ready to make? Is not the alternative road East-West not 
an attempt to secede from Greece? 
  President Gligorov replied: "We had separate discussions, 
one 
question after the other. However, two years have passed. 
Finally we must gather our courage, sit at a negotiating table, 
and find solutions for the whole dispute in a basket. The 
reasonable ones talk, they do not threaten." President Gligorov 
also emphasized that FYROM and Greece, both being members of the 
United Nations, are committed by a resolution to solve their 
dispute. 
  "FYROM will suffer great damages with the embargo," Gligorov 
said, "but so will Greece. Finally, we shall survive, but I 
don't know if the fact that we shall have damages will help 
Greece." 
  Asked about his opinion on the results of last week's start 
of FYROM-Greek negotiations in Geneva, President Gligorov said 
that "they are modest, but they clearly demonstrate that the 
place to negotiate is in the United Nations. Two UN members 
must respect the resolution adopted by the United Nations. We 
are immediately ready to resume the negotiations, however not 
under the embargo conditions and with a rope around the neck, 
because it is not an equal and dignified position," President 
Kiro Gligorov said at the news conference in Bonn.

<F P=106> ["for"-signed report: "Labor Minister Opposed to Early </F>
Retirement"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- Labor Minister Norbert Bluem (Christian 
Democratic Union) has defended the G-7 Jobs Conference in 
Detroit. The meeting of labor, finance, and economics ministers 
of the seven major industrial nations has clearly improved 
conditions for harmonizing labor market initiatives. In view of 
the practices adopted by multinational trusts, control of the 
labor market and of job developments can no longer be an 
exclusively national task. 
  The German Trade Union Federation had accused the government 
of taking a defendant's position in Detroit. The Federal 
Republic was the only participant that did not create a new 
stimulus for economic recovery, and it was criticized for this. 
Speaking to correspondents, Bluem said that the Detroit talks 
had determined fields of action that would not have become 
visible without this joint initiative. Against the background 
of big trusts' international employment policies labor policy 
needs find new solutions. The labor market, which has become 
disordered, can no longer be controlled by individual national 
initiatives alone. 
<H5>  New Qualifications </H5>
  The Federal Republic does quite well in international labor 
market comparisons. Germany continues to come out on top as far 
as vocational qualifications are concerned. In addition, 
Germany is the only country besides Japan where unemployment 
among young people is below the average unemployment rate. This 
development is a success of the dual system of vocational 
training, Bluem said. Qualifications are also the key factor for 
a successful implementation of labor market initiatives. 
  With the existing labor market situation, original training 
is no longer the most important thing, but new qualifications 
must be acquired, the minister said. Employees have good 
opportunities if "they keep abreast with new developments in 
their jobs." 
  Referring to Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social 
Union), who said in Detroit that certain inflexibilities still 
have to be overcome in Germany following reunification, the 
minister called upon companies and trade unions to give up their 
inflexible positions with regard to working hours and to find 
new and creative solutions and models. There are no legal 
obstacles preventing this. It is high time to agree on 
"tailor-made individual working hours." 
  On a critical note, Bluem said that the entire transport 
infrastructure accounts for German industry and administration 
structures that hardly allow for any variations in working 
hours, with work beginning early in the morning. In Germany, 
everything is organized by the "march in review" principle. The 
Federal Republic would have an additional 2 million people 
working if it adopted the part-time regulations common in The 
Netherlands. 
  Another unresolved problem is the employment of older 
people, 
Bluem said. There are cultural and social reasons clearly 
speaking against early retirement of older people, but they 
should be offered flexible opportunities for employment instead. 
The policy adopted by many companies that laid off older people 
turned out to be a mistake. The recent development with entire 
sectors, such as steel or mining, hardly having any workers that 
are older than 50 "must be counteracted." 
<H5>  "Vigorous Statements" </H5>
  This has also been proven by several analyses that U.S. 
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich presented in Detroit. The 
minister said self-critically that "earlier vigorous Bluem 
statements," with which he had spoken out for many people making 
use of the early retirement scheme, are no longer up to date.

  [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis 
met this afternoon with Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis as 
part of his contacts with the Cyprus Government to promote the 
implementation of the unified defense doctrine between Greece 
and Cyprus. In a statement after the meeting, which took place 
at the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that 
Arsenis' visit shows that the political decisions of the Greek 
and Cypriot governments are being implemented. Arsenis did not 
make a statement. 
  This morning the Greek minister of national defense visited 
the National Guard General Staff [YEEF], where with Cypriot 
Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis, he chaired a meeting. 
The meeting was attended by the Greek ambassador, members of 
Arsenis' entourage, the National Guard chief and high-ranking 
officers of the National Guard. Before the meeting at the YEEF, 
Arsenis and Iliadhis had a private meeting. 
  Speaking at the Defense Ministry, Arsenis stressed that the 
joint defense doctrine is not new. He said that it was used 
even by Kimon [ancient Greek general] and this proves that even 
in the days of the trireme Hellenism was projected in the 
creation of Greek wonders. He also said that today, with modern 
means of communications, distance has disappeared and we are 
close, very close. Hellenism's soul, he stressed, is one. 
Arsenis said that serious preparations have been made, and 
expressed the conviction that by the end of the day we will 
achieve everything we desire.

  [Text] Ankara, Mar. 17 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet 
Cetin flew to Washington D.C. today, to take part in Friday's 
[17 March] signing ceremony between Bosnian Muslims and Croats. 
  In a statement at the airport before his departure, Cetin 
said that Turkey welcomed this step taken by Bosnians and Croats 
and hoped that real peace comes to Bosnia-Herzegovina when Serbs 
join this process too. 
  "Turkey is ready to contribute to the UN Forces in the 
region, for a lasting, equitable peace," Cetin said. 
  "Turkey, which has the confidence of both Croats and 
Bosnians, will continue contributing actively to the peace 
process in the region," he said. 
  Cetin added that the ceremony, to which he was invited by 
his 
American counterpart Warren Christopher, showed once more the 
importance and weight of Turkey in the Balkans. 
  On Turkey's proposal to join the UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces] in the region, Cetin said that French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe, who was visiting Turkey, said that his 
country did not oppose this initiative. 
  Evaluating Juppe's visit, Cetin said that the French 
Government was not displaying a disturbing stand toward Turkey 
and was very careful in not intervening in Turkey's internal 
affairs. 
  Cetin will proceed from Washington to New York and will 
return home on March 20.

  [Text] Our policy on the issue of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is firmly set out, and will 
produce the expected results, said Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreou today. The prime minister was replying to 
correspondents' questions as he left the Chamber of Deputies 
where Greece's 150 years of parliamentary life was celebrated. 
  Replying to a question on whether he believes that the many 
open fronts and dangers around us could develop into unfortunate 
situations for our region, Papandreou said he does not think 
anything like this could happen. If we have our eyes open and 
are united with a common goal to protect the nation and our 
people, he said, I think we can overcome all difficulties. 
Responding to another question on whether he feels that some 
are trying to increase the tension in the region with the topic 
of the Turkish troops' participation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Papandreou said: There are always circles who seek division, 
disorientation and promotion of their own interests, but I do 
not think they will succeed in their mission. Replying to 
another question, Papandreou said that our democracy has been 
sheltered long enough to face the problems in our country now.

  [Text] Vienna, March 21 KYODO -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) convened a meeting Monday [21 March] in 
Vienna of its Board of Governors to discuss North Korea's 
refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to make a full inspection of 
its nuclear facilities. 
  The Board of Governors will hear a report from IAEA Director 
General Hans Blix about the inspection work by a group of 
inspectors on North Korean facilities but North Korea threatened 
Monday to quit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). A 
North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that 
Pyongyang has "no alternative" but to (?reactivate) 1993 
decision to leave the international pact on the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog body is expected to pass a 
resolution that will refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the 
U.N. Security Council, Agency sources said. 
  If the matter is referred, the Security Council may discuss 
possible economic sanctions against North Korea, the sources 
said. 
  China, one of the five permanent members on the Security 
Council, may oppose any tough action against North Korea with 
which Beijing has maintained close relations, they said. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, during weekend 
meetings with Chinese Premier Li Peng, voiced grave concern over 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, saying 
the international community's patience is nearing its limit. 
  Li told Hosokawa that the international community should try 
to solve the problem through patient negotiations. 
  Li also said it is important to give North Korea "what it 
needs." The Chinese premier, however, did not specify what North 
Korea needs. 
  A group of IAEA nuclear experts returned from North Korea 
earlier this month after being unable to verify whether nuclear 
material had been diverted from a radiochemical laboratory in 
Yongbyon, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang. 
  Amid mounting tensions on the Korean peninsula over North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development program, the United States 
and South Korea are moving toward resuming the Team Spirit 
military exercises. 
  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam instructed his ministers 
Monday to consult with the United States about when to hold the 
Team Spirit military exercise, Presidential Press Secretary Chu 
Ton-sik said. 
  Seoul's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported South Korea and the U.S. 
plan to deploy Patriot air defense missiles at U.S. military 
bases in South Korea next month.

  [Text] Brussels -- The two-day International Conference on 
North Kurdistan [Kurdish regions in Turkey] held in the Belgian 
capital has ended with a 31-point resolution. 
  The resolution announced at the end of the conference calls 
for the recognition of the Kurds as a separate people and for 
the reflection of this fact primarily in the [Turkish] 
Constitution and in all other legislative acts. 
  The members of parliament taking part in the conference 
issued a separate eight-point resolution of their own. 
  The conference called for the convocation of an 
international 
conference in Diyarbakir to review the developments following 
the broad dissemination of its resolution and of Ocalan's 
[leader of the Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK] proposals. 
  The members of parliament taking part in the conference 
adopted an eight-point separate resolution of their own. This 
resolution, adopted by 27 MP's from the Turkish and various 
other parliaments, says: 
  ``1. The conference strongly protests the lifting of the 
immunity of the Kurdish members of parliament by the Turkish 
Grand National Assembly [TGNA], and the detention of some of 
them. 
  ``2. The immunity of all TGNA members must be restored 
immediately. The conference calls on all TGNA members to 
implement the normal laws and forge a parliamentary compromise. 
  ``3. The conference advocates the recognition and 
legalization of all Kurdish parties. 
  ``4. For this purpose, a dialogue should be initiated in 
Parliament with the Government. 
  ``5. All arms exports to Turkey outside its NATO commitments 
should stop. 
  ``6. NATO should revise its arms exports to Turkey. The 
violation of the Kurds' legitimate rights with the use of NATO 
arms is unacceptable. 
  ``7. The CSCE countries must immediately put into effect a 
mechanism to ensure Turkey's compliance with human rights 
standards in keeping with its international commitments. 
  ``8. All governments will be asked to intensify their formal 
relations with the DEP [Democracy Party] and to take appropriate 
measures to help that party.'' 
  The following are some of the points of the general 
resolution adopted at the end of the conference: [First two 
points not published] 
  ``3. The roots of the present situation faced by the Kurdish 
and Turkish peoples lie in the period when the Ottoman Empire 
was being dissolved and in the aftermath of World War I, in 
which Europe was also involved. Therefore, this is also a 
European problem. 
  ``It is now time for Europe to fulfill its responsibilities. 
It must help the Kurdish and Turkish peoples, and assume its 
responsibilities for achieving a peaceful, democratic solution 
through a dialogue suitable to the interests of the Turkish and 
Kurdish peoples. 
  ``4. There are still human rights violations in Turkey, most 
of the victims being Kurds and defenders of human rights. 
  ``5. Germany and the United States in particular are 
providing military support to Turkey in order to prolong the 
fighting. These arms are being used in major violations of 
human rights and in crimes against mankind. 
  ``6. The term `terrorism' implies individual acts inspiring 
terror. This term is being manipulated and is misused in order 
to legitimize the transfer of arms used in military operations 
against the organized armed group fighting against the Turkish 
state. The states providing these arms are also misusing the 
concept of terrorism. 
  ``7. In order to be able to fulfill their legitimate 
international commitments, the United States and all the 
European States should completely cut off military and economic 
assistance to Turkey until it fully implements its commitments 
to legality and human rights. 
  ``8. Turkey should institute democratic restructuring to 
bring peace and security to the country as a whole. The 
security of all the peoples in Turkey is contingent upon the 
definition and recognition of the Kurdish people as a separate 
people. The recognition of the Kurdish people should be 
guaranteed constitutionally. Turkey's Constitution and all the 
legislative acts must fully guarantee the Kurdish people's 
cultural, social, and political rights. 
  ``9. A democratic dialogue should be started. Preconditions 
for this are a mutual cease-fire with international supervision, 
the lifting of all bans on Kurdish organizations, and the legal 
recognition of the right to use the Kurdish language. The 
Kurdish people's freedom to take part in a dialogue on their 
future through their organizations, including that of the PKK, 
must be guaranteed. 
  ``10. If a genuine dialogue is to be launched in Turkey, 
then freedom of expression and the press must be fully 
recognized. 
  ``11. Turkey must chose one of two paths: The first is the 
current ever increasing militarization of the state at the cost 
of the sacrifice of the democratic traditions. This path will 
lead to isolation and detachment from European institutions, 
including the Council of Europe, and to the destruction of 
democracy and the economy. The other is a path that makes it 
possible to defend the fundamental rights and freedoms of both 
the Kurds and Turks. This path is the foundation for a 
democratic dialogue. 
  ``12. The international community, particularly the European 
states, are obligated to help Turkey to chose the path of a 
peaceful and secure future in conformity with UN Charter and its 
commitments within the CSCE. For this reason, they should help 
the Kurds in their countries to participate in the dialogue. 
This requires the lifting of restrictions and bans imposed on 
the Kurdish organizations in France and Germany. These states 
must begin a dialogue with the Kurdish people's representatives, 
including the PKK's. 
  ``13. In the light of the PKK general secretary's proposal 
for a mutual cease-fire under international supervision, Turkey 
must utilize the opportunity for a new democratic solution to 
the Kurdish problem. The international community must encourage 
Turkey to utilize this opportunity. If Turkey does not utilize 
this opportunity immediately and in a positive manner, then the 
international community must act to protect the rights of the 
Kurdish people. 
  ``20. [Number as published] All CSCE member countries: 
  ``-- must ensure that the CSCE High Commission on Minorities 
fully fulfills its functions in Turkey, and 
  ``-- appoint observers to monitor the local elections in 
southeast Turkey and the situation in the region over a longer 
period. 
  ``21. It is the obligation of the member countries of the 
Council of Europe to impose international sanctions against 
Turkey in accordance with Article 24 of the European Human 
Rights Convention in order to prevent further deterioration of 
the situation and in connection with official excuses over 
violations of the provisions of the convention. 
  ``22. The political parties should strengthen their formal 
ties with the Kurdish and Turkish parties, especially the DEP 
[Democracy Party]. 
  ``26. [number as published] This International Conference 
makes the following demands from the Turkish Government: 
  ``-- That it urgently reply to the proposal for a mutual 
cease-fire under the supervision of international observers. 
  ``-- That it restore the immunity of the eight deputies, and 
release the detained ones. 
  ``-- That it put an end to the killing of the party members 
and leaders, the bombing of party headquarters, and mass 
detentions. 
  ``-- That it rescind the Antiterrorism Law, and lift the 
legal and administrative restrictions on the Kurdish 
organizations. 
  ``-- That it put an end to the killing, detention, 
intimidation of reporters, and to the intervention in press 
freedom. 
  ``-- That it create democratic conditions for the next 
elections. 
  ``-- As an initial move, that it give permission to a 
broadly 
based group of international observers to monitor the March 
1994 elections, and facilitate the monitoring of Nevruz 
celebrations by governmental and nongovernmental observers. 
  ``27. The Conference calls on the organizers of this 
historic conference to widely circulate these decisions and the 
PKK secretary general's message to the conference. 
  ``28. The conference calls on its organizers to sponsor 
activities for effective implementation of the proposals to 
Turkey, other states, and the PKK. 
  ``29. The conference approves of any measures aimed at 
enhancing international interest in the situation in Kurdistan, 
including the sending of fact-finding delegations. 
  ``30. The conference calls on its organizers to consider 
calling an international conference in Diyarbakir to review the 
developments. 
  ``31. The conference calls on Turkish, Kurdish, and 
international media to continue their important role of 
thoroughly reporting on the situation in Kurdistan, and 
concludes its meeting with hopes of a new democratic future for 
the region.''

<F P=106> [Ylva Nilsson report: "EU Wants To See a Referendum First"] </F>
  [Text] Brussels -- The Swedish political parties' headache 
over when the Swedish referendum should be held is not being 
made any easier by the fact that the EU [European Union] side 
must also be brought into the picture if Sweden is to be able to 
meet the timetable and become a member on 1 January 1995. 
  The national parliaments of the EU countries also have to 
approve Sweden as a new member, and in several countries over 
six months are needed to get through the formal procedures. 
  Having EU candidates Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria 
approved in the EU countries' national parliaments is not likely 
to cause political problems, and all twelve are likely to say 
"yes." However, one complication could be that a country or 
countries could want first to see a "yes" from the referendums 
in the new countries before reaching a decision on the matter. 
  "For some countries the issue is a sensitive one. In 1972 
governments asked their parliaments to approve Norway as a new 
member and then the Norwegian people voted `no.' Not everyone 
has the inclination to expose themselves to that embarrassment 
again, but wants to see the referendum result first," an EU 
diplomat in Brussels said. 
  If the Bildt government launches Operation Persuasion in the 
EU capitals, this risk could perhaps be eliminated and the 
twelve governments could ask their parliaments to begin 
consideration of the matter before the referendums in order to 
be able to complete the process quickly for those countries 
where the people vote "yes." On the other hand no one can start 
work until the EU's own parliament has said "yes." This could 
happen in May this year at the earliest, but it is uncertain 
whether the European Parliament is able or willing to keep to 
this timetable. 
  A subsequent problem could be the fact that parliamentary 
procedure in certain countries is relatively detailed. In the 
Netherlands and Britain, for example, a bill passes from the 
lower chamber to the upper chamber and is then passed back to 
the lower chamber again. 
  In Spain procedures normally take six months and the 
government has to request speedy treatment if things are to move 
more quickly. 
  "The quickest the countries have ever ratified an EU 
agreement is seven months," EU Commissioner Henning 
Christophersen said when the EEA [European Economic Area] 
agreement was under discussion. 
  The EEA agreement, which has been approved by all the 
governments involved, did indeed take the EU countries seven 
months to ratify. Despite its popularity, the Maastricht Treaty 
took seven months to ratify in Belgium. In Italy, another 
country which welcomed the treaty, it took eight months. The 
Netherlands -- also pro-Maastricht -- needed six months.

<F P=106> [Robert Shrimsley report: "Major Told To Stand Firm Over EC </F>
Voting"] 
  [Text] Mr Major was told last night that he should 
surrender his plans for enlargement of the European Community 
rather than weaken Britain's power to block unwanted legislation 
from Brussels. 
  As Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, prepares for a 
key 
meeting in Brussels tomorrow to thrash out a deal on the voting 
rights row, he faced growing demands from traditional loyalists 
as well as the Right wing of the party to resist compromising. 
  Such views were echoed yesterday by Mr Michael Portillo, 
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who said the British people did 
not want to be "swept along" by the rising European tide. 
Senior party sources predicted that Mr Major would contact Mr 
Kohl, the German Chancellor, before tomorrow's meeting to urge 
him to come to Britain's aid. 
  Other EC nations insist that the four new recruits, Austria, 
Norway, Sweden and Finland, can be allowed to join only if 
Britain accepts that the number of votes needed to block new 
legislation must rise accordingly, from 23 votes to 27. 
  They argue that the blocking majority has always been 30 
percent of the votes, and with four new members that 
necessitates a rise from 23 to 27. This would mean that Britain 
could no longer count on blocking new laws with the support of 
just one other large nation and one smaller one. 
  A fourth nation would now be needed for a veto under the 
Qualified Majority Voting system. EC leaders said yesterday 
that Britain would have to compromise if it wanted enlargement, 
a policy Britain has championed, to be approved . 
  Mr Leo Tindemans, President of the European People's Party, 
said the European Parliament, which has to approve the new 
rules, would "never accept" enlargement unless the required 
majority was increased to 27. However, the Government's room 
for manoeuvre seems limited. A growing number of MPs not 
traditionally identified as Euro-rebels say a compromise would 
be difficult to accept . 
  A Conservative Central Office survey of Tory activists 
showed 
a majority of three to one against reducing British powers and a 
majority actually in favour of increasing them. 
  Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, said on BBC's On 
the 
Record, that if Britain held firm, enlargement would not be 
sacrificed, "it would merely be a postponement." Mr David 
Howell, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, added 
that with the greater volume of legislation from Brussels the 
voting threshold should actually be tightened, "to prevent this 
unwelcome volume of measures being pushed on unwilling 
minorities." 
  Even Sir Peter Hordern, the staunchly loyal head of the 
backbench European Affairs Committee, said the situation had to 
remain where two major countries could effectively block 
legislation. The compromise cooling-off period of one or two 
months was "neither here nor there." 
  Mr Portillo, speaking on the BBC's Frost programme, said he 
did not believe enlargement was in danger because all member 
countries saw it as a "great prize." The idea "that this whole 
thing is going to sink on British obduracy is really an 
invention," he added. 
  The Government had never considered enlargement "as being a 
reduction of each country's power and each country's weight." 
  The Government's difficulties were played up by Mr John 
Smith, the Labour Leader, in a speech in Birmingham yesterday, 
when he said the Tories, with "their narrow vision and low 
ambition for the country," were sacrificing British interests 
for the sake of party unity. 
  The Government's posturing was a political manoeuvre "to 
keep 
the Tory Euro-sceptics happy."

  [Text] Peter Baumann, the 54-year-old head of department at 
the Agriculture Ministry, has been appointed to head the Danish 
EU [European Union] Directorate, Socialist Prime Minister Poul 
Nyrup Rasmussen announced yesterday. 
  The EU Directorate administers EU funds worth between 11 and 
12 billion kroner each year. Peter Baumann will take up his new 
post on 15 April. He will take charge of 240 employees 
following the recent recruitment of 38 extra staff in the EU 
directorate, among other things with a view to coping with the 
hectare grants. 
  After graduating in law from Copenhagen University in 1965, 
Peter Baumann was a practicing attorney for seven years and 
taught public law at Copenhagen University. 
  In 1974, he moved to Brussels where for three years he 
served 
as an adviser within the European Commission's legal department. 
In 1977-1980 he was deputy cabinet head for Danish Commissioner 
Finn Gundelach. In 1980, Peter Baumann returned to the Danish 
Agriculture Ministry. After six years as office chief, he 
served as a commissioner within the Ministry for three years 
before becoming head of department in 1990.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by an </F>
unidentified KURIER reporter "on the flight to Washington": 
"Mock: `I See Light at the End of the Tunnel'"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] Does today's signing of the agreement 
[between Bosnian Muslims and Croats] give you personal 
satisfaction? 
  [Mock] Absolutely. The agreement is a very positive 
beginning. It ensures the credibility of international 
involvement. And if it is now possible to expand the security 
zones -- which has always been our main concern -- the killing 
of the civilian population in Bosnia will stop. However, one 
cannot yet speak of an overall solution. Just the question of 
cantons in the Muslim- Croatian federation alone is a sensitive 
issue -- not to speak of a global solution for Yugoslavia's 
successor states. However, at least it's a start. 
  [KURIER] Is this primarily at the instigation of the United 
States? 
  [Mock] The United States is so deeply involved that it will 
no longer be as easy as it was in the past for the warring 
parties to turn away. The United States has accepted a clear 
responsibility. And if cooperation with the European Union 
troika and with France, which is particularly active in Bosnia, 
is now intensified, I finally see light at the end of a long 
tunnel. 
  [KURIER] Will the Serbs make compromises? 
  [Mock] If they reject the Muslim-Croat union, this is their 
business. But one must ask them. 
  [KURIER] Do you see the involvement of Russia and the United 
States as a staking out of their spheres of influence in the 
Balkans? 
  [Mock] If the former parade themselves as the protectors of 
one side and the latter as protectors of the other side, I do 
not think much of that. This would be like the antiquated 
great-power policy of the 19th century. But in the case of 
Sarajevo the Russians have been very constructive. 
  [KURIER] Do you think that economic cooperation of the 
warring parties in ex-Yugoslavia will be possible at some time 
in the future? 
  [Mock] The trend toward integration will gain ground in 
Central Europe and also in the Balkans. But that will take a 
long time.

<F P=106> [Report signed "A.An.": "Haider: European Treaty Is </F>
Precondition for Agreement to EU"] 
  [Text] There has been movement in the debate about Europe. 
Great Britain might be willing to give in concerning the 
contentious issue of the blocking minority for European Union 
[EU] decisions. So far, the final conclusion of the membership 
negotiations has failed because of disagreement on this issue. 
  The issue of European integration was also the focal issue 
at 
a meeting of the Federal Executive Committee of the Freedom 
Party of Austria [FPOe] in Salzburg on Saturday [19 March]. The 
marathon debate took more than six hours. In the course of this 
discussion the FPOe made a clear change in its EU policy. Until 
then rejection of EU membership had dominated. Now the FPOe has 
become more positive toward the EU. 
  A precondition for a recommendation to vote yes [in the 
referendum on EU membership] is the conclusion of a European 
treaty between the government and the opposition, FPOe Chairman 
Joerg Haider stressed. "In view of the existing results of the 
negotiations, which are known only very rudimentarily, it is all 
the more necessary to critically ask whether the necessary 
homework has been done." 
  Over the past few days, EU advocates in the FPOe have spoken 
up more loudly. In the diet elections [in Salzburg, Tirol, and 
Carinthia on 13 March], polls showed that half of FPOe voters 
are positively inclined toward the EU. 
  The European treaty is to set down the fulfillment of 
several 
demands within a precise timeframe. Among other things, Haider 
is demanding a constitutional safeguarding of direct payments to 
farmers and tax reform to protect small and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  The invitation to Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian 
People's Party) and State Secretary Brigitte Ederer (Social 
Democratic Party of Austria) to brief the FPOe about the results 
of the EU negotiations is still open.

<F P=106> [Article signed S.M.: "Competitive Position Deteriorates </F>
Further"] 
  [Text] Despite the measures taken under the crisis plan, 
the competitiveness of Belgian companies will further 
deteriorate this year. That emerged from calculations by the 
research department of the Kredietbank. In 1994 wages will 
increase in Belgium 0.6 percent quicker than in its five most 
important trading partners, expressed in a single currency. In 
1995 there will be a slight improvement, according to the report. 
  Toward the end of the month the CRB [Central Council for 
Industry] will again issue an opinion on how the competitiveness 
of Belgian companies is developing. The CRB will base itself on 
the figures of the OECD. The Kredietbank has already calculated 
the conclusions which the CRB will reach. 
  From the calculations it appears that company 
competitiveness 
is further deteriorating in 1994, despite wage restraint and 
other measures in the Dehaene government's crisis plan. The 
explanation is simple: Belgium's trading partners are also 
making an effort to keep down wages. In addition, the Belgian 
franc -- after weakening in the fourth quarter of 1993 -- has 
once again increased in value. 
  The result is that Belgium's competitive disadvantage in 
wage 
costs compared to its five major trading partners (Germany, 
France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Italy) will increase 
in 1994 from 4.1 percent to 4.9 percent. Compared with 
Belgium's seven biggest trading partners (the five plus the 
United States and Japan). The competitive disadvantage will 
increase from 4.7 percent to 5.3 percent. 
  Assuming that the franc's exchange rate remains stable in 
1994 and 1995, then the competitive disadvantage should decline 
in 1995 to around the 1993 level. 
  The end of the tunnel as regards the restoration of 
Belgium's 
competitive position was not yet in sight, the Kredietbank's 
research department concluded. 
  However, it is possible that the CRB figures will differ 
from 
the Kredietbank's. The discussion between trade unions and 
employers within the CRB concerns the very question of the 
impact of the crisis plan on wage developments in Belgium.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economic Affairs Minister Jacobus Andriessen </F>
by Cees Banning in The Hague; date not given: "Andriessen: `Let 
Us Go For It'"] 
  [Excerpts] Today the eight working papers which make up the 
agenda for the "globalization forum," i.e., Economic Affairs 
Minister Andriessen's conference on the Netherlands' competitive 
position, were published. "I was afraid of a litany of 
complaining business people." Following is an interview with 
Minister Andriessen about the "Let us do it" feeling. 
  The Netherlands economy needs a thorough review, although 
there is no reason for pessimism. According to Economic Affairs 
Minister Andriessen, the sense of urgency arises 
because one out of five companies is considering transferring 
more activities abroad. "Fortunately, considering and acting 
are not always synonymous. But when it does happen, jobs are 
lost." 
  With his economic pamphlet "Globalization: A Genuine Trend," 
Andriessen set the tone for discussing competition from low wage 
countries. During the discussion of the economic budget, 
Andriessen's message appeared to have brought results: The 
parliamentarians decided to use a traditional parliamentary 
instrument to tackle the "new" subject intelligently: research." 
[passage omitted] 
  To prepare the globalization forum eight workshops were 
organized last month bringing together businessmen, scientists, 
and civil servants. Apart from three general themes (innovative 
entrepreneurship, technology, and employment) five other 
workshops focused on chemistry, the food industry, financial 
services, the metal and electrotechnical industry, and 
logistical support. On Andriessen's desk are the proceedings of 
the discussions. [passage omitted] 
  The man who is to form a new government will be informed 
about the results of the "globalization forum." After a four 
year term in the government, the minister sees "a major battle 
between salary and income. We constantly have the tendency to 
look at our income only. Labor -- and more specifically the 
creation of new jobs -- is being neglected, although it is the 
basis of the work distribution problem. This was my hidden 
agenda for the strategic conference." 
  [Banning] The diagnosis is well-known: a lack of 
flexibility. 
What does the therapy look like? 
  [Andriessen] Entrepreneurs, employees, and the authorities 
are not flexible enough. That cannot be denied. However, we 
should not get stuck in passing the buck. Entrepreneurs often 
speak of the inflexibility of the labor market, but they forget 
that in the area of innovation they themselves are not flexible 
enough. 
  The government's flexibility should go hand in hand with a 
reduction of rules and legislation. [passage omitted] 
  We calculated that each year 400 new industry-related rules 
are added. The cost of this kind of legislation for businesses 
totals around 8 billion guilders per year. I am planning to 
make an index of the cost for industry of all regulations and 
laws. In the coming government term, this index should be 
reduced from 100 to say 90. 
  Employees should be prepared for more flexible working 
relations. Entrepreneurs are afraid of labor. DAF, for example, 
is building trucks only on the basis of actual orders and not 
extra trucks for stock. This might result in a tremendous 
savings in labor costs, but in that case you must be able to 
produce more trucks in times of growing demand. This requires 
flexible working relations. In day-to-day labor relations, too, 
greater flexibility is needed. 
  [Banning] Institutional obstacles that you are referring to, 
such as working hours, can best be removed in times of economic 
recession. As Philips Chairman Timmer put it: "Change your 
organization: Create a crisis." 
  [Andriessen] I hope to avoid this kind of philosophy. The 
economy seems to be picking up, with 2.5 percent growth 
recorded. However, the structural problem is not automatically 
solved when the economy picks up. After each economic 
recession, less people are working in the major enterprises. To 
create more jobs, we need small enterprises. 
  [Banning] The Netherlands has many small enterprises, but 
relatively few continuously growing companies. Among 
entrepreneurs there seems to be a spirit of laziness, apathy. 
  [Andriessen] Compared with other countries, we have a good 
scorecard regarding start-ups, averaging 20,000 to 25,000 a 
year. However, many entrepreneurs are not adequately prepared, 
with poorly developed marketing plans and disorganized 
administrations. In these matters the authorities can be of 
help. But the biggest problem is growth, i.e., taking the steps 
that will lead from 10 to 100 employees. 
  In this respect, mentality is important. The Netherlands is 
reluctant to take risks. We had too easy a life in the past. 
Entrepreneurs will have to take up the challenge themselves; 
globalization also creates a lot of opportunities. 
  [Banning] The recurring theme of your economic pamphlet is 
the reorganization of the welfare state. But is reorganization 
sufficient to regain competitiveness. 
  [Andriessen] It is only one element. I am not saying that 
salaries in the Netherlands are too high. We should not compete 
with countries like Poland in salary matters; this is nonsense. 
The welfare state has an impact on labor costs. However, I 
want to avoid having the discussion boil down to a lament about 
social security. All election platforms dedicate a lot of 
attention to it. That subject is already under discussion. 
  In order to regain competitiveness the government can make 
its contribution by creating an appropriate entrepreneurial 
climate. There is a threat that the Netherlands' infrastructure 
will deteriorate. This government has given a strong impetus to 
improving the infrastructure: the Betuwe railway, high-speed 
train lines, Schiphol airport. Such projects also have a 
stimulating function: the "let us do it" feeling. 
  [Banning] On 24 March you will attempt to change the 
Netherlands' national character to accept globalization. 
However, when you look at the cabinet's painful discussion 
about ensuring a 1 percent yearly increase in consumer 
purchasing power, would you not rather have to deal first with 
your colleagues in the cabinet? 
  [Andriessen] I am playing a role in the ministerial council. 
The council mainly has a distributive task. We do not 
manufacture anything. We are no entrepreneurs. However, we do 
decide on 50 percent of the budget. I regularly emphasize the 
fact that we first have to earn money before we can distribute 
some. That is the "sense of urgency."

<F P=106> [By David Mason and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister John Major flew into Sarajevo today 
and announced a 12 million pound package of immediate aid for 
war-torn Bosnia. 
  The deal includes 5 million pounds of direct aid to get key 
public services running in Sarajevo and 7 million pounds to 
support international aid agencies working throughout Bosnia. 
  Overseas Aid Minister Lady Chalker, who has just completed a 
four-day review of British aid to Bosnia, said: "It's 
pump-priming, it's paving the way for reconstruction. The whole 
package of aid can help us get started on the reconstruction, 
whether it's basic engineering for water and power, basic 
infrastructure, mending bridges or basic medical." 
  Mr Major, accompanied on his first trip to the Bosnian 
capital by Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, was met at the 
airport by Lady Chalker and British UN Commander Lieutenant 
General Sir Michael Rose. 
  They drove to General Rose's residence for talks through 
streets which have come to life beneath the battle-scarred 
buildings during the month-old ceasefire. Mr Major and General 
Rose went on to meet Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic to 
discuss the peace process and the city's vital reconstruction 
needs. 
  As they were holding talks at the presidency the boom from 
an 
artillery round echoed over the city, one of numerous minor 
breaches of the ceasefire. 
  Mr Major was later visiting the city's central water pumping 
station to meet British emergency aid engineers working to 
repair and maintain water supplies, heating systems, power 
distribution, sanitation and other key services over a wide area 
of central Bosnia. 
  Their work provides a model for the Anglo-American 
initiative 
to get the city on its feet again which Mr Major and President 
Clinton announced when the Prime Minister visited Washington 
earlier this month. 
  While Mr Major was meeting Mr Ganic, Lady Chalker and Mr 
Rifkind set off to visit the 70-strong Royal Artillery troop 
manning the Cymbeline mortar-locating radar battery brought in 
by General Rose to monitor breaches of the ceasefire.

  [Text] The Government is blocking the path to peace in 
Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams claimed today. 
Downing Street's attitude was the major obstacle to ending the 
current impasse, he said. The process required flexibility and 
imagination, but the comments of John Major and other Ministers 
suggested those qualities were lacking in Government circles. 
  Mr. Adams said: "Rather than seeking to remove the 
roadblocks on the road to peace, Mr. Major and his collegues 
appear determined to erect more." He welcomed President 
Clinton's "positive and encouraging" attitude in his St. 
Patrick's Day address and the continued interest by the U.S. 
Government in helping the peace process. "This administration 
has clearly shown its willingness to take a fresh approach to 
this conflict and the means by which it can be ended," added Mr. 
Adams. 
  But the Sinn Fein president attacked remarks in the House of 
Commons by Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew who claimed that 
the Irish Republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland 
was an "anachronism." 
  Mr. Adams asked: "What of Britain's claim of sovereignty? Is 
the Government of Ireland Act not an issue? Are we to accept 
that there is no dispute over sovereignty? Has Mr. Mayhew not 
simply dismissed the national aspirations of Irish nationalists? 
How can there be equality if our aspirations are anachronistic?"

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>
  [Excerpts] The extraordinary skill and courage of an Army 
helicopter crew shot down by the IRA in Northern Ireland came in 
for high praise today. The Lynx helicopter was hit in the tail 
and disabled by a Mark 15 mortar bomb as it hovered 100-feet 
above the security force base at Crossmaglen in south Armagh. 
Yet with supreme skill the crew managed to crash land the 
aircraft inside the base -- avoiding private housing nearby. 
They baled out in the dark during the terrifying incident on 
Saturday night -- then went back to the helicopter as it began 
to turn into a fireball. Despite their own injuries, they 
rescued a seriously injured policeman who had been travelling 
with them. Seconds later the helicopter exploded, sending a 
fireball shooting into the sky. 
  At a press conference in Co [County] Armagh today, RUC 
[Royal 
Ulster Constabulary] Deputy Assistant Chief Constable Bill 
McCreesh said that but for the skill and professionalism 
displayed by the pilot and helicopter crew there could have been 
a major tragedy. And he furiously condemned the IRA mortar 
attack on the helicopter, launched over a residential area, as 
"lunacy." 
  Although the helicopter was badly damaged, the pilot managed 
to land it within the security force base. "Had it come down in 
the town itself many lives would have been put at risk," he 
said. The mortar had been fired from the town square 150 yards 
across local property into the base, he added. 
  It was the first time a mortar had been used to down a 
helicopter and investigating officers were uncertain whether it 
or the base was the target. There have a series of mortar bomb 
attacks on the heavily-fortified joint Army and police border 
station. 
  He slammed the IRA for an indiscrimate, reckless and 
ruthless 
attack which could have had horrendous consequences and again 
displayed the terrorists' utter lack of human and Christian 
feeling. 
  "This mortar attack was not just an attack on an Army 
helicopter but on the complete community of Crossmaglen. For 
any bomber to launch a mortar from, and over, a residential 
area, is a complete act of lunacy," said Mr McCreesh. [passage 
omitted] 
  Local MP Seamus Mallon (Newry and Armagh) launched a verbal 
broadside on Sinn Fein and the IRA for carrying out the attack 
when they were spending their time talking about peace. The 
Social and Democratic Party deputy leader said: "I am very 
angry. God knows how many people could have been killed in that 
attack -- thankfully they weren't." He said Northern Ireland 
had gone back to the syndrome "where we have Sinn Fein and their 
spokesmen talking peace in the morning and carrying out these 
murderous attacks through the IRA in the evening." 
  "I think that is what is revolting many people within this 
country," Mr Mallon declared. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Palermo, Sicily, March 20 (AFP) -- Silvio 
Berlusconi, the Italian press magnate and politician, Sunday [20 
March] denied reports of collusion between his Forza Italia (Go 
Italy) party and the mafia. 
  "All the votes for Forza Italia obtained in Sicily and in 
all 
Italy will be votes against the mafia," the rightwinger told a 
rally of 5,000 supporters, a week to the day before the next 
Italian legislative elections. 
  "In parliament and in government we will use these votes to 
lead a vigorous support for the fight against organised crime," 
Berlusconi said, microphone in hand, as he spoke to the crowd. 
  Leftwing politicians have accused Forza Italia of attempting 
to attract mafia support for its candidates, effectively giving 
it a large block vote. 
  "Pure slander," said a party spokesman. 
  However turncoats from the Cosa Nostra Sicilian mafia have 
accused one of the leading figures in Berlusconi's media empire, 
Fininvest, of having a money-laundering agreement with mafia 
bosses, the Italian press said Sunday. 
  Marcello Dell'Ultri, manager of Publitalia, the advertising 
arm of Fininvest, has firmly denied the accusations. "Delirious 
accusations, completely unworthy slanders, without any 
foundation," he said Sunday. 
  "I don't believe it, it's delirium, someone wants to stop 
me. 
They are trying to criminalise a movement entirely made up of 
new people," Berlusconi said here. 
  The leader of the former communist Democratic Party of the 
Left, Achille Occhetto, told an electoral meeting in Naples 
Friday that Forza Italia had "got the declared support of the 
Piromalli boss," head of a southern Italian mafia family. 
  During a radio debate with Berlusconi on Sunday, Occhetto 
renewed his accusations. "It is paradoxical to accuse a party, 
which presents itself for the first time, of collusion with the 
mafia," the media magnate responded. 
  The Christian Democrat Minister of the Interior, Nicola 
Mancino, said in an interview with the Naples daily Il Mattino 
on Saturday, that there were "rumours which must be verified" 
that the mafia was preparing to vote for Forza Italia. 
  Berlusconi said that remark was "way below the minister's 
role."

  [Editorial Report] Correspondent Claudio Rinaldi published 
a commentary in the Rome weekly L'ESPRESSO entitled "Ten Good 
Reasons Not To Trust Berlusconi" in which he outlines the main 
reasons why he thinks voters should not elect Forza Italia 
leader Silvio Berlusconi to head the next government. 
  Rinaldi cites Berlusconi's claim that popularity polls 
currently give him 36 percent of the votes as a good reason to 
focus attention on the man who may well become prime minister 
after the 27-28 March general elections. Attention should turn 
especially to Berlusconi's "most hidden characteristics," 
Rinaldi adds, because Berlusconi has claimed that his success is 
due to the trust he inspires in people. Rinaldi presents 10 
reasons why he believes that trust must be denied. 
<H5>  1. Too Much Power </H5>
  Should Berlusconi win, Rinaldi writes, he would at the same 
time hold political power as head of government, economic power 
as owner of Italy's fourth largest private business group, and 
cultural power as the owner of three private television channels 
and of Mondadori, Italy's largest publishing company. Should a 
Berlusconi government decide to cut the number of state-owned 
RAI television stations or ban them from advertising, the 
question would arise whether this had been done for the good of 
the general public or for the good of Berlusconi-owned stations. 
The same question would be asked about privatizing the 
state-owned GS supermarkets, currently in direct competition 
with Berlusconi's Standa supermarkets, and about appointments to 
head government-owned banks that, Rinaldi claims, have 
overextended credit to Berlusconi. 
<H5>  2. Habit of Circumventing Law </H5>
  According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi has repeatedly violated the 
laws on telecommunications. On 28 February he was accused of 
violating television regulations for election campaigns. The 
Editors' Federation produced evidence that Channel 5, one of 
Berlusconi's main television outlets, almost always exceeds the 
daily advertising quota established by the Mammi Law. 
Berlusconi's brother, Paolo, who was recently arrested on a 
bribery charge, has alleged that in the past, Berlusconi's 
construction company, Edilnord Commerciale, received unbilled 
materials. Berlusconi's "pseudo- sale" of the daily IL 
GIORNALE, Rinaldi writes, is now being investigated by the 
authorities responsible for press affairs. 
<H5>  3. Deceitfulness Charged </H5>
  Regarding the sale of real estate property in the exclusive 
Milano 3 residential section of Milan, Paolo Berlusconi said 
that he had accepted a low offer made for the property because 
the Berlusconi concern "needed to sell." However, Silvio 
Berlusconi had given a different explanation, that the decision 
had been made so that Milano 3 should not be a city just for the 
rich. As a result of the sale, Berlusconi claimed, some of the 
property was sold to public associations so that less wealthy 
families could occupy the apartments. Rinaldi writes that, in 
Berlusconi's mind, "the need to sell" had become a philantrophic 
decision in favor of the less fortunate. 
<H5>  4. Over-reliance on Polls </H5>
  Noting Berlusconi's claims that polls show him leading with 
36 percent of the votes and Italian Popular Party secretary Mino 
Martinazzoli trailing with only 3 percent, Rinaldi finds three 
problems with what he calls this over-reliance on polls. First, 
he questions the honesty of a candidate who celebrates his 
constant rise in the polls and prophesizes doom for his 
opponents by passing off data that no one can verify as 
indisputable truth. The second is a legal problem. The law 
prohibits any polls from being published 15 days before the 
elections, but also states that from 30 to 15 days before the 
elections, only polls that include all the pertinent data and 
methodology may be published. Rinaldi indicates that polls 
commissioned by Berlusconi may not meet that legal standard. 
The third problem is political, Rinaldi writes. Berlusconi's 
decisions, Rinaldi maintains, are totally founded on poll 
results, including his choice of candidates, the direction of 
the party's program, and the timing and methods of his 
propaganda. Even if the polls were honestly conducted-- "and 
that's doubtful," Rinaldi adds--a government official should not 
follow the public's every mood. "The idea that decisions would 
be made on the answers provided by [public opinion researcher 
and Forza Italia candidate] Gianni Pilo is enough to make one 
shiver," Rinaldi writes. 
<H5>  5. Helped Legitimize Neofascists </H5>
  According to Rinaldi, Berlusconi did everything possible to 
legitimize Gianfranco Fini, secretary of the neofascist Italian 
Social Movement (MSI), recently renamed National Alliance. 
Rinaldi cites a series of Berlusconi statements on the subject: 
"I would vote for Fini in the Rome mayoral elections." "There 
is a real effort at renewal." "Those who wave the scarecrows of 
fascism show their moral baseness." "I don't believe a movement 
such as National Alliance can be said to belong to the extreme 
right." "National Alliance members have been converted to 
liberal-democratic ideas." Rinaldi finds it strange that 
Berlusconi believes that former communists have remained 
communist but that former neofascists have been converted to 
democracy. By opening the doors to the neofascists so quickly, 
Berlusconi has forced the country to "play with fire," Rinaldi 
writes. 
<H5>  6. Indebtedness Problem </H5>
  Rinaldi notes that Berlusconi has indebted his conglomerate, 
Fininvest, and that his explanation that he was forced to go 
into debt to compete with RAI is not plausible. No one forced 
Berlusconi to compete with RAI, Rinaldi writes, adding 
ironically that he could well have borrowed another 20 billion 
lire and competed with Fiat. Beyond the debts themselves, 
Rinaldi criticizes Berlusconi's way of dealing with his debt 
load by cutting expenses. Berlusconi does not plan to give up 
any of his subsidiaries or inject fresh capital into Fininvest, 
says Rinaldi, and believes his indebtedness is quite normal. 
Rinaldi wonders whether Berlusconi would handle Italy's huge 
deficit in the same manner: "Will he trust in God, as he now 
does, trusting in his creditors' patience, or will he make 
things worse by reducing taxes, as he is promising?" 
<H5>  7. Lack of Transparency in Business Arrangements </H5>
  Although Berlusconi insists he believes in the free market 
system, he often excludes his businesses from free market 
practices. Except for Standa and Mondadori, he avoids listing 
his other companies on the stock market. Fininvest is headed by 
"22 strange holding companies named First, Second, Third, etc.," 
Rinaldi claims. While Berlusconi swears that he and his family 
own all 22 companies, documentation to that effect has never 
been made public. Berlusconi once explained that he was advised 
to organize Fininvest that way in the 1970s because there had 
been kidnapping threats against his son and this arrangement 
would help hide his assets. Rinaldi counters that this does not 
explain why there are 22 companies when just a couple would have 
served the same purpose. Even though the kidnapping threat is 
over, Rinaldi adds, Fininvest's organization has remained the 
same. 
<H5>  8. Allied to `Provincial' Forces </H5>
  Berlusconi insists that the economy can be savied only by 
beating the Democratic Party of the Left, arguing that if the 
leftists entered the government many businessmen would move out 
of Italy. However, something very different has happened so 
far, Rinaldi observes. Since a Berlusconi victory at the polls 
has become a possibility, the stock market has steadily 
dropped--while, on the other hand, the same stock market rose in 
December when many leftists won in local elections. 
Berlusconi's enthusiasm and ability to improvise are not 
sufficient to succeed in international economic competion, 
Rinadldi concludes, especially when the Italian magnate allies 
himself with forces such as the "provincial Northern League and 
the antiquated, nationalist MSI." 
<H5>  9. Intolerant of Disagreement </H5>
  Rinaldi reports that when asked whether it is true that 
Berlusconi suffers moments of depression, one of his 
collaborators replied, "Only when someone does not agree with 
him." When Berlusconi was asked whether he was always right, he 
did not deny it, Rinaldi writes, and when asked to name some of 
his defects he could not name even one, replying, "I nominate 
myself for sainthood." 
<H5>  10. Surrounded by Yes-men </H5>
  Berlusconi has been accused of running his party like a 
business. While he has rejected the accusation, many of Forza 
Italia's candidates, such as Antonio Martino, Vittorio Dotti, 
and Cesare Previti are Berlusconi's long-time business 
consultants and advisors, Rinaldi writes. Forza Italia's 14 
billion lire expenses are guaranteed by Berlusconi himself--a 
unique case in the political world, according to Rinaldi. The 
only reason Forza Italia exists, Rinaldi continues, is because 
one day Berlusconi decided he would create it and pay for it. 
It is a one-man party, and those surrounding Berlusconi are 
people on his payroll who do nothing more than follow their 
boss's wishes, Rinaldi maintains. If everything goes according 
to Berlusconi's plan, Rinaldi concludes, "we will soon have our 
one-man government."

<F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League leader Umberto Bossi </F>
by Daniele Vimercati in Rome; date not given: "Why I Am 
Attacking Berlusconi"] 
  [Text] Rome -- [Vimercati] Bossi, you have now become a 
stonyhearted guest at all the election debates. Adversaries 
and allies say that you are the pest of the pole of freedoms, 
the person that is making a government accord between the 
center-right forces impossible. Are you not afraid that these 
accusations will make you lose your grassroots' consensus? 
  [Bossi] I know very well that somebody is trying to 
penetrate 
into the League, break up the movement, and put me in 
difficulty. They know that I am what makes the League stick 
together and they want to strike at me in order to strike at the 
heart of our federalist project. But they will not succeed and 
if they think they can, they do not know the League. 
  [Vimercati] But is it true that many League members go to 
[Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's conventions? 
  [Bossi] I do not perform blood tests on the Forza Italia 
supporters. I can only say that I spoke at length with all the 
League candidates (and outside the headquarters in Via Bellaria 
for the first time there were military police with bulletproof 
vests in a state of alert, IL GIORNALE editor's note) and they 
agree with me on our political line. I have no doubts 
concerning the League's grassroots: It was precisely the 
activists and the simple supporters who rebelled against the 
recycled people of the Berlusconi list of candidates. I 
explained the sense of the operation and now I am satisfied 
because the opinion polls, the real ones and not the propaganda 
ones, say that the League is growing. Also, primarily in the 
north, it has already overtaken Forza Italia, which had grown a 
great deal thanks to the massive television propaganda. Now the 
pole of freedoms is stronger, but thanks to the League. 
  [Vimercati] Regarding relations with Berlusconi in the 
so-called pole of freedoms: After so many election campaign 
controversies perhaps the time has come to reason. Do you feel 
up to it? 
  [Bossi] I have been reasoning since the League was born. If 
not, we would have never reached this point. 
  [Vimercati] You are presenting candidates on the same list 
as 
Berlusconi, yet not a single day goes by without your insulting 
him. What sense does this row have? 
  [Bossi] First, it is not a row, and I am not insulting 
anybody. I am telling the truth, I am the only political leader 
who always tells the people the truth and nothing but the truth. 
  [Vimercati] Even when you say that Berlusconi is a P2 
[outlawed Masonic lodge] member, the head of the recycled 
people, a man of the old regime? 
  [Bossi] Unfortunately for him this is the truth. His 
membership in the Masonic lodge has been reported, his 
connection with the old five-party coalition cannot be denied, 
not even by his press office. The facts show his role as a 
recycled person. 
  [Vimercati] If this is how things stand, why did you forge 
an 
alliance with Berlusconi? 
  [Bossi] Because I know well, and history teaches me that all 
the revolutions had to accept the transmigration of a part of 
the old system into the new. Forza Italia is the recycled quota 
that the League revolution must realistically accept. 
  [Vimercati] Well then, if you accept it why continue 
attacking Forza Italia? 
  [Bossi] All I have to do is clear things up, with the 
movement and all the citizens. I want the political 
significance of this electoral accord to be clear. I have not 
been saying these things just today and not even since 
yesterday. I have always said these things very clearly, even 
in Berlusconi's face, and even before the accord. 
  [Vimercati] Okay, but now that the election battle has begun 
you should be firing against the enemy not against the ally. Do 
you not think so? 
  [Bossi] War against Occhetto's statist Left was declared 
some 
time ago. I have always said that they will make the state go 
bankrupt. Therefore, there is no doubt that the votes must go 
to the pole of freedoms. This matter has been settled. 
However, something else must be explained to the people. 
[Vimercati] That is? 
  [Bossi] That is, there are two forces within the pole of 
freedoms. One wants a change, in fact it was the creator of 
change. The other represents the quota of recycled people that 
are necessary in any revolution. If this second force grows too 
much, there is a risk that a stop will be put to change. For 
this reason, in the majority vote, the votes must necessarily go 
to the pole of freedoms, but in the proportional lower house 
vote, Guerriero of the north should be crossed in the gray 
voting card. Otherwise, there will be no change and the 
five-party coalition will resurrect. This is what I continue to 
repeat, even if the newspapers write what they want. 
  [Vimercati] I seem to understand that you are afraid of 
losing your leadership. 
  [Bossi] This is not the problem. I fear that we will lose 
sight of the final objective and the only one that can change 
this country and transform it, make it European: federalism. 
Without the League there are no federalist prospects for Italy. 
This means that the hands of the centralist parties would go 
back to reaching out toward the wallets of the north. This is a 
fatal risk that I must denounce. Woe to us if the League does 
not win, for the north it would be another century of centralist 
slavery. 
  [Vimercati] The problem is another one, however: the 
government. The people would like to vote for a potential 
majority. Is a League-Forza Italia government possible? 
  [Bossi] The League will propose its programs, its 
liberalistic and federalist ideas. Those who agree, will be in 
the government. It is not a matter of majorities. Let this be 
clear, I will not form a single group with Berlusconi. He will 
go his way and will have to choose whether to stay with us for 
federalism, or with the Christian Democrats, or perhaps the 
Left. The Left that is currently directing strong attacks at me 
and that is trying to make me lose even the battle for the Milan 
seat. 
  [Vimercati] To tell the truth, today the most violent attack 
comes from the Right: [National Alliance leader] Fini says that 
a political accord with the League is even possible. As long as 
Bossi is no longer party secretary. 
  [Bossi] Right and Left: They are all part of the same band. 
I have been repeating this for some time: Right and Left know 
that without Bossi, and with the League in pieces, everything 
would begin again as it was before. The hands of the nepotistic 
south would reach out toward the wallets of the north. The MSI 
[Italian Social Movement] people are objectively tied to 
paraMafia interests and are nervous because of this: They know 
that the north is not stupid and that it will sweep them away, 
it will not give them even a vote.
